HARMON INDUSTRIES TO CLOSE THREE FACILITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLUE SPRINGS, Mo. _ Harmon Industries Inc. is closing three
facilities, including one in Lee's Summit, as a part of a
companywide downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon, a Blue Springs-based manufacturer, announced the
restructuring on the day it reported lower earnings for the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon said the closings would reduce employment companywide by
about 200 people. However, the consolidation of out-of-state work
into Harmon's plants in Grain Valley and Warrensburg, Mo., will
result in additional jobs there.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a warehouse operation in Lee's Summit, Harmon is
closing plants in Riverside, Calif., and Long Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   About 45 persons work in Harmon's Lee's Summit plant, and most
of them will be transferred to the Warrensburg plant by the third
quarter of 2000, said Stephen L. Schmitz, Harmon's chief financial
officer. Other support and administrative staff at Lee's Summit
will transfer to Grain Valley, Schmitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Schmitz said about 30 employees from Riverside and Long Island
would eventually transfer to Harmon's Missouri facilities, mostly
to Warrensburg. Those moving to the region will include employees
in assembly, engineering and research, Schmitz said.
</P>
<P>
   The closing of the Riverside plant, which employed 200 people,
will begin immediately and be completed by the middle of next year,
the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The Long Island plant should be closed by the end of the first
quarter next year, said Bjorn E. Olsson, Harmon's president and
chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Once the consolidation is complete, Harmon will have about 1,000
employees in Missouri and 2,000 companywide.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon makes safety equipment for railroads and mass transit
systems. Olsson said a technological shift in the production of
circuit boards for its products prompted the company to
restructure.
</P>
<P>
   ``In practice, we'll need less labor-hours,'' he said. ``We need
30 to 35 fewer production people because of the change in internal
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Olsson said the consolidation of the railroad industry had
forced Harmon to reduce expenses to remain competitive in bidding
for new projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago, we had 16 major railroads as our customers,''
he said. ``Next year, there will be six.''
</P>
<P>
   Harmon's earnings have fallen sharply this year after the
company posted record profits in 1998. The company said its
international and mass transit businesses remained strong in the
third quarter, but the railroad business suffered.
</P>
<P>
   For the three months that ended Sept. 30, the company earned
$1.09 million, or 10 cents a share, on $73.81 million in revenue.
During the same time last year, the company earned $2.47 million,
or 23 cents a share, on $57.75 million in sales.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the restructuring is expected to be about $16
million. A charge of $10 million to $12 million is expected to be
taken in the fourth quarter, with the balance being booked in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For the first nine months of the year, Harmon earned $3.68
million, or 33 cents a share, on $214.54 million in revenue. Last
year at this time, the company's earnings were $9.88 million, or 93
cents a share, on $192.02 million in sales.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time in Virginia's long political history,
Republicans took control Tuesday of the General Assembly, seizing a
majority in the House of Delegates and holding onto the slim edge
the party already had in the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, which came on a day in which off-year elections
were held in dozens of cities and states around the country, not
only greatly strengthened the Republican hold on Virginia _
Republicans grabbed control of the governor's, lieutenant
governor's and attorney general's posts in 1997 _ but also
underscored the party's continuing strength, overall, in the South.
</P>
<P>
   In all, both parties spent more than $25 million in the struggle
to gain full control of the Assembly, not just because control of
the Assembly opens the way to passage of the controlling party's
agenda but also because the party that controls the Assembly, or
any state legislature, going into the next century will be able to
influence the congressional redistricting process that follows the
2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats also enjoyed some victories in Tuesday's balloting
around the nation, which party leaders were watching carefully for
hints, if any, of things to come in next year's general election.
Democrats captured the mayor's offices in both Indianapolis and
Columbus, Ohio, two major Midwestern cities that had been in
Republican hands for almost three decades.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Gov. Paul Patton of Kentucky, also a Democrat,
was re-elected to a second term.
</P>
<P>
   In voting in which party identification played no role, Maine
voters approved a ballot measure to legalize marijuana for medical
use.
</P>
<P>
   In Indianapolis, Bart Peterson, a developer, captured most of
that city's growing minority vote to become the first Democratic
mayor in 30 years. He beat Sue Anne Gilroy, a Republican serving
her second term as Indiana's secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   In the Columbus race, the Democratic winner was Michael Coleman,
a city councilman who, when he takes office next year, will be the
city's first black mayor. Coleman defeated Dorothy Teater, a
Republican who has been a county commissioner for the past 15 years
and was trying to become the first woman mayor of Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   In elections elsewhere, Mississippians elected a governor,
Virginia and New Jersey got new Legislatures and there were
important mayor's races in Philadelphia, San Francisco and
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, the ballot carried referendums on banning late-term
abortion procedures and legalizing medical uses of marijuana, and
in the San Francisco area there were referendums on banning ATM
fees and slowing growth. Voters in Colorado and Kansas City, Mo.,
voted on referendums to finance urban transit systems and those in
Houston, San Antonio, St. Paul, Minn., and Scottsdale, Ariz., voted
on financing new sports centers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kentucky governor's race, Patton, the first Kentucky
chief executive eligible to seek a successive term in two
centuries, thanks to a recent change in state law, captured about
60 per cent of the vote in easily sweeping past his two leading
challengers, Peppy Martin, a Republican, and Gatewood Galbraith, a
member of the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a message in the Patton victory in a state in which
both parties have been competitive in recent years, it was that
taking on an incumbent is almost always an uphill proposition and
taking on an incumbent with a job approval rating close to 65 per
cent is close to impossible, especially for challengers with low
name recognition and fringe issues.
</P>
<P>
   Patton, a moderate, did not bother to start campaigning until
September and did not run his first television commercial until
last week. Mainly, he pitched his record of pushing for jobs,
education reform, government efficiency, better health care and
tougher penalities for lawbreakers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Martin, a freelance publicist, was shunned by many prominent
members of her party after she charged, without offering any
evidence, that 80 per cent of Kentucky's sheriffs and 30 percent of
its state police officers were involved in the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   Galbraith, a lawyer, called for the legalization of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The Indianapolis mayor's race was the most expensive in the
city's history, with more than $5 million spent overall by
Peterson, who pushed downtown development and crime control, and
Ms. Gilroy, who hoped her promise to shrink government would make
her the city's first woman mayor. Peterson won by about 10
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   But equally as important as the money poured into the campaign
was the changing makeup of the city. Many whites, especially
Republicans, have moved to the suburbs in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The incumbent mayor, Stephen Goldsmith, a Republican who had
been in office since 1991, chose not to run for a third term.
</P>
<P>
   In the contest in Columbus, where Republicans had held the
mayor's office since 1972, Coleman beat Ms. Teater by almost 10
percentage points after campaigning on a promise to improve city
neighborhoods. Ms. Teater sought to paint Coleman as a city
councilman who had cast votes that wasted city money. The incumbent
mayor, Greg Lashutka, first elected in 1991, chose not to run.

AFTER A SLOPPY START, NETS FALL TO PACERS, 119-112 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Don Casey's first regular season game as
the New Jersey Nets' unquestioned head coach - without the
``interim'' attached to his title - started horribly. Jamie Feick,
a former journeyman-type player whom Casey had given a chance to
shine, complained at the pregame shootaround about not starting.
Only 13,051 fans bothered to show up for the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana Pacers began with an offensive explosion that
brought to mind the National Basketball Association circa 1975. And
the melting ice beneath the Continental Arena court kept finding
its way onto the floor, delaying the game several times.
</P>
<P>
   But thankfully for Casey, who is existing on a one-year
contract, things got better. After securing just 3 rebounds in a
first quarter in which they allowed 41 points, the Nets, who
trailed by as many as 19 points, rallied to give one of the Eastern
Conference's top teams a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   With Stephon Marbury scoring as if playing in a schoolyard and
Feick grabbing rebounds like a child reaching into a bag of
Halloween candy, the Nets pulled to within 2 points in the final
minute before losing, 119-112.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of encouraging because of who we came back
against,'' said Casey, whose team visits the Cleveland Cavaliers
Wednesday night. ``That's a veteran team that stays poised to the
end, but we played good basketball and got back in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Marbury, in an outstanding performance, led everyone with 39
points, 24 after the Nets entered the locker room trailing 67-55.
Dating back to last season, it was his fifth straight game of 30 or
more points and 2 points shy of his career-high. Marbury attempted
a career-high 34 shots, making 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a basketball game and you don't go on the court thinking,
`I'm going to take 25 shots or so,''' ' Marbury said. ``I was just
trying to win. It was all in the flow of the game. It was just
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Feick, who sulked after the shootaround because Jim McIlvaine
replaced him in the starting lineup, had a game-high 17 rebounds
despite playing 10 minutes before collecting his first one. He was
smacked hard in the nose twice in the fourth quarter and suffered a
broken nose late in the game and could not speak afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury and Feick hooked up beautifully, each doing what he does
best, to cut Indiana's lead to 2 points with 41.6 seconds
remaining. Marbury found his way into the lane and missed a
dazzling layup attempt, but Feick got a hand on the ball to tip the
ball it back to his point guard. Marbury, surrounded by Pacers,
then put in a double-pump layup to make it 112-110.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Miller, who led Indiana with 27 points, answered with a
22 footer, but Marbury scored again with 20 seconds remaining.
Marbury had a chance to cut the lead to a point, but missed a free
throw after Feick was hit inadvertently by Miller with 18 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   With the delays and referee whistles taking the game into the
wee hours, the teams toiled for 2 hours and 53 minutes. The
referees, adhering to the new no-touch defensive rules, called 77
fouls as the teams combined to shoot 99 free throws. Four players
fouled out, including Scott Burrell, Keith Van Horn and Kendall
Gill of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the longest games and one of the strangest games
as well,'' said Indiana coach Larry Bird. ``The first few games of
the season, the referees will call a lot of fouls and after 10
games or so they'll stop calling the fouls.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird's team scored the game's first two baskets on long jump
shots by Miller and Mark Jackson. The only encouraging development
for the Nets in the early going was the shooting of Burrell.
Displaying range and a touch that has eluded him since he joined
the club last season, Burrell made all three of his 3-point
attempts and two free throws to score 11 points in the first
quarter. His defense, however, was as shabby as his offense was
effective.
</P>
<P>
   Jalen Rose, Indiana's shifty small forward, treated Burrell like
a pylon, driving around him at will in scoring 15 first-quarter
points. When Burrell wasn't getting lost, he was fouling. After
committing two fouls in nine minutes of the first quarter, he was
whistled for two in one minute during the second period. This by a
player the Nets' coaching staff viewed as a defensive stopper and
hoped his offense would come around.
</P>
<P>
   Burrell's play was symbolic of the Nets. They actually shot
reasonably well, hitting 50 percent of their first-quarter shots
and finishing the half at 45.9 percent. Their accuracy was
admirable considering their limited offensive repertory. With
absolutely no post threat, they were an exclusively drive-and-kick
team, with Marbury blowing by defenders and drawing double-teams to
get his teammates open shots.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing changed until Gheorghe Muresan, the Nets' 7-foot-7-inch
center, entered to cheers midway through the second quarter with
the Nets down by 58-40. Though he wasn't Chamberlainesque, he could
at least post up a defender, receive an entry pass and draw
attention. With Muresan in the game, at times looking to score and
drawing fouls, the Nets' offense became more varied.
</P>
<P>
   The defense, on the other hand, was pitiful. Indiana, with three
double-figure scorers, shot 54.5 percent in the first half and made
5 of 11 3-point attempts. The Nets' rebounding was just as poor in
the half. They may not have missed Jayson Williams very much during
the preseason, but his absence was glaring over the first 24
minutes. As Williams sat courtside in a fashionable black suit, the
Pacers grabbed nearly every missed shot while the Nets reached
fruitlessly for the ball. The first-quarter rebounding discrepancy
looked like a misprint, Indiana ahead by 14-3. It was 25-15 at
intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Feick, the man the Nets' paid $15 million over six years to
soften the loss of Williams, spent 10 minutes on the floor before
securing his first rebound. He might have been thrown off his game
initially by what he viewed as a pregame snub.
</P>
<P>
   After starting the final 14 games of last season and all six
exhibition games he played in, Feick, who averaged 12.8 rebounds in
the preseason, was benched for matchup reasons. Thinking the 6-8
Feick would have trouble guarding Rik Smits, Indiana's 7-4 center,
Casey replaced him with McIlvaine, who is 7-1. Furious, Feick sat
courtside after the shootaround and sulked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me,'' Feick said. ``With it being opening night and
with all that is happening, I feel like I've earned the right to
start. Even if I started the game, and they brought somebody in
right away, I just wanted to start.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the opposite happened, as Feick subbed for McIlvaine after
just 4 minutes 4 seconds because McIlvaine had two fouls. Casey
downplayed Feick's disgust, but General Manager John Nash said more
controversies could await the deep and talented Nets.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we get people back, the problem is going to become
exacerbated,'' Nash said before the game. ``When Kerry Kittles gets
healthy that's going to put intense pressure on Coach Casey to
either start Kerry or perhaps consider moving Kendall Gill to small
forward, which puts pressure on Scott Burrell.''
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday night's performance, the pressure should be on all
the Nets.

WHITMAN'S WITHDRAWS OFFER TO PURCHASE ROCKY MOUNTAIN CHOCOLATE
FACTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Whitman's Candies Inc. has withdrawn an offer
of about $16 million for Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory Inc.,
saying the Colorado company negotiated in bad faith.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's, which is owned by Russell Stover Candies in Kansas
City, in May offered $5.75 for each Rocky Mountain share. Whitman's
and Russell Stover, which get most of their revenue by selling
wholesale, were interested in Rocky Mountain's chain of retail
candy stores.
</P>
<P>
   But the original bid was rejected. The offer was then sweetened
to $6.25 per share, and Whitman's said Rocky Mountain's management
had supported the merger at that price.
</P>
<P>
   Rocky Mountain said its board rejected the higher offer last
week primarily because of improvement in its financial results over
the last several months.
</P>
<P>
   The Durango, Colo., company requested a ``substantially'' higher
offer. But Whitman's said Tuesday that it was withdrawing its offer
and was no longer interested in Rocky Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bad-faith rejection of the merger based on price leads us
to believe that Rocky Mountain never intended to do the deal in the
first place,'' said Richard Masinton, Whitman's chief financial
officer.
</P>
<P>
   A Rocky Mountain executive could not be reached for comment. In
a statement last week, the company's board said it would not
interfere with a tender offer by Whitman's at the $6.25-a-share
price.
</P>
<P>
   But Whitman's said Tuesday that the offer was meaningless
because Rocky Mountain management and insiders held sufficient
stock to prevent Whitman's from getting the more than two-thirds
ownership it wanted.

CHILDREN'S MERCY HOSPITAL DEDICATES RESEARCH LABORATORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Doctors prescribe to children about 450 drugs
that have never been directly tested on them for safety and
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   That means researchers at Children's Mercy Hospital have their
work cut out for them.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Children's Mercy formally dedicated its new research
laboratory for studying how medications should be used on children.
Children's Mercy is one of 13 medical centers in the nation funded
by the National Institutes of Health to conduct such studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing catch-up,'' said Ralph Kauffman, director of
research at Children's Mercy. ``Children have tended to be ignored
in many aspects of medical research.''
</P>
<P>
   The new laboratory facilities were funded through a $1.5 million
grant from the Hoechst Marion Roussel Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Pediatric research has been slighted for two reasons, Kauffman
said.
</P>
<P>
   The government officials in charge of research grants generally
had little experience in pediatric research, a situation that is
beginning to change.
</P>
<P>
   And drug companies have had little financial incentive to test
drugs for the much smaller pediatric market.
</P>
<P>
   Congress last year revised the law governing the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration to make it financially advantageous for
pharmaceutical companies to test drugs on children.
</P>
<P>
   A company that does such studies on a drug it produces is now
eligible for an additional six months of exclusive marketing rights
to that drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could be worth a half-billion to a billion dollars in new
sales,'' Kauffman said. ``That's put the profit motive back in.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, the Food and Drug Administration has received
about 100 requests to conduct pediatric studies of drugs based on
this new legislation, and manufacturers already have done the
research and gained extended exclusivity for six drugs, Kauffman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen more pediatric studies initiated this year than
ever before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to test drugs on children in the past has done real
harm, Kauffman said. For example, the antibiotic tetracycline, once
commonly prescribed to children, can blacken children's teeth and
leave them vulnerable to decay.
</P>
<P>
   ``A whole generation of children had their teeth permanently
damaged,'' Kauffman said. ``It took about 20 years for us to
understand why, because based on the adult experience with the drug
there was no reason to expect it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Mercy pediatric pharmacology research program
began several years ago. More than 1,000 children have been
involved in studies of antibiotics, drugs for diabetes and heart
conditions, vaccines and other medications.
</P>
<P>
   With the new facilities, the Children's Mercy program has become
one of the largest in the nation, Kauffman said. About 50 doctors
and nurses at Children's Mercy are involved in more than 65 drug
studies involving about two dozen diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital received $1.9 million in drug company funding and
more than $800,000 in federal grants this year.
</P>
<P>
   Three kinds of drug research are being done at Children's Mercy,
Kauffman said:
</P>
<P>
   --Genetic studies to learn why a small number of children have
life-threatening reactions to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   --Studies of how children's growing and maturing bodies
influence their response to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   --Studies to determine safe and effective doses for children of
drugs under development.
</P>
<P>
   Some drug tests can be done in a few hours; others are conducted
over many months or, in the case of growth hormone studies, many
years. The new facilities include six hospital beds stationed next
to the laboratories, making it convenient for children to stay
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a playroom outfitted with toys and crafts
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all the comforts of home: Nintendo; a VCR; TV,'' said
Kathy Johnson, clinical research coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   This proximity of patients to facilities that were built
specifically for drug research make the unit unique in North
America, said Gregory Kearns, chief of clinical pharmacology at
Children's Mercy.
</P>
<P>
   Some children involved in the hospital's drug research are ill
with infections, chronic pain or other conditions and in need of
medication.
</P>
<P>
   But others are healthy volunteers. For example, recently a group
of teen-agers spent several days at the hospital for a study to
determine the proper dosage for a tuberculosis drug.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies involve the use of over-the-counter drugs that give
researchers information that can be applied to other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   For example, by measuring how long it takes children of
different ages to metabolize the dextromethorphan in cough syrup,
researchers can predict how rapidly they will metabolize codeine,
Prozac, certain high-blood-pressure drugs and other medications.
</P>
<P>
   Parents have to approve their child's participation in drug
research, and children as young as 7 sign consent forms.
</P>
<P>
   Children's Mercy surveyed children who had volunteered and found
that most did it to help other people; 95 percent said they would
do it again, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Children's Mercy researchers have been finding ways to make drug
research safer and more comfortable for children.
</P>
<P>
   For example, they have developed a technique that allows some
tests to be done with about five drops of a child's blood, rather
than the two teaspoonfuls that used to be required.
</P>
<P>
   And they're looking for ways to avoid blood tests altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the challenges I get is to be able to do (tests) with
urine instead of blood,'' said research associate Russell
Gotschall.
</P>
<P>
   Children's Mercy began planning about nine years ago to develop
a substantial research program. Since then it has opened
laboratories to study genetics, cell biology and immunology, in
addition to the pharmacology lab.

CONSENT DECREE AGAINST NEWSPAPER EASED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL WENSKE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A federal judge on Tuesday freed The Kansas
City Star from a 42-year-old decree that prohibited the area's
largest newspaper from buying smaller local papers and offering
special advertising rates.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Gary A. Fenner signed a modified final
judgment that, in effect, removed an onerous reminder of a
less-than-stellar past when The Star was found guilty of antitrust
violations for using its monopolistic advantage to bully smaller
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really an historic moment for The Kansas City Star,''
said Arthur S. Brisbane, publisher of the newspaper. ``The
modification puts us back on equal footing with other organizations
of our kind.''
</P>
<P>
   The order followed close behind a motion filed Friday by the
Justice Department stating that a 60-day period of public comment
had not altered the conclusion of government attorneys that
modifying the Nov. 15, 1957, decree was in the public interest.
</P>
<P>
   While the modified decree eliminates the former prohibitions, it
still allows the government the authority to review in advance any
purchase by The Star of a metropolitan-area newspaper with a price
tag above $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper would be required to provide notice to the
Antitrust Division when it ``directly or indirectly acquires any
assets of, or interest in'' any newspaper with its principal
circulation in metropolitan Kansas City, according to the new
modified decree.
</P>
<P>
   Government attorneys also have the power, under certain
circumstances, to monitor The Star's compliance, and to seek to
prevent a purchase that might appear to threaten competition.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said loosening of the longstanding restrictions
resulted mainly from a change in the area's competitive landscape.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, The Star commanded a huge monopoly advantage and
wielded its clout by strong-arming advertisers, threatening to ban
them from the pages of the newspaper or give them poor positioning
if they advertised with competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of television and radio advertising and the emergence
of other media, including cable television and the Internet, have
made deep inroads into The Star's market clout.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has changed today is that there are a lot of competitors
in Kansas City,'' Brisbane said. In fact, Brisbane said, modifying
the consent decree was necessary to allow The Star to become more
efficient and to compete vigorously with the host of new media
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's attorney, Ben Mann, of the Blackwell Sanders
Peper Martin law firm, said the government agreed with The Star
that ``circumstances today were entirely different'' than when the
Justice Department brought its antitrust actions.
</P>
<P>
   The Star was forced to give up half of its media holdings,
choosing to sell WDAF-TV and WDAF radio and keep The Star and The
Kansas City Times. Losing the broadcast media cost The Star money,
as radio and television advertising later drew away profits from
print media.
</P>
<P>
   Perry Beal, executive vice president of Shepard Beal Associates,
a Kansas City media buyer, said the Kansas City market today is
``incredibly competitive. This is a very strong media market.''
</P>
<P>
   Brisbane said newspaper officials presently are ``strategically
thinking about acquisitions,'' but he declined to be specific. He
would not comment on rumors The Star has talked with officials of
The Olathe (Kan.) Daily News and with officials of Townsend
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with those two companies were unavailable for comment
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The antitrust actions brought against The Star in the 1950s were
pushed by smaller publishers who testified that The Star's heft
allowed it to push them around. In January 1953, a federal grand
jury indicted The Star, Roy A. Roberts, its president, and Emil
Sees, its advertising director, for violating the Sherman Antitrust
Act.
</P>
<P>
   Charges against Roberts were dismissed. But The Star entered
into the embarrassing consent decree, and Sees was fined.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett Smalley Jr., co-publisher of The Daily Record and The
Kansas City Daily News-Press, said he has reluctantly accepted the
new modified decree.
</P>
<P>
   While he did not object formally to the decree, he said, ``I am
really opposed to having the decree lifted.''
</P>
<P>
   Smalley's father, Garrett Smalley Sr., then was attempting to
launch a daily newspaper. He became one of the original publishers
who pressed forward with actions against The Star.
</P>
<P>
   Smalley said he recalls his father going to Washington, D.C., to
meet with then-President Harry S. Truman to enlist his help in
getting the Justice Department to pursue The Star. Without Truman's
help, he said, the action might have died.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers have opined that Truman had a political ax to
grind with The Star for its earlier pursuit of the Pendergast
political machine, which had given Truman his start in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Smalley said that even though circumstances had changed, the
taint of the earlier period remained. ``The threat is still
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While small publications in the area also sued The Star, Smalley
said most ``settled for peanuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun Publications Publisher Jim Gray declined to comment on the
case, even though his company also had pressed for The Star's early
prosecution. ``We're just trying to operate like any other
newspaper in a competitive market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At least one former employee of The Star, who remembers the
embarrassment of the 1957 decree, was elated by the modified
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite a shot in the pants when it happened. And it
caused a lot of disruption among the staff,'' recalled Cruise
Palmer, who worked on the copy desk in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, who later became an executive editor of The Star, said
``nothing like that had ever happened to The Star. Those of us who
are left are obviously glad that it's been lifted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other paper had suffered that kind of thing before. Things
were different then. Competition was competition. Things are
different these days.''

REVITALIZED JOHNSON IN SPOTLIGHT AS KNICKS TOP CAVS, 92-84 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the middle of a team trying to live up to its
introduction as the defending Eastern Conference champion on
Tuesday night, there was Larry Johnson, bending and turning and
pivoting in the paint as if he were a kid again, playing a game of
Twister.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the same Johnson last seen on the Garden floor, the
one who endured the National Basketball Association finals with a
brace on his knee, pain in his back and an ache in every joint. He
could not explain it Tuesday night _ there was no magic pill, faith
healer or potion from a witch doctor _ but Johnson felt young again
as he bounded into the post and delivered the kind of impact
usually reserved for Allan Houston, Latrell Sprewell or Patrick
Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   But with Houston and Sprewell out of sync, and Ewing out of
action for at least a month, Johnson came up with 24 points on a
9-for-16 shooting effort to help the Knicks open the season with a
92-84 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is,'' Johnson said. ``But I'm more limber
now than I have been in years. I feel as good now as I have in
years. Knock on wood, now.''
</P>
<P>
   He reached over and found a wood-grain counter in the Knicks'
locker room, and he gave it a good, firm rap after a night when he
was the solid force on the floor. Right by his side, flashing the
form he showed in the playoffs last season, Marcus Camby broke
through the surface of players around him like a dolphin arching
over the water to come up with 17 rebounds, 14 points and 5 blocked
shots.
</P>
<P>
   And after the Cavaliers' Shawn Kemp had given his shorts a good
tug, Camby even found his range for an improbable 18-foot jumper,
hitting it even though his pants were hanging near his knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shawn was pulling on me all night long,'' Camby said. ``It
felt good when I hit it. I guess I was lucky it went down.''
</P>
<P>
   Luck had little to do with the way the Knicks dominated the
Cavaliers when they wanted to. Just like last season, the Knicks
have a knack for creating drama, building a 16-point fourth-quarter
lead only to let a few careless moments allow the Cavaliers to cut
it to 9 points with 3 minutes 43 seconds left. From there, the
Knicks took over, leaning on Camby down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Although their incandescent glow from last season was more like
a dull shine Tuesday night, they supplied the kind of season opener
that belied their sluggish preseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did some very good things,'' said coach Jeff Van Gundy,
whose team outrebounded the Cavaliers by 44-38, and outshot them by
43.2 percent to 39 percent. ``Marcus was terrific. And Larry was
great. We had good play from the others, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The others included Sprewell and Houston. Beneath Johnson's
shadow, they were off their games to start the season. Houston
finished 5 for 15 with 18 points, while Sprewell scored 17 on a
6-for-14 shooting night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice way to start the season off, but there is room for
improvement,'' Sprewell said. ``We got huge games from Larry and
Marcus, and that is what really carried us.''
</P>
<P>
   Those two filled the void from Ewing's absence, at least for the
moment. Johnson filled in for Ewing's low-post presence while Camby
stuck his 6-foot-11-inch frame in front of anyone daring to drive
through the interior of the Knicks' defense.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of night the Knicks were hoping to deliver in
the wake of last season's remarkable finish.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the adrenaline of the introductions for the defending
Eastern Conference champions was still pumping through the Knicks.
At first, their energy covered up their careless spurts and
overwhelmed the Cavaliers. And for a while, this energy was all the
Knicks needed as they toyed with the Cavs.
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson was not driving into the lane and kicking the ball
out to the smooth-shooting Houston, it was Houston dashing inside
and flicking the ball out to Johnson by the 3-point line. If Camby
was not blindsiding Brevin Knight with a swiping block of his shot,
he was popping up inside for a putback to put the Knicks up, 24-9.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks unveiled the same lineup they used in last season's
finals, the same group that walked off the court in June while the
Spurs were celebrating their title by using the Garden as their
personal dance floor. But could they pick up where they left off
and look like a team that could find its way to the finals again?
</P>
<P>
   Although they put together an impressive start to the game _
which was aided by Kemp's early foul trouble _ some of their old
problems crept in as well. After a careless spurt by Sprewell, who
was stripped in the backcourt by Bob Sura, and a few ill-advised
shots by John Wallace, the Cavaliers found a crack to crawl back
into the game.
</P>
<P>
   With an 11-4 run on the back of Kemp _ who missed his first four
shots of the game before scoring 7 points in a row _ the Cavs
pulled within 3, at 43-40, with 2:40 left in the first half. The
first half ended with the Knicks up, 55-47.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not the crisp start Van Gundy was looking for, and
not the opening night he wanted for Houston. After hitting two of
his first four shots, Houston, historically a slow starter, missed
five in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks needed to find the kind of rhythm that carried them
last season. There was something about Sprewell and Houston _ a
tandem that grew into a partnership in the playoffs _ that wasn't
quite in sync. So the Knicks had to look elsewhere in the third
quarter and found Johnson and Camby to help carry them foile.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson countered his man, Kemp, shot for shot and then some. On
a twisting drive into the lane, he completed a 3-point play with
4:15 left in the third to give the Knicks a 71-58 lead.
</P>
<P>
   This came on the heels of Camby's rainbow shot, an unlikely
18-foot jumper that he hit with his shorts falling down.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever works. The Knicks used this logic to leave the third
quarter with a 74-65 lead, a nice edge but hardly comfortable.

DECISION DRAWS NEAR ON SCHOOLS' ACCREDITATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PHILLIP O'CONNOR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ U.S. District Judge Dean Whipple on Tuesday
said he would decide within two weeks whether to void a state Board
of Education decision to strip the Kansas City School District of
accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the school district and the state spent much of
Monday and Tuesday arguing before Whipple whether the state's
action would cripple the district's efforts to meet federal
court-ordered goals to improve student academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments, district lawyer Mike Delaney said the
state's action might be well-intentioned. But he said the practical
effect was to put the district on a downward spiral toward failure
at a time when it was just beginning to make strides under new
Superintendent Benjamin Demps Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's plenty of blame to go around,'' Delaney said. ``But by
all accounts we're poised at the brink of making the changes the
court has demanded. We're right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Whipple's own experts, the Desegregation Monitoring
Committee members, have recommended the state action be voided.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the state argued that the loss of accreditation _
the state's seal of approval _ was warranted. Missouri Education
Commissioner Robert Bartman had recommended the action after the
district failed to meet any of the 11 performance standards on the
latest state review. State officials hope the loss of accreditation
helps put a focus on the district's low performance and rallies the
district and community to make improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been no testimony before this court that the state's
decision is wrong,'' said Chuck Hatfield, an assistant attorney
general. ``I would suggest it's not in the best interest of the
public to declare that down is up _ that this district is
accredited.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatfield denied that the state's action would interfere with the
court's goals. But he said overturning the state board's decision
would damage efforts to use the accreditation process as a tool to
improve all Missouri districts.
</P>
<P>
   Delaney said the state ruling would force the district to
refocus on meeting the state standards needed to gain
accreditation, in areas such as attendance, vocational instruction
and student participation in higher-level classes.
</P>
<P>
   Delaney said that while those are admirable goals they would
detract from improving academic performance, the primary focus the
court has set for the district.
</P>
<P>
   And trying to do both would tax a district administration
already understaffed and overburdened.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't enough administration talent to stretch it any
thinner than it is now,'' Delaney said.
</P>
<P>
   The state's action would make it difficult to fill key
administrative positions, Delaney said. Whipple earlier this year
ordered many of the positions vacated and filled on a merit basis.
DMC Chairman John Murphy, Demps and the superintendent's chief of
staff, Cheri Shannon, all testified that the district is having a
difficult time convincing prospects to work for the district.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent instance, a man offered the job of assessment
director rejected the post after learning of the accreditation
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Both Delaney and a lawyer for the teachers union argued that the
district also would have difficulty hiring and retaining good
teachers without accreditation. They said few new teachers would
want to begin their career in an unaccredited district. Those who
have not worked the five years needed to attain tenure would most
likely move to another district. And charter schools would step up
efforts to recruit even more district teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Delaney also said the state's action would accelerate the flight
of district students to the 15 charter schools that opened this
year. Charter schools are publicly funded schools that operate free
of many local and state regulations.
</P>
<P>
   District enrollment dropped this year from 35,830 to 31,999.
Meanwhile, 4,354 students enrolled in the charters, including 3,072
who attended district schools last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That experience shows that people are frustrated and
discouraged about the prospects of success in the district,''
Delaney said. ``The notion that the stigmatizing effect of being
unaccredited is not going to drive additional students from the
district is based on hope and nothing more,'' Delaney said.
</P>
<P>
   Those students who choose to leave often have the most motivated
parents, he said. And those children are frequently among the
district's highest scoring. Their departure makes it even more
difficult for the district to improve academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   Delaney said the loss of students would exacerbate financial
problems and could eventually force the district to close
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   And he said state board members weren't the only ones frustrated
by the lack of academic improvement in the Kansas City district.
Even Whipple and the DMC have had trouble implementing their own
improvement plan for the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience this court has had should be confirmation of
the difficulty of improving achievement,'' Delaney said.
</P>
<P>
   Delaney said he was disturbed that the desegregation remedy that
began 15 years ago with the hope of drawing suburban students into
the district could end with the district paying tuition and
transportation costs for district students to attend surrounding
suburban districts. If the district lost accreditation May 1,
district students would be able to transfer to neighboring
districts willing to accept them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea seems so bizarre to me that the result should be
voided,'' Delaney said.

SPORTS COLUMN: IT'S CAMBY TO THE RESCUE AT THE GARDEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On behalf of the New York news media, and in the
spirit of the new basketball season and the coming holiday season,
I am extending the following offer to Jeff Van Gundy: If the coach
promises not to burden us with daily forecasts of doom, we hereby
agree to not overreact to any Knicks defeat until we can quantify
its impact relative to postseason math.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, of course, is off, should the Knicks go into Chicago
on Wednesday night and lose.
</P>
<P>
   I have not actually been empowered to speak for my colleagues,
but I am making this unilateral motion after sensing by the end of
the World Series that it was a little too soon for us to be
contemplating Marcus Camby posting up Shawn Kemp. But there were
Camby and the Knicks, Kemp and the Cleveland Cavaliers, the season
opener Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden, the Knicks avoiding
Van Gundy's first sky-is-falling news conference by winning, 92-84,
following a 2-6 preseason that had the coach's lip in full pout.
</P>
<P>
   After a month of preseason baseball, on opening night, the
National Basketball Association sends the colorless Cavaliers to
New York? Whatever happened to those slick marketing people? The
Garden fans responded accordingly, basically buzz-less, saving
their loudest roar for Chuck Knoblauch and Derek Jeter. The Knicks
put forth a businesslike effort, behind Larry Johnson, Allan
Houston and Camby, the willowy presence who contributed a weighty
14 points, 17 rebounds, 5 blocked shots and 3 steals.
</P>
<P>
   Who's too skinny to man the middle? As long as he avoids foul
trouble, Camby puts the numbers in the box score. Thanks to the
tugging tactics of Kemp, he may have been wearing his shorts like a
hula hoop, but Kemp, a onetime flier now rooted to the floor by too
many french fries, should have Camby's lightness of being.
</P>
<P>
   Just when Van Gundy was about to fire up the pro-Camby reform
movement by tabbing the burlier Andrew Lang as the starting center
came the news that Cleveland's talented young center, Zydrunas
Ilgauskas, was back on the injured list, where he spent most of
last season. The Cavs' rookie coach, Randy Wittman, turned to
Andrew DeClercq, moving Van Gundy to anoint Camby as the deserving
Game 1 starter.
</P>
<P>
   DeClercq on Tuesday night. Will Perdue on Wednesday night in
Chicago. Then on to Detroit, where neither Bison Dele nor Brian
Williams has yet shown up to play the Pistons' pivot. No wonder
Patrick Ewing has accelerated his workout schedule, so he may
reclaim his rightful place in the post and we, the critics, may
resume the last great debate of the 20th century: which style
better suits the Knicks, the old, predictable halfcourt offense
which produced 86 points a game over 50 games last season. Or the
high-octane, up-tempo attack that powered the Knicks to 85 points a
night during the course of 20 playoff encounters.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a great conference, or what? Where most people see
warts, Van Gundy sees wealth. In a recent teleconference that
luckily for him was available to nations which have been led to
believe that Ahmad Rashad was formerly Mike Wallace, Van Gundy
announced that ``almost every team in the East'' has a chance to
win the title. He paid homage, naturally, to Miami, where Pat Riley
is one more first-round embarrassment from coaching incognito, and
said that Charlotte has ``the most physical talent, without a
doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the Hornets' roster also includes the always
chipper Anthony Mason and Derrick Coleman, who recently sent two of
coach Paul Silas' bench players to the injured list while driving
after drinking. All I can say is that Silas should be happy Coleman
wasn't steering the team bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important for us _ especially given our schedule, which
has 10 of the first 13 and 13 of our first 18 on the road _ to
prove that we can be more than a .500 team without Patrick,'' said
Van Gundy, who should, by now, realize that the Riley way _ foot
down on the accelerator, Games 1 through 82 _ is the wrong way in a
conference with no dominant team, where there is no playoff game
that can not be won on the road. That's how Riley burned Tim
Hardaway out last time around. That's how Van Gundy contributed to
Ewing's foot problems.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky for Van Gundy and the Knicks they have Camby, who has come
a ways from his infamous 19-second debut with the Knicks last
season. ``What a difference a year makes,'' he said after the
Knicks avoided falling a game out of the East's last playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, come on, know how to take a joke. Smile, Coach. It's only
November. When I say that, I think I speak for the entire city. &QL;

   YUGOSLAVIA-U.S. (Washington) _ The Clinton administration, in a

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Ten days ago, the greatest athlete the Northwest has
ever seen stood on a podium at the World Series, surrounded by his
peers. Hank Aaron. Willie Mays. Ted Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. was on the All-Century Team, and he was all
Seattle's.
</P>
<P>
   Since signing with the Mariners as the first pick in the 1987
draft, Griffey and the M's were synonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Watching from home on television, Mariners president Chuck
Armstrong pondered all that Griffey embodied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt a strong sense of pride that he was a Mariner,''
Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   The day after that ceremony, golfer Payne Stewart was killed
when his Learjet crashed in South Dakota. Stewart lived in the same
Orlando, Fla., neighborhood as Griffey, and the two were friends.
</P>
<P>
   Had Griffey decided to stay with the Mariners, his contract
probably would have included chartered flights for his family in
small planes. The circumstances of Stewart's death weighed on his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shook Junior up,'' said Griffey's agent, Brian Goldberg.
``There were some things that he was thinking about, taking a lot
of charters, things like that. It's definitely something that's
been on his mind the last few days.''
</P>
<P>
   About 10 minutes into an emotional meeting with Armstrong,
chairman Howard Lincoln and general manager Pat Gillick on Monday,
Griffey and Goldberg indicated that Griffey no longer wanted to
play for the Mariners. The Mariners told Griffey they would grant
his request to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong had feared that decision since July, when the Mariners
_ at Griffey's request _ made an eight-year contract offer that
would have taken effect in 2000 and was worth a reported $135
million. Griffey was flattered that the team offered to tear up the
last year of his existing contract, but he said over and over that
money was not the issue.
</P>
<P>
   He would sign a rich contract wherever he went, Griffey said in
September. But the Mariners had not won to his satisfaction, and
had not always treated him with respect or valued his input. Most
important, Griffey said then, was that Seattle was so far from home
that he would need a compelling reason to be apart from his family.
</P>
<P>
   When reached at his home Tuesday night, Griffey directed all
questions to Goldberg. The agent said that as much as Griffey
wanted to play for a winner _ of the 30 All-Century members, only
Ernie Banks and Griffey have never played in a World Series _ that
was not a concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it came down to it, not really,'' Goldberg said. ``Sure,
you're always striving to win, but there is no doubt this is
strictly based on family proximity and how often he can see them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain things are nobody's fault. If Kenny had gotten married
at age 30 and had his first kid at 32, and the kid started school
when Kenny was 37, then this probably isn't something that even
becomes an issue. But Kenny did get married in his early 20s and
had a couple of kids early. The fact of the matter is, Trey is in
kindergarten this year and that puts a big burden on time with his
family if he's not within a manageable flying and spring training
distance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners tried to change Griffey's mind Monday, but in the
end, the decision was all Griffey's, as he repeatedly said during a
season in which his future _ and that of shortstop Alex Rodriguez,
also unsigned past 2000 _ was the most pressing topic around the
team.
</P>
<P>
   When Lincoln was named chairman six weeks ago, he made it clear
his first priority was to sign Griffey and Rodriguez to record
contract offers. But after Monday's meeting, Lincoln came away
believing there was nothing more the team could have done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is a sad day,'' Lincoln said. ``(But) you really have to
think about all the things that are going on in our society, good
and bad, and here is a man who, despite an incredible financial
package that was put in front of him, said, `I just want to spend
more time watching my son play baseball and being with my daughter
and my wife.'''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong left open the possibility that Griffey would return to
the Mariners if a trade could not be worked out. Griffey himself
referred to the Mariners as ``we'' at Monday's meeting, Armstrong
said, and the team is under no obligation to move him.
</P>
<P>
   But those are semantics, of course. Griffey has an enormous
market value, and the Mariners will begin trade talks at the
general managers meetings that start this weekend in Laguna Niguel,
Calif. They will rely on cooperation from Griffey, who can veto any
trade because he has 10 years of major league service, the last
five with the same team.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our standpoint, he's a very attractive player, so that
makes things easier for us,'' Gillick said. ``The only other tough
situation is he's only signed for one more year, which is a bit of
a negative for the club claiming his contract. But from an ability
standpoint, it certainly gives you something to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillick said he never had to make a trade like this in his
tenure as general manager of the Toronto Blue Jays and Baltimore
Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make sense, from my standpoint, to trade a
five-tool player,'' he said. ``That's what you're out there looking
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever he comes up with, Gillick expects to be criticized. He
referred to the Mariners' 1998 trade of pitcher Randy Johnson to
Houston, a deal that was questionable at the time but paid off last
year, and the 1989 trade of Mark Langston to Montreal, which
brought a young Johnson to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the third franchise-shaking deal the Mariners have
made, and the definitive end to an era that produced American
League West championships behind Johnson and Griffey in 1995 and
'97.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, both will be ex-Mariners, and Rodriguez could be, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never entered my mind,'' Armstrong said. ``I don't think
it's something you think about. But we've seen the baseball world
is ever-changing. Every day you're surprised by things. That's why
it's hard to predict the future.''
</P>
<P>
   And now that future no longer includes Griffey, who joined the
Mariners before they'd had a winning season and gave the club its
identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other stars on the team besides Ken,'' Lincoln said.
``Of course, Ken is recognized as an icon of the Mariners, but
certainly there are Alex, Edgar (Martinez), Jamie Moyer and a
number of other players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that you've got to remember about this business is
that someday, all the people that I just named will be old men, and
there will be new people and we'll be thinking about them. There
are many new people that are coming up through the organization,
Freddy Garcia comes to mind, and a lot of young players that we're
now bringing along.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll move on. We'll have to move on. That's baseball.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Navy searchers said Tuesday that they had definitively
determined the location of both the flight data recorder and the
cockpit voice recorder belonging to EgyptAir Flight 990, an
essential discovery in the quest to learn why the Boeing 767
plummeted into the Atlantic Ocean off New England early Sunday
morning, killing all 217 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, investigators on Tuesday night provided further
details about the aircraft's final moments. Once something went
wrong, they said, the twin-engine jet began a tortured and
ever-faster descent so precipitous that it reached supersonic
speeds of more than 660 mph. Radar sweeps tracking the aircraft's
plunge from Nantucket Island show that in the last 37 seconds of
its flight, Flight 990 twisted away from its assigned northeast
heading to make a long right-hand turn.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they hoped to integrate data from two other
radar centers _ on Long Island, N.Y., and in New Hampshire _ to
evaluate what, for now, is an eerie detail.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also said that interviews with the crews that had
flown the jet to the United States from Cairo had determined that
the plane had experienced only one recent problem: Questions about
a thrust reverser _ which redirects exhaust to slow a plane at
takeoff or landing _ had caused the airline to disable it. But they
emphasized that there was no way as yet to determine the
significance of that problem.
</P>
<P>
   Any sense of accomplishment over locating the black boxes was
quickly tempered by the reminder that natural elements would
dictate the investigation's pace, as rainstorms and 50-mph gusts
raised 20-foot waves at the accident scene, about 50 miles south of
Nantucket Island. The storm delayed some aspects of the search and
recovery mission; for example, it forced the Navy ship Mohawk,
which detected the pinger signals emanating from the two so-called
black boxes, to return to shore Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. James Graham of the Navy acknowledged Tuesday that the
storm, which is expected to last through Saturday, would hamper the
development of a sonar-aided grid of the debris field. He also said
the weather would delay plans to try to retrieve the black boxes
with a remote-operated vehicle that would be lowered about 250 feet
to the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the inclement weather signaled the added pressures
brought by time's passage: drops in water temperature as the New
England fall deepens, shifts in sands that might cover aircraft
debris, and the effect that deep-sea life will have on human
remains on the ocean floor. There were also pressures brought by
the anger and sorrow of victims' relatives.
</P>
<P>
   As those relatives gathered Tuesday at the Doubletree Islander
Hotel in Newport, R.I., officials from the National Transportation
Safety Board, which is heading the crash investigation, informed
them that only pieces of human remains had been found so far and
advised them not to expect the recovery of intact bodies. The grim
advice prompted both tears and stunned silence; one relative, Red
Cross officials said, had to be taken away by ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   The sensitivity of the subject was palpable at a news conference
held by investigators in Newport on Tuesday afternoon. Graham said
that the recovery of remains, which had continued throughout the
day, would be done ``with dignity and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were seeking to answer a basic but complex
question: Why did EgyptAir Flight 990, a 10-year-old airplane with
no prior problems, suddenly drop from a clear night sky and fall
33,000 feet into the Atlantic, leaving only teddy bears, shoes and
debris to bob in the fuel-slicked water?
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 767 took off from Kennedy Airport in New York at 1:19
a.m. for a routine 11-hour flight to Cairo. Radar tracks indicate
that 31 minutes later, the twin-engine jet began its inexplicable
two-minute plunge without any reports of problems from its crew.
</P>
<P>
   Now, hundreds of federal investigators, as well as the crews of
Navy and Coast Guard vessels, are working to determine the
tragedy's cause. Officials continue to warn that there is no
evidence of foul play; nevertheless, until a definitive cause is
determined, they said they must investigate the possibilities of
terrorism and other crime.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for the safety board also said they planned either to
send American investigators to Cairo to look at the maintenance
records of the plane or to have those records sent to the United
States. The first group of investigators from Egypt arrived in
Newport on Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   There was no elaboration Tuesday on reports that an EgyptAir 990
crew member had complained that a briefcase had been tampered with
in Los Angeles, where the doomed flight had originated Saturday
evening. But just as that tantalizing tidbit seemed to fade,
another surfaced: James Hall, chairman of the safety board, said
Tuesday night that two people on Nantucket had told investigators
that they witnessed the final plunge of the jet.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators deflected further questions about the witnesses'
claims Tuesday night, so the potential value of those reports could
not be determined. Many people witnessed the mid-air explosion and
crash of TWA Flight 800 in 1996, largely because it occurred close
to sunset and a few miles from the southeastern shores of Long
Island. By comparison, EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed in the middle of
the night, 50 miles from Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   In establishing reasonable lines of inquiry, investigators
clearly plan to examine more closely the problem with the Boeing
767's thrust reverser.
</P>
<P>
   The accidental deployment of a thrust reverser in midflight led
to the crash of another Boeing 767, operated by Lauda Air, near
Bangkok, Thailand, in May 1991; the 233 people on board were
killed.

<P>
   Thrust reversers also played a role in a frightening incident
involving an EgyptAir 767, when a portion of a thrust reverser's
sleeve tore away in flight and damaged part of a wing. The jet
nevertheless managed to land safely.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing officials maintained that thrust reversers differ by
engine, and that the 1997 incident involved a Pratt and Whitney
engine different from the one installed in EgyptAir Flight 990.
They also pointed out that operators of 767s had made recommended
changes to the thrust reversers after the 1991 crash in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, federal investigators pulled back Tuesday from their
reports Monday that the Coast Guard cutter Juniper had recovered a
``piece of the aircraft structure'' so large that a crane was
needed to hoist it aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard Capt. Russ Webster clarified the discovery at
Tuesday's press conference. He said that the piece of debris was
actually a luggage container. In addition, he said that the item
had not been recovered; it sank before Juniper's crew could salvage
it.
</P>
<P>
   The minor embarrassment had little to do with the definitive
location of the two black boxes. The cockpit voice recorder would
include a tape of the last 30 minutes of conversations by the
aircraft's pilots. But it is the flight data recorder that may
provide the most valuable information regarding the plane's final
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The airplane's flight data recorder, which EgyptAir officials
described as among the most sophisticated of its kind, contains
most of the airplane's technical data _ from the positioning of its
various parts to its speed and direction.
</P>
<P>
   Federal aviation investigators have a good record of recovering
black boxes like these. Recovered black boxes can often circumvent
the need to salvage and reconstruct entire jets.
</P>
<P>
   For all the technological advancements being brought to bear in
the investigation, a mundane low-pressure storm will keep secret
whatever revelations the black boxes contain _ at least for the
next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Graham of the Navy said Tuesday night that forecasts called for
continuous storms that would churn the seas with 20-foot waves,
creating conditions unsafe for even the most seasoned of seafarers.
</P>
<P>
   All vessels involved in the salvage operation _ except one Coast
Guard cutter _ have returned to what he called ``safe harbor.'' And
if the commander of that Coast Guard vessel deems it necessary, his
ship will also return to shore.

had campaigned for the changes as a referendum on his policies. The
vote was a victory for Public Advocate Mark Green and other
Democratic politicians, who had criticized the revisions as a
mayoral power grab.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor picked this fight, and now lost this fight,'' Green
said Tuesday night at a celebration at the Two Boots restaurant in
the East Village. ``Although City Hall outspent our grass roots
coalition 10 to 1, our effort won by 3 to 1 because New Yorkers
know a scam when they see one.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani conceded late Tuesday night that he should not have
promoted such changes this year, and urged the City Council to pass
legislation reflecting the goals of many of the charter proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake in presenting charter revision this year,''
Giuliani said in a news conference at the St. Regis Hotel. ``The
vote against it makes it clear that it was a mistake, and I accept
responsibility for it and certainly respect the views of the
voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani had been expected to use a charter victory as evidence
of voter support for his programs in the 2000 Senate race as a
likely opponent to Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, who had campaigned against
the charter revisions, said the results were ``sweeter than any
personal victory I've ever had'' and that it proved ``that you can
never underestimate the intelligence of the voters.'' Voters
understood, he said, that the mayor ``was using the charter
revision for political purposes, as a weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   With 100 per cent of unofficial returns tallied by 11:20 p.m.,
the vote was 76 percent to 24 percent against charter revision, or
281,265 people opposed and 90,838 in favor.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Elections reported that 11 per cent of the city's
3.4 million registered voters turned out on a rainy, blustery day
in an off-election year with few major races at stake.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the charter revision said they believed that
voters turned out in relatively high numbers on the Upper East Side
and Upper West Side of Manhattan, in the Park Slope section of
Brooklyn and in Brooklyn Heights _ heavily Democratic areas
targeted by charter revision opponents. Critics of the changes had
predicted that a low overall turnout would help their side, and
argued that only people who were strongly against the charter
changes would make the effort to vote.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The most important changes would have required a two-thirds vote
of the City Council to approve any tax increases and would have
imposed a cap on city spending tied to the rate of inflation.
Giuliani said the changes were necessary because, in essence, he
could trust no future mayor with the fiscal discipline he said he
has imposed on the city. Therefore, he said, he had to create a
``shadow'' of himself.
</P>
<P>
   Critics countered that Giuliani was behaving like a despot, and
that he was trying to seize control of city spending. Critics also
said the proposals would make it so difficult to raise taxes that
future City Councils might be forced to increase property taxes
instead, which would have been exempt from the two-thirds rule
under the charter changes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most politically popular proposals was a requirement
for gun-free zones around city schools, the first of the 14
revisions listed altogether on the ballot as Proposition 2, which
voters had to vote for or against as an entire package. Critics
said such changes should have been more properly enacted through
the normal legislative channels of the City Council, and not by
changing the city's basic governing document.
</P>
<P>
   Both the mayor and the Democrats had campaigned extensively for
and against charter revision in the week prior to the election,
provoking criticism from good-government groups who said both sides
were stepping over a legal line. Under state law, taxpayer-funded
entities, like the mayor's office and the City Council, may
``educate'' but not ``advocate'' about the contents and
consequences of ballot questions. Although neither side explicitly
said ``vote for'' or ``vote against'' in a series of mailings to
voters, critics said the views were implicit.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Charter Revision Commission also spent taxpayer money on
television cable commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a pretty shabby week in New York politics,''
said Conn Nugent, the executive director of Citizens Union, a civic
group. Nugent said that the mayor and Randy Mastro, the
commission's chairman and a former deputy mayor under Giuliani, had
gone farther over the line than the opposition, and had spent what
he estimated to be a minimum of $1 million of taxpayer money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys are getting away with murder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's political action committee, Solutions America, also
paid for radio commercials and pre-recorded phone calls from
Giuliani that did urge people to vote yes, as is allowed with
private funds. The calls from Giuliani had startled many voters,
and opponents said Tuesday night that they may have backfired.

 NEW YORK: have backfired.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although voters seemed to see the proposed charter revision as a
deeply uninteresting government debate, the changes were in fact
born out of a political feud between Giuliani and one of his most
nettlesome tormentors, Green, that has rarely been dull. When the
mayor announced the creation of a Charter Revision Commission in
June, for example, he did not even bother to deny that a primary
motivation was to block the liberal Green from succeeding him as
mayor _ a nightmare scenario, in Giuliani's eyes, that would take
the city back to the days of high taxes, rampant crime and a
politician unable to say no to special interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Under the original proposals, the commission would have required
a special election within 60 days if the mayor leaves office early,
as could happen if Giuliani is elected to the Senate in 2000 with a
year left in his mayoral term. Under the charter's current
provisions, the public advocate automatically finishes the term of
any mayor who leaves office early.
</P>
<P>
   Critics immediately attacked the special election proposal as a
vendetta by Giuliani against Green, who by the nature of his job
and his temperament has aggravated the mayor since since both men
took office in 1994. Mastro eventually retreated under the
assaults, and in September announced that the commission would
delay the special election provision until 2002, when both Green
and Giuliani are out of office.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Without an impending confrontation between two contentious
political personalities, both Giuliani and Green seemed to lose
interest in the proposed changes. As recently as three weeks before
the election, the most striking thing about each side was its
silence, although both said they were reserving their money for
public educations campaigns just prior to the election.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, Giuliani finally made a speech strongly urging
voters to support the charter changes. Meanwhile a coalition of
labor groups and Vote No on Charter Inc., an advocacy group led by
Richard Schrader, who is on leave as Green's chief of public
affairs, had been busy canvassing, sending out mailings and
operating phone banks.

FDA LEVIES $100 MILLION FINE ON ABBOTT LABORATORIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to add two sentences to 4th graf and one to 5th graf.)  (sw) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Abbott Laboratories, the nation's largest maker of
medical diagnostic tests, agreed on Tuesday to pay $100 million to
settle accusations that the company failed to meet federal quality
standards when it made hundreds of varieties of medical test kits.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the
manufacture and sale of medical devices, said it was the largest
fine ever levied by the agency. Under a consent decree approved by
a federal judge on Tuesday in Chicago, Abbott Laboratories agreed
to change its practices over the next year and to discontinue the
manufacture or distribution of many of the test kits that were
developed using what the FDA called a ``faulty manufacturing
process.''
</P>
<P>
   The process at issue, which is mostly chemical, is used to
create more than 300 kits that can be used to evaluate blood and
urine samples and offer diagnoses to treat a multitude of other
ailments, from cancer and thyroid complications to hepatitis and
cardiovascular problems. The company denied on Tuesday that any of
the kits are faulty.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA has not recalled any of the test kits, but the
inventories of more than 100 different products will be destroyed.
An additional 175 test kits that are considered ``medically
necessary,'' often because they are the sole test kit on the
market, will continue to be sold to hospitals and laboratories even
as the company develops a better process. Those include tests that
detect the AIDS virus and Hepatitis in donated blood. The agency
found no evidence that those particular tests were inaccurate. As
an added safeguard, the FDA reinspects blood before deciding which
batches can be transfused.
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials said they did not have any evidence that consumers
had been harmed by errors tied to the test kits, but the agency
feared that the manufacturing process was so deficient as to raise
doubts about their effectiveness and pose the risk of creating test
kits that could result in faulty or erroneous diagnoses. Patients
who had their blood or other tissue samples tested at a laboratory
using Abbott products are not advised to be retested, the FDA said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said it took its action on Tuesday after more than
six years of prodding Abbott executives to improve manufacturing
processes in its medical diagnostics division to meet federal
standards. Agency officials said that Abbott officials had tinkered
with the processes but had failed to adequately correct the
deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past six years we have been inspecting and leaving
them letters, and we have not been successful with that,'' said Dr.
Jane Henney, commissioner of food and drugs at the FDA. ``We don't
know of any actual patient harm, but we are looking at processes
that don't give us the level of assurance we need.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Abbott Laboratories said that by signing the
consent decree, it was not admitting to violating any federal
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokeswoman for Abbott Laboratories, which is based in
Abbott Park, Ill., said the company was taking the FDA concerns
seriously and would try to improve the manufacturing process at its
plants in Lake County, Ill., where all of the processes in question
are.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have invested significantly in this, and we feel we've made
progress,'' said Rhonda Luniak, a spokeswoman at the company, which
had revenue of more than $12.4 billion in 1998. ``But the FDA
believes we have not progressed. We need to do it, and we need to
do it fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Company officials insisted it was not the test kits or even
diagnostic equipments that were the problem but the manufacturing
process behind the test kits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consent decree said nothing about the efficiency of the
test kits,'' Ms. Luniak said. ``The products that are out there
continue to provide accurate results. What's at issue here is the
manufacturing process.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott officials also said they were pleased that in taking its
action, the FDA allowed the company to resolve the issue without
disruption to patient care.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott Laboratories will continue to make medical test kits _
some largely chemical formulas that interact with fluid samples _
that diagnose hepatitis, retrovirus, cardiovascular disease,
cancer, thyroid disorders, fertility, drug monitoring and
congenital and respiratory conditions. In many of these areas, few
alternative products exist, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are allowing them to remain in the market where this is the
sole product,'' Dr. Henney said in a telephone interview. ``They
are the only diagnostic kit to test certain things.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 other test kits, however, will be destroyed in
inventory and discontinued on the market, largely because there are
alternatives. Those products account for about $250 million a year
in sales for Abbott Laboratories. The company's diagnostics
division had sales of about $2.8 billion a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the FDA's action, Abbott officials said on
Tuesday that the company had taken a $168 million charge and
restated its third-quarter earnings to 30 cents a share from a
previously reported 38 cents. The company said that earnings could
be lowered by as much as 2 cents a share for the fourth quarter and
by as much as 10 cents a share for 2000. Analysts had expected
Abbott to earn 45 cents a share in the fourth quarter and $1.86 a
share for 2000, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Abbott Laboratories fell $2.3125 on Tuesday, to $38.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA said it first discovered problems at Abbott's
manufacturing plants in 1993. In subsequent inspections over the
years, the FDA continued to find violations of its quality
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Under the consent decree, Abbott Laboratories is obligated to
submit to the agency a ``master compliance'' program and resolve
the problems within one year or face large fines.

GUARD UDIT FINDS NO ROSTER PADDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An audit of Arizona National Guard discharge records has turned
up no ``ghost'' soldiers, as alleged by a couple of watchdog
groups, Army Inspector General Frank Taddonio said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Fraud Prevention Council and a Hispanic guardsmen's group
known as OMEGA complained this summer that thousands of discharges
were unreported in an attempt to keep inflated amounts of federal
revenue flowing to Arizona Guard units.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Tribune'' reported that more than 100 discharge
applications were delayed six months to two years. But Taddonio, a
colonel, said he found nothing improper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reviewed the last three years' worth of discharges,'' he
said. ``I did a complete audit trail. The allegations are
unsubstantiated.''
</P>
<P>
   Reuben Noel, director of the Fraud Prevention Council, a local
group formed in 1998, accused the inspector general of covering up
for Arizona National Guard Adjutant General David Rataczak, who
requested the audit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of a massive cover-up,'' Noel said. ``He still
hasn't touched on the fraud or the racial discrimination or the
preferential treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom McNelley, resident agent in charge of the Defense
Department's Criminal Investigative Service, said his agency is
looking into charges of roster padding, payment of life insurance
benefits to survivors of guardsmen who were discharged and
financial abuses in construction.
</P>
<P>
   Noel said witnesses also are telling McNelley about sexual
harassment and abuse, and about discrimination in Guard promotions
and assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Senate President Brenda Burns, R-Glendale, said she will
await a full briefing on the inspector general's report before
deciding on a request for investigations by the Legislature and its
auditor general.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Freestone, R-Mesa, had asked Burns to name a special
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had numerous people call, as high as lieutenant
colonels, who say this is the tip of the iceberg,'' Freestone said.
``I'm interested in the ghost rolls because that could cost us our
National Guard in Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Smith, R-east Phoenix, said the Army inspector
general's report shows no need for any probe by the Legislature or
by the state auditor general.
</P>
<P>
   ``The personnel charges of discrimination are real old,'' Smith
said. ``The facts are not available.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the inspector general found some discharges that took
up to a year to process, ``but the Army said Arizona's processing
record is one of the best in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Taddonio said he reviewed a random 10 percent sample of Arizona
discharges with the National Guard Bureau and Department of the
Army in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state is well within the standard (for processing),'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although processing of some discharges was delayed, all those
reviewed were prompt and efficient, Taddonio said. Delays can stem
from attempts to retain guardsmen who want out or appeals from
guardsmen being fired.
</P>
<P>
   Smith emphasized that federal funds for the Arizona National
Guard are not based on troop strength. Guardsmen receive paychecks
based on the days they report for drill.
</P>
<P>
   But Freestone said Guard units and supporting funds could be
reassigned from Arizona if they were based on inflated troop
counts. &QL;

DEMOCRATS TRIM GOP'S MAJORITY IN N.J. STATE ASSEMBLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Democrats picked up three seats in elections for
New Jersey's 80 state Assembly districts Tuesday, narrowing the
Republicans' majority in the lower house of the Legislature to
45-to-35.
</P>
<P>
   In an off-year election that set records for high campaign
spending and low voter turnout, Democratic challengers picked up at
least one of the two seats in the 4th District in Camden and
Gloucester counties. Republican incumbent Gerald Luongo, who has
faced criticism over involvement in a questionable land deal,
appeared headed to defeat. His running mate, the incumbent George
Geist, won re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also picked up two seats in Mercer County, where
Assembly candidates rode the reverse coattails of Glen Gilmore, a
Democrat who won the mayor's race in Hamilton Township.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican incumbents fended off challenges in several
fiercely contested races, where Democrats unsuccessfully sought to
make gun control and health insurance the crucial issues.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic challenger, Edward Werner, whose 7-year-old son was
the victim in a sensational murder case, failed to unseat either
Republican _ Joseph Malone or Melvin Cottrell _ in the 30th
District in Burlington and Ocean counties.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Majority Leader Charles DiGaetano, who set a state
fund-raising record by collecting more than $700,000 for his race,
also survived a challenge for his seat in Bergen, Essex and Passaic
counties.
</P>
<P>
   Republican party leaders hailed the results as an endorsement of
their leadership since seizing the Assembly majority in 1991.
Republicans outspent Democrats two-to-one, according to records
filed in the Election Law Enforcement Commission, and in the weeks
before the election some Republicans had predicted that the party's
candidates might retain all 48 of their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman said that although Democrats did pick up
three seats, Republicans still fared far better than majority
parties in previous midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given what has happened in the past during off-year elections
in a governor's second term, we did pretty well,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said the results would do little to shift the
balance of power in the state capital, where both Assembly Speaker
Jack Collins and Senate President Donald DiFrancesco are believed
to be interested in running for governor in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means pretty much status quo politics, no change in
power,'' said Cliff Zukin, a political science professor at Rutgers
university. ``The seats which changed hands were largely decided on
local issues. Incumbents won and incumbents should win when the
economy is good, there's no grass roots anger and incumbents raise
a boatload more money than do challengers.''
</P>
<P>
   With no statewide or national offices at the top of the ballot,
and New Jersey enjoying a strong economy and a drop in crime rates,
many experts predicted voter turnout would break the record low of
35 percent, set the last time Assembly races led the ballot, in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   But despite tepid interest, fund raising and spending for this
year's campaigns was expected to surpass the record of $12 million
set in 1995, according to the director of the state's Election Law
Enforcement Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had hoped to make the election a referendum on gun
control and health care. Many public opinion polls show that New
Jersey's historically cantankerous voters feel uneasy about gun
safety, public education and the restrictions by health insurance
companies and health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In many races, Democrats blasted Republicans for blocking a bill
to make New Jersey the first state to require that all handguns
have ``smart gun'' technology _ devices that prevent them from
firing for anyone but their owners. ``Republicans try to talk about
how rosy things are, but just beneath the surface, people are
concerned about their futures, and whether their children are going
to be safe in school,'' said Julie Roginsky, campaign director for
the Assembly Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans countered by pointing out that Collins had led
the successful fight for a bill requiring trigger locks on all guns
sold in the state. Republicans also won approval of a bill to set
aside $1 million to finance research and development of smart-gun
technology. Republicans also pointed out that Democratic
legislators and former Gov. Jim Florio, who is running for U.S.
Senate, raised taxes by $2.8 billion when they controlled Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under Republican leadership, the Assembly has controlled
spending, cut taxes, unemployment is in an all-time low, and I
haven't heard of anyone returning their property tax rebate checks
to the Treasury,'' said Chuck Haytaian, Republican state party
chairman. ``When you compare it to 1991, when the Democrats lost
favor, unemployment was in double digits and there had been a $2.8
billion tax increase, today is a good day to be an incumbent.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, before the night was over, the attention of many elected
officials had already turned to next November's race to fill the
U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Frank Lautenberg, a Democrat. In
recent days, two Republican candidates have announced plans to form
exploratory committees for the Senate race: state Sen. William
Gormley and Lewis Eisenberg, chairman of the Port Authority of New
York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic Senate candidate, Jon Corzine, a former co-chairman
of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., also won endorsements, one from Hudson
County Executive Robert Janiszewski, who easily won re-election
Tuesday. Also, Rep. Robert Menendez, a Democrat who was once
considered a likely candidate for Lautenberg's seat, announced
Tuesday that he would hold a news conference in Washington on
Wednesday to endorse Corzine in his primary battle against Florio
and a former state party chairman, Tom Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   ``I waited until after the Assembly elections because I didn't
want to detract from the attention from races we were trying so
hard to generate attention for,'' Menendez said.
</P>
<P>
   In other election results, about 65 percent of voters approved a
referendum to issue $500 million in bonds to rebuild some roads and
bridges on state and county roads.
</P>
<P>
   Newark Mayor Sharpe James also helped Democrats retain the only
State Senate seat being contested this year, by handily defeating
his Republican challenger in a race for the seat vacated when Sen.
Wynona Lipman died in May. James won the right to serve the final
year of her term, and will have to run for re-election in 2001.

TORONTO RAPTURE FOR CELTICS ON OPENING NIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 BKN-CELTICS-RAPTORS-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By PETER MAY 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The boos started early in the fourth quarter. The mass
exodus came a few minutes later. The players themselves were
sniping at each other throughout what had to be an utterly
humiliating evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Raptors clearly are hoping for big things this
season, but Tuesday night, they ran head-first into what Rick
Pitino can only hope is a sign of things to come. His Celtics
opened the 1999-2000 season in spectacular fashion with a
convincing, authoritative, 103-90 victory over the supposedly
up-and-coming Raptors. It wasn't even that close.
</P>
<P>
   There's no way to understate it: The Celtics were terrific from
start to finish, with many hands stirring the pot. It was as if all
the players jumped off the coach's clipboard. Paul Pierce silenced
the Vince Carter fans with a 30-point outburst, 20 coming in the
first half. (Carter finished with 12.) Antoine Walker added 22,
Walter McCarty 20 (on six treys), and nerveless rookie Adrian
Griffin, in his first pro start, contributed 14 points and a
team-high 7 assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a game we'd been gunning for,'' said an elated
Pitino, who added that he did not see it as payback for last year's
humbling opening loss to Toronto at the FleetCenter. ``We want to
showcase an attitude of unselfishness at the offensive and
defensive ends. Our guys did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they did. They held Toronto, the fifth-best shooting team
in the NBA in the exhibition season, to 44 percent. They
outrebounded the ostensibly bigger, stronger, meaner Raptors,
limiting Charles Oakley and Antonio Davis to 8 rebounds between
them. They never even once resorted to their full-court press; it
wasn't necessary. They shot 52 percent, a figure boosted by an
astounding 10 of 13 from international waters.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, we would be remiss if we omitted other signs
from the hoop god that this night was theirs: a banked free throw
from Wayne Turner, the six McCarty treys (he had only 13 all last
year), and the stunning sight of Pervis Ellison putting the ball on
the floor and driving the lane for a finger roll past equally
stunned Raptor defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did get caught up in the Opening Night thing a bit,'' said
Ellison, who had not played since March 1998. ``I mean, the
excitement. The light shows. I haven't seen those in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino shook his head and couldn't suppress a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pervis,'' he said, ``gave us some good minutes. He made some
big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone did. The Celtics never trailed, and there was but a
single tie, 2-2. Griffin and Pierce (12 of 19) collaborated on a
10-2 run to make it 12-4 and that, folks, was exactly how the rest
of the night went.
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors came close a couple of times, getting within 3
points in the second and 4 in third. In the first instance, the
Celtics countered with an 11-2 run. In the second, it was a 7-0
burst. The checkpoint leads were 9, 8, and 14. Toronto never got
closer than the final 13-point margin in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   This was clearly a huge downer for a team with high hopes. Butch
Carter, the Toronto coach, had been wary of this game and talked
incessantly about not taking the Celtics lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were just words,'' the coach said. ``They did to us what
we did to them last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics played with a sense of purpose while Toronto played
with a sense of entitlement. Maybe the Raptors were overwhelmed by
their own sense of self-importance or by the prognostications of
success. It was clear at the start, in the middle, and in the end
which team was ready to play and which one was still reading its
press clippings.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy McGrady was upset that he didn't start.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably frustrated, and that's natural for a
20-year-old,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   There was visible on-court sniping among the Raptors, which even
Walker, a provocateur in his own right, couldn't miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like they're trying to get their chemistry
together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That was supposed to be the problem with Boston. That has been
the problem with Boston. That was not the problem Tuesday night.
There were no problems.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest game the Celtics play this season is Wednesday
night, their home opener against the Wizards, for it's going to be
hard to duplicate, let alone better, their debut. No one knows
whether this was a precursor, an aberration, a fraudulent opponent,
or an on-again, off-again thing.
</P>
<P>
   But for one night, on the road, against a team that thinks very
big thoughts, the Celtics had every answer. They played like the
team that's going somewhere.

   We seem to have kicked up a bit of a dust storm with our
editorial on Sunday titled ``McCain's temper is legitimate issue:
Hull's account of outbursts not unusual.'' It's been the topic of
national television and print news accounts for several days now.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the networks' new focus on what most Arizonans
consider to be an old issue has been riddled with inaccuracies and
misinformation. Let's set the record straight.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his band of backers have sought to spin this
editorial as evidence of a ``grudge match'' this paper has with the
senator. Several in the national media have jumped on board,
portraying the editorial as part of a ``vendetta'' against McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Vendetta?
</P>
<P>
   McCain has run for office five times since he moved to Arizona.
This newspaper has endorsed his candidacy all five times, most
recently just a year ago, shortly after I became editor of these
pages. McCain sat down with editorial board members and his
Democratic opponent for nearly two hours to discuss key issues in
the race and our questions about the candidates' positions on them.
At the conclusion of the meeting, McCain thanked us for the
``fairness'' we accorded him. Two of his staffers later caught up
to me to convey precisely the same message.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, we've applauded McCain on these pages many times over
the years, including just last week for his role in seeking an
amendment to legislation having to do with quiet aircraft over the
Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   We supported McCain's efforts to open several major airports to
certain long-distance flights and to deregulate certain aspects of
the telecommunications industry. We've backed McCain's bold and
dignified leadership on re-establishing relations with Vietnam,
made all the more poignant by McCain's personal experiences as a
prisoner of war. We've commended his strong and knowledgeable
leadership on many national defense issues, most recently during
the Kosovo upheaval. We've lauded McCain's stances against
congressional pork and embraced portions of his call for campaign
reform.
</P>
<P>
   This newspaper published an exceptionally evenhanded 16-page
special section on McCain just last month titled ``The Life Story
of Arizona's Maverick Senator'' that provoked not a peep of peeve
from the McCain camp. Heck, we even sported a front-page feature
last June on McCain's spunky mom _ a piece McCain critics blasted
as a puffery designed to promote the candidacy of the hometown
candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   Vendetta? Right, and the Grand Canyon is in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, we've also been critical of McCain. We criticized his role
in the Keating Five scandal, in which McCain was cited by the
Senate Ethics Committee for exercising ``poor judgment.'' And we
chastised his handling of the announcement of his wife's drug
addiction _ a problem that McCain acknowledged he didn't know about
until after Cindy McCain kicked the habit. (Cindy McCain's
admission that she stole painkillers from her own charity to
support her habit was the subject of a hard-hitting but hardly
unfair cartoon on these pages, so enraging McCain that it was years
before he returned phone calls from ``Republic'' staffers.) We've
banged on him more recently for a tasteless joke about Chelsea
Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we've been critical of McCain's volatility and his public
belittling of people with whom he disagrees _ whether they are
former Gov. Rose Mofford at a hearing in Washington, the Jewish man
he lambasted for objecting to McCain's speech referring to
``Christian'' compassion for the homeless, or a public reference to
the Leisure World retirement community as ``Seizure World.'' If
McCain comes unglued over this sort of local scrutiny, what can we
expect once the national scrutiny kicks in?
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his backers also have sought to paint Sunday's
editorial as part of an orchestrated campaign by Texas Gov. George
W. Bush to undermine McCain's campaign for president. Again,
patently untrue. Here are the facts:
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the ``New York Times'' published a front-page story
about McCain's testy relations with Arizona Gov. Jane Hull, the
state's other top Republican officeholder, who described McCain's
difficulty in controlling his temper. It was followed by a critical
column by a member of the ``Wall Street Journa''l's editorial
board. In those pieces, McCain pleaded guilty to passion but
insisted he doesn't ``insult anybody or fly off the handle or
anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a debate about the virtues of passion. There are
many. This was an editorial correcting a statement McCain made
about his own conduct in those national pieces, a statement that
many in Arizona who have worked with him over the past 17 years
know to be simply untrue. We at ``The Republic'' may be
old-fashioned, but we believe that, as the major newspaper that
probably knows McCain best, we have an obligation to set the record
straight and provide as full and complete a picture of John McCain
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is McCain has ``insulted'' people and ``flown off the
handle.''
</P>
<P>
   To portray responsible journalism as puppetry to a rival
candidate is yet another example of the unfounded, sarcastic and
condescending charges to which McCain, unfortunately, is prone.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. McCain is alleging that the ``New York Times''
news pages, the ``Wall Street Journa''l's editorial pages (we all
know how close those two are), ``The Arizona Republic,'' Gov. Hull
and just about anybody else who criticizes him all take their
marching orders from the governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   That's absurd.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, the national discussion of all this so far has been
exceedingly disappointing. It's been characterized by half-truths
and untruths.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about passion, vendettas or candidate manipulation.
It's about character _ the issue around which McCain himself has
wrapped his campaign. It shouldn't come as a surprise that there
are more faces to McCain's character than the simplistic one he and
his backers are working so hard to put forward. &QL;

NEW GM GILLICK HAS WORK CUT OUT IN GRIFFEY TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When the Mariners hired Pat Gillick as their general
manager last week, they still believed they could re-sign center
fielder Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   But there was always the possibility that Griffey would request
a trade, and now that he has, the Mariners will put Gillick's
experience to use immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody can get the most value for Ken Griffey Jr., it's
Pat Gillick,'' said Mariners chairman Howard Lincoln. ``I'm very
confident. But it's going to take some time.''
</P>
<P>
   One superstar whose contract expires next season, Texas
outfielder Juan Gonzalez, was traded to Detroit Tuesday in a deal
that landed a solid starting pitcher and two top prospects for the
Rangers. That should give Gillick confidence as he sorts through
his voice mails and initiates trade talks at this weekend's general
managers meetings in Laguna Niguel, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey is one of several stars who could be moved this winter.
Other players whose contracts expire after 2000 include the
Mariners' Alex Rodriguez, Toronto's Carlos Delgado and Shawn Green,
Cleveland's Manny Ramirez and Atlanta's Chipper Jones. Of that
group, Griffey is the only one who controls his destination because
he has 10 years of major league service and the last five with the
same team.
</P>
<P>
   That means Griffey can determine where the Mariners trade him.
Sources said Tuesday that his list is not narrow, and could include
about 10 teams, presumably all of which have spring training in
Florida, Griffey's home state.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed Griffey can veto any deal for any reason, and he
has stated that he would not want to go to a team he believed was
giving up too much to get him. While not giving specifics Tuesday,
Griffey's agent, Brian Goldberg, said, ``I don't expect that to be
an issue at all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing Junior and I are adamant about is allowing the
Mariners to make the best deal they can,'' Goldberg said. ``They've
been great to him and we've had a great relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillick said Tuesday he had little interest in trading for a
player with one year left on his contract, like Green, Ramirez and
the others. He said he believed he could possibly get four quality
players for Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to obtain players we think can help us win in
2000, but we have to look a little bit further ahead than 2000,''
Gillick said. ``In a package for Kenny, we're looking for a mix of
players that would help us for the future as well as now.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's depature leaves the Mariners with no everyday
outfielders who are certain to come back. Brian Hunter led the
American League in stolen bases, but his problems getting on base
make his return questionable. The M's seem intent on bringing back
Jay Buhner, but he has not played a full season since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Gillick said outfielders will be a priority, particularly
left-handed hitters. The team continues to seek a first baseman,
leadoff hitter and bullpen help, he said, and those are areas the
M's will ``concentrate on'' in Griffey trade talks.
</P>
<P>
   But getting the best deal naturally hinges on whether Griffey
will sign an extension with his new team. If a team traded for
Griffey knowing it could keep him past 2000, the offer would
obviously be better. A source said Tuesday that Griffey intends to
play out the year and determine if the new team is a good fit
before signing. Gillick said that issue never came up at Monday's
meeting in Orlando, when Griffey asked to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll let Pat see what he comes up with,'' said Mariners
president Chuck Armstrong, ``but I would expect that we would not
allow any other team to have advance contract discussions with
Ken.''
</P>
<P>
   There is at least one team that fits Griffey's wishes so neatly
that it knows it almost certainly could sign him long-term. That
team is the Atlanta Braves, a perennial winner that trains near
Griffey's home in Orlando, and is close enough to Orlando that
Griffey could fly there on off days.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves could offer a package including center fielder Andruw
Jones, left field prospect George Lombard and any number of
pitchers, from a young starter (Kevin Millwood) to a veteran
starter (Tom Glavine or John Smoltz) or other young pitchers like
Bruce Chen or Kevin McGlinchy.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners scouted the Braves in September, though the Braves
showed only lukewarm interest in Griffey during preliminary trade
talks at the time. But the prospect of Griffey chasing Hank Aaron's
home run record in a Braves uniform _ and playing on TBS, no less _
could entice owner Ted Turner.
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Reds, whose bench coach is Ken Griffey Sr. and
who have configured their future ballpark with a short right field
porch, will make an effort, general manager Jim Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already got a call into Pat Gillick to say we're in,''
said Bowden, who admitted his middle-market club was a long shot to
land Griffey. ``How am I going to know unless I have discussions?
But I am going to play. Ken Griffey Jr. is the best position player
in baseball, and he's from Cincinnati. So it's a marriage made in
heaven. But there are also going to be 28 other teams trying to get
him. I can't make any promises, because they're obviously going to
want a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Reds manager Jack McKeon was less optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how we'd do it,'' he said. ``We'd have to trade
the whole ballclub. Sure, you'd love to have him, but they'd want
the nucleus of what we've got.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians have long been rumored as a possible
destination for both Griffey and Rodriguez, with shortstop Omar
Vizquel, outfielder Richie Sexson, pitcher Jaret Wright and Ramirez
often mentioned as trade bait. But the Indians need pitching, not
offense, and are expected to direct their resources toward a trade
for San Diego starter Andy Ashby.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Red Sox have a deep minor league system and need a
center fielder, and the Baltimore Orioles always come up when
expensive players are available. But the Orioles have almost
nothing to trade besides outfielder and albatross Albert Belle.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Astros train in Kissimmee, Fla., near Orlando, and
Griffey has named them as a team he would consider going to.
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa Bay Devil Rays are the closest team to Orlando, and
Griffey's presence could solve their chronic attendance problems
and effectively move them up in market class. But Tampa Bay, an
expansion team two years ago, has little to offer.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Cubs could have interest in adding Griffey to an
outfield that already has Sammy Sosa, but it is doubtful Griffey
would approve a trade to a team that trains in Arizona. Besides the
Cubs and Mariners, teams training in Arizona include the White Sox,
Colorado, Arizona, Anaheim, Milwaukee, Oakland, San Francisco and
San Diego. All other teams train in Florida.

   The Phoenix Coyotes have landed the biggest victory in their
Valley history thanks to an assist from voters in three
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in Scottsdale, Fountain Hills and Guadalupe decided to
rebuild Scottsdale's decaying Los Arcos Mall and move the Coyotes
to their own arena from their leased home in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The publicly backed, $535 million redevelopment plan includes a
National Hockey League arena, shops and restaurants at Scottsdale
and McDowell roads.
</P>
<P>
   With 52 percent of voters casting ballots before Election Day,
58 percent of Scottsdale voters supported the project and 42
percent opposed it. In Fountain Hills, 65 percent voted in favor
and 35 percent said no. Guadalupe voters supported the measure 81
to 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Project backers, who campaigned hard in all three cities,
targeted early voters with mailings, phone calls and reminders.
</P>
<P>
   The two smaller cities have been promised $1 million each by the
developers and the Coyotes for their support of the project, which
will be built with at least $200 million in public subsidies, half
of it from Scottsdale, but none of it new taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, Scottsdale, Guadalupe and Fountain Hills,'' Coyotes
President Shawn Hunter exalted at a victory gathering at Los Arcos
Mall. ``We're going to do this right and make you proud.''
</P>
<P>
   About 300 Coyotes fans and executives gathered at the mall with
officials from the Ellman Cos., the project developer, for a lively
victory celebration accented by rock and roll music and plenty of
back slapping.
</P>
<P>
   ``The capital they'll be able to make _ from personal seat
licenses, luxury boxes, all of it _ means they'll be able to sign
bigger players and go after free agents,'' said Max Stinnett, 24,
of Phoenix, one of the fans at the Los Arcos celebration. ``This is
huge.''
</P>
<P>
   About an hour after the polls closed at 7 p.m., about a dozen of
the key supporters huddled in the campaign office and waited for
the final numbers. After 15 minutes, they emerged and held up
yellow placards that read ``YES,'' thrilling supporters, who
erupted in hooting and hollering worthy of a hockey playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's stop talking politics and build this,'' said Ellman
Senior Vice President Bob Kaufman, who labored almost a year on the
campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout in Scottsdale was 39 percent compared with 27 percent in
the Sept. 7 election, which saw the defeat of the Canals of
Scottsdale, a more ambitious redevelopment plan for downtown
Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Those filing into polls Tuesday from Scottsdale's northern
reaches to the shadow of Los Arcos Mall uniformly said the Los
Arcos area in south Scottsdale, at the confluence of two freeways
and two major streets, needs new life.
</P>
<P>
   They think an 18,000-seat hockey arena, movie complex and shops
and restaurants is the answer to reviving a spot that thrived as a
mall when it opened 30 years ago, but fell victim to competition
from newer, trendy malls and now has only four open businesses. The
Los Arcos Radio Shack shuttered its doors just this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``That area of town needs a shot in the arm,'' said Mike Frank,
55, a financial manager who lives in north Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Those who voted against the plan Tuesday said they object to
public financing for a private project and worry that it will
destroy one of the city's oldest neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not going to be a cost-free thing for the citizens
of Scottsdale because the taxes that they generate are not going to
go back into the system,'' said Harriet Sharkey-Ingolia, 64, a
retiree.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes say they are losing millions each year by playing in
America West Arena, which was designed for basketball and has
thousands of obstructed view seats when configured for hockey. They
share the arena with the Phoenix Suns basketball team. They plan to
start playing in the new arena when their lease at America West
Arena expires in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The victory enables the developer and the team to use nearly
$100 million in state sales tax income over 10 years to finance
parts of the development. The city is required by state law to
match the state contribution. Other funds will come from the sale
of the naming rights for the arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid of a few dollars in taxes to make Scottsdale
better,'' said voter Terry Francisco, 64, a retired north
Scottsdale resident.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Kauffman, an attorney who led the opponents, said those who
voted in person Tuesday were much more split on the issue than the
early voters. He said his group will continue to monitor the
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not done,'' he said. ``This has to be scrutinized very
carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale City Councilman Robert Pettycrew, who backed the
project, said the city will benefit financially in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters of Scottsdale have seen the need and stepped
forward,'' he said, adding that he understands why many raised
questions about the financing package which won't be completed for
at least two months. ``We've got a lot of work to do to make sure
that those promises are kept.''
</P>
<P>
   But opponents _ who mounted a quiet, grass-roots campaign with a
fraction of the dollars that the backers spent _ called the plan
corporate welfare. RIGHT (Redevelopment Imposes Generally Higher
Taxes), led by north Scottsdale attorney Alan Kaufman, argued that
dollars now flowing into the state's coffers will be redirected to
the developer, causing higher property taxes and other fees.
</P>
<P>
   Foes also filed an unsuccessful, last-minute lawsuit against the
city and the Los Arcos stadium district, saying they misled voters
by failing to divulge the city's match for the project in a
publicity pamphlet sent to voters. Maricopa County Superior Court
Judge Barry Schneider disagreed Thursday, saying the election
covers only the state tax rebate portion of the financing plan. &QL;

CLIPPERS LOSE OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Lamar Odom, who is to Clipper fans as a rescue
plane was to the castaways on ``Gilligan's Island,'' must have felt
marooned Tuesday night in his NBA debut.
</P>
<P>
   Teammate and incumbent go-to guy Maurice Taylor rode the bench
with foul trouble. To make matters even trickier, there were no
picks. No cuts. No appreciable help -- the Clipper offense seemed
as primitive as can be.
</P>
<P>
   But even though Odom won't turn 20 until Saturday, he wasn't too
young to teach the Staples Center crowd (17,874 out of 18,964
seats) a lesson in old-school gamesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie from Rhode Island finished with 30 points and 12
rebounds, leading the Clippers to a ... well, they lost their
season opener, 104-92, to the Seattle SuperSonics. Remember, the
castaways had trouble bringing it home, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonic heroes included Vernon Maxwell, who went for 29 points
off the bench, and All-Star point guard Gary Payton (22 and 13
assists).
</P>
<P>
   Taylor had 14 points and 3 rebounds for the Clippers in 26
minutes before fouling out. Derek Anderson added 19 points and
Tyrone Nesby supplied his typical juice off the bench (16), but
despite moving to a new house, the Clips performed like the same
doormats.
</P>
<P>
   After pyrotechnics, smoke and hackneyed crowing by hired-gun
Michael Buffer, the Clippers cut the ribbon on their home, suite
home by opening an 8-2 lead that included a pair of buckets by
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   But hard-hat offensive rebounding by ex-Laker Ruben Patterson (9
points, 6 rebounds) and a jump hook by forme UCLA Bruin Jelani
McCoy enabled Seattle to build a six-point lead, 23-16 at 1:24 of
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   An offensive rebound and bucket by Odom (4 points, 4 rebounds)
at the buzzer left the Clippers down, 23-20, at the start of round
2.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams were miles from art; the Clippers made just 38
percent of their first-quarter, field-goal attempts, while the
Sonics avoided the nets at a 37-percent clip.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics fixed that by getting to the free-throw line in
period two. Seattle were open for business against the Clippers'
trapping defense, with Maxwell splitting the double team and
drawing fouls. His four free throws and a single by Shammond
Williams at 7:10 left the Clippers down, 39-30, at the end of a 9-0
Seattle run.
</P>
<P>
   An Odom slam off a Taylor feed broke the spell.
</P>
<P>
   Two more freebies by Maxwell put Seattle up, 42-32, before
Taylor scored against a double team.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell continued dash through the Clippers' trap door,
finishing an 18-point second quarter that left Seattle up, 62-48,
at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Odom missed half of a dozen free throws, but still finished the
half with 14 points and 6 rebounds. Taylor had a dozen points and
four fouls.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor began the second half on the bench, while Odom scratched
from 3-point land to cut Seattle's lead to 62-51.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clippers, who found second-quarter gold with Odom
posting up inside, abandoned that tactic in the third period and
fell behind by 18 (69-51) on two free throws by ex-Clipper Brent
Barry at 9:30.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being guarded by the 6-3 Payton, Odom (6-9) still didn't
receive any scripted action on the low post. So he resurrected the
Clipper offense by two buckets on sharp basket cuts and a deep 3
that made it 80-71, Seattle, at 3:27.
</P>
<P>
   A buzzer-beating triple by Rashard Lewis lifted the Sonics to a
88-75 advantage going into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The SuperSonics rolled into town with enough
L.A.-connected personnel to officially qualify for reunion status.
The roll call includes former Clipper Brent Barry, who ranks as one
of the league's foremost club-hoppers after having suited up for
four teams in the last 20 months. As an ex-member of the Sports
Arena's home team, he really appreciates the Clippers' new digs.
``Actually, it's kinda nice,'' he said of the Clips' move to
Staples Center. ``It's exciting for the city; they finally have an
arena that's worthy of the city.'' Other L.A.-connected Sonics
include Coach Paul Westphal (USC), assistant coach Bob Weiss
(former Clipper head coach), Jelani McCoy (UCLA) and Ruben
Patterson (Lakers). ... Taylor admitted that having the burden of
proof in his drive for the league's maximum contract extension
could cause him to try press a bit in the season's first lap.
``Early on, that's going to happen,'' Taylor said. ``Given my
situation, it'll be hard to avoid at first. But I'm not worried
about my productivity. I have a lot of faith in my teammates.''

DEMOCRAT WINS CLOSE RACE FOR MAYOR IN PHILADELPHIA
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Holding off a spirited Republican challenge, the
former City Council president, John F. Street, was elected mayor of
this Democratic bastion on Tuesday, prevailing with a late
electioneering surge that marshaled party faithful from President
Clinton to the ward captains of the city's proud Democratic
machine.
</P>
<P>
   With 93 percent of the vote counted, Street led his Republican
opponent, Sam Katz, 51 percent to 48 percent when Katz finally
conceded.
</P>
<P>
   Street survived a harrowing campaign in which Katz had stripped
him of his front-runner's status in this decidedly Democratic city
and made it a neck-and-neck race to the voting booths.
</P>
<P>
   Street will be the second black mayor in this city's history.
The 56-year-old politician ran on his experience as an accomplished
veteran of 19 years of lawmaking at City Hall and a proven master
in the city's dominant Democratic organization _ a resume that Katz
sought to turn into a net minus.
</P>
<P>
   But Street, pleading openly for a strong loyalist turnout in
this gritty city of 4-to-1 Democratic registration, prevailed in
styling himself as the chief ally of Mayor Edward Rendell, the
popular incumbent. Rendell is finishing eight years with a
reputation for leading the city back from the brink of bankruptcy
and spurring a wave of gleaming downtown renewal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about experience,'' Street said in reaching for the
Rendell mantle. ``It's about proven leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   A Street victory would spare Democrats the ignominy of seeing
Katz, a 49-year-old business consultant, become the city's first
Republican mayor in 52 years, just in time to be reigning next year
when the Republicans will hold their presidential nomination
convention here. Instead, Street will greet the Republican Party as
the battle-scarred champion of this city's resilient Democratic
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond his party's laborious get-out-the-vote drive in the rain
on Tuesday, Street may thank Clinton for his campaign visit here
last week as well as stump appearances by such party stalwarts as
Sen. Edward Kennedy and James Carville, the Democratic campaign
consultant. A Republican victory in this Democratic city would have
been seized upon as a harbinger of the national elections to come
next year when the Republicans will be fighting to regain executive
power in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In this city of 40 percent black residency, race was a dynamic
but not an issue in the struggle between Katz, who is white, and
Street, who is black. Neither party sought a return to the
polarizing politics of a generation ago in the era of Mayor Frank
Rizzo. Both candidates, in fact, promised a joint appearance for
civic unity eventually regardless of the election result.
</P>
<P>
   With strong backing by city unions, Street pressed for above
average turnouts in black neighborhoods. He worked to become the
city's second black mayor, hoping for support approaching the
racially balanced majority that marked the success of the first
black mayor, W. Wilson Goode, in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of a long night, Street's margin of lead stayed
larger than any pre-election poll had anticipated. During the wait
for the result, Rendell, not one to be upstaged as his successor
waited in the wings, let it be known in serial interviews on local
television stations that ``there's a decent likelihood'' he will be
running in the next gubernatorial race, after he serves next year
as the Democratic national chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning as the prime defender of the city's schools, Street
made an issue at every stop of Mr. Katz's qualified endorsement of
private school vouchers as a device, Katz said, to spur education
improvements. The Democrat also scored as irresponsible Katz's call
for a deeper cut in the city's wage tax rate than was enacted under
the Rendell administration.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, in debate after debate, Street delighted in simply
announcing that his opponent was Republican, a fact Katz hardly
advertized. ``He doesn't really want to be a Republican,'' Street
fairly gloated in counting on this city's deep history of party
loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Katz sought to focus on promises of coalition
politics as the best formula for building on the Rendell legacy.
His message underlined the fact that for all the widely hailed
renewal of downtown Philadelphia, residents have been leaving the
city at the rate of more than 15,000 a year for the past decade
because of fears over school quality and street safety in working-
and middle-class neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overlook party lines,'' he pleaded with voters. But not enough
of them did, as Democrats eventually stood by Street.

LAKERS BEAT JAZZ IN OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Like the frozen moment that defined his last
official NBA game, Phil Jackson's coaching career was locked in
freeze-frame until tipoff here Tuesday night, and when the shutter
unclicked, it was clear just how much the scenery around him had
changed.
</P>
<P>
   Where he left on Michael Jordan's awe-inspiring,
championship-clinching jumpshot, Jackson returned on a botched pass
from Glen Rice to Shaquille O'Neal _ the opening sequence of the
Lakers' season opener against the Utah Jazz. Same court, same
opponent, all new challenges for Jackson, not the least of which is
winning without Jordan. Or even his presumed heir, Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Without Bryant, without a legitimate starting power forward, the
Jackson-era Lakers stumbled out of the gate but stayed
step-for-step with their old nemesis and pulled out a dramatic
91-84 victory before 19,911 at the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers had a six-point lead with two minutes to go, but the
Jazz turned to their old standbys to cut the lead. Karl Malone and
John Stockton scored in succession to cut the gap to 84-82 with a
minute left.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Fisher hit a 3-pointer from the right corner to make it
87-82, but it was up to O'Neal to try to seal it. After Stockton's
jumper made it 87-84, O'Neal went to the line for a pair foul
shots. He clanked both, and Greg Ostertag recovered the rebound for
Utah with 19 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jazz's last chance for the win evaporated when Pete
Chilcutt missed a wide-open 3-pointer, and Ron Harper gathered the
rebound with 10.4 seconds left to seal the win.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks leading up to his Lakers debut, Jackson warned
repeatedly that expectations had to be low at the outset. No one
masters the triangle offense overnight, and the Lakers' roster is
in a state of flux, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neal wasn't accepting the presumption his team would
meander to a .500 record in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really thought about it,'' he said before tipoff.
``The 15 games on the schedule I'm looking at, we should come out
on a positive note. We've just got take it one game at a time, one
opponent at a time. ...There's still a couple of those teams there
that no matter how we play them, we still should beat them, period.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've got a couple of good veteran teams (on the
schedule); against teams like that, we just have to do everything
right,'' he said. ``If we do everything right, then I like our
chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, O'Neal overestimated. The Lakers did plenty wrong
Tuesday but still managed to hold a lead over their the Jazz for
most of the game.
</P>
<P>
   That became possible with a resurgent Rice and Rick Fox, a
surprisingly productive John Salley and a surprisingly unproductive
Karl Malone. The NBA's MVP, hampered by a sore back most of the
exhibition season, started slowly and was limited in the first
half. A third-quarter collision with A.C. Green and O'Neal
debilitated Malone further, and through three quarters, he had
posted just 10 points on 2-of-7 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers built a 10-point lead in the third quarter but
entered the fourth holding a tenuous 63-59 edge. Three minutes
later, John Stockton's off-balance jumper gave the Jazz a 67-66
lead, their first lead since early in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Rice and Fox, both ineffective through most of the exhibition
season, rediscovered their jumpshots just in time. Fox scored seven
points in a productive first half, and Rice finished with 28
points.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, it looked like the Lakers would have trouble. Already
woefully undermanned in the frontcourt, they witnessed the one
thing that would make them cringe most: O'Neal in early foul
trouble. He picked up his second and third fouls in rapid
succession with a minute left in the first quarter _ bowling over
Greg Ostertag on offense, then mugging Malone at the other end.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal checked out at that point with a game-high 13 points and
six rebounds, and Salley began what would be a long night of relief
duty. He played seven minutes in the first half and contributed
four points to the Lakers' 43-36 halftime lead.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Riches of talent, Charles Barkley had warned, could go only so far.
Steve Francis, Barkley said, must learn how to play in the NBA. He
would have to slow from 100 mph to a toll-road 75. He would have to
accept that some guys are as gifted as he is.
<TEXT>
<P>
   When all that fails _ and it did _ Barkley said Francis might
just want to knock someone down. If nothing else, it might have
slowed the Milwaukee Bucks. But then again, Tuesday night Sam
Cassell probably could have scored from the seat of his pants, too.
</P>
<P>
   Cassell was so dominant Tuesday, he called former Rockets
teammate Mario Elie from the locker room before the game to
announce he would score 35, then hit it.
</P>
<P>
   Having offered Francis, the next San Jacinto College point guard
in the NBA, all the lessons he could over the phone, Cassell moved
Francis on to more advanced studies, carrying the Bucks to a 98-93
win in the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   After Cassell punished his former team with 35 points, the
results of the arena referendum were coming in and the measure was
routed even more handily, rendering the Rockets' future in Houston
uncertain. And for the first time since 1995, tickets to Compaq
Center went unclaimed, with just 14,491 on hand for the opener.
</P>
<P>
   With that sort of start to the season, perhaps Barkley's
violence suggestion would have been worth trying.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a guy's got 30 on me, I've got a flagrant (foul),'' Barkley
said. ``Fifteen-for-20, we've got to do better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides making 15 of 20 shots, Cassell collected 11 assists.
Francis was in many ways more in control than in most of the
preseason, committing just two turnovers, but he made just four of
13 shots and was the closest defender to most of Cassell's blitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody gets a lesson in the NBA,'' Cassell said. ``I got
mine from Kevin Johnson. But Steve will be all right. He can play,
once he understands the game better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets were left hoping for similar growth. Francis might
have been the Houston point guard, but Cassell often torched the
Rockets as a whole, ducking around picks or finding cracks in the
lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do a better job with our defense,'' guard Shandon
Anderson said. ``When you have breakdowns offensively, your defense
has to make stops.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Cassell can be an offensive magician, there were times he
didn't have to be. With the smallest of openings, he could
quick-release jumpers while Francis worked his way around screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a hard time getting Sam under control,'' coach Rudy
Tomjanovich said. ``You can't just put the blame on the guy on him.
He would turn the corner, and a lot of times our help wasn't there.
And the guy made some really tough shots in traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   His partner in the backcourt, Ray Allen, also found ways to
knock down difficult shots, adding 19 points on 8-of-14 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   But for all their defensive struggles and their occasionally
ragged offensive execution against the Bucks' low-post double
teams, the Rockets had all sorts of chances to pull out a win.
Hakeem Olajuwon and Barkley combined to take only 15 shots, making
nine for a combined 25 points. But the Rockets worked the ball well
enough outside for six players to score in double figures. They
were outstanding on the offensive boards, turning 15 offensive
rebounds into 23 second-chance points.
</P>
<P>
   For a stretch of the first half, the Rockets even seemed to have
mastered the Bucks' double teams. They had fallen nine back in less
than six minutes. But Olajuwon began to pick apart the Bucks'
double teams, setting up Francis, Anderson and Cuttino Mobley for
3-pointers, and passing to Mobley for a driving layup.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 4{ minutes of the first quarter, the Rockets
outscored the Bucks 17-6 and scored the first four points of the
second quarter for an 11-0 run. But the Rockets never could solve
the Bucks' wealth of offensive weapons.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind by six in the fourth quarter, they made a
move on the Bucks. Barkley grabbed an offensive rebound to set up
Bryce Drew for a 3 and then slapped away a Tim Thomas break. The
Rockets moved within two on a Kelvin Cato free throw. But Dale
Ellis retrieved a blocked shot to fire in a 3, Cassell scored the
next two times he touched the ball and the Bucks were rolling.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets still had a chance with 2:12 left, Francis beat
Cassell on the baseline and viciously slammed home a drive to pull
the Rockets within 95-92. Olajuwon blocked a Glenn Robinson attempt
in the lane. And after grabbing the loose ball, Francis was fouled.
</P>
<P>
   But Francis made just one of his free throws, allowing the Bucks
to remain ahead by two. Olajuwon even provided another chance,
forcing Allen to leave a driving jumper short. But the Rockets
could not get a good shot. Francis had to toss up an off-balance 3
to beat the shot clock, and Olajuwon ran out of stops.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon fouled Robinson, who knocked down both free throws for
a four-point lead. Francis missed a wide-open 3, and the Rockets
were forced to foul and hope.
</P>
<P>
   But Cassell made one more free throw for a five-point lead and
precisely the point total he had promised Elie three hours earlier.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WITH all those empty seats when the game began, you wondered if the
Rockets zealots were still standing in line at the polls. Alas, the
problem with such a hopeful assumption was that the polls closed at
7 p.m. and tipoff wasn't until 7:30.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Compaq Center, the mood was, well, reserved. A less
electric atmosphere, certainly for a season opener, was hard to
imagine. Had the Rockets already announced they were moving to New
Orleans, where a new hoops palace is opening? Honestly, that's how
quiet our would-be doomed Greenway Plaza gym was.
</P>
<P>
   Folks must have known. On both counts.
</P>
<P>
   The arena vote went sort of like the game. The Rockets got down
early, but things weren't as bad as they could have been, and there
was much reason for optimism by halftime, with the revamped home
team on top by eight points. But Houston's fortunes sagged
thereafter and, well, there went the perfect record.
</P>
<P>
   One defeat in an 82-game season, of course, hardly carries much
in the way of long-term damage. Also, seeing the sellout streak end
at 176 added to the gloomy mood, but it was inevitable considering
ticket prices have climbed again, lots of expendable income is
being diverted to Astros seats for Enron Park's debut and the
Rockets are now four seasons removed from a championship.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the consequences of the defeated arena referendum are
infinitely more ominous, particularly with rumors of a drop-dead
offer on the table from the Crescent City. It's so good, local
Chicken Littles would have us believe, the Rockets could even
afford to buy their way out of the final three seasons of their
local lease and leave by next fall.
</P>
<P>
   In short, if Houston's NBA franchise has had an all-around more
miserable, depressing evening in its 29-year history here, nobody
could remember it. Meanwhile, Mayor Lee Brown was downtown
accepting congratulations for his foregone conclusion of a
re-election, but it also was as empty a triumph as we've seen in
these parts in ages.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's critics say he gave Leslie Alexander far too sweet a
deal to ensure the referendum's place on the ballot, and that is
what voters ultimately rejected, not the NBA or Alexander, who
lacks a popular base of support despite the five titles his
organization has given the city.
</P>
<P>
   He continues to be seen as an outsider, and no wonder. He
refuses to buy a home here, even for the sake of appearances.
Worse, Alexander had been one of the mayor's leading campaign
contributors. Many disliked the way that smelled, which made the
reasonable compromise of a financing package look worse than it
was.
</P>
<P>
   Listen, Les was putting up a whole bunch more front money,
certainly percentage-wise, than either Drayton McLane Jr. or Bob
McNair was asked to for their stadiums. Apples and oranges, you may
argue because of the different economics of the different-sized
venues, but that's just reality.
</P>
<P>
   With a fifth of the vote counted, the pro-arena side was down by
only 6 percent, a 14-percent improvement from the evening's initial
report, which was 60-40 against. That absentee deficit of some
7,700 more nays than yeas was 2,300 ahead of what former Mayor Bob
Lanier, a staunch arena activist, called the ``break-even'' point.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, starting off less than 10,000 in the hole was
considered a positive by the proponents on the theory that folks
who went to the trouble of voting ahead of time were likely to be,
for the most part, adamantly opposed.
</P>
<P>
   The original stadium referendum in 1996, onto which this
referendum was attempting to piggyback, followed a similar pattern:
worrisome news early and then a gradual shifting of the tide,
culminating in a late rush of ``fors'' that secured a narrow but
sufficient, close-only-counts-in-hand-grenades victory. And that
fight, in theory, should have been a far harder one to win than the
current one.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, however, the spread never closed to less than 6 percent
_ a breathless, erroneous Channel 11 report notwithstanding _ and
wound up 54.72 percent against to 45.28 percent for, with 100
percent of precincts reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the pro-arena forces can be accused of overconfidence.
They spent a mere $1.5 million to sell their case compared to
$750,000 by the ``no'' crowd, spearheaded by Aeros owner Chuck
Watson, who holds the lease to Compaq Center and dislikes Les with
a passion. Experts on such matters say the ``pros'' should outspend
the ``cons'' by a three- or four-to-one margin to ensure they get
their way.
</P>
<P>
   What happens next is anybody's guess, but there figures to be no
good news near term. You'll hear a lot of dire predictions and
veiled threats. Alexander won't swallow the loss well. If you voted
your conscience Tuesday, be proud. You did your duty. But also be
forewarned: The Rockets and the Comets have just become free-agent
franchises.
</P>
<P>
   If there is another deal to be salvaged here, chances are it
will be worse for the city than the one you just got killed.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
SAN ANTONIO _ The issue has been decided, and so, too, it seems,
has the Rockets' future.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Houstonians voted down the referendum for the Rockets' new
downtown arena, perhaps paving the way for Leslie Alexander's
franchise to leave the city.
</P>
<P>
   David Stern, commissioner of the NBA, said Tuesday night the
league would not stand in the way if Alexander decided to move the
Rockets to another city, where he could get a more revenue-friendly
arena.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike the NFL, don't expect another NBA franchise to come
Houston's way, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I don't think so,'' Stern said. ``We have no plans for
expansion right now, and I just don't think that we will see the
hopscotching of teams (moving from one city to another).
</P>
<P>
   ``People have asked me why we've had so little team movement in
the NBA, and the reason is that movement, which is very often
facility-generated, is diminished since most of the NBA cities have
decided that they wanted a mid-sized, modern facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``And once you have it, between basketball, family events,
conventions and hockey, it makes more sense economically. And as a
result, we've managed to sort of tie our teams into their cities.
That's why we've had so little movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern said that even though Alexander has spent freely to put a
winning franchise on the floor in both the NBA and the WNBA, where
the Comets have won three consecutive championships, that type of
spending simply cannot go on without a new arena and the revenue
that comes with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's something that he's been able to do (spend
money to put a contending team on the floor), but the handwriting
is on the wall _ in the absence of a new arena, that's a declining
ability, clearly,'' Stern said. ``They will stay (for now). They
will honor their lease, without question.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Afterward) is up to Les, but everybody knows that it will
become exceeding improbable for a team to compete without the new
revenue streams that a new facility represents.''
</P>
<P>
   With five new arenas opening this year _ the Pepsi Center in
Denver, the Staples Center in Los Angeles, Conseco Fieldhouse in
Indianapolis, Philips Arena in Atlanta and American Airlines Arena
in Miami _ and the citizens of San Antonio passing the Spurs' arena
referendum, the Rockets are one of only two teams without a
competitive arena (New Jersey is the other).
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Center was opened as The Summit in 1975, making it the
second-oldest arena in the league. Madison Square Garden was opened
in 1968 but underwent extensive renovation between 1989 and 1991,
when every seat was replaced, and club suites, food courts and
restaurants were added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that in order for a team to compete in this league,
they have to have a state-of-the-art arena,'' Stern said. ``They
don't have to have it immediately, but they have to have it in the
near future. They have to have plans. That's one of the things I
always said about San Antonio _ the (Alamo)dome will be fine for
the next couple of years, but it has to morph into something _ a
planned new arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability to have 1,500 to 2,000 club seats, to have the
revenue from restaurants and the suite revenues _ it's a huge
difference between having them and not having them (when
considering) the ability to compete.''

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
SAN ANTONIO _ The Spurs raised the curtain on the 1999-2000 season
Tuesday by celebrating the franchise's first championship. And
while they were saluting their past by raising a championship
banner, the Spurs were waiting for the decision on their future to
come down.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It did, with the citizens of San Antonio overwhelmingly passing
a referendum for the Spurs' new arena.
</P>
<P>
   It was a night for celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs, who kicked off the new season by downing the
Philadelphia 76ers 89-76 at the Alamodome, received their
championship rings from NBA commissioner David Stern in a pre-game
ceremony honoring San Antonio's romp through the 1999 playoffs. The
Spurs won the franchise's first championship by plowing through the
New York Knicks in five games in the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to extend the congratulations of the NBA to the
ownership of the Spurs and the fans in this spectacular city,''
Stern said from midcourt before handing out the rings. ``You all
know about the winning streaks (the Spurs won 31 of their last 36
regular-season games and then went 15-2 in the playoffs) and the
sacrifices this team made.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not only a great basketball team but a team that above
all else understands a sense of community and how important they
are to youngsters. Suffice it to say you should be very proud of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' he finally added, ``let's give out the rings.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 27,288 let loose with its loudest roar not for
Mario Elie, Tim Duncan, Avery Johnson or David Robinson but rather
for Sean Elliott, who played every playoff game knowing he would
undergo offseason surgery to replace a failing kidney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm the guy who's supposed to speak for all the
players,'' Elliott said. ``The feeling among the guys is that if
they could take a piece of this (the ring) and give it to all of
you, we gladly would.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we can say is, `Thank you. We appreciate it.' Thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   The rings were 14-karat gold with a circle of diamonds and a
spur on top. The sides of the ring featured a ``15-2''
(representing the team's playoff record), the player's name and
number, the championship trophy, and a hammer and rock,
representing the team motto.
</P>
<P>
   And on the night the Spurs were feted as the league's No. 1
team, they finished the special occasion by knocking off the
Sixers, who had a No. 1 of their own in Allen Iverson, the top
scorer in the league last season (26.8 points).
</P>
<P>
   Iverson's 28 points, all in the first three quarters, topped
both teams in the scoring column. Duncan led the Spurs with 20
points and 16 rebounds, all also coming in the first three
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   But this night was all about another kind of victory _ the new
arena.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, the true future of the franchise, has refused to discuss
a contract extension until the end of the season, when he can weigh
all the factors involved in such a decision. He always has said a
new arena would weigh heavily in his decision process, even though
he wouldn't shed much light on his future after Tuesday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The end of the season is when the decision will be made,''
Duncan said. ``It's great _ really exciting to put that (the
referendum) behind us. It looks like the arena is going to pass and
the Spurs are going to stay here, but my decision is still going to
come at the end of the year.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IF those had been ballots instead of baskets, we could only
conclude Sam Cassell's beliefs in the political process run akin to
those of the late Richard Daley: Vote early, and vote often.
</P>
<P>
   There hasn't been this big a landslide since Nixon whomped
McGovern, and in this case rookie Steve Francis doesn't even get
the consolation of clinging to the door prize of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, the inclination was to check Francis for
windburn after watching Cassell go around him and by him for 35
points in an NBA baptism that was along the lines of having the
preacher drop you in a fast-moving, deep river.
</P>
<P>
   When the 98-93 season-opening loss to the Milwaukee Bucks was
complete Tuesday, the other desire was to adjust those projections
for when this new-look bunch of Rockets will come together. Perhaps
to somewhere around the time we've constructed a working space
station or a new downtown arena.
</P>
<P>
   Athleticism, yes. But exercise without consequences is merely
calisthenics.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the 2,000 or so who preferred to stay away, ending the
five-year string of sellouts at the Laptop, just weren't in the
mood for reconstruction. Or maybe they were just going with the
current mood.
</P>
<P>
   On the night when the citizenry of Houston said a resounding no
to building the Rockets a new home, the Bucks swept into town and
locked them out of their present one.
</P>
<P>
   They did it by getting just enough offense out of a curious mix
of world-weary veterans and young talent to confound and confuse
the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   There was, of course, Cassell at the wheel, fueled by the notion
of another homecoming to the place where he won a pair of NBA
championships in his first two seasons in the league and where he
still believes it should be him _ not Francis _ running the
Rockets' offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned that there are other people in this league who can
outscore me,'' said Francis, who settled for 14 points. ``When you
shoot 15-for-20 on any night, then it's going to add up for you.
But Sam Cassell didn't really teach me anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he'll get a better understanding of the lesson when
somebody shows Francis the game tape and asks him to write on the
blackboard 100 times: ``I must not let my man eat me up like a bowl
of chips.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe all of the Rockets will get a better comprehension that it
is one thing to be excited about a whole new cast of characters but
another thing to stitch them together into a quilt.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there were moments for the highlight reels. There was
Francis rocketing along the right baseline in the fourth quarter
and exploding in front of Ray Allen for a firecracker of a dunk.
</P>
<P>
   There was Walt Williams strumming in a couple of outside shots
and doing a nifty dance step down the lane for a running banker.
There was Shandon Anderson running the floor and filling the lanes
on the break. There was Cuttino Mobley playing even more
confidently, if that's possible.
</P>
<P>
   From the oldies department, there was Hakeem Olajuwon dropping
in an 18-footer on the left baseline and spinning under the hoop
for a reverse layup. And there was Charles Barkley getting inside
position for one of his 11 rebounds, feeding Bryce Drew for a
3-pointer, then hustling back down the floor to make a major
rejection of the Bucks' Tim Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   What it all means is that if Rudy Tomjanovich is building a
model airplane, he's still in the process of gluing the wings on,
let alone getting the thing to fly.
</P>
<P>
   This was a team that despite a low (including the preseason) of
18 turnovers, still made far too many for the kind of deliberate
game the Bucks were playing. It was a team that often looked
befuddled in the second half as the shot clock ran down and wound
up taking a forced heave rather than a well-executed shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks were just another team _ and the first of many this
season in light of the new defensive rules _ that consistently
double-teamed inside on Olajuwon and Barkley, limiting them to nine
and six shots, respectively, forcing the other Rockets to beat
them. Which, at this early stage, was not going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw some positives,'' Rudy T said. ``We knew it was going to
take time. But I believe in what we're doing with this team and
that we'll get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe before they get to New Orleans.

KINGS MAKE IT FIVE STRAIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Ziggy Palffy didn't want to get into a game of home
run derby with Jaromir Jagr.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy knows what it is like to be the big gun on a losing team
and it doesn't compare to what the Kings are now doing.
</P>
<P>
   So even though he matched Jagr's two goals with a pair of his
own, Palffy would only talk about the Kings' 5-4 victory over the
Pittsburgh Penguins on Tuesday that gives them five consecutive
wins heading into tonight's game in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so much more fun,'' said Palffy, who had three
consecutive 40-goal seasons for the lowly New York Islanders. ``You
don't want to get into anything with Jagr. You know what he can do.
You just want to pull together as a team and keep this thing
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Since their embarrassing 6-3 loss to Phoenix at Staples Center
almost two weeks ago, the 9-3-2 Kings have been on a roll, twice
beating the 2-5-3 Penguins, who remain winless this season at the
Civic Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh had the crowd of 14,272 in a frenzy when it went wide
open for the first 10 minutes and the final three minutes of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Despite two goals by Jagr late in the third period and two
earlier by Robert Lang, the Kings controlled much of the rest
behind goaltender Jamie Storr.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy, who joined the team with Bryan Smolinski during the
summer, tied the score at one with 2 minutes, 10 seconds left in
the first period. But already the game was beginning to turn in the
Kings' favor.
</P>
<P>
   It began midway through the period when defenseman Rob Blake put
a fierce check on Penguins winger Matthew Barnaby, who was just
returning to action after knee problems. He reinjured the knee and
did not return.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did the Penguins momentum. To that point, Pittsburgh
outshot the Kings 7-1. It was even the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to talk about a play, talk about that one,''
Palffy said. ``That was the turning point. They were just going up
and down the ice and it was tough to keep playing our style. That
one play showed we were still in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Palffy's goal came on the power play with Pittsburgh's Andrew
Ference off for holding. Palffy got behind the defense and took a
pass in front from Blake. Penguins goalie Peter Straka went down
and Palffy poked it over his shoulder for his fourth goal of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see what he can do offensively, even if it doesn't show in
the goals column right now,'' Kings coach Andy Murray said. ``He
wants to be known as much more than a goal scorer. He wants people
to see he is a total player.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, until a late flurry by the Penguins, the Kings took
over.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the second period, Donald Audette scored the
first of his two goals on a turnaround shot from 15 feet that
somehow made it past Skudra.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings built the lead to 4-2 early in the third period when
Audette _ and both teams _ watched seldom-used Vladimir Tsyplakov
do a Russian ballet past two Pittsburgh defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Tsyplakov, playing on the second line because of an ankle injury
to Glen Murray, threaded a pass to Audette in front.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do that in practice,'' said Tsyplakov, who didn't play the
prior six games. ``Tonight I got to do it in a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Jagr provided much of the entertainment from there. He cut the
Kings lead to 4-3 with 5:27 then added his second goal with 2:11
left. In between he misfired on two passes to Lang in front of
Storr.
</P>
<P>
   But between Jagr's show, Palffy made the Kings lead stand up. He
intercepted a pass at the Pittsburgh blue line and beat Straka
in-close.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing better right now than what we are doing,''
Palffy said. ``Everyone is in this together.''

ODOM GIVES CLIPPERS SOME HOPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Lamar Odom had waited half his life for this
night. For 10 years he had dreamed and schemed and careened toward
this meeting with Destiny.
</P>
<P>
   It was every kid's dream date Odom was keeping Tuesday night.
Men have slept in their clothes and sweated through their shirts
and cooled their heels for hours for lesser engagements.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it was so odd to see no sign of Odom in the Clippers
dressing room some 15 minutes after the last of his teammates had
straggled into Staples Center for their season opener against
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:21 p.m., nine minutes before he was supposed to be on the
floor for warmups, Odom rushed into the dressing room, looking
mildly flustered. The driver he had hired for this momentous
occasion, he explained as he fumbled with his shoelaces and his
buttons and his packet of complimentary game tickets, had gotten
stuck in downtown gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   In his rush to get ready, the 19-year-old seemed not to notice
the irony: Odom took a couple of circuitous detours the past couple
of years and maneuvered around countless roadblocks before that,
just so he could get caught in a traffic jam on the way to his NBA
debut.
</P>
<P>
   Blame Odom for all the cars on the road; 17,847 people wanted to
be able to say they saw the official unveiling of the next Magic
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Those who came to be bewitched by Odom had no reason to leave
bummed. The rookie out of Rhode Island showed plenty of panache in
the Clippers' 104-92 loss. Despite being, by his own admission,
``really anxious'' Odom coolly delivered 30 points on 10-of-18
shooting, 12 rebounds, two blocked shots and three assists in 44
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of start that can turn hype into hope for the
most forlorn fans in the league. Odom's numbers made Johnson's
Lakers debut 20 years ago seem mundane. The Magic Man had 26
points, eight rebounds, four assists, one steal and three turnovers
in 41 minutes _ against the Clippers, of all teams.
</P>
<P>
   Odom knows Johnson's legacy will shadow him wherever he goes. It
comes with the territory in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try to focus on the basketball game and not get caught
up in all the media,'' Odom said. ``Let the people do all their
talking. I don't really pay attention to what's being said.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing, or his clean-shaven head would be too big for
his sweatband. Former Lakers coach Pat Riley, who choreographed
Showtime, watched Odom work out for the Miami Heat before the June
draft and was moved to compose a three-page letter.
</P>
<P>
   The gist of Riley's message to Odom, the forward said, was ``if
I work hard I can be one of the best players who ever played this
game.''
</P>
<P>
   For someone whose moves are so smooth, his path to the NBA sure
has been a struggle. His mother Cathy died when he was 12 (he
honored her memory Tuesday by writing her name on his sneakers) and
Odom faltered for a few years without her guidance.
</P>
<P>
   He attended three schools in his final year of high school, left
UNLV amid allegations he had cheated on a standardized test, played
one year at Rhode Island and second-guessed his decision to turn
pro this year before an NCAA ruling left him no choice but to move
on.
</P>
<P>
   He also was a no-show at the NBA combine. That is the kind of
youthful indiscretion that dies slow but is nothing a fast start
with the Clippers can't bury.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandma always said bad things don't last forever,'' said
Odom, who turns 20 on Saturday. ``It's a whole new day for me, a
whole new start.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said of the Clippers. Their fans, eager to
distance themselves from the club's sorry past, booed former
Clipper favorite Brent Barry, who's now with Seattle, during the
pregame introductions.
</P>
<P>
   Old images are hard to shake, even with so much new blood and a
new building to boot. Second-year center Michael Olowokandi said
that after the Clippers beat Chicago during the exhibition season,
he heard a Bulls fan say, ``I can't believe we lost to the
Clippers.''
</P>
<P>
   Believe it, these Clippers are, as one cynical scribe put it,
``not as bad as a lot of Clipper teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Odom gives them a chance to be pretty good. &QL;

 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time in Virginia's long political history,
Republicans took control of the Old Dominion's General Assembly on
Tuesday, seizing a majority in the House of Delegates and holding
onto the slim edge the party already had in the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But on a day in which off-year elections also were held in
dozens of other states around the country, with party leaders
watching carefully for hints, if any, of things to come in Election
2000, Democrats also enjoyed some signal victories.
</P>
<P>
   They captured the mayor's offices of both Indianapolis and
Columbus, Ohio, two major Midwestern cities that had been solidly
in Republican control for almost three decades.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Gov. Paul Patton of Kentucky, also a Democrat,
was re-elected to a second term.
</P>
<P>
   There were also some important referendum votes, most notably in
Maine, where voters approved a ballot measure to legalize marijuana
for medical use but rejected a hotly disputed proposal to ban
certain late-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The General Assembly voting in Virginia left Republicans in the
best political shape in the state in memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy has final come to the commonwealth,'' Gov. Jim
Gilmore, a Republican, said as the final tallies rolled in and the
full extent of the Democratic defeat became clear.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans had won the governor, lieutenant governor and
attorney general posts in 1997. Now that they control the
legislature, too, they are positioned not only to set the governing
agenda but also to control the congressional redistricting process
that will begin after the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the two parties combined to spend more than $25 million,
a record, in the struggle to gain full control of the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, the chairman of the Republican National
Committee, saw the day's voting as ``a bellwether for all the
elections which are going to be held all over America next year.''
Similarly, Joe Andrew, the chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, called the voting ``a precursor to the most important
election in a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the initial results were too mixed and incomplete to
provide any solid indication of what next year's elections might
bring. Both sides had their ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
   In the Indianapolis voting, Bart Peterson, a developer, captured
most of that city's growing minority vote to become the first
Democratic mayor in 30 years. He defeated Sue Anne Gilroy, a
Republican serving her second term as Indiana's secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   The race was the most expensive in the city's history, with more
than $5 million spent overall by Peterson, who pushed downtown
development and crime control, and Ms. Gilroy, who hoped her
promise to shrink the government would make her the city's first
woman to be elected mayor. Peterson won by about 10 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   But equally as important as the money poured into the campaign
was the changing make-up of the city. Many whites, especially
Republicans, have moved to the suburbs in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The incumbent mayor, Stephen Goldsmith, a Republican who has
been in office since 1991, chose not to run for a third term.
</P>
<P>
   In the Columbus race, the Democratic winner was Michael Coleman,
a black who has been serving as president of the City Council and
who, when he takes over the mayor's office next year, will be the
city's first black chief executive. He defeated Dorothy Teater, a
Republican who has been a county commissioner for the past 15 years
and who would have been the first woman to be mayor of Columbus had
she defeated Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans had held the mayor's office since 1972. Coleman beat
Ms. Teater by almost 10 percentage points after campaigning on his
record as president of the City Council and on a promise to improve
city neighborhoods. Ms. Teater sought to paint Coleman as a
councilman who had cast votes that wasted city funds.
</P>
<P>
   The incumbent mayor, Greg Lashutka, first elected in 1991, chose
not to run again.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kentucky governor's race, Patton, the first Kentucky
chief executive eligible to seek a successive term in two
centuries, thanks to a recent change in state law, won more than 60
percent of the vote in easily sweeping past his two leading
challengers, Peppy Martin, a Republican, and Gatewood Galbraith, a
member of the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a message in the Patton victory in a state in which
both parties have been competitive in recent years, it was that
taking on an incumbent is almost always uphill and taking on an
incumbent with a job approval rating close to 65 percent is close
to impossible, especially for challengers with low name recognition
and fringe issues.
</P>
<P>
   Patton, a political moderate, did not bother to start
campaigning until September, and did not run his first television
commercial until last week. Mainly, he pitched his record of
pushing for jobs, education reform, government efficiency, better
health care and tougher penalities for lawbreakers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Martin, a freelance publicist, was shunned by many prominent
members of her party after she charged, without offering any
evidence, that 80 percent of Kentucky's sheriffs and 30 percent of
its state police officers were involved in the drug trade. She also
wondered aloud at one point about how Mrs. Patton, who was a widow
when she married the governor, lost her first husband.
</P>
<P>
   Galbraith, a lawyer, called for legalization of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   In elections elsewhere, Mississippi also elected a governor and
New Jersey, like Virginia, got a new legislature. There also were
other important mayor's races in Philadelphia and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   And there were important ballot measures, too, besides those in
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Francisco area, there were referenda on banning ATM
fees and slowing growth. Ballots in Colorado and Kansas City, Mo.,
carried referendums on financing urban transit systems, and ballots
in Houston, San Antonio, St. Paul and Scottsdale, Ariz., had
measures on financing new sports facilities.

LAKERS WIN OPENER
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Like the frozen moment that defined his last
official NBA game, Phil Jackson's coaching career was locked in
freeze-frame until tipoff here Tuesday night, and when the shutter
unclicked, it was clear just how much the scenery around him had
changed.
</P>
<P>
   Where he left on Michael Jordan's awe-inspiring,
championship-clinching jump shot, Jackson returned on a botched
pass from Glen Rice to Shaquille O'Neal _ the opening sequence of
the Lakers' season opener against the Utah Jazz. Same court, same
opponent, all new challenges for Jackson, not the least of which is
winning without Jordan. Or even his presumed heir, Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson's personal success on the Delta Center floor was
extended another game anyway, as his Lakers pulled out a
hard-fought, if entirely unaesthetic, 91-84 victory before 19,911.
</P>
<P>
   There was little in Jackson's Laker debut to brag about. The
triangle looked jagged-edged, the defense sagged at all the wrong
moments, but a resurgent Rice (28 points) and clutch shooting from
Derek Fisher (eight points in the fourth quarter) gave Jackson a
1-0 Lakers record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased about the way we performed down the stretch. Both
teams looked like they were kind of stumbling around out there.
They weren't in condition yet to play this game,'' Jackson said.
``I thought the game was obviously one of those early ones you
write off later in the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Between stumbles, the Lakers proved to be ace 3-point shooters,
hitting 8 of 13, four of them by Rice and Fisher in the decisive
fourth quarter. Fisher's last 3-pointer was the Lakers' biggest
shot of the night, if not his three-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Successive baskets by Karl Malone and John Stockton cut the
Lakers' lead to 84-82 with a minute to go. But Fisher, standing at
the right corner, took a feed from Rice and nailed the 3-pointer to
make it a five-point game.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal, who finished with 23 points, missed two free
throws that could have sealed the win, but when Utah's Pete
Chilcutt clanked a wide-open 3-pointer, the Lakers had held on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The three years I've been here, I really hadn't been in those
types of situations much,'' Fisher said of his game-turning shot.
``Especially to actually take the shot. That's the one thing I love
about our coaching staff, is all five players on the floor in this
offense are required to be potent offensive threats.... I
definitely felt comfortable jumping up and taking that shot.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Rice, which was a vast difference from a week ago, when
he closed out the exhibition season with an 0-for-10 night against
the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys would probably think I was lying,'' Rice told
reporters, ``but I knew once the season started I'd be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   No argument here. Rice found his stroke early with a few plays
run his way, then kept the rhythm, finishing 8 of 13, 5 of 6 from
the arc and a perfect 7 for 7 from the foul line. He added six
rebounds and three assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their 3-point shots killed us out there,'' Utah coach Jerry
Sloan said.
</P>
<P>
   So did a subpar performance from Malone. After missing most of
the exhibition season because of back problems, Malone played like
a man in pain, scoring just 14 points on 4-of-10 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, it looked like the Lakers would be the ones without
their top weapon. Already woefully undermanned in the frontcourt,
they got an early chill when O'Neal picked up his second and third
fouls in rapid succession late in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But he avoided further whistles and was able to play a pivotal
role in the fourth. Despite his missed foul shots, he scored six in
the quarter and kept the Jazz defense honest, leaving Fisher and
Rice open for the key shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``They doubled, and I looked for my teammates,'' O'Neal said.
``It's going to take a total team effort for us to get where we are
trying to go.''

CLIPPERS LOSE OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Lamar Odom, who is to Clipper fans as a rescue
plane was to the castaways on ``Gilligan's Island,'' must have felt
marooned Tuesday night in his NBA debut.
</P>
<P>
   Teammate and incumbent go-to guy Maurice Taylor rode the bench
with foul trouble. To make matters even trickier, there were no
picks. No cuts. No appreciable help - and the Clipper defense
seemed as primitive as can be.
</P>
<P>
   But even though Odom will be 20 years old Saturday, he wasn't
too young to teach the Staples Center crowd (17,874 out of 18,964
seats) a lesson in old-school gamesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie from Rhode Island finished with 30 points and 12
rebounds, leading the Clippers to a ... hold on, they lost their
season opener, 104-92, to the Seattle SuperSonics. Remember, the
castaways had trouble bringing it home, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about Lamar Odom's performance,'' said Lamar
Odom, already speaking in a third person who probably couldn't
guard him, either. ``I'm worried about the Clipper's performance.
It's all about team now.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to All-Star point guard Gary Payton (22 points, 13
assists) and nuclear sub Vernon Maxwell (29 points) the Sonics
certainly looked like the better team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't so a very good job on perimeter defense,'' said
Coach Chris Ford, who was sentenced to explain the obvious in a
typical post-game press chat. ``We couldn't dig ourselves out of
the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Throwing on his share of dirt was Maxwell, who scored 18 points
in the second quarter, during which Seattle outscored the Clippers,
37-26, for a 62-48 halftime advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who finished with 14 points, 3 rebounds and 6 fouls for
the Clippers in 26 minutes, had picked up 4 personals by then.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the new rules, I have to be more disciplined,'' Taylor
said. ``It was just a bad game all around for us.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, the evidence:
</P>
<P>
   Seattle held a 53-45 edge on the boards. The Clippers did hold
the Sonics to 37.5 percent marksmanship from the field (the Clips
shot at a 45-percent rate), but forced only 11 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so the stats weren't that revealing, but Odom knew where to
look for clues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary Payton,'' Odom explained. ``He controlled the tempo of
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clips didn't have enough dance steps to keep pace.
</P>
<P>
   New Clipper Derek Anderson contributed what could be described
as a quiet 19 points, Michael Olowokandi had a game-high 16
rebounds and Tyrone Nesby supplied his typical juice off the bench
(16).
</P>
<P>
   But despite moving to a new house, the Clips spent much of the
evening performing like the same doormats.
</P>
<P>
   After pyrotechnics, smoke and hackneyed crowing by hired PA gun
Michael Buffer, the Clippers cut the ribbon on their home, suite
home by opening an 8-2 lead that included a pair of buckets by
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sonics settled down, rolling up leads of 7 points in the
first quarter, 17 in round two and 18 in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Odom, who had 14 points - despite missing half of a dozen free
throws - in the first half, really started to cook in the third
quarter. Despite being guarded by the 6-3 Payton, Odom (6-9) still
didn't receive any scripted action on the low post. So he
resurrected the Clipper offense with two buckets on sharp basket
cuts and a deep 3 that made it 80-71, Seattle, at 3:27.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't get any closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take a bad game and a win,'' Odom said in an attempt to
shrug off his encouraging heroics. ``We didn't want to start off
like this.''

SONICS' EASY WIN SPOILS CLIPPERS' GALA HOUSEWARMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There were fireworks, and enough smoke filled the
building to trip a few fire alarms.
</P>
<P>
   That went well with the rest of the snaps, crackles and pops the
Los Angeles Clippers used Tuesday night to open the Staples Center.
A big deal for the Clippers and their fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics had a blast, too.
</P>
<P>
   In spoiling the Clippers' party, the Sonics christened the NBA
regular season with a 104-92 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Vernon Maxwell got the most bang for his minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' 6-foot-4 hired gun scored 29 points in 28 minutes.
He provided a serious lift on a night when the Sonics shot just 39
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they're counting on me on a lot. So I just have to be
ready mentally and physically,'' said Maxwell, whose offense came
off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever is needed. I just want to win, and they knew that
when I came in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers were presumably unsuspecting when Maxwell first
came off the bench. He missed his first two shots. Then, Maxwell
lived up to his nickname Mad Max and went crazy against the
Clippers' defense, hitting eight of his next 14.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Maxwell thwarted every comeback attempt the
Clippers threw at the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Gary Payton racked up 13 assists _ to go with 22
points _ making sure Maxwell did not go cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called his play about five times in a row once,'' Payton
said. ``Once I see that (he's in a rhythm), I'm going to get it to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   As well as Maxwell played offensively, it was the Sonics'
defensive pressure that made the difference. They forced the
Clippers into 18 turnovers and scored 25 points off of them.
Maurice Taylor, the Clippers' best post player, was never a factor.
He fouled out with 8:29 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the exception of (Clippers rookie Lamar) Odom getting the
calls, we defended their big people well,'' said Vin Baker, who
chipped in 17 points and 12 rebounds. ``Getting Taylor in foul
trouble early helped.''
</P>
<P>
   Clippers fans might have been excused early if not for Odom. The
6-foot-10 forward's all-around play made it so the Clippers
threatened in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics had increased their 62-48 halftime lead to 18 points
with 9:30 left in the period. Odom, though, sparked a 20-11 Clipper
run with nine points, including a 30-foot 3-pointer that cut the
Sonics' lead to 80-71.
</P>
<P>
   But even that did little to change the flow of the game. The
Sonics simply ran past the Clippers all night. Immediately after
Odom's basket, Payton ran down court and scooped in a layup,
regaining control for the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Rashard Lewis sank a 3-pointer as the buzzer sounded and
the Sonics took an 88-75 advantage into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't get our transition defense together, we're in for
a long season,'' Clippers coach Chris Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics separated themselves from the Clippers early in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   They led 31-30 with 8:57 left when Maxwell began punching holes
in the Clippers' defense. His nine points highlighted a 10-1 run
the Sonics used to storm ahead 42-32. He scored from three-point
range and piercing the lane for drives that resulted in free
throws.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell wasted little time showing just why the Sonics made him
their first free-agent acquisition this past off-season. He is
billed as a player who can score in bunches.
</P>
<P>
   His driving layup with 1:05 left in the second quarter put the
Sonics in front 60-44.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just carried us the whole second quarter,'' Sonics coach
Paul Westphal said. ``It was get the ball to Vernon and get out of
the way. Vernon's going to come in and make something happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics scored with seeming ease in the second quarter,
mostly because of their defense. Their pressure on the ball kept
the Clippers from running fast breaks. In halfcourt sets, the
Sonics allowed just one shot, rebounded the misses and sprinted the
other way.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good recovery for the Sonics after a sluggish start.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Patterson scored a dunk off the opening tip, but that
quickly was negated as the Sonics turned the ball over three times
in the next five possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson's rebounding and hustle helped the Sonics stay with
the Clippers early. The second-year forward had just two baskets in
the first quarter, but his dunk after a Payton dish put the Sonics
ahead 16-14, and they led the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   This was the third time in two years the Sonics had participated
in a new arena's first NBA game. Seattle helped opened the doors of
the MCI Center in 1997, losing to the Washington Wizards that
night.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, the Sonics played the Denver Nuggets Oct. 22 in
their first game at the Pepsi Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was very excited and none of that (pregame hoopla)
mattered to us,'' Baker said. ``We came in here with a purpose.
This is an exciting team to watch, and we're going to show we can
play this brand of basketball against anybody.''

BREEDERS' CUP IS RACING'S JUDGMENT DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ Start with Cigar, the 1995 Breeders' Cup
Classic winner, and Skip Away, the 1997 Breeders' Cup Classic
winner. The order is up to you. Cigar and Skip Away are the
quinella of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Then fill up the rest of your ``Best of the '90s'' honor roll
according to whatever criteria you prefer _ brilliance, staying
power, accomplishment or a combination of the three.
</P>
<P>
   The actual names will vary from racing fan to racing fan, but a
common thread is likely to be visible in any such list, and that's
the influence of the Breeders' Cup in creating and confirming
thoroughbred stars.
</P>
<P>
   Born at Hollywood Park in 1984, the Breeders' Cup came of age in
the '90s. While the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont Stakes
remain the pivotal races to the general public, the Breeders' Cup
has become the event by which the sport judges its four-legged
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   So it was no surprise that after an evening spent squinting at
yellowed Daily Racing Form charts, trying to narrow nearly a
decade's supply of North American horses down to 14 for a fantasy
``Race of the '90s,'' I find that my 14 is dominated by nine
Breeders' Cup winners and two Breeders' Cup runners-up.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday at Gulfstream Park near Miami, when upwards of 100
horses run in eight Breeders' Cup races, they won't just be
competing for $13 million in purses and year-end championships.
They'll be competing for mentions in the same breaths with the
greatest horses of the era.
</P>
<P>
   Horseplayers argue about great thoroughbreds the way baseball
fans argue about great outfielders. The nice thing about
thoroughbreds is they never lose chunks of their careers to
military service.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody should agree on this: Cigar was the star of the '90s.
His 16-race winning streak, matching Citation's from 1948-50, has
been the top accomplishment of a decade that failed to produce a
Triple Crown sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he was the !ital!best!off! of the '90s is debatable
because, on their best days, Skip Away was faster. And the gray
star of Sonny Hine's New York barn had an ability to run great
races back-to-back that set him apart from modern horses.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away was 3 years old when he won his only meeting with
Cigar by a head in the 1996 Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park.
</P>
<P>
   A less ceremonious torchpassing had occurred in the winter of
1995 at Gulfstream when Cigar won the Donn Handicap in which Holy
Bull was pulled up with a career-ending injury. You had to be no
closer than Arcadia that day to feel the power of Holy Bull's name.
</P>
<P>
   The Donn was to have been his prep for the Santa Anita Handicap.
A promotional campaign was built around him. Santa Anita executives
were crushed.
</P>
<P>
   For a horse who ran 12th in the 1994 Kentucky Derby, Holy Bull
sure bounced back nicely, winning four consecutive Grade I stakes
the rest of that year, including Belmont's Woodward against older
horses. Owner-trainer Jimmy Croll's decision to keep him out of the
Breeders' Cup cost the second-most-talented gray of the '90s a shot
at immortality.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a good decade for grays. (By now you understand I'm
not mentioning my selections in any order of merit. But see the
accompanying chart for the order I see them finishing in a
hypothetical race.)
</P>
<P>
   The nicely named Silver Charm has the distinction of being the
only Kentucky Derby or Preakness winner on this list. The only
other Derby winner considered was Unbridled, who won the Breeders'
Cup Classic as well in 1990, but his career was otherwise
unremarkable.
</P>
<P>
   The only Belmont Stakes winner on this list is A.P. Indy, the
Japanese-owned colt, who ran with his head curiously close to the
ground. He won the 1992 Classic the last time the Breeders' Cup was
held in Florida. It's hard not to wonder what he might have
accomplished if he hadn't been immediately retired to stud. It's
even more provocative to wonder how thoroughly he'd have dominated
the Derby he missed with a foot injury.
</P>
<P>
   Best Pal is one horse who left no mystery about his potential.
The only California-bred and only gelding on the list was among the
state's most popular runners from age 2 through age 7. He also was
the best handicap horse in the country for much of 1992 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The other eight in my imaginary starting gate demonstrate the
Breeders' Cup's greatest contribution _ providing the kind of stage
for 2-year-olds, for fillies and for turf specialists that the
Triple Crown races offer to 3-year-olds and the major handicap
races offer to older horses.
</P>
<P>
   Flawlessly and Serena's Song are the only two of the eight to
fail to win a Breeders' Cup race.
</P>
<P>
   Flawlessly was ninth against males in the 1993 Breeders' Cup
Mile. This year female turf specialists like her have a Breeders'
Cup race _ the Filly and Mare Turf _ to call their own. Serena's
Song was second (to barnmate Flanders) in the 1994 Juvenile Fillies
and second (to Jewel Princess) in the 1996 Distaff.
</P>
<P>
   The rest used the Breeders' Cup to prove they were the '90s
stars of their equine divisions: 2-year-old Arazi (sweeping
sensationally to the lead in the 1991 Juvenile); fillies
Silverbulletday (making the 1998 Juvenile Fillies the second of 12
consecutive victories against her age and gender) and Dance Smartly
(building on her Canadian Triple Crown in the 1991 Distaff); the
mare Paseana (winning the Distaff in 1992 and second in 1993); turf
marathoner Kotashaan (winning the 1993 Turf to clinch the decade's
only Horse of the Year title by a grass specialist); and turf miler
Lure (winning the 1992 and 1993 Miles, one of three repeaters in
Breeders' Cup history).
</P>
<P>
   A lot happened to racing in the '90s. Simulcasting became the
way most fans watched and bet. Major-track attendance bottomed out
and seemed to begin a recovery. The creation of the National
Thoroughbred Racing Association offered hope for new _ or any _
direction. Bob Baffert took over from D. Wayne Lukas as the
nation's dominant trainer. Bill Shoemaker retired and Laffit Pincay
rode ever closer to his career-winners record.
</P>
<P>
   And the Breeders' Cup became the measure of greatness. &QL;

UCLA LOSES LINEMAN SAFFER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA can't even have a good bye.
</P>
<P>
   Starting right guard Mike Saffer strained a ligament in his
right knee Tuesday and is not expected to return for the Bruins'
next game against Washington on Nov.13. He'll probably also miss
the finale against USC, according to the preliminary report from
the UCLA medical staff.
</P>
<P>
   Saffer strained the medial collateral ligament, which connects
the femur to the tibia, on the first play of a five-minute,
bye-week scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I say?'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo asked of the latest
episode in a season gone disastrous. ``What can I say?''
</P>
<P>
   Saffer, a redshirt freshman from Tucson, is one of the Bruins'
best young linemen. Senior Matt Phelan, who played at Lancaster's
Paraclete High, is expected to start in Saffer's place.
</P>
<P>
   Couch time: Toledo planned to start the bye week with a
scrimmage, then realized there weren't enough healthy players.
Instead, the Bruins ran sprints and spent much of Monday afternoon
in meetings, desperately seeking the cause of _ and remedy for _
their collapse.
</P>
<P>
   They've lost five of their last six and have been outscored
124-14 in the last 13 quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the players met with their position coaches, then I talked
to a bunch of them individually,'' Toledo said. ``You hear things.
Some things you hope to correct in a few days. Some things need
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The schedule: The Bruins (3-6, 1-5) will practice for two hours
today, then hold a light workout Thursday before breaking for a
three-day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Although they're spending a few minutes each day preparing for
Washington, their gaze is mostly internal: rebuilding shattered
confidence and honing fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, one week isn't enough time to correct the problems _
heck, one month isn't enough _ but it might help them be
competitive against the Huskies and Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be real easy to say that if there's a hole in the dike,
I'd put my finger in it,'' Toledo said. ``But I don't have enough
fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   Pausing to regroup: Perhaps no one needs the bye more than
quarterback Cory Paus, who has completed 41.4 percent of his passes
and averaged 135 yards in the last three games.
</P>
<P>
   He has two points of emphasis this week: improve his reading of
defenses, and learn to release the ball quicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm waiting for the receivers to get a little too open,
although I did a much better job (against Arizona) than against
Oregon State,'' he said. ``It comes with experience and running the
plays in game situations. It's not hoping, it's knowing what the
(receiver) is going to do. I don't have a feel for all the
receivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bracing for the hits: Paus is also trying to adjust to being a
pocket passer. Although the Bruins have several roll-out plays, he
spends considerable time dropping straight back into the pocket _
something he rarely did in high school _ and that makes him
vulnerable to the pass rush.
</P>
<P>
   He's been sacked 11 times in the last two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying not to let the rush affect me, but I never got hit
in high school,'' he said. ``That's new to me. The only time I got
hit was when I was the lead blocker on the reverse.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally: The announced crowd of 42,612 for the Arizona game
was UCLA's smallest home crowd in two years. School officials
blamed the small turnout on Halloween parties, the kickoff change _
it was preliminarily scheduled for 12:30 _ and the disappointing
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to thank the people who stayed to the end,'' Toledo
said. ``They're true Bruins.''

FOX CAUGHT IN EMOTIONAL TRAP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ John Fox's first official practice to claim the
USC starting quarterback position could have gone a little better
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was horrible. Absolutely horrible,'' Fox said. ``The worst
(practice) in my entire life.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting his first considerable playing time in two years
in last Saturday's loss to Cal, Fox came out overexcited Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just too hyper right now,'' Fox said. ``I can't even feel
my toes. I feel like a little kid. Especially today. I feel a lot
of life today.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's effort did not hurt his standing with USC coach Paul
Hackett, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a psychological reaction to `I'm getting more
reps and I have to be perfect,''' Hackett said. ``He needs a little
more time. I was pleased with some things and not pleased with some
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he will wait until the end of the week to make a
decision, although Fox is expected to start over incumbent Mike Van
Raaphorst.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to massage the game plan,'' Hackett said. ``We have
to be careful what to ask and what to expect of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox appeared to get more repetitions than Van Raaphorst on
Tuesday, and Hackett said he needed more time to evaluate the
situation, although he could also be trying to keep Arizona State
off-balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I can't make a decision. Let's see it unfold,''
Hackett said. ``Whatever it takes between the two to get a win
we'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox admitted that even though the Trojans lost to Cal, he was
re-energized by his quarterback appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel rejuvenated,'' Fox said. ``A little part of me just
came alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Young's a candidate: USC defensive coordinator Bill Young sent
his resume to Tulsa on Tuesday for the head-coaching position.
Tulsa currently has Pat Henderson serving as interim coach. Young
spent five years at Tulsa as an assistant, and was Oklahoma's
defensive coordinator before coming to USC in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to have it, I'm not downplaying it,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Young was a candidate for the University of Hawaii job last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Soward should play: After being listed as doubtful, wide
receiver R. Jay Soward (strained hamstring) practiced in about half
the drills and should be able to play against Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said Soward would practice today, then sit out
Thursday's and Friday's practice to rest his hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked better,'' Hackett said. ``But I thought he was
playing last Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Near record: Tailback Chad Morton has gained 721 yards, more
than any USC senior since Marcus Allen in 1981. The previous best
was Estrus Crayton's 700 yards in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond speaks: Arizona State tailback J.R. Redmond finally
spoke about his NCAA one-game punishment after he married a
part-time employee of the Arizona State athletic department, who
had given him illegal benefits and tried to blackmail him.
</P>
<P>
   ``One, nothing is for free. Two, you can't trust women,''
Redmond said. ``You always feel bad missing a game. But I paid the
price and it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts update: Offensive tackle Trevor Roberts will not
practice most of the week because of a broken bone in his wrist,
but will probably play. Offensive guard Faasea Mailo's status
remains in question because of a leg bruise.

LOST POWER COMES AT BAD TIME FOR LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ When the Lakers moved Robert Horry from
probable starter to injured-list member in a last-minute decision
Monday, they further debilitated what was already their weakest
position. Just in time for a matchup with Utah's Karl Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about tough calls.
</P>
<P>
   But coach Phil Jackson said Horry's troublesome left knee left
him little choice. It also left the Lakers with A.C. Green as their
only healthy, true power forward. Behind him are hobbled Travis
Knight, backup center John Salley and swingman Rick Fox, who is
redefining the term.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's multiple things going on with Robert, as far
as his endurance, the trauma around the knee, his lack of
confidence in it, coming up lame in the preseason game (after
playing one minute) and then sitting out two successive games,''
Jackson said. ``All those things were kind of bells going off in
our heads (that) this guy was under some duress and under some fear
factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a player play with that kind of fear or that kind of
trepidation is not what we wanted to do. We want him to be healthy
of mind with that thing too.... The other thing is the decision was
made on the move. Obviously, we didn't have a whole lot of time....
We felt under the situation, we had to do the best we could with
this team.''
</P>
<P>
   So Knight, who hadn't played in three weeks because of a severe
ankle sprain, was put on call for emergency relief, despite his own
assessment that he's not fully recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told coach that I'm not 100 percent yet,'' Knight sad, ``but
I told him if he needs me, I'll be more than happy to... go out
there and do what I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight said he would be better off resting another week and
joked, ``Ideally, I'd be better off waiting until February,'' but
declared himself ready anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Fox, who has split time at off-guard and both forward
slots in practice, said he was ready for Malone duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to think that's not something I have to do for an
82-game season, match up against guys like Karl Malone,'' he said,
``but 20 minutes here and there, yeah, I can survive. I'll find
ways to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Memories: Jackson returned to the Delta Center for the first
time since Michael Jordan's last-second shot clinched the Chicago
Bulls' sixth championship, in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just looked at that basket over there, that Michael dropped
that basket in, this morning, and thought how fortunate it was we
won it at that time,'' Jackson said. ``I don't know if we could
have won it another night if we had to go on. We were pretty much
banged up with (Scottie) Pippen injured.''
</P>
<P>
   Tribute: The Lakers donned black patches across the left
shoulder of their jerseys in memory of the late Wilt Chamberlain. A
short ceremony in Chamberlain's honor is scheduled for tonight's
home opener at Staples Center.

TSYPLAKOV MAKES CONTRIBUTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Vladimir Tsyplakov had been a healthy scratch the
past six games, and man was he itching to play.
</P>
<P>
   Early this season, Tsyplakov rarely shared in the Kings success,
which continued Tuesday night with a 5-4 victory over the
Pittsburgh Penguins in front of 14,272 at the Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the first or second lines the past two seasons,
Tsyplakov had been bounced to no man's land: Not enough moves for a
starring role, not enough grit to play the physical game.
</P>
<P>
   But when he took a pass at center ice early in the third period,
and started a dazzling sequence of stick handling past the Penguins
Martin Straka and Brad Werenka, the Kings were on their way to a
fifth consecutive victory.
</P>
<P>
   Tsyplakov blew past both, then threaded a pass in front of the
net, where Donald Audette poked in the Kings' fourth goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting dizzy just watching him handle the puck,''
Audette said.
</P>
<P>
   It gave the Kings a two-goal lead, which they needed because the
Penguins Jaromir Jagr scored two goals in the final 5{ minutes.
Ziggy Palffy got the eventual game-winner, but Tsyplakov's play was
not forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was electrifying the way he went through that team,'' coach
Andy Murray said. ``But the most impressive thing is the way he has
handled the cut in playing time. Even though he isn't playing, he
works so hard in practice. I told him, I know he plays for a coach
that doesn't like to make changes, but someday that work would play
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Tsyplokov got his chance when Glen Murray, the Kings'
second-line right winger, wasn't able to play. Murray came back
after getting struck in the left ankle during Monday's practice but
was forced off the ice during Tuesday's morning workout for X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not broken, that's the good thing,'' said Murray, who did
not rule out playing tonight against Detroit but probably will
return Friday at home against Philadelphia. ``When you see the way
(Tsyplakov) played tonight, you have to feel good that we have that
much depth.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when Tsyplakov was playing the previous two seasons, the
knock was he didn't shoot enough. At one point last year, he had
goals in four consecutive games, but the Russian system stresses
passing first and he is a master. When the club acquired Audette
last December and Palffy and Bryan Smolinski during the summer,
Tsyplakov could see he was being replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tough to watch, to sit in the press box as a scratch
even though nothing is wrong,'' he said. ``I know I can contribute,
but night after night it is the same thing. All you can do is work
hard and not lose your focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Focus was a problem for Straka and Werenka when Tsyplakov came
calling six minutes into the second. He deked Straka and kept the
puck, then slid it past Werenka and into open ice. Audette was
standing to the left of goaltender Peter Skudra, who never had a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might have been the most beautiful play for us this
season,'' Murray said. ``It is one we will be watching over and
over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg still struggles: Defenseman Aki Berg was on the ice for the
Penguins' first two goals and did not play much in the third
period. Berg was benched for mistakes that led to goals in three
games at home, including one last Thursday at the Staples Center
when Jagr muscled past him to score less than a minute into the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr did it again to Berg on Tuesday, during the first minute of
the second period. He blew by Berg and passed to Robert Lang in
front for a goal that tied the game at two.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were two tonight that weren't good,'' Murray said.
```(Berg) needs to get more consistent.''

SECURING UC ARMS LABS MAY COST MILLIONS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CHARLIE GOODYEAR 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ It will take $300 million to tighten slack
security at the nation's three top weapons laboratories, which have
been plagued by allegations of espionage, a new University of
California report said Tuesday.
<P>
   The committee that produced the report faulted management at the
labs for a ``complacent attitude regarding security'' and said
employees often aren't given clear guidelines on what information
needs to be protected.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, the normally super-secret laboratories,
operated by UC under contracts with the U.S. Department of Energy,
have been blasted in the press and in Congress for allowing foreign
scientists access to classified material and also for leaving that
very material on unsecured computers, easily vulnerable to hackers
outside the labs.
</P>
<P>
   The labs covered by the UC report are the Los Alamos National
Laboratory and the Sandia National Laboratory, both in New Mexico,
and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California.
</P>
<P>
   The report was issued by a special committee composed of retired
generals and other security experts, as well as physics and law
professors. It was headed by former Nuclear Regulatory Commission
Chairman John Ahearne. The committee was formed at the request of
UC President Richard Atkinson, who also urged the university to
become a leader in cybersecurity to ensure the safekeeping of
weapons secrets at the classified labs it administers.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Atkinson praised the committee for providing the
university and the labs ``with superb insight and guidance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The University of California has an unwavering commitment to
excellence in security, safety and science in its management of the
Department of Energy laboratories,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But despite that praise, neither Atkinson nor any of the eight
members of the committee charged with examining lab security would
answer questions about the report.
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante, a regent of the University
of California who has insisted on making lab security a top
priority, called the committee's report ``an important first step''
and said he expects the university will work to prove it can be the
best manager of the labs in Livermore and Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   The university has faced intense criticism and scrutiny since
March, when Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee was fired for violating
security rules.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, Lee has not been charged with a crime, and federal
investigators have found themselves a target for their alleged
sloppy handling of Lee's case. Since 1996, the FBI has been
investigating whether China stole nuclear warhead secrets from the
labs in the 1980s, but so far the agents have made no arrests in
connection with laboratory espionage.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the university disciplined three officials at Los
Alamos involved in Lee's case and hired a counterintelligence
expert to take charge of security at the labs it manages for the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings of the report issued Tuesday, the committee
recommended that a secure phone system should be installed in all
classified laboratory areas. It noted that a classified computer
system is so hard to use that it could encourage scientists to work
on unsecured computers. And many lab employees remain unaware of
the threats hackers pose to lab computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   The report also recommended that all phone and computer lines
linking the labs to Department of Energy headquarters should be
secure _ currently, many of these lines are no more secure than
those in the average house.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those shortcomings, the committee cautioned against the
widespread use of controversial lie-detector tests as a way of
improving security at the labs. The report noted that the
Department of Energy may have trouble finding enough qualified
technicians to administer the tests to thousands of lab employees,
as has been proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This committee is reflecting a lot of what it heard from
scientists at Livermore and Los Alamos and Sandia,'' said
university spokesman Rick Malaspina. ``There are concerns, and the
Department of Energy continues to develop the polygraph. This is
seen as a tool that the Department of Energy will use.''
</P>
<P>
   Malaspina said the university is creating a cybersecurity
research center drawing on work already being done at Berkeley,
Davis and Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   UC Regent Howard Leach said he was encouraged by the report,
saying ``the facts tell us there was a good security program'' in
place at the labs.
</P>
<P>
   But ``any program could be improved,'' Leach added. ``We want
this to be as good as it can be.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Ahearne, the committee members were Lew Allen,
former Air force chief of staff and former director of the National
Security Agency and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory; William R.
Frazer, a UC Berkeley physics professor and former UC senior vice
president who is acting chairman of the university's laboratory
advisory council; Andrew J. Goodpaster, retired Army general and
former supreme commander of NATO forces in Europe; Raymond Jeanloz,
a professor of geology and geophysics at UC Berkeley and a member
of the JASONS, a U.S. Department of Defense advisory group; Daniel
Simmons, a law professor at UC Davis and former chair of the UC
Academic Council; Francis Sullivan, director of the Center for
Computing Sciences at the Institute of Defense Analyses; and Rochus
E. Vogt, professor of physics at the California Institute of
Technology and former Caltech provost.

 40% OF U.S. DOCTORAL DEGREES IN '96-97 WERE EARNED BY WOMEN  &HT;     By TANYA SCHEVITZ 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   U.S. universities are awarding record numbers of Ph.D. degrees,
largely due to a staggering increase in the number of women seeking
graduate education, according to a new federal report released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Women earned 17,322 doctoral degrees in the 1996-97 academic
year, 40.6 percent of those awarded. That is an increase of 20
percent from five years before and of 52 percent from a decade
before _ and a seven-fold increase since 1967, according to a
report produced by the the National Opinion Research Center at the
University of Chicago for the National Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   While the number of men earning doctorates has remained constant
at about 25,000 per year during the past 10 years, the increase in
the number of women earning doctorates helped boost the total of
Ph.D.s given by the 382 universities that grant research doctorates
to 42,705 in 1996-97 _ an increase of 32 percent from 10 years
before, says the report, ``Doctorate Recipients from United States
Universities.''
</P>
<P>
   The annual number of men earning doctorate degrees rose by only
1,500 from 1977 to 1997. Yet the number of doctorates earned by
women rose by 9,500 per year in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not surprise me if within three to four years, women
would be the majority population among U.S. citizens getting
doctoral degrees,'' said the report's co-author, Allen Sanderson, a
research scientist at the center and economics lecturer at the
University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a societal point of view, it really suggests more of an
openness. It illustrates fewer barriers for what is an acceptable
career path for women,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If international students _ who tend to be male _ are factored
out, about 47 percent of doctorates went to women in 1996-97,
Sanderson said. Mary Dee Wenniger, editor and publisher of the
national publication Women and Higher Education, said women have
already overtaken men in earning bachelor's and master's degrees.
</P>
<P>
   She attributes it in part to the mantra repeated to women that
they need an education to get a good job.
</P>
<P>
   ``They believe it, and they figure if they get the education, it
is one thing they can eliminate to make for a more equal playing
field,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the largest increase in student enrollment in the past
15 years has been people going back to school, and that women are
leading the way.
</P>
<P>
   From 1970 to 1990, there was a 164 percent increase in students
25 or older enrolling in higher education. For women, the increase
was 477 percent, Wenniger said.
</P>
<P>
   Although women experienced the largest actual growth of any
category in the number of Ph.D.s, the report also shows a
significant increase in the number of doctoral degrees going to
minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   Minorities saw a gain of 39.8 percent from 1992 to 1997 and an
87.7 percent gain from 1987 to 1997, which Sanderson attributes
largely to affirmative action and an increased interest among
university faculty and administrators to woo undergraduate students
for further education.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Ph.D.s earned by Asian Americans doubled from 1987
to 1997 and rose by 73.2 percent for African Americans and by 66.6
percent for Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   However, 63 percent of African Americans and 46.2 percent of
Latinos received degrees either in the education or social science
fields, while Asians were concentrated in the sciences.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, women are now gravitating more toward
the sciences and less toward education and humanities.
</P>
<P>
   Although the increases in engineering and physical sciences are
not great statistically, Sanderson said women are making strides.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of engineering degrees awarded to women rose from
0.3 percent in 1967 to 6.5 percent in 1987 and 12.4 percent in
1997. In the physical sciences, the increase was from 4.8 percent
in 1967 to 22.1 percent 30 years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers are small, but those strike me as fairly
significant gains,'' Sanderson said. ``It starts back in middle
school with respect to more girls taking math and sciences and not
dumping out quickly. And women are now more likely to get a B.A.
degree in math or science.''
</P>
<P>
   Women have made more significant gains in the life sciences,
including biochemistry, molecular biology and sociology, Sanderson
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, 45 percent of the doctoral degrees in
life sciences went to women in 1997, up from 13.3 percent in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996-97, the University of California at Berkeley conferred
36.1 percent of its doctoral degrees on women, according to campus
analyst Judi Suicq &LR; . That figure rose to 37.6 percent in 1998-99.

   ``The news is good,'' said Eugene Garcia, dean of the Graduate
School of Education at UC Berkeley. ``It used to be the case that
you were either a nurse or a school teacher. In the past 20 or 30
years, there has been a significant change in which parents and
school teachers say, `Hey, women can be anything.' ''
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, UC Berkeley was the third-largest
producer of doctoral graduates with 759, trailing the University of
Texas at Austin, which awarded 787 degrees, and the University of
Wisconsin at Madison, which awarded 786 degrees. The University of
California at Los Angeles ranked seventh with 670 degrees awarded,
and Stanford ranked 10th with 591.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its size, California accounted for 11.5 percent of
the doctoral degrees awarded to men and women in 1997, leading the
nation with 4,912 Ph.D. degrees.

   Hearkening back to the era of Dickens and other serial
novelists, The New York Times Syndicate is offering for purchase
``Ain't Done Yet: A Newspaper Novel About the So-Called End of the
World'' _ 29 suspenseful installments, by ROY PETER CLARK, the
Poynter Institute senior scholar and well-known writing coach.
</P>
<P>
   The novel, set in St. Petersburg-Tampa, chronicles a burnt-out
investigative reporter on the trail of a cult, ``The Watchers,''
and its charismatic leader.
</P>
<P>
   The novel, commissioned as a millennium project by The New York
Times Regional Newspaper Group, is an exceptional
editorial/marketing opportunity that can start working for your
newspaper immediately.
</P>
<P>
   THE SPECIFICS ...
</P>
<P>
   _ It is a work of fiction designed especially for newspaper
readers.
</P>
<P>
   _ It is written to be read in short, digestible, six-minute
chapters.
</P>
<P>
   _ It is marvelously illustrated with line drawings by Limbert
Fabian, artist for the Sarasota Herald-Tribune and NYTRENG. The art
is available on NewsCom and the Wieck Photo Database.
</P>
<P>
   _ It combines an action-packed narrative with
spiritual/philosophical themes that make it a
holiday/turn-of-the-century special event _ a natural for
imaginative advertising sponsorships. (The novel ends minutes after
midnight, Jan. 1, 2000.)
</P>
<P>
   _ It can run for as long as a month, building readership, and
converting Sunday readers to every day.
</P>
<P>
   _ It can be posted on your Web site, as a sure-fire traffic
draw. There new readers can catch up with the narrative, or collect
all the chapters. The novel will also spark reader exchanges on the
Web, too.
</P>
<P>
   _ It can be distributed as an advertiser-supported giveaway at
newsstands, with two or three episodes as a lure to bring readers
to the newspaper series.
</P>
<P>
   _ It is accessible immediately.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best of all ... it is very affordable.
</P>

<P>
   Many children who are struggling to read could be helped by
wearing colored contact lenses. The finding supports a theory
linking dyslexia and other reading problems to distorted visual
perception.
</P>
<P>
   David Harris, a researcher at the Ultralase Clinic in Chester,
England, was intrigued by patients who told him that tinted lenses
prescribed to remedy poor color vision also helped their reading.
So he took 47 children and adults who had been diagnosed as
dyslexic, and fitted them with different colored lenses to find
which color made it easiest for them to read.
</P>
<P>
   All the volunteers were then given reading tests with and
without these lenses, and with lightly tinted ``placebo'' lenses
that they were told had been specially designed to help with
reading. On average, they read six words per minute faster with the
placebo lenses and about 12 words per minute faster with the most
effective colored lenses _ an improvement of about 15 percent
(Journal of the American Optometric Association, vol 70, p 629).
</P>
<P>
   Harris thinks the treatment could best help those who experience
visual distortions of print. ``They see words moving, or patterns
like snakes or rivers running through the text,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   One theory of how the lenses work, championed by John Stein of
the University of Oxford, is that dyslexia is caused by defective
nerve cells that form a pathway from the retina to the brain's
visual cortex. These cells respond most strongly to yellow-orange
light, so colored lenses may help by filtering this light. &QL;

   Males normally have one X and one Y chromosome, while females
have two Xs. Scientists thought a ``maleness'' gene, SRY, on the Y
chromosome orchestrates changes that make an embryo become male.
Embryos with two Xs can become normal males if they inherit a
misplaced copy of SRY on the X from their father.
</P>
<P>
   However, rare cases in which XX males have no sign of SRY in
their genomes suggested the gene may not be the master regulator of
male development after all.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Overbeek, who breeds transgenic mice at the Baylor College
of Medicine in Houston, found a strain that had more male than
female offspring. He found that the gene for tan coat color, used
to identify the transgenic mice, had inserted itself into DNA near
a known sex-determination gene called SOX9. The insertion set SOX9
free to express itself. While the SOX9 protein doesn't normally
appear in the gonad of female embryos, the transgenic XX embryos
had SOX9 protein in the same amounts as a male embryo. Overbeek
believes proteins that repress SOX9 in female mice could no longer
bind to it.
</P>
<P>
   So SRY's job in XY males is to block the repression of SOX9,
allowing male development to proceed. ``Males are just repressed
females, and females are just repressed males,'' says Overbeek. &QL;

   VYBORG, Russia _ The calendar pages have not stopped turning in
this factory town in northern Russia. But they may as well have
frozen solid a decade ago as far as the workers at the Vyborg Pulp
and Paper Mill are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   The workers have taken over the factory. Violent clashes with
government security forces have not moved them. Their demands are
plain: kick out the foreign investors, cancel plans to re-tool and
update the factory and put the mill back in the hands of the
government.
</P>
<P>
   In short, bring back the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has undergone dramatic changes since the wall fell in
Berlin a decade ago and the Soviet Union was dissolved in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia has been unable to re-invent itself since the ebb of
Communism. In part, it is because Russia _ the birthplace of the
Soviet state _ defined itself for most of this century as the
center of what was a vast Communist world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically it doesn't exist anymore, but mentally it is still
there _ the USSR,'' said St. Petersburg political analyst Leonid
Kesselman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is how we identified ourselves. But as soon as the Soviet
reality disappeared, our identity did, too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A measure of democracy exists today in Russia. Personal freedoms
unheard of during Soviet times are taken for granted _ free speech,
travel, and consumerism. The trappings of the global economy
abound: McDonald's continues to expand its restaurant outlets; the
roads are full of imported German and Japanese cars; the Nike
swoosh is as prevalent as the hammer and sickle ever was.
</P>
<P>
   So how are you going to keep them down on the collective farm
after they've seen MTV?
</P>
<P>
   Why aren't democracy and the free market unequivocally
successful and popular in Russia? And why would anybody want to go
back to a totalitarian system that limited liberties and controlled
the economy?
</P>
<P>
   The answers rest here in Vyborg, near the border with Finland,
and hundreds of depressed Soviet-era factory towns like it
throughout Russia. The people who work at the Vyborg Pulp and Paper
Mill have it bad compared to you and me.
</P>
<P>
   They live in a country whose economy and politics are rife with
corruption and unfair play. While some Russians have prospered,
most Russians have suffered under democracy, watching their jobs
disappear, their spending power plummet and the country's stature
as a superpower evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   They have reasons to be suspicious about foreigners or rich
Russians or just whomever it is who owns their workplace.
</P>
<P>
   The workers took over the factory here two years ago and have
refused to let the new owners in. The dispute turned bloody in
October when the owners, a British firm called Alcem (ironically,
it is reportedly majority owned by Russian investors) tried to
storm the mill with the help of 30 Russian government troops. Two
workers were wounded by gunfire and people on both sides of the
dispute were beaten in the melee. The stand-off ended the following
day and the impasse continues _ the workers hold the factory; the
owners are on the outside looking in.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an ideological background to this dispute,'' said
Konstantin Sholmov, a local newspaper reporter who covers the
plant. ``There is no reason for the workers to think that anything
would be worse under new owners. But for two years they have
convinced themselves that they should not let anyone in.''
</P>
<P>
   The sprawling mill is situated on the outskirts of Vyborg in the
town of Sovietsky, population 7,000 _ all of them dependant on the
factory economy. The mill employs 2,000 workers and supplies the
town with heat and electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The workers have been spurred on by local Communist Party
politicians, who Sholmov says, are simply exploiting their plight
to gain attention and seats in the national parliament, the Duma.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, with the plant essentially closed, few workers work
and the pay is skimpy _ no more than US$60 a month. When the
factory went private, the workers received 47 percent of the
shares. But most of those have been since sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't have bread at home and they weren't getting paid
so they had to sell their shares. From the beginning they've been
cheated,'' said Lyubov Yakusheva, a workers' leader who operates
from the administration offices of the mill.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government, she complained, ``has only the buyers'
interest, not the workers interest'' at heart.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   I didn't bother pressing the point: Why not give the new owners
a chance? Isn't a profitable plant, no matter who owns it, better
than the current poor stalemate? And how can Russia expect to
attract badly needed foreign investment and thus boost its economy,
if workers still lamenting the loss of the Soviet Union won't allow
it?
</P>
<P>
   It is widely assumed that Russia will never go back to the way
it was in the Soviet era. Russians enjoy their personal freedoms
too much.
</P>
<P>
   But since democracy arrived, too many Russians have heard too
many lies and seen too few benefits. The Berlin Wall fell 10 years
ago, but a new wall has gone up here in the minds of many suffering
Russians. The tools to breach that wall _ the rule of law, a
relatively clean political system and a fair economy _ seem far
away.

 &HT;    `Real thing': Real greedy trendsetter?
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ So you go into your favorite greasy spoon and
order a chicken-fried steak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hungry enough to eat these plastic flowers,'' you tell the
waiter, as you about halfway drool all over your shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That'll be $24.95,'' the waiter says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hold it, buster,'' you tell the waiter. ``The menu says
chicken-fried steak is $6.95.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, Scrooge, that's only for people who come in here
fed,'' the waiter says. ``The price goes up according to how eager
you are for groceries. You're getting off easy. If we can see your
ribs sticking out like one of those guys over in Bosnia, it's
$99.95.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like an unlikely pricing scheme, doesn't it? Not so fast.
If a new vending machine being tested by Coca-Cola ever hits the
streets, this sort of inventive greed could become a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Coke is working on a machine that will charge you more for a
soda pop in hot weather. In summer, when you are thirstier, the
price of a Coke would rise automatically with the thermometer.
</P>
<P>
   According to The New York Times, the technology to pull off this
holdup appears to be available thanks to a computer chip and a
temperature sensor.
</P>
<P>
   So I guess if a guy had just crawled across the Mojave Desert up
to a Coke machine, the price of a soda could conceivably rise to
several thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   What's next? An ATM machine that has a double or nothing button
on it? Press the double down button, and the ATM takes the entire
contents of your checking account, then pumps out a receipt that
says, ``Thanks. Better luck next time.''
</P>
<P>
   When the revolution starts, the people who thought up this Coke
machine will be the first ones to be lined up and shot.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are always ways to cheat the system. If Coke
comes out with a machine like this, the thing to do would be to
take up a collection at the office, buy a 20-pound block of dry ice
and leave it next to the machine.
</P>
<P>
   Just think how ugly it could get if other businesses decide to
use this sort of pricing technique.
</P>
<P>
   How about cab drivers working on Sixth Street setting up
Breathalyzers in their cars? The drunker you are at some club, the
more it will cost you for a safe cab ride home. Had five beers?
That's $20. Eight beers? The fare goes up to $39.95.
</P>
<P>
   You are at the supermarket in the ice cream aisle, and the bar
code on the Blue Bell Tin Roof container can detect that you have
just smoked a large doobie. The price of the ice cream goes from
$3.99 to $150.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say you go into a house of ill repute and you're ... well,
let's skip that example.
</P>
<P>
   The minister is going to conduct the service at your daughter's
shotgun wedding _ with a price set depending on how many months the
bride has been pregnant. He'll perform the nuptials for $50 if
she's in the first trimester, but if she's expected to offload
Junior in a couple of weeks, that'll be $100.
</P>
<P>
   The computer chip in the pay toilet can tell through its motion
detector that instead of moseying up, you have just bolted across
the street like Carl Lewis in the 100-yard dash. So the price of
opening the door shoots up from 25 cents to $359.95.

 &HT;    Potter's pouters puzzling
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The skeleton, perched on the roof of a
19th-century mansion, wore a witch hat and clutched a tattered
Oscar Wilde volume in his bony hands.
</P>
<P>
   Our hostess appeared in a quite convincing Bride of Frankenstein
costume, which she thought would double nicely, with a few minor
revisions, for Marge Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   It was, in other words, the best of all possible parties in that
best of all possible seasons for the imagination, Halloween.
Everyone had a good time, including a neighbor child who had
declined to come the year before. ``I don't go trick-or-treating,''
he explained at the time. ``I'm going to Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   You can always count on someone _ some adult, that is _ trying
to spoil the fun of Halloween, to find evil in the inventive,
menace in the magical.
</P>
<P>
   So I suppose it was only a matter of time before someone tried
to ruin Harry Potter for us. Parents in Columbia, S.C., have
persuaded the state's Board of Education to review whether the
runaway bestsellers should be allowed in the classroom. Now, the
Cincinnati-based Family Friendly Libraries (www.fflibraries.org)
has jumped on the bandwagon, attacking the books about the young
magician for their supposed occult themes, violent content and
anti-family bias.
</P>
<P>
   In place of Harry Potter, the group recommends a list of fine
books, but most are from the 19th century and almost none from the
second half of this century. Some are still widely read, such as
Charlotte's Web and Little Women and the Little House series.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing tears my son away from the TV quicker than the words,
``It's Harry Potter time.'' No telling what he'd say if I hollered,
``Time for Pollyanna!''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine many boys today _ let alone many girls _
checking out these titles: A Little Princess; Rebecca of Sunnybrook
Farm; An Old-Fashioned Girl; Little Lord Fauntleroy.
</P>
<P>
   And Pollyanna? ``I don't think I've ever seen a boy pick that
up,'' says Stephanie Bange, children's librarian for the
Kettering-Moraine branch of the Dayton and Montgomery County Public
Library.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a long time since any children's book has created a
Harry-Potter-sized buzz, among children and adults alike, Bange
says: ``A really good fantasy is hard to come by. The books are
well-written, the loose ends are tied up, and there's nice
character development.''
</P>
<P>
   What strikes one about reading the Family Friendly Libraries'
approved books is not how different they are from Harry Potter _ an
orphan _ but how much they have in common. The group chastised the
series because ``the traditional family is portrayed as striking
out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But Pollyanna was an orphan,'' Bange points out. Same with
Anne of Green Gables, and Mary in A Secret Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``And nobody makes a fuss about C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia
series, which are based on Christian theology, but there are also
witches and the dark side,'' Bange says.
</P>
<P>
   There are other elements familiar to classic children's
literature _ and, supernatural elements aside, will remind them of
their own lives. ``There's a lot of self-discovery that kids relate
to,'' Bange observes. ``Harry is kind of a Charlie Brown character,
an Everyman. Everyone feels isolated, different, and wonders, how
can I fit in?''
</P>
<P>
   The series is popular with ``reluctant readers'' as well as
bookworms, Bange says: `` For kids to find books that send them to
another world _ it sends me. That's why we're here, to make kids
into lifelong readers.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be Harry's greatest magic trick of all.

 &HT;    Elderly suffer from rising costs, complexities of health care
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ ``Everything sure was a lot easier when we had Dr.
Tracy.''
</P>
<P>
   I made this observation after reading aloud for the third time a
confusing paragraph in the thick packet of materials my mother was
supposed to read and sign to continue her health-care coverage.
</P>
<P>
   My mother can't read any of this confusion for herself since
age-related macular degeneration has stolen her eyesight over the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss Dr. Tracy,'' my mother said. ``I guess they don't make
doctors like Dr. Tracy anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Mother has a ``To Read'' box where she drops letters, catalogs,
notices, bank statements and other reading material.
</P>
<P>
   Because my brother often travels to Denver, he generally handles
Mother's ``To Read'' box.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's my turn. My heart sank when I spotted the fat,
oversized envelope from my mother's health maintenance organization
among the other items in her ``To Read'' box.
</P>
<P>
   I knew that a correspondence course in nuclear physics would be
easier to understand than whatever was in the fat HMO packet.
</P>
<P>
   On the outside chance that the earth would be destroyed by a
giant asteroid, I decided to save the HMO material for last.
</P>
<P>
   As luck would have it, the earth was not destroyed. I was forced
to read and attempt to understand the HMO material.
</P>
<P>
   The cover letter made it sound as though my mother had just come
into some great new fortune. Her HMO officials have been making
fantastic accomplishments holding down costs to increase her
benefits and services.
</P>
<P>
   What the HMO officials must have been saying, however, is
something like: ``If you don't like what we are going to do to you
in 2000, you should thank your lucky stars that it wasn't a lot
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   My mother and thousands of other seniors in Denver had signed up
with HMOs after being told that their Medicare would take care of
their HMO coverage costs.
</P>
<P>
   That was then, and this is now.
</P>
<P>
   Now this HMO _ and supposedly all others in the Denver area _ is
cutting back on benefits and coverage in nearly every category.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, coverage is being dropped altogether. In other
categories, coverage is being reduced while co-payments and fees
are increased.
</P>
<P>
   In my mother's case, every benefit not eliminated was reduced,
made more expensive or both.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, beginning Jan. 1, 2000, everyone electing to stay
in my mother's HMO will have to pay a monthly membership fee
similar to country club dues to ensure that her HMO officials can
continue to make fantastic strides in holding down costs to
increase her benefits and services.
</P>
<P>
   I do not know that these happy-face cutbacks, reductions and
price hikes are unwarranted. I do know that my mother and a lot of
her fellow Denver seniors feel they have been lured into situations
where they now are trapped.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors on fixed incomes who need the health care but cannot
afford the price hikes are really hurt since many doctors refuse to
see Medicare patients unless they are members of managed-care
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, my mother doesn't take many prescription drugs,
whose escalating costs have forced many seniors who have worked
hard their entire lives to go without food or other necessities.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Herbert A. Tracy was our family doctor. Since he was the
only doctor in town, he was every family's family doctor. He was
never too busy to take a phone call, day or night. He made house
calls when people were too sick to go to his office.
</P>
<P>
   He drove a Cadillac, lived in a big house and was respected by
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   But that was then, and this is now.

 &HT;    Surgery will help man lighten up, feel `complete'
 &HT;    By Sanjay Bhatt

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROYAL PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Ron Bovino once couldn't stop eating.
Four Big Macs. A large pizza. A plate of bologna-cheese sandwiches.
Yet he never felt full.
</P>
<P>
   Now people make fun of him for ordering from the children's
menu.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old man is 260 pounds lighter because he had his
stomach stapled three years ago and has since worked religiously to
shed the fat. But his labors have left him with 30 pounds of skin
hanging around his waist like a ballerina's tutu _ an unseemly
sight he hides under his pants.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, surgeons will remove Bovino's excess skin at JFK
Medical Center in Atlantis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm finally going to be complete,'' said Bovino. ``I
still see myself as fat. . . . It'll make me say I've finally
reached my goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing the skin will mark the end of Bovino's long battle with
obesity _ a condition that has become the nation's second-largest
cause of preventable death after smoking. Bovino went public with
his story to give credit to his doctors and the hospital, who have
agreed not to bill him for the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Bovino has always been heavier than his siblings, he said, even
though they eat as much as he. He weighed 250 pounds in junior high
school. Bovino lost some weight after trying liquid diets, but
returned to food bingeing eventually.
</P>
<P>
   When his wife, Kathleen, met him 14 years ago in upstate New
York, Bovino weighed 350 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bovino became stressed when he began helping Kathleen take care
of her two children, Jimmy and Colleen. Jimmy, 14, lost an eye as a
toddler to a tumor, and 13-year-old Colleen has cerebral palsy and
is quadriplegic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ate when I was happy, I ate when I was sad,'' Bovino said.
``As far as I'm concerned, it's like a drug addiction. . . . My
`full' was at Thanksgiving, when you're so full you're almost
sick.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple moved to Palm Beach County in 1994 because Colleen
couldn't take New York winters anymore. They got married here. He
put on another 125 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Bovino's weight approached 500 pounds in 1996, the
5-foot-10 man was in trouble. His blood pressure was spiraling out
of control. He developed sleep apnea, a life-threatening condition
where the body stops breathing.
</P>
<P>
   The former amateur kick boxer had to catch his breath when he
walked from his front door to his car.
</P>
<P>
   And he couldn't run around with his stepson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was dying,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Liem, 60, a general surgeon in Lake Worth, remembers
his first thought when Bovino came walking through his door. ``He
wouldn't live long,'' Liem said.
</P>
<P>
   Liem tested Bovino's physical and mental health. Other than his
largesse, Bovino had no other serious health problems, so Liem said
he was a good candidate for a gastric bypass.
</P>
<P>
   The $25,000 operation is startlingly straightforward: The
surgeon carves a small pouch out of the stomach and staples the
pouch shut. Then the small intestine is cut and stapled onto the
pouch.
</P>
<P>
   With his stomach shrunken to the size of two golf balls Bovino
no longer had the urge to eat as much.
</P>
<P>
   His stomach's capacity is at least 24 times less than before. So
the man who used to eat three trays of lasagna in one seating can
eat only one-quarter of an apple, instead of six, Liem said.
</P>
<P>
   And if Bovino tries to eat foods with refined sugar, such as ice
cream, his new plumbing punishes him with a mild, although
immediate, case of diarrhea, Liem said.
</P>
<P>
   Bovino lost 70 pounds in the first seven weeks after the
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Even when overweight, Bovino, a former firefighter, wasn't the
kind to sit around the house. About a year after his surgery, he
dove into a canal to search for victims of a car crash. He ended up
performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation on a 25-year-old woman
pulled from the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never have been able to do that if I hadn't lost
weight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He works out for two hours three times a week. His sleep apnea
is gone, his blood pressure is back to normal. And he can play with
his children, including 8-year-old Samantha, his daughter with
Kathleen.
</P>
<P>
   Both are keeping a close eye on Samantha's diet and weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're afraid it can happen (to her),'' Kathleen said. ``It's
in the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Once surgeons remove Ron Bovino's skin today, he will have lost
nearly 300 pounds in three years. Drs. Alan Pillersdorf and Luis
Vinas are performing the 3 1/2-hour operation.
</P>
<P>
   Bovino's insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield, initially considered
the skin-removal operation cosmetic and refused to pay for it,
Pillersdorf said. Pillersdorf argued that the operation, which will
cost more than $10,000, was medically necessary and got tentative
approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you saw him naked, you'd say, my God,'' Pillersdorf said.
``You'd say this isn't cosmetic. It's needed.''

   Bovino's insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield, initially considered
the skin-removal operation cosmetic and refused to pay for it,
Pillersdorf said. Pillersdorf argued that the operation, which will
cost more than $10,000, was medically necessary and got tentative
approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you saw him naked, you'd say, my God,'' Pillersdorf said.
``You'd say this isn't cosmetic. It's needed.''

 &HT;    These days, just how bad do you have to be to get canned?
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Do yourself a favor: Quit reading
Lonesome Dove for a minute and pay attention. And while you're at
it, hang up on your psychic pal and get your feet down off the
desk!
</P>
<P>
   That's better. Now, let's talk about job security.
</P>
<P>
   What makes you so sure you have any?
</P>
<P>
   True, the economy's booming, so it's not like there's a crowd
panting over that cubicle of yours. And yes, the company does have
a good deal invested in hiring, training and nurturing you _ not to
mention what it laid out to undeviate your septum.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, with all the employment-protection laws and court
cases, a boss can't just toss people out the door the way a boss
could toss before. You have the right to a warning, a notice, a
hearing, an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Don't you? You'd better click your way out of that online casino
game and read on.
</P>
<P>
   You are right about this much: It's hard to get fired these
days. Maybe harder than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think most companies are looking to get rid of
employees,'' says Bob Francis, president-elect of the Human
Resources Association of Palm Beach County, which has members from
200 local companies. ``Most companies try to correct behavior
first.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``most companies'' doesn't necessarily mean ``your
company,'' and even if yours is a model of progressive and
benevolent management, believe this: You can get fired, and it can
happen in less time than it takes to say, ``You'll hear from my
lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis, vice president for human resources of the AGES Group, a
Boca Raton company that sells aircraft engines and other parts,
offers these five ways to get fired in a flash:
</P>
<P>
   1) Deck someone.
</P>
<P>
   Even a half-hearted slap will get you a one-way escort to the
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Engaging in a fight with a co-worker is cause for immediate
termination,'' Francis said. ``Physically punching, accosting,
assaulting.''
</P>
<P>
   Simply getting loud and insulting (or obscene) probably won't
get you fired on the spot, Francis said.
</P>
<P>
   Probably?
</P>
<P>
   ``If the obscenities are racial, sexual, or violate the rights
of any other protected class, the company may be obligated to
terminate you,'' Francis said.
</P>
<P>
   About the only employees who aren't automatically in a protected
class these days are white men under 40. So if you have to insult
someone, look around for a 25-year-old white guy. But even that's
not risk-free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many companies have broadened harassment policies,'' Francis
said. ``Instead of just banning sexual harassment, you can't harass
anyone to the detriment of their work. If your company has that
kind of policy in place and you're harassing a 25-year-old white
guy, you could still be in violation.''
</P>
<P>
   So keep your hands to yourself and just be quiet.
</P>
<P>
   2) Get loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Just showing up blotto could do it, but probably wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most companies have a substance-abuse testing policy,''
Francis said. ``You train supervisors not to accuse people of being
drunk or drugged, but you identify behavior that indicates someone
is impaired and you get the employee to an independent lab to be
tested.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless the results are clear-cut, you may get a second chance,
along with the strong suggestion that you take advantage of the
company's employee assistance program. The same would be true if
the results showed you were numbed to the gills but you could
produce a prescription.
</P>
<P>
   It's essential, however, you resist the urge to bring pals like
Jack Daniels or Jim Beam to the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually consuming alcohol or any illegal substance while on
the job is enough to get you terminated on the spot,'' Francis
said.
</P>
<P>
   3) Steal something.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, it takes a while to make a theft case against an
employee. But not always. And when it's clear-cut, thievery can be
an immediate firing offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody picks up a computer and goes out the door and you
see them put it in their car, it's not difficult to establish
theft,'' Francis said.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of companies have security cameras, so it's no use sneaking
down the back stairs with the copy machine. Or a box of staples.
</P>
<P>
   4) Lie about work.
</P>
<P>
   Falsifying company documents probably sounds like the sort of
thing you don't have to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   You can understand why a sales-division chief might get the
heave-ho for reporting the company sold 42,869 cases of Sugar
Toasted Squid Flakes when the actual total was 38.
</P>
<P>
   But you're not responsible for anything of the sort _ are you?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're required to fill out a time sheet, that's a company
document,'' Francis said.
</P>
<P>
   What happens if you put a ``40'' in the hours-worked column even
though you took that long lunch to shop for a last-minute Arbor Day
present? See item 3 above.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's theft,'' Francis said. ``You're trying to steal money
from the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Think about that next time you add up your overtime hours. Or
your expense account.
</P>
<P>
   5) Just sit there.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, there are companies that don't want to pay
people who don't do their work.
</P>
<P>
   Do lousy work and you'll probably get a chance to do better. But
if you simply refuse to do the work the boss assigns, that's
insubordination _ and you're out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are few valid reasons for refusing to follow a direct
order,'' Francis said. ``You have to do it unless they're asking
you to break the law or to do something that would jeopardize
yourself or someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   What if it's something stupid?
</P>
<P>
   ``You can file a grievance or complain later,'' Francis said.
</P>
<P>
   What if it's worse than stupid? (''Smedley, come in here and rub
my feet!'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few employers would terminate somebody whose supervisor
gave them an outlandish order,'' Francis said.
</P>
<P>
   You probably already have a good idea whether your company is
one of those few.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most employers are reasonable, but some take the position that
you should just do what you're told,'' Francis said. ``They fire
people and no one challenges it because nobody really wants to work
in a place like that.''
</P>
<P>
   What if you do want to work in a place like that? What if all
you ask is a chance to remain employed _ even if it means staying
sober, honest, nonviolent and even downright obsequious _ until
that first Social Security check arrives?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just make sure your don't do anything you wouldn't be happy to
have your family read about in the newspaper,'' Francis said. ``If
not, maybe you shouldn't do it.''

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: In two takes.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it ever confirmed that the breast lump discovered and
self-treated by Dr. Jerri Nielsen in Antarctica was cancerous? I
don't know how she could have determined that for certain without
appropriate tissue sampling and testing.
</P>
<P>
   A: While Nielsen has continued to shy away from the media since
she was plucked from the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Research Center
on Oct. 15, she has confirmed that she has cancer and will undergo
treatment now that she's back in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen, 47, of Youngstown, Ohio, discovered the lump in June.
She had been treating herself with chemotherapy since July, when
biopsy equipment and a supply of chemotherapy drugs were dropped to
her in a risky flight. The supplies allowed her to perform her own
biopsy and begin self-treatment with chemotherapy. She then
e-mailed photographs of slide samples of the tumor to doctors in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At her request, no details of her diagnosis or condition were
released immediately by the National Science Foundation, which
operates the research station. But Newsweek, citing a foundation
source, reported that after Nielsen completed the first round of
chemotherapy, doctors advised her to begin a second round. That
fueled speculation that the lump indeed was cancerous.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Nielsen herself who put an end to the speculation
when she issued a statement released Oct. 19 by the foundation. In
it, she said simply: ``The diagnosis of breast cancer has been
confirmed and I will undergo treatment. My spirit is strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that singer Little Richard is a Georgia native.
Where was he born?
</P>
<P>
   A: Little Richard was born Richard Wayne Penniman on Dec. 5,
1932, in Macon.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If Hillary Rodham Clinton runs for the Senate from New York
and is elected, will she still get Secret Service protection as a
former first lady?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, unless she specifically chooses not to have it. Pete
Sepp of the National Taxpayers Union cited Title 18 of the U.S.
Code, section 3056, which states that any first lady of a former
president is entitled to Secret Service protection for the rest of
her natural life, unless she declines it.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Clinton were to serve one or more Senate terms and then
retire, she still would be entitled to the protection, Sepp added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do all players who participated in the World Series get
rings, or only those on the winning team?
</P>
<P>
   A: All players and full-time staff of the New York Yankees and
the Atlanta Braves will get rings. Each year, the winners, who are
the ``world champions,'' are given World Series rings, while the
losers receive League Championship rings (the National League
championship ring, in this year's case). There's no difference in
size or style. The rings will be presented next April.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand the wife of Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry having
lots of money. Who was she before she married Kerry, and what is
the source of her fortune?
</P>
<P>
   A: Teresa Heinz is the widow of Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.), who was
killed April 4, 1991, in a collision between his charter plane and
a helicopter over Lower Merion Township, Pa. The heir to the H.J.
Heinz food company fortune, he was one of the wealthiest members of
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Heinz married Kerry (D-Mass.) in May 1995. Three months
after they wed, Kerry was quoted as saying he wouldn't dip into his
wife's $675 million fortune to run for re-election the following
year if potential rivals also promised not to use family assets.
``But if someone else gets in with all kinds of personal money,
that's a different ballgame,'' he added. The Boston Globe had
reported that Kerry's wife's fortune had intimidated some potential
political rivals, which prompted him to make that statement.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Heinz _ she still goes by that name _ is chairman of the
Heintz Family Philanthropies and the Howard Heinz Endowment, which
are considered among the nation's most innovative philanthropic
institutions. She also is the creator of the Heinz Awards, an
annual program recognizing ``outstanding vision and achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Considering the apparent loss of oxygen in the Lear 35 that
crashed Oct. 25, killing golfer Payne Stewart and five others, are
there oxygen detection and warning systems in the cockpits of large
commercial airplanes?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Planes that fly above 12,000 feet are pressurized,
because the air at altitudes above that lacks enough oxygen for
anyone to breathe comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial airliners are equipped with audible cockpit warning
alarms that will sound when the loss of cabin pressure exceeds
pre-established limits, said FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen.
Within 5 seconds of hearing the alarm, crew members must put on
oxygen masks. At the same time, oxygen masks automatically drop for
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the reason for the Lear crash aren't yet known for
certain, but ``oxygen deprivation'' is one theory. The National
Transportation Safety Board has said its investigation will take
some time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Warren Buffett is reported to have bought a company,
identified only as ``a really good furniture company,'' in early
October. Can you provide the name and some detail about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Jordan's Furniture Co., the Massachusetts-based furniture
powerhouse, and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. announced on Oct. 11 that
they had signed a ``definitive agreement'' for the merger of
Jordan's Furniture with a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's Furniture was incorporated in 1928 by Samuel Tatelman
in Waltham, Mass. In the early 1970s, brothers Eliot and Barry
Tatelman _ grandsons of the founder _ took over the business,
bringing it from a company of eight employees to more than 1,200
currently. According to a news release about the merger, Jordan's
``sells more furniture per square foot than anyone else in the
U.S.'' Company spokeswoman Heather Copelas said Jordan's is
approaching a quarter of a billion dollars in annual sales, and
plans more stores in New England.
</P>
<P>
   One unique feature of Jordan's Furniture is the incorporation of
``shoppertainment'' within the stores, such as one location's
48-seat flight-simulator movie theater, and another store's Bourbon
Street re-creation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read the other day that Thomas Durden wrote the song
``Heartbreak Hotel'' for Elvis Presley. But on the radio, I heard
that the mother of Hoyt Axton wrote it. Which is correct?
</P>
<P>
   A: What was reported in the Oct. 22 obituary for Durden is that
he co-wrote ``Heartbreak Hotel'' with the late Mae Boren Axton of
Nashville. She was the mother of Hoyt Axton, who died Oct.26. The
book ``Popular Music 1950-59,'' subtitled ``An Annotated Index of
Popular American Songs,'' also lists Presley as a co-writer of
``Heartbreak Hotel,'' by the way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who received the proceeds from the auction of Marylin
Monroe's items?
</P>
<P>
   A: The proceeds went in several directions, according to
Christie's International, the auction house in New York where ``The
Personal Property of Marilyn Monroe,'' as the items were billed,
were auctioned.
</P>
<P>
   The actress left all her belongings to her acting coach, method
acting guru Lee Strasberg. His widow, Anna Strasberg, was the
consignor, selling the items through the two-day auction last
Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Two charities were involved, according to a Christie's
spokesman, who said Anna Strasberg would give the proceeds from all
the furs in Monroe's collection to benefit the World Wildlife Fund,
and all the books in her library to benefit Literacy Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's a standard buyers fee that every auction house
charges, the spokesman said, and that goes to Christie's: 15
percent of the first $50,000, and 10 percent beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder went to Anna Strasberg. The final sales tally:
more than $13.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm on a septic tank system and keep getting fliers saying
the tanks need to be emptied every three to five years. What do the
experts say? And do they have to be emptied at all?
</P>
<P>
   A: Septic tanks should be pumped out every five to 10 years,
advises Tony Tyson, an engineer with the University of Georgia
Extension Service. Over time, inorganic solids will build up in the
tank, and if you don't pump it out occasionally, the solids
eventually will fill up the tank and overflow into the distribution
field. When the solids get into the drain tiles, they clog up the
pores in the soil and the system backs up. This is a common cause
of septic system failure, Tyson adds.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When a president's term in office is over, does he continue
to receive full salary in retirement, or is it reduced?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's reduced. The president's salary while in office is
$200,000, although Congress has approved doubling it to $400,000
starting with the next president.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement pay of presidents _ currently $151,800 a year _
is equal to the pay for a Cabinet secretary, said Pete Sepp of the
National Taxpayers Union. Whenever the pay for a Cabinet secretary
goes up, so does the retirement benefit for a former president.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-presidents also get money for a three-member staff, as well
as an office, and franking and other expense privileges, Sepp
added. The expense accounts amount to between $450,000 and $650,000
a year, depending on where the ex-president wants to locate the
office.
</P>
<P>
   These benefits are for life, and ex-presidents get them
regardless of how long they were in office.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who came up with the slogan ``The City Too Busy to Hate,''
once used by Atlanta?
</P>
<P>
   A: The late Mayor William B. Hartsfield coined it, first using
it in an article in the late 1950s or early '60s, according to The
Atlanta History Center.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What is an ``enriched egg''? Is that an ordinary egg such as
those we buy at a grocery store, or something else?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's ``something else,'' an egg from a chicken whose feed has
been altered so it will produce eggs that contain more Omega-3
fatty acids than regular eggs. Enriched eggs are sold at
supermarkets under such brand names as Good News eggs and Eggland's
Best.
</P>
<P>
   Other foods containing Omega-3 include cold-water fish, sea
vegetables and algae, flaxseed and flax oil, walnuts, canola
oil,soy products and leafy greens.
</P>
<P>
   Omega foods support brain function and visual acuity. Omega-3,
in particular, protects the heart by keeping vessels pliable and
decreasing clotting. It also has been linked to decreased symptoms
of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of the iceberg that was reported to be
floating free above Antarctica? Where is it now? A: Designated
B-10A, it's between Antarctica and South America, and is drifting
to the east on the average of 6 nautical miles a day, said Jeff
Andrews of the National Ice Center in Washington. The National Ice
Center, a multi-agency operation, has been tracking the berg since
1992, when it first broke off the Thwaites Ice Tongue, part of an
Antarctic glacier.
</P>
<P>
   While B-10A continues moving slowly into warmer waters, smaller
icebergs are breaking off of it, but as of this week it's still
enormous, Andrews said. It measures 10 by 37 miles, and took a
research ship 12 hours, going at 10 knots, to circumnavigate.
</P>
<P>
   So where does ``B-10A'' come from? Iceberg names are derived
from the Antarctic quadrant in which they were sighted originally.
B quadrant is in the Amundsen/Eastern Ross Sea; the 10 means it's
the 10th iceberg the Ice Center has found in that quadrant. B-10 is
the ``parent'' iceberg from which B-10A formed.
</P>
<P>
   Photos of the iceberg, and charts tracking its location, can be
viewed online at the National Ice Center's Web site:
www.natice.noaa.gov/
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported that Hal Hovey, Ohio's former state finance
director, took his own life after deciding not to spend a lot of
money on unpromising cancer treatments. The article said he donated
$25,000 to establish the Hovey Fund to help young cancer patients.
How can we donate to it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Candler Foundation is administering the fund. Checks
should be made out to Candler Foundation, with a notation that the
money is for the Hovey Fund. Mail to: Candler Foundation, 5353
Reynolds St., Savannah, GA 31405.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know what the expression ``pushing the envelope'' means,
but where does the ``envelope'' part come from?
</P>
<P>
   A: It derives from aviation, alluding to the technical limits of
an aircraft's performance. The American Heritage Dictionary of
Idioms explains that on a graph, these appear as a rising slope as
limits of speed and stress are approached, and fall off when the
capacity is exceeded and loses control. Safety lies within these
limits, or ``envelope,'' and exceeding them exposes pilot and plane
to risk.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm reading ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,''
concerning Savannah antiques dealer Jim Williams, who shot and
killed a male hustler in 1981. Is Williams buried in Savannah? I've
never seen his grave site reported.
</P>
<P>
   A: Although Williams lived in Mercer House, the splendid
Italianate mansion in Savannah where Danny Hansford was shot, he is
buried in a country cemetery near Gordon, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Members of my Sunday school class want to send holiday
messages to American military men and women overseas. Will you
print the addresses?
</P>
<P>
   A: The first two lines of the address for all mail should read:
Any Service Member, Operation Dear Abby. For those in Europe and
Southwest Asia, add this line: APO AE 09135. For those in the
Mediterranean Basin, FPO AE 09646. For those in the Far East, APO
AP 96285. For those in the Pacific Basin, FPO APO 96385.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service will begin accepting this mail starting Nov.
15. After Jan. 15, the APOs/FPOs will close and the Postal Service
no longer will accept mail for these addresses. Only first-class
letter mail, 13 ounces or less, can be sent.
</P>
<P>
   If you wonder why Operation Dear Abby is part of the official
military addresses, here's the explanation. It all began in July
1985, when Dear Abby (Abigail Van Buren) received a letter from Mel
Hebert, a Marine stationed in Okinawa. He said many men and women
in the military are lonely, especially during the holidays, and
asked her to request that her readers write them. She did, and the
annual tradition was born. Tens of thousands of pieces of mail are
delivered each season as a result of the effort she started.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read that Jean MacArthur, widow of Gen. Douglas
MacArthur, lives at New York's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. How is it
possible for someone to be a resident there?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Towers at The Waldorf-Astoria has had extended-stay
residents since the hotel's inception on Park Avenue, said
publicist Lauren Halvorsen. In addition to Gen. and Mrs. MacArthur
(he died in 1964, but she still lives there), other famous past
residents have included Frank Sinatra and Cole Porter.
</P>
<P>
   Several mementos in the hotel left from some of the more famous
residents include the general's desk, which is in the Presidential
Suite, and composer Porter's piano, which is still played daily in
the Cocktail Terrace.
</P>
<P>
   Business people, world travelers and Manhattan enthusiasts
continue to call The Towers home, Halvorsen added. She cited New
York's skyrocketing apartment rents as one inducement for people to
live at the hotel, as well as having perks such as a private butler
and regular cleaning services.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I was in the Navy, I served aboard the aircraft carrier
America (CV-66). It was decommissioned in 1996. I heard that
someone is trying to turn it into a memorial. Do you know anything
about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mickey Allard of the America Carrier Veterans Association
reports that the USS America at present is in a shipyard in
Philadelphia. The veterans organization has just formed the Friends
of America, he said, and is in the process of trying to make a
museum or memorial out of the carrier. He added that anyone
interested in helping in the project can contact Albert Allard,
president of the USS America Association, at 757-484-8361 or by
e-mail at OldSalty1(at)aol.com; information also is available
online at www.ussamerica.org/
</P>
<P>
   Q: We're seeing more and more antibacterial products coming to
market. Can they damage home septic tanks?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not likely, said Tony Tyson, an engineer with the University
of Georgia Cooperative Extension Service in Statesboro.
</P>
<P>
   Septic tanks work because of bacterial processes, and killing
enough bacteria in the tank could disrupt these processes, Tyson
explained. But because the minimum size for a septic tank is 1,500
gallons, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to get enough of
any antibacterial cleaning product into the tank to cause any
appreciable difference in the process. For the same reason, even
chlorine bleach isn't likely to cause a problem, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I seem to remember that actress Janet Gaynor won an Academy
Award in the first year they were given. But I never see this
mentioned in articles about the history of the Oscars. Is my memory
faulty?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, it's not. Janet Gaynor indeed did win in the ``best
performance by an actress'' category in 1927-28 for her roles in
three films: ``Seventh Heaven,'' ``Street Angel'' and ``Sunrise.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that the Florida Lottery is changing from a
once-a-week Lotto drawing to twice a week. Do you have any details
about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, it's changing. The first drawing was Oct. 27 under the
new twice-weekly Lotto system. The new Wednesday night drawings, in
addition to the traditional Saturday night drawings, are expected
to have jackpots starting in the range of $3 million to $4 million,
according to Leo DiBenigno of the Florida Lottery Corp. Players
will be choosing six numbers out of 53 instead of six out of 49, as
before.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously that change lessens the chances of winning, but on the
other hand if a person does win, prizes in lower categories as well
as jackpots are expected to be higher. The biggest increase will be
in the 5-of-6 prize level, where the estimated average payout will
jump from a previous average of $1,300 to about $5,000, DiBenigno
said.
</P>
<P>
   Information: 850-487-7787.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is former Atlanta Braves pitcher Steve Avery doing these
days?
</P>
<P>
   A: Avery, who was signed as a free agent by the Cincinnati Reds
last Dec. 11, is on the disabled list, recuperating from
rotator-cuff surgery. It was the latest in a series of injuries
suffered by the left-handed pitcher, including a strained left
oblique muscle which put him on the Braves' disabled list in 1996,
and a strained left groin which put him on the Boston Red Sox's
disabled list in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A Reds spokesman said the team still has an option on Avery's
contract, but he declined to speculate on any long-range plans.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recent articles about the Earth now having 6 billion people
make me wonder: How many people die on Earth every day?
</P>
<P>
   A: The United Nations Population Fund estimated that about one
million people die each week. Based on that, the daily number is
about 142,857.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My son and I were watching the History Channel when the
subject of poison mustard gas came up. He asked if it's made from
mustard. Can you enlighten us about it, and the damage it does?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not made from mustard. Mustard gas, also called
dichlorodiethyl sulfide, is so called because of the mustard taste
it leaves on the tongue, according to The Dictionary of Modern War.
While some say it also has a mustardlike odor, others say it's
nearly odorless.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced by the German army in April 1917, ``mustard'' was
adopted quickly by other combatants in World War I and became known
as ``the king of war gases'' because of its persistence, horrific
effects, and the difficulty of decontamination.
</P>
<P>
   The oily, colorless liquid blisters the skin and damages the
lungs, often causing blindness and death. Because it's much denser
than air, mustard gas tends to concentrate in shell holes,
trenches, ravines and other low-lying terrain, precisely where
troops would seek shelter from direct-fire weapons. Once there, it
saturates the soil and contaminates food, clothing and any
equipment with which it comes in contact.

 &HT;    (EDS: In two takes.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it ever confirmed that the breast lump discovered and
self-treated by Dr. Jerri Nielsen in Antarctica was cancerous? I
don't know how she could have determined that for certain without
appropriate tissue sampling and testing.
</P>
<P>
   A: While Nielsen has continued to shy away from the media since
she was plucked from the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Research Center
on Oct. 15, she has confirmed that she has cancer and will undergo
treatment now that she's back in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen, 47, of Youngstown, Ohio, discovered the lump in June.
She had been treating herself with chemotherapy since July, when
biopsy equipment and a supply of chemotherapy drugs were dropped to
her in a risky flight. The supplies allowed her to perform her own
biopsy and begin self-treatment with chemotherapy. She then
e-mailed photographs of slide samples of the tumor to doctors in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At her request, no details of her diagnosis or condition were
released immediately by the National Science Foundation, which
operates the research station. But Newsweek, citing a foundation
source, reported that after Nielsen completed the first round of
chemotherapy, doctors advised her to begin a second round. That
fueled speculation that the lump indeed was cancerous.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Nielsen herself who put an end to the speculation
when she issued a statement released Oct. 19 by the foundation. In
it, she said simply: ``The diagnosis of breast cancer has been
confirmed and I will undergo treatment. My spirit is strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that singer Little Richard is a Georgia native.
Where was he born?
</P>
<P>
   A: Little Richard was born Richard Wayne Penniman on Dec. 5,
1932, in Macon.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If Hillary Rodham Clinton runs for the Senate from New York
and is elected, will she still get Secret Service protection as a
former first lady?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, unless she specifically chooses not to have it. Pete
Sepp of the National Taxpayers Union cited Title 18 of the U.S.
Code, section 3056, which states that any first lady of a former
president is entitled to Secret Service protection for the rest of
her natural life, unless she declines it.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Clinton were to serve one or more Senate terms and then
retire, she still would be entitled to the protection, Sepp added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do all players who participated in the World Series get
rings, or only those on the winning team?
</P>
<P>
   A: All players and full-time staff of the New York Yankees and
the Atlanta Braves will get rings. Each year, the winners, who are
the ``world champions,'' are given World Series rings, while the
losers receive League Championship rings (the National League
championship ring, in this year's case). There's no difference in
size or style. The rings will be presented next April.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand the wife of Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry having
lots of money. Who was she before she married Kerry, and what is
the source of her fortune?
</P>
<P>
   A: Teresa Heinz is the widow of Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.), who was
killed April 4, 1991, in a collision between his charter plane and
a helicopter over Lower Merion Township, Pa. The heir to the H.J.
Heinz food company fortune, he was one of the wealthiest members of
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Heinz married Kerry (D-Mass.) in May 1995. Three months
after they wed, Kerry was quoted as saying he wouldn't dip into his
wife's $675 million fortune to run for re-election the following
year if potential rivals also promised not to use family assets.
``But if someone else gets in with all kinds of personal money,
that's a different ballgame,'' he added. The Boston Globe had
reported that Kerry's wife's fortune had intimidated some potential
political rivals, which prompted him to make that statement.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Heinz _ she still goes by that name _ is chairman of the
Heintz Family Philanthropies and the Howard Heinz Endowment, which
are considered among the nation's most innovative philanthropic
institutions. She also is the creator of the Heinz Awards, an
annual program recognizing ``outstanding vision and achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Considering the apparent loss of oxygen in the Lear 35 that
crashed Oct. 25, killing golfer Payne Stewart and five others, are
there oxygen detection and warning systems in the cockpits of large
commercial airplanes?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Planes that fly above 12,000 feet are pressurized,
because the air at altitudes above that lacks enough oxygen for
anyone to breathe comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial airliners are equipped with audible cockpit warning
alarms that will sound when the loss of cabin pressure exceeds
pre-established limits, said FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen.
Within 5 seconds of hearing the alarm, crew members must put on
oxygen masks. At the same time, oxygen masks automatically drop for
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the reason for the Lear crash aren't yet known for
certain, but ``oxygen deprivation'' is one theory. The National
Transportation Safety Board has said its investigation will take
some time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Warren Buffett is reported to have bought a company,
identified only as ``a really good furniture company,'' in early
October. Can you provide the name and some detail about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Jordan's Furniture Co., the Massachusetts-based furniture
powerhouse, and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. announced on Oct. 11 that
they had signed a ``definitive agreement'' for the merger of
Jordan's Furniture with a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's Furniture was incorporated in 1928 by Samuel Tatelman
in Waltham, Mass. In the early 1970s, brothers Eliot and Barry
Tatelman _ grandsons of the founder _ took over the business,
bringing it from a company of eight employees to more than 1,200
currently. According to a news release about the merger, Jordan's
``sells more furniture per square foot than anyone else in the
U.S.'' Company spokeswoman Heather Copelas said Jordan's is
approaching a quarter of a billion dollars in annual sales, and
plans more stores in New England.
</P>
<P>
   One unique feature of Jordan's Furniture is the incorporation of
``shoppertainment'' within the stores, such as one location's
48-seat flight-simulator movie theater, and another store's Bourbon
Street re-creation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read the other day that Thomas Durden wrote the song
``Heartbreak Hotel'' for Elvis Presley. But on the radio, I heard
that the mother of Hoyt Axton wrote it. Which is correct?
</P>
<P>
   A: What was reported in the Oct. 22 obituary for Durden is that
he co-wrote ``Heartbreak Hotel'' with the late Mae Boren Axton of
Nashville. She was the mother of Hoyt Axton, who died Oct.26. The
book ``Popular Music 1950-59,'' subtitled ``An Annotated Index of
Popular American Songs,'' also lists Presley as a co-writer of
``Heartbreak Hotel,'' by the way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who received the proceeds from the auction of Marylin
Monroe's items?
</P>
<P>
   A: The proceeds went in several directions, according to
Christie's International, the auction house in New York where ``The
Personal Property of Marilyn Monroe,'' as the items were billed,
were auctioned.
</P>
<P>
   The actress left all her belongings to her acting coach, method
acting guru Lee Strasberg. His widow, Anna Strasberg, was the
consignor, selling the items through the two-day auction last
Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Two charities were involved, according to a Christie's
spokesman, who said Anna Strasberg would give the proceeds from all
the furs in Monroe's collection to benefit the World Wildlife Fund,
and all the books in her library to benefit Literacy Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's a standard buyers fee that every auction house
charges, the spokesman said, and that goes to Christie's: 15
percent of the first $50,000, and 10 percent beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder went to Anna Strasberg. The final sales tally:
more than $13.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm on a septic tank system and keep getting fliers saying
the tanks need to be emptied every three to five years. What do the
experts say? And do they have to be emptied at all?
</P>
<P>
   A: Septic tanks should be pumped out every five to 10 years,
advises Tony Tyson, an engineer with the University of Georgia
Extension Service. Over time, inorganic solids will build up in the
tank, and if you don't pump it out occasionally, the solids
eventually will fill up the tank and overflow into the distribution
field. When the solids get into the drain tiles, they clog up the
pores in the soil and the system backs up. This is a common cause
of septic system failure, Tyson adds.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When a president's term in office is over, does he continue
to receive full salary in retirement, or is it reduced?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's reduced. The president's salary while in office is
$200,000, although Congress has approved doubling it to $400,000
starting with the next president.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement pay of presidents _ currently $151,800 a year _
is equal to the pay for a Cabinet secretary, said Pete Sepp of the
National Taxpayers Union. Whenever the pay for a Cabinet secretary
goes up, so does the retirement benefit for a former president.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-presidents also get money for a three-member staff, as well
as an office, and franking and other expense privileges, Sepp
added. The expense accounts amount to between $450,000 and $650,000
a year, depending on where the ex-president wants to locate the
office.
</P>
<P>
   These benefits are for life, and ex-presidents get them
regardless of how long they were in office.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who came up with the slogan ``The City Too Busy to Hate,''
once used by Atlanta?
</P>
<P>
   A: The late Mayor William B. Hartsfield coined it, first using
it in an article in the late 1950s or early '60s, according to The
Atlanta History Center.

 &HT;    Caramel: You loved it as a kid . . . why not enjoy it again?
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The sweet buttery smell of warm caramel is
synonymous with the season. Just lift your head, breathe deeply and
conjure up the smells of those childhood treats of candy apples and
candy corn.
</P>
<P>
   But in the '90s, caramel has become an adult taste. Trendy chefs
love the idea of caramelized onions and scatter them like a garnish
all over the menu. The naturally sweet, soft, browned onions are a
favorite topping on pizza, often alongside blue cheese. Sweet and
salty caramelized nuts are scattered over salads. Even scallops and
salmon are sometimes called ``caramelized,'' which may indicate
that a little sugar was sprinkled on top to add to the browning.
And classically trained chefs caramelize beef bones as the timeless
foundation of a good stock.
</P>
<P>
   Whether we're talking candied apples or caramelized onions, the
savory principle is the same: sugars, either added or naturally
occurring, are heated until they brown, forming intense flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Before moving on to the caramel treats of the '90s, it's
worthwhile to master an old-fashioned caramel sauce, a decadent
staple that can keep in the refrigerator for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   For the home cook, the recipe for caramel sauce is just sugar,
usually dissolved in a little water, cooked until brown, then
enriched with cream. Sometimes, but not always, butter is added and
occasionally a touch of vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   So why is the list of ingredients on a store-bought caramel
sauce so long? The list usually starts with corn syrup instead of
sugar. Corn syrup has a distinctive flavor.
</P>
<P>
   So if you really like caramel, it's worth making at home. It is
easy, as long as you play by the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Here they are:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use a big, heavy-bottomed pot. When the cream is added to the
browned sugar, it boils up furiously and will foam over the top of
a small pan.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Stir the sugar and water once as the sugar dissolves, but not
after the water comes to a boil.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use a basting brush dipped in water to wash down any sugar
crystals that form on the side of the pot.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Toward the end of the cooking time, watch carefully. The sugar
syrup should be a rich, nutty brown. If it is too pale, the sauce
will be light in flavor as well. Scorched syrup will taste burned.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Warm the cream. Cold cream may cause the caramel to seize.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Be sure to wear oven mitts when you add the cream to avoid a
steam burn.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What is an ``enriched egg''? Is that an ordinary egg such as
those we buy at a grocery store, or something else?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's ``something else,'' an egg from a chicken whose feed has
been altered so it will produce eggs that contain more Omega-3
fatty acids than regular eggs. Enriched eggs are sold at
supermarkets under such brand names as Good News eggs and Eggland's
Best.
</P>
<P>
   Other foods containing Omega-3 include cold-water fish, sea
vegetables and algae, flaxseed and flax oil, walnuts, canola
oil,soy products and leafy greens.
</P>
<P>
   Omega foods support brain function and visual acuity. Omega-3,
in particular, protects the heart by keeping vessels pliable and
decreasing clotting. It also has been linked to decreased symptoms
of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of the iceberg that was reported to be
floating free above Antarctica? Where is it now? A: Designated
B-10A, it's between Antarctica and South America, and is drifting
to the east on the average of 6 nautical miles a day, said Jeff
Andrews of the National Ice Center in Washington. The National Ice
Center, a multi-agency operation, has been tracking the berg since
1992, when it first broke off the Thwaites Ice Tongue, part of an
Antarctic glacier.
</P>
<P>
   While B-10A continues moving slowly into warmer waters, smaller
icebergs are breaking off of it, but as of this week it's still
enormous, Andrews said. It measures 10 by 37 miles, and took a
research ship 12 hours, going at 10 knots, to circumnavigate.
</P>
<P>
   So where does ``B-10A'' come from? Iceberg names are derived
from the Antarctic quadrant in which they were sighted originally.
B quadrant is in the Amundsen/Eastern Ross Sea; the 10 means it's
the 10th iceberg the Ice Center has found in that quadrant. B-10 is
the ``parent'' iceberg from which B-10A formed.
</P>
<P>
   Photos of the iceberg, and charts tracking its location, can be
viewed online at the National Ice Center's Web site:
www.natice.noaa.gov/
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported that Hal Hovey, Ohio's former state finance
director, took his own life after deciding not to spend a lot of
money on unpromising cancer treatments. The article said he donated
$25,000 to establish the Hovey Fund to help young cancer patients.
How can we donate to it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Candler Foundation is administering the fund. Checks
should be made out to Candler Foundation, with a notation that the
money is for the Hovey Fund. Mail to: Candler Foundation, 5353
Reynolds St., Savannah, GA 31405.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know what the expression ``pushing the envelope'' means,
but where does the ``envelope'' part come from?
</P>
<P>
   A: It derives from aviation, alluding to the technical limits of
an aircraft's performance. The American Heritage Dictionary of
Idioms explains that on a graph, these appear as a rising slope as
limits of speed and stress are approached, and fall off when the
capacity is exceeded and loses control. Safety lies within these
limits, or ``envelope,'' and exceeding them exposes pilot and plane
to risk.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm reading ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,''
concerning Savannah antiques dealer Jim Williams, who shot and
killed a male hustler in 1981. Is Williams buried in Savannah? I've
never seen his grave site reported.
</P>
<P>
   A: Although Williams lived in Mercer House, the splendid
Italianate mansion in Savannah where Danny Hansford was shot, he is
buried in a country cemetery near Gordon, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Members of my Sunday school class want to send holiday
messages to American military men and women overseas. Will you
print the addresses?
</P>
<P>
   A: The first two lines of the address for all mail should read:
Any Service Member, Operation Dear Abby. For those in Europe and
Southwest Asia, add this line: APO AE 09135. For those in the
Mediterranean Basin, FPO AE 09646. For those in the Far East, APO
AP 96285. For those in the Pacific Basin, FPO APO 96385.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service will begin accepting this mail starting Nov.
15. After Jan. 15, the APOs/FPOs will close and the Postal Service
no longer will accept mail for these addresses. Only first-class
letter mail, 13 ounces or less, can be sent.
</P>
<P>
   If you wonder why Operation Dear Abby is part of the official
military addresses, here's the explanation. It all began in July
1985, when Dear Abby (Abigail Van Buren) received a letter from Mel
Hebert, a Marine stationed in Okinawa. He said many men and women
in the military are lonely, especially during the holidays, and
asked her to request that her readers write them. She did, and the
annual tradition was born. Tens of thousands of pieces of mail are
delivered each season as a result of the effort she started.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read that Jean MacArthur, widow of Gen. Douglas
MacArthur, lives at New York's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. How is it
possible for someone to be a resident there?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Towers at The Waldorf-Astoria has had extended-stay
residents since the hotel's inception on Park Avenue, said
publicist Lauren Halvorsen. In addition to Gen. and Mrs. MacArthur
(he died in 1964, but she still lives there), other famous past
residents have included Frank Sinatra and Cole Porter.
</P>
<P>
   Several mementos in the hotel left from some of the more famous
residents include the general's desk, which is in the Presidential
Suite, and composer Porter's piano, which is still played daily in
the Cocktail Terrace.
</P>
<P>
   Business people, world travelers and Manhattan enthusiasts
continue to call The Towers home, Halvorsen added. She cited New
York's skyrocketing apartment rents as one inducement for people to
live at the hotel, as well as having perks such as a private butler
and regular cleaning services.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I was in the Navy, I served aboard the aircraft carrier
America (CV-66). It was decommissioned in 1996. I heard that
someone is trying to turn it into a memorial. Do you know anything
about it?
</P>

   A: Mickey Allard of the America Carrier Veterans Association
reports that the USS America at present is in a shipyard in
Philadelphia. The veterans organization has just formed the Friends
of America, he said, and is in the process of trying to make a
museum or memorial out of the carrier. He added that anyone
interested in helping in the project can contact Albert Allard,
president of the USS America Association, at 757-484-8361 or by
e-mail at OldSalty1(at)aol.com; information also is available
online at www.ussamerica.org/

   Q: We're seeing more and more antibacterial products coming to
market. Can they damage home septic tanks?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not likely, said Tony Tyson, an engineer with the University
of Georgia Cooperative Extension Service in Statesboro.
</P>
<P>
   Septic tanks work because of bacterial processes, and killing
enough bacteria in the tank could disrupt these processes, Tyson
explained. But because the minimum size for a septic tank is 1,500
gallons, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to get enough of
any antibacterial cleaning product into the tank to cause any
appreciable difference in the process. For the same reason, even
chlorine bleach isn't likely to cause a problem, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I seem to remember that actress Janet Gaynor won an Academy
Award in the first year they were given. But I never see this
mentioned in articles about the history of the Oscars. Is my memory
faulty?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, it's not. Janet Gaynor indeed did win in the ``best
performance by an actress'' category in 1927-28 for her roles in
three films: ``Seventh Heaven,'' ``Street Angel'' and ``Sunrise.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that the Florida Lottery is changing from a
once-a-week Lotto drawing to twice a week. Do you have any details
about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, it's changing. The first drawing was Oct. 27 under the
new twice-weekly Lotto system. The new Wednesday night drawings, in
addition to the traditional Saturday night drawings, are expected
to have jackpots starting in the range of $3 million to $4 million,
according to Leo DiBenigno of the Florida Lottery Corp. Players
will be choosing six numbers out of 53 instead of six out of 49, as
before.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously that change lessens the chances of winning, but on the
other hand if a person does win, prizes in lower categories as well
as jackpots are expected to be higher. The biggest increase will be
in the 5-of-6 prize level, where the estimated average payout will
jump from a previous average of $1,300 to about $5,000, DiBenigno
said.

</P>
<P>
   Q: What is former Atlanta Braves pitcher Steve Avery doing these
days?
</P>
<P>
   A: Avery, who was signed as a free agent by the Cincinnati Reds
last Dec. 11, is on the disabled list, recuperating from
rotator-cuff surgery. It was the latest in a series of injuries
suffered by the left-handed pitcher, including a strained left
oblique muscle which put him on the Braves' disabled list in 1996,
and a strained left groin which put him on the Boston Red Sox's
disabled list in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A Reds spokesman said the team still has an option on Avery's
contract, but he declined to speculate on any long-range plans.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recent articles about the Earth now having 6 billion people
make me wonder: How many people die on Earth every day?
</P>
<P>
   A: The United Nations Population Fund estimated that about one
million people die each week. Based on that, the daily number is
about 142,857.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My son and I were watching the History Channel when the
subject of poison mustard gas came up. He asked if it's made from
mustard. Can you enlighten us about it, and the damage it does?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not made from mustard. Mustard gas, also called
dichlorodiethyl sulfide, is so called because of the mustard taste
it leaves on the tongue, according to The Dictionary of Modern War.
While some say it also has a mustardlike odor, others say it's
nearly odorless.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced by the German army in April 1917, ``mustard'' was
adopted quickly by other combatants in World War I and became known
as ``the king of war gases'' because of its persistence, horrific
effects, and the difficulty of decontamination.
</P>
<P>
   The oily, colorless liquid blisters the skin and damages the
lungs, often causing blindness and death. Because it's much denser
than air, mustard gas tends to concentrate in shell holes,
trenches, ravines and other low-lying terrain, precisely where
troops would seek shelter from direct-fire weapons. Once there, it
saturates the soil and contaminates food, clothing and any
equipment with which it comes in contact.

   ASK-A-DIETITIAN: Venison is a lean, healthy choice
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is venison really as low in fat as some people say?
</P>
<P>
   A: The recommended 3-ounce serving (the size of a deck of cards)
of venison (deer meat) contains 2.7 grams of fat (including 1 gram
of saturated fat) and 95 milligrams of cholesterol. That means it's
low enough in fat and saturated fat to meet the legal requirements
to be called ``extra lean,'' but its cholesterol content is a bit
higher than the 81 milligrams that would be allowed in that
portion. Despite the technicality, it's an appropriate choice to
include in a healthy low-fat diet. Remember that most people's
blood cholesterol level is influenced far more by the amount of
saturated fat they consume than the amount of cholesterol itself in
food.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a problem with getting up in the middle of the night
to eat. I don't know why I do it and I don't know how to stop.
</P>
<P>
   A: Some people who have this problem eat because they wake up
with strong hunger signals. Perhaps you need an evening snack. If
your dinners tend to be small or mainly grain products like rice or
pasta and vegetables, which are metabolized within only a few
hours, you might find the problem solved with more substantial
dinners that include meat, dairy or bean protein and a moderate
amount of fat. Discuss this situation with your doctor, especially
if you or others in your family have diabetes, because it could be
your blood sugar dropping too low in the night.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some people's night eating is a reflection of
troubling emotional circumstances. People who use food to cope with
stress and emotions are most vulnerable to this problem. Talk to a
therapist or registered dietitian trained to work with eating
disorders to help you resolve this problem.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is honey better than sugar?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. While you sometimes read that honey contains minerals and
vitamins not found in sugar, the amounts are so tiny that you would
have to be using huge amounts of honey for it to make a difference.
In equal amounts, honey is about 30 percent higher in calories, but
since honey is sweeter than sugar, you can use less honey for equal
sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm confused over conflicting reports that say weight control
is vital while others say that we are not all meant to fit in the
``ideal'' weight charts.
</P>
<P>
   A: Studies show a clear association between being significantly
overweight and having high blood pressure (a major risk factor for
heart disease and stroke), sleep apnea (a serious condition in
which breathing is impaired while sleeping), and osteoarthritis of
the knees, hips and lower back.
</P>
<P>
   Being overweight doubles someone's chance of developing the most
common type of diabetes. And obesity also increases the risk of
uterine cancer, and probably cancers of the breast, colon, rectum,
gall bladder and kidney.
</P>
<P>
   What is unclear is how we should define ``ideal'' weight.
However, since many very overweight people are unlikely to reach
and permanently maintain a weight anywhere near the charts of
recommended weights, perhaps setting ``ideal'' weights is not as
important as some people think. Studies show that those who are
overweight can improve their health by losing as little as 10 to 20
pounds (and keeping it off).
</P>
<P>
   So rather than worrying about whether it is OK to be overweight,
the more important issue may be to look at your lifestyle. Choose
healthy foods and portion sizes and be physically active every day.
</P>
<P>
   Ask a Dietitian questions were answered by Karen Collins, M.S.,
R.D. of the American Institute for Cancer Research.

   &QR;  This time of year the ads are full of carmel apples and corn.
But there's no such thing.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how we pronounce it, it's ``caramel,'' not ``carmel.''
</P>
<P>
   Just look in the dictionary. You won't find carmel. Only
caramel. And to be perfectly correct, it's pronounced CARE-ah-mel.

 &HT;    Versatile caramel always decadent
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The richest caramel sauces include butter as well as cream,
which is OK if you're drizzling it on in moderation. This
decadently rich version is from the new Spago Chocolate by Mary
Bergin and Judy Gethers (Random House, $35).
</P>
<P>
   Drizzle it over ice cream, apple tarts and cakes.
</P>
<P>
   RICH CARAMEL SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Makes 2 cups
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 cups granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup water
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups whipping cream, heated
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons room-temperature, unsalted butter, cut into pieces
</P>
<P>
   In a deep, heavy saucepan, combine the sugar and water and cook,
over moderate heat, until the mixture becomes a golden brown, about
15 to 20 minutes. After 10 minutes of cooking, watch carefully to
prevent burning.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the saucepan from the heat. Wearing oven mitts on both
hands, immediately add the cream, stirring with a long-handled
wooden spoon until smooth. Add the butter to the sauce and allow to
melt, then stir to combine thoroughly. Strain through a fine-mesh
strainer into a heatproof bowl.

</P>
<P>
   These little apple tartlets were inspired by a recipe in a
current cookbook. The recipe had numerous flaws, but I liked the
easy approach and tinkered with it until it worked.
</P>
<P>
   There are best served while still warm. For delightful excess,
top with whipped cream or ice cream and dribble the caramel sauce
on top. Or skip the cream and just spoon the caramel sauce on the
top of the warm tarts. Use the recipe above, or the somewhat lower
calorie/lower fat one below.
</P>
<P>
   CARAMEL APPLE TARTLETS
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed according to package
instructions
</P>
<P>
   1 egg
</P>
<P>
   3 Golden Delicious apples, peeled, cored and sliced very thin
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter, cut into bits
</P>
<P>
   whipped cream or ice cream, optional
</P>
<P>
   Caramel sauce (see recipe below)
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Roll the pastry out on a lightly floured board to a
14-by-12-inch square. Cut four circles about 6 inches in diameter.
Scout your kitchen for any suitable sharp-edged piece of equipment.
A biscuit cutter is too small, but you can make do with it and just
make more.
</P>
<P>
   Beat the egg with 1 tablespoon water and brush on the pastry
circles. Arrange the apple slices in an overlapping pattern on each
pastry circle. Sprinkle with sugar and dot with the butter.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for 20 to 25 minutes until the pastry is browned and cooked
through. If it looks too pale, run under the broiler for a minute
or two, watching carefully so the tarts don't burn.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer to individual plates. Spoon on whipped cream or ice
cream, if using, and drizzle with caramel sauce.
</P>
<P>
   A slightly more guilt-free caramel sauce dispenses with the
butter and adds a touch of vanilla for flavor. This recipe is from
the new Bake It to the Limit by Dede Wilson (Morrow, $30).
</P>
<P>
   CARAMEL SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   1 cup whipping cream
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup water
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   Heat the cream and set aside, keeping warm.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the sugar and water in a 3-quart, heavy-bottomed pan.
Stir to dissolve the sugar, then cook, without stirring, over
medium-low heat until the syrup begins to color. Wash down the
sides of the pot once or twice with a damp pastry brush to dissolve
any crystals that form.
</P>
<P>
   When the syrup is a medium amber color, remove the pot from the
heat. Wearing oven mitts, carefully pour in the warm cream. The
mixture may bubble up furiously. Whisk until smooth.
</P>
<P>
   When done, remove pan from heat and stir in the vanilla. If the
sauce is too thick, thin it with a little warm cream.
</P>
<P>
   Approximate nutritional analysis per 2-tablespoon serving: 133
calories, 7.3 g fat, 27 mg cholesterol, 8 mg sodium.
</P>
<P>
   Caramelized nuts, usually English walnuts or pecans, are
sometimes scattered over mesclun salads in contemporary
restaurants, along with a sprinkling of crumbled blue cheese. The
nuts are easy to do ahead of time. Double the recipe and keep some
on hand in a tightly sealed tin.
</P>
<P>
   CARAMELIZED WALNUTS
</P>
<P>
   Makes enough for 4 salads
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup English walnuts
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon fine salt
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoon walnut oil
</P>
<P>
   coarse Kosher or sea salt
</P>
<P>
   Toast the nuts in a 350 degree oven for about 10 minutes. Set
aside to cool.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the sugar, salt, oil and toasted walnuts in a small
nonstick skillet and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until the
sugar caramelizes and the nuts are coated. Pour onto foil,
sprinkling lightly with coarse salt and cool. Break the nuts apart
before using.
</P>
<P>
   Available at upscale supermarkets and specialty stores. This oil
is expensive. Buy in a small container because it turns rancid
fairly quickly. If unable, just use olive oil.

</P>
<P>
   If caramelized onions sounds like some kind of weird candy, just
realize that this just refers to onions that have been cooked long
and slow until they are tender and golden brown. The browning
simply intensifies the natural sugars in onions.
</P>
<P>
   These can keep in the refrigerator for several days, so make
them ahead and use them on pizza. Instead of traditional pizza
cheese, use crumbles of blue cheese. The saltiness of the cheese
pairs well with the sweet onions.
</P>
<P>
   CARAMELIZED ONIONS
</P>
<P>
   Makes enough for one large pizza
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds thinly sliced yellow onions
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   In a deep, heavy-bottomed pan (not aluminum or cast iron) warm
the olive oil and onions and slowly cook them, stirring regularly,
until golden brown. Stir from the bottom up so none of the onions
burn. It may take 20 to 25 minutes to completely brown the onions.
</P>
<P>
   Season with salt and pepper. Refrigerate if not using within an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Approximate nutritional analysis per serving:7 calories, 5.2 g

</P>
<P>
   Caramelized onions also show up as a garnish. In this recipe
from Mark Peel and Nancy Silverton at Home (Warner, $29.95), red
onions are cut opened and caramelized in the oven with balsamic
vinegar, which adds its own sweetness. Serve these as an
accompaniment to grilled meat.
</P>
<P>
   CARAMELIZED RED ONIONS
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   3 medium red onions
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Cut each onion into sixths,
leaving the root end attached.
</P>
<P>
   In a nonstick ovenproof pan, heat the olive oil over high heat.
Place the onion wedges cut side down and brown on one side.
Sprinkle with the balsamic vinegar. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes until
the juices in the pan are dark and syrupy. These can be served
immediately or cooled and served at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Approximate nutritional analysis per serving: 71 calories, 4.6 g
fat, 0 cholesterol, 2 mg sodium.
</P>
<P>
   Caramelized bacon has been around for year as a Southern brunch
item. In this dish, added sugar provides the caramel taste.
</P>
<P>
   CARAMELIZED BACON
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 servings
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups packed golden brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 pound bacon (not thick-sliced)
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Place sugar in a shallow pan. Add strips of bacon to the pan and
turn to coat both sides with sugar. Transfer to a rack over a
rimmed baking sheet, or use a large broiler pan.
</P>
<P>
   Bake the bacon until dark golden brown, turning once, about 8
minutes per side. Using tongs transfer to a rack to cool. Serve at
room temperature.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Cooking the cowboy way
 &HT;    (ATTENTION: TEXAS EDITORS. Runs with COWBOY-RECIPES.)By Kitty
Crider
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ From Alpine to Fort Worth to Hollywood, cowboy
chef Grady Spears is making a trail. And with his down-home _
sometimes uptown _ food and friendly, ``aw-shucks, ma'am'' manner,
he draws a crowd faster than a barroom brawl.
</P>
<P>
   When Central Market in Austin offered his cooking class this
summer, it sold out more quickly than any other in the school's
history. As the waiting list grew and grew, Spears offered to
return on his vacation and teach two more. People loved him for it
and sneaked off from work, telling their bosses they had doctor's
appointments, to attend. Others closed their businesses and drove
several hours from Victoria and other towns to see this young Texan
stir up chicken chile rellenos, cow camp corn, or apple crisp with
cajeta.
</P>
<P>
   His cowboy cuisine is homey with occasional trendy sun-dried
tomato twists. His Reata restaurants in Alpine and Fort Worth are
happening places, and, in January, he has a third scheduled to open
on Rodeo Drive in that tony 90210 ZIP code, complete with a cattle
drive. This weekend he is coming back to Austin for yet another
event,the Texas Book Festival, as one of the cookbook authors being
spotlighted with two panels, a tasting and book signings. Spears
and former Austinite Robb Walsh are the co-authors of ``A Cowboy in
the Kitchen'' (Tenspeed, $29.95), the story of how this
self-described redneck became one of the hot chefs of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back when I was punching cows, if you'd told me I was going to
be a chef someday, I would have doubled up in laughter and fallen
off my horse,'' Spears says in the introduction of the book.
</P>
<P>
   A boots-and-jeans kind of guy, he grew up in Granbury, just
outside Fort Worth. He worked in the stockyards in high school and
never thought he would be anything but a cowboy.
</P>
<P>
   A scholarship took him to college, but he hated it. So, at 19,
he quit and went to work as a ranch cattle buyer. Not successfully,
however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess those old-timers got the best of me. I was paid on
commission, and I didn't earn diddly-squat. In fact, I was
starving. I remember going a whole week eating nothing but
cereal,'' he recalls in his book.
</P>
<P>
   Hunger was the influence in his culinary career, not his mom's
cooking. (Apparently the kitchen is not her strength. ``My mom just
bought a convection oven. That's like putting a gun in a child's
hand,'' he explains.) He discovered cooking on his own when his
belly-growling hunger drove him to take a second job as a
restaurant busboy. His plan was to get free food as well as some
extra bucks. Then a waiter quit, and he moved up. He discovered he
could make more money as a waiter than a cowboy. So long, saddle.
</P>
<P>
   In a strange twist for a cattleman, his next move was to manage
a vegetarian restaurant in Houston. When he was approached about
managing a restaurant at the Gage Hotel in Marathon, he went west
to check out the situation and fell in love with the deserts and
canyons, the sparse population and the time warp where old Texas
traditions are still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was great, he says, except the cook hated him and
walked out in the middle of Saturday night dinner, leaving a full
dining room of hungry guests. Spears grabbed a skillet and started
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   When he couldn't find a replacement chef, he took over the job.
But he thought the steak/burger menu was pretty boring and decided
to update it for the increasing number of tourists coming through
the area. His efforts were hampered by the fact that Marathon has
no supermarkets, butchers, bakeries or dairies. He talked local
gardeners into growing fresh produce for him. He hired cowboy cooks
to help him with catering jobs. He watched and listened and learned
from them the secrets of Old West cooking. And the Gage's food rep
grew.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he opened Reata, his own restaurant in an old house in
Alpine, also in West Texas. That summer some movies were filmed
around the area, and a lot of the stars and Hollywood folks
discovered Reata. The next thing he knew Reata's West Texas cowboy
cuisine was being written up in Martha Stewart Living and other
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   A Fort Worth banker talked Spears into opening a second Reata.
Spears hired some talented chefs to run the Fort Worth kitchen and
learned from them, just as he had the ranch cooks. They taught him
what a mandolin is (the French slicing gizmo, not a musical
instrument) and helped him expand the menu. It was a good match for
the Stockyard City. He says many of the recipes in his cookbook are
the result of those collaborations.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the gutsiest rodeo event of his life. While many
nationally known restaurants are heading to Las Vegas, Spears is
taking the Reata concept and menu to Beverly Hills. Don't start
humming: ``Come listen to my story about a man named Spears . . .''
yet. He and his partners are convinced there are a ton of
meat-eaters and Texans in movieland. And he grins at the thought of
the rich and skinny chowing down on his chicken fried steak. He
really, really likes that mental picture. But can he tempt Jennifer
Aniston to go CFS?
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Hollywood locals will frequent it remains to be
seen. But the California Restaurant Association says such an eatery
may do well in Beverly Hills because the area has a big tourist
economy, and there are waits at Hollywood steakhouses. Just like
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how many women eat chicken fried steak in Texas.
Calf fries, too,'' he says. He thinks he will find the same on
Rodeo Drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't . . . I'm in trouble,'' he says with a shrug.
``I'm packing up and coming home.''
</P>
<P>
   He's got more on his steak plate. Coming out in February is
another cookbook, ``Cowboy Cocktails'' (10 Speed Press), co-written
with Brigit Binns of Los Angeles. He's also contributed some 20 to
30 recipes to the next Dallas Cowboys wives benefit cookbook. He's
just started ``The Great Steak Cookbook.'' And he's hoping to begin
filming in the spring on a 26-show PBS series ``A Cowboy in the
Kitchen,'' that will draw from several of his cookbooks.

   JALAPENO SOUP
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   5 jalapeno peppers, stemmed and seeded
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup finely chopped red onion (about 1/2 large onion)
</P>
<P>
   3 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 avocado peeled and diced
</P>
<P>
   2 cups diced tomatoes (2 large tomatoes)
</P>
<P>
   8 cups of heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch cilantro, stemmed and chopped
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Mince jalapenos and set aside. In a large, heavy saucepan, heat
the butter over medium heat. Add the jalapenos, onions and garlic
and saute, stirring, until the vegetables are soft. Remove the pan
from the heat and stir in the avocados, tomatoes and cream. Lower
the temperature and return the pan to the heat, watching and
stirring so the cream does not separate. Bring the soup slowly back
to a simmer and cook for about 30 minutes to reduce by one third
and to blend the flavors. Be sure to stir the soup occasionally to
prevent sticking or scorching. Season with salt and pepper. Just
before serving, stir the chopped cilantro leaves into the soup,
reserving some for garnish. Ladle soup into bowls and garnish with
remaining cilantro. Serves 6.
</P>
<P>
   Corn bread, also known as corn pone, johnnycake and yaller bread
was always more common than sourdough down in South Texas. Cowboys
there liked to eat their yaller bread with molasses and frijoles.
This one already has the frijoles in it.
</P>
<P>
   YALLER BREAD WITH PINTOS
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups buttermilk
</P>
<P>
   3 eggs, slightly beaten
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup Ranch Beans
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup fresh corn kernels
</P>
<P>
   1 cup flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups fine yellow cornmeal
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup melted butter
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the buttermilk, eggs, sugar and soda and mix well. Add
the beans and the corn. Sift together the flour, salt and cornmeal.
Slowly add the flour mixture to the liquids, whisking until well
incorporated. Whisk in the melted butter. Pour the batter into a
greased 8-by-11-inch pan or 10-inch cast-iron skillet and bake for
40 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. Makes 8 large
squares.
</P>
<P>
   People like their beans without a lot of frills in West Texas.
Serve these with cole slaw and Yaller Bread with Pintos for a
cowboy version of a health-food lunch.
</P>
<P>
   RANCH BEANS
</P>
<P>
   4 cups dried pinto beans
</P>
<P>
   4 cups minced yellow onions plus 1 1/2 cups diced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup pure chile powder
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 bunch cilantro, stemmed and chopped
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 cups diced red bell pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 cups diced green bell pepper
</P>
<P>
   Wash the beans and sort through them to remove any foreign
particles and broken beans. In a stockpot, cover the beans with
cold water by 6 inches and and soak them for 6 hours, or overnight.
Be sure the beans remain covered with water during the soaking
process.
</P>
<P>
   Drain the beans and return them to the same pan. Cover them with
fresh water by 1 1/2 inches. Add the minced onions, chile powder,
salt and cilantro and stir to blend. Bring the beans to a boil over
medium heat. Reduce heat, cover, and cook until the beans are
tender, about 2 1/2 hours. From time to time heck and stir the
beans. If necessary, add water as needed. Near the end of the
cooking time the liquid should be almost absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   Close to serving time, heat the olive oil in a large saute pan.
When the oil is very hot, add the diced onion and peppers and cook
them quickly, about 6 minutes, stirring and tossing, until crisp
but tender. Stir this mixture into the beans. Serve at once. Serves
10.
</P>
<P>
   Catfish Cakes
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds boneless, skinless catfish fillets, cut into 1-inch
dice
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup finely shopped red onion
</P>
<P>
   1 jalapeno pepper, stemmed, seeded, and minced
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup finely diced red bell pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup thinly sliced chives
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup minced cilantro leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups fresh or dried white bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs, lightly beaten
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon lime zest
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups peanut oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup flour
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the catfish,
onion, peppers and garlic. Saute until the vegetables are wilted
and the catfish is cooked through, about 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, combine the cooked fish and vegetables,
mayonnaise, chives, cilantro, mustard, crumbs, eggs, zest, salt and
pepper. Form the mixed ingredients into 10 3-ounce patties. Pack
the mixture fairly tight so it will stay together while cooking.
Set aside on a plate.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the peanut oil in a pan until smoking slightly. Dust each
cake with flour and gently slip into the hot oil. Fry the cakes for
approximately 2 minutes on each side or until they are golden
brown. Do not crowd the cakes; it is better to cook in batches.
Remove the cakes and drain them on a paper towel-lined pan. Serve
hot. Makes 10 3-ounce cakes.
</P>
<P>
   At Reata we use this on portobello mushroom sandwiches and our
chicken burritos, but it works fine on pasta.
</P>
<P>
   SUN-DRIED TOMATO-GOAT CHEESE PESTO
</P>
<P>
   15 sun-dried tomato halves
</P>
<P>
   5 teaspoons roasted garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 jalapeno pepper, stemmed and seeded
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup soft goat cheese
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup (packed) fresh spinach leaves, stemmed
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Place the sun-dried tomatoes in a bowl and pour boiling water
over them. Let them sit for 10 to 15 minutes to rehydrate. Drain
well.
</P>
<P>
   Put the garlic, jalapeno, goat cheese, spinach and drained
tomatoes in food processor and puree. With the motor running, pour
the oil through the feed tube in a steady stream until well
blended. Remove the pesto from the bowl and serve it at once, or
store it in the refrigerator. Bring the pesto back to room
temperature before serving. Makes 2 cups.

 &HT;    Buying Champagne for the millennium
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ They are the bubbles that stir men's souls
(women's, too). So let's spend some time bathing in their
effervescence.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we're talking Champagne, that great disappearing beverage
of the 1900s. By now, you've heard of the Great Millennium
Champagne Shortage, a story that television and print media find
utterly irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   It might be myth, it might be urban legend, or it might be a
marketing ploy to get folks to rush out and buy sparkling wine (No!
You don't suppose . . .?) But it's not true.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, if you have your heart set on one particular luxury brand
of Champagne to sip with your loved ones at the Y2K witching hour,
it might behoove you to buy that bottle now and keep it in a cool
place until New Year's Eve. Some regions of the country are
reporting shortages of luxury cuvees, those $100-and-up bottlings
of fine Champagne with the tiniest bubbles and the fanciest labels.
</P>
<P>
   But if you have no particular brand loyalty and are simply
looking for something delicious to pop the cork on at midnight,
you'll have no problem finding sparkling wines in any price range.
</P>
<P>
   Some Ohio wine retailers have searched off the beaten path and
found some real bargains, both in ``true'' Champagne from the
region in France of the same name (the French will tell you _ in no
uncertain terms _ that those are the only wines that should be
called Champagne) and in sparkling wines from elsewhere. Their
detective work will help ensure that the Great Shortage will not
leave too many revelers thirsting.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Reports magazine weighs in with its own sparkling-wine
recommendations in its November edition. The magazine bestowed its
``best-buy'' status to Domaine Carneros Brut 1993 ($22.99), a
California-grown sparkler made by the French Champagne firm
Taittinger, which the magazine said ``held its own against the
pricier French imports'' (the magazine said the 1994 and '95
vintages were comparable in quality). Two lesser-priced
Champagne-style wines that scored well included Freixenet Cordon
Negro Brut (Spain, $11) and Andre Brut (California, $4.50).
</P>
<P>
   One terminology tip: with sparkling wines, ``Brut'' refers to
the driest wines, and ``Extra Dry,'' strangely, are somewhat less
dry than ``Brut.'' Anything labeled ``Spumante'' is on the sweeter
side.
</P>
<P>
   My pick for non luxury sparklers: Domaine Ste. Michelle from
Washington makes a line of sparkling wines from Brut to Extra Dry
that all cost $12-$13 and are excellent values. The redesigned
bottles are pretty cool-looking, too.
</P>
<P>
   There should be plenty to go around.
</P>

   YOURE-FIRED _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Let's talk about job
security. What makes you so sure you have any? True, the economy's
booming, so it's not like there's a crowd panting over that cubicle
of yours. And yes, the company does have a good deal invested in
hiring, training and nurturing you _ not to mention what it laid
out to undeviate your septum. Besides, with all the
employment-protection laws and court cases, a boss can't just toss
people out the door the way a boss could toss before. You have the
right to a warning, a notice, a hearing, an appeal. Don't you?
You'd better click your way out of that online casino game and read
on. You are right about this much: It's hard to get fired these
days. Maybe harder than ever. But fear not _ we have five quick and
easy ways to get fired in this PC day and age. (Kalajian, Palm

   FAT-SURGERY _ ROYAL PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Ron Bovino once couldn't
stop eating. Four Big Macs. A large pizza. A plate of
bologna-cheese sandwiches. Yet he never felt full. Now people make
fun of him for ordering from the children's menu. The 38-year-old
Royal Palm Beach man is 260 pounds lighter because he had his
stomach stapled three years ago and has since worked religiously to
shed the fat. But his labors have left him with 30 pounds of skin
hanging around his waist like a ballerina's tutu _ an unseemly
sight he hides under his pants. Wednesday, surgeons will remove
Bovino's excess skin at JFK Medical Center in Atlantis. Bovino went
public with his story to give credit to his doctors and the
hospital, who have agreed not to bill him for the operation.

   FOOD-ANCIENT _ At the Sterling Museum at Yale U. are three
cuneiform tablets from ancient Mesopotamia that date to 1850 BC,
among the oldest recorded documents of humankind. When linguists
first tried to translate them, they figured they were from an
apothecary since they contained lists of ingredients followed by
instructions for combination. But a noted French assyriologist (a
linguist who studies Sumerian and Akkadian) and gourmet named Jean
Bottero discovered they were culinary texts. They are in fact the
world's first cookbooks and recipes sound surprisingly
contemporary. Quail braised with leeks, cumin and ginger.
Flatbread. Lamb stew. Barley ale. There's even a chicken pot pie.
I'll interview Bottero and the Yale curator, Ulla Kasten, to
elucidate the texts and the cookery lore and recipes from the
Fertile Crescent. I'll also reprint recipes developed by
assyriologists and updated for modern palates. No coagulated blood
dumplings or fermented ewe's milk, thank you very much. Sidebars

history, the world's best sellling cookbook as we turn the numbers

Great Millennium Champagne Shortage, a story that television and

dance was held last month, the semi-annual, 10-day gathering of the
Society of Shaggers _ called simply SOS _ in North Myrtle, S.C. The
event attracted thousands of dancers despite Hurricane Floyd's
recent visit.
</P>
<P>
   Shaggers, even those with just a few lessons, seem to whirl
easily through the dance. Tom and Sheila Dreps came to Rocky Mount
from Zebulon for a pre-Floyd shag class taught by Mike Boykin at
Club Image. Sheila, 51, knows how to two-step to country and to
line dance. Tom, 57, took shag classes several years ago, but said
he quit when he found the instructor's directions too confusing.
The couple decided to take this class because beach music and
shagging are part of many social engagements they attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got tired of sitting on the sidelines,'' Sheila said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, they went to Fat Harold's, a well-known shag
club in Myrtle Beach, S.C. ``That's when I decided to learn,'' said
Tom.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Kenly, N.C., Sheila heard shag music often,
including songs by The Tams and The Band of Oz. Tom heard some of
it, during his Marine stint at Camp Lejeune in the '60s, but it
didn't appeal to him then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never liked beach music until I took shagging lessons,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The shag moves on a fairly simple, eight-step routine, combined
with a number of turns and twirls and a touch of fancy footwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shagging isn't like anything else,'' Tom said, followed by
Sheila, who added, ``It has its own flow.''
</P>
<P>
   The basic movement has a man and woman facing each other, his
left hand holding her right, explained Rick Bennett, a member of
the Rocky Mount shag club and teacher of an informal shag class
held in a city apartment complex.
</P>
<P>
   A rug is rolled back and some furniture is shifted in the
complex's clubhouse to provide a dance space.
</P>
<P>
   Three couples practiced turns along one wall, while a fourth
couple worked on the basic movement.
</P>
<P>
   On the beat ``one and two,'' they both shuffle toward each
other, a man stepping forward on his left foot, then on his right
and again on his left.
</P>
<P>
   On the beat ``three and four,'' they shuffle back, the man
moving first on the right, then left, then right foot. The beats
``seven, eight'' have the man leaning back on his right foot on
``seven,'' then coming forward slightly on his left on ``eight.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether face to face on beats ``one and two'' or at arm's length
on ``seven and eight,'' the partners continue to hold hands. A
woman's steps mirror the man's.
</P>
<P>
   The novice shaggers in Bennett's class work easily into the
dance, while the more experienced dancers spin easily through the
steps.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett circulates among the pairs, coaching men and women as he
goes. All of them dance as songs such as ``Be Young, Be Foolish, Be
Happy,'' ``Weekend Lover'' and ``Miss Grace'' play quietly on a
portable stereo.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Brenna Mottershead, who started shagging in March, helps
lead a novice female shagger through the basic shag movements. With
the novice standing behind her and watching her feet, Mottershead
went through the step counting, ``one and two, three and four,
five, six'' time and again.
</P>
<P>
   It all clicked when Bennett took the rookie's hand. From a few
repetitions of the basic movement, the pair quickly and easily
worked their way through a series of spins and turns as if they
were regular partners on a seaside dance floor. When they stopped,
Mottershead applauded enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   Part of shagging's appeal is that it isn't limited to the young.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great things about shagging is you can go to SOS or
those things, and you can see people in their 70s having fun,''
Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaggers trace their roots back about 50 years, with beach music
coming first, said Steve Hardy, a long-time beach music radio
announcer.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the roots of beach music come out of black music, rhythm
and blues,'' he explained. ``A lot of people think the original
beach music song was `Drinking Wine, Spoody Ody''' by Sticks McKee.
</P>
<P>
   The music category has moved back and forth between what some
consider pop and to what others label beach music. Early groups and
hits included The Dominos, with ``60-Minute Man;'' The Catalinas,
``Summertime's Calling Me;'' Maurice Williams and The Zodiacs,
``Stay;'' and Wilson, N.C.'s own The Kays, who had a national hit
with ``I'm a Girl Watcher.''
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of places to shag, some along the coast and
others inland, said Hardy, who is host of the weekly show ``Steve
Hardy's Original Beach Party'' on WNCT-FM in Greenville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Along the coast was the Atlantic Beach Pavilion, which was
famous for its large wooden dance floor. ``All the national bands
would come through,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Early beach music fans danced the bop, the Lindy or the
jitterbug _ all dances that survived from years earlier _ to their
favorite group's hits.
</P>
<P>
   Beach music was in its teen-age years before its accompanying
dance developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shag, the word shag, probably didn't come about until the
mid-'60s,'' Hardy said.
</P>

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ You can always count on someone
_ some adult, that is _ trying to spoil the fun of Halloween, to
find evil in the inventive, menace in the magical. So I suppose it
was only a matter of time before someone tried to ruin Harry Potter
for us. Parents in Columbia, S.C., have persuaded the state's Board
of Education to review whether the runaway bestsellers should be
allowed in the classroom. Now, the Cincinnati-based Family Friendly
Libraries (www.fflibraries.org) has jumped on the bandwagon,
attacking the books about the young magician for their supposed
occult themes, violent content and anti-family bias. (McCarty,

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ DENVER _ My heart sank when I spotted the fat,
oversized envelope from my mother's health maintenance organization
among the other items in her ``To Read'' box. I knew that a
correspondence course in nuclear physics would be easier to

fixed incomes who need the health care but cannot afford the price
hikes are really hurt since many doctors refuse to see Medicare
patients unless they are members of managed-care organizations.

   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Coke is working on a machine that
will charge you more for a soda pop in hot weather. In summer, when
you are thirstier, the price of a Coke would rise automatically
with the thermometer. According to The New York Times, the
technology to pull off this holdup appears to be available thanks
to a computer chip and a temperature sensor. So I guess if a guy
had just crawled across the Mojave Desert up to a Coke machine, the
price of a soda could conceivably rise to several thousand dollars.
What's next? An ATM machine that has a double or nothing button on
it? (Kelso, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

   YOURE-FIRED _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Let's talk about job
security. What makes you so sure you have any? True, the economy's
booming, so it's not like there's a crowd panting over that cubicle
of yours. And yes, the company does have a good deal invested in
hiring, training and nurturing you _ not to mention what it laid
out to undeviate your septum. Besides, with all the
employment-protection laws and court cases, a boss can't just toss
people out the door the way a boss could toss before. You have the
right to a warning, a notice, a hearing, an appeal. Don't you?
You'd better click your way out of that online casino game and read
on. You are right about this much: It's hard to get fired these
days. Maybe harder than ever. But fear not _ we have five quick and
easy ways to get fired in this PC day and age. (Kalajian, Palm

   FAT-SURGERY _ ROYAL PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Ron Bovino once couldn't
stop eating. Four Big Macs. A large pizza. A plate of
bologna-cheese sandwiches. Yet he never felt full. Now people make
fun of him for ordering from the children's menu. The 38-year-old
Royal Palm Beach man is 260 pounds lighter because he had his
stomach stapled three years ago and has since worked religiously to
shed the fat. But his labors have left him with 30 pounds of skin
hanging around his waist like a ballerina's tutu _ an unseemly
sight he hides under his pants. Wednesday, surgeons will remove
Bovino's excess skin at JFK Medical Center in Atlantis. Bovino went
public with his story to give credit to his doctors and the
hospital, who have agreed not to bill him for the operation.

   FOOD-ANCIENT _ At the Sterling Museum at Yale U. are three
cuneiform tablets from ancient Mesopotamia that date to 1850 BC,
among the oldest recorded documents of humankind. When linguists
first tried to translate them, they figured they were from an
apothecary since they contained lists of ingredients followed by
instructions for combination. But a noted French assyriologist (a
linguist who studies Sumerian and Akkadian) and gourmet named Jean
Bottero discovered they were culinary texts. They are in fact the
world's first cookbooks and recipes sound surprisingly
contemporary. Quail braised with leeks, cumin and ginger.
Flatbread. Lamb stew. Barley ale. There's even a chicken pot pie.
I'll interview Bottero and the Yale curator, Ulla Kasten, to
elucidate the texts and the cookery lore and recipes from the
Fertile Crescent. I'll also reprint recipes developed by
assyriologists and updated for modern palates. No coagulated blood
dumplings or fermented ewe's milk, thank you very much. Sidebars
will look at a timeline of the important culinary texts of recorded
history, the world's best sellling cookbook as we turn the numbers

   WRESTLING-MUSIC _ Before you even play the first cut, there are
several clues that ``Blassie: King of Men'' is no typical record.
The first would be the front cover, where the ``recording artist''
holds a guitar while attempting to take a bite out of it. And on
the bottom is this disclaimer: ``Warning: The Geek General has
determined that listening to this record may be hazardous to your
health.'' Those who dare go further discover another clue: The
four-song EP is cut in blood-red vinyl, a nod to wrestler/manager
Fred Blassie's tendency to make his mat opponents bleed. (Braun,

ELECTRIC CHAIR TOO BARBARIC FOR OUR STANDARDS OF DECENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the 
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.) 
(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   c. 1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   In a
surprise move last week, the U.S. Supreme Court decided to review a
Florida death penalty case (Bryan vs. Moore) to determine whether
that state's use of the electric chair constitutes cruel and
unusual punishment. The late U.S. Supreme Court Justice William
Brennan suggested that electrocution was ``nothing less than the
contemporary technological equivalent of burning people at the
stake.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although there is hope that the high court will end the use of
the electric chair as barbaric and a violation of the Eighth
Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment, this court
has been deaf to the idea of ``volving standards of decency that
mark the progress of a maturing society.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, we do not boil the condemned in oil or water, nor
burn people at the stake, nor behead them on a block or at a
guillotine. Fortunately, these former methods of execution are now
considered brutal and barbaric by our modern standards of human
dignity and decency.
</P>
<P>
   There have been three botched executions in Florida since 1990
using the electric chair _ long bolts of flame have been recorded
shooting out of the headpieces and the masks covering the faces of
the inmates. In the execution that took place on July 8 using
Florida's new electric chair, blood poured out of the inmate's
mouth and nose and covered his chest before he died.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the high court rules that electrocution can no longer be
used as a means of execution, Anthony Bryan will still face the
death penalty for shooting his victim in the face with a shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   Only four states authorize the use of the electric chair as the
sole means of execution: Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Nebraska.
The other six states that still use the electric chair _ Arkansas,
Kentucky, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia _ also
authorize another method of execution, usually lethal injection.
The high court's ruling will undoubtedly affect all these states in
some fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court first reviewed the constitutionality of
electrocution in the Kimmler case in 1890. William Kimmler was to
be the first person to be executed in New York's electric chair. He
appealed to the Supreme Court that this sentence constituted cruel
and unusual punishment. New York had previously used hanging as its
method of execution but had found that electrocution would be ``a
less barbarous manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The high court wrote: ``The legislature accordingly appointed a
commission to investigate and report `the most humane and practical
method known to modern science of carrying into effect the sentence
of death in capital cases.' This commission reported in favor of
execution by electricity.''
</P>
<P>
   At the conclusion of its decision, the high court noted about
electrocution: ``the legislature of the state of New York
determined that it did not inflict cruel and unusual punishment,
and its courts have sustained that determination. We cannot
perceive that the state has thereby abridged the privileges or
immunities of the petitioner, or deprived him of due process of
law.'' Kimmler was electrocuted, but the execution was botched and
the executioner had to throw the switch on Kimmler several times
before he died.
</P>
<P>
   The Eighth Amendment states: ``Excessive bail shall not be
required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual
punishment inflicted.'' The prohibition against cruel and unusual
punishment must mean, at least, that the infliction of unnecessary
pain or torture is forbidden by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In the context of the death penalty, that prohibition must mean,
at least, that the condemned must not suffer a lingering, painful
death.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the electric chair, too often death is not
instantaneous but lingering and painful.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal in Glass vs.
Louisiana (1985) wherein Jimmy Glass contended that ``electrocution
causes the gratuitous infliction of unnecessary pain and
suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the high court's denial of appeal, Justice
Brennan wrote a dissent which quotes those who have witnessed
electrocutions: ``when the switch is thrown, the condemned prisoner
`cringes,' `leaps,' and `fights the straps with amazing strength.'
The hands turn red, then white, and the cords of the neck stand out
like steel bands. The prisoner's limbs, fingers, toes, and face are
severely contorted. The force of the electrical current is so
powerful that the prisoner's eyeballs sometimes pop out and `rest
on his cheeks.' The prisoner often defecates, urinates, and vomits
blood and drool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the prisoner catches on fire, particularly if he
perspires excessively. Witnesses hear a loud and sustained sound
`like bacon frying' and `the sickly sweet smell of burning flesh'
permeates the chamber. This `smell of frying human flesh in the
immediate neighborhood of the chair is sometimes bad enough to
nauseate even the Press representatives who are present.' In the
meantime, the prisoner almost literally boils. ... The body
frequently is badly burned and disfigured.''
</P>
<P>
   Brennan quotes renowned French electrical scientist L.G.V. Rota,
who concluded after researching the issue: ``in every case of
electrocution ... death inevitably supervenes but it may be very
long, and above all, excruciatingly painful. ... in particular
cases, the condemned person may be alive and even conscious for
several minutes without it being possible for a doctor to say
whether the victim is dead or not. This method of execution is a
form of torture.''
</P>
<P>
   Brennan calls electrocution ``death by installments'' and
illustrates his point by examples when condemned prisoners had to
be given numerous charges of electricity in order to kill them. The
execution of John Louis Evans took 14 minutes and three separate
charges of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Alpha Otis Stephens took more than eight minutes to die. The
doctors had to wait six minutes for the body to cool to determine
that he was still alive. A second two-minute charge of electricity
was then sent through his body.
</P>
<P>
   Whether one supports capital punishment or not, the electric
chair must be seen as a morally cruel device. Certainly, our sense
of human dignity and decency demands that this mode of execution be
abandoned to the past. Let it takes its place next to the
guillotine _ in the trash heap of the Dark Ages.

DOES THE BIBLE TEACH MEAT-EATING?

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    My 2-year-old daughter is a vegetarian. Except for the rare
Chicken McNugget, she responds to meat saying, ``No, mommy. No
meat.''
 &HT;    I admire her determination. For years, I've been a wannabe
vegetarian. At times the thought of eating a murdered animal makes
me ill. Lacking discipline, however, I have never been able to
sustain vegetarianism.
 &HT;    Instead, I have opted to buy humanely farmed animal products
whenever possible. At the very least, animals should be happy
before they die.
 &HT;    Over the last decade, many of my friends have become
vegetarians. Their choice reflects ethical or religious
commitments.
 &HT;    The ethical rationales for vegetarianism fall into two
categories:
 &HT;    --moral opposition to killing
 &HT;    --a concern for environmental issues.
 &HT;    Often, moral vegetarians also oppose war and the death penalty
as part of a holistic life ethic. Environmental vegetarians argue
that intensive farming methods -- including the use of pesticides
and antibiotics -- ruin the planet.
 &HT;    The religious dimensions of vegetarianism are not quite as
obvious. Although some eastern religions prescribe vegetarianism,
the western religious traditions (Christianity, Judaism and Islam)
of most Americans do not.
 &HT;    Indeed, raise the question of vegetarianism with a Baptist
neighbor and he will probably quote Genesis in response: ``And God
said, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it;
and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of
the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.''
 &HT;    The Bible, it appears, teaches meat-eating. Vegetarianism seems
oddly sacrilegious.
 &HT;    Bible readers -- particularly Christians -- often use the
Genesis ``dominion'' passage to justify human abuse of the earth.
In 1967, ULCA history professor Lynn White charged in a widely
influential article that ``Christianity made it possible to exploit
nature in a mood of indifference to the feelings of natural
objects.'' Christian concern for animals? Biblical concern for
animals? Impossible.
 &HT;    Last month, PBS aired ``Reason for Hope,'' the spiritual
autobiography of naturalist Jane Goodall (based on her recent book
of the same name). Perhaps the most extraordinary thing about
Goodall's life story is how her Christianity led her to have
compassion for nonhuman animals.
 &HT;    The minister of Goodall's childhood Congregational church played
a major role in her life. ``The Christian religion came alive as I
listened to his sermons -- I felt very close to Jesus, and I prayed
to Him a good deal.'' She read and memorized the Bible. Even after
exploring other religions she insists, ``My deep love of Jesus
remained -- I felt that I had a personal relationship with Jesus.''
 &HT;    Goodall's ``personal relationship'' did not make her into a
biblical fundamentalist. Instead, it filled her with wonder about
creation and fuelled her interest in science -- especially
evolution and the relationship between humans and chimpanzees.
 &HT;    Science enhanced her religious experience. She articulates an
``animal rights'' position -- including being a vegetarian --
consonant with Christian theology. ``Reason for Hope'' presents the
astonishing sweep of her spirituality -- biblically informed,
inclusive Christianity based on love for all living things.
 &HT;    Goodall is neither the first or only Christian to conclude that
a faithful reading of the Bible leads to compassion for nonhuman
animals. In 1923, the German theologian and medical doctor, Albert
Schweitzer, argued for a similar ethic of ``reverence for life.''
He proposed that ``It is good to maintain and cherish life; it is
evil to destroy and to check life.''
 &HT;    This ethic came from two sources: Schweitzer's own Christian
faith and his commitment to science, especially evolutionary
theory. Both faith and science taught the fundamental unity of
creation. To destroy any life was to undermine the eternal -- and
ongoing -- work of God.
 &HT;    Schweitzer believed that animals suffer. Although he thought it
necessary (as does Goodall) to do limited animal research for
medical purposes, he chastised callous medical researchers: ``Those
who test operations or drugs on animal -- sought never to rest
satisfied with the general idea that their dreadful doings are
performed in the pursuit of a worthy aim.'' Instead, he called on
researchers to be compassionate: ``No one ought to permit, in so
far as he can prevent it, pain or suffering for which he will not
take responsibility.''
 &HT;    Compassionate toward nonhuman animals is part of a biblical
worldview. As the author of Proverbs wrote, ``A righteous man
regardeth the life of his beast.'' And as Jesus stated, ``Blessed
are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.''
 &HT;    For far too long the biblical call to ``reverence for life'' has
been obscured by a literalistic, unscientific fundamentalism. It is
time for people of biblical faiths to pay attention to their Gods
call to love all of creation.

<P>
   In the world of music videos, stylists used to be anonymous
entities _ when they existed at all. As music videos become an
integral part of an artist's marketing message, the music-video
stylist has assumed an ascendant position, helping to craft the
public image that will sell those records and inspire fans all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might see a fashion look from the video shoot incorporated
for the CD,'' says Mike Fish, fashion marketing director of Spin
magazine. He points to the white fashion theme in the Backstreet
Boys video ``I Want It That Way'' that was then carried over into
the ``Millennium'' record.
</P>
<P>
   Music videos are ``an artistic marketing endeavor,'' Fish says.
So much so, he adds, that ``you will hear a denim company say that
an artist is helping sell a particular pair of overalls'' when it's
seen by fans in the artist's video.
</P>
<P>
   Emil Wilbekin, editor of Vibe magazine, says stylists ``know
what's hot on the street and what's hot in Paris and Milan, and
they're able to translate the images for the artists _ whether it's
sexy or fun or thuggish.''
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop is a primary forum for the work of stylists. Wilbekin
says that ``esthetics are so important to hip-hop that artists have
put a lot of money into marketing their image. It's a cultural
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Blevins, fashion editor of Rolling Stone, concurs. ``Music
artists have realized that they have to look so good in these music
videos, and they've got to wear the latest Dolce &AMP; Gabbana. The
audience is looking up to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fish points to Gavin Rossdale of Bush and his penchant for
wearing contemporary designers like Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young men would look to him for style direction,'' he says.
And pop sensation Ricky Martin has become ``the poster child for
Giorgio Armani. He makes the clothes come alive,'' Fish adds.
</P>
<P>
   The current interest in music videos is such that MTV actually
has a behind-the-scenes show called ``Making the Video,'' which has
featured Jennifer Lopez, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Puff Daddy, with
future shows scheduled on Sugar Ray, Garbage and Whitney Houston.
</P>
<P>
   In the video-styling realm, street fashion coexists with
designer couture and custom designs. Vintage pieces are the icing
on the cake.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Lieberman, 31, who has worked in videos for
singer/actress Jennifer Lopez, Mary J. Blige, Everlast, Wyclef Jean
and Pras, says the starting point for any video stylist is the
director's treatment. But that only goes so far, adds Lieberman:
``The bigger the artist, the less the director can say about their
image. Jennifer (Lopez) has a clear idea of what her image is, but
by the same token they (artists) would never be able to do it
without us. A stylist acts as the artist's eyes and ears and
differentiates what Jennifer's going to wear from what Foxy Brown
would wear.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman describes Lopez's look as ``high-fashion, sexy couture
infused with a little bit of street.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Lopez favors such sexy, top-drawer designers as Versace,
Gucci and Dolce &AMP; Gabbana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work very closely with Donatella. We also work with Prada.
Everybody wants to dress her,'' Lieberman adds.
</P>
<P>
   While Lieberman shops designer lines for clothes, she also works
on custom looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work a lot with Puffy and the majority of his stuff is
custom,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend these days is adaptability,'' says Lieberman, using
Everlast as an example. Musically, she says, ``he's hip-hop, he's
funk, he's blues, he's rock, so we'll take the fly Gucci leather
jacket with some Enyce or Polo black jeans.''
</P>
<P>
   Style-wise Everlast ``is pretty much straight-up street _ a
little bit of white trash and a little bit of hip-hop. We used a
lot of Triple Five Soul, Ecko Unlimited, Structure. It's raw, it's
spiritual, it's deep and it's street,'' Lieberman says.
</P>
<P>
   She emphasizes that ``the most important thing with my artists
is we don't like to look like we're trying too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The average budget on Lieberman's jobs has been between $10,000
and $20,000 but have been as high as $35,000 to $40,000 for the
``Puffy level.''
</P>
<P>
   Budgets have risen, she says, because ``everybody in R&AMP;B wants
to be in fur and leather and jewels, and that costs money.''
</P>
<P>
   June Ambrose, 28, is another top stylist in the music video
field who works with Puff Daddy. She's also part of the triumvirate
known as the Mode Squad (pronounced like the old TV series) that
includes Roger McKenzie, 29, and Andrew Caesar, 27. Their resume of
music videos reads like a roster of the top hip-hop and R&AMP;B acts:
R. Kelly, Missy Elliot, Mariah Carey, Will Smith, Busta Rhymes and
Janet Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting for an interview, Ambrose is the picture of high-fashion
chic. She wears a Gucci jeans-jacket and boots with her skirt and
finishes off her look with a pink pashmina scarf and Fendi baguette
bag. She started styling about nine years ago, ``when artists only
wanted to wear black, brown and gray,'' she says. ``I put Jay-Z
into his first Armani suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Flash-forward to 1999 for the Hype Williams-directed video
``Something Wet'' with Busta Rhymes and Janet Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The object was for Busta to look like a terminator,'' Ambrose
says. ``We used silver mylar that looks like chrome. I was inspired
by Thierry Mugler and science-fiction magazines. The dancers were
supposed to look like raindrops or amoebas.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose says that ``because we spend so much money on it, the
music video has incorporated many film elements.'' She cited
Japanese animation as an important influence. ``Music videos should
take you out of reality,'' she maintains. ``I always tell my
clients, `It's not about you; you're playing a part. When you go
home you can be yourself.'''
</P>
<P>
   While the Mode Squad often uses designs from Ralph Lauren,
Prada, Versace, Armani, Gucci and Gaultier, it is increasingly
doing more custom looks for its clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to deliver something to my clients that's not been seen
before _ we're sketching and creating it from the core. We can
easily pull Versace and Gucci, but just being a high-fashion
stylist is boring. With Hype Williams, we work on the evolution of
hip-hop fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose and the Mode Squad, because of their high-profile work
and success rate, have been instrumental in turning stying into a
real profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with music videos that have an $80,000 clothing
budget. It's a lot of pressure for the stylist because you
basically have to deliver a marketing tool to the record company,''
Ambrose says. ``Styling has become a newfound phenomenon. We're not
just personal shoppers; it's artist development.''

   Stylist John Baptiste, 28, is the fashion editor for XXL
magazine and has his own company called Baptised Inc. He used to
work for record labels Sony, Motown and RCA doing radio promotion,
and has styled videos for Wu-Tang Clan and SWV.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a black Sean John jeans-jacket, denim RLX snowboarding
pants and an Avirex watch, he radiates a street vibe _ which
translates into his styling choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I use clothing, I avoid the big labels,'' he says,
because, ultimately, he's more concerned with communicating the
concept of the video. His budgets have ranged from $400 to $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   For the Wu-Tang video, the look was inspired by the film ``The
Matrix,'' which Baptiste saw four times. He had just four days to
create the padded leather costumes with set-in muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan native Wendy Schecter, 35, has been a stylist for 15
years. ``I had been picking out people's clothes since I was 8 and
I found out at 19 that I could get paid for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her first video was Debbie Gibson's ``Only in My Dreams,'' after
which she spent two years doing low-budget hip-hop videos. Her last
video was for Luscious Jackson, which was directed by filmmaker
Tamara Davis (``Gun Crazy''). She has also styled videos for Sting
and Santana and was responsible for Courtney Love's dramatic
high-fashion makeover when she showed up at the Academy Awards in a
white Versace gown.
</P>
<P>
   Schecter approaches each artist and each situation differently.
For Santana, Schecter says, ``Carlos had these beautiful jackets
from the '40s and we put together looks around them.
</P>
<P>
   She maintains that ``people that wind up becoming celebs _
there's something about them, there's a spark. I like to find that
spark and develop it into something magnificent and personal or the
thing they didn't know they wanted yet. It's me helping them flesh
out their fantasy; it's the objective eye helping them realize
their vision.''

<P>
   In the world of music videos, stylists used to be anonymous
entities _ when they existed at all. As music videos become an
integral part of an artist's marketing message, the music-video
stylist has assumed an ascendant position, helping to craft the
public image that will sell those records and inspire fans all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might see a fashion look from the video shoot incorporated
for the CD,'' says Mike Fish, fashion marketing director of Spin
magazine. He points to the white fashion theme in the Backstreet
Boys video ``I Want It That Way'' that was then carried over into
the ``Millennium'' record.
</P>
<P>
   Music videos are ``an artistic marketing endeavor,'' Fish says.
So much so, he adds, that ``you will hear a denim company say that
an artist is helping sell a particular pair of overalls'' when it's
seen by fans in the artist's video.
</P>
<P>
   Emil Wilbekin, editor of Vibe magazine, says stylists ``know
what's hot on the street and what's hot in Paris and Milan, and
they're able to translate the images for the artists _ whether it's
sexy or fun or thuggish.''
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop is a primary forum for the work of stylists. Wilbekin
says that ``esthetics are so important to hip-hop that artists have
put a lot of money into marketing their image. It's a cultural
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Blevins, fashion editor of Rolling Stone, concurs. ``Music
artists have realized that they have to look so good in these music
videos, and they've got to wear the latest Dolce &AMP; Gabbana. The
audience is looking up to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fish points to Gavin Rossdale of Bush and his penchant for
wearing contemporary designers like Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young men would look to him for style direction,'' he says.
And pop sensation Ricky Martin has become ``the poster child for
Giorgio Armani. He makes the clothes come alive,'' Fish adds.
</P>
<P>
   The current interest in music videos is such that MTV actually
has a behind-the-scenes show called ``Making the Video,'' which has
featured Jennifer Lopez, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Puff Daddy, with
future shows scheduled on Sugar Ray, Garbage and Whitney Houston.
</P>
<P>
   In the video-styling realm, street fashion coexists with
designer couture and custom designs. Vintage pieces are the icing
on the cake.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Lieberman, 31, who has worked in videos for
singer/actress Jennifer Lopez, Mary J. Blige, Everlast, Wyclef Jean
and Pras, says the starting point for any video stylist is the
director's treatment. But that only goes so far, adds Lieberman:
``The bigger the artist, the less the director can say about their
image. Jennifer (Lopez) has a clear idea of what her image is, but
by the same token they (artists) would never be able to do it
without us. A stylist acts as the artist's eyes and ears and
differentiates what Jennifer's going to wear from what Foxy Brown
would wear.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman describes Lopez's look as ``high-fashion, sexy couture
infused with a little bit of street.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Lopez favors such sexy, top-drawer designers as Versace,
Gucci and Dolce &AMP; Gabbana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work very closely with Donatella. We also work with Prada.
Everybody wants to dress her,'' Lieberman adds.
</P>
<P>
   While Lieberman shops designer lines for clothes, she also works
on custom looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work a lot with Puffy and the majority of his stuff is
custom,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend these days is adaptability,'' says Lieberman, using
Everlast as an example. Musically, she says, ``he's hip-hop, he's
funk, he's blues, he's rock, so we'll take the fly Gucci leather
jacket with some Enyce or Polo black jeans.''
</P>
<P>
   Style-wise Everlast ``is pretty much straight-up street _ a
little bit of white trash and a little bit of hip-hop. We used a
lot of Triple Five Soul, Ecko Unlimited, Structure. It's raw, it's
spiritual, it's deep and it's street,'' Lieberman says.
</P>
<P>
   She emphasizes that ``the most important thing with my artists
is we don't like to look like we're trying too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The average budget on Lieberman's jobs has been between $10,000
and $20,000 but have been as high as $35,000 to $40,000 for the
``Puffy level.''
</P>
<P>
   Budgets have risen, she says, because ``everybody in R&AMP;B wants
to be in fur and leather and jewels, and that costs money.''
</P>
<P>
   June Ambrose, 28, is another top stylist in the music video
field who works with Puff Daddy. She's also part of the triumvirate
known as the Mode Squad (pronounced like the old TV series) that
includes Roger McKenzie, 29, and Andrew Caesar, 27. Their resume of
music videos reads like a roster of the top hip-hop and R&AMP;B acts:
R. Kelly, Missy Elliot, Mariah Carey, Will Smith, Busta Rhymes and
Janet Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting for an interview, Ambrose is the picture of high-fashion
chic. She wears a Gucci jeans-jacket and boots with her skirt and
finishes off her look with a pink pashmina scarf and Fendi baguette
bag. She started styling about nine years ago, ``when artists only
wanted to wear black, brown and gray,'' she says. ``I put Jay-Z
into his first Armani suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Flash-forward to 1999 for the Hype Williams-directed video
``Something Wet'' with Busta Rhymes and Janet Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The object was for Busta to look like a terminator,'' Ambrose
says. ``We used silver mylar that looks like chrome. I was inspired
by Thierry Mugler and science-fiction magazines. The dancers were
supposed to look like raindrops or amoebas.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose says that ``because we spend so much money on it, the
music video has incorporated many film elements.'' She cited
Japanese animation as an important influence. ``Music videos should
take you out of reality,'' she maintains. ``I always tell my
clients, `It's not about you; you're playing a part. When you go
home you can be yourself.'''
</P>
<P>
   While the Mode Squad often uses designs from Ralph Lauren,
Prada, Versace, Armani, Gucci and Gaultier, it is increasingly
doing more custom looks for its clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to deliver something to my clients that's not been seen
before _ we're sketching and creating it from the core. We can
easily pull Versace and Gucci, but just being a high-fashion
stylist is boring. With Hype Williams, we work on the evolution of
hip-hop fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose and the Mode Squad, because of their high-profile work
and success rate, have been instrumental in turning stying into a
real profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with music videos that have an $80,000 clothing
budget. It's a lot of pressure for the stylist because you
basically have to deliver a marketing tool to the record company,''
Ambrose says. ``Styling has become a newfound phenomenon. We're not
just personal shoppers; it's artist development.''
</P>
<P>
   Stylist John Baptiste, 28, is the fashion editor for XXL
magazine and has his own company called Baptised Inc. He used to
work for record labels Sony, Motown and RCA doing radio promotion,
and has styled videos for Wu-Tang Clan and SWV.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a black Sean John jeans-jacket, denim RLX snowboarding
pants and an Avirex watch, he radiates a street vibe _ which
translates into his styling choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I use clothing, I avoid the big labels,'' he says,
because, ultimately, he's more concerned with communicating the

</P>
<P>
   For the Wu-Tang video, the look was inspired by the film ``The

create the padded leather costumes with set-in muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan native Wendy Schecter, 35, has been a stylist for 15
years. ``I had been picking out people's clothes since I was 8 and
I found out at 19 that I could get paid for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her first video was Debbie Gibson's ``Only in My Dreams,'' after
which she spent two years doing low-budget hip-hop videos. Her last

   Ali MacGraw is stepping into a new role: accessories designer.
And while that may seem like a stretch for someone who achieved
movie-star status for roles in such classic films as ``Love Story''
and ``Goodbye Columbus,'' the actress actually spent the first six
years after college working in the fashion industry _ first, as
Diana Vreeland's assistant at Harper's Bazaar, and later as a
stylist to the fashion photographer Melvin Sokolsky.
</P>
<P>
   Her collection of luxurious handbags and pashmina shawls shows
that she hasn't forgotten what she learned then. The pieces feature
traditional Indian designs in strong colors, from rich fuchsias and
bonfire reds to vibrant aquas and warm greens, and many of the
looks are inspired by her passion for exotic travel.
</P>
<P>
   MacGraw got involved in this venture in much the same way she
got her start in acting--by chance. Back in the '60s, an agent
spotted her photo in a Chanel bath oil advertisement and urged her
to test for film parts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, she landed the starmaking role in the film ``Goodbye
Columbus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I became an overnight success. It was thrilling, yet
terrifying at the same time. I come from a very practical
background, and the glamour that success brought was unfamiliar to
me,'' she says. But she was a quick study, and swiftly became
Hollywood's girl-of-the-moment, marrying Robert Evans, head of
production at Paramount, and later, Steve McQueen.
</P>
<P>
   MacGraw, who's now living in Santa Fe, New Mexico, decided to
start her business after a conversation with Veena Advani, a master
embroiderer who has worked for such designers as Isaac Mizrahi and
Oscar de la Renta.
</P>
<P>
   The two became business partners, and named the company Ali
MacGraw Milagro _ milagro means miracle in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   MacGraw is quick to point out that her collection isn't intended
to be trendy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a slave to fashion,'' she says. ``I'm just doing what
I love. Indian textiles and designs are very hot right now, but I
will continue doing them even when the fashion world has moved to
another area of the world. I'm fascinated with the culture of India
and its sensibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The handbags vary in shape from soft silk shoulder-strap pouches
with tassel accents to more structured, sophisticated clutches.
</P>
<P>
   The collection is available at Jeffrey, New York; Neiman Marcus;
Browns in London, and Savannah, Santa Monica. Prices range from
$350 to $1,100 for the beaded bags and $600 to $1,200 for the
pashminas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an adventure for me,'' MacGraw says. ``And the most
important part is to enjoy the whole process of it, not just the
outcome. Even if this collection isn't a success, I know 21
girlfriends will have the best presents.''

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   ``En charge!''
</P>
<P>
   With his rallying cry, technician Bruno Duguay throws a switch
to power up a 50-foot generator on the laboratory floor. A display
on the instrument panel ticks off the mounting charge one kilovolt
at a time.
</P>
<P>
   It will take three or four minutes before the generator's
voltage climbs high enough to transfer to the electrodes. In the
glass-walled control room, Duguay and half a dozen colleagues are
supercharged with anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   It's said that lightning never strikes the same place twice. But
the folks here can make it strike the same place 100 times a day.
That place is the high-voltage laboratory run by Canadian power
giant Hydro-Quebec, one of the world's premier facilities for
studying the most shocking electrical phenomena.
</P>
<P>
   The short, straight lightning bolts that dart between the lab's
electrodes are a highly domesticated version of the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Duguay reaches across the instrument panel to sound a warning
blast out on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attention! Ca va claquer!'' (``Look out! It's going to
spark!'')
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, when he pushes a black button on a gray box, the
crack of an arc lights the lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real sound-and-light show,'' says Bruno LaFontaine,
lead scientist on the project.
</P>
<P>
   La Fontaine's group is in the vanguard of international efforts
to tame lightning _ to trigger the strikes and guide them away from
power lines and installations, thus saving electric utilities
millions of dollars a year in outages and damaged equipment.
</P>
<P>
   By shooting laser beams at thunderclouds, the lightning tamers
hope to channel a discharge toward a relatively safe location
before Mother Nature does worse. It's one of those really cool
ideas that seems better suited to science fiction than science.
</P>
<P>
   The setting for La Fontaine's work does nothing to dispel that
impression. Located in the Montreal suburb of Varennes, the
windowless high-voltage lab resembles an alien monolith from
``2001: A Space Odyssey.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the decor is more ``Lost in Space'': pale-blue 150-foot
walls bathed in stark gray light, ceramic towers girded by thick
silver rings, silver domes made up of small round plates like the
compound eyes of an insect.
</P>
<P>
   The electrodes used in the lightning experiments complete the
sci-fi effect. Instead of slender rods, there are two circles of
loose wire mesh suspended from the ceiling like huge trampolines,
one hanging about 20 feet above the other. When sufficient charge
flows to a rod descending from the upper electrode, an arc of
current jumps between their centers.
</P>
<P>
   La Fontaine is demonstrating his latest findings to French
collaborator Anne Bondiou-Clergerie of the Office National d'Etudes
et de Recherches Aerospatiales in Chatillon
</P>
<P>
   Bondiou is an expert on the physics of lightning formation,
which is still poorly understood, she says, even two centuries
after Ben Franklin flew a kite in the rain.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning strikes start in thunderheads when the strong thermal
updrafts that build the towering clouds cause water droplets and
ice crystals to collide, creating positively and negatively charged
particles.
</P>
<P>
   These particles separate by weight and form electric fields
within the cloud as well as between the cloud and the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The fields get amplified around water droplets, creating
electric currents called streamers that coalesce like the
tributaries of a river, forming even more strongly ionized
channels.
</P>
<P>
   These conductive channels propagate downward until a discharge
jumps the gap between the channel and the ground. Then a wave of
current surges upward through the small channel. Bondiou and other
experts call this final, visible stage the ``return stroke.'' The
rest of us call it lightning, and it can carry current of up to
300,000 amperes (household current rarely exceeds 50 amperes).
</P>
<P>
   Lightning rods ground strikes because their pointy edges produce
amplified electric fields that can induce an arc before the
electric field in the cloud grows strong enough to break down
spontaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, electrical energy doesn't discriminate between
inexpensive metal rods and tall, sharp points on valuable
voltage-sensitive equipment. That's why nearly every structure in
the high-voltage lab is protected by rounded surfaces: These
Jetson-esque rings and domes prevent the generation of unintended
local discharges.
</P>
<P>
   LaFontaine's goal is to provoke controlled discharges. His
simulations re-create the charged field of a thundercloud: The rod
represents the ionized channels that descend from a cloud, and the
lower electrode represents the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But the lab experiments include another element definitely not
found in nature: a state-of-the-art titanium-sapphire laser whose
light is beamed up from the floor and through a hole in the center
of the lower electrode. A brief pulse of focused light knocks
electrons off molecules in the air, blazing a conductive trail for
the discharge to follow. Ideally, the laser pulse triggers a
discharge and guides its path.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers can tell right away whether they've succeeded in
creating a laser-guided arc: Whereas an unguided discharge is
crooked, like a natural lightning bolt, a guided discharge is
perfectly straight, like a beam of laser light.
</P>
<P>
   ``En charge!'' Duguay calls out, and the group prepares for
another strike.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of using lasers to coax lightning strikes has been
around for decades, and Russian and Japanese scientists have long
conducted outdoor experiments with them.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese _ motivated by their vulnerability to low-altitude
winter thunderstorms that sweep across the Sea of Japan and strike
nuclear power plants on the west coast of the main island _ have
taken the lead in triggered-lightning research.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, north of Osaka, a group headed by Shigeaki Uchida of
the Institute for Laser Technology successfully triggered two
outdoor strikes using carbon-dioxide laser beams focused at the tip
of a 150-foot tower. Radar detectors picked up variations in the
electric field from an approaching storm, indicating that a
lightning strike was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   There is a 100-millisecond gap between these preliminary
breakdown signals and the discharge, but the Japanese laser can
generate a channel of charged particles in microseconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The laser is a thousand times faster than the lightning strike
itself,'' Uchida says. ``With one shot of laser, we neutralized the
whole thundercloud.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the most ardent lightening tamers admit that it may take at
least a decade before their work sees practical application.
</P>
<P>
   And with another sharp crack, another bolt of perfectly straight
lab-grown lightning hits home.

   ``En charge!''
</P>
<P>
   With his rallying cry, technician Bruno Duguay throws a switch
to power up a 50-foot generator on the laboratory floor. A display
on the instrument panel ticks off the mounting charge one kilovolt
at a time.
</P>
<P>
   It will take three or four minutes before the generator's
voltage climbs high enough to transfer to the electrodes. In the
glass-walled control room, Duguay and half a dozen colleagues are
supercharged with anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   It's said that lightning never strikes the same place twice. But
the folks here can make it strike the same place 100 times a day.
That place is the high-voltage laboratory run by Canadian power
giant Hydro-Quebec, one of the world's premier facilities for
studying the most shocking electrical phenomena.
</P>
<P>
   The short, straight lightning bolts that dart between the lab's
electrodes are a highly domesticated version of the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Duguay reaches across the instrument panel to sound a warning
blast out on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attention! Ca va claquer!'' (``Look out! It's going to
spark!'')
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, when he pushes a black button on a gray box, the
crack of an arc lights the lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real sound-and-light show,'' says Bruno LaFontaine,
lead scientist on the project.
</P>
<P>
   La Fontaine's group is in the vanguard of international efforts
to tame lightning _ to trigger the strikes and guide them away from
power lines and installations, thus saving electric utilities
millions of dollars a year in outages and damaged equipment.
</P>
<P>
   By shooting laser beams at thunderclouds, the lightning tamers
hope to channel a discharge toward a relatively safe location
before Mother Nature does worse. It's one of those really cool
ideas that seems better suited to science fiction than science.
</P>
<P>
   The setting for La Fontaine's work does nothing to dispel that
impression. Located in the Montreal suburb of Varennes, the
windowless high-voltage lab resembles an alien monolith from
``2001: A Space Odyssey.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the decor is more ``Lost in Space'': pale-blue 150-foot
walls bathed in stark gray light, ceramic towers girded by thick
silver rings, silver domes made up of small round plates like the
compound eyes of an insect.
</P>
<P>
   The electrodes used in the lightning experiments complete the
sci-fi effect. Instead of slender rods, there are two circles of
loose wire mesh suspended from the ceiling like huge trampolines,
one hanging about 20 feet above the other. When sufficient charge
flows to a rod descending from the upper electrode, an arc of
current jumps between their centers.
</P>
<P>
   La Fontaine is demonstrating his latest findings to French
collaborator Anne Bondiou-Clergerie of the Office National d'Etudes
et de Recherches Aerospatiales in Chatillon
</P>
<P>
   Bondiou is an expert on the physics of lightning formation,
which is still poorly understood, she says, even two centuries
after Ben Franklin flew a kite in the rain.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning strikes start in thunderheads when the strong thermal
updrafts that build the towering clouds cause water droplets and
ice crystals to collide, creating positively and negatively charged
particles.
</P>
<P>
   These particles separate by weight and form electric fields
within the cloud as well as between the cloud and the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The fields get amplified around water droplets, creating
electric currents called streamers that coalesce like the
tributaries of a river, forming even more strongly ionized
channels.
</P>
<P>
   These conductive channels propagate downward until a discharge
jumps the gap between the channel and the ground. Then a wave of

<P>
   My wife is fond of saying, ``It's all in your head.'' And
although the phrase can be annoying, she's literally correct. What
my eyes actually see and what my brain decides to tell me I'm
seeing can be two very different things.
</P>
<P>
   We never experience raw reality. Instead, our brains actively
create what we perceive from a blend of external stimuli, our past
experiences and our expectations. We rarely notice this, but when
we do it can come as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you drink a glass of milk thinking it's Coke,
you'll be shocked when your taste buds take over.
</P>
<P>
   An optical illusion can be another indication of the difference
between seeing and perceiving. Consider the shaded figures (see
accompanying slide showing circles), developed by psychophysicist
Vilyanur Ramachandran. Most people would say that the circles on
the left are spheres, while those on the right are cavities.
</P>
<P>
   But turn the page upside down: Now the cavities are spheres, and
the spheres are cavities. These images are actually the same,
except flipped. Our brains assume that any unseen light source is
above _ like the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Now stare at the circles while telling yourself that the light
comes from below: The images will reverse themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Try are two other experiments:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 1: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Extreme _ yet unconscious _ cases of active perception occur
all the time, because the brain continually adjusts for our
movement and that of what we are looking at.
</P>
<P>
   To see this, hold your left hand in front of you, thumb sticking
up, and move it back and forth horizontally. Watch your thumb. Now
hold your thumb still and scan your eyes quickly back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the image of your thumb moves across your
retinas, but only in the first case do you perceive movement.
</P>
<P>
   The perception of motion doesn't necessarily arise from an image
moving across your retina, as you might expect. Instead, it is
controlled by the brain. When the brain knows the eyes are moving,
it nullifies the resulting shift in background to prevent you from
thinking that your environment is moving.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 2: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. To throw this tidy arrangement into chaos, disrupt the
communication between the brain and the eyes. Very gently nudge one
eye as you read this. The text should lurch in the opposite
direction of the nudge.
</P>
<P>
   Your brain didn't command your eye to move in such a way, so it
couldn't compensate for the nudge. When it saw motion on your
retina, it wrongly assumed the world had shifted.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SIDEBAR: EYES WIDE SHUT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Active perception can also work against us, giving too much
credence to what we expect and not enough to what we actually
witness.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one study showed that women forgave attractive
children more quickly than unattractive ones, even for identical
transgressions. Most of us expect good-looking kids to be better
adjusted than homely ones.
</P>
<P>
   So the next time you find yourself dismissing something new
because it doesn't fit with your experiences, give your eye a very
gentle nudge. When the room jumps, remember that we actively
construct our perceptions.

<P>
   LaFontaine's goal is to provoke controlled discharges. His
simulations re-create the charged field of a thundercloud: The rod

   But the lab experiments include another element definitely not
found in nature: a state-of-the-art titanium-sapphire laser whose
light is beamed up from the floor and through a hole in the center
of the lower electrode. A brief pulse of focused light knocks
electrons off molecules in the air, blazing a conductive trail for
the discharge to follow. Ideally, the laser pulse triggers a
discharge and guides its path.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers can tell right away whether they've succeeded in
creating a laser-guided arc: Whereas an unguided discharge is
crooked, like a natural lightning bolt, a guided discharge is
perfectly straight, like a beam of laser light.
</P>
<P>
   ``En charge!'' Duguay calls out, and the group prepares for
another strike.

around for decades, and Russian and Japanese scientists have long
conducted outdoor experiments with them.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese _ motivated by their vulnerability to low-altitude
winter thunderstorms that sweep across the Sea of Japan and strike
nuclear power plants on the west coast of the main island _ have
taken the lead in triggered-lightning research.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, north of Osaka, a group headed by Shigeaki Uchida of
the Institute for Laser Technology successfully triggered two
outdoor strikes using carbon-dioxide laser beams focused at the tip
of a 150-foot tower. Radar detectors picked up variations in the
electric field from an approaching storm, indicating that a
lightning strike was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   There is a 100-millisecond gap between these preliminary
breakdown signals and the discharge, but the Japanese laser can
generate a channel of charged particles in microseconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The laser is a thousand times faster than the lightning strike
itself,'' Uchida says. ``With one shot of laser, we neutralized the
whole thundercloud.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the most ardent lightening tamers admit that it may take at
least a decade before their work sees practical application.
</P>
<P>
   And with another sharp crack, another bolt of perfectly straight
lab-grown lightning hits home.

<P>
   ``En charge!''
</P>
<P>
   With his rallying cry, technician Bruno Duguay throws a switch
to power up a 50-foot generator on the laboratory floor. A display
on the instrument panel ticks off the mounting charge one kilovolt
at a time.
</P>
<P>
   It will take three or four minutes before the generator's
voltage climbs high enough to transfer to the electrodes. In the
glass-walled control room, Duguay and half a dozen colleagues are
supercharged with anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   It's said that lightning never strikes the same place twice. But
the folks here can make it strike the same place 100 times a day.
That place is the high-voltage laboratory run by Canadian power
giant Hydro-Quebec, one of the world's premier facilities for
studying the most shocking electrical phenomena.
</P>
<P>
   The short, straight lightning bolts that dart between the lab's
electrodes are a highly domesticated version of the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Duguay reaches across the instrument panel to sound a warning
blast out on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attention! Ca va claquer!'' (``Look out! It's going to
spark!'')
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, when he pushes a black button on a gray box, the
crack of an arc lights the lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real sound-and-light show,'' says Bruno LaFontaine,
lead scientist on the project.
</P>
<P>
   La Fontaine's group is in the vanguard of international efforts
to tame lightning _ to trigger the strikes and guide them away from
power lines and installations, thus saving electric utilities
millions of dollars a year in outages and damaged equipment.
</P>
<P>
   By shooting laser beams at thunderclouds, the lightning tamers
hope to channel a discharge toward a relatively safe location
before Mother Nature does worse. It's one of those really cool
ideas that seems better suited to science fiction than science.
</P>
<P>
   The setting for La Fontaine's work does nothing to dispel that
impression. Located in the Montreal suburb of Varennes, the
windowless high-voltage lab resembles an alien monolith from
``2001: A Space Odyssey.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the decor is more ``Lost in Space'': pale-blue 150-foot
walls bathed in stark gray light, ceramic towers girded by thick
silver rings, silver domes made up of small round plates like the
compound eyes of an insect.
</P>
<P>
   The electrodes used in the lightning experiments complete the
sci-fi effect. Instead of slender rods, there are two circles of
loose wire mesh suspended from the ceiling like huge trampolines,
one hanging about 20 feet above the other. When sufficient charge
flows to a rod descending from the upper electrode, an arc of
current jumps between their centers.
</P>
<P>
   La Fontaine is demonstrating his latest findings to French
collaborator Anne Bondiou-Clergerie of the Office National d'Etudes
et de Recherches Aerospatiales in Chatillon
</P>
<P>
   Bondiou is an expert on the physics of lightning formation,
which is still poorly understood, she says, even two centuries
after Ben Franklin flew a kite in the rain.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning strikes start in thunderheads when the strong thermal
updrafts that build the towering clouds cause water droplets and
ice crystals to collide, creating positively and negatively charged
particles.
</P>
<P>
   These particles separate by weight and form electric fields
within the cloud as well as between the cloud and the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The fields get amplified around water droplets, creating
electric currents called streamers that coalesce like the
tributaries of a river, forming even more strongly ionized
channels.
</P>
<P>
   These conductive channels propagate downward until a discharge
jumps the gap between the channel and the ground. Then a wave of
current surges upward through the small channel. Bondiou and other
experts call this final, visible stage the ``return stroke.'' The
rest of us call it lightning, and it can carry current of up to
300,000 amperes (household current rarely exceeds 50 amperes).
</P>
<P>
   Lightning rods ground strikes because their pointy edges produce
amplified electric fields that can induce an arc before the
electric field in the cloud grows strong enough to break down
spontaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, electrical energy doesn't discriminate between
inexpensive metal rods and tall, sharp points on valuable
voltage-sensitive equipment. That's why nearly every structure in
the high-voltage lab is protected by rounded surfaces: These
Jetson-esque rings and domes prevent the generation of unintended
local discharges.
</P>

<P>
   My wife is fond of saying, ``It's all in your head.'' And
although the phrase can be annoying, she's literally correct. What
my eyes actually see and what my brain decides to tell me I'm
seeing can be two very different things.
</P>
<P>
   We never experience raw reality. Instead, our brains actively
create what we perceive from a blend of external stimuli, our past
experiences and our expectations. We rarely notice this, but when
we do it can come as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you drink a glass of milk thinking it's Coke,
you'll be shocked when your taste buds take over.
</P>
<P>
   An optical illusion can be another indication of the difference
between seeing and perceiving. Consider the shaded figures (see
accompanying slide showing circles), developed by psychophysicist
Vilyanur Ramachandran. Most people would say that the circles on
the left are spheres, while those on the right are cavities.
</P>
<P>
   But turn the page upside down: Now the cavities are spheres, and
the spheres are cavities. These images are actually the same,
except flipped. Our brains assume that any unseen light source is
above _ like the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Now stare at the circles while telling yourself that the light
comes from below: The images will reverse themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Try are two other experiments:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 1: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Extreme _ yet unconscious _ cases of active perception occur
all the time, because the brain continually adjusts for our
movement and that of what we are looking at.
</P>
<P>
   To see this, hold your left hand in front of you, thumb sticking
up, and move it back and forth horizontally. Watch your thumb. Now
hold your thumb still and scan your eyes quickly back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the image of your thumb moves across your
retinas, but only in the first case do you perceive movement.
</P>
<P>
   The perception of motion doesn't necessarily arise from an image
moving across your retina, as you might expect. Instead, it is
controlled by the brain. When the brain knows the eyes are moving,
it nullifies the resulting shift in background to prevent you from
thinking that your environment is moving.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 2: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. To throw this tidy arrangement into chaos, disrupt the
communication between the brain and the eyes. Very gently nudge one
eye as you read this. The text should lurch in the opposite
direction of the nudge.
</P>
<P>
   Your brain didn't command your eye to move in such a way, so it
couldn't compensate for the nudge. When it saw motion on your
retina, it wrongly assumed the world had shifted.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SIDEBAR: EYES WIDE SHUT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Active perception can also work against us, giving too much
credence to what we expect and not enough to what we actually
witness.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one study showed that women forgave attractive
children more quickly than unattractive ones, even for identical
transgressions. Most of us expect good-looking kids to be better
adjusted than homely ones.
</P>
<P>
   So the next time you find yourself dismissing something new
because it doesn't fit with your experiences, give your eye a very
gentle nudge. When the room jumps, remember that we actively
construct our perceptions.

charged with killing his wife, also the mystery man who stopped a
potentially bloody terrorist attack during the Gulf War with Iraq?
The U.S. government isn't saying, but Abufakher and his attorneys
are. In an effort to get his $1 million bond lowered, attorney Tom
Bath has filed a packet of information in Johnson County District
Court describing Abufakher's claim of 1991 life-risking exploits.
Included in the packet is one government agent's confirmation to
his attorneys that Abufakher is indeed the individual described on
several U.S. State Department web sites who was ``essential in
thwarting the planned terror attacks.'' Tony Rizzo. 35. Photo

</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``MY CAT SPIT MCGEE'' &QL; 
By Willie Morris (Random House, $18.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of any cat hater, this is a major defection.
Morris was a confirmed dog man most of his life. First there was
Skip, about whom Morris wrote a book called ``My Dog Skip,'' and
then there was Pete, a carefree black lab who hung out with the
guys at the local gas station and counted Truman Capote among his
many friends before he settled down with Morris. In the last years
of his life (he died of heart failure this year), however, Willie
Morris loved a cat. Not that he went gently. When he noticed his
faltering resistence to feline company, he consulted with a friend,
the dog-loving Eudora Welty (who was no help), and with a
psychiatrist, who told him it was not unmanly to love a cat. And so
he and Spit McGee became a twosome, Morris spellbound and smitten
and companionable, Spit haughty and all-knowing and coy. This is
Morris' ode to Spit, whom he sometimes believed was his dog Skip
reincarnated. However, Spit was Spit and no one else. Do you have
to love cats to love this book? We'll be honest with you _ it
helps. A little Spit McGee goes a long way. ``This afternoon the
two of us were down by the creek sitting together in our favorite
spot,'' Morris writes. ``It was false spring again in January and
the warming sunlight fell languidly upon us. As I stroked him on
his back, once again he snuggled into my lap. `I love you, Spitty,'
I said. He extended his paw toward me.'' Pete and Skip are probably
spinning in their graves. &QL;

   Get out your hankies, folks. This is a weeper. And yet it's not
a sappy book. We thought it would be, and we opened it with
considerable reluctance. Then we got our hankies out and read to
the last letter in the pile. The people who have written to Reeve
since he was paralyzed in a riding accident four years ago _
especially the strangers _ are not overly sentimental people. They
tend to be survivors themselves, who have faced physical adversity
and come out of it reborn, if not recovered. Their messages tend
toward the challenging. Buck up. Don't let people tell you what you
can't do. Things might never be the same, but make something of the
life you have now. Never give up. Never. Dana Reeve also includes
letters from old acquaintances who knew her husband both as himself
and as Superman, and from celebrities who sent their good wishes
and encouragement. Here's a note, in its entirety, from a
7-year-old boy: ``Hope you'll come out of hospital soon. And you
can come round. Dad will help you up the stair's.'' (cq) Paul
McCartney wrote about the day he and his young son, a huge Superman
fan, traveled on the same plane with Reeve to America from London.
``You were kind enough to give him a big wave when he turned around
to look at you,'' McCartney said. ``That's the kind of thing that
means a lot to soppy old parents like us, and something we won't
forget in a hurry.'' And Katharine Hepburn typed this _ ``Let me
know if I can do anything _ My golly what a mess.'' and signed it
with a very shaky hand. It's hard not to be heartened by the
collective goodness of these people, who took time out of their
days to reach out to a man in need. ``By compiling these letters,''
Reeve says in his foreword, ``Dana is sharing with you and
reminding me of words that helped me start a new life. For that I
am deeply grateful.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``BASEBALL'S 25 GREATEST MOMENTS'' &QL; 
(The Sporting News, $29.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We showed this book to a rabid Pirates fan, who let it be known
that the editors erred deeply when they ranked Bobby Thomson's home
run against the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1951 pennant race over
Pittsburgh second baseman Bill Mazeroski's homer in the last game
of the 1960 World Series. It's that kind of book _ you don't check
your allegiances at the door. Also among the Top 10: the hobbled
Kirk Gibson's home run in the opening game of the 1988 World
Series; Bill Buckner's devastating error in game six of the 1986
series; Don Larsen's perfect game for the Yankees over Brooklyn in
Game Five of the 1956 series; and ``The Catch,'' which Willie Mays
made in 1954 and has been downplayed ever since, but we think it's
just the most amazing thing, so amazing that we could watch it
forever. Our Pirates fan says the first 10 ``greatest moments'' are
fun, but after that the editors make some faulty picks and leave
themselves open to ridicule. As we said, it's that kind of book. &QL; 
``THE WAY WE LIVED THEN'' &QL; 
By Dominick Dunne (Crown, $27.50) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When he was 9, Dunne's aunt took him from his home in
Connecticut on a vacation in the West. Their first stop was Los
Angeles, and when they got onto the bus that toured movie stars
homes, Dunne sat next to the guide so that he wouldn't miss
anything. In truth, he knew more about the stars than the guide did
_ he was already steeped in Hollywood gossip and glamour, the
intrigue and the dirt. Years later, as a young stage manager, he
attended his first Hollywood party at the home of Humphrey Bogart
and Lauren Bacall, where he saw Judy Garland, who lived next door,
and Lana Turner, who lived next door on the other side (she walked
in late, ``looking the way you wanted Lana Turner to look''), Frank
Sinatra, Spencer Tracy and so many others. ``Before the night was
over, people jumped in the pool in their party clothes,'' he says.
``I jumped in, too. I wanted to be a part of it. I thought to
myself, `This is how I want to live.' '' He did, for a long time.
This is his memoir of life in Hollywood, with photographs from his
own scrapbooks showing the stars at leisure.  &QL;

   ANTIGUA, Guatemala _ Diminutive Mayan women with faces that
could grace the cover of National Geographic mill around the
tree-shaded central park, balancing huge baskets filled with
hand-woven fabrics on their heads.
</P>
<P>
   A block away in a cyber cafe, German students hop on the
Internet and flash electronic messages across five time zones.
</P>
<P>
   Along a cobblestone street before the facade of a 400-year-old
church, vendors peddle ``comida tipica'' _ Guatemalan fare of
beans, tortillas and fried platanos _ while nearby a craftsman
spreads his wooden wares on the sidewalk and blows a tune on a
hand-carved flute.
</P>
<P>
   His notes drift toward a nearby bistro, where jazz hums from
hidden speakers as tourists banter in a half-dozen languages, some
smoking fat Cuban cigars and sipping espressos.
</P>
<P>
   Part charming colonial showcase, part slow-paced Guatemalan
mountain town, part hot spot for the international backpacker
crowd, Antigua offers a comfortable, intriguing introduction to the
Central American back country.
</P>
<P>
   Only an hour from the teeming capital of Guatemala City, Antigua
_ the formal name is ``La Antigua Guatemala'' or ``The Old
Guatemala'' _ is worlds away in terms of its architectural beauty,
the quaint feel of its narrow, cobblestone streets and its
easy-going pace of life.
</P>
<P>
   But far from a frontier outpost, you can still sleep in a
five-star hotel _ if you choose _ and find a nightlife of some
sophistication, with fine restaurants, a jazz club or two and
infinitely interesting conversation from the wide array of
travelers attracted to the place.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can go the backpacker's route: sign up for classes at one
of the 50 or more Spanish language schools and live with a
Guatemalan family, paying only $60 a week for room and meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what I expected,'' said British barrister Richard
Gee, 30, who, taking a year off from his wig and gown, landed in
Antigua recently after six months of traipsing through Asia and
other far-flung parts. ``I expected a backwater, but it's really
quite convenient. I have friends in England who would never dream
of roughing it, and they'd be quite comfortable here.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the local accommodations were good enough for the
White House: President Clinton spent a night in Antigua last spring
during a tour of Central America.
</P>
<P>
   The town dates back to the 1540s, and is nestled amidst three
forested volcanic peaks at a cool 5,000 feet above sea level.
Spanish rulers once issued decrees from the stately Palacio de los
Capitanes (Palace of the Captains), which for more than 200 years
served as the provincial capital of a region encompassing
modern-day Nicaragua, Honduras Guatemala and the southern Mexican
state of Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   But Antigua's bane through history has been the occasional
violent earthquakes that have rumbled through the mountains and
destroyed parts of the city. After a particularly vicious quake in
1773, Spanish governors moved the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Antigua lived on, thanks to its scenic beauty and the love of
its residents. In 1944, the national government declared the entire
city a national monument, leading to the preservation of its
architecture and strict limits on new building.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, the United Nations declared Antigua a World Heritage
site.
</P>
<P>
   Some guidebooks list the city as one of the most beautiful in
all of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is now the main industry, and travelers from around the
globe can be spotted almost daily bartering with the Mayan vendors
in the central park or snapping photos of historic buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But along with sightseers, the town has become something of a
magnet for students of the Spanish language. The first schools were
set up more than 20 years ago, and have become extremely popular _
probably due to the gorgeous surroundings and the rock-bottom
prices.
</P>
<P>
   A week of one-to-one instruction, seven hours per day, costs
from $100 to $150, far cheaper than comparable schools in other
Latin countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the best reputation in all of Central America,''
said Jeanne Guthrie, an American who now lives in Costa Rica but
who came to Antigua to learn Spanish. ``I went to a school in Costa
Rica and the instruction here is 100 times better. All we did there
was play.''
</P>
<P>
   The schools tailor their instruction to the individual students'
level. Many people come for weeks or even months at a time,
spending their days laboring through classes, their nights
bar-hopping through the bistros and internet cafes and their
weekends traveling through the rest of Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   The nightlife is far from wild, but agreeable. Fine restaurants
_ many run by foreigners _ offer everything from Italian to Thai
and French food, while several American-style pubs offer beer,
burgers and American sports on satellite television.
</P>
<P>
   A popular spot is the Cafe Condesa, just off the central park,
which is housed in a 400-year-old home. Legend has it that the
Spanish count who once lived there returned from a journey, found
his wife in an amorous repose with the butler, and promptly killed
the servant. The body was buried in one of the home's
two-foot-thick walls, the story goes _ and the bones were
supposedly uncovered by a 1976 earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Other, less historic bars offer entertainment in the form of
videos shown nightly in small rooms packed with overstuffed couches
and chairs. The movies are mostly in English with Spanish
subtitles, which helps students hone their Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   For history buffs, there is a colonial art museum, several
impressive churches and a convent that has been transformed into a
museum.
</P>
<P>
   For the adventurous, there is horseback riding, bicycling,
hiking in the surrounding mountains, golf and whitewater rafting.
Hiking is a bit risky, however, as bandits have been known to hold
up tourists venturing up the nearby volcanoes.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers will find plenty of Mayan handicrafts, jade, silver,
native artwork and other handicrafts. Barter with vendors on the
street, or step into gift shops that range from the kitschy to the
refined.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're a Latin American veteran or a first-time
traveler, Antigua is simply too beautiful to miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a film set, really,'' said Gee, the Brit on extended
holiday. ``It's an interior designer's dream. Around every corner
you've got these great colors, and you're surrounded by these
volcanoes in every direction. It's really quite impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO:
</P>
<P>
   La Antigua, Guatemala or ``The Old Guatemala'' is aptly named,
as guidebooks say the quaint streets, well-preserved colonial
architecture and spectacular views of three surrounding volcanoes
make it one of the most beautiful cities in all of Latin America.
Known also for its Spanish-language schools, Antigua is the perfect
starting point for a Latin American vacation, or a pleasant,
inexpensive place to spend a few weeks or even months learning how
to speak Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  GETTING THERE: Guatemala City, the nation's capital, is served
by American, Continental and Delta, along with TACA and several
other Latin American air carriers, with non-stops from several
major American cities including Miami, Atlanta and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  DOCUMENTS: American residents need only a passport. No visa is
required for tourist stays of less than 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  GETTING AROUND:
</P>
<P>
   Rental cars _ If you plan to tour the entire country, a rental
car is probably the best way to go, although they are expensive,
from US$60 to US$90 per day. You must also be careful as cars are
targets for thieves _ best to stay only at hotels with secured
parking, and be sure to purchase collision/damage waivers.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttles _ If you plan to limit your visit to Antigua, you can
take a shuttle from the Guatemala City airport to Antigua, a trip
of about one hour that should cost from US$15 to US$30. For
information, call the Guatemalan Tourist Commission at
502-331-1333. Once in Antigua, you don't really need a car, as the
historical part of the city is pleasant and small enough for
walking.
</P>
<P>
   Buses _ Taking a public bus on an excursion in Antigua can be an
adventure all on its own. The buses are incredibly cheap _ as
little as US$2 for a several-hour trip _ and are filled with
residents packing children, market produce, luggage and practically
anything else you can imagine. Ask locals where to find the buses _
most leave from a large open lot west of the market. Be prepared to
stand if the bus is crowded and don't take lots of luggage or
valuables _ tourists can be targets for pickpockets.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  CLIMATE: Antigua is located at about 5,000 feet above sea
level. Rainy months are late summer to early fall. A sweater is
probably a good idea, but a must in winter as nighttime
temperatures can drop into the 40s. Days are generally pleasant
year-round, with highs rarely going above 80 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ACCOMMODATIONS: You can stay cheap or expensive. Budget hotels
range from as little as US$5 a night for a shared bathroom to US$15
for rooms with private bathrooms. In the mid-price range, expect to
pay US$30 to US$50 a night, while luxury hotels go for US$75 to
US$125 per night. If you enroll in a language school, they can
arrange a stay with a family, with meals and room going for about
US$60 a week.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  RESTAURANTS: The selection varies widely, from very
inexpensive local spots serving Guatemalan fare of beans, chicken
and rice for US$3 to US$4 to fine dining establishments with
American and European cuisine. Favorites with tourists include the
Rainbow Reading Room and Cafe, a bookstore offering vegetarian
dishes; Cafe Condesa with its opulent courtyard and 400-year-old
building; Cafe Flor for Thai food; Fridas Mexican Restaurant and
Bar and El Sereno, a fine-dining establishment offering
international dishes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SIGHTSEEING: Highlights include the Catedral de Santiago off
the central park, built in 1542 and only partially rebuilt after
devastating earthquakes in 1780 and 1820. Also facing the park is
the Palacio de los Capitanes, which housed the Spanish capital for
200 years when Antigua was the administrative center for a
territory that stretched from Southern Mexico to Nicaragua. On the
north side of the park is the Palacio del Ayuntamiento, the town
hall, which includes a museum of colonial artifacts. The city's
most striking church is La Merced, located three blocks from the
park, which was built in 1548 and rebuilt after numerous
earthquakes. It features a huge fountain said to be one of the
largest in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SPANISH SCHOOLS: Antigua boasts more than 50, which offer a
week of one-on-one instruction, up to seven hours per day, for $100
to $150. For a list of schools, call the Guatemalan Tourist
Commission 502-331-1333 or check a website at:
www.conexion.com/schools.htm
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  EXCURSIONS: One-day tours to places like Lake Atitlan can be
arranged through travel agencies. Tours to Mayan ruins at Copan or
Tikal are also available, as are mountain-biking, whitewater
rafting trips and horseback riding. Among the tour companies are
Adventure Travel Center at 502-832-0162 in Antigua and Maya
Expeditions in Guatemala City at 502-363-4955.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  PRECAUTIONS: It's safest to drink only bottled water and not
to eat food prepared by street vendors. Avoid peeled, uncooked
fruit or vegetables. Be careful with rented cars, parking only in
secured areas, and walk at night only in groups. Bandits have been
known to rob tourists hiking on the volcanoes surrounding Antigua,
so it's probably best to enjoy the view from town.

dishes; Cafe Condesa with its opulent courtyard and 400-year-old
building; Cafe Flor for Thai food; Fridas Mexican Restaurant and
Bar and El Sereno, a fine-dining establishment offering
international dishes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SIGHTSEEING: Highlights include the Catedral de Santiago off
the central park, built in 1542 and only partially rebuilt after
devastating earthquakes in 1780 and 1820. Also facing the park is
the Palacio de los Capitanes, which housed the Spanish capital for
200 years when Antigua was the administrative center for a
territory that stretched from Southern Mexico to Nicaragua. On the
north side of the park is the Palacio del Ayuntamiento, the town
hall, which includes a museum of colonial artifacts. The city's
most striking church is La Merced, located three blocks from the
park, which was built in 1548 and rebuilt after numerous
earthquakes. It features a huge fountain said to be one of the
largest in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SPANISH SCHOOLS: Antigua boasts more than 50, which offer a
week of one-on-one instruction, up to seven hours per day, for $100
to $150. For a list of schools, call the Guatemalan Tourist
Commission 502-331-1333 or check a website at:
www.conexion.com/schools.htm
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  EXCURSIONS: One-day tours to places like Lake Atitlan can be
arranged through travel agencies. Tours to Mayan ruins at Copan or
Tikal are also available, as are mountain-biking, whitewater
rafting trips and horseback riding. Among the tour companies are
Adventure Travel Center at 502-832-0162 in Antigua and Maya
Expeditions in Guatemala City at 502-363-4955.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  PRECAUTIONS: It's safest to drink only bottled water and not
to eat food prepared by street vendors. Avoid peeled, uncooked
fruit or vegetables. Be careful with rented cars, parking only in
secured areas, and walk at night only in groups. Bandits have been
known to rob tourists hiking on the volcanoes surrounding Antigua,
so it's probably best to enjoy the view from town.

S.F. MAYOR FACES LIKELY RUNOFF IN DECEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ILENE LELCHUK and RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ One thing's for certain: San Francisco Mayor
Willie Brown is headed for a runoff in six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The question remains with whom. Ex-Mayor Frank Jordan or Board
of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano?
</P>
<P>
   It won't be former campaign consultant-turned candidate Clint
Reilly, who trailed badly after spending nearly $4 million _ mostly
his own cash _ on his campaign. He all but conceded shortly after
the early first results came in.
</P>
<P>
   F:\NATSan Francisco voters will see either a rematch of the
Brown-Jordan showdown of 1995 or a contest that will be cast as a
race between the consummate machine politician and the City Hall
liberal who most relishes challenging the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at the returns suggests that the race between Jordan
and Ammiano is very close,'' veteran San Francisco pollster David
Binder said early Wednesday morning. ``The ballots may be closely
scrutinized, there may be court challenges. This could be a very
long, drawn-out process.''
</P>
<P>
   The second-place winner behind Brown _ the man who will face the
mayor in the Dec. 14 runoff election _ remained unknown Wednesday
morning after more than 100 tired poll workers ended a long night
and suspended the count of Ammiano's write-in ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Final results were not expected until Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the uncertainty, political pundits and last-minute polls
predict Brown will not win more than 50 percent of the votes, which
will force him into a runoff with the No. 2 vote-getter.
</P>
<P>
   Late, still incomplete results Wednesday morning showed Brown at
48 percent and Jordan with 21 percent in second place among the 18
candidates. But Ammiano's supporters, saying most of his votes had
yet to be counted, were confident he would finish ahead of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's camp is confident that the mayor will face Ammiano, who
entered the race just three weeks ago. Brown's chief campaign
strategist, Jack Davis, said he expects the runoff to be against
Ammiano, whom polls show dominated support in the left-of-center
electorate. Jordan and Reilly split the more conservative votes
with Brown caught in the middle, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Ammiano already was talking as though he secured the spot in
the runoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to strike a deal to keep the negativity to a minimum
so we don't look back after the millennium and say what an ugly
campaign,'' Ammiano said from his campaign headquarters at Josie's
Cabaret and Juice Joint in the Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, looking ahead to the runoff, clearly aimed his election
night speech at Ammiano, without naming names.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, one of the nation's most liberal politicians, will define
himself as a centrist and try to paint Ammiano as being out of
touch with the city's majority. Ammiano has made a career taking on
big business, fighting for tenants and urging better pay for
minimum-wage earners.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said his campaign will showcase his ability to bring San
Francisco's varying _ and often warring factions _ together, naming
landlords and tenants, downtown and the neighborhoods, corporate
San Francisco and neighborhood business interests and the mix of
ethnic communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must be prepared to build a bridge between all the people
that exist in this city to make it work,'' Brown said. ``To be the
mayor of this city, that's a requirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano said he's up to that challenge and will reach beyond his
traditional base to conservative west-side voters who might be more
comfortable with a candidate like Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can reach out by appealing to their sense of good
government and the need of checks and balances on City Hall,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the idea of a runoff is a comedown for Brown, who four
years ago as California's most powerful Democrat captured the
imagination of the city's voters as he trounced Jordan and brought
a new spirit to City Hall. Now, despite a booming economy, Brown is
beset by problems such as homelessness, an FBI probe of city
agencies and a public weary of his arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, whose popularity rating has plummeted during his last
three years in office, conceded that during his four-year term he
hasn't been able to resolve all the city's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I have fallen short of what I can do,'' he said.
``But my shortness is a giant step above these other persons who
are seeking this job.''

PASS THE BUTTER WITH FAMOUS AUTHORS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you've got a yen to quiz attorney Christopher
Darden about the O.J. Simpson trial, to talk weight discrimination
with actress Camryn Manheim, or to talk fiction with writers
Barbara Taylor Bradford, Judith Krantz and Jackie Collins, you can
do it _ if you can write a big enough check.
</P>
<P>
   A chance to dine with a famous author is pricey _ $300 just for
a chance to hobnob with !ital!any!off! author, or $2,500 to chow
down with the author of your choice.
</P>
<P>
   But the money is going to a good cause: children's reading
programs throughout the Los Angeles County library system.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 5,000 seats are available at 62 dinner tables
throughout the Los Angeles area, at which volunteer hosts and
hostesses will each welcome one of 62 well-known authors and 10 to
24 paying guests for an evening of food, conversation and
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Seats for the Nov. 8 dinners are going fast, but about 100 spots
are still unfilled, said Jane Ackerman, president of the Council of
the Library Foundation, the library's fund-raising arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We promise to get everybody a good author _ and a good
dinner,'' said Ackerman, who's hosting a dinner at her Pasadena
home with talk-show host and author Christine Ferrare along with 24
others. ``A lot of people don't really care that much about the
dinner. They just want to mix. They want to talk books.''
</P>
<P>
   For her dinner, which she'll have catred, she'll extend her
dining-room table to its limits, ``and I'll put Christine Ferrare
smack in the middle so she can talk to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Those invited to one of the dinners will also be welcome at a
Nov. 7 reception and buffet dinner _ hosted by library supporters
Gregory Peck and his wife Veronique _ at the Central Library in
downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Peck, who performs in a reading series twice a year at the
Central Library, said he's happy to lend his support to something
as important as reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a reader, from the age of 6 when I got my
first library card in La Jolla, where I was born,'' the actor said.
``I've found that it stimulates my imagination and broadens my
horizons and raises my standards of excellence that I set for
myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a book, you can go anywhere your imagination takes you.''
</P>
<P>
   Other authors who agreed to mingle with book fans over dinner
include Stephen Birmingham, Betsy Bloomingdale, Arlene Dahl, Fannie
Flagg, Larry Gelbart, David Halberstam, Arianna Huffington, Bill
Maher, Leonard Maltin, Gail Sheehy and George Takei.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time the Library Foundation has staged a
dinner-with-the-authors evening. The first event, two years ago to
celebrate the library's 125th anniversary, raised about $350,000
for kids' library programs. This year's event _ dubbed ``Turn of
the Century Dinners'' as an early celebration of the new millennium
_ aims to raise more than $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the fund-raiser is to provide books and reading
programs so every child in Los Angeles can improve reading skills.
And if the children are interested in reading, that may also draw
their parents into the libraries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we know that 50 percent of Americans have trouble
reading, and in Los Angeles, that figure is 60 percent,'' Ackerman
said. ``If we can't educate our children, what does that say about
us as a society?'' &QL;

VOTERS IN S.F. MAYORAL RACE MAKE A STATEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As the fog and an early twilight sent a chill
over San Francisco, Laurie Cantagallo emerged from her polling
place in a neighborhood church frustrated, disgusted and with a
purpose: Get Willie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the whole reason I'm here,'' said Cantagallo, 35. ``It
was just his overall self-serving quality. I thought it was
important to come out against him. I voted for the guy who's the
artist. I don't even know his name. (A.D. Wyatt Norton.) It was a
vote for anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco voters, notoriously fickle and occasionally
vindictive, went to the polls Tuesday with nothing but bitterness.
In dozens of interviews at polling places throughout the city,
voters complained about their choices and gave only muted support
for the mayor when his name came up.
</P>
<P>
   Ick.
</P>
<P>
   Blah.
</P>
<P>
   Clown.
</P>
<P>
   Slimy.
</P>
<P>
   Cronyism.
</P>
<P>
   Those were a few of the words that came from voters asked to
describe the mayoral race and the general feeling they got from
this off-year election, which was marked by record spending levels,
a new plateau of nastiness and a surprise write-in candidacy from
Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano that seemed to energize
more liberal voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a joke. It was a total mess,'' said Jessica Brinkman,
28, a travel consultant who was voted with her husband, Pete. ``I
just thought it got to be too much bashing, so I just voted for the
person I heard from the least _ I voted for Frank Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   The obvious unhappiness displayed by many voters kept Brown from
winning re-election outright, but he still drew support from all
corners of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Voters still see Brown as adept at getting San Francisco what it
needs from the state and federal governments. Once considered the
most powerful Democrat in the state, his influence still carried
cachet with voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of things you don't know, that don't get
published,'' said George LaBar. ``There are a lot of things he can
do with one phone call, to Sacramento, to Washington, that would
take somebody else months to cultivate the kinds of contacts he
has. I don't know anybody else in local politics who could do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pete Brinkman, 29, was more critical in his assessment of
the mayor, whom his wife derisively called ``the world class
mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Down in central part of the city, voters had a different message
for Brown: Grab a pen. Unlike the more conservative voters in the
outer areas, these more liberal voters seemed overwhelmingly
supportive of Ammiano's write-in campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Eight booths were set up in the back of Cafe International,
where citizens could grab an iced chai and ginger-spice cookie and
cast their votes. Most everyone was also ordering Ammiano for
mayor, although voters in other areas dismissed his campaign as too
late, too stealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad Ammiano got in, because otherwise it was looking
pretty grim,'' said Brad Bulger, 41, sporting green hair and black
jeans. ``I mean, I would have voted for Brown if it came down to
it, but it was sort of ick.''
</P>
<P>
   The churning San Francisco economy and sky-popping rents
motivated George Clapper, 51, a photographer and former Bank of
America employee, to vote for the more liberal Ammiano even though
he hasn't been thrilled with his performance as a supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hard one, I think. I voted for Willie Brown the first
time around,'' Clapper said. ``But now I'm not so sure anymore
because I feel I'm one of those people that if my landlord jacks my
rent up too high, I'm out of the city after 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I see the city changing too drastically. It's nice
it's getting cleaned up. It's beautiful, it's wonderful. But those
of us who have worked hard and done stuff are going to be out of
here. So I did a write in, only to cause a runoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bitterness toward Brown, it wasn't too hard to find
his supporters. Aaron Doo, 28, said he expected the mudslinging as
a natural part of any campaign. ``It's part of the circus,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel San Francisco is very diverse, and it's also a very
exciting city, and Brown is the one I would want to represent the
city,'' Doo said.
</P>
<P>
   But more than electing a mayor Tuesday, the vote seemed to be
about making a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very little ways to exert any pressure on them,''
said Christine Joy, 50, a receptionist and word processor. Joy said
she had voted for a lesser-known candidate for mayor, whom she
wouldn't reveal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're supposed to be representing you,'' Joy said of
politicians, ``but in fact they are going to their black-tie
dinners with big shots. There is no way to do it except to make the
`anti' statement.''

TOO SUNNY, `ANNIE' ADOPTS IN-THE-CLOUDS VIEW OF LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If ever a show was meant to sit in the
sanitized-for-your-protection vault of the Disney archives, it is
``Annie.'' Think about it. How can something whose signature song
promises a 100 percent chance of sun not be Disneyfied?
</P>
<P>
   Consider it done.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen years after John Huston directed a lavishly bloated
film of the Broadway musical, ABC's ``Wonderful World of Disney''
has its own pared-down ``Annie,'' premiering Sunday night in the
first weekend of the November ratings sweep. With the optimism of a
Palm Springs weatherman and the earnestness of a Palm Sunday
preacher, it assures us that, by gum, the sun'll come out ad
infinitum. But, as with karma and cholesterol, there's good
sunlight and bad sunlight. Good sun is illuminating. Bad sun is
blinding.
</P>
<P>
   This new ``Annie,'' pleasant in the extreme, illuminates only
the barest outline of the story, leaving such incidentals as
character development and background exposition to our imagination.
More distressing: In the interest of political correctness, its
sunny disposition diminishes the morality tale of goodness
triumphing over evil because the truly bad people, specifically the
orphan-phobic Miss Hannigan and the pre-epiphanic Daddy Warbucks,
aren't the least bit disagreeable, and the circumstances
surrounding everyone are obscured by a things-aren't-all-that-bad
veil of denial.
</P>
<P>
   What remains is a two-hour music video of the ``Annie''
playlist, featuring a cast in very good voice doing some very
familiar songs. But shouldn't there be a more compelling reason to
do a remake? While the 1982 film was overinflated by a factor of
forgettable, it did have the lushness and depth often absent from a
TV treatment where budget and time limitations make it difficult to
match the big picture of the big picture.
</P>
<P>
   What's really odd is that executive producers Craig Zadan and
Neil Meron, who did last season's multiethnic retelling of
``Cinderella'' for Disney/ABC, have promised an ``Annie'' unlike
any other, one that's ``more emotional, funnier and more real.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Meat Loaf who said two out of three ain't bad, and in
baseball even one out of three might get you to the Hall of Fame.
But Zadan and Meron are zero for three on their bold promise: no
emotion, scant humor and, well, a warped sense of reality that
makes the Great Depresssion seem like a Minor Disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Bates, a terrific actress (and a pretty fair singer),
obviously has fun in the role of the inhospitable orphanage keeper,
Miss Hannigan, but her performance pales alongside Carol Burnett's
darkly comic, scene-stealing portrayal in the Huston film. Broadway
veteran Victor Garber is less appealing as Daddy Warbucks, though
it's probably not his fault. Zadan and Meron's superficial
adaptation doesn't give Garber a chance to convey the momentous
personality shift _ from greedy, heartless corporate titan to
compassionate, caring adoptive parent _ that is at the heart of
``Annie.''
</P>
<P>
   Little Orphan Annie herself is a wide-eyed charmer in the person
of 12-year-old Alicia Morton, who won the part over 3,000 other
hopefuls, according to ABC. But she's working in a vacuum created
by the production's insistence on PC modification, the worst of it
reserved for the happily-ever-after conclusion, when Warbucks
formally adopts Annie and gives an engagement ring to Grace
Farrell, his loyal and adoring assistant.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think a big smooch would ensue. But Warbucks and Grace
(Audra McDonald) share only a hug, which wouldn't raise a red flag
if this production weren't so intent on sidestepping controversy.
But because McDonald is an actress of color, the absence of a kiss
between Grace and her husband-to-be serves only to highlight the
chickenhearted blandness of an unnecessary remake.

   This is ``a banner year'' for enrolling first-year black
students at Texas's public law schools, but 90 percent of them are
attending one school -- historically black Texas Southern
University, state higher education officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Educators say the scant enrollment of blacks at predominantly
white law schools shows how the end of affirmative action in
college admissions still hampers minority enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 212 blacks are first-year law students among the four
state-supported schools. In 1997, only 159 blacks began law
studies. That was a year after Texas colleges dropped race as an
admissions factor because of a reverse-discrimination court ruling
against the University of Texas law school. The case is being
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 6 percent of first-year black law students in Texas
are attending the University of Houston law school. Elsewhere, 3
percent enrolled at UT law school, and 1 percent enrolled at Texas
Tech University's law school.

   ``It is clear that these schools are still struggling with
minority recruitment,'' said Lynn Rodriguez, gen{

<TEXT>
<P>
   With loyalty no longer guaranteed and competition for skilled
workers at its highest level ever, companies are doing all they can
to keep employees happy, productive, stress free, and committed to
their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   At Lightbridge Inc., a Burlington telecommunications software
and service provider, chief executive Pam Reeve has contracted with
an art therapy group, Raw Art of Lynn, to help employees in the
firm's Massachusetts and Colorado offices explore their creative
sides.
</P>
<P>
   At PricewaterhouseCoopers, 800 partners will be flown from
offices around the country to the Don Cesar Beach Resort in St.
Petersburg, Fla., for a two-day stress management seminar that
begins next month. The company's cost: $3,500 per person.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, an engineering and architectural-design firm in
June began offering what some might consider the ultimate benefit,
leased BMWs for every full-time employee who has been with the firm
a year or more. Thus far, ARCNET has offered the cars to 31 of its
45 workers, from secretaries and drafters to architects and design
engineers.
</P>
<P>
   With national turnover rates as high as 35 percent in some
industries, many employers are finding that the biggest problem
they face is keeping workers on the job.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of National Affairs Inc., a labor research group and
think tank, reports that while turnover has leveled off in the last
few quarters, the rate remains high. In the first quarter of 1999,
median resignation rates averaged 1.1 percent of the work force per
month, the same as the 13-year high reported a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, employers are tailoring benefits to meet the needs
of their workers and coming up with innovative perks to inspire
loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are increasingly seeing companies trying to figure out what
their people would like to do in their free time and then finding
ways to enable employees to be involved in a particular activity,''
said Marilyn Farley, a benefits consultant at Hewitt Associates in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   This desire to please is not simply a matter of being nice, she
added. ``It's become a real competitive need.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Kepner-Tregoe, a New Jersey consulting firm, found
when it surveyed 1,300 managers and employees this year. Of those
polled, more than 60 percent reported that turnover rates at their
firms had increased since 1996. More than half said the loss of
workers had led to declines in quality and customer service and had
resulted in extra marketing costs.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts believe that the job-hopping trend is parly a
reaction to the downsizing that characterized much of the decade.
``There is now a free-agent mentality that has changed how
employees view their relationships with employers,'' said John
Challenger, president of Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, an
outplacement firm in Chicago. ``What that free-agent mentality
suggests is that you should always be open to change and that it is
better to be proactive than reactive.''
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of the Internet, ``people now see their skills
as permanently up for auction,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that his business would suffer if he did not do
something to stop big clients from wooing his workers, ARCNET owner
Al Galdi this year spent $7,000 on leasing and insurance for each
of 31 employees who qualified for the BMW benefit. The money he
spent on the cars, he said, was about a third of the $900,000 he
was spending annually to recruit skilled people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd hire people, and we'd train them, and then, 18 to 20
months later, they'd gone off to a big telecommunications company
for a bigger salary,'' Galdi said. Thus far, the perk seems to be
working, but the jury is still out, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One software firm, SAS Institute of Kerry, N.C., reports a
turnover rate of less than 5 percent in an industry in which
turnover has been 22 percent a year. The reason: An emphasis on
family and personal time and a 36-hour work week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have stock options or enormous salaries,'' said
spokesman Ed Levens. ``But we do have a work environment that
treats employees like they are adults and gives them the
opportunity to be creative and have a life.''
</P>
<P>
   Levens said SAS founder James H. Goodnight instituted the
36-hour work week when the company opened 22 years ago. The reason?
Goodnight wanted to have dinner with his family and felt his
employees ought to be able to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Reeve, president of Lightbridge, credits an open corporate
culture and work environment with helping her retain skilled
software and technical staff in an industry whose turnover has
soared to 35 percent. Reeve's firm, with 560 employees, provides
software and services to telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent visit, a group of employees in the company's
arts and crafts room decorated shoes with spangles, paint, yarn,
glitter, buttons, and beads. They attached signs saying, ``Step
into my shoes and feel . . . '' or ``No one can walk in my shoes
because . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   With 450 people to supervise, Ellie Ward rarely turns off her
cell phone and pager. But when Lightbridge began collaborating with
Raw Art, a nonprofit art therapy program that uses art to mentor
troubled teens, Ward got involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to manage reservation centers for another company, and
it was always the business goals, the business goals,'' said the
34-year-old director of TeleServices. ``Here, they don't want a
70-hour person sitting in the office getting fried. They really
don't want people to burn out. They know they'll lose them.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's relaxed atmosphere appears to be keeping workers
happy, Reeve said. ``We have people who have been here since the
firm was founded 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hewitt Associates polled 742 US employers recently, it
found that many are offering benefits designed to reduce stress and
help workers cope with the demands of the job. Of those polled, 22
percent offer massage therapy, a perk that was virtually
nonexistent five years ago. In all, 28 percent now offer
telecommuting, up from 20 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   For workers in fast-paced industries, stress and burnout are
serious concerns. So serious, in fact, that PricewaterhouseCoopers
is sending its partners to a stress management seminar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our philosophy is that a less stressed worker is a greater
asset to the firm,'' said Kathryn M. Franklin, head of the
consultancy's workplace quality lab in Washington, D.C. ``They are
more effective, more productive, more loyal to the firm, and they
stay longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Kipp, a 40-year-old partner in the company's ethics
department in Boston, took part in a pilot program at the firm in
March. ``That said to me the firm cares about me and wanted me to
pay attention to myself and learn how to manage my own stress,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   How effective are these new perks? Studies suggest that, even
with the perks, job hopping is fast becoming the norm, according to
a 1998 report by the National Research Bureau. It found that, on
average, US employees are changing jobs every three or four years.
Not surprisingly, those most likely to switch jobs are young,
high-tech professionals whose skills are constantly in demand.
</P>
<P>
   When assessing the reasons for high turnover among such workers,
the Bureau of National Affairs found that many are motivated by the
thrill of working with a new product or exploring new technology.
For technical workers, the BNA concluded, a stimulating and
challenging work environment may be central to retention.
</P>
<P>
   In its study, ``Avoiding the Brain Drain: What Companies Are
Doing to Lock in Their Talent,'' Kepner-Tregoe reported the most
important benefits employers can offer are fair, uniform
performance standards and an atmosphere that helps employees
balance work and family lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``While no one would be foolish enough to argue that money
doesn't matter,'' the report said, ``much of the recent research,
including our own, shows that the most fundamental thing is to
create an environment that will motivate people, that will make
them excited and enthusiastic about the work they do and the
organization they're a part of.''

IN THIS SCHOOL, MORALITY IS THE MESSAGE

<P>
   FRANKLINTON, Louisiana _ Niceness is hip now at Franklinton High
School.
</P>
<P>
   The nasty rite of passage of jeering freshmen at football
rallies is gone. This autumn: no boos. Youths in this rural town 65
miles northeast of New Orleans admonish one another when they say
something ``sucks.'' There are fewer fights, more thank yous, and
teachers say the hallways are silent between classes.
</P>
<P>
   Students everwhere need to become as polite, many school
officials say. As character education is promoted nationwide as a
solution for eroding morals _ presidential candidate George W. Bush
this week pushed for ``moral education'' in schools _ state
educators will gather next month to establish guidelines for
teaching students the tenents of kindness, politeness, and respect.
</P>
<P>
   At Franklinton High, the approach is part science, part
sociology experiment.
</P>
<P>
   School officials have shied away from popular programs that
allot 45 minutes to instill courage in a student before moving onto
decimals and fractions.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers roll their eyes at Louisiana's new law requiring young
students to call teachers ``Ma'am'' or ``Sir.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Franklinton is targeting and retraining student
leaders, from almost every clique, to act as role models for the
rest of the school. Teachers mentor students through angst and
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps, most important, students help make school rules,
and punishments, ensuring everyone plays a role in the politeness
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like in any organization. You have maybe 20 percent of
people that will always be negative and another 20 percent that
will be positive, and nothing you can do will sway either group,''
said Stephanie Nugent, a Franklinton guidance counselor who was
instrumental in devising the school's character education program,
which was recognized as the best in Louisiana this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you have that 60 percent, and that is what we are going
for,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics have long doubted values can be learned in school. Even
if they can, many say, formulas like Franklinton's cannot be
mimicked successfully: School cultures are too complex to have a
cookie-cutter approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no mathematical precision to it. It's not like there
is a tipping point to create this, like having 15 good people out
of 30 people,'' said Dan Monti, a professor of sociology at Boston
University and author of ``The American City,'' a study of civic
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't teach character any more than you can teach a child
how to win a race. Schools can reinforce values, but what you have
to do is create situations to practice those ideals,'' Monti said.
</P>
<P>
   While some claim it is misplaced nostalgia, many educators and
politicians say public schools are more unruly, unmanageable, and
disrespectful than years ago. Schools now must educate every child,
regardless of attitude or anger.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, many of these students would be thrown out of
schools.
</P>
<P>
   And years ago, schools enforced moral messages students were
hearing from parents, aunts, the community: Lying is bad. Be nice
to your friends. Don't cheat. Break those codes, and punishment
came swiftly from parents or school officials.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, schools stopped focusing on telling children what
was right and wrong. Teachers were urged to discuss what morals
were and how students could create their own value system.
</P>
<P>
   Now, experts say, the new trend is to emphasize group
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 50s, it was more teachers saying the golden rule,''
said Mary Mindess, a professor of child psychology at Lesley
College in Cambridge. ``Right now we are trying to help people
construct for themselves a world to live well in.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklinton High certainly needed a better world.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, principal Beverly Young said, fights had
escalated and cursing was heard frequently.. Following the
Columbine school shootings in Colorado last year, a homemade bomb
was found in the ticket booth during graduation ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny town of 4,200 was shocked to find its school was
suffering from some of the same blights that strike large cities.
Franklinton looks like America's hometown: Last month workers and
volunteers were busy tying cornstalks to lightpoles and creating
``pumpkin men'' on street corners for the country's biggest free
agricultural fair.
</P>
<P>
   Religion is prominent. Several months ago town officials erected
signs saying ``Jesus is Lord over Franklinton'' on the four main
roads leading to the community. ``Nobody has ever complained,''
said Faye Boyd, city clerk.. ``It's just an indication of what the
town believes in.''
</P>
<P>
   But those beliefs broke down in the high school. With more
single-parent households, more poverty, and more families from New
Orleans lured by cheap rent and land, school staff said they
realized they had to teach values families usually instilled in
children.
</P>
<P>
   Nugent, who began teaching English at Franklinton last year,
noticed how little personal responsibility the youths were taking
for everything, from academic performance to behavior. But instead
of telling them how to behave, she had them devise rules of conduct
and punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't complain about the punishment because they
created it,'' she said. The class came up with words they should
not use and reminded one another not to say them.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Nugent set out to instill the value system in
every teacher, in every class, even in announcements over the
public address system.
</P>
<P>
   She reminded teachers that school rules forbid smoking, so
students should not find adults sneaking a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   Same with cursing. Students were given appointment books with
definitions on every page for values such as compassion and
forgiveness. A homeroom period was created for students to write in
journals about how they and their peers behave and ways to improve.
</P>
<P>
   The little things do not change a culture, but everything
contributes, Nugent insisted.
</P>
<P>
   And while she agrees each school has to come up with its own
character education program, she says it is vital the state help
fund the effort to sustain it for new teachers and students.
</P>
<P>
   While the Massachusetts state Department of Education will give
schools help and guidelines to develop programs, character
education will not be a required course like math or English, said
David Driscoll, state education commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Students at Franklinton High said it has only been a year since
they began being kind to one another, but they are noticing a
change.
</P>
<P>
   Freshmen say they cannot get away with being disrespectful,
because upperclassmen and teachers call them on it.
</P>
<P>
   Upperclassmen say they are trying to behave better as examples
to the younger students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids really do respect each other now. You think about how the
other person feels,'' said Jessica Barber, a junior.
</P>
<P>
   She points to the pep rally as a clear sign Franklinton High is
a new school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all used to boo the freshmen. It was just something
everyone did. But they taught us how most everyone knows what it
feels like to be a freshman. Now, no one wants to boo them
anymore.''

AT HALF TIME, PATRIOTS ROLLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ At this rate the Patriots will be 12-4;
that's the simple math. The road to that in the second half
involves a more complicated formula that includes games with Miami,
Indianapolis, Dallas, and two with Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have caught good breaks in the first-half schedule,
playing teams at some of their lower moments, but they've also
taken advantage of most of the situations.
</P>
<P>
   The close wins, and even the close losses, have given the
Patriots the feeling that they can play with anyone. They've lost
two games by 3 total points to two very tough teams, Kansas City
and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, the Patriots don't have it all together quite yet, but
they're getting close. They have had the semblance of a running
game the past two weeks, and they didn't suffer the October swoon
that plagued them the last two years. Their dip lasted two weeks,
and they know it shouldn't have lasted that long.
</P>
<P>
   At the break, the Patriots are 6-2, and their star players are
healthy. Here's a closer look at why they are among the best teams
in the league:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
QUARTERBACK &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Drew Bledsoe is the best in the league, completing 60.5 percent
of his passes for 2,314 yards, with 13 touchdowns and only four
interceptions. The one concern is his getting hit too much _ 50
knockdowns in the first eight games, tops in the NFL. Bledsoe will
have a week to rest his weary bones and if the Patriots maintain
the balanced attack they have shown the past two weeks, his health
and well-being should not be as big of an issue.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
RECEIVERS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The coaching staff wanted to utilize the talents of Terry Glenn,
Shawn Jefferson, Troy Brown, and Tony Simmons, and the quartet has
been productive. Glenn, with 43 receptions (18.1 yards per catch)
is having an All-Pro season, evident by the extra attention he's
been receiving. Jefferson is still fast and can get open. Simmons
hasn't been on the field much, though he has broken a couple of big
plays, and Vincent Brisby has gone from the inactive list to
proving a capable fill-in for the injured Brown (ankle).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
RUNNING BACKS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Terry Allen is a good, heady runner. He's gained 512 yards on
130 carries (3.9-yard average), which is precisely the production
you want from your lead back. But at some point, Kevin Faulk has to
emerge as the featured back. The Patriots have also been thin at
fullback, where Tony Carter has done a good job having to handle
the full load. The Patriots haven't been able to find a way to keep
Chris Floyd, a good blocker, healthy. Lamont Warren has fulfilled
the third-down back role, and he may have a greater role as a
receiver in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIGHT END &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ben Coates has 16 catches in eight games, which has caused a
stir. The Patriots do not feature the tight end because they like
to get the ball to their speedy receivers. As the season
progresses, Rod Rutledge's role will increase not only as a blocker
but as a receiver, because the Patriots want to be ready if they're
going to make a tough decision at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
OFFENSIVE LINE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can count on one hand the offensive lines in the NFL that
can both pass and run block. The others are all better in one area
than the other. Such was the case with the Patriots in many of
their first-half games. But lately the ``attitude'' has seemed to
come back, as the commitment to the run has enabled the Patriots to
amass 133- and 140-yard rushing totals. Bruce Armstrong is having a
strong season at left tackle, center Damien Woody has exceeded
expectations with his quickness and his ability to adapt to the NFL
game, and Todd Rucci and Zefross Moss have been consistent. Heath
Irwin's pulling ability has also been a factor in the run game,
while Max Lane, the line's super sub on the line, has handled a
very difficult role be lending a great deal of stability.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DEFENSIVE LINE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ``rotation'' Ray Hamilton has implemented on the defensive
line has begun to kick in. Willie McGinest is having a huge year at
the elephant spot, while Chad Eaton and Henry Thomas, both of whom
got off to slow starts, have become forces again in the middle.
Ferric Collons was an effective run-stopper vs. Arizona, and
Brandon Mitchell is beginning to get penetration on pass plays. The
Patriots like Greg Spires's nose for the quarterback, and he'll be
plugged into the defense in more than just nickel situations the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
LINEBACKERS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bo Pelini deserves a special commendation for keeping this
unit afloat given the injuries they've sustained. Pelini has done
an excellent job bringing along rookie Andy Katzenmoyer, who had to
shift late in training camp from the weakside to the middle. Chris
Slade may be having his best season, and Tedy Bruschi has proven to
be an every-down player who is on his way to an offseason score in
the free agent market. The Patriots need the injured guys (Marty
Moore, Vernon Crawford, and Bernard Russ) to return to add depth.
Look for Ted Johnson sometime in December, and when he does,
they'll have to find away to keep Johnson and Katzenmoyer sharp.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SECONDARY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You just get the feeling that Ty Law (two interceptions) is
going to have a huge second half. Law has been restricted much of
the first half by some of the zones the Patriots played. Steve
Israel is a very solid, productive player at the other corner.
Lawyer Milloy is having a better year than he did last season (when
he got to his first Pro Bowl). Each game the unit seems to get a
little tighter with its coverage. The second half is huge to free
safety Chris Carter, who must step out of his conservative approach
and trust his athleticism more.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SPECIAL TEAMS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots lucked out with punter Lee Johnson, who was signed
after they'd lost Tom Tupa to the Jets. Johnson, 37, has been
remarkably efficient landing his kicks inside the 20-yard line.
Adam Vinatieri has booted his way out of a brief slump, where he
missed three straight field goals _ including a 32-yarder in Kansas
City that would have given the Patriots a last-minute win. Faulk
has shown some wiggle and burst on kicks and punts, but Brown's
play-breaking moves have been missed. Cover teams have been
decimated because of injuries, but a healthy Tebucky Jones returned
in Arizona last week and made three big tackles.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
COACHING &QL;
</P>

   A head coach is measured by wins and losses. Carroll is 6-2 and
has done a good job instilling his enthusiasm in the team. Carroll
and his coordinators have often made good halftime adjustments. As
Bill Parcells always says, ``You are what you are.'' Right now, the
Patriots, Carroll, and the players are pretty good.

`SEATTLE' A CHIEF COMPETITOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ Saratoga in August is the place and time to
see outstanding 2-year-olds break their maiden. Horsemen who race
in the East save their best juveniles for The Spa, when interest
peaks. Only good horses win maiden special weight races at
Saratoga, and only potential stars, such as Chief Seattle, win by
nearly 10 lengths. Despite having just the one victory in three
starts, Chief Seattle comes into Saturday's $1 million Breeders'
Cup Juvenile at Gulfstream Park as one of the choices.
</P>
<P>
   A son of Seattle Slew, out of the cleverly named
Skatingonthinice, a daughter of Icecapade, Chief Seattle caused a
stir by winning so impressively in his debut Aug. 25. He went right
from that maiden tally to the Grade I Futurity at Belmont Sept. 19.
He stumbled at the start of the Futurity, then was steadied late,
finishing fourth. But he was beaten by just 1 1/4 lengths overall.
Next came Belmont's Grade I Champagne Oct. 9. This time, Chief
Seattle went right to the front, and he looked like a winner in
midstretch. However, Greenwood Lake, a late runner, made up 20
lengths in just over a half mile to catch him.
</P>
<P>
   John Kimmel, 45, who trains Chief Seattle, is one of the
up-and-coming conditioners in the game, and is in the Top 10 in the
national trainer standings, with over $4 million won this year.
Kimmel, who is from Rumson, N.J., is a graduate of the University
of Pennsylvania veterinary school, had his own practice before
becoming a trainer, and knows his stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing great,'' said Kimmel. ``In the Futurity, he
stumbled at the break, and got behind a wall of horses. (Regular
rider) Edgar (Prado) tried to get him to the outside, but all of
the horses in front of him drifted out. If he had gone inside,
Chief Seattle would have won the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Champagne, I didn't want Chief Seattle to get into the
same scenario. So we sent him. He went through a decent first
quarter (:23 4/5, going a mile and 1/16th, the same distance as the
Juvenile) just on his own. Then he went through a fast second
quarter (:22 3/5), while he put High Yield (who finished third and
is also a Juvenile contender) away. Then he just came off the
bridle; he didn't even try once he got ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a funny horse. I can't do much with him in the morning.
He is very competitive, and he needs another horse to make him
work. Greenwood Lake jumped him, but Chief Seattle had a lot of gas
left in the tank, there was plenty of horse left. We won't run into
that problem in this race, because there are plenty of horses to
carry him. I wouldn't trade places with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Seattle is owned by Kentucky horsemen William Betz and
Philip Needham. They bought him as a weanling for $145,000 at the
1997 Keeneland November sale. They put him up for sale as a
yearling, but when he failed to achieve his reserve (the minimum
asking price), they bought him back for $150,000, and wound up with
one of the best 2-year-olds in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwood Lake is not going to race in the Breeders' Cup, even
though he was pre-entered. His trainer, Nick Zito, winters at
Gulfstream and knows the racing surface is not conducive to deep
closers. Greenwood Lake will race in the Remsen at Aqueduct Nov.
27, instead, and that means Chief Seattle leads the Eastern
contingent in what is a very competitive event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about the other New York horses,'' said
Kimmel. ``The West Coast horses _ Captain Steve, Dixie Union,
Forest Camp _ are the ones that are the main competition as I would
handicap the race. And the horse from Calder (Kiss a Native, who is
3-for-3, with a total winning margin of 36 lengths) has a shot.
They are asking a lot of him, but the horses from Calder have run
some big races in the past years the Breeders' Cup has been at
Gulfstream (1989 and '92). We'll see.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a boaster or arrogant about my own horses, but Chief
Seattle is doing good and he looks right. He's still immature about
some of the things he has to do, but, when he gets the point, there
aren't going to be too many horses who are going to be able to beat
him. He's a brilliant mover. He does things so easily. As I said, I
wouldn't change places with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;

</P>
<P>
   It poured rain here Tuesday morning, but then cleared out
nicely, and the long range forecast is good. The main track was,
however, sloppy for workouts, and the ``dogs'' (sawhorses to keep
runners off the rail as the track drains to the inside) were up.
Six Breeders' Cup hopefuls were out for exercise despite the wet
track. They were Sprint contestant Affirmed Success, also trained
by Kimmel, who went three furlongs in :37, breezing; Enjoy The
Moment, also a Sprint aspirant, who cantered four furlongs in :50,
breezing, and Postponed, an also-eligible in the Juvenile, who
covered four panels in :47 2/5, breezing. Also out for an airing
were Almutawakel, who zipped five furlongs in 1:00 3/5, breezing,
in preperation for the Classic; Daylami, the favorite for the Turf,
who went five panels in 1:01, breezing, and Banshee Breeze, a key
Distaff contender, who negotiated the same distance in 1:01 4/5,
breezing.

DISTRICT ATTORNEY RUNOFF A '95 REMATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SETH ROSENFELD, PETER HARTLAUB and JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The bitter battle for district attorney appeared
headed for a potentially nasty runoff between liberal incumbent
Terence Hallinan and former prosecutor Bill Fazio, in a repeat of
their close 1995 showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Votes tallied early Wednesday showed Fazio in the lead with 45
percent of the votes compared to 34 percent for Hallinan.
</P>
<P>
   Both Hallinan and Fazio said they'd expected to face each other
in a Dec. 14 runoff and vowed a tough rematch. In their 1995
election battle, Hallinan received 52 percent of the vote to
Fazio's 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought there had to be a runoff ... because it's
been me against four guys and the newspapers,'' Hallinan said early
Wednesday at his balloon-festooned campaign headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief speech Tuesday night, Hallinan told about 150
supporters there he would rout Fazio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got more energy. We've got more enthusiasm. We've got
more belief in what we're doing than Fazio does,'' said Hallinan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four more years! Four more years!'' the crowd chanted in
response.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, Fazio told some 250 supporters that he'd realized a
runoff was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the next six weeks are going to be very, very
busy,'' Fazio told the crowd at about 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have positioned ourselves and are poised for victory in
December,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The showdown could turn personal and ugly, several observers
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has the potential to become a pretty nasty runoff,'' said
Del Ali, of Research 2000, who conducted a poll on the district
attorney's race last week.
</P>
<P>
   That poll found Fazio leading Hallinan with support of 34
percent of those surveyed, compared to 24 percent for Hallinan.
</P>
<P>
   The other candidates each garnered less than 5 percent, and 29
percent of those polled were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   But just as significant, Ali said, were the main candidates'
negative ratings: 44 percent of those surveyed viewed Hallinan as
``unfavorable,'' while 24 percent saw Fazio that way.
</P>
<P>
   That means Hallinan must emphasize Fazio's negatives, and
convince people who voted Tuesday for other candidates to support
the incumbent, Ali said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Hallinan has to do is demonize Fazio,'' Ali said. ``He
has to convince voters to vote for the devil they know instead of
the devil they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Hallinan noted he has a tough fight ahead, but said, ``Hopefully
we can stick to policy issues, because that's where I think I can
beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people will see that Fazio is too conservative for San
Francisco. And that will raise his negatives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't intend to get personal,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney earns $139,899 per year and oversees an
office with a $26.4 million budget and 115 assistant district
attorneys who prosecute state crimes ranging from illegal pot
possession to murder. The district attorney sets priorities on
which cases to prosecute and when to settle them before trial.
</P>
<P>
   Hallinan has come under assault from his opponents despite a
substantial drop in crime during his four-year tenure.
</P>
<P>
   FBI statistics showed that violent crime and serious property
crime declined 11 percent from 1997 to 1998, nearly twice the
national decrease.
</P>
<P>
   While Hallinan has not claimed full credit for the drop, he says
his policies have contributed to it.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of highly charged debates, Hallinan's opponents
criticized his conviction rate, his handling of particular cases
and some of his public disputes with local judges.
</P>
<P>
   But none said they'd scrap a host of Hallinan's progressive
programs, promising instead to improve them.
</P>
<P>
   Those programs have been a key part of Hallinan's
administration. They include diversion programs that let drug
users, prostitutes and welfare mothers avoid misdemeanor
convictions if they complete probation and rehabilitation courses.
</P>
<P>
   Hallinan has emphasized prosecution of domestic violence cases
and other violent crimes. His office has won 15 of the 17 homicide
cases it took to trial this year.
</P>
<P>
   Though Hallinan won praise for diversifying the largely white
and male office, and for hiring some bright and energetic
prosecutors, he was criticized for not always providing sufficient
training to his new hires.
</P>
<P>
   The staunch liberal also encountered resistance from
rank-and-file police officers, who endorsed Fazio in the last
election as they did in this one.
</P>
<P>
   Hallinan, 62, is a San Francisco native and son of the late
radical criminal defense lawyer Vincent Hallinan.
</P>
<P>
   He says he opposes the death penalty, and will instead seek life
without parole for the most violent criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Fazio, 51, also a native San Franciscan, was a prosecutor in San
Francisco for more than two decades, working mostly on felony
cases.
</P>
<P>
   He has built support in the more conservative districts and has
won endorsements from the Police Officers Association, the
Republican Party and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, a staunch
law-and-order advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Fazio was a criminal defense lawyer the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   He has contended that Hallinan is ``temperamentally unsuited''
to be district attorney. And he's said he'd put in more experienced
prosecutors for high-profile cases.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his conservative tag, Fazio is a Democrat. He has vowed
to keep most of Hallinan's diversion programs, adding others. And,
like Hallinan, Fazio says he favors medical marijuana.

SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 
 CORRECTS byline, ADDS tagline  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVEN ANN WILLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We seem to have kicked up a bit of a dust storm with our
editorial on Sunday titled ``McCain's temper is legitimate issue:
Hull's account of outbursts not unusual.'' It's been the topic of
national television and print news accounts for several days now.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the networks' new focus on what most Arizonans
consider to be an old issue has been riddled with inaccuracies and
misinformation. Let's set the record straight.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his band of backers have sought to spin this
editorial as evidence of a ``grudge match'' this paper has with the
senator. Several in the national media have jumped on board,
portraying the editorial as part of a ``vendetta'' against McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Vendetta?
</P>
<P>
   McCain has run for office five times since he moved to Arizona.
This newspaper has endorsed his candidacy all five times, most
recently just a year ago, shortly after I became editor of these
pages. McCain sat down with editorial board members and his
Democratic opponent for nearly two hours to discuss key issues in
the race and our questions about the candidates' positions on them.
At the conclusion of the meeting, McCain thanked us for the
``fairness'' we accorded him. Two of his staffers later caught up
to me to convey precisely the same message.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, we've applauded McCain on these pages many times over
the years, including just last week for his role in seeking an
amendment to legislation having to do with quiet aircraft over the
Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   We supported McCain's efforts to open several major airports to
certain long-distance flights and to deregulate certain aspects of
the telecommunications industry. We've backed McCain's bold and
dignified leadership on re-establishing relations with Vietnam,
made all the more poignant by McCain's personal experiences as a
prisoner of war. We've commended his strong and knowledgeable
leadership on many national defense issues, most recently during
the Kosovo upheaval. We've lauded McCain's stances against
congressional pork and embraced portions of his call for campaign
reform.
</P>
<P>
   This newspaper published an exceptionally evenhanded 16-page
special section on McCain just last month titled ``The Life Story
of Arizona's Maverick Senator'' that provoked not a peep of peeve
from the McCain camp. Heck, we even sported a front-page feature
last June on McCain's spunky mom _ a piece McCain critics blasted
as a puffery designed to promote the candidacy of the hometown
candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   Vendetta? Right, and the Grand Canyon is in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, we've also been critical of McCain. We criticized his role
in the Keating Five scandal, in which McCain was cited by the
Senate Ethics Committee for exercising ``poor judgment.'' And we
chastised his handling of the announcement of his wife's drug
addiction _ a problem that McCain acknowledged he didn't know about
until after Cindy McCain kicked the habit. (Cindy McCain's
admission that she stole painkillers from her own charity to
support her habit was the subject of a hard-hitting but hardly
unfair cartoon on these pages, so enraging McCain that it was years
before he returned phone calls from ``Republic'' staffers.) We've
banged on him more recently for a tasteless joke about Chelsea
Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we've been critical of McCain's volatility and his public
belittling of people with whom he disagrees _ whether they are
former Gov. Rose Mofford at a hearing in Washington, the Jewish man
he lambasted for objecting to McCain's speech referring to
``Christian'' compassion for the homeless, or a public reference to
the Leisure World retirement community as ``Seizure World.'' If
McCain comes unglued over this sort of local scrutiny, what can we
expect once the national scrutiny kicks in?
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his backers also have sought to paint Sunday's
editorial as part of an orchestrated campaign by Texas Gov. George
W. Bush to undermine McCain's campaign for president. Again,
patently untrue. Here are the facts:
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the ``New York Times'' published a front-page story
about McCain's testy relations with Arizona Gov. Jane Hull, the
state's other top Republican officeholder, who described McCain's
difficulty in controlling his temper. It was followed by a critical
column by a member of the ``Wall Street Journa''l's editorial
board. In those pieces, McCain pleaded guilty to passion but
insisted he doesn't ``insult anybody or fly off the handle or
anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a debate about the virtues of passion. There are
many. This was an editorial correcting a statement McCain made
about his own conduct in those national pieces, a statement that
many in Arizona who have worked with him over the past 17 years
know to be simply untrue. We at ``The Republic'' may be
old-fashioned, but we believe that, as the major newspaper that
probably knows McCain best, we have an obligation to set the record
straight and provide as full and complete a picture of John McCain
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is McCain has ``insulted'' people and ``flown off the
handle.''
</P>
<P>
   To portray responsible journalism as puppetry to a rival
candidate is yet another example of the unfounded, sarcastic and
condescending charges to which McCain, unfortunately, is prone.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. McCain is alleging that the ``New York Times''
news pages, the ``Wall Street Journa''l's editorial pages (we all
know how close those two are), ``The Arizona Republic,'' Gov. Hull
and just about anybody else who criticizes him all take their
marching orders from the governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   That's absurd.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, the national discussion of all this so far has been
exceedingly disappointing. It's been characterized by half-truths
and untruths.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about passion, vendettas or candidate manipulation.
It's about character _ the issue around which McCain himself has
wrapped his campaign. It shouldn't come as a surprise that there
are more faces to McCain's character than the simplistic one he and
his backers are working so hard to put forward. &QL;

   BOSTON _ He remembers when Sheboygan was in the league and
blacks weren't. He remembers when there was no 24-second clock,
when Eddie Gottlieb scribbled the schedule on scraps of paper, when
the playoffs ended in April and players sold insurance during the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get to be my age, you can't remember what you had for
breakfast,'' Red Auerbach says. ``But I could tell you stories from
50 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been half a century since the man with the Brooklyn
accent and the argyle socks came to Causeway Street and took over a
wobbly basketball team that was losing games and money at a
dizzying pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics were a shamrock on a shirt in 1950. By 1966,
Auerbach had made them into a dynasty, winning nine NBA titles in
10 years before moving to the front office, where he won another
seven.
</P>
<P>
   He is 82 now and still the club's vice chairman, still puffing
on his trademark cigar, still the symbol of the game's most storied
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the Godfather of the Celtics,'' says John Havlicek.
</P>
<P>
   A bronze statue of Auerbach has been in Quincy Market since
1985, the same year his mythical number (2) was hoisted to the
rafters of Boston Garden. He was voted into the Basketball Hall of
Fame more than three decades ago. And while the hat he wears now
may be largely ceremonial, the Celtics without Auerbach are
unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was only one guy who was with one organization as long
as Red has been,'' says Tom Heinsohn, emcee of a tribute to
Auerbach at the Celtics' home opener against Washington (Nov. 3).
``That was Connie Mack with the Philadelphia Athletics _ and he
owned the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach never owned the Celtics (though he did get a 10 percent
stake after Walter Brown died), but for more than a decade he was
the Celtics. He was general manager, coach, traveling secretary,
scout, marketing director _ all without a contract.
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach signed one with Brown (``Because I didn't know him'')
for $10,000 and a piece of the nonexistent profits. The rest was
all done on a nod and a handshake.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were always people in Walter's office, so we'd go in the
men's room to talk,'' Auerbach recalls. ``He'd say, `What do you
want?' I'd say, `Am I working next year?' `Of course you're working
next year,' he'd say. `Why, do you want a raise?' Sometimes, I'd
say, `Yeah, I do want a raise.' Other times, when we didn't make
any money, I wouldn't ask for anything more.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early '50s, the Celtics were a fragile franchise in a
dance-hall league. Seven of the NBA's 17 franchises folded before
the end of 1950-51 season. Only three of the remaining 10 (Boston,
New York, and Philadelphia) had been around since the league began
in 1946, and the Celtics had lost nearly half a million dollars in
four years.
</P>
<P>
   They were a basketball team in a hockey town, playing in front
of nearly 10,000 empty seats at the Garden. Brown had already
mortgaged his house and sold most of his Ice Capades stock to keep
the team afloat. Once, when Auerbach brought two players on the
road and didn't use then, Brown gave him hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``What am I paying 10 men for,'' Brown said, ``if you're going
to lose with eight?''
</P>
<P>
   There was never enough money, and Auerbach knew that as well as
anybody. If he was a one-man band, it was because he had to be.
Auerbach had no assistant coach. If he missed a practice or a game
(``to my knowledge, I never did''), the players would have to coach
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach had no scouts. He either watched college prospects
himself, usually when they played at Madison Square Garden, or took
the word of a trusted confidant.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had a game in Boston on Wednesday and a game in Chicago
on Friday, I'd have a practice on Thursday morning then go to New
York or Philadelphia and watch a doubleheader,'' Auerbach recalls.
``Then I'd go by myself to Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   On the road, Auerbach handled the hotel bills and parceled out
expense money with an accountant's eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Red's cab fare to the hotel was $2.85 and yours was $3.25
because the driver took a different way, you still only got
$2.85,'' says Heinsohn.
</P>
<P>
   And if someone was missing and his squad needed a 10th man to
scrimmage, Auerbach would dust off his old set shot and step in.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd be out there on these spindly little legs, trying to
drive to the hoop,'' Havlicek remembers. ``People would foul him
and block his shots _ and he'd foul the hell out of them at the
other end.''
</P>
<P>
   But always, the red-haired man from Brooklyn was at the center
of the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the only voice,'' says Tom Sanders, who played half a
dozen years for Auerbach and ended up coaching the club. ``It was
Red's show. Walter Brown had given him complete control.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brown was an arena manager who carried the bottom line in his
head. He knew ice shows and rodeos, track meets and come-to-Jesus
meetings. But he didn't know basketball, and he admitted it. So
Brown left everything to Auerbach: drafting, signing, trading,
coaching, marketing, even proselytizing.
</P>
<P>
   James Naismith had nailed his peach baskets to the wall down the
road in Springfield and Holy Cross had brought the NCAA title to
Worcester, but basketball in New England was still little more than
an indoor diversion when Auerbach arrived.
</P>
<P>
   So he took to the road like a traveling salesman, giving hoop
primers to anybody who wanted one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a truck, and in the back of the truck I had a basket,''
Auerbach says. ``We'd go to supermarkets and give a clinic in the
parking lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach literally wrote the book on the sport: ``Basketball For
the Player, the Fan and the Coach.'' It was a simple game, he said,
and building a winning team wasn't complicated. You found good
players, got them in shape, taught them a basic system, and let
them go to work. Auerbach just happened to do that better than
anybody else in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arnold knew how to judge talent, he knew how to acquire it,
and he knew how to motivate it,'' says Bob Cousy, who played 13
years for Auerbach and won half a dozen championship rings.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was better at finding collegiate gems _ like Bill
Russell, Sam and K.C. Jones, Havlicek, Sanders _ whom others had
overlooked or undervalued.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was better at horse-trading to get them. Dealing Ed
Macauley and a draft pick (Cliff Hagan) to St. Louis for the right
to draft Russell was arguably the best move in league history.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody was better at getting them to play more for pride
than for money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red created an atmosphere that allowed as many players as
possible to do what they did best,'' Russell says.
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach might have had complete control, but he was no
dictator.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understood that the greatest use of power is not to use
it,'' says Russell, who succeeded Auerbach as coach.
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach had all the natural leverage he needed. He controlled
the playing time, and there was no free agency and no rival league.
He had no need to play the martinet for effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some coaches have to show every day that they're in control,''
Auerbach says. ``That's a sign of weakness in my book.''
</P>
<P>
   His players were superb athletes who had been to college and
were playing the game for money. Why not treat them as
professionals? They knew they were supposed to arrive in camp fit
and ready to run. So if they were overweight, Auerbach told them,
it was their fault. If they pulled a muscle, it was their fault.
Threw up? Their fault.

 HARBORSIDE, Maine: ... to oldies.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Damrosch and Coleman live their philosophy to the hilt. ``We
love eating with the seasons,'' she says. ``I have no cans of food.
Just salt, pepper, oil, vinegar, and mustard. I might buy something
like capers.'' She also buys pasta and whole grains. They grow
their own beans and buy some from the local co-op, where they also
get Vermont cream and milk. ``We'll get a cow eventually.
Ultimately, we'll raise all our own livestock,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Can they keep it up all winter?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone seems to think of it as a camping trip,'' she says,
``but we eat more the way people used to eat. Our diet is just as
varied in the winter as it is in the summer. There's no great
effort. We have fresh fish. This is the coast of Maine, so we get
wonderful crab meat, Maine shrimp, lobsters, obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   Damrosch brings fresh herbs indoors, which gives her rosemary,
sage, and bay through the winter. There is sorrel in the
greenhouse. She dries mint and lemon verbena (for tea). ``Chives
stay green practically all winter in the garden,'' she says. ``We
find them under the snow.''
</P>
<P>
   They have the luxury of shopping in their own greenhouses, a
commercial root cellar, and another cellar in their house. Those
add to the larder celeriac, beets, potatoes, storage carrots,
cabbage, kohlrabi, onions, garlic, winter squash, sweet potatoes,
and apples.
</P>
<P>
   A freezer holds tomatoes (but no other vegetables), locally made
sausages, homemade chicken stock, and maybe a whole animal, ``if
the meat was taken care of in a responsible way,'' Damrosch says.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman would not have bought the freezer. ``I took matters into
my own hands,'' Damrosch says, a phrase she repeats now and again _
usually at the tail end of a discussion in which Coleman is being
highly principled about something. In this case, taking matters in
hand meant going out to buy a small ecological freezer a year ago.
Now they have ice cubes and ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The house is too small for them, since both have offices and
they buy more and more books wherever they go. So they'll build a
bigger one soon, and it's hard to tell whether that plan will go
into effect before or after the livestock. And, oh yes, a vineyard
is somewhere in the future.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many books in the large room that serves as
kitchen, dining, and sitting room that it's like living inside a
library. It smells wonderfully smoky. Several breads are warming in
the wood-fueled oven (the sole source of heat, hot water, and
cooking).
</P>
<P>
   A soup made from Damrosch's vegetables is simmering on the stove
_ a puree of tomatoes, butternut squash, celery, leeks, onions,
garlic, and homemade stock mixed with thick cream. She is also
making sauce from the juice of grapes she found growing wild at a
neighbor's, which will be poured over their figs later at lunch. A
dining table in one corner of the room is covered with a floral
cloth that looks Provencal and set with intensely colorful
Fioriware.
</P>
<P>
   The house is very stylish but not self-conscious.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Damrosch grew up in Manhattan. Both parents were
gardeners, and she learned from them at their country house in
Connecticut. She spent 12 years at Brearley, a private school where
the girls were known as ``the tomboys of the debutante set.'' Then
Wheaton College, which was all women at the time. ``I should have
gone to a big coed school.''
</P>
<P>
   She did finally, setting to work on a doctorate in medieval
literature at Columbia. ``I got halfway through my dissertation on
Chaucer's pagan goddesses and quit,'' she says. She taught college
for a while and freelanced for The Village Voice, The Nation, and
Esquire on ``literary, feminist, political topics _ whatever women
were writing about at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   She was raising a son by herself and left the city for the clear
air and land in Connecticut. She moved next door to her childhood
country house, became a landscape designer, and began writing
books.
</P>
<P>
   One day in July 1991, she drove up to Blue Hill, Maine, where
her 85-year-old mother lives in a retirement community, and decided
to visit Helen Nearing and to find Eliot Coleman. She had known
about him and he about her. ``I liked his book, and I thought he
was awfully cute,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had written to me,'' says Coleman, ``and I answered
because I liked her book and I saw her photograph.'' When she
stopped by Helen Nearing's, Coleman was working in the greenhouse.
``There was strong interest at first sight,'' she says. They
married five months later, the third time for both.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman is rugged and handsome. Damrosch looks as if she might
have danced or modeled when she was younger. They're about the same
size, and they share strong opinions, a sense of irony, and a
passion for books. ``Eliot is a mountaineer and a white-water
kayaker,'' she says. ``I come from a lot more artistic,
intellectual background. We end up liking the same people and
places and experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   They have a community of friends who live on their stretch of
the road. Some bought adjacent land that Coleman sold off from the
original Nearing acres. (Sale price: the same $33 per acre the
Nearings paid in the 1950s.)
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night is sauna night, which ends with a plunge in the
pond, even in midwinter, and a potluck dinner. Their friends, she
says, are all ``very alternative. Lots of fiddlers and singing on
the back porch. We think Cape Rosier is the center of the
universe.''
</P>
<P>
   So it isn't as isolated as it looks. Still, there are stretches
in the winter when Damrosch and Coleman are in the fields all day
together, then writing on their off days, and each other's only
company the rest of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Do you have to be madly in love, a visitor asks them, to live
out here and do this?
</P>
<P>
   He answers. ``No,'' he says. ``But it helps.''
</P>

<HEADLINE>
A BANNER SHOPPING SEASON IS EXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As retailers gear up for what's expected to be one of the best
holiday seasons of the decade, consumers should heed the 12 myths
of holiday shopping.
</P>
<P>
   But first, a quick overview of the season. So long as the stock
market doesn't crash and the Federal Reserve doesn't sharply raise
interest rates, the retail outlook is nearly all gold,
frankincense, and myrrh.
</P>
<P>
   The National Retail Federation projects holiday retail sales to
rise 6 to 6.5 percent above last year's spending of $172.8 billion,
to $184 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has the potential to be one of the best holidays of the
decade,'' says regional marketing director Laurel Sibert of the
Simon Property Group, which manages such Massachusetts properties
as Burlington Mall and South Shore Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Sibert is not alone in this view. ``Cautiously optimistic'' is
generally the phrase retailers trot out about this time of year
when asked to assess the upcoming holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this year, I'd remove the word cautious,'' says marketing
director Bob Gottlieb of S.R. Weiner and Associates, which manages
the Mall at Chestnut Hill in Boston and other area malls.
</P>
<P>
   About the only bad news on the horizon is a labor shortage that
should make it hard for retailers to hire temporary help.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could be a huge problem,'' says president Jon Hurst, of
the Retailers Association of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Herewith 12 myths of the 1999 holidays:
</P>
<P>
   Myth 1: Y2K fears could put a damper on the '99 season.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, nobody knows what impact the Y2K computer glitch
will have on shopping. But one observer believes Y2K could take
holiday shopping into extra innings this year.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a theory outlined by Malachy Kavanagh, a spokesman for
the International Council of Shopping Centers:
</P>
<P>
   Deciding to take no chances, many consumers will withdraw $500
to $1,000 from the bank to ensure they'll have extra cash on hand
when the millennium arrives. Then Jan. 1 dawns, and there are no
big Y2K problems. Ditto for Jan. 2 and 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you going to put that $500 back in the bank, or are you
going to go out and spend it?'' Kavanagh asks.
</P>
<P>
   Kavanagh thinks many people will spend it, and the strong sales
retailers have enjoyed in the week after Christmas in recent years
could go on into January.
</P>
<P>
   Myth 2: Hot holiday toys burst from out of the blue.
</P>
<P>
   In general, hot toys are variations on old themes or toys that
have sold well all year. Anything related to the Pokemon craze has
been on fire and that should continu Rhode Island toy maker Hasbro Inc. is keen on Pokedex, a kind of
Rolodex for storing Pokemon monster cards; it also has high hopes
for a talking I-Choose-You Pikachu plush toy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Yule hits of yore are back with new looks. Tickle Me
Elmo is now Rock &AMP; Roll Elmo with a light-up guitar. Not to be
outdone, Furby has spawned Furby Babies.
</P>
<P>
   If a Hollywood movie is a hit with kids, look for movie-inspired
toys to show up on store shelves. Stores should bulge this holiday
season with ``Star Wars'' action figures and products related to
the soon-to-be-released ``Toy Story 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Advances in technology can lead to some surprise toy hits.
</P>
<P>
   A laser tennis game has generated much buzz, as has Amazing
Ally, a doll with a memory bank that enables Ally to tell jokes,
play games, and remember an owner's favorite foods.
</P>
<P>
   The same rule applies to other products: If it's hot all year,
it will be hot during the holidays. Expect DVD players and clothes
from Old Navy and Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch to be big sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Myth 3: Shopping on line is easier than going to the mall.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this will be true someday. But last holiday season, the
year that on-line shopping supposedly went mainstream, the crush of
consumers overwhelmed some retail Web sites, and other sites left
many consumers so frustrated they didn't buy anything.
</P>
<P>
   Buying on line is supposed to save time and stress. But some
consumers simply swapped one set of hassles for another.
</P>
<P>
   In part because many consumers and Web retailers have a year of
on-line experience under their belts, on-line shopping should be
easier in 1999, a Deloitte &AMP; Touche survey predicts.
</P>
<P>
   This view, however, is not universally shared. On-line
experiences are likely to be hit or miss. Some Web sites will rate
high marks, while others will make crowded malls look good. In any
case, Jupiter Communications predicts holiday consumers will spend
about $5 billion at retail Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   That's nearly double last year's level, but just under 3 percent
of total holiday sales; on-line consumers are expected to spend
another $1 billion on holiday travel and vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Myth 4: The day after Thanksgiving is the busiest shopping day
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Many consumers now shop as late as they can. Either two-income
households are so pressed for time that they put everything off
till the last minute, or consumers believe stores will slash prices
and they'll pay less if they wait.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, four of the five busiest shopping days of 1998
occurred in the week before Christmas, according to the
International Council of Shopping Centers, and the Saturday before
Christmas is often the year's busiest day.
</P>
<P>
   Myth 5: Holiday goods arrive in stores earlier every year.
</P>
<P>
   It only seems that way. With Halloween now a $5 billion retail
holiday, many malls aren't bringing in the Santas till they've sold
a pile of candy and costumes.
</P>
<P>
   The past few years, Christmas merchandise has started arriving
in late October and early November. The goal is to get consumers to
shop earlier. But that tactic doesn't seem to be working very well.
(See Myth 4.)
</P>
<P>
   Myth 6: Toy makers make hot toys scarce to stir up demand.
</P>
<P>
   Toy makers may try to manipulate supply and demand, but few
succeed, in part because many toys are made in Asian factories,
says M. Eric Johnson, a professor at the Amos Tuck School of
Business Administration at Dartmouth College.
</P>
<P>
   The logistics of shipping toys over thousands of miles require
lead times of 18 months to two years, and that makes it awfully
tough to engineer a toy frenzy, Johnson says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creating fad products is an inexact science,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Unpredictable events can sometimes cause toy shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Asian currency crisis slowed shipping traffic
between Asian and US ports, affecting some toy sales, and this year
an earthquake in Taiwan could be a problem, says Toy Book publisher
Jim Silver. Taiwan produces many of the computer chips that animate
this year's crop of high-tech toys, he says, and a slowdown in chip
production could lead to some delays and scarcities.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro had hoped to add an interactive Yoda to its ``Star Wars''
holiday line, but disruptions in Taiwan will delay Yoda's debut
until early next year, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Myth 7: A jittery stock market could slow consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   If the market crashes, all bets are off. But holiday shoppers
aren't always daunted by volatile Octobers on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two years, nervous retailers low-balled their
forecasts only to see final results exceed expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Though some consumers are getting anxious about the future _ as
reflected in consumer confidence surveys _ low unemployment, low
inflation, and rising wages suggest that robust spending could well
continue.
</P>
<P>
   According to an American Express survey, consumers spent an
average of $1,148 during the 1998 holidays, about 15 percent more
than in 1997. That amount could rise again in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Myth 8: Internet retailers are clobbering catalog companies.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, says Maxwell Sroge of Maxwell Sroge &AMP; Co., an Illinois
firm that tracks the catalog industry.
</P>
<P>
   Sales by companies that mail catalogs to consumers are projected
to increase 12 to 15 percent this year, a pace that should be
matched during the holidays, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Sroge estimates consumers will buy about $135 billion in
merchandise from catalog retailers in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Many venerable catalog companies, including L.L. Bean Inc. and
Lands' End Inc., also operate retail Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sroge, such sites are helping catalog companies
reach new customers while allowing them to cut costs by mailing
fewer catalogs. Says Sroge, ``The Internet is increasing the
efficiency of the catalog companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Myth 9: By Christmas Eve, the public should know whether
retailers will enjoy a strong holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily. With consumers shopping later and later, the
true measure of the season may not be known until retailers release
their fourth-quarter earnings in February or March.
</P>
<P>
   Through the hard experience of past holidays, many retailers
have become more efficient. By keeping inventories low and
carefully planning promotional sales, many of them have learned how
to squeeze strong profits out of modest sales gains.
</P>
<P>
   Myth 10: Holiday spending is higher than ever.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, consumers tended to spend in concentrated
bursts in November and December. Now, in an age of instant
gratification, many consumers spend freely and steadily year round,
so that holiday spending accounts for a smaller percentage of
overall spending than it did a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there is a trend to elongate shopping habits
throughout the year,'' says Bruce Van Kleeck, vice president of the
National Retail Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Once department stores were the chief beneficiary of holiday
spending. Now many consumers spend much of their holiday dollars
elsewhere, a boon for travel agents, hotels, and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Myth 11: Weather can ruin a retailer's holiday.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, a weekend-before-Christmas blizzard should be a
retailer's worst nighmare because it leaves all those last-minute
shoppers snowbound. But weather isn't always critical.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, an unseasonable hot spell in November and early
December hurt sales of winter overcoats and apparel. However, a
strong finish made for a solid overall season.
</P>
<P>
   Myth 12: Victoria's Secret will be deserted on Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   As a general rule, men regard shopping as a chore that should be
at the bottom of any to-do list. So for them, shopping can be a
last-minute affair, eliminating the option of on-line ordering. Men
want gifts that are lightweight and easy to carry. Often that
translates into jewelry, perfume _ and the type of naughty nighties
sold at Victoria's Secret.

   Conditioning, fundamentals, execution, teamwork. What else was
there?
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to overcomplicate it,'' says Cousy. ``You set
up the structure, but let the talent express itself. Arnold knew
how to win with the least amount of wasted motion. That was the
essence. He got it done without a lot of French pastry.''

   Seven basic plays, with options off each. Short, intense

   ``I could do everything I needed in an hour,'' Auerbach says.
``I tried to make the practices interesting instead of drudgery.
Competitive games. The five big men against the five little men.
Things like that. I didn't think they needed two hours. Because

<P>
   By 1965, most of the Celtics had been listening to Auerbach's
nicotine-cured growl for the better part of a decade. Not that they
objected to it. How could you object to an annual ritual of
champions' checks, bejeweled rings, and champagne?
</P>
<P>
   But Auerbach was worn down from all the years of multiple
identities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was burned out,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   So he gave his rivals a year's notice: one last chance to shove
the Redhead's cigar down his throat.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1966, after an eighth straight flag, Auerbach turned the
coaching job over to Russell and watched, literally, from the other
side of the Garden. Auerbach didn't want anyone saying that he was
pulling his successor's strings from behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red never came to practice unless I asked him to,'' Russell
says. ``He said, `You're the coach.' Because that was the way
Walter Brown had been with him.''
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty for Auerbach to do in the front office. Brown
had died in 1964, the ownership was shaky, and the core of the
dynasty _ Cousy, Heinsohn, Russell, Frank Ramsey, Sam and K.C.
Jones _ was gone or going. Lean years were on the horizon and
Auerbach's role was to rebuild from behind a desk and keep the
interregnum short.
</P>
<P>
   It was no different from what he'd always done, finding talent
and figuring inventive ways to acquire it. Auerbach had always
relished finding heirlooms (like Don Nelson and Bailey Howell) at
rummage sales. He enjoyed picking up merchandise for a bargain
price when nobody else realized it was available.
</P>
<P>
   He'd always had the blood of the Levantine merchant in him. When
Auerbach went overseas on State Departement tours, he haunted the
marketplaces playing ``Let's Make A Deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved to go to the bazaars in Egypt and haggle,'' Heinsohn
says. ``It was a ritual with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach got Jo Jo White in 1969 because White was military
draft bait and other clubs were reluctant to take a chance.
Auerbach drafted him, then got White into a reserve unit. Almost
nobody outside of Tallahassee knew who Dave Cowens was because
Florida State was on probation and off TV. Auerbach did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got us a hoss,'' Auerbach concluded, watching Cowens yank
down rebounds in rookie camp.
</P>
<P>
   So it went, as Auerbach supervised one Reconstruction, then
another. He traded the rights to Charlie Scott for Paul Silas. He
drafted Larry Bird as a junior and waited a year for him while five
other clubs passed, preferring instant gratification. He dealt two
draft picks to Golden State and ended up with Robert Parish and
Kevin McHale. He drafted Danny Ainge when everybody else figured
he'd play baseball.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most important thing, more than the deals, was that Auerbach
was still working on Causeway Street, decade after decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having him there told the world that the Celtics were a stable
situation,'' says Sanders, now the NBA's vice president for player
programs. ``Auerbach's still in place, the Celtics are still in
place, so business is still being taken care of.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners came and went: Jack Waldron, Marvin Kratter, Woody
Erdman, Bob Schmertz, Irv Levin, John Y. Brown, Harry Mangurian.
Auerbach almost went, too, in 1978 when Brown's Kentucky fried
meddling drove him nuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him one time that we needed a backup guard,'' Auerbach
says. ``He called me up the next day and said he'd gotten one. I
asked him how much. He said $50,000. That's not too bad, I said.
`By the way,' he said, `I also gave them a first-round pick.' I
said, you did what?''
</P>
<P>
   Where would it end? He was afraid he would pick up the paper one
day, Auerbach said, and find out he'd been traded. So when the
Knicks offered him their presidency at a record salary, Auerbach
decided he'd take it _ until everybody from truck drivers to
shuttle pilots to former players to his wife Dot bade him
reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   He had enough money, Auerbach concluded. And even though he'd
been born on the other side of the Brooklyn Bridge, Auerbach
couldn't imagine himself working in New York _ and coming back to
Boston as a visitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about what it would be like to come back up to play
the Celtics, to watch the ballgame and look up at the flags,''
Auerbach said then. ``And I didn't know what my reaction would
be.''
</P>
<P>
   He had become as much a part of the city as Durgin-Park and the
Ritz and Filene's basement. Auerbach spends most of his time in
Washington now. He has survived heart surgery and 100,000 stogies
and enough plates of late-night Chinese food to top the Great Wall.
He still plays racquetball (``With Sam Jones's son. He's my
guru.'') and goes to his office and plays cards at his club and
keeps up with the game he helped shape.
</P>
<P>
   It is a different game now, with 29 franchises and overseas
offices from Paris to Taipei, with rookies making more in a season
than Cousy did in a career, with salary caps and strikes and
seasons that go to the middle of June and games that end up 85-79
and have viewers reaching for the clicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Stern has got the right idea,'' Auerbach muses. ``The
best way to save the game is to clean it up so you can see some of
the skills.''
</P>
<P>
   For 50 years, through the best and the worst, Arnold Auerbach
and the Celtics have been mentioned in the same sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red's been the glue that's been there for everything,'' says
Havlicek. ``When he's gone, people will look at the Celtics _ and
think they're like anyone else.''

A WHIFF OF COLLUSION OUT OF THE SOUTHWEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're trying to shoot down John McCain again. Only this time
the ack-ack is coming from the people on his own side, not the
North Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friendly fire'' was what they called it in the Vietnam War,
when your own guys inadvertently aimed at you. But when they were
deliberately trying to blast you, it was called ``fragging.'' The
outspoken conservative from Arizona is now being fragged by his own
home state governor and his hometown newspaper, The Arizona
Republic. And the suspicion grows that the triggerman is the
suddenly rattled campaign of Texas Governor George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   It's McCain who is surging in New Hampshire, largely because he
carries the fight against corrupt money in politics. Bush is the
biggest beneficiary of the lolly lavished on frontrunners. McCain
is emerging as this cycle's Message Man, the guy to vote for if you
want to send a message about the stinkhole that is national
politics today, thanks to the soft money avalanche and the soft
corruption it engenders.
</P>
<P>
   Bush Jr.'s hermetically sealed Bubble Boy campaign is conducted
on tame television and in friendly interviews, where Junior's
tender ears do not have to entertain tough questions or challenging
cross-examination. Despite a price-is-no-object campaign, his lead
is threatened by McCain's surge. The stately procession of Bush Jr.
to his coronation has been jarred by the undeniable attraction of
New Hampshire voters to a maverick Republican who has the
reputation of taking on the tough ones.
</P>
<P>
   That Bush Bandwagon has a slow leak in the right front tire.
Bush's lead is down to a dozen points, which may explain the
eruption of negative stories about McCain.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's handlers see the fine hand of the Bush string-pullers
behind a concerted effort to attack McCain's rear, in Arizona,
while depending on Bush's bloated TV advertising budget to contain
McCain at the front, in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   First, Arizona Governor Jane Hull comes out for Bush and knocks
McCain as a tantrum-prone tough guy. Then the governor's son is
appointed _ surprise, surprise! _ to be the front man for the Bush
campaign in Arizona. These are plum jobs, because if your guy wins,
you become the conduit for all the goodies, the presidential
appointments, leases, contracts, and favors that make the White
House so worth winning if you make a living out of politics or
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the Arizona Republic, with a knife-job editorial
raising doubts about McCain's supposedly fearsome temper. Jarrin'
John, complains the paper, can be ``volcanic . . . sarcastic and
condescending . . . '' The newspaper's chief executive appeared
Tuesday night on CNN's ``Crossfire,'' where co-host Bob Novak
skillfully elicited a number of facts the paper left out of its
editorial.
</P>
<P>
   A former political writer for the paper says McCain gets
hammered because he wouldn't ``kowtow'' or kiss the ring of the
paper's proprietor. Novak cited a vicious political cartoon
attacking McCain's wife, Cindy, who had an addiction to painkilling
drugs openly acknowledged by the McCain family for some time.
</P>
<P>
   The cartoon portrayed a vengeful Mrs. McCain shaking medicine
away from a cringing black child, said Novak, and it so angered the
senator, he refused to talk to the newspaper's reporters and
executives for a full year. I haven't seen the cartoon yet. Novak
said the Republic refused to give CNN permission to show it. If the
newspaper is afraid to allow it to be shown on national television,
draw your own conclusions as to fairness. The Republic threatens to
rival the reigning title holder in low blows, the Manchester Union
Leader.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper denies it is knowingly coordinating its attacks on
McCain with the governor's office or the Bush campaign, now more or
less one and the same, apparently, in Arizona. But there does seem
to be a whiff of collusion wafting out of the southwest toward New
Hampshire's mountainy airflow.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has muscle on the ground in NEw Hampshire. The supposedly
brawny political organization of Senator Judd Gregg, son of former
Governor Hugh Gregg, is pushing Bush. But Bushes have been a tough
sell there. George Sr. got creamed here in '80, barely survived the
'88 primary, got nicked badly in the '92 primary, and lost New
Hampshire to Clinton-Gore that year.
</P>
<P>
   We've seen big-time corporate lobbyists who shower money on
senators attack McCain. Then senators of his own party denouncing
him on the Senate floor for calling attention to the corruption he
alleges is indivisible from soft money flows. Bush, who has been
endorsed by so many governors and congressmen he can't name them
all, says you should judge a pol by the endorsements he gets. I say
you can tell more about a would-be president by looking at his
enemies. And the way John McCain is scaring his enemies makes
people like me think all the more of him. If New Hampshire wants to
send a message about soft money corruption Feb. 1, the messenger is
named McCain.

HERO WITH A HEART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost every story this week about Walter Payton will talk about
his 16,726 yards, his grit, his determination, his stamina, his
fitness, his off-season hill sprints that made many people who
tried to keep up with him vomit. He once said about his all-time
National Football League rushing record, ``I want to set the record
so high that the next person who tries for it, it's going to bust
his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when he announced in February that he had the rare liver
cancer that led to his death Monday at the sobering age of 45, a
frail Payton, half the size of when he ran defenses crazy for the
Chicago Bears, told the press, ``To some of you, I don't look
healthy. I still am. Most of you guys I can still take.''
</P>
<P>
   A funny and rarely exposed thing about Payton was that the one
person he couldn't take was himself. There was the Christmas Day 19
years ago when his wife Connie felt the contractions that signaled
the arrival of their first child. Walter had taken months of
breathing classes with Connie. But when Connie's contractions came,
Walter became like so many linemen he victimized, a deer frozen in
a flash of oncoming horror.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I told Walter I was starting my labor, he became very
nervous,'' Connie told me in a 1984 interview for Newsday, as
Payton closed in on Jim Brown's all-time rushing record. ``He got
to where he couldn't talk.
</P>
<P>
   Connie said Walter called a friend, Ron. For the longest, Ron
and Walter sat on opposite edges of a couch, speechless. Finally
Ron asked Walter if he had Connie's suitcase ready and the car
warmed up. Ron urged Walter to put his shoes on. Nothing worked.
</P>
<P>
   Ron became worn out and went home. Connie told Walter she wanted
to go to the hospital. Walter froze again. He called Ron. He called
his Aunt Hazel. Connie reminded Walter that no one except the
husband could go into the delivery area.
</P>
<P>
   Connie said Walter said, ``I don't care. I need them there. I
need these people.'' Payton was able to convince the hospital to
let Ron and Hazel into the delivery area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started the delivery, and I asked, `Where's Walter?' ''
Connie said. ``He sent Hazel in. She said Walter was watching TV.
She said that Walter said, `Tell her that I can't stand to watch! I
can't stand to see her in this pain! I can't bear to be in there!
It's too much pain for me to bear! I can't stand it!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Aunt Hazel helped Connie with her breathing. Walter collapsed
out in the hallway in a shattered pile of nerves. Connie delivered
a boy, Jarrett, by caesarean section. Walter missed the entire
thing. When Connie woke up after her own post-delivery nap, she
said, ``Walter was standing over me, holding Jarrett and crying.
All he could say was, `He's soooooo beautiful.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Walter missed his calling to be a Lamaze poster father,
but Connie laughed the entire time she told that story. She was
happy to be able to show a human side of Walter. She said that in
their early years together, she fretted about how Walter was a
stoic warrior to an extreme. When Walter's father died in 1978,
Walter barely talked about his feelings until about six years later
when Walter came into the house shaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said one of the boys he knew in the neighborhood had been
killed on his bicycle,'' Connie said of Walter. ``Walter had
stressed to the boy before that he should wear his helmet. Walter
stood there and said, `This is terrible. I know what his parents
are going through. I went through it myself with my father.' It was
the first time I heard him express in words how much pain it was to
lose his father.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton's quiet nature probably helped him for most of his
career, performing brilliantly but usually for terrible teams.
There would be cracks in his armor, tears after terrible defeats
and clear disappointment about not being asked to score a touchdown
in his only Super Bowl. But more important, his quiet reflected a
confidence that needed no exterior flash. He saved his laughter and
pranks for teammates and neighbors. Late in his career he stopped
spiking the ball after touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Words are not what I use to express myself,'' Payton said. ``
. . . I think a much more important human trait is to be able to
cry, to laugh, to reach out with your emotions. There's a lot of
macho in this world. Just feeling out your emotion is a trait that
a lot of people seem to delete from their character.''
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen years after words failed Payton on that frantic
Christmas, Jarrett Payton, the baby who was ``soooooo beautiful,''
stood beautifully before the press to thank everyone for their
support during his father's decline. ``You adopted my dad and made
him yours,'' Jarrett said.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Payton was adopted not just because he is in the Hall of
Fame. In him, fans found something real, something often found
wanting today. Payton said, ``I don't perceive myself as being
better than anyone. I shovel my driveway. I go to the grocery
store. I pump my own gas. Some athletes don't do that.'' For some
of today's athletes to be this real would be too much. It would
bust their hearts.

FRANK MCCOURT'S WILD IRISH RIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best book I've never read is ``Angela's Ashes,'' the wildly
successful memoir by Frank McCourt. The New York City
schoolteacher's account of his poverty-blighted upbringing in
Limerick, Ireland, won the 1997 Pulitzer Prize for biography and
has sold well over 1 million copies. ``Ashes'' and McCourt's
recently published sequel, `` 'Tis,'' have been singled out for
extraordinary praise in every English-speaking country in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Except for one. Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   From the Emerald Isle, a friend writes: ``Frank McCourt is in
town to promote his new book, and he is being bushwhacked by a
number of his Limerick contemporaries who claim that most of
`Angela's Ashes' is fiction (especially the portrait of his mother,
who was regarded as something of a saint in her neighbourhood) and
that people he claimed he renamed in the book are actual people,
etc. etc. His new book is called ` 'Tis,' and a local radio station
talk show guy has written a rejoinder called ` 'Tis a Load of
Bollocks.'. . .''
</P>
<P>
   When ``Ashes'' first appeared in Ireland, Irish Times writer
Kevin Myers hurried to the keyboard to produce the satirical
``Cyril's Cinders,'' excerpted here:
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I remember about my childhood? The same, I guess, as
any Irish adult remembers about that time in their lives.
Alcoholism, of course. My mother was an alcoholic, and I know now
why she was an alcoholic _ why, all Irish mothers are alcoholics.
It is to hide the pain of Irishness, the pain of life, the pain of
existence on an island where every mother is an Irish mother, every
mother is an alcoholic, and every mother has a child as miserable
as I was. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I remember about my childhood? I remember my father's
cruelty. He was cruel because he was married to an alcoholic, who
was alcoholic because she was married to him. . . . And at school _
well, when I say school, I mean an upturned rusty bucket, because
that was school in those days _ the Christian Brothers would wait
for us to get through the Specials' ambush, and then when the
surviviors staggered in, they would take down our trousers and beat
us with iron rods until it was time to go home again. That was our
education, pretty much.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached in Dublin, Myers still marvels at McCourt's popularity.
``Something happens when the Irish get to America, some part of
their brain is removed,'' he said. ``They invent an Ireland in
which all the complexities of identity seem to vanish. The minute
they cross Ellis Island, a kind of zombiedom takes over _ they
become the living dead.''
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, ``Ashes'' was very well received in Ireland, where
it still sells strongly and even landed McCourt an honorary degree
and writer-in-residence fellowship at the University of Limerick.
But Myers's was not the only discordant voice. A Limerick
journalist named Gerard Hannan published a book called ``Ashes,''
which offered ``real memoirs'' of McCourt's contemporaries. ``
`Angela's Ashes' creates an illusion,'' Hannan said in 1997. ``If
you lived on the lanes of Limerick you were living a miserable
life. . . . I want to shatter that illusion, and I make no
apologies for that.''
</P>
<P>
   McCourt's sequel, `` 'Tis'' received an especially rugged
reception in the country of his birth. Oxford professor Terry
Eagleton, who praised the ``first-rate fiction'' of ``Angela's
Ashes,'' savaged its successor in the Irish Times: ``The book is
written in the artless, lurching sentences favored by US creative
writing classes, with its sub-Hemingwayesque trick of stringing a
limitless number of sub-clauses together by recurrent `ands.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet, Hannan ambushed McCourt on a popular talk show and
loudly denounced him as ``a congenital liar'' on national
television. McCourt's wife rose from the audience to defend her
husband. ``It got quite ugly,'' reports one spectator. Small-scale
parodies called `` 'Tisn't'' and `` 'Tis My Arse'' have found their
way to bookstalls.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, McCourt has compared ``the little men'' berating
his work to the critics of James Joyce and John Millington Synge,
saying: ``It's keeping them out of the pubs.'' A spokesman for
McCourt said he wouldn't comment on his Irish critics now because
``he didn't feel there was a newsworthy amount of negative
reception.'' She then cited positive coverage of `` 'Tis'' in the
Sunday Times and Daily Telegraph _ both of which are published in
Britain.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HARBORSIDE, Maine _ The road is not well traveled. Nor is there
commerce _ not even a little country store with a gas pump. There's
hardly anything on the way to Cape Rosier but weathered cottages,
pine trees, and a magnificent, rugged coastline. Penobscot Bay
comes into view, then disappears as the road twists. The 40-acre
Four Season Farm is unmarked, partly hidden behind a stockade fence
that was built six years ago for privacy when Barbara Damrosch and
Eliot Coleman became the hosts of the Learning Channel's
``Gardening Naturally'' series.
</P>
<P>
   Damrosch opens a handwrought iron gate and leads the way into a
serene world. Big perennial flower gardens flank the front door.
Beyond are vegetables _ including Brussels sprouts and winter beets
_ harvested at once in the fall, so the effect all summer is
ornamental. She calls the landscaping ``English parterre, galumphy
formal.''
</P>
<P>
   Next to the garden is a grass volleyball court, surrounded by
trees and shrubs. From the court you can see the house, where an
attached greenhouse protects a fig tree so tall and full it's about
to burst through the plastic dome. Behind, in a clearing, a sauna
sits next to a pond. Then a path leads to another clearing, where
rows and rows of lettuces and vegetables and several 100-foot
mobile greenhouses stand braced for a Maine winter.
</P>
<P>
   Four Season's commercial ``season'' began last month and will
continue through the cold, wind, and snow, through temperatures
hovering around zero, until spring, when the gardeners rest.
Coleman spent years perfecting a method of growing cold-hardy
vegetables in unheated greenhouses in New England's severest
climate. Damrosch, who had been gardening for decades and is an
accomplished landscape designer, joined him on this land nine years
ago. ``I never had land. It was just so wonderful that I fell in
love with this farmer,'' she says. ``I married up.''
</P>
<P>
   She is only half joking. ``Up'' turned out to be wonderful real
estate, land that had once belonged to ``Living the Good Life''
back-to-the-earth gurus Helen and Scott Nearing, who sold off some
acreage to Coleman, a protege. ``Up'' also turned out to be an
inventive system of organic farming that supplies local restaurants
and co-ops with a refreshing mesclun salad mix, golf-ball-size
turnips that are barely sharp, carrots that define sweetness, and
at least a dozen other vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Damrosch, 57, and Coleman, 60, are partners in this venture.
``It's his brainchild,'' says Damrosch, author of ``The Garden
Primer,'' ``Theme Gardens,'' and Workman's page-a-day gardening
calendar. ``We share the work on harvest days, delivery days, and
all the day-to-day farm work. I do the bookkeeping and some of the
marketing. I'm the sounding board, and I do have ideas.'' She
weighs their chores as ``60-40,'' Coleman doing more on the farm
while she's writing.
</P>
<P>
   The two have the same philosophies. One is that food grown on
the farm should appear on tables only within a 25-mile radius. In
this case, it's the eight neighboring restaurants and stores.
``Every 25-mile circle should have its own growers,'' says Coleman,
author of ``The New Organic Grower'' and ``Four Season Harvest''
(both published by Chelsea Green). He has also written a detailed
manual on the greenhouse system for the commercial grower.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell people about this,'' says Damrosch, walking through
the fields on a chilly fall day, ``and they have to see it to
believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lettuces and greens pop out of the earth in varying shades of
green and red, looking like rows of needlepoint.
</P>
<P>
   If it seems implausible that these vegetables will grow all
winter, Damrosch explains it with a geography lesson. Four Season
Farm is on the 44th parallel, which runs east from Oregon across
coastal Maine, then over the Atlantic to the south of France and
Tuscany.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Damrosch and Coleman took a 44th-parallel trip to
Europe to see what other farmers did in winter. ``We don't have the
Gulf Stream and climate that they do,'' says Damrosch, ``but the
length of their winter day is the same as ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Some farmers were growing inside double-tunnel greenhouses (a
small, low house within a house), and others were growing under row
tunnels. Coleman puts a single layer of plastic and ground cover
between the plants and the light. ``The double layer cuts down on
light,'' Damrosch explains.
</P>
<P>
   At Four Season, there are six mobile greenhouses built on big
hoop frames. They sit on pipe rails and can be moved with a tractor
after the ground has been harvested. The farmers simply plant the
next field and slip the greenhouse over it.
</P>
<P>
   Once planted, the seeds are protected by big sheets of floating
white row cover. They grow slowly, says Damrosch. ``Crops take
weeks, rather than days.'' Only one greenhouse is heated (using
artificial heat would defeat the purpose of energy efficiency), and
that house is wider than the others, with a cement floor at one
end, so it isn't mobile. This is where Damrosch and Coleman do
their packing. Lettuce is rinsed and layered in Maine cedar crates
burnished with the label ``seasonal salads'' at one end. Damrosch
lines the crates with cellophane, the sort used for flower
bouquets, and fills the boxes with 3 1/2 pounds of greens (the
wholesale cost is $6.50 per pound). Carrots, turnips, leeks, and
radishes are all packed separately with cellophane, so you can see
right into the top of the crate.
</P>
<P>
   The system is streamlined and efficient now, but it took years
to arrive at this point, and Damrosch says it's still evolving.
Coleman had experimented for 10 years while he was farm manager of
the Mountain School in Vershire, Vt., a semester-long rural-living
experience for juniors in high school. He wanted to find a way to
extend the season for the students.
</P>
<P>
   Once you step inside a greenhouse, you have to remove your coat.
``It can be 15 below, and you come inside and immediately take off
your parka,'' says Damrosch. Under the ground cover, the
temperature is the same as Georgia's in winter.
</P>
<P>
   The main crop at Four Season is the mesclun salad mix of as many
as 10 different mild greens, including curly endive, bull's blood
beet leaves, and red ace beet leaves, which add a warm yellow and
some deep burgundy colors to the mix. ``I don't like bitter,'' says
Damrosch. ``I like sharp.'' They harvest about 50 pounds of mesclun
twice a week, 100 pounds of carrots, 50 pounds of turnips, 25
pounds of spinach, plus radishes, broccoli rabe, chicory, collards,
escarole, kale, kohlrabi, leeks, mustard greens, pak-choi (a
relative of bok choy), and lots of new potatoes in the spring. They
gross $50,000 a year. ``Part of the economy is that we don't hire
people,'' she says. ``We try to keep the farm small enough so we
can do it ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   When Damrosch arrives in the fields early in the morning, the
greens are frozen. ``They can withstand frost,'' she says, as long
as the roots haven't frozen. ``Some crops actually like frost,''
she says, ``like arugula, which isn't hot and biting.'' The greens
come back to life as soon as the sun has warmed the greenhouses
above freezing.
</P>
<P>
   On harvest days _ Mondays and Thursdays _ Damrosch brings a
picnic to the fields so they can eat in 10 minutes. ``We're racing
with the climate,'' she says. Even after the sun has set, the two
are still packing in the heated greenhouse, listening to National
Public Radio ``until we get tired of it,'' Coleman says.
</P>
<P>
   She adds: ``Then we switch to oldies.''

HELMS ENMITY AN INSPIRATION TO WOMEN OFFICE-SEEKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SAUSALITO, Calif. &UR;  &LR; -- Jesse Helms, beloved son of the late
Confederacy, is ignoring a lesson that Robert E. Lee and others
learned on the battlefield: When enemy forces multiply, don't taunt
'em; skedaddle.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina senator enrages and delights the Women's
Campaign Fund because his actions may populate Congress with more
politically active, uppity women, whom Helms regards with the
wariness of Tarheel ancestors looking at the Union army. Because
Carol Moseley-Braun did not share his devotion to the Confederate
flag, the 78-year-old chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee
promised that she would wait a long time before taking up residence
in a US embassy.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton had appointed the defeated Democratic senator
from Illinois as ambassador to New Zealand. No way, said Jesse,
irked that the nominee had once objected to subsidizing a private
group's display of the Stars and Bars. Helms was still chortling
about stiffing his former foe when women from the US House showed
up in his hearing room to seek support for a treaty about women.
</P>
<P>
   The visit may have been a stunt, but what did Jesse do? The son
of the onetime Monroe, N.C., police chief first told them to act
like ladies, then called the cops.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's gift for irking women was on the unspoken agenda
at a fund-raiser by the Women's Campaign Fund in this seaside
village. The group is bipartisan but supports only candidates who
favor abortion rights. Of 23 members of Congress it helped elect in
1998, five are Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women candidates are inspired by women in both parties,''
Erica Henri, the Campaign Fund's political director, says. ``It's
not just Hillary Clinton. Governor Christie Whitman of New Jersey
and Elizabeth Dole's presidential campaign, too. We've had 120
requests for help, including many in the South.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven congressional candidates spotlighted in Sausalito, all
Democrats, share two traits _ experience and tenacity. Elaine
Bloom, a member of the Florida Legislature, is running against
Representative Clay Shaw of Fort Lauderdale, in Congress since
1980. Shaw was unopposed in 1998, but he won't be this time. Also
from Florida, Jean Elliott-Brown is using the Internet to raise
money and trouble against Republican Representative Mark Foley of
Palm Beach, also unopposed last time.
</P>
<P>
   Heidi Behrens Benedict, a Seattle businesswoman, decided to run
against Representative Jennifer Dunn a month before the filing
deadline in 1998. She won 40 percent, and a rematch is set for
2000. In the New Jersey district of Representative Bob Franks,
Maryanne Connelly, the mayor of Fanwood, won 44 percent in 1998.
She's trying again.
</P>
<P>
   Two Californians, Susan Davis and Hilda Solis, serve in the
California state Senate. Davis is tackling Representative Brian
Bilbray of San Diego, reelected in 1998 with 49 percent of the
vote. Another Californian, Janice Nelson, a physician, faces tough
odds against Representative David Dreier, chairman of the House
Rules Committee. But she got 39 percent in 1998 while being
outspent 6-to-1. She's still practicing medicine and still running
against Dreier. That's tenacity.
</P>
<P>
   As yachts floated by, the candidates empathized with a friendly
crowd. Northern California is hospitable to female politicians like
Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein. Six of the 10 House
members from the San Francisco Bay Area are women, several of whom
offended Helms's sense of senatorial decorum.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every woman in politics is motivated by the frequent
discovery that guys just don't get it. Helms is the poster child of
this phenomenon. But since he was elected in 1972, the number of
women in Congress has grown steadily, and more may arrive next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Besides helping women raise funds, the Women's Campaign Fund
also offers a questionnaire about emotions: ``Are you able to
handle criticism well? Are you a team player? Are you well
organized? Do you delegate tasks well? Are you comfortable speaking
in public?''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe somebody should send a copy to Jesse Helms.

   YOURE-FIRED _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Let's talk about job
security. What makes you so sure you have any? True, the economy's
booming, so it's not like there's a crowd panting over that cubicle
of yours. And yes, the company does have a good deal invested in
hiring, training and nurturing you _ not to mention what it laid
out to undeviate your septum. Besides, with all the
employment-protection laws and court cases, a boss can't just toss
people out the door the way a boss could toss before. You have the
right to a warning, a notice, a hearing, an appeal. Don't you?
You'd better click your way out of that online casino game and read
on. You are right about this much: It's hard to get fired these
days. Maybe harder than ever. But fear not _ we have five quick and
easy ways to get fired in this PC day and age. (Kalajian, Palm

   FAT-SURGERY _ ROYAL PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Ron Bovino once couldn't
stop eating. Four Big Macs. A large pizza. A plate of
bologna-cheese sandwiches. Yet he never felt full. Now people make
fun of him for ordering from the children's menu. The 38-year-old
Royal Palm Beach man is 260 pounds lighter because he had his
stomach stapled three years ago and has since worked religiously to
shed the fat. But his labors have left him with 30 pounds of skin
hanging around his waist like a ballerina's tutu _ an unseemly
sight he hides under his pants. Wednesday, surgeons will remove
Bovino's excess skin at JFK Medical Center in Atlantis. Bovino went
public with his story to give credit to his doctors and the
hospital, who have agreed not to bill him for the operation.

   FOOD-ANCIENT _ At the Sterling Museum at Yale U. are three
cuneiform tablets from ancient Mesopotamia that date to 1850 BC,
among the oldest recorded documents of humankind. When linguists
first tried to translate them, they figured they were from an
apothecary since they contained lists of ingredients followed by
instructions for combination. But a noted French assyriologist (a
linguist who studies Sumerian and Akkadian) and gourmet named Jean
Bottero discovered they were culinary texts. They are in fact the
world's first cookbooks and recipes sound surprisingly
contemporary. Quail braised with leeks, cumin and ginger.
Flatbread. Lamb stew. Barley ale. There's even a chicken pot pie.
I'll interview Bottero and the Yale curator, Ulla Kasten, to
elucidate the texts and the cookery lore and recipes from the
Fertile Crescent. I'll also reprint recipes developed by
assyriologists and updated for modern palates. No coagulated blood
dumplings or fermented ewe's milk, thank you very much. Sidebars

S.F. VOTERS APPROVE TAX HIKES FOR PARAMEDICS, LIBRARIES AND PARKS

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Voters around the San Francisco area don't seem
to mind chipping in extra money to help pay for local services, as
they passed seven of 10 tax measures on the ballot Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   San Mateo residents will be getting a bigger library thanks to
the approval of a $35 million bond.
</P>
<P>
   More than 71 percent of the voters approved Measure F, which
will pay for major renovation and expansion of the main branch.
</P>
<P>
   The measure needed at least two-thirds approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``The library is overcrowded and out of date,'' said Brad Lyau,
Yes on Measure F campaign field director. ``With the new money, we
will be expanding the library's open stack space by at least 50
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   A fraction of the money also will be used to renovate the city's
two branch libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners will have to pay $30 per year for each $100,000 of
assessed value of their house for the next 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   In San Carlos, residents will start paying an annual parcel tax
of $6 for the next 10 years. Measure G gained just over 76 percent
approval Tuesday, easily surpassing the required two-thirds vote.
</P>
<P>
   City officials estimate they will be able to raise more than $1
million in seven years, which will be used for the long-term
capital improvement of parks and recreational facilities.
</P>
<P>
   San Bruno voters also approved a pair of tax measures.
</P>
<P>
   Measure I _ an increase business license taxes _ is expected to
raise an additional $170,000 annually while Measure J _ an 8
percent airport parking tax _ generates about $550,000 a year for
the city's general fund.
</P>
<P>
   In Atherton, voters rejected a measure that would have
authorized the City Council to levy special property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Measure H received just over 50 percent of the vote, failing to
gain the required two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   In San Rafael, a special tax to help pay for the city's
paramedic services passed with 84 percent of the voters approving
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Measure P will increase current taxes on homes for paramedic
services from $40 to $53 a year. Taxes on commercial property also
will increase from 5 cents per square foot to 7 cents per square
foot. Both increases will be phased in over three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm overwhelmed how the citizens responded to the campaign,''
said San Rafael Fire Chief Bob Marcucci.
</P>
<P>
   Marcucci estimates the new tax will give a $325,000 boost to the
department's $2.8 million annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   A $6.83 million bond measure in Fairfax barely cleared the
required two-thirds vote Tuesday with 68 percent of the votes. It
will replace the town's storm drains and resurface some of the
severely deteriorated streets.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Corte Madera, voters rejected a special tax that would
have paid for the renovation of the town's recreation center.
</P>
<P>
   In the East Bay, Union City voters narrowly approved Measure E,
increasing the city's hotel room tax rate from 6.5 percent to 8.5
percent. Sixty-seven percent of the voters approved the measure.
</P>
<P>
   City officials estimate the tax will raise an additional
$112,000 per year, which will be used as part of a general fund.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Altos, voters rejected a proposed increase in the
utility-user tax, from 3.5 percent to 6.25 percent. The measure
needed a majority vote, but got just over 48 percent support.

   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ With a badge and a gun and a loyal
following, Major Jan Zeman is back on duty 10 years after the end
of communist rule, in pursuit of lawbreakers and subversives who
threaten the social order.
</P>
<P>
   The fictional Major Zeman was the former Czechoslovakia's
favorite television police detective during communist times. But a
decision by Czech Television to re-broadcast the 1970s serial has
raised a fierce debate in the Czech Republic over whether the show
is propaganda or entertainment or history.
</P>
<P>
   Every Thursday night at 8 since its debut in mid-September,
Czechs in vast numbers have been tuning in for the next installment
of ``The 30 Cases of Major Zeman.'' The heroic, hard-nosed cop
always gets his man and every episode sends a subtle if
unmistakable message: the Communist regime, as embodied by Zeman,
is the common comrade's only friend.
</P>
<P>
   And that has former political prisoners, human rights advocates
and reform politicians upset. They're demanding that the show be
taken off the air, and accusing Czech TV of offering up
brainwashing propaganda in the guise of a historical TV
retrospective. It comes at a sensitive time when the present-day
Communist Party is enjoying a surge in support amid the country's
economic malaise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes those who worked for freedom look like criminals,
which of course was its original intent,'' complains Frantisek
Sedivy, 72, who served 12 years in prison in the 1950s and '60s for
spreading democratic ideology among fellow university students.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over whether there is a place for Major Zeman in
the post-communist era goes to the very heart of how this Central
European country, now a member of the NATO alliance, is struggling
to define its fledgling democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The television producers who decided to rebroadcast the serial _
with accompanying documentaries exploring how the show was a tool
of the regime _ say that their intent was to force this nation of
10 million to begin to come to terms with its past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has stirred up the very questions we've been trying to
avoid,'' agrees Jiri Pehe, a Czech scholar who runs New York
University's campus in Prague.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 17 marks the 10th anniversary of the ``Velvet Revolution,''
which overthrew communism in what was then Czechoslovakia. (In
1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia mutually agreed to become
separate nations).
</P>
<P>
   However, the transition to a free-market economy has clearly
stalled in the Czech Republic, until a few years ago among the most
prosperous and fast-changing of the former Communist states.
Economic reforms were postponed in the mid-1990s, and the weak
Social Democratic government installed in 1997 elections has been
hamstrung by its lack of a majority in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in the past decade, few officials of the former era
have faced trial for crimes and murders committed during the harsh,
41-year communist reign. Only five officials from the period have
been convicted in the past 10 years in the Czech Republic, while as
many as 300,000 people were jailed as political prisoners or
committed to mental institutions during communist times.
</P>
<P>
   And unrepentant Czech torturers and secret police officials have
gone so far as to form an Association for the Protection of those
Prosecuted by the Capitalistic Regime within the last few years. It
has even filed discrimination complaints with international human
rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   The public dialogue about the past has been clouded because of a
collective guilt over the crimes committed and what, if anything,
should have been done to change things sooner, according to Pehe.
``People will always tell you how the others were involved, but not
what they themselves were doing back then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Czech TV officials regard the controversy over the show as
healthy, if not easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear to us that we have poked a wasp's nest. And we've
asked ourselves why people are so emotional about this,'' said Iva
Prochakova, a Czech TV producer who oversees the Zeman series.
``But the process of democracy-building requires us to look back at
our own past.''
</P>
<P>
   However, critics regard the airing of the series as highly
insensitive to the still-raw wounds of the hundreds of thousands
who suffered under communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   The Czech Confederation of Political Prisoners has filed a
criminal complaint in court charging that the series promotes
hatred and the ``repression of citizens' rights and freedoms.'' The
country's broadcast regulators have warned of possible fines for
spreading ``totalitarian ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Bret, a deputy director of the Czech police's Bureau for
the Documentation and Investigation of Communist Crimes, compares
the Zeman series to the powerful and artful propaganda of Nazi
Germany. It glorifies an agent of the Communist regime which
systematically persecuted innocent people, he contends, and it
should not be on TV because the country's young democracy cannot
handle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 10 years we're assuming that society is more critical
and more sensitive to the objective truth about their history and
about their past. This is not the case,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The scripts, based on real-life events, were artful distortions
that portrayed the communist regime as generally benevolent and
just. The villains jousting with Zeman were often priests,
intellectuals, artists, students and Western spies. During
production, government handlers from the interior ministry oversaw
the scripts and shooting.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one episode deals with the murder of several
Communist Party officials in a conspiracy said to involve Western
spies and priests. Evidence uncovered since the fall of communism,
and included in an accompanying Zeman documentary, reveals that the
assassinations were an inside job carried out as part of a power
struggle within the communist ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with the country's economy faltering and the reform
government tainted by allegations of corruption, the opposition
Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia enjoys the support of 20
percent of the population, according to recent polls. It marks a
high point in public support for the communists since the regime
fell in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials vow that if they came to power they would shift
the Czech Republic from its current capitalist course back to
socialism and seek to annul the country's membership in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, granted earlier this year along
Hungary and Poland.
</P>
<P>
   The airing of Zeman could hasten their return, by making
communism seem cool, say critics of the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The population today could be influenced by this series. Those
who see the problems of today's society may think it was a better
time when they view this propaganda,'' said Jaroslav Runt, 77, a
deputy chairman of the former political prisoners confederation.
</P>
<P>
   The country's best-known former political prisoner, President
Vaclav Havel, who spent almost five years in communist jails,
dismissed the series as ``not the first nor the last idiocy aired
by Czech Television.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is as melodramatic and dated as an episode of Mannix.
Many viewers, it seems, are drawn to the show out of nostalgia for
their youth, not the politics of the time. Tuning in each week to
see Zeman's latest exploits is merely a walk down memory lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching Zeman is kind of like putting on an old pair of boots
you've dug out of the closet,'' said Vera Kamenicka, 58, of Prague.
``They are kind of comfortable, but out of fashion.''

 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ On a recent afternoon, Lothar Weinberg celebrated with
a sip of champagne the conclusion of his philosophical journey from
Karl Marx to Dale Carnegie.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg, 52, has a salesman's eye contact, smile and handshake
_ the markings of a man destined to win friends and influence
people.
</P>
<P>
   Gathered with a few friends over hors d'oeuvres and drinks in a
sparsely furnished suburban office, Weinberg toasted the beginning
of a new and perhaps more perilous adventure _ running a business
in a free market economy.
</P>
<P>
   And he's going at it full-bore, throwing himself into
capitalism's wildest and woolliest milieu: private consulting. He
and his partner hope their new business, Know How Inc., will make
them rich, an objective as distant as Mars just a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   When the Berlin Wall was famously breached 10 years ago Tuesday,
Weinberg was fastened securely in East Germany's Communist
structure. He was an electrical engineer facing a future with
little risk or reward.
</P>
<P>
   At the dawn of the millennium, life for Weinberg _ as well as
his former East German countrymen _ is now full of both.
</P>
<P>
   For Weinberg, who felt the fires of ambition as a young man, the
changes that came in that momentous autumn of 1989 couldn't have
come soon enough. He regrets the years stifled in the old system.
``For me, the wall came down too late,'' he said during a break
from entertaining well-wishers. ``But my children. They will know
well what it means to have freedom and democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away, Burkhard Rauschart sat on a wooden bench in an
open plaza sharing beer and cynicism with friends. Rauschart's eyes
were bloodshot and full of suspicion. He clinched an unlit
cigarette between his fingers as he listened to a stranger's
questions about life after The Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wall,'' he said ``I wish they would build it back _ and 10
meters higher.''
</P>
<P>
   The park bench chorus confirmed this sentiment with grumbling
obscenities. It's been a hard 10 years. Within a few months of the
dawn of freedom, he got a divorce and lost his job as a train
security inspector.
</P>
<P>
   For people like Rauschart, the benefits of freedom seem
abstract, while the tribulations of capitalism are real.
``Freedom?'' he said with a caustic laugh. ``Freedom. Who can
afford it?''
</P>
<P>
   In Berlin, people often say that tearing down the
brick-and-mortar Berlin Wall was easy compared to removing the
barriers that remain in the minds of Ossies and Wessies _
Easterners and Westerners.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Ostalgia'' _ a sense of longing for the good old days _
expressed by Rauschart is not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey indicated that some 13 percent of the population
would like to see the East and West divided again. The numbers were
nearly the same for both easterners and westerners surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 10 percent believed that Germans are now ``one
people,'' the poll said. Most _ 57 percent _ said another decade
would be needed to unite Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The malaise is deeper among Ossies _ people from the former East
Germany. Easterners say that they are paid less than their Wessi
counterparts and are treated as second-class citizens. ``They think
we're lazy and stupid,'' said Manfred Schneider, a 70-year-old
former East German army officer who now earns about $4 an hour as a
security guard.
</P>
<P>
   Many Ossies express a gnawing anxiety over losing the
cradle-to-grave security that they enjoyed in the past even if they
lacked privacy and personal freedom. In a September survey, only 38
percent of east Germans said they were satisfied with democracy
compared to 60 percent in the west.
</P>
<P>
   Only 32 percent in the east favored continuing the free-market
economy. Most surprisingly, 51 percent of the Ossies said they were
happier in the communist German Democratic Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Rauschart, for one, said his life is far more difficult now. He
lives on $600 a month in government welfare. After paying the rent
on a subsidized one-bedroom apartment in the poor Hohenschoenhausen
district, Rauschart is left with about $250 for groceries and other
basics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough,'' he says bitterly. ``Lamb cutlets cost four
times more than they did before.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments have found political resonance. The Communists _
reborn as the Party of Democratic Socialism, or PDS _ are now
Germany's No. 2 political party behind Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder's Social Democrats. And in a potentially more worrisome
trend, the far-right German's Peoples Union won seats in two
eastern state parliaments.
</P>
<P>
   The PDS positions itself as a hip alternative to the capitalists
of the West that stresses social justice issues and a respect for
the old ways of the East. The party is by far the biggest in
eastern Germany with nearly 100,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Even more moderate East Germans express feelings of uneasiness
about unification, particularly the way their former identities
seem to have been lost in the transition.
</P>
<P>
   Many say they feel like a conquered colony. ``I wouldn't
describe it as a unification as much as I would call it a
swallowing,'' said Christoph Links, a former East German journalist
who is running a successful publishing house in East Berlin. ``We
had all the systems and structures of West Germany imposed on us
with all the problems that were already there. It's as if our whole
biographies are not accepted _ we spent our lives in a wrong system
so our lives before unification don't mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   This nostalgia is puzzling to many, including former East German
politburo member Guenter Schabowski, the former communist official
who announced the end of travel restrictions on Nov. 8, 1989. In
his view, this decision brought an end to the wall's practical
relevance. ``At that moment, the wall became only a metaphor,''
Schabowski said during a discussion over plates of fancy Italian
food not far from the former location of Checkpoint Charlie, the
gate from East Berlin to the city's American Sector.
</P>
<P>
   Schabowski, now 70, is awaiting sentencing for his role in the
shooting deaths of people trying to flee the East over the wall. He
denies that he had a direct part in the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   He has little patience for all this ``Ostalgia.'' ``They are
concerned about the loss of the socialist institutions and the high
rates of unemployment, and I don't reproach them for that,'' he
said. ``But it was an illusion. You see, the failure of the GDR was
this: These positive traits weren't positive because we had no way
to pay for them.''
</P>
<P>
   And people are selective about what they remember, he said.
``They say things were cheaper then, but they seem to forget that
they couldn't find anything to buy,'' he said. ``What has happened
in 10 years is enormous. If you don't see that, then you have
something else in your head.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ossies aren't alone in their concerns. In the West, there
are fears that the once economic powerhouse has squandered its
wealth trying to prop up the East, which was an economic ruin in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   The German government has spent more than $600 billion in the
former East Germany, which to the annoyance of many in the West is
benefiting tremendously from the new infrastructure. It is
generally accepted that the phone system in the East is now much
more advanced than the older one in the West.
</P>
<P>
   West Germans often grumble about paying the 7.5 percent levy
known as a ``Solidarity Tax'' on their incomes to help the East.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Ossies feel the Wessies haven't been given any
credit for what they contribute. ``I wouldn't say. 'We pay the
solidarity tax, too,''' said Tom Sello, a former opposition leader.
</P>
<P>
   Sello expressed a common sentiment . . . ``I'm personally better
off now, but that doesn't mean I'm happy about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the complaining, Berlin is for most people today a
better place to live.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Brauer, a Wessie who owns a yachting school with an Ossie
partner, said only a fool would want to return Berlin to being
isolated island in East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no going back, and there shouldn't be, `` Brauer
said. ``The two parts of the city have to grow together and in time
become just one city.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   It is hard to trace the wall on the landscape these days. The
city center, which was left to atrophy during the Cold War, is now
booming, in part because of the return earlier this year of the
national government for the first time since Hitler was in power.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to push the city into the future sometimes has paid
little attention to its past. Construction workers last month
uncovered part of the bunker where Hitler spent his last hours
before committing suicide. City officials wasted no time in
deciding to continue with plans to build a new road over the
bunker, paving it back to its inglorious past.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1989, Michael Roesler's city map showed West Berlin as an
undefined white blot. Today he and his wife Kristina live in an
apartment in the white blot.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the wall came down, they were forced to leave their
apartment in the east after the owner reclaimed the building and
began to remodel it. Their new apartment is spacious by European
standards and has a view of a nearby park.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening, the Roeslers looked through the pages of
the scrapbook they've made to recount their new lives. Their
greatest satisfaction seems to come from having been able to see
much of the world for themselves _ a nearly unheard of joy in the
old days.
</P>
<P>
   At first, they traveled with a keen sense of urgency _ as if the
wall would suddenly close again. They learned _ to their quiet
satisfaction _ that the West isn't quite up to their old fantasies.
``We've seen Vienna and it was fine, but it is no better than
Budapest,'' said Kristina. ``We see that not everything is perfect
in the West.''
</P>
<P>
   As their retirement years approach, they worry about their
financial security _ an unheard of burden in the old days.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, they have managed well in this strange new system. ``We're
really benefiting from these capitalistic means of making money,''
joked Michael Roesler, who has switched jobs twice sense
reunification.
</P>
<P>
   They wouldn't say that the old days were better, but they also
wouldn't argue that they had nothing to commend them either.
</P>
<P>
   But the Roeslers are optimistic about the future. They plan to
visit Toronto to see old friends _ once a bold dream that is now
just a pleasant expectation.
</P>
<P>
   There's no hurry because the wall is gone forever.

<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ With a badge and a gun and a loyal
following, Major Jan Zeman is back on duty 10 years after the end
of communist rule, in pursuit of lawbreakers and subversives who
threaten the social order.
</P>
<P>
   The fictional Major Zeman was the former Czechoslovakia's
favorite television police detective during communist times. But a
decision by Czech Television to re-broadcast the 1970s serial has
raised a fierce debate in the Czech Republic over whether the show
is propaganda or entertainment or history.
</P>
<P>
   Every Thursday night at 8 since its debut in mid-September,
Czechs in vast numbers have been tuning in for the next installment
of ``The 30 Cases of Major Zeman.'' The heroic, hard-nosed cop
always gets his man and every episode sends a subtle if
unmistakable message: the Communist regime, as embodied by Zeman,
is the common comrade's only friend.
</P>
<P>
   And that has former political prisoners, human rights advocates
and reform politicians upset. They're demanding that the show be
taken off the air, and accusing Czech TV of offering up
brainwashing propaganda in the guise of a historical TV
retrospective. It comes at a sensitive time when the present-day
Communist Party is enjoying a surge in support amid the country's
economic malaise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes those who worked for freedom look like criminals,
which of course was its original intent,'' complains Frantisek
Sedivy, 72, who served 12 years in prison in the 1950s and '60s for
spreading democratic ideology among fellow university students.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over whether there is a place for Major Zeman in
the post-communist era goes to the very heart of how this Central
European country, now a member of the NATO alliance, is struggling
to define its fledgling democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The television producers who decided to rebroadcast the serial _
with accompanying documentaries exploring how the show was a tool
of the regime _ say that their intent was to force this nation of
10 million to begin to come to terms with its past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has stirred up the very questions we've been trying to
avoid,'' agrees Jiri Pehe, a Czech scholar who runs New York
University's campus in Prague.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 17 marks the 10th anniversary of the ``Velvet Revolution,''
which overthrew communism in what was then Czechoslovakia. (In
1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia mutually agreed to become
separate nations).
</P>
<P>
   However, the transition to a free-market economy has clearly
stalled in the Czech Republic, until a few years ago among the most
prosperous and fast-changing of the former Communist states.
Economic reforms were postponed in the mid-1990s, and the weak
Social Democratic government installed in 1997 elections has been
hamstrung by its lack of a majority in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in the past decade, few officials of the former era
have faced trial for crimes and murders committed during the harsh,
41-year communist reign. Only five officials from the period have
been convicted in the past 10 years in the Czech Republic, while as
many as 300,000 people were jailed as political prisoners or
committed to mental institutions during communist times.
</P>
<P>
   And unrepentant Czech torturers and secret police officials have
gone so far as to form an Association for the Protection of those
Prosecuted by the Capitalistic Regime within the last few years. It
has even filed discrimination complaints with international human
rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   The public dialogue about the past has been clouded because of a
collective guilt over the crimes committed and what, if anything,
should have been done to change things sooner, according to Pehe.
``People will always tell you how the others were involved, but not
what they themselves were doing back then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Czech TV officials regard the controversy over the show as
healthy, if not easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear to us that we have poked a wasp's nest. And we've
asked ourselves why people are so emotional about this,'' said Iva
Prochakova, a Czech TV producer who oversees the Zeman series.
``But the process of democracy-building requires us to look back at
our own past.''
</P>
<P>
   However, critics regard the airing of the series as highly
insensitive to the still-raw wounds of the hundreds of thousands
who suffered under communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   The Czech Confederation of Political Prisoners has filed a
criminal complaint in court charging that the series promotes
hatred and the ``repression of citizens' rights and freedoms.'' The
country's broadcast regulators have warned of possible fines for
spreading ``totalitarian ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Bret, a deputy director of the Czech police's Bureau for
the Documentation and Investigation of Communist Crimes, compares
the Zeman series to the powerful and artful propaganda of Nazi
Germany. It glorifies an agent of the Communist regime which
systematically persecuted innocent people, he contends, and it
should not be on TV because the country's young democracy cannot
handle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 10 years we're assuming that society is more critical
and more sensitive to the objective truth about their history and
about their past. This is not the case,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The scripts, based on real-life events, were artful distortions
that portrayed the communist regime as generally benevolent and
just. The villains jousting with Zeman were often priests,
intellectuals, artists, students and Western spies. During
production, government handlers from the interior ministry oversaw
the scripts and shooting.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one episode deals with the murder of several
Communist Party officials in a conspiracy said to involve Western
spies and priests. Evidence uncovered since the fall of communism,
and included in an accompanying Zeman documentary, reveals that the
assassinations were an inside job carried out as part of a power
struggle within the communist ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with the country's economy faltering and the reform
government tainted by allegations of corruption, the opposition
Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia enjoys the support of 20
percent of the population, according to recent polls. It marks a
high point in public support for the communists since the regime
fell in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials vow that if they came to power they would shift
the Czech Republic from its current capitalist course back to
socialism and seek to annul the country's membership in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, granted earlier this year along
Hungary and Poland.
</P>
<P>
   The airing of Zeman could hasten their return, by making
communism seem cool, say critics of the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The population today could be influenced by this series. Those
who see the problems of today's society may think it was a better
time when they view this propaganda,'' said Jaroslav Runt, 77, a
deputy chairman of the former political prisoners confederation.
</P>
<P>
   The country's best-known former political prisoner, President
Vaclav Havel, who spent almost five years in communist jails,
dismissed the series as ``not the first nor the last idiocy aired
by Czech Television.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is as melodramatic and dated as an episode of Mannix.
Many viewers, it seems, are drawn to the show out of nostalgia for
their youth, not the politics of the time. Tuning in each week to
see Zeman's latest exploits is merely a walk down memory lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching Zeman is kind of like putting on an old pair of boots
you've dug out of the closet,'' said Vera Kamenicka, 58, of Prague.
``They are kind of comfortable, but out of fashion.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ On a recent afternoon, Lothar Weinberg celebrated with
a sip of champagne the conclusion of his philosophical journey from
Karl Marx to Dale Carnegie.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg, 52, has a salesman's eye contact, smile and handshake
_ the markings of a man destined to win friends and influence
people.
</P>
<P>
   Gathered with a few friends over hors d'oeuvres and drinks in a
sparsely furnished suburban office, Weinberg toasted the beginning
of a new and perhaps more perilous adventure _ running a business
in a free market economy.
</P>
<P>
   And he's going at it full-bore, throwing himself into
capitalism's wildest and woolliest milieu: private consulting. He
and his partner hope their new business, Know How Inc., will make
them rich, an objective as distant as Mars just a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   When the Berlin Wall was famously breached 10 years ago Tuesday,
Weinberg was fastened securely in East Germany's Communist
structure. He was an electrical engineer facing a future with
little risk or reward.
</P>
<P>
   At the dawn of the millennium, life for Weinberg _ as well as
his former East German countrymen _ is now full of both.
</P>
<P>
   For Weinberg, who felt the fires of ambition as a young man, the
changes that came in that momentous autumn of 1989 couldn't have
come soon enough. He regrets the years stifled in the old system.
``For me, the wall came down too late,'' he said during a break
from entertaining well-wishers. ``But my children. They will know
well what it means to have freedom and democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away, Burkhard Rauschart sat on a wooden bench in an
open plaza sharing beer and cynicism with friends. Rauschart's eyes
were bloodshot and full of suspicion. He clinched an unlit
cigarette between his fingers as he listened to a stranger's
questions about life after The Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wall,'' he said ``I wish they would build it back _ and 10
meters higher.''
</P>
<P>
   The park bench chorus confirmed this sentiment with grumbling
obscenities. It's been a hard 10 years. Within a few months of the
dawn of freedom, he got a divorce and lost his job as a train
security inspector.
</P>
<P>
   For people like Rauschart, the benefits of freedom seem
abstract, while the tribulations of capitalism are real.
``Freedom?'' he said with a caustic laugh. ``Freedom. Who can
afford it?''
</P>
<P>
   In Berlin, people often say that tearing down the
brick-and-mortar Berlin Wall was easy compared to removing the
barriers that remain in the minds of Ossies and Wessies _
Easterners and Westerners.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Ostalgia'' _ a sense of longing for the good old days _
expressed by Rauschart is not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey indicated that some 13 percent of the population
would like to see the East and West divided again. The numbers were
nearly the same for both easterners and westerners surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 10 percent believed that Germans are now ``one
people,'' the poll said. Most _ 57 percent _ said another decade
would be needed to unite Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The malaise is deeper among Ossies _ people from the former East
Germany. Easterners say that they are paid less than their Wessi
counterparts and are treated as second-class citizens. ``They think
we're lazy and stupid,'' said Manfred Schneider, a 70-year-old
former East German army officer who now earns about $4 an hour as a
security guard.
</P>
<P>
   Many Ossies express a gnawing anxiety over losing the
cradle-to-grave security that they enjoyed in the past even if they
lacked privacy and personal freedom. In a September survey, only 38
percent of east Germans said they were satisfied with democracy
compared to 60 percent in the west.
</P>
<P>
   Only 32 percent in the east favored continuing the free-market
economy. Most surprisingly, 51 percent of the Ossies said they were
happier in the communist German Democratic Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Rauschart, for one, said his life is far more difficult now. He
lives on $600 a month in government welfare. After paying the rent
on a subsidized one-bedroom apartment in the poor Hohenschoenhausen
district, Rauschart is left with about $250 for groceries and other
basics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough,'' he says bitterly. ``Lamb cutlets cost four
times more than they did before.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments have found political resonance. The Communists _
reborn as the Party of Democratic Socialism, or PDS _ are now
Germany's No. 2 political party behind Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder's Social Democrats. And in a potentially more worrisome
trend, the far-right German's Peoples Union won seats in two
eastern state parliaments.
</P>
<P>
   The PDS positions itself as a hip alternative to the capitalists
of the West that stresses social justice issues and a respect for
the old ways of the East. The party is by far the biggest in
eastern Germany with nearly 100,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Even more moderate East Germans express feelings of uneasiness
about unification, particularly the way their former identities
seem to have been lost in the transition.
</P>

   &UR; By DAVID PLOTZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is a (partial) list of objects that Martha Stewart has
gilded on recent TV shows: pomegranates, pumpkins, cookies,
chocolate truffles, wrapping paper, oak leaves, acorns, and--no
kidding--okra. The only thing Martha has not gildee lily.
But wait till it's back in season.
</P>
<P>
   Martha has proved that alchemy is not impossible: Brush enough
gold paint on enough flora, and eventually you'll make real gold.
The initial public offering last month for Martha Stewart Living
Omnimedia--Omnimedia, has there ever been a more perfect
name?--killed on Wall Street, rising from $18 to $52 on the first
day, before settling at $36.
</P>
<P>
   She arrived at the stock exchange that morning toting a tray of
brioches. She left that evening holding $1.2 billion (in stock, not
dough).
</P>
<P>
   Investors bought a brilliant company: Omnimedia--a Web site,
mail-order operation, two TV shows, two magazines, Kmart
partnership, and 27 books--netted $24 million last year from the
gospel of Martha. Kmart sold more than $750 million worth of
Martha-branded products in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Her 1997 decision to divorce Time Warner and go solo--a split
that cost her more than $50 million--has never looked better.
</P>
<P>
   What was missing from Martha's IPO was the sniping and mockery
that has dogged all of her ventures. Traditionally, Martha has been
battered by three criticisms. First, she is simply ludicrous. You
could not imagine better comic material than her ideas of
``living'': the ``midnight omelet dinner for 1,000''; the fruit
baskets the size of a Chevy; the advice (in this month's magazine)
to make your own envelopes out of wood veneer, folding them with a
bone knife.
</P>
<P>
   Parodies barely exaggerate when they imagine Martha turning
water into wine (''a lovely Merlot'') or manufacturing condoms from
her own lamb.
</P>
<P>
   A second and more thoughtful batch of critics has charged her
with encouraging class division, promoting soulless domestic
conformism, and undermining working women by making them feel
domestically inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   The final criticism has been personal. As her unauthorized
biography, ``Just Desserts,'' contends, Martha is an icy, horrible
person who abused her (now ex-) husband, ignores her daughter,
belittles her mother, sues her gardener for pennies, plagiarizes
recipes from better cooks, and humiliates her staff. Her fabled
``Remembering'' columns are a hash of bunkum and hyperbole. The
persona she cultivates--the warm, welcoming hostess with a
close-knit family--is a fraud.
</P>
<P>
   These criticisms have subsided partly because of America's
culture of financial idolatry. Anyone who's worth a billion on
paper is worth sucking up to.
</P>
<P>
   Martha is benefiting from parody fatigue as well. She has been a
figure of fun since ``Entertaining'' was published in 1982, so all
the jokes are old.
</P>
<P>
   And the vitality of the economy is inoculating her. Fripperies
that seemed obscene during the early '90s recession are quite
modest by the standards of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But the critical silence may also represent a long-overdue
recognition that Martha is, as she would say, a Good Thing. In a
Tuesday TV interview, she called herself a ``teacher. ... We are
offering information, high-quality, well-researched, how-to
information.'' That is a fair description.
</P>
<P>
   What she does is not silly at all, or at least no more silly
than most advice magazines. Her magazines and TV shows retain just
enough nonsense to make them irksome (''sew your own pashmina from
home-raised llamas,'' and the like), but she supplies valuable
instruction about the mundane tasks of life.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Stewart Living may be the most useful magazine this side
of Consumer Reports. This month's issue, for example, offers
excellent advice about making spicy popcorn snacks, cleaning ovens,
and storing rugs and china, among other subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Her weekly CBS morning segment packs more helpful cooking
information into six minutes than most cooking shows do in an hour.
</P>
<P>
   It is not false consciousness that makes tens of millions of
people follow Martha every month. It is her good advice.
</P>
<P>
   But the great achievement of Martha's domestic gospel is not
practical but moral. She has a puritanical sensibility. She
believes in the uplifting power of work. She instructs you so that
you will know how to create objects yourself, grow plants yourself,
learn home repair yourself, cook food yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Doing something well is good and liberating and fulfilling. It
strengthens friendships and families: When I saw her making waffles
the other day, it made me want to make waffles this Sunday. If I
make waffles on Sunday, I will invite the downstairs neighbors up
to eat them, and that is undoubtedly a Good Thing.
</P>
<P>
   Martha practices materialism, but not consumerism. She believes,
rightly, that it makes you wiser and happier to cook your own
applesauce than to buy it. Well, you may say, it's easy for her to
make homemade applesauce. That's her job. But she did it when it
wasn't her job, too.
</P>
<P>
   Even if most viewers rarely practice anything Martha
preaches--she calls such slackers ``Martha Dreamers'' as opposed to
``Martha Doers''--she is still a worthy goad.
</P>
<P>
   Her DIY credo makes Martha democratically snobbish. She hews to
a country-house sensibility, but anyone can follow it. It doesn't
cost much, because you do it yourself. If a middle-class Polish
girl like Martha can blossom into an affected, Breck-girl
faux-WASP, you can too!
</P>
<P>
   The final, and most important, reason Martha is escaping
criticism is that Martha Stewart the person has been separated from
Martha Stewart the brand. The principal topic of discussion about
the Martha Stewart Living IPO was Martha Stewart's death. Analysts
speculated what would happen to Omnimedia if Martha were hit by a
bus or cab (or succumbed to an accident in ``the potting shed,'' as
the New York Observer's Christopher Byron nicely put it).
</P>
<P>
   There were two answers: First, the company has bought a $67
million life-insurance policy on her. Second, Martha Stewart the
brand can survive without Martha Stewart the person, as Ralph
Lauren the brand survives without Ralph Lauren selling every shirt.
(Martha does not appear at all in the current issue of Living.) The
zooming stock price is evidence that Wall Street can distinguish
Martha from her product.
</P>
<P>
   We should do the same. Critics have savaged her fraudulent
persona and monomaniacal perfectionism for a long time. There is a
subtle sexism in that: The female domestic tycoon is obliged to
behave better than the guys. (This is why Oprah's private life is
examined more carefully than David Letterman's.)
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, commerce has trumped personality. Martha is finally
being treated as the CEO of a company called Omnimedia, not as a
bitchy hausfrau. In the age of the divine entrepreneur, no one
cares how badly you treat your kid. We admire perfectionist
monomania in Internet tycoons, so why not in Martha? Politicians
get away with advertising bogus family bliss; Martha should too.
</P>
<P>
   On television, Martha shows us how to make a romantic dinner for
the husband she doesn't have, host a party for the kids she doesn't
like, bake muffins for the neighbors who hate her.
</P>
<P>
   But those are her tragedies, not our business (or Wall
Street's). The muffins are still tasty, and that's what matters.

BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY REDUX 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: with sidebar FASHION-BOHEMIA-TIPS) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote ``Scandal in
Bohemia,'' he wasn't referring to Bohemian fashion, but the
new-again fashion stance does have tongues wagging.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion critic Mr. Blackwell hates it. ``It's fine if you're a
gypsy, but when all that color takes over, you can't see who's
wearing it ... and who wants to look like they're going to a
costume party,'' he quips.
</P>
<P>
   But it's those severely Plain Jane looks we've had for so many
years that have caused the backlash, says Maggie Murray, costume
curator at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, fashion bores itself and causes us to look for
something fun to brighten our lives,'' Murray said. ``And this year
it's the Bohemian babe.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time we saw this much bold mixing of colors and
textures was in the late '60s and early '70s, when flower children
and hippies shed their ladylike suits and panty girdles for braless
blouses, embroidered jeans, granny dresses and love beads. Leading
their gypsy caravan were Cher and Yves St. Laurent, the designer
who turned peasant costumes into haute couture.
</P>
<P>
   But the role model then _ and now _ was TV's original hippie
chick ``Rhoda,'' portrayed by Valerie Harper.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was shaking up the uptight fashions of the era with her
funny head wrap and layers of long, loose, colorful
Bohemian-inspired clothes that she actually wore to work as a
window dresser,'' Murray recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Rhoda's wardrobe symbolized the kind of change in style and
lifestyle that young people are learning more about in current TV
sitcoms such as ``Dharma &AMP; Greg'' and ``That '70s Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Says ``That '70s Show'' star Laura Prepon, ``I think the best
part about the '70s was that people weren't as worried about stuff.
I liked the clothes they wore, like the Bohemian look. It's
awesome, especially the feathers and beads. But not the tight
polyester stuff,'' she says, referring to the disco fashions at the
end of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Although Prepon grew up in the grunge generation, and has a
penchant for utility-chic khaki pants with zippers, she discovered
the charm of Bohemian style with a saucy pink peasant top.
</P>
<P>
   It's young women like her, says Halston designer Kevan Hall, who
are fueling the Bohemian trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about it, they've never lived through a colorful
era like their mothers did, so the Bohemian look is really new. And
older women, well, they're bored with recent fashion and have been
wanting color in their wardrobes for a long time,'' says the
Encino-based designer.
</P>
<P>
   The Bohemian style's popularity is based on color and
creativity, and works best when it has a handcrafted look, when
ordinarily plain-looking jeans, skirts and sweaters are embellished
with embroidery, beads, fringe, bands of ribbon, patchwork or tiny
mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   Although the look is exotic with touches of the Orient and
India, it's got an L.A. edge.
</P>
<P>
   California Designer of the Year William B. earned his recent
title with a collection of leopard and pony print skirts that had
hemlines dripping with beaded fringe and paired with snug sweaters
in eyebrow-raising shades of orange, pink and turquoise. While he's
certainly a front runner, he's not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the gypsy camp include ABS, Buzz 18, Eduardo Lucero,
Trina Turk and Estevan Ramos, plus veteran designer Carole Little,
who's never given up her flower child fantasy. Little's fall
collection looks fresher than ever with rich velour pants and tube
skirts topped by gauzy black peasant tops embroidered with big pink
roses; and she's got more of the Bohemian look for spring 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Even conservative designer David Dart has acknowledged the
Bohemian spirit with a fall collection of velvet dresses, pants and
jackets that create the perfect canvas for the season's bounty of
accessories _ from fringed scarves to beaded chokers and chandelier
earrings.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Mr. Blackwell might be right about the fashion trend being
campy, but then going to camp is supposed to be fun. &QL;

<P>
   MISSGOV _ JACKSON _ Absentee ballots, two tardy counties and
possibly even the state House could decide Mississippi's next
governor after Mike Parker and Ronnie Musgrove were unable to
deliver a knockout punch in their general election showdown.
Complete, but unofficial returns early today showed the race still
tight between the two men. Results showed Musgrove with 49.5
percent to Parker's 48.6 percent, setting up the possibility that
state representatives might have to pick between the two. Such a
step may be a first in Mississippi history. (Konigsmark, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   GORE-THORPE _ The first extended flap between Vice President
Gore and former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley centers on the
findings of one of Georgia's newest residents, Ken Thorpe, the
newly installed director of Emory University's health management
division. Gore referred indirectly to Thorpe during last week's
town hall meeting in New Hampshire to prove that Bradley's health
care plan would cost more than he claims it would. Bradley labeled
Thorpe a Gore ``partisan.'' Not so, says Thorpe, who acknowledges
he worked for Gore. ``I was just trying to treat them on equal
footing,'' he says. (Foskett, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 20.

</P>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ On the dance floor, Sheila Dreps holds out
her hand with the regal air of a queen expecting a courtier to kiss
it. After starting the dance, husband Tom goes into one move, while
Sheila begins another. Confusion reigns for a second, until Tom
asks with a smile, ``Where are you going?'' Scenes like this are
repeated on many nights along the coast of the Carolinas as couples
gather to shag. The sound and the steps synonymous with the coast
of the Carolinas are growing in popularity. While cities such as
Rocky Mount and Wilson have long had organized shag clubs, new
groups have formed in places such as Birmingham, Ala., and
Washington, D.C. (Chandler, Rocky Mount Telegram)

</P>
<P>
   TERESA _ CALCUTTA _ The decision lies ultimately with the
Vatican, but in July, the first part of a three-phase inquiry was
launched to gather evidence that could qualify Mother Teresa for
sainthood. Normally a prospective saint must be dead at least five
years before being considered, but Pope John Paul II has waived
that requirement. And in the streets of Calcutta where Mother
Teresa worked, enthusiasm is running high. A church panel is
looking into 60 reported miracles attributed to Teresa in Calcutta
and 40 more around the world. The Pope visits India Nov. 5-8.

may as well have frozen solid a decade ago as far as the workers at
the Vyborg Pulp and Paper Mill are concerned. The workers have
taken over the factory. Violent clashes with government security
forces have not moved them. Their demands are plain: kick out the
foreign investors, cancel plans to retool and update the factory
and put the mill back in the hands of the government. In short,
bring back the Soviet Union. (Holmes, Cox News Service). 18. WITH

RATING THE UNDERDOGS AND TOP CATS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Random comments on candidates for president:
</P>
<P>
   AL GORE: The vice president remains the odds-on favorite to win
the Democratic nomination despite his efforts to portray himself as
the underdog. The underdog shtick is about as believable as his
insistence that he's thrilled to have challenger Bill Bradley
breathing down his neck.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``disingenuous'' comes to mind. But then, what would we
expect from a politician who claims that he seemed wooden and
insincere in the past because he had to carefully ``vet'' his
opinions to be sure they conformed with his boss's policies?
</P>
<P>
   BILL BRADLEY: The former New Jersey senator has been taking the
high road, declining to respond to his opponent's criticism and
refusing to attack the vice president. Bradley might be on to
something; the American people have given every indication that
they've had it up to here with mudslinging and negative
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   STEVE FORBES: The magazine-publisher-turned-politician might be
smart to follow Bradley's example. Forbes is clearly emerging as
the leading cheap-shot artist among the Republican candidates _ a
distinction that is getting him some laughs and TV time but could
backfire.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes _ whose attack ads in the 1996 primaries did as much
damage to eventual nominee Bob Dole as anything the Democrats did _
aimed his fire at front-runner George W. Bush last week. Seems Bush
passed up a debate in New Hampshire so he could be with his wife in
Texas as she received an important honor from her alma mater; seems
Forbes thought that Bush's decision was cause for ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   And this from a candidate who says he's a crusader for family
values.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE W. BUSH: Bush said that he trusted the people of New
Hampshire to appreciate the priorities of a man who believes that
his wife is more important than a campaign appearance. That comment
by Bush showed a lot more respect for folks in the Granite State
than Forbes showed with his petty insults.
</P>
<P>
   JOHN MCCAIN: This is interesting. The Arizona senator is
suddenly under fire for his explosive temper. Wasn't it Bush who
was supposed to fly off the handle when the media started bearing
down on him?
</P>
<P>
   Bush hasn't shown so much as a flash of anger, while news
organizations from the The New York Times to The Arizona Republic
are saying that McCain is a good bet to throw a fit at the drop of
a hat. McCain's spokesfolks say that reports of his tendency to
blow his top have been highly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: Who cares? If a volatile temper is a
disqualification for the presidency, the current occupant of the
White House should have been impeached for felonious
tantrum-throwing instead of compulsive lying. President Clinton
evidently indulges his rage mostly behind closed doors, but he is
notorious for his temper.
</P>
<P>
   DONALD TRUMP: Here's another guy who didn't get the message
about the unpopularity of negative campaigning. The casino and real
estate baron is ``exploring'' the idea of seeking the Reform
Party's presidential nomination, and he kicked off the exploration
by calling rival Pat Buchanan a ``Hitler lover.''
</P>
<P>
   If Trump carries his presidential fantasy too far, though, he
might be the one who's the target for name-calling. One of his
ex-wives, Marla Maples, has promised to tell the world exactly what
she thinks of The Donald if he runs for president. It would almost
be worth seeing Trump's name on the ballot just to find out what
Marla has to say.
</P>
<P>
   PAT BUCHANAN: Do you suppose he really is a Hitler lover?
</P>
<P>
   ROSS PEROT: Ross who? Are we talking about that Dallas
billionaire who made a mess of the 1992 election as an independent
candidate for president and then bought himself a political party
so he would have an excuse to run again in 1996?
</P>
<P>
   That's the guy, all right. Perot hasn't uttered a squeak this
election season, but when it comes right down to it, will the
Scheming Little Weasel actually let Buchanan or Trump or Jesse
Ventura carry the banner for Perot's very own Reform Party?
</P>
<P>
   Don't bet on it.

week as part of New America News Service. Caldwell, a respected
Native-American poet, musician, writer and interviewer, chatted
with a number of Native-American artists and activists who have
challenged and helped reshape prevailing expectations about Native
cultures and identities during the late 20th century. A cover shot

   EL REY OF PUBLIC BROADCASTING. After a successful run as host of
National Public Radio's ``Talk of the Nation,'' Ray Suarez has
landed a dream job at the ``NewsHour with Jim Lehrer'' on PBS. This
move cements Suarez's position as one of the top journalists _ not
to mention Latino journalists _ working on national news programs
in the United States. In addition to his nose for news, keen
intellect and topnotch interviewing skills, Suarez will bring a
multicultural perspective that can surely benefit television news.
Katharine Diaz profiles Suarez in this excerpt from Hispanic
magazine.

<P>
   FROM HAITI TO AMERICA IN SERVITUDE. People who do not live in
South Florida probably have not heard of Charlyne _ the name the
Miami Herald gave to a 16-year-old girl in Pembroke Pines. She is a
restavec _ the Creole term for the turn-of-the-century institution
of involuntary child servitude in Haiti. More than a decade ago,
monied Haitian immigrants nationwide secretly imported the restavec
system to the United States. South Florida has the highest number
of restavecs in America. Restavecs get less attention in the United
States and elsewhere than do black slaves in the African nation of
Sudan, writes columnist Bill Maxwell. The Florida Department of
Children and Families is just now waking up to its responsibility
to protect these youngsters. ``The problem, of course, is that a
restavec, like the black slave of old, is an invaluable piece of
property, and, in most cases, those involved will remain silent,''
Maxwell writes.
</P>
<P>
   BURYING THE FACTS ON YOUTH VIOLENCE. Ever since the Columbine
High School shooting in April, Congress has been under increasing
pressure to do something about gun control and youth violence. The
Senate and the House passed separate versions of a new
juvenile-crime bill in the spring, and Republican leaders of both
houses are nearing agreement on a compromise. A national coalition
of children and youth organizations is worried about provisions in
both bills that would do away with dozens of court consent decrees
that have forced state prison systems to segregate juveniles from
adult prisoners. Also, both bills would allow federal prosecutors
to try youths as young as 13 as adults, increase mandatory
sentences and do away with confidentiality provisions in juvenile
courts. Columnist Juan Gonzalez reports.
</P>
<P>
   WE ONLY WANT WHAT WAS OURS TO BEGIN WITH. A kettle will be
returned to the Ho-Chunk people when all the legal documents are in
order, writes columnist Karen Lincoln Michel. It's a cast-iron
vessel that when covered with deerskin serves as a ceremonial drum
kettle used in Native-American Church religious rites. ``Quite
generous of the Wisconsin State Historical Society to give back the
sacred item to the rightful owner after holding it for more than 40
years,'' she writes. How would other churches react to their
religious paraphernalia being collected, catalogued and put on
display with a hodgepodge of items from other cultures? This week,
Michel reports on the kettle and other items that are being
returned to their rightful owners thanks to Native American Grave
Protection and Repatriation Act.

LASAGNA THAT'S FAMILY TESTED AND APPROVED (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several readers sent in the requested recipe for spinach
lasagna. Both of the ones we're printing came with personal stories
attached.
</P>
<P>
   The first recipe was sent by Barbara Rubin. ``This is my
sister's spinach lasagna _ Marcia Menuskin of Chattanooga, Tenn.
She has served it many times at family events, and I make it
frequently as a covered dish. It was published in our family
cookbook. The nicest part is you don't have to precook the
noodles.''
</P>
<P>
   The second recipe was sent by Pat Drechsel, Fort Worth. Her son
attended North Texas State University (now the University of North
Texas) in Denton in the 1980s. He enjoyed the lasagna at school and
brought his mother the recipe when it was printed in the local
newspaper.

CAN THE BISCUIT IDEA; DO REAL DUMPLINGS WITH CHICKEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If by some unfortunate circumstance you used canned biscuits to
make dumplings for your chicken and broth, as I might have
mentioned in my last column, for crying out loud go get them out.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think they will actually hurt you, but one reader
responded to the idea by issuing an e-mail that contained the words
``disgusting'' and ``nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   What I was trying to do with that obviously feeble aside about
prepared biscuits was to let people know it was possible to make
chicken and dumplings without rolling pins, billowing white clouds
of sifted flour, and gummy clods of dough disappearing in the
broth.
</P>
<P>
   I might as well have said it was OK to put ketchup in your red
beans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I ever have a bone to pick with you,'' started the e-mail
from Rebecca Griffis of Euless. ``... a pot of boiling broth and
chicken meat with the addition of bits of canned biscuit dough is
NOT chicken and dumplings!
</P>
<P>
   ``How do I know what I'm talking about?'' she asked
rhetorically. ``Because my grandmother and great-grandmother were
possibly the world's best dumpling cooks, and I have my
grandmother's own recipe.''
</P>
<P>
   The recipe: 1 1/2 cups unsifted flour, 1 egg, 1/4 cup milk, 1/4
cup salad oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon baking powder.
Beat the ingredients together until stiff. On a floured board, roll
the dough very thin and cut into 1-by-3-inch strips. Drop into
boiling broth with chicken and cook for 15 minutes over medium
heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going to tell them to make dumplings with canned
biscuits, you might as well just tell them to make dumplings with
flour tortillas,'' said one caller from Alvarado. ``One is just
about as bad as the other.''
</P>
<P>
   But Diane Lusk e-mailed that she had given up on finding good
chicken and dumplings until she tried some at her in-laws' in
Louisiana. The secret? Flour tortillas.
</P>
<P>
   Also, several people called to tell me one of the best places in
Fort Worth to try chicken and dumplings was Fernandez Cafe on West
Vickery. Fernandez uses flour tortillas.
</P>
<P>
   I was also prompted to try the chicken and dumplings at the
Paris Coffee Shop on Magnolia Street. I did, but that experience
presented a whole different set of problems. The chicken and
dumplings was good, but so too were the baked corn and mustard
greens it came with. Add the coconut-chocolate cream pie with
meringue so high you must raise your chin so the waitress can put
the plate on the table, and it is really too much for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   I worried in my column that chicken and dumplings was a dish on
the decline. I don't hear many home cooks talk about it. Perhaps, I
shouldn't have been concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read with interest your story on chicken and dumplings and
thought maybe you would be interested to know that they are alive
and well with us good ol' German girls,'' wrote Becca Krzystyniak.
``My dad's mom taught my mother who taught me, and I am working on
my daughters and everyone at Peace Lutheran Church and Northwest
High School. I make them by the gallons.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrie Rogers wrote from Keller to let me know that she and her
daughters made the dish just a weekend or so ago to welcome in the
``first cold weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Pam DeVoe of Fort Worth wrote that she uses her
great-grandmother's recipe. ``She also taught me a little trick to
make the final product even richer,'' DeVoe wrote. ``She would
always scramble a couple of eggs with some milk and add that to the
simmering broth right before serving.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeannette Seitz of Saginaw presented a recipe for a healthy,
low-fat version, and Dianna Almaroad of Grapevine sent a recipe she
said would always get compliments.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote: ``Sift about 3 cups of flour into a bowl and make a
well in the center. Add 1 cup of HOT broth, 1 tablespoon
shortening, 1 egg and 2 egg yellows. Mix until dough is stiff.
Chill a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flour board, divide dough for easier handling, roll out paper
thin and cut into 2-inch by 2-inch squares.''
</P>
<P>
   Almaroad says to drop the squares into the boiling broth, but
don't stir. Just use a long-handled spoon and ``jiggle.'' When all
the dumplings are in, return the boned chicken, season and cook for
20-30 minutes on medium-low heat.
</P>
<P>
   I tried this one, and it works a lot better than canned
biscuits.
</P>

NOTHING ELSE CAPTURES THE MISERY OF SLAVERY LIKE TONI MORRISON'S
`BELOVED'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few rare novels beg to be reread again and again. Valerie
Wilson Wesley, whose Tamara Hale mystery series established one of
the first female African-American private eyes on the bestseller
lists, feels that way about Toni Morrison's Pulitzer Prize-winning
``Beloved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That amazing story makes readers understand slavery in a way
you can feel down into your bones,'' Wesley says. ``I'm a fast
reader, but the first time I picked `Beloved' up, I could only read
a page or two at a time, because it was so painful.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison's narrative in ``Beloved,'' which won a Pulitzer, is
tough to mentally digest. Sethe, the protagonist and matriarch of a
post-Civil War black family in Ohio, is haunted by the memories of
a dead child _ and by a ghost. Much of the story involves
recollection of awful things done to slaves by masters, up to and
including a wife being used for sex while her husband has to hide
and watch.
</P>
<P>
   Sethe's post-slavery life is, for the most part, dominated by
her children. Yet her own needs cry out to be addressed, and her
tormented psyche can't be certain whose best interests should come
first.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps ``Beloved's'' greatest impact, though, comes from the
details. Morrison knows just how much to describe and how much to
leave to the imagination. Ever since the book's publication in
1987, reviewers have seized on her painstaking description of the
``bit,'' painful headgear that was fastened on the craniums of
rule-breaking slaves. You can't read about this without flinching.
</P>
<P>
   But Morrison skirts the kind of florid overwriting that would
tempt many other writers digging into atrocities associated with
slavery. Rape and mutilation are completely dealt with, yet not in
too much detail. It is probably true that, encouraged by Morrison's
literary hooks, readers' minds may imagine even worse things than
the author might have described had she overwritten.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen years after its initial publication, though, it is very
possible that ``Beloved'' remains a classic book that people think
they know enough about not to read. The Internet is crammed with
discussion pages about it _ more than two dozen, by unofficial
count. A mediocre Oprah Winfrey film may have left too many
audience members thinking the book wouldn't be any better. The
cinematic ``Beloved'' got lots of pre-release attention, but died
at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   But remember, two gemlike novels, ``Endless Love'' and ``The
Bonfire of the Vanities,'' were turned into lousy films that
eventually tarnished the reputation of the books on which they were
based.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since ``Beloved'' first hit bookstore shelves, Toni
Morrison has won the Nobel Prize for literature and has become one
of America's most famous authors. ``Beloved'' may not even be her
best book; ``Song of Solomon'' would challenge for that honor.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Valerie Wilson Wesley is right _ no book has ever
captured the pain of slavery so well. If that makes ``Beloved'' a
hard book to read, that's a tribute to the talent of the author. It
doesn't hurt us to wince once in a while, if we're wincing for the
right reason.

<P>
   READINESS KIT FOR A FAMILY
</P>
<P>
   Here's a list of items emergency experts recommend that you have
on hand to prepare for any emergency, not just potential Y2K
problems. These things should see you through a three-day weekend:
</P>
<P>
   _ Canned foods and nonperishable food
</P>
<P>
   _ Drinking water (1 gallon per person per day)
</P>
<P>
   _ Manual can opener and eating utensils
</P>
<P>
   _ Special dietary food if needed
</P>
<P>
   _ Personal papers (identification, insurance, financial and
prescriptions)
</P>
<P>
   _ Personal hygiene items _ soap, deodorant, shampoo, toothbrush
and toothpaste
</P>
<P>
   _ Eyeglasses and hearing aids
</P>
<P>
   _ Battery-operated radio
</P>
<P>
   _ Flashlights
</P>
<P>
   _ Extra batteries
</P>
<P>
   _ First-aid kit
</P>
<P>
   _ Sleeping bag or blankets and pillow in case the heat goes off
</P>
<P>
   _ Change of clothes
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   RUMOR CENTRAL
</P>
<P>
   RUMOR: Increased solar activity at the end of 1999 could cause
satellite systems to malfunction on or around Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   TRUE: Experts say that the next peak in solar flares or storms
on the sun's surface, which can interfere with normal satellite
operation, will occur in late 1999 and early 2000. Remember pagers
stopped beeping in May 1998 when increased solar activity affected
operations of the Galaxy 4 satellite.
</P>
<P>
   RUMOR: Nuclear missiles and other weapons are not Y2K-compliant
and will launch on Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   FALSE: No risk because procedures for launching nuclear weapons
involve multiple levels of code verifications and human interaction
to verify an order from the president. Computers by themselves
cannot launch nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   RUMOR: Y2K problems in federal prison facilities will cause cell
doors and gates to open, increasing the risk of prison escapes.
</P>
<P>
   FALSE: Controls on doors and gates are always managed by
correction officers. According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons,
doors and gates do not have Y2K vulnerabilities.
</P>
<P>
   RUMOR: Most elevator computers will fail.
</P>
<P>
   FALSE: Major elevator companies say that their elevators do not
depend upon calender-based data for operational purposes.
</P>
<P>
   RUMOR: The Federal Aviation Administration, certain that the air
traffic control system will not be ready by the turn of the
century, will ground all flights in the United States at 6 p.m.
Dec. 31 and not let any take off until 6 a.m. Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   FALSE: The FAA has no such plans; all systems are now
Y2K-compliant.
</P>
<P>
   RUMOR: The Year 2000 problem will cause pacemakers to
malfunction, including, as a worst case, failure to provide the
needed pacing output to sustain cardiac function.
</P>
<P>
   FALSE: Although computer software frequently is embedded as a
component in pacemakers, this software does not use date
information in the operation of the pacemaker itself.
</P>
<P>
   RUMOR: President Clinton plans to declare a national state of
martial law for the Year 2000 transition.
</P>
<P>
   FALSE: The president has no such intentions.

<P>
   AT HOME
</P>
<P>
   In Y2K circles, the word is to prepare for Jan. 1 as if it were
a long holiday weekend by having at least a three-day supply of
food and water. Opinions vary on how much water is needed, but
count on one gallon of water a day per person for drinking, cooking
and brushing teeth. Add another gallon per person for washing your
face.
</P>
<P>
   For a family of four, that comes to 12 to 24 gallons of water.
Toting just two gallons from the car to the fridge every week is
tough, so just imagine how difficult it will be to store that much
water.
</P>
<P>
   The cheap approach is to save those 2-liter plastic soda
bottles, rinsing them and filling with tap water. Those gallon milk
jugs will work, but they are easily damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Add three to four drops of unscented chlorine bleach per bottle
to kill bacteria. To sweeten the deal for young tastebuds (and, as
a bonus, to add extra vitamins), keep extra Tang on hand to flavor
the water, which tends to taste flat after storage, recommends
Karen Anderson, author of ``Y2K for Women'' (Sovereign Press,
$12.99 plus $4.99 shipping and handling from www.y2kwomen.com.)
</P>
<P>
   Here's another option for those who have water beds. Water beds
hold 200 gallons of water, but because they usually contain
chemicals, they should be considered nonpotable. The water can,
however, be used for such purposes as flushing toilets.
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time to make a personal assessment of items and
services that are crucial, including special needs of infants, the
elderly and people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Refill prescriptions when there's a five- to seven-day supply
remaining. The pharmaceutical industry is confident that this
standard practice will be adequate during Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Check with manufacturers to see if the essential electronic
equipment around the house is Y2K-ready, especially personal
computers, monitored security systems and programmable thermostats.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   TESTING COMPUTERS
</P>
<P>
   Home computers purchased within the last two years should not be
a problem, but older computers could be year-sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   Testing a computer is a matter of following the directions.
</P>
<P>
   For Apple/Mac users, refer to www.apple.com/about/year2000.
</P>
<P>
   The PC Year 2000 Alliance was created to help people find out if
their computers are ready for the new year. Its Web site is
www.pcy2000.org.
</P>
<P>
   To test a Windows-based personal computer, go to www.nstl.com.
Double-click on ``Year 2000 Testing Services,'' then click on
``YMARK2000'' and choose Download.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a step-by-step test listed on
www.y2k.gov/youth/how.html.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   PETS
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget Fido. Make sure that all pets _ from hamsters to
horses _ have plenty of food and water stockpiled, Karen Anderson
says. Buy canned food by the case. Dry food should be stored in a
cool, dry place away from heat and direct sunlight. Cat owners
should stockpile enough kitty litter to keep their felines from
getting fussy.
</P>
<P>
   Keep prescriptions and medical supplies on hand. Just like
people, pets will be cold should the electricity go out. Blankets,
comforters and other supplies fit for a four-legged friend should
be ready if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, don't overlook the special needs of small furry
friends, such as guinea pigs and hamsters, or exotic pets like
iguanas.
</P>

   SHORTAGES, ANYONE?

<P>
   The message from one Dallas-based Y2K-preparedness company is
that consumers shouldn't encounter shortages of grain mills, water
filters and other survival-oriented supplies, even though the end
of the year is near.
</P>
<P>
   That's because people have become complacent about the threat of
Y2K problems, says Phyllis Hopkins, who runs Best Prices Storable
Foods with her husband, Bruce. That means there are readily
available supplies of wind-up radios, organic seed sprouters and
water-purification drops for those who care to invest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Industry-wide, there's been a major slowdown,'' she said. ``A
lot of people are dumping a lot of stuff on the market. It's like a
lot of people turned the water off. It's not good for us, and it's
not good for people if there are problems.''

NOT 2 WORRY _ BUT R YOU READY FOR Y2K?
</HEADLINE>
 By JAN JARVIS and JOHN AUSTIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why worry about Y2K?
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the attitude adopted by most people the closer
they get to Jan. 1, 2000. At town meetings and gatherings, few
folks have expressed serious concerns about what will happen when
the clock strikes midnight.
</P>
<P>
   If she had to pick one topic that has raised concerns, Shannon
Porterfield, the Texas Y2K project director, said it's probably
banking, but even those concerns have been few.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell if people think everybody is going to be fine and
they aren't worried or if they're waiting to worry about it until
it gets closer,'' Porterfield said.
</P>
<P>
   With that thought in mind, here's a rundown from experts on how
to prepare for Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   BANKING
</P>
<P>
   For those who are tempted to bury a bunch of bucks in the back
yard or tuck a few extra bills under the mattress, the banking
industry offers this advice: DON'T DO IT.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, keep the money in the bank, where it is safe, sound and
FDIC-insured. Money will still be accessible through teller
withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   Withdrawing large amounts of cash _ not that anyone will have
any the week after Christmas _ is also a bad idea. Criminals will
be ready to pounce on anyone who is spotted leaving a bank or ATM
with loaded pockets and a false sense of security.
</P>
<P>
   Experts recommend withdrawing only what is normally needed for a
long weekend and doing it before Dec. 31. Even better, keep the
cash in the bank and use traveler's checks, credit cards and debit
cards.
</P>
<P>
   This is probably a good time for those who have never balanced a
checkbook to get into the habit. Reconcile account statements, file
receipts, make copies of records. Keep good records for the last
few months of 1999 through January 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Pay attention, check for accuracy and compare receipts against
bank statements. Also check your credit report to make sure it does
not contain inaccurate information.
</P>
<P>
   Do not fall prey to schemes and scams. Carefully check
credentials before paying for anything. Do not withdraw money from
savings accounts to invest in companies or products that claim to
fix Y2K problems. Protect personal information, including numbers
of bank accounts and credit cards and your Social Security number.
</P>
<P>
   For the latest info on Y2K scams, call the Federal Trade
Commission hot line at (888) USA-4-Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL
</P>
<P>
   Those who plan to be on the road over the holiday weekend can
count on running into plenty of fellow travelers. The odds are good
that some of those drivers will be drinking. Add the possibility of
a winter storm to the equation, and you get a potentially negative
New Year's night.
</P>
<P>
   To turn the weekend into a positive experience, experts
recommend starting off with a properly maintained vehicle. Make
sure the gas tank is full.
</P>
<P>
   Stock normal emergency supplies in the trunk. An emergency car
kit should include battery-powered radio and extra batteries,
flashlights and extra batteries, blanket, booster cables, fire
extinguisher (5-pound A-B-C type), first-aid kit and manual,
bottled water and nonperishable, high-energy foods such as granola
bars, raisins and peanut butter.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving, take the weather into consideration. Also check
out road conditions and make sure routes are open.
</P>
<P>
   Expect delays on the road and allow ample time for travel.
</P>
<P>
   If you have one, keep your state's stranded-motorist hot line
number handy, and use it in case of an emergency anywhere in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Let family members and friends know your itinerary and whether
there is a change of plans.
</P>
<P>
   If traffic lights malfunction or go dark, do not assume that
it's safe to proceed. Rely on traffic laws and courtesy as guides
and never force the right of way. Approach intersections with
caution. Use common sense.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers planning to take to the skies can expect a smooth
ride, with some exceptions. All FAA computer systems are fully
compliant for the year 2000. After more than three years, 1,000 FAA
technical experts have made repairs and successfully implemented or
installed equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, there is a need for further readiness on the part of
air carriers, airports and traffic systems.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Y2K CARS
</P>
<P>
   Major carmakers and the American Automobile Association report
that cars and trucks should be unaffected by Y2K. Computers in cars
do not keep track of the year in order for the car to run.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   EMERGENCIES
</P>
<P>
   Above all else, remember, DO NOT DIAL 911 at midnight Jan. 1,
2000, just to see if there's a dial tone.
</P>
<P>
   Resist the temptation even to pick up the phone as the clock
strikes midnight. If too many people do, it could create a backlog
and clog the lines for those who truly have an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Folks who fear that they won't be able to call 911 during an
emergency can protect themselves by learning the seven-digit number
for police emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Play it safe by posting the numbers next to the telephone.

HACKER DEFACE U.S. AIR FORCE WEB SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The Internet site at Lackland Air Force Base in
San Antonio was defaced last weekend by a group of Pakistani-based
hackers whose members vow to target U.S. government and military
Web sites in a bid to win independence for Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistan Hackerz Club's founder, identifying himself as
``Doctor Nuker,'' said in an exchange of e-mail messages with the
San Antonio Express-News that his group also had hacked into the
Internet site at Ingleside Naval Base near Corpus Christi, Texas,
along with 11 others as it battles on behalf of Kashmir, a
territory between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   By one estimate, the group has struck some 85 sites since it
first began its hacking spree, hitting a variety of civilian and
military in numerous nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will deface more government and military sites,'' he
warned.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force said the Lackland attack occurred Friday. The
Ingleside attack took place Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistan Hackerz Club, said by one local expert to be the
most prolific of 50 individual and group ``Web defacers''
worldwide, left its initials, PHC, in yellow over both Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   A rambling diatribe against Indian ``repression'' in Kashmir
followed on the Lackland Web page, with a similar message appearing
on the Ingleside site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The champions of human rights, who were propelled into action
because of ethnic cleansing of the Kosovars, have chosen to
disregard the even more serious repression in Kashmir,'' Doctor
Nuker wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Lackland site, used to provide public information about the
installation, its commanders and activities, was taken offline,
said Lt. Denise Kerr, a base spokeswoman. It was back online
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The group defaced yet another site run by the Energy Department
in Albuquerque, N.M., on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The intrusion into the Energy Department's operation's office
took place sometime after 6 p.m. The department initially appeared
unaware of the attack, but by 6:35 p.m. was reinstalling the Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the online equivalent of spray-paint tagging,'' said
David McGroty, a programmer and Web master with Sahara Digital, an
Alamo City firm that tests computer systems' vulnerability to
hackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of finding that virtual underpass and
spraying your message there so as many people as possible can see
it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokeswoman Debra Weierman said she had no information on
the recent hacking incidents at the San Antonio and Ingleside
military Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   She said FBI and Justice Department policy forbids discussing
any ongoing investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But computer hacking and network intrusion, a federal crime, has
sharply increased. Michael Vatis, director of the FBI's National
Infrastructure Protection Center, last month told a Senate panel
that his agency's caseload has doubled in each of the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, he told the Senate Judiciary Committee, has more than
800 pending investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Malicious and intentional hacking that causes more than $5,000
damage is punishable by a maximum of five years in federal prison,
Justice Department spokesman John Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   Those involved in accidental intrusions which leave no damage
can be jailed for up to six months, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hackers also can be charged with violating federal wiretap laws,
a crime with a 10-year prison term.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre said in February that the
Pentagon is detecting 80 to 100 potential hacking events daily.
</P>
<P>
   Hacking, though, plagues a host of other countries and regions
as well, particularly Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent commentary headlined ``Nerd World War,'' the
Economist magazine cited a report indicating 72,000 ``cyberspace
attacks'' were launched from China against Taiwan in August.
Taiwanese hackers struck back, cracking Web sites operated by the
Chinese tax and railway agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, such high-profile organizations as the Johnson
Space Center in Houston, ABC, the Drudge Report and George Magazine
were attacked by two groups, hackingforgirliez and
unitedloangunmen.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on George Magazine came Oct. 26, a few months after
the death of its founder, John F. Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The message, ``Remember me for I was murdered,'' contained the
date of Kennedy's death with another message, ``Unitedloangunmen
points the finger at the Bush administration of the Illuminati and
Committee of 300.''
</P>
<P>
   The word ``murdered'' turns crimson when a computer mouse
crosses it, and leads to a link containing theories about the plane
crash that claimed the lives of Kennedy, his wife and a
sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   While it's hard to know what the message is, or if the message
is a joke, that isn't the case with Pakistan Hackerz Club, said
McGroty, who noted the group puts a new missive on each web site it
hacks _ some including photos of apparently dead and injured
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``They obviously have a real cause to support,'' he said.

AIRLINE DISASTERS COULD INCREASE IN COMING DECADES, ANALYSTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The loss of more than 200 lives in the crash of
an Egyptian airliner off New England last weekend may be an omen of
international air disasters to come, aviation experts warn.
</P>
<P>
   As air travel becomes increasingly popular around the world, the
aviation death rate _ which has plunged in recent decades thanks to
improved technologies, training and aviation management _ could
again soar, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about the prospect, NASA and the Federal Aviation
Administration are in a race against time.
</P>
<P>
   New technologies are in the works, such as ``synthetic vision,''
an airline pilot's version of Superman's X-ray vision. A
synthetic-vision computer screen would enable a pilot to ``see'' _
through the thickest clouds and stormiest skies _ potential dangers
for miles around: mountains, skyscrapers, TV towers, other planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``As commercial air traffic increases, we will see more
accidents, unless we revolutionize the entire air transportation
system,'' NASA administrator Daniel Goldin warned the World
Aviation Congress meeting in San Francisco two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Air traffic has increased by about 20 percent over the last 10
years. ``So if the (accident) rate stays the same, (but) you fly
more, then you have more accidents,'' says Jim Burin, director of
technical programs at the Flight Safety Foundation, a consortium of
airline industry groups that is based in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the FAA
plan to spend about a half-billion dollars by 2002 on a joint
aviation safety research program, says Mike Lewis, head of the
space agency's program in aviation safety at its Langley Research
Center in Hampton, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The concern is international. Aviation is increasingly popular
around the world, thanks at least partly to international economic
growth. It is expected to triple over the next two decades,
according to NASA.
</P>
<P>
   That's ominous partly because U.S. aviation safety standards are
extremely high compared with much of the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1996 NASA report on the future of aviation,
``Toward A Safer 21st Century,'' the United States ``accounts for
about half the world's air travel, but only 8 percent of fatalities
on airlines around the world since 1990.''
</P>
<P>
   But experts point out that air travel remains the safest form of
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   As many people are killed in U.S. highway accidents in three to
four months as have died in all airplane crashes ever _ 13,000 in
all, according to a NASA report on the Web at
www.aero-space.nasa.gov/ library/ch.1.htm.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could go on a flight every day for 10,000 years and not be
in a fatal aircraft accident,'' says Charles H. Huettner, director
at aviation safety research at NASA headquarters in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Or in the words of a NASA report on aviation safety research:
``Today, the majority of newly hired commercial pilots are likely
to go through an entire career and never have to shut down an
engine in flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite aviation's safety record, President Clinton in 1997
called for reducing fatal aviation accidents by 80 percent by the
year 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Can such an ambitious target be attained so fast?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a challenging goal,'' Lewis says. ``The challenge, as I
see it, is not so much the 80 percent as the time frame. There's
quite a large fleet (of planes) out there, and . . . it takes so
much time to get that (new) technology on the fleet.''
</P>
<P>
   To reach that goal, NASA and the FAA have targeted two major
causes of aviation accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The first is known as ``controlled flight into terrain.'' In
this case, a well-functioning plane accidentally flies into the
ground or other obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, it ``has caused more than half of all
commercial aviation fatalities,'' the NASA report says.
</P>
<P>
   The second major cause is approach and landing accidents, which
account for half of aviation mishaps.
</P>
<P>
   The two causes accounted for 80 percent of deaths from 1979 to
1991, according to the Flight Safety Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Often times flight problems occur when pilots sometimes find
themselves lost in bad weather or dark, unfamiliar terrain.
</P>
<P>
   A possible solution: the synthetic-vision scheme. The pilot's
cockpit would include a computer screen depicting what would be
seen during fine weather. The scene would be constructed using a
database of images from satellites and other sources.
</P>
<P>
   To enrich the database, NASA plans to launch, late this year, an
Earth-mapping satellite that would gather highly accurate terrain
data.
</P>
<P>
   Better weather information is coming to airplanes, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today,'' Goldin complained, ``anyone with cable television can
get a better picture of the nation's weather than a pilot in
flight.'' So ``we've established partnerships with four separate
teams to show how to bring an `Aviation Weather Channel' into the
cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking about a 3-D depiction of complex weather patterns
that clearly shows the locations of hail shafts and wind shear,
lightning and storm cells. It'll give us a pathway _ a highway in
the sky _ for safely navigating through nearly any weather
condition.''
</P>
<P>
   An on-board camera able to see through bad weather is being
developed by NASA-Langley and TRW Space &AMP; Electronics Group in
Redondo Beach. The camera senses objects by detecting their
millimeter-wave electromagnetic radiation, which the human eye
can't see.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Matthews, president of the Flight Safety Foundation, said
at the Corporate Aviation Safety Seminar in Cincinnati in April.
``If the accident rate is not reduced significantly, in 12 to 15
years we will be experiencing two times, or even three times, the
number of accidents we have today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, there are signs that this increase already may be
happening. ... For the economic good of the industry, as well as
for obvious moral reasons, it is imperative that the already low
accident rate be reduced significantly in the same time scale.''

closely. That mom may be harboring the longings of a 16-year-old
girl.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Hodgman dedicated her second cookbook to Keanu Reeves,
``because I just love him. `Speed' had just come out when I wrote
that cookbook, and he was on my mind. I never sent him a copy of
the book, so I'm sure he hasn't seen it, but that's OK. It makes it
more pure that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Not the sort of comment you'd expect from a 43-year-old,
stay-at-home Connecticut mother of two children, especially a mom
who has made her living writing more than 40 children's books.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Hodgman has shown even more hipness with her newest
cookbook, ``One Bite Won't Kill You'' (Houghton Mifflin, $15), a
book that's subtitled, ``More than 200 recipes to tempt even the
pickiest kids on Earth and the rest of the family too.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no home-pureed baby food here, nor goofy garnishes to
disguise food or tempt finicky palates. This is straight-ahead fare
that kids will eat with little or no complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mealtime should not be a time when everyone is unhappy,''
Hodgman said in a phone interview. ``Everyone is tired at the end
of the day, and the less tension the better. I say that from having
sat through meals when I was young that were full of negotiation
and crying. But they do have to try one bite. If they don't like
it, fine. They can fix themselves some cereal or some soup, but I
will not make them anything else. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids need to know how to push food around on their plates. At
a friend's house they can't very well blurt out, `I hate this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hodgman is equally sanguine about soft drinks and candy and the
assorted junk that children adore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very into candy when I was a kid, and I think it's
because my parents were very strict and rationed it. I think that
made me want it more,'' Hodgman said. ``I don't have candy sitting
around the house, but my kids can buy candy when we're out. I don't
keep snacks in the house or soft drinks. But if we go out to dinner
and my husband and I are having a before-dinner drink, the kids can
have a soft drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids need to be doing what their friends are doing, and if the
kids are drinking soft drinks, that's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One Bite Won't Kill You'' is full of food that kids will
recognize, and Mom and Dad will probably remember. Dishes like
goulash and stab-your-own meatballs (yes, the ones with the grape
jelly) are suburban classics _ and for good reason. Recipes for
peanutty carrots, husky corn and broc bake appeal to vegetarians
(including Hodgman's 15-year-old daughter).
</P>
<P>
   Hodgman has thoughtfully given starring roles to ingredients she
calls ``dead frogs'' _ items that send most children into fits of
revulsion. Onions, mushrooms, green flecks, you know the cast.
</P>
<P>
   Although she is casual about some aspects of food (not all the
spices are mandatory), she can be a storm trooper on some subjects.
She is insistent on unsalted butter, and she writes that ``anyone
who's ever in charge of refreshments at a church or synagogue or
post-piano-recital reception is a total pig if they don't make
something just as nice for the kids as for the adults. What kind of
message does it send a child if all the grown-ups at church have
nice homemade cookies and the kids' table has nothing but some old
crackers?''
</P>
<P>
   Hodgman feels that time broadens children's menu choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never ate salad until I went to college,'' she said. ``Peer
pressure takes care of a lot of things, too, because they don't
want to look like babies. And I think there must be some biological
change in their palates, too, because my kids are eating a lot more
spicy food than they used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as unlikely as Hodgman _ Harvard graduate, alumni of the
``Harvard Lampoon'' and writer of Nancy Drew books _ is her partner
in this cookbook. It's Roz Chast, the cartoonist of everyday angst.
</P>
<P>
   Chast, of ``New Yorker'' fame, did the illustrations. Chast, too
(in the words of Hodgman), is ``a soccer mom. She lives about a
half-hour from me in the suburbs. They have a parakeet and a van.''

 &HT;    MEXICO'S PRIMARY ELECTION, BY THE NUMBERS
 &HT;    With MEXICO-PRIMARY-$ADV07.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Nov. 7 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO'S PRIMARY ELECTION AT-A-GLANCE
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WHEN: Sun., Nov. 7, polls open between 8 a.m. CDT and 6 p.m.
CDT (9 a.m. and 7 p.m. EDT).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WHY IT'S IMPORTANT: This is the first time Mexico's
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has held a primary election
to select the party's presidential candidate. The party has
controlled Mexico's presidency for 70 years. Mexico's president has
always selected who would be the party's nominee in previous
elections. The primary winner will run against at least two strong
opposition candidates on July 2, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WHO IS RUNNING: The top two contenders in a tight race are
Francisco Labastida, former interior minister and agriculture
minister in President Ernesto Zedillo's administration, and Roberto
Madrazo, former governor of Tabasco state. The other two contenders
are Manuel Bartlett, former governor of Puebla state; and Humberto
Roque Villanueva, former PRI congressional leader.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WHO IS SUPERVISING: Because Mexico's electoral law doesn't
cover primaries yet, the PRI is supervising its own election. All
candidates are allowed to have representatives at precincts to
monitor the balloting and the counting.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WHO CAN VOTE: Any Mexican with a voter credential is invited
to participate, not just PRI members. About 6.5 million voters
expected to turn out. There are 58.1 million Mexicans eligible to
vote. Out of that number 54.5 million Mexicans have active voter
credentials, which are frequently used in Mexico as an
identification card.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WHO WINS: Mexico has 300 electoral districts of varying sizes
nationwide. The winner of a majority of those districts not the
winner of the total number of direct votes will become the nominee.
Nov. 10 is when all returns should be counted. Nov. 18 is the final
deadline for announcing the winner. And on Nov. 20 the winner will
be sworn in as the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   OTHER NUMBERS AT A GLANCE:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ballots mailed out to 300 districts: About 16 million
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Voting stations: 64,500
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bottles of indelible ink to mark voters' thumbs to ensure they
only vote once: 140,000
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Observers: 193,500 trained observers from the PRI's ranks will
supervise, along with up to 258,000 observers representing the
candidates. Each candidate is allowed one representative per voting
station.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ballots available at each voting station: An average of 220,
but bigger districts are supposed to have more.

 &HT;    PROBLEM WITH WEIGHT IS MORE ABOUT EATERS THAN WHAT THEY EAT
 &HT;    Moving in Washington (w) and Lifestyle (l) categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The reasons that too many Americans are too fat
have more to do with what's in their heads than with what's on
their plates.
</P>
<P>
   That's the collective wisdom from the experts in dietary
behavior who gathered at the U.S. Agriculture Department on
Wednesday for a symposium on ``Why We Choose the Foods We Eat.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that a populace obsessed with fat and calories and
vitamins and other elements of food has been so unsuccessful in
merely consuming a healthy diet, several researchers agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Journal of the American Medical Association reported
last week that Americans are eating more than ever, exercising
little, and getting fatter each year. More than half the population
is overweight and nearly 18 percent are obese -- weighing more than
30 percent above healthy body weight.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is more about the eaters than what's being eaten.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to figure out what motivates people so you can try
to help them modify their diets,'' said Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main challenge to improved nutrition is not in improving
foods but in improving the way individuals and society think about
food, pleasure and health,'' concluded Paul Rozin, a psychology
professor at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Since food is relatively cheap across America, most people eat
whatever they want to eat -- largely food that tastes good to them,
said Adam Drewnowski, director of Nutritional Sciences at the
University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than just concentrating on what people should eat to be
healthy, he said, ``we need to understand what factors drive
consumer food choices in modern society.''
</P>
<P>
   The American culture is full of contradictions about eating,
said Rozin. For example, Americans are extremely well informed
about the risk factors of foods. But Americans are not well trained
in understanding risks, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to classify food as 'good' or 'bad.' If it's
'bad', they think you shouldn't eat any of it,'' he said. Taking
fat and salt as examples, he said, ``it's not true that if a lot is
bad for you, a little is bad for you, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Like rats and cockroaches, humans can eat almost anything, Rozin
said. So what people choose to eat is usually a mental rather than
physiological process.
</P>
<P>
   A ``Used Food Cafe'' that featured great food with just a bite
taken out would flop -- not because of sanitation but because of
sensibilities, he said. Likewise, Americans don't eat turkey on
Thanksgiving because of the nutrition of poultry but because of
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The thin-is-in culture has put such pressures about eating on
the college women he teaches, said Rozin, that many are too
embarrassed to buy a chocolate bar at a store. ``We are spoiling
our relationship with food,'' he lamented.
</P>
<P>
   Americans could learn from the French in developing a healthy
food culture, Rozin said. The French have less cardiovascular
disease than do Americans, even though the French diet is higher in
saturated fats and the French people have a higher blood
cholesterol level.
</P>
<P>
   ``The French focus more on food as an eating experience as
opposed to a set of chemicals that affect the body,'' said Rozin.
``They eat less than we do, eat longer meals and have a relaxed
attitude toward eating.''
</P>
<P>
   Common sense about healthy eating could go a long way in the war
against unhealthy fat, some psychologists said.
</P>
<P>
   Children learn how much they are supposed to eat from how much
is put on their plate, said Leann Birch, head of Penn State's
Department of Human Development and Family Studies. ``Portions
larger than recommended servings may promote overeating in
children.''
</P>
<P>
   People eat food that tastes good, said Drewnowski. ``These foods
are often sweet and rich in fat.''
</P>
<P>
   But taste can be altered, he said, recommending that ``we
fortify food with extra taste'' as is routinely done with vitamins
and other nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   A baby's taste is working at birth, research has shown. By the
age of four months, infants show a preference for salty tastes.
Even in young children, environmental and psychological factors
often override an inate ability to regulate calorie intake.
</P>
<P>
   Banning unhealthy snacks can backfire, though, and push children
to eat more of the forbidden food when their parents aren't around,
warned Birch.

BRIMMING WITH ANSWERS ABOUT HAT ETIQUETTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I'm a teacher and want to give a good reason for students to
remove hats when coming into school. What's the story behind this
rule of etiquette for men?
</P>
<P>
   _ S.M., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: The tradition is credited to King John of England, who ruled
from 1199 to 1216 and is better known for agreeing to the Magna
Carta. ``Kings expected people around them to show respect by
uncovering their heads when the monarch was in their midst,'' said
Jean Mitchell, a hat historian and owner of the Hattitudes shop in
Essex, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The general rule has been that men should remove their hats when
indoors and women should keep them on unless the hat is considered
male attire _ such as a baseball cap. Today, many people at
weddings and other formal occasions keep their hats on, Mitchell
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With today's gender equality, some of those rules are becoming
passe,'' she said. ``People wear western hats and baseball caps and
leave them on all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   To ask Mitchell a question about hat etiquette, call Hattitudes
at (860) 767-0775 or visit the Web site www.hattitudes.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I find a Morris Minor club in the area?
</P>
<P>
   _ L.C., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: There doesn't appear to be a club in Fort Worth-Dallas, but
you can find 750 North American owners and enthusiasts of the
British car in the Morris Minor Registry.
</P>
<P>
   The club publishes a bimonthly newsletter with tips, meet
reports and other features. Membership dues are $20 per year.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, write to Morris Minor Registry, 318
Hampton Park, Westerville, OH 43081-5723, or visit the Web site
hometown.aol.com/morrisminr/page.
</P>
<P>
   The Morris Minor, which is sometimes confused with a Volkswagen
Beetle, was billed as the ``world's supreme small car'' at its
launch. More than 1.6 million were produced from 1948 to 1971.
</P>
<P>
   The Morris Minor Owners Club, a British group, publishes an
extensive Web site at www.morrisminoroc.co.uk.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know that the Walt Disney movie ``The Love Bug'' had
several sequels. What were they, and when did they come out?

SUPREME COURT: A HIDDEN ISSUE IN NEXT YEAR'S ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 7)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The seven men and two women who deliberate in robed
isolation within the great marble edifice of the Supreme Court will
not be on the minds of many voters when they cast their ballots for
the next president.
</P>
<P>
   But the outcome of that voting could determine the philosophical
makeup of the high court for years to come _ and thus how the 1787
Constitution and its 1791 Bill of Rights are applied to people's
daily lives in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of New Hampshire's Oct. 28 town meeting, the five
participating Republican presidential contenders were asked to cite
the best and worst domestic policies that America has embarked on.
</P>
<P>
   Utah's Orrin Hatch, who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee,
replied that ``one of the worst things I've seen is the way some of
our federal judges have become activists on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have usurped the power of the other two branches of
government and have started to become super-legislators on the
bench in black robes. And they have violated the real role of
judging, which is to interpret the laws, not make the laws.''
</P>
<P>
   The next president could nominate 50 percent of the high court,
Hatch said, adding that by virtue of his experience he should be
the one to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the ages and health problems of some current court
members, it is indeed possible that half the court could be chosen
by the next president.
</P>
<P>
   By next November, Justice John Paul Stevens will be 80; Chief
Justice William Rehnquist, 76, and Sandra Day O'Connor, 70. Health
problems have plagued some of the justices, including Ruth Bader
Ginsberg, 66, who recently underwent surgery for colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   When Patrick Buchanan officially became a contender for the
presidential nomination of the Reform Party, he too condemned the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is a self-governing people doing meekly waiting each week
for nine jurists to tell us how we may live and how we should
govern ourselves?'' Buchanan demanded. He promised to ``herd the
justices back into the narrow stalls,'' where they would be guided
only by the ``original intent'' of the Founding Fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson rarely
misses an opportunity to attack federal judges and to promise that
a Republican president would nominate conservative justices rather
than activists.
</P>
<P>
   But, ironically, seven of the nine current justices were
nominated by Republican presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nixon named Rehnquist to the court, and Ronald Reagan
promoted him to chief justice. Stevens was named by Gerald Ford and
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy by Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush nominated David Souter and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Only Ginsberg and Stephen Breyer were nominated by Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist, Scalia and Thomas are the court's doctrinaire
conservatives, although Kennedy and O'Connor frequently vote with
them. Stevens, Souter, Ginsberg and Breyer are usually considered
moderates.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he had made any mistakes as president, Dwight
D. Eisenhower replied: ``Yes, two, and they both are sitting on the
Supreme Court.'' He was referring to Earl Warren and William
Brennan, whose liberal activism was at odds with Ike's moderate
conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Justices and Presidents,'' Henry J. Abraham noted
that Warren was not a great lawyer or legal scholar. Yet, Abraham
wrote, ``he was the chief justice par excellence _ second in
institutional-leadership greatness only to John Marshall himself in
the eyes of most impartial students of the court. ... ''
</P>
<P>
   In January 1801, John Adams, who had been defeated for
reelection but remained in the White House awaiting Thomas
Jefferson's inauguration, nominated Marshall to be chief justice,
and he was confirmed by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall immediately began to exert strong leadership over the
court, which was then held in low repute. Two years later he
introduced the doctrine of judicial review, which gave the court
the power to declare legislation unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution, Marshall said, is a dynamic document that was
``intended to endure for ages to come and consequently to be
adapted to the various crises of human affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   When Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the frontrunner in the
Republican presidential sweepstakes, was asked recently what
criteria he would employ in selecting Supreme Court justices, he
said he would not have any litmus tests, including abortion.
</P>
<P>
   That is the way it should be. Prospective justices should not be
forced to reveal in advance how they might rule on a given issue.
</P>
<P>
   In its current session, the court could clarify such matters as
the separation of church and state, especially in cases involving
taxpayer-supported vouchers for parochial school tuition and
student-led prayer at graduations and sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   In the years ahead, the court probably will take a new look at
such issues as abortion, racial issues, education, flag burning and
campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected that a president will nominate for court
membership an individual who shares his philosophy and values. But
once a justice is confirmed and has lifetime tenure, he or she is
free to be guided by personal conscience and interpretation of the
Constitution _ nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   That was decreed by the Founders and is part of the genius of
our constitutional system. Unfortunately, it is something that
politicians often fail to understand or accept.

   NY-MARATHON-WHEELCHAIRS (New York) _ For wheelchair athletes,
the New York City Marathon has always been a bittersweet event.
Though it is the largest marathon in America, it has never had a
separate division with prizes for wheelchair athletes. Several
times over the years athletes have complained that they were held
up to let foot racers pass. This year, however, the race is being
held against the backdrop of a lawsuit filed last July in Federal
Court in Brooklyn, in which nine wheelchair athletes alleged that
the marathon's organizers had repeatedly discriminated against them
under the Americans with Disabilities Act. By Jesse McKinley.

   BUILDING-SUPER (New York) _ James Healey owns three computers, a
constantly ringing cellular telephone and oversees 33 employees.
His workday starts at 7 a.m. sharp, firing off e-mail messages to
staff, clients and board members. Sounds like a typical executive
climbing the corporate ladder, but in this case the corporation is
the San Remo apartment building on Central Park West, and the
ladder that Healey is climbing leads not a corner office but to a
suite _ where he works as the building's superintendent. Sorry,
``resident manager.'' By Kimberly Stevens.

   NY-LOFT (New York) _ Over 25 years of marriage, Steven and
Judith O'Connor have moved 18 times, from a small nondescript
apartment in Iran with a Turkish toilet to a heavily shuttered home
in Athens where they lived shortly after the collapse of the
Papadopoulos regime. Then there was the cedar-paneled house
overlooking a sound in Bermuda, the tile-roofed hacienda in Phoenix
and the suburban rendition of a Provencal manor in Dobbs Ferry,
N.Y. Finally, just a loud honk from the Holland Tunnel, they're
putting down roots. But for the first time, the couple say, they're
in terra incognita, in a territory mapped by architects. Where once
they traveled freely with little more than what they could stow
under an airplane seat, now their roots are planted in blue
Brazilian granite, laminated glass and blackened steel plate. By

apartment, East Side 20's close to everything,'' boasts one. The

house. Social changes, however, have ensured that today everyone is
in the kitchen, and happy to be: teenagers, children, men, the
elderly and, yes, women. So, what's wrong with that? The kitchen,
says Jane Langmuir, an architect. It hasn't caught up. ``We get
coded at a very early age by memories of the place we grew up in,
and think, `Why change it?''' Ms. Langmuir said. ``But that kitchen
was designed for a single person, 5-foot-6. And when you start
putting everyone else in, it's not going to work very well.'' By

 &HT;    Four millennia of cookbooks
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For as much as has been written about food, only a few actual
recipes survive from ancient times. According to food historian
Clifford A. Wright, few recipe books predate the 13th century, and
it wasn't until the late 17th century that ``the masses began using
cookbooks.'' By the middle of the 18th century, there were 90,000
cookbooks in circulation.
</P>
<P>
   So here's a best-hits list of the cookbooks that, in retrospect,
define the tastes of Western civilization through the Middle Ages:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Yale Culinary Texts: circa 1700 B.C., Mesopotamian
civilization. Three tablets listing recipes in the Ancient Near
East language of Akkadian. The best preserved, Tablet A, lists the
preparations for 25 stews in laconic cook's shorthand. The most
elaborate recipe, on Tablet B, details the preparation of a
double-crust poultry pie, from eviscerating the birds to assembling
the dish and serving.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Writings of Mithekos of Syracuse: circa 400 B.C., Greek
civilization. This ancient author lived in southern Italy and
composed a culinary anthology. Though his writings have been
referred to in other texts, they've never been found.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  De Re Coquinaria (On Culinary Art): circa 400 A.D., Roman
civilization. The collected writings of Apicius, who actually lived
at the beginning of the common era, but whose works were compiled
four centuries later. These famous recipes, first translated in the
Middle Ages and often since then, show the vast culinary ambitions
of imperial Rome.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Kitab al-Tabikh (The Book of Dishes): circa 1000 A.D., Arab
civilization. Compiled by Ibn Nasr Ibn Sayyar, a writer descended
from aristocracy, this collection of 400 recipes describes the
dishes of kings, caliphs and famous men. It was commissioned by an
unnamed patron for his own use. Among the elaborate dishes are a
fish that is baked, steamed and fried at once. Part of it is
wrapped in an oil-soaked cloth, part wrapped in a steamed cloth and
part left uncovered to bake.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Libre de Sent Sovi: 1324, Catalan. Among the earliest of the
explosion of cookery books in medieval Europe, particularly in
Catalonia. Gives its name to a popular Silicon Valley restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Libre de Coch: 1520, Catalan. Another important work from this
region, ascribed to Ruperto de Nola. With its many Provencal and
Italian recipes, shows the increasingly cosmopolitan nature of
medieval European food.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Manuscrit Ecrit Vers 1300 (Manuscript Written Around 1300):
French. Royal recipes from French and Italian courts; documents the
kind of late medieval dishes prepared through the Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Le Grand Cuisinier des Toutes Cuisines: 14th century, French:
This book was written in the 14th century, but published in the
16th century after the advent of the printing press. Says food
historian Charles Perry, ``People bought this book expecting to
cook from it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Forme of Cury: 14th century, English. The first cookbook
in English.
</P>
<P>
   And what's the best-selling cookbook in the world today?
Presumably the best-selling cookbook in America: ``The Low-Carb
Cookbook'' by Fran McCullough (Hyperion).

 &HT;    3,700 years ago, cooks gave birth to the earliest recipes, a
test-of-time concept that's written in stone
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The recipe for vegetable stew is written in the kind of ``just
between us cooks'' shorthand that brims with tantalizing
possibility:
</P>
<P>
   ``There must be meat from a leg of lamb. Prepare the water. Add
... salt, beer, onions, spiny herbs, coriander, samidu, cumin and
beets to throw into the pot. Then crush garlic and leeks and add
them. Let the whole cook into a stew, onto which you sprinkle
coriander.''
</P>
<P>
   Nouvelle borscht?
</P>
<P>
   Nouvelle nothing. This recipe comes from the world's oldest
known cookbook, one of three clay tablets at the Babylonian
Collection of Yale University Library in New Haven, Conn., that
paint a vivid picture of haute cuisine in ancient Mesopotamia.
</P>
<P>
   It was a cuisine that sounds at once strangely modern and, well,
just plain strange. So what was it? It was a savory potpie but also
pickled grasshoppers en brochette. It was crushed garlic squeezed
through a cloth to extract its sweet essence, but also the tail of
a goat singed over a flame to burn off its fur.
</P>
<P>
   It was an experienced voice instructing the reader to peel
gizzards for gravy and to make sure flattened pie dough hangs no
more than ``four fingers'' over the edge of the pan before baking.
It was a cautious voice, as well, urging care when washing and
drying a cleaned game bird and warning that a little raw onion goes
a long way. But if this all starts to sound warm and fuzzy, like
some ancient Near East answer to Martha Stewart Living, just
consider a recipe for goat stew made with sour milk and blood. And
that singed tail.
</P>
<P>
   This was, after all, 1700 B.C. As Jean Bottero, the French
philologist who translated these texts, remarked when contacted at
his home near Paris, ``I wouldn't make one of these recipes for my
worst enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   So why, if Mesopotamian cuisine fails the taste test of time,
should we care? Because these ancient recipes show, in fascinating
detail, that gourmets have been galloping since the beginning of
recorded history. Because they evidently lay the foundation for the
cuisines of the modern Mediterranean. And because, despite
Bottero's warning, they seem to leap from the text after all these
years and ask to be tried. One more thing: If ever there's a time
to serve dishes from the world's first cookbook, next month's
millennial party is it.
</P>
<P>
   We know from the great number of texts and artworks that remain
from the era that ancient Babylonians had already assembled the
essentials of the Mediterranean diet _ figs, grapes and
pomegranates; leeks, cucumbers and mushrooms; beef, lamb and fowl;
fish and shellfish; leavened and unleavened bread; milk and honey;
olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, says Ulla Kasten, museum editor of the Babylonian
Collection at Yale, no one had any idea how these raw foodstuffs
were assembled until Bottero (a well-known French gourmet as well
as a linguist) translated the three tablets in 1985. ``We couldn't
read them. There was a lot of `take this and take that' so we
assumed they were pharmaceutical texts.''
</P>
<P>
   They were, in fact, tersely worded recipes: not what we know
from popular cookbooks, with measurements and times, but rather, as
Bottero says, ``like a cookbook written for professional chefs in
our own era, like the `Guide Culinaire' by Auguste Escoffier.''
Take this, take that, voila.
</P>
<P>
   Their importance to culinary history cannot be overstated,
particularly when you look at the gap that follows. There are no
extant culinary texts from the Hebrew, Egyptian or Greek
civilizations, and, chronologically, the next written recipes known
to mankind are the writings of the Roman Apicius, compiled in the
4th century A.D., two millennia later.
</P>
<P>
   The best preserved of the three Yale texts, called Tablet A,
offers a wealth of information on a hand-held rectangle of clay. No
larger than a Palm Pilot, it packs 75 lines of cuneiform writing
that detail 25 recipes for stew. All are made with water and some
kind of enriching fat, and all simmer for a long time in a covered
pot.
</P>
<P>
   The basic ``Meat Stew,'' while not Dinty Moore, follows a
technique that anyone with Revereware would recognize:
</P>
<P>
   ``Take some meat. Prepare water, throw fat into it, then add
(break in the text), leeks and garlic, all crushed together and
some plain suhutinnu (most likely an aromatic herb).''
</P>
<P>
   Other recipes specify certain kinds of meat _ lamb, mutton,
squab, a bird called tarru _ and show more refinement in the
seasoning. Birds are simmered in giblet gravy enriched with milk.
Dried herbs are added at the beginning of the cooking time, fresh
leafy herbs added toward the end. Simmered large fowl are imbued
with aromatic vegetables and shiqqu (a fermented fish sauce similar
to Thai nam pla), then ``presented for carving.''
</P>
<P>
   The most detailed recipe, though, comes from Tablet B and shows
the culture's preoccupation with the culinary arts. This elaborate
potpie takes the cook through every step, from cleaning the whole
birds, to preparing a gravy with giblets, milk, dried herbs and
aromatic vegetables, to preparing the dough while the stock
simmers.
</P>
<P>
   The dough is divided and the bottom crust baked.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the top crust is flavored with mint and also baked
separately in a domed vessel.
</P>
<P>
   The cooked birds, their giblet gravy and small rolls are
arranged in the bottom crust.
</P>
<P>
   When the top crust is carefully upended over the the bottom
crust, ``you ... send everything to the table.'' Whew.
</P>
<P>
   (This recipe, in fact, follows precisely the same procedure as
one in a popular modern cookbook. In Shirley O. Corriher's
``CookWise,'' the Atlanta food scientist assembles an apple pie
with a filling prepared on a stovetop and two prebaked crusts, the
top one cooked inside a metal mixing bowl.)
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, this elaborate preparation was not everyday food. They
may have been prepared for royal banquets, elaborate business
dinners or, says Kasten, ``fed'' to statues of gods. ``Food would
be set in front of the statues and they would miraculously get
eaten.'' In fact, the temple priests ate quite well.
</P>
<P>
   Bottero suggests that the tablets may have been ritual dishes or
may simply exist to ``keep the memory of a particularly good
recipe.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Bottero repeatedly dissuades would-be recipe
developers from thinking they can achieve any kind of authenticity.
``A recipe may call for a dairy product,'' he says, ``but that's
all we know. Perhaps it's a cheese, but would it be a fromage blanc
(a mild cream cheese) or an Alsatian Muenster (a cheese as
notoriously pungent as Limburger)? That would made a difference!''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, historians haven't been able to identify all the species
of birds, fish and herbs. There are many words for onion (and
recipes that call for several kinds of onion used together), but
researchers can only guess whether these resemble our modern leeks,
garlic and shallots, or whether they are cultivars that have become
extinct.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't stop people from trying. Charles Perry, an
intrepid L.A. food historian and food writer, has attempted to
reproduce recipes from thoughout the Middle Ages and antiquity. But
when he turned his sights to the so-called ``nouvelle borscht''
from Tablet A that begins this article, he ran up against
particular problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of these recipes has one ingredient we don't know,''
says Perry, whose attempts at reproduction always begin with
scholarly research. ``Beets weren't grown for their roots back
then, so I needed a vegetable more like Swiss chard. The beer in
those days didn't use hops, so I substituted malt syrup.''
</P>
<P>
   And how was the finished product? ``It was kind of weird,''
Perry avers.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford A. Wright, whose just published ``Mediterranean Feast''
(Morrow) presents a sweeping look at the medieval cookery of that
region, doesn't believe it's possible to capture an ancient flavor
from a book.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't understand the mentality of the cook, and we
certainly don't understand the extraordinary passions of the
medieval people,'' says Wright, who prefers to document the history
within modern recipes rather than cook from the source.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Wright contends that the development of a cookbook _ such as
these three remarkable texts from Babylonia _ is a hallmark of
civilization. ``Writing down a recipe is a self-conscious act on
the part of the culture to represent itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turning raw food into cooked food,'' he adds, ``is one thing.
But turning raw food into cuisine is another matter entirely.''

 &HT;    Recipes how old? Can you say `stone tablet'?
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Culinary historians are split into two camps when the question
of cooking from historical texts arises. Colman Andrews, editor of
the anthropologically minded Saveur Magazine, admits that ``most of
it isn't things we'd want to eat today.'' But he offers the best
advice for cooks who are tempted to try. ``Perhaps we don't have
anything practical to learn, but I'm a big fan of impractical
knowledge. It shapes and enriches our practical knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   With that advice in mind, we offer ``re-creations'' of four
historical recipes, each prepared within a sliding scale of
orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   VEGETABLE
</P>
<P>
   Braised Turnips From Ancient Mesopotamia
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   This recipe has been developed from one of the four vegetable
stews listed on Tablet A in the Yale collection. It is typically
terse:
</P>
<P>
   ``Meat is not needed. Boil water. Throw fat in. Add onion,
spiney herb (name unknown), coriander, cumin and kanasu (a legume).
Squeeze leek and garlic and spread juice on dish. Add onion and
mint.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean Bottero, the eminent translator of this recipe, notes this
is the only one of the vegetable stews that doesn't use some meat,
perhaps leftovers, as a flavoring. Whether or not it's truly
vegetarian is another matter. The fat may have been linseed or
olive oil or even butter but was mostly likely animal fat, as
described in other recipes, picked with the fingers to remove any
bits of ``string'' or sinew. I chose to believe it was olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   In order to adapt this recipe, I contacted Mediterranean food
authority Paula Wolfert. She suggested bringing a small amount of
water to a boil with the olive oil, and then covering the dish with
a lid to truly braise the turnips. The technique is typical of
modern Turkish vegetable cookery, says Wolfert. In fact, she has
published a recipe for leeks cooked in precisely this manner, and
finished with lemon juice and parsley.
</P>
<P>
   I also had to make some brash assumptions. For the unknown herb
translated as ``spiny herb'' or ``dorsal thorn'' I chose rosemary;
and for the unknown legume, I went with the obvious choice _
chickpeas.
</P>
<P>
   I can't say an ancient Mesopotamian would recognize this recipe.
But I can assure you a modern American will relish it.
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup water
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds white turnips, peeled and cubed
</P>
<P>
   1 small onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 small branch rosemary
</P>
<P>
   1 (14.5-ounce) can chickpeas, drained
</P>
<P>
   1 small leek, trimmed and finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 large cloves garlic
</P>
<P>
   2 green onions, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint
</P>
<P>
   Roast the coriander and cumin seeds in a baking dish in a
preheated, 375-degree oven until nicely browned, about 10 minutes.
Grind in a mortar or with a spice grinder. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Bring water, salt and oil to the boil in a 5-quart pot. Add the
peeled turnips, chopped onion, ground spices, rosemary and lima
beans and cover; reduce heat to medium-low. Continue braising until
the turnips are crisp-tender, about 20 minutes. Transfer the
contents of the pot and its juices to a serving bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, pulse the leek and garlic in a food processor until
well-ground. Gather into a clean kitchen towel (or cheesecloth) and
squeeze the juices over the turnips; toss to mix. Sprinkle with
green onions and mint.

<P>
   Kippu Stew
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 40 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 1 hour, 20 minutes, Chilling time: 1 hour
</P>
<P>
   A kippu is a kind of bird, according to Bottero, perhaps a game
bird such as quail, partridge or woodcock. For this adaption of
Kippu stew, I asked Mary Ann Clayton to develop a recipe that
followed the spirit, if not the letter, of the evocative recipes
for stewed poultry from Tablets A and B.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Mary Ann took the best of three recipes. From the Kippu
Stew recipe on Tablet A, she cooked the birds (quail) in a broth
flavored with mint and vinegar. From the recipe on Tablet A called
Stew With Crumbs, she took the idea of thickening the broth with
whole grain. And from the elaborate poultry pie recipe on Tablet B,
she re-created the sensation of breaking through a rich, nutty
crust to find a whole bird. ``A lot of flavor,'' was her
assessment.
</P>
<P>
   For the crust:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup whole-wheat flour
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup shortening or butter
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons cold water
</P>
<P>
   For the quail filling:
</P>
<P>
   8 quail
</P>
<P>
   Giblets
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons rice vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon salt
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons minced fresh mint
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons butter, divided
</P>
<P>
   2 leeks (white part only), finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons whole-wheat flour
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   6 cups liquid (broth from birds plus enough water to make 6
cups)
</P>
<P>
   For the crust: In a medium bowl stir together 1/2 cup
whole-wheat flour, 1/2 cup all-purpose flour and 1 teaspoon salt.
Cut in 1/3 cup shortening or butter until the mixture resembles
coarse meal.
</P>
<P>
   Add the cold water and knead dough into a ball. Refrigerate for
at least 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   For the quail: Place quail and giblets in a large pot; add
vinegar and enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and
simmer for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Remove quail and rub gently inside and out with a mixture of 1
tablespoon salt and the mint. Place in a casserole dish. Finely
chop the giblets and add to the casserole. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet and cook the leeks and
garlic until translucent. Sprinkle the leeks and garlic over the
quail in the casserole. Add 2 tablespoons butter to the skillet and
sprinkle with whole-wheat and all-purpose flours. Cook and stir
until the flour is lightly browned. Slowly whisk in the liquid and
continue cooking until the sauce is thickened, about 10 minutes.
Pour the sauce over the quail in the casserole.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Roll out the crust into a shape
that fits the casserole. Lay the crust loosely over the quail and
bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until the crust is nicely browned.

   People have been re-creating Apicius' recipes since the 15th
century. Here is British culinary historian Andrew Dalby's take on
this recipe from Apicius 10, 1, 4:
</P>
<P>
   ``Prepare the fish carefully, put in a mortar salt and coriander
seed, crush finely, roll the fish in it, put in a baking dish,
cover, seal, bake in the bread oven. When cooked remove, season
with very sharp vinegar and serve.''
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons coriander seeds
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2 fillets of cod, haddock or another mild white fish
</P>
<P>
   White wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Roast the coriander seeds in a baking dish in a preheated,
375-degree oven until nicely browned, about 10 minutes. Cool
slightly, then pound with the salt in a mortar until you have a
well-broken mixture. Pat the fish fillets dry with paper towels and
remove any small bones. Roll the fillets in the mixture as if it
were bread crumbs, then place them in an oiled casserole and cover
with a lid. Place in the oven and cook for 20-25 minutes. Serve
immediately, sprinkled with vinegar. _ From ``The Classical
Cookbook'' by Andrew Dalby and Sally Grainger (J. Paul Getty Museum
Publishers)

   Clifford A. Wright offers this dish _ rice studded with brown
lentils and topped with crisped onions _ as an example of a modern
Arabic recipe that has its roots in medieval times. The name,
perhaps a joke based on the appearance, literally means ``having
smallpox.'' It is a tasty dish that offers a complete source of
protein.
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, peeled
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dried brown lentils, picked over and rinsed well
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon clarified butter or vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1 small onion, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 cups boiling water
</P>
<P>
   1 cup long-grain rice, rinsed well or soaked in water to cover
for 30 minutes and drained
</P>
<P>
   Halve the onion, then slice from the stem end into very thin
slices, less than 1/16 inch. Arrange the onion slices on some paper
towels, sprinkle generously with salt and leave for 30 minutes
covered with paper towels to absorb moisture.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat
and toss the onions slices until coated with oil. Continue turning
the onion as the slices turn from white to yellow to brown. Once
they turn brown, about 8 to 9 minutes, continue to cook until some
turn dark brown, another 2 minutes. Remove the skillet from the
burner and quickly transfer the onions to a paper towel-lined
platter to cool and drain. Once they are cool, they will have
become crispy.
</P>
<P>
   Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil and cook the
lentils until al dente, 20 minutes to 1 hour. Check the lentils
occasionally so they are not overcooked, since lentil cooking times
differ; they should be ever so slightly hard, not completely soft.
Drain and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   In a large, heavy casserole or saucepan with a tight-fitting
lid, melt the clarified butter over medium-high heat, then cook the
chopped onion until golden, 7 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Pour in the boiling water, 1 teaspoon salt and reserved lentils,
bring to a boil and add drained rice. Return to a boil, reduce heat
to very low, cover and cook until the water is absorbed and the
rice is tender, about 30 minutes. Transfer to a platter and garnish
with the crispy onions on top. _ From ``A Mediterranean Feast'' by
Clifford A. Wright (Morrow)

 &HT;    No matter the name, cake's a hit
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mary Rose fondly remembered a Mandarin Orange Cake
that a co-worker brought to an office party many years ago and
asked for the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Responses that came in were almost identical _ listing yellow
cake mix, mandarin oranges, whipped topping, pineapple and vanilla
pudding as ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   The only variation: the name. Some, including Ann Pass, who sent
this one, called it Pig Pickin' Cake _ presumably because it's so
good you feel like eating it with your fingers as you might pulled
pork barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you call it, this cake is attractive and easy to make.
The layers are thin, so it bakes quickly. And if you're not a fan
of frozen whipped topping, you can use whipped cream instead.

 &HT;    `Big Daddy' Sandler charms
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Big Daddy'' (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways to look at Adam Sandler. He's either the poor
man's Cary Grant or the white-collar crowd's long-lost fourth
Stooge.
</P>
<P>
   Sandler's latest moneymaker nimbly ties together elements from
his successful date movie ``The Wedding Singer'' (boyish innocence
and charm to woo the women in the audience) and his even more
successful yukfest ``The Waterboy'' (scatological scatting just for
the boys). Throw in an itty-bitty kid for Sandler to pal around
with and you have the makings of a mack-daddy movie.
</P>
<P>
   It's light on its feet and full of jokes that often hit the mark
(especially if you don't set the bar too high). Best of all is
Sandler himself. He's one smooth talker, whether he's connecting
with his pint-size co-star (played by 6-year-old twins Cole and
Dylan Sprouse) or cozying up to his latest love interest (Joey
Lauren Adams). Sandler plays Sonny Koufax, a law school grad who's
chosen to spend his life watching cartoons and drooling milk while
snarfing down cereal. It's all the sweet sloth of life until his
girlfriend bolts and little Julian shows up at his door.
</P>
<P>
   Sandler's character ends up as the tyke's caretaker _ and the
comedy kicks into high gear. When a scared Julian wets the bed,
Sonny's answer is to lay a few newspapers over the sheets. When the
kid can't sleep without a night light, Sonny hooks one up: a neon
sign that reads ``Live Nudes.'' He teaches Julian how to properly
fold a pizza slice before devouring it, how to master wrestling's
sleeper hold, how to urinate in public. It would be criminal if it
wasn't all put together to be so darned cute. The movie is priced
to buy: $21.95 VHS, $24.95 DVD.

 &HT;    Eurythmics revisit sweet dreams
 &HT;    By Shane Harrison
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dave Stewart and Annie Lennox were responsible for some of the
brightest moments of '80s pop with shimmering gems such as ``Here
Comes the Rain Again'' and ``Who's That Girl?'' After a successful,
if not particularly prolific solo career, Lennox reteams with
Stewart for the duo's first new album in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Lennox and Stewart sound 10 years older, too. There's certainly
nothing wrong with that. The adjective ``adult,'' as in adult
contemporary or adult alternative, often springs to mind. This is
grown-up music, pleasant and quietly diverting. It almost
</P>
<P>
   rocks in spots but never loudly enough to distract from the
</P>
<P>
   maturity of it all.
</P>
<P>
   That older and wiser feel extends to the lyrics. The reflective
``17 Again'' even includes a reference to the pair's first major
U.S. hit, ``Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This),'' with an added dose
of world-weariness: ``Sweet dreams are made of anything that gets
you in the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   The most important element of the Eurythmics' sound remains.
Lennox's voice is dark and rich like caramel, making everything it
touches a little sweeter. She could sing a transcription of the
Gore/Bradley debate and make it sound interesting. Fortunately, the
material she tackles here is of a higher caliber than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace''
</P>
<P>
   Eurythmics. Arista. 11 tracks.

 &HT;    It's almost deja vu as Young returns to CSN fold
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marketing angles aside, it's hard to think of many Neil Young
fans who really cared
</P>
<P>
   if he ever reunited with onetime 1970s supergroup compadres
David Crosby, Graham Nash and Stephen Stills. The peace-and-love
harmonies of C, S &AMP; N always sounded better with cranky old Y
sitting in, but the trio never transcended its own hippie
nostalgia: the very stuff Young's resurgent '90s solo career was
built on blowing to smithereens (if, often, with a sentimental
sigh). Neil parties with Pearl Jam. Crosby's just happy to be
alive. There's a definite rock 'n' roll credibility gap here.
</P>
<P>
   But for their first recording together since 1989's ``American
Dream,'' the foursome can be surprisingly lively. If there's a
wistful, weathered tone to much of the material, the singers
certainly come by it honestly, and when the dust kicks up, as it
does on Stills' simmering ``No Tears Left,'' there's a palpable
sense of rage against dying light. (``I ain't done yet,'' the
guitarist promises). On the other hand, Crosby's ``Dream for Him,''
apparently written with a child in mind, is clumsy and tuneless,
and on tracks like ``Sanibel,'' the group sounds as if it's
auditioning to join the next Jimmy Buffett tour.
</P>
<P>
   Between Stills' fevered guitar playing and several of Young's
idiosyncratic contributions, ``Looking Forward'' is justified as
something more than a warm-up for the group's reunion tour, which
begins early next year. But it's a close call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking
</P>
<P>
   Forward''
</P>
<P>
   Crosby, Stills, Nash &AMP; Young. Reprise.
</P>
<P>
   12 tracks.

 &HT;    Mini CD reviews
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton, Sonia Murray and Kathy Janich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  ROCK
</P>
<P>
   ``This Desert Life''
</P>
<P>
   Counting Crows. DGC. 10 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Give Counting Crows credit _ the group fights the good fight. At
a time when pop music is becoming increasingly synthetic and
mechanized, these six California bohemians bravely man the
battlements of organic rock. The Crows' third release is rife with
such ``real'' instruments as 12-string guitar, Hammond B-3 organ,
pedal steel guitar, mandolin and electric piano. These are potent
weapons, if only the group knew how to wield them better. Where
``This Desert Life'' falters is in the songwriting. Memorable tunes
are precious and few _ only ``hanginaround,'' the opener, and ``All
My Friends'' stand out from the midtempo, roots-rock pack. A few
songs are downright annoying. ``Mrs. Potter's Lullaby'' takes a
tired theme _ how weird and sad Los Angeles is _ and drags it out
for almost eight minutes, with vocalist Adam Duritz droning on in
his patented whine all the while. Time for a new battle plan.
</P>
<P>
   _Doug Hamilton
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  RAP
</P>
<P>
   ``Black on Both Sides''
</P>
<P>
   Mos Def. Rawkus. 17 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   So far, this is the best rap album of the year. Dr. Dre, Goodie
Mob and the solo release from Q-Tip of thinking-man rap act A Tribe
Called Quest are still to come. But the hip-hop world would be all
right for a good while if it only had this to hold up to naysayers
of the genre's lyrical and musical strength and critics discontent
with its prominent slant toward the material. Accessible even in
its high-minded-ness, ``Black on Both Sides'' moves with
intelligence and engrossing rhythms from a possible manifesto for
Mos Def's peers (``Fear Not of Man'') to why filmmaker Woody Allen
doesn't face the same public scorn that football's O.J. Simpson
does (``Mr. (Expletive)''). And it's hopeful spirit resounds in a
place far more meaningful than a dance floor long after the CD
stops.

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SOUNDTRACK
</P>
<P>
   ``Annie''
</P>
<P>
   Television cast. Disney. 17 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   There always seems to be another tomorrow for ``Annie,'' the
musical about that never-say-die redhead. And this Disney version
sounds as bouncy as an orphan high on sugar. It should sound good
with its cast of big Broadway names _ four-time Tony Award nominee
Victor Garber as Warbucks; triple Tony winner Audra McDonald as his
secretary; and Tony winners Alan Cumming and Kristin Chenoweth as
Rooster and Lily. Alicia Morton doesn't have the pipes that the
original Annie, Andrea McArdle, did (listen for McArdle's cameo on
``NYC''), but she does OK for a 12-year-old on whom big bucks are
riding. The delight here is Cumming, who in one song (``Easy
Street''), plays Rooster as a wicked, wily, oily, blockheaded and
endearing scamp.
</P>

   ``Annie'' airs at 7 p.m. Sunday on ABC.

   CIR-VICHIP (Undated) _ With Kenny dying a violent death at the
end of every ``South Park'' episode, wrestlers on cable channels
engaging in round-the-clock head banging, and plenty of bare skin
in prime time, it is not surprising that many parents find a lot of
what is on television unfit for their children. But when offered
something that would block violent or racy shows from their
television set's, would parents actually use it? It seems not, if
the arrival of the V-chip is any indication. The V-chip, circuitry
that can be used to block programs according to a ratings system,
quickly gained the support of Congress and parents' groups in the
mid 1990s. By January, all sets over 13 inches sold in the United
States will be required to have one. But whether it is because of a
lack of consumer awareness, or because it is difficult to use or
because parents do not feel they need it, the V-chip has few users,
judging by interviews with retailers, industry experts and
consumers. Even groups that support the V-chip acknowledge that it
has yet to catch on with the public. By Catherine Greenman.

   BUILDING-SUPER (New York) _ James Healey owns three computers, a
constantly ringing cellular telephone and oversees 33 employees.
His workday starts at 7 a.m. sharp, firing off e-mail messages to
staff, clients and board members. Sounds like a typical executive
climbing the corporate ladder, but in this case the corporation is
the San Remo apartment building on Central Park West, and the
ladder that Healey is climbing leads not a corner office but to a
suite _ where he works as the building's superintendent. Sorry,

   NY-LOFT (New York) _ Over 25 years of marriage, Steven and

in Athens where they lived shortly after the collapse of the
Papadopoulos regime. Then there was the cedar-paneled house
overlooking a sound in Bermuda, the tile-roofed hacienda in Phoenix
and the suburban rendition of a Provencal manor in Dobbs Ferry,
N.Y. Finally, just a loud honk from the Holland Tunnel, they're
putting down roots. But for the first time, the couple say, they're
in terra incognita, in a territory mapped by architects. Where once
they traveled freely with little more than what they could stow
under an airplane seat, now their roots are planted in blue
Brazilian granite, laminated glass and blackened steel plate. By

   RETHINKING-KITCHENS (Providence, R.I.) _ The kitchen of the past
was designed for one sex: female, whether hired cook or lady of the
house. Social changes, however, have ensured that today everyone is
in the kitchen, and happy to be: teenagers, children, men, the
elderly and, yes, women. So, what's wrong with that? The kitchen,
says Jane Langmuir, an architect. It hasn't caught up. ``We get
coded at a very early age by memories of the place we grew up in,
and think, `Why change it?''' Ms. Langmuir said. ``But that kitchen
was designed for a single person, 5-foot-6. And when you start
putting everyone else in, it's not going to work very well.'' By

EVERYONE LOSES WHEN ONLY THE RUTHLESS SURVIVE NEW GAME SHOWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We enter a special kind of purgatory Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greed'' arrives on Fox, choking game-show rules senseless with
a sacrificial offering of more: More cash and more drama rewarded
for more smarts, more shrewdness, more acts of underlying deceit,
back-scratching, back-breaking, backstabbing.
</P>
<P>
   All for more ratings, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Surely you've heard how ``Greed'' works. Teams duel by answering
survey questions, but it's not about teamwork. Top prize is $2
million, but one person could walk away with every penny.
</P>
<P>
   How opportunistic.
</P>
<P>
   How shrewd.
</P>
<P>
   How American.
</P>
<P>
   Developed by Dick Clark Productions and hosted by Chuck Woolery,
we should have seen this coming the moment ABC's ``Who Wants to Be
a Millionaire'' hammered competitors during a two-week summer stint
and immediately announced that it would return to the scene of the
pillage. (That happens Sunday, during the network sweeps ratings
period, when it really counts.)
</P>
<P>
   But good TV things rarely come from frantic ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greed'' is loosely modeled after the long-running ``Family
Feud,'' the touchy-feely game show where two teams squared off in a
fast-paced question-answer setting, often huddling to come up with
the best possible answer.
</P>
<P>
   In this warped version, members of five-person teams are
encouraged to literally turn on each other midway through the
match, leaving one person to play for the $2 million purse.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't a better title be ``Watch Your Back''?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all tongue-in-cheek,'' confesses Mike Darnell,
``Greed's'' executive producer. No wonder he laughs while uttering
this, attaching humor to a title that comes with less-than-positive
connotations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really just a fun game show for viewers wanting to watch
people like themselves answer questions, putting themselves in that
position at home. It's about being in a competitive environment.
It's quite harmless, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, like CBS' ``Survivor!,'' where social skills, hunting
talent, and a strong sense of self could net you $1 million. If you
survive the psychological torture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' is the ``game show'' where 16 people are deposited
on an island for up to 40 days and asked to cooperate in locating
food, shelter and cable. The twist: Every three days, the group
votes to send one member packing _ while the cameras record
everything.
</P>
<P>
   When down to two, the group picks one.
</P>
<P>
   The last one standing gets the cash. Everyone else gets vacation
memories.
</P>
<P>
   What we'll see is the edited version of all this, run over 13
hourlong episodes.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``The Real World'' with a lucrative door prize and a
``motive'' to be pathologically devious.
</P>
<P>
   Creators of ``Survivor!'' call their ``game'' a series of
physically grueling competitions, but the whole thing is really a
test of mental endurance.
</P>
<P>
   Contestants are asked to help each other out, all the while
knowing that the end result is seeing others disappear first.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Greed,'' ``Survivor!'' is based on the notion that we're
a society made up of individuals, that we need to take care of
ourselves. Let the weak scramble for leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   Help others only to help yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like ``Greed.'' As the game wears on and questions become
more difficult, team members can challenge their own teammates,
moving ahead by basically keeping them down. Sounds like any
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Darnell calls it the American way, and how can we argue with the
logic of free enterprise and market value in a world where you can
choke your boss and be rewarded, as long as you deliver the goods
and sell sneakers?
</P>
<P>
   With every network racing to resurrect game shows or invent new
ones, let's hope they all crash and burn.
</P>
<P>
   Or that when Michael Davies, executive producer of
``Millionaire,'' promises that ``only good programs work,'' it's
not merely a tease. ``Just because `Millionaire' works, just
because people go out and produce lousy game shows, doesn't mean
they will work,'' Davies says.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope so.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even if you don't see signs of a roof leak in the rooms below
the attic, it's a good idea to make a yearly inspection of the roof
from inside the attic itself. It is possible that you have a roof
leak, but the water may be collecting in the attic insulation or
running into unseen areas like the wall cavities. The best time to
make a leak inspection is during, or immediately after, a
rainstorm.
</P>
<P>
   Many attics were designed for storage and insulation, not
walking around. If your attic has exposed joists without a
subfloor, slide a couple of 2 by 6's across the floor framing so
you can walk or crawl without having to worry about falling through
the ceiling below. Wear a long-sleeved shirt, long pants and a dust
mask, and bring a powerful flashlight.
</P>
<P>
   In the attic, look up at the underside of the roof for obvious
signs of leaks like dampness or water stains. Water stains usually
mean that the leak has occurred in the past. Dampness means that
the spot is still leaking. Start your inspection by looking at
common trouble spots like around the chimney and soil stack, near
the eaves or under the valleys in the roof surface. After looking
at these spots, inspect the entire ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   The chimney is a recurring source of leaks because the masonry
and roof surfaces expand and contract at different rates with
fluctuations in temperature. Gaps frequently open up as the
surfaces pull away from each other. Builders try to prevent this by
installing flashing, thin sheets of flexible metal, between the
roof and chimney. If the flashing is correctly installed, it should
come up the sides of the chimney and fold into the mortar joints
between the chimney bricks.
</P>
<P>
   Flashing leaks occur around the chimney if the flashing
deteriorates or if the top edge was not correctly inserted into the
mortar joints. For a short- term fix, you can inject a high-grade
urethane roof sealant into the gaps around the chimney. Over time,
however, the gaps will open up again and the roof will leak again.
For a permanent fix, replace the flashing.
</P>
<P>
   The backside of the chimney, nearest the roof peak, is
especially vulnerable to water penetration because it forms a
pocket where leaves and debris can collect and retain moisture. To
prevent this, most builders install a saddle (also called a
cricket). The saddle, a small structure that looks like a miniature
peaked roof, prevents debris and moisture accumulation behind the
chimney. If you have a chimney that is more than two feet wide, it
should have a saddle.
</P>
<P>
   Soil stacks and valleys have metal flashing and roofing cement
to make them watertight. If the flashing or the roofing cement
deteriorates, gaps open up that allow water to leak into the attic.
If the cement around the flashing has deteriorated, it should be
removed and replaced with new roof sealant. Damaged vent flashing
should be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   To check for leaks under the eaves, look carefully at the
underside of the roof and the rafters for water stains. Also
examine the insulation directly below the eaves. Fiberglass
insulation that has been soaked with roof water will be matted and
stained. Cellulose insulation will compact into shallow
depressions.
</P>
<P>
   Most eave leaks are not caused by holes or by deterioration of
the roof covering. Instead, they are the result of winter ice dams
that allow roof water to collect and seep under the shingles. In
most cases improving attic ventilation can eliminate them.
</P>
<P>
   In a few rare cases, you may find leaks that do not come through
the roof but are caused within the attic. Condensation is the
leading culprit here. If you have an air-conditioning duct or a
cold-water pipe running through the attic, the external surface
could be cold enough to condense the ambient humidity into water.
The best way to eliminate the problem is by wrapping the pipe or
duct with insulation.
</P>
<P>
   Inspecting the underside of the roof can be done from inside the
attic. Roof repairs, however, must be done outside. Working on a
high roof can be dangerous, so don't take any chances. Do not work
on a roof that has a steep pitch or slippery covering like slate or
tile. Wait for a warm, dry day with little or no wind before
attempting to climb on the roof. Be sure to wear shoes with nonslip
soles. Do not climb on the roof if it is wet. Use a sturdy ladder
that is long enough to extend at least three feet above the edge of
the roof, and anchor the legs so they don't slip.

   Hold That Lopper
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have large butterfly bushes in my yard that attracted
record numbers of butterflies and hummingbirds this summer. I know
they need to be cut back very hard in the spring, but I was
wondering if there is any reason it should not be done now. I would
like to tidy up for the winter.
</P>
<P>
   A. Why would you want to look at a row of stumps? Butterfly bush
is semi-evergreen, holding on to its foliage well into winter.
Besides, tidy for the winter may mean disappointment in the spring.
In areas like the Northeast, butterfly bush (selections of Buddleia
davidii) is frequently the victim of winter, and its stems can
suffer significant dieback. If pruned hard in the fall, dieback
occurs close to the plant's crown, and you may lose the plant. That
would leave a hole in your garden, and a lot of swallowtails would
be scratching their heads, wondering where their next meal was
coming from.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting back in early spring, just as the leaf buds are
beginning to swell, gives you the option of cutting your buddleias
back to 12 to 18 inches above the soil or just above the highest
surviving buds, giving you a taller shrub more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Fall cleanup brings extra energy to gardeners, and the urge to
whack everything down is strong. Whether it's a desire for a neat
closure to the growing year, or revenge after a season of limited
success taming nature, be selective. Other plants that shouldn't be
cut back until early spring include Artemisia Powis Castle,
caryopteris, perovskia, lavender, santolina, Montauk daisy and
candytuft.
</P>
<P>
   What Makes a Fall
</P>
<P>
   Q. All summer I heard that the drought was going to ruin the
fall color display in the Northeast, but this autumn was as
beautiful as any. Since the drought didn't affect the colors, why
was there such a dire prediction? What exactly determines the
quality of a tree's display?  &QL; 
A. The most beautiful autumn displays, the ones that cause a sharp
intake of breath when rounding a bend on a New England back road,
happen when we are very young or very old, the times when we are
most observant and most willing to be thrilled. In the years
between, the quality of displays is up or down, with the credit or
blame going to the vagaries of weather.
</P>
<P>
   True, summer droughts cause many problems, but the weather that
matters for fall color is the weather of the moment. The perfect
display is a balancing act between having enough rainfall just as
autumn begins, and temperature and sunlight during the period when
lengthening nights initiate the process that gradually closes off
the leaf petiole. Cool temperatures reduce chlorophyll production,
and as it breaks down, the yellows and oranges of other chemicals
show through. No matter what you've heard about a certain Jack,
frost is not essential for color; in fact, it is actually a
problem. Freezing temperatures produce muted colors and can kill
leaves. Bright, sunny days encourage the production of red
chemicals in some trees. But the most important ingredient for a
perfect display is a 4-year-old on her first trip north.

<P>
   Q. When you buy something online, how do they make sure credit
card information is safe from computer hackers?
</P>
<P>
   A. Web sites that do electronic commerce usually use data
encryption methods to ensure the safety of your financial
information. When you type in your credit card number and hit the
button to submit it to the company, the information is encrypted
for travel across the Internet. Even if the number is intercepted,
it will be scrambled and useless to most people. The site you were
doing business with can decrypt the information with a special
password once it arrives.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few ways to tell if a site is using a data
encryption scheme. Many will post security notices on the home
page, and your Web browser will often give you an alert message
when you are entering a secure part of the site that is set up to
protect your privacy. You may also notice that the URL of the page
you are on begins with ``https://'' instead of the regular
``http://'' prefix. The ``s'' indicates that the site is using the
Secure Sockets Layer protocol to encrypt your data.
</P>
<P>
   You may want to make sure your Web browsing software supports
encryption _ most current ones do. Some browsers will display an
icon of a closed padlock at the bottom of the window to indicate
that the page is secure, and clicking on the lock will give you
security information.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, many people are nervous about submitting their credit
card numbers to Web sites that encrypt them, but they have no fear
of reading the numbers to strangers over the phone or faxing them
to unknown places. But avoid any business that asks you to send
your credit-card number via e-mail _ that is not a secure method of
payment.

COMPUTER AS POST OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was getting along fine at the post office until digital stamps
came along.
</P>
<P>
   The folks who work at my local post office are cheerful enough,
and you see all kinds of interesting people waiting to buy stamps.
And I happen to enjoy the ``Most Wanted'' pictures.
</P>
<P>
   But I know that many people resent the time spent getting to the
post office and standing in line. And, what with the Internet and
electronic mail and a welter of e-mail programs like Eudora, things
were bound to change.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year the Postal Service approved a plan to sell
postage over the Internet, so people do not have to go to the post
office if they do not want to. They can buy digital postage on
line, and print the stamps _ technically known as ``Information
Based Indicia'' _ onto envelopes, labels and letters right on their
desktops, using a laser or an ink-jet printer.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service is being very cautious about allowing people
to buy and print postage over the Internet, and rightly so, because
printing stamps, er, indicia, is very much like printing money.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the same technologies that enable people to print
indicia at home will also be used some day to print airline and
theater tickets, coupons and other valuable paper chits. But that's
another story.
</P>
<P>
   The two leading providers of computer-generated postage are both
in California, the E-Stamp Corp. of San Mateo (www.e-stamp.com) and
Stamps.com of Santa Monica (www.stamps.com). Other contenders
include Neopost, a European entry, and Pitney Bowes, which
dominates the postage meter market.
</P>
<P>
   These companies all buy postage from the Postal Service at face
value. They make their money by tacking on a service fee, which is
sometimes _ incongruously, as it turns out _ called a convenience
fee.
</P>
<P>
   After using E-Stamp and Stamps.com for a while, I have a new
appreciation for the technical elegance and convenience of
lick-and-stick stamps, circa 1847.
</P>
<P>
   In general, neither of the new Internet-based postal services
turns out to be really practical for sending Christmas cards,
monthly bills or batches of post cards, unless you really, really
hate going to the post office, or really, really love computers.
</P>
<P>
   Stamps.com and E-Stamp are most useful for Internet-connected
small offices and home offices that send a lot of letters and
packages but until now have not been able to justify the cost or
bother of a postage meter. Postage meters have to be rented for $20
or more a month, plus the cost of postage, plus special maintenance
contracts, plus special inks, and some of them still require a
periodic trip to the post office.
</P>
<P>
   Pitney Bowes developed the mechanical postage meter in 1920,
which was the most recent significant change in the way postage was
sold. Until Internet postage came along this year. But the company
was slow to recognize the possibilities of Internet postage, and by
the time it did E-Stamp and Stamps.com had a commanding head start.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the American tradition, Pitney Bowes rolled up its
sleeves and sued its Internet challengers, asserting that they were
violating postage meter patents. The lawsuit has yet to be
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, both E-Stamp and Stamps.com were recently given
permission by the government to offer their services nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   E-Stamp and Stamps.com arrive at the same destination by very
different routes. Neither gets my unqualified indicium of approval,
because both are inconvenient in some ways. Even so, I found one of
them to be much less inconvenient than the other. And the winner is
_ the envelope, please _ Stamps.com.
</P>
<P>
   If E-Stamp did not make such a big deal about offering
``impeccable'' service and support, one might assume that the
company had willingly enlisted the government's own elite
inconvenience engineers to design the product. Chief among the
annoyances, besides software that hung up and crashed frequently on
my computer, are the requirements to attach a special hardware
device to the computer's parallel port and to have a special Postal
Service CD in the CD-ROM drive when postage is printed.
</P>
<P>
   The hardware device, technically called a ``stupid dongle,''
acts like a digital vault in which one's digital postage is stored
after it is bought on the Internet. (Another annoyance is that, as
of early this week, the only way to buy postage for E-Stamp was by
bank draft.) Storing the postage in the digital vault allows the
user to print postage at any time, without needing to connect again
to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But if the stupid dongle starts spitting out warning messages at
10 p.m., as mine did recently, telling me to contact technical
support immediately for unspecified reasons, the perverse
cleverness of the inefficiency engineers becomes evident. E-Stamp
offers technical support only from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Pacific
Standard Time. (Whatever problem there was with my stupid dongle
apparently vanished as spontaneously as it appeared.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The E-Stamp software, the special CD and the dongle come in a
retail package that costs $50. The actual cost is $25, because $25
worth of postage credits is included.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that with Stamps.com, which allows postage to be
purchased by credit card, requires no special dongle, does not tie
up the CD-ROM drive, and offers not only round-the-clock telephone
technical support, but also interactive, one-on-one text chats with
technicians even in the wee hours.
</P>
<P>
   The drawback to Stamps.com is that it requires the user to
download a hefty (but free) software package and then to connect to
the Internet whenever the need or urge comes to print postage.
</P>
<P>
   The postage is stored on line. This is no problem for those with
network connections that are always on, which are common in offices
or in households lucky enough to have cable or digital subscriber
line Internet service. For people who dial into the Internet with a
standard modem, especially over a phone line that is shared for
voice or fax calls, that is a major drawback.
</P>
<P>
   Stamps.com has a monthly subscription fee and requires the user
to choose one of three plans. The personal plan costs $1.99 a month
on top of the face-value cost of the postage up to $25. A 15
percent service fee is assessed on the amount of postage bought
that exceeds $25 a month, up to a maximum fee of $19.99.
</P>
<P>
   A variation on the personal plan replaces the $1.99 monthly
service fee with a single, yearly fee of $19.99, with the same
surcharge for purchases that are more than $25 a month. Finally,
there is a business plan for people who pay $40 or more for postage
each month. The fee is 10 percent of the cost of all postage
bought, with a minimum monthly fee of $3.99 and a maximum of
$19.99.
</P>
<P>
   E-Stamp's fees are simpler, just 10 percent over the value of
the postage, with a minimum fee of $4.99 and a maximum of $24.99 a
month, no matter how much postage is used. But if you buy only $10
in postage a month, the $4.99 convenience fee is disproportionately
steep.
</P>
<P>
   Both programs can draw recipients' names and addresses from
contact management programs like Symantec's ACT!, Microsoft
Outlook, or from popular word-processing programs like Corel
WordPerfect or Microsoft Word. But E-Stamp works with more programs
and peripherals, including Intuit's popular Quick books accounting
package for small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Another important thing: Conventional stamps are anonymous,
while Information Based Indicia, as the name suggests, store even
more unique information about you than do your fingerprints. Both
E-Stamp and Stamps.com require the user to apply to the government
for a postal license, a simple process that can take anywhere from
a few minutes to 24 hours, but forfeits anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Every indicia is unique, and its two-dimensional bar code
includes information about the sender (including bank or credit
card information), the recipient, and the time and date the stamp
is created. The Postal Service can demand to see a list of all
stamps printed by any user of the service, and thus can track all
mail sent. Letters with indicia must by regulation be mailed within
24 hours, so one cannot print postage in advance for use later.
</P>
<P>
   It comes down to this: If you have a dedicated line to the
Internet, Stamps.com gets the edge. If you connect to the Net
through a regular modem and dial-up connection, and don't mind the
hassles of the dongle and CD, E-Stamp's off-line system is the way
to go.
</P>
<P>
   More information on the Internet postage is available at
www.usps.gov/ibip/.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, postal letters affixed with indicia still
travel at a snail's pace compared with e-mail, and they jeopardize
the privacy not only of the sender but also of the recipient.
E-mail is less elegant than a simple, well-crafted letter, but it
is much more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, 99 percent of my written communications these days
travel as bits instead of as atoms, and they do not require stamps
at all.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hundreds of people who were among the first to order the new
handheld Visor, a Palm Pilot-like digital assistant, are still
waiting for the UPS truck.
</P>
<P>
   A few dozen disgruntled customers have congregated at an
independent Web site called visorcentral.com to vent their
frustration. Some have canceled their orders; others are just plain
angry at Visor's maker, Handspring, a flashy Silicon Valley
start-up.
</P>
<P>
   Handspring, well aware of the problems, has posted an apologetic
letter on its Web site, www.handspring.com, and contends that fixes
are under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly not the way we wanted to launch the company,
that's for sure,'' said Donna Dubinsky, Handspring's chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Loftus is typical of the frustrated would-be customers. He
placed a telephone order for the much-anticipated gadget on Sept.
14, the day it was introduced. Not only did the unit fail to arrive
when promised, but Loftus, a student at the Rochester Institute of
Technology, waited on hold for up to three hours when he called to
inquire about the problem. Last week he received a box. Inside was
a cradle for desktop synchronizing, but no Visor.
</P>
<P>
   He is still waiting for his blue Visor Deluxe. ``Twice I've
thought of calling up and canceling my order,'' Loftus said.
Instead, he said, he wrote an angry message to Handspring's
customer service department. ``I'll probably never order something
from a brand-new start-up company on the first day a product ships
ever again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dubinsky acknowledged that the frustration felt by Loftus
and others was well founded. Handspring's ordering and shipping
process has been plagued by problems since the day Loftus and a
throng of others placed orders.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to go wrong was the Web site, which the company
had planned to use to sell all its products. ``We planned to bring
up this wonderful Web site that was the logistics center of the
world,'' Ms. Dubinsky said. But the site was not ready when the
product was introduced.
</P>
<P>
   So the company has had to take orders by phone. The toll-free
lines, however, were considerably understaffed, and the call volume
was double what the company had anticipated. (``That's the good
news,'' Ms. Dubinsky said.) Hence the two, sometimes three-hour
waits.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as the orders were translated into shipping instructions,
random chunks of data throughout the system were corrupted. As a
result, some people received two Visors and some shipments were
simply not made, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dubinsky said the worst was over. She said that the staffing
of the customer service lines had improved, that the Web store,
which was open for only four days in October, was up again and
taking online orders and that the software mess was being cleaned
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're walking through it order by order by order, correcting
the data,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dubinsky declined to cite percentages, but she said ``the
majority'' of Handspring's customers had not had a problem with
their orders.
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves what Ms. Dubinsky called a ``significant minority''
who are still without their Visors and still calling two and three
times a day to find out the status of their orders.
</P>
<P>
   Although the experience has been sobering, Ms. Dubinsky said, it
offered some useful lessons. No. 1 lesson: ``We didn't have an
adequate backup plan for the Web system not being operational Day
One, and we should have,'' she said. No. 2: ``E-commerce is hard.''

REPORT LISTS WAYS NUCLEAR WEAPONS LABS CAN IMPROVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Past managers of University of California-run
weapons labs ``took security largely for granted and did not
emphasize security as much as they should have,'' a review team
charged in a report to the UC president.
</P>
<P>
   Launched five months ago in response to allegations of nuclear
spying at the labs, the report warns that the UC system ``must
continue to pursue all possible avenues to enhance security and to
identify (security) vulnerabilities.'' The report was released
Tuesday by the UC President's Council on the National Laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the report recommends:
</P>
<P>
   _ Using caution in the use of polygraph or ``lie detector''
tests on employees of the two UC-managed weapons labs, Los Alamos
National Laboratory in New Mexico and Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory in the East Bay. Both are run by UC under contract to
the U.S. Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Having more careful distinction between weapons information
that is highly secret and that which is unclassified but still
``sensitive,'' i.e. it shouldn't be distributed willy-nilly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Having labs collaborate with unidentified U.S. ``intelligence
agencies'' in studying also-unidentified foreign weapons programs _
presumably those in China, the target of recent spy allegations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Encouraging staffers to use classified, not unclassified,
computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   The report was welcomed by UC President Richard Atkinson, who
said in a statement Tuesday that the eight-member report committee
``has provided the university and the laboratories with superb
insight and guidance.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, Atkinson asked the UC President's Council to launch the
committee to determine what, if anything, the labs should do to
improve security.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has been in an uproar much of this year over charges
that China obtained secret nuclear weapons data via a spy or spies
at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials have strongly denied the charges. No arrests
have been made.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department's push for polygraph testing to catch
spies has been highly controversial. It is privately resented by at
least some of the labs' employees.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, the report's comments on polygraph testing are
delicately worded: ``Any expansion of the DOE's polygraph program
should be implemented by a sufficient number of qualified examiners
and (employees') failures of polygraph tests should be treated in a
manner that is both fair and perceived to be fair,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   The statement apparently alludes to many psychologists' and law
enforcement officers' skepticism about the credibility of ``lie-
detector'' tests.
</P>
<P>
   The report committee was chaired by John F. Ahearne, former
chair of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In seeming contradiction with its statement that lab officials
``took security largely for granted and did not emphasize security
as much as they should have,'' the report stresses that the
committee found ``no sense of any disregard for security.'' The
labs ``are working hard and commendably'' to improve security, the
report adds.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, UC spokesman Rick Malaspina said late Tuesday: ``I don't
see that much new in this report. So much (security improvement) is
already in place and under way.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Ahearne, other committee members were: Lew Allen, former
director of the super-secretive National Security Agency; William
R. Frazer, a UC-Berkeley physics professor; retired Gen.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew J. Goodpaster, former supreme commander of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization; geology Professor Raymond Jeanloz of
UC-Berkeley; law Professor Daniel Simmons of UC-Davis; Francis
Sullivan of the Institute for Defense Analyses in Washington; and
physicist Rochus E. Vogt, former provost at Caltech.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante called the report ``an important first
step'' toward improved security. ``Over the next year, I expect
that UC will demonstrate that it is the best possible manager of
the labs in Livermore and Los Alamos.''

 &HT;    HUD SEEKS CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION OF ATLANTA CONTRACTOR
 &HT;    Moving in Washington (w) and Financial (f) categories
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Housing and Urban Development official told a
congressional hearing Wednesday that his department was seeking a
criminal investigation of an Atlanta man and two partners for
possible fraud in a $367 million federal contract.
</P>
<P>
   Melton L. Harrell is president of the Atlanta-based InTown
Properties Inc., a real estate company that filed for bankruptcy
protection Sept. 22, the same day HUD terminated the firm's
contract to sell homes that came to the government through
foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Housing Commissioner William Apgar charged that InTown
had ``misrepresented to HUD the resources they would devote to this
contract.'' The agreement, signed in March, made the company the
overseer for almost 40 percent of the HUD-owned homes nationwide.
By the time HUD cancelled the contract, InTown had sold fewer than
2,300 of 25,000 U.S.-owned properties.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses told the hearing about unpaid maintenance bills,
damage to neighborhoods and local real estate markets, and of home
buyers who found the properties suddenly slapped with liens.
</P>
<P>
   Members of a House Government Reform subcommittee expressed
surprise that federal officials had signed a contract that covered
more than 20 states without checking Harrell's full background.
Harrell had spent three years in jail and a halfway house for
forgery, and at least a dozen of his companies have filed for
bankruptcy.

 &HT;    HUD SEEKS CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION OF ATLANTA CONTRACTOR
 &HT;    Moving in Washington (w) and Financial (f) categories

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Housing and Urban Development official told a
congressional hearing Wednesday that his department was seeking a
criminal investigation of an Atlanta man and two partners for
possible fraud in a $367 million federal contract.
</P>
<P>
   Melton L. Harrell is president of the Atlanta-based InTown
Properties Inc., a real estate company that filed for bankruptcy
protection Sept. 22, the same day HUD terminated the firm's
contract to sell homes that came to the government through
foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Housing Commissioner William Apgar charged that InTown
had ``misrepresented to HUD the resources they would devote to this
contract.'' The agreement, signed in March, made the company the
overseer for almost 40 percent of the HUD-owned homes nationwide.
By the time HUD cancelled the contract, InTown had sold fewer than
2,300 of 25,000 U.S.-owned properties.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses told the hearing about unpaid maintenance bills,
damage to neighborhoods and local real estate markets, and of home
buyers who found the properties suddenly slapped with liens.
</P>
<P>
   Members of a House Government Reform subcommittee expressed
surprise that federal officials had signed a contract that covered
more than 20 states without checking Harrell's full background.
Harrell had spent three years in jail and a halfway house for
forgery, and at least a dozen of his companies have filed for
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something wrong in the procedure when (the government)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For decades, the U.S. military and international relief
organizations have been searching for low-cost, effective ways to
rid the world of land mines. There are more than 100 million mines
buried in 70 countries, and they kill or maim more than 2,000
people per month, according to United Nations estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Experts agree that existing methods of detecting land mines are
costly and inefficient. Metal detectors, which are commonly used,
have high rates of false alarms due to the abundance of unrelated
scrap metal in the soil. And many mines are composed primarily of
plastic, which metal detectors cannot recognize.
</P>
<P>
   Other methods are problematic as well. Ground-penetrating radar,
which transmits high frequency energy into the ground from an
antenna, can detect large anti-tank mines, but cannot find
anti-personnel mines, which are often no larger than two inches in
diameter. And although dogs can be trained to sniff out explosives
in the ground, they have short attention spans and tire after a
couple of hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ideal system finds every land mine with no false alarms,
doesn't cost very much, uses almost no power, and contains almost
no volume,'' said Dr. Regina Dugan, head of the Defense Applied
Research Projects Agency, a division of the United States Army that
is financing several research projects in land mine detection.
</P>
<P>
   Building a detection system that meets Dr. Dugan's criteria has
been an uphill struggle. But one of the most promising projects
uses a technology called nuclear quadrupole resonance, or NQR.
Unlike metal detectors, NQR detectors seek out the explosive
material rather than the metal surrounding the land mine.
</P>
<P>
   The defense projects agency is working with Quantum Magnetics
and Information Systems Laboratories, both based in San Diego, to
develop portable nuclear quadrupole resonance devices that can
detect large and small mines.
</P>
<P>
   The detectors work by sending low- frequency radio wave pulses
into the ground. Different types of explosives produce
characteristic responses in the signals which are then picked up by
the detector.
</P>
<P>
   NQR is similar in principle to nuclear magnetic resonance, the
type of technology used in hospital imaging systems. But where the
hospital systems use large magnets to generate a nuclear magnetic
response, NQR uses a radio wave antenna that has a magnetic field
associated with it.
</P>
<P>
   Although the technology has been effective in detecting the
explosive RDX, it has been less successful in detecting the most
common explosive, TNT. But Dr. Dugan says the system will soon be
perfected to detect TNT.
</P>
<P>
   The agency plans to develop a quadrupole resonance device that
can detect virtually every type of explosive, and to incorporate
metal- detecting capabilities into the system. ``We believe that
NQR may well represent the first breakthrough we've had in land
mine detection since the invention of land mines,'' Dr. Dugan said.
``We'll know in the next couple of months if we've solved the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The prototype NQR devices resemble metal detectors _ waist-high
poles with search coils at the base. The device is connected to
amplifiers and a computer that are mounted on racks on a flatbed
truck.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to produce a system that weighs about 25 pounds,
uses 20 to 50 watts of electricity, and fits into a backpack. They
will cost $5,000 to $10,000 if produced in volume, said Dale
Sheets, president and chief executive of Quantum Magnetics.
Although this is a reasonable amount for a military budget, it may
be too expensive for many nongovernmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next step is to reduce the cost and make it rugged enough
for heavy use for both military and humanitarian demining
purposes,'' Sheets said.
</P>
<P>
   Although attempts to use NQR to detect land mines date back to
the Vietnam War, the technology lacked accuracy, which resulted in
too many false alarms.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is also financing research projects with the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Nomadics Inc., a company
based in Stillwater, Okla., toward the development of an electronic
sniffer that mimics the olfactory capabilities of dogs and other
mammals.
</P>
<P>
   A hand-held device being tested contains a small pump that draws
air containing TNT vapor from the ground across an amplifying
fluorescent polymer. Any TNT vapor in the air binds to the polymer,
diminishing the fluorescence. The diminished fluorescence is
detected by a microprocessor and other electronics inside the
device.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, it's been virtually impossible to detect TNT in the
field with an instrument,'' said Colin Cumming, president of
Nomadics. ``At this point, we're optimistic we'll have a working
prototype within a year.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to various detection technologies, efforts are being
made to standardize information on land mines that is being
collected by international organizations. With the help of the
United Nations Mine Action Service, many organizations are entering
information about the location of mines.
</P>
<P>
   The maps can be overlaid with additional information about the
area, including the locations of bridges, hospitals and water
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Tore Skedsmo, chief of the Mine Action Service, said digital
mapping programs have helped organizations analyze data about mines
according to their location, rather than their quantity. The
removal of 5 or 10 mines close to a town or bridge, for example,
takes priority over hundreds of mines in a remote field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four or five years ago,'' Skedsmo said, ``we were much more
interested in the number of mines in a given area. By looking at
the spatial relationships on the maps, we're able to look more
closely at the impact the mines have on the health and economic
situations, and to base demining action on these factors.''
</P>
<P>
   The service is developing an information management system with
the Geneva International Center for Humanitarian Demining, a
nongovernmental organization. This database and mapping software
has been developed for use worldwide, and provides a repository for
data on hazardous areas and other mine-related information.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be many different organizations, including
peacekeepers, working in a mine-affected country,'' said Alastair
McAslan, a British army colonel working with the Geneva group, ``so
we want to encourage a standard database and digitized mapping.
Access to accurate maps is essential, but in many cases it's not
possible to obtain government-controlled maps on the open market.''
</P>
<P>
   McAslan said the short-term goal is to establish an
international clearing house of maps and satellite images of
countries where there are land mines that participating
organizations could view on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a mechanism to exchange information between
governments and organizations that share a common interest,''
McAslan said.

A CHILLY WELCOME FOR DIGITAL WALLETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By IAN AUSTEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You have hunted through countless Web sites, found the perfect
gift at the best price. Now all that is left is to fill out an
order form the length of a corporate tax return.
</P>
<P>
   For all its promises of unrestrained consumerism, the Web makes
the act of paying a daunting task. Most sites force customers to
peck out line after line of personal data and lengthy credit card
numbers before they will take their money.
</P>
<P>
   When confronted with that drudgery, many Web shoppers suddenly
decide that they don't need another CD or best seller after all, no
matter how reasonable the price. According to a study that Jupiter
Communications released earlier this year, 27 percent of Web
shoppers give up on their purchases when faced with filling out
online forms.
</P>
<P>
   So it is more than a little surprising that software that can
automate the act of payment has failed to catch on, either with
consumers or merchants. Several factors have been behind that _ the
most obvious is longstanding worries about online security. But
until recently, perhaps the biggest impediment to the growth of
such software, called digital wallets, has been a lack of a
commonly accepted standard allowing all wallets to work with all
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The unpopularity of wallets means that most consumers find that
each site has its own laborious way of taking order and payment
information. Even cash would not be much of a winner if you needed
a separate kind for each brick-and-mortar store.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to reverse the short, sad history of digital wallets, a
group of credit card issuers and software makers now hope to make
it easy for consumers. Last spring Microsoft, IBM, Sun
Microsystems, Compaq and America Online (and through it, Netscape)
joined with MasterCard, Visa and American Express as well as
several smaller companies to come up with what is now stuck with a
horrible name: Electronic Commerce Modeling Language.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole ECML initiative is about making it idiotproof to
automatically fill out forms worldwide,'' said Art Kranzely, senior
vice president for e-commerce at MasterCard International. `` We've
got to make it as simple as the physical world, where you swipe
your card and it's done.''
</P>
<P>
   ECML is not itself a wallet, nor is it a credit account. It is
computer coding _ invisible to ordinary users _ that tags the
information typed by consumers into specific boxes at the time they
set up their ``wallets.''
</P>
<P>
   Any computer running software using the ECML standard then
knows, for example, that one set of numbers represents a street
address, another is a ZIP code and others are telephone and credit
card numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But ECML would not require that all Web site order forms and all
digital wallets look the same _ a point clearly demonstrated by the
different approaches that IBM and Microsoft are taking.
</P>
<P>
   The latest IBM Consumer Wallet, the company's first
ECML-compliant e-wallet, is available on a CD-ROM or by downloading
software. Distributed by MasterCard and its card issuers, it will
allow its users to store data from all their credit cards, even
competing brands, and ultimately make debit card purchases as well.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Kilroy, IBM's general manager for e-commerce, anticipates
that episodes like the recent security breach at Microsoft's
HotMail service will mean that consumers will be willing to go
through the bother of installing yet another program to avoid
storing their personal information _ particularly credit card
numbers _ on a server somewhere on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Once installed, the wallet leaves a small icon on a toolbar of a
Windows 95 or 98, or NT, computer. When confronted with a blank
order form, the user opens the wallet, clicks on Auto-fill, selects
a credit card and all is done _ assuming that the Web site uses
ECML.
</P>
<P>
   If not, the wallet has a drag-and-drop feature for filling out
forms that is marginally handier than typing everything out one
more time.
</P>
<P>
   The recently revamped Microsoft Passport, however, follows
HotMail's example and is entirely Web-based, allowing users to have
access to it from any computer with a Web browser. Not
surprisingly, Josh Herst, Microsoft's group product manager for
Passport, is quick to dismiss any suggestion that the arrangement
could pose security problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft system will fill in forms only on Web sites that
have a Passport logo. While that seems contrary to the concept of
universal wallets, Herst said that Microsoft ``requires a
relationship'' with the merchants to make sure that they are
legitimate and that they meet the software company's privacy
standards. As part of that deal, Microsoft designed the system so
it has no idea what items Passport customers are buying. Herst
said, ``The fundamental vision of Microsoft Passport is consumer
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its wonders, it appears that the fate of Passport and
other ECML digital wallets will probably rest with merchants, and
that could prove to be a long-term stumbling block.
</P>
<P>
   While the system has the support of some major e-commerce
forces, like AOL, notably absent from the list of merchants backing
ECML are some of the biggest names in online shopping, particularly
Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Why wouldn't major online stores want to make life easier for
customers? The Jupiter Communications study suggests that
standardized payment systems also make it easier for competitors to
steal one another's customers. Unless there's a huge difference in
price or service, there is little incentive for online shoppers to
abandon a merchant that already has their vital statistics on file.
</P>
<P>
   The very suggestion that Amazon would go out of its way to make
it harder for its customers to shop around offends Rene Pelegero,
Amazon's manager of global payment services.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a rather cynical view of the world,'' he said. But
Pelegero acknowledged that Amazon had no plans to replace its
1-Click system, a form-filling template that works only on
Amazon.com, with a service based on ECML
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazon has 8 million customers and so far, to the best of my
knowledge, we've had minimal to no demand for wallets,'' he said.
``Wallets are good for the merchants, banks and wallet companies
pushing them. But it's not clear what's in it for the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   If a significant number of other major e-commerce companies
share Amazon's view, ECML may wither like earlier wallet attempts,
ultimately making it impossible for shoppers to decide that
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it would be nice if buying a CD online someday became a
little easier than applying for a personal loan.

<P>
   With Kenny dying a violent death at the end of every ``South
Park'' episode, wrestlers on cable channels engaging in
round-the-clock head banging, and plenty of bare skin in prime
time, it is not surprising that many parents find a lot of what is
on television unsuitable for their children.
</P>
<P>
   But when offered something that would block violent or racy
shows from their television sets, would parents actually use it?
</P>
<P>
   It seems not, if the arrival of the V-chip is any indication.
The V-chip, circuitry that can be used to block programs according
to a ratings system, quickly gained the support of Congress and
parents' groups in the mid 1990s after it was developed by Tim
Collings, a Canadian professor and engineer. As of July 1, the
Federal Communications Commission, carrying out a mandate from
Congress, has required manufacturers to include a V-chip in half of
its televisions with screens over 13 inches. By January, all sets
over that size sold in the United States will be required to have
one.
</P>
<P>
   But whether it is because of a lack of consumer awareness, or
because it is difficult to use or because parents do not feel they
need it, the V-chip has few users, judging by interviews with
retailers, industry experts and consumers. Even groups that support
the V-chip acknowledge that it has yet to catch on with the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very supportive of it, but there's very little real
media information about it,'' said Ginny Markell, president of the
National PTA. ``There's a huge percentage of the population that's
unaware that it's even available, and unless a family's in the
market for a new TV, it's not on their radar.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the V-chip and the ratings system say they can be
useful aids to parents in controlling what their children watch.
But the federal mandate is viewed by many manufacturers,
broadcasters and parents as unwanted government interference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't feel it was applicable to us, because a lot of our
programming is music videos, said Greg King, a spokesman for Black
Entertainment Television, a cable broadcaster that does not use the
ratings system, which is voluntary. ``But once you go ahead with a
ratings system, it makes you wonder what's next, as far as
censorship goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Russ Neuman, a professor at the Annenberg School for
Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, said that the
V-chip ``became about politics and economics rather than children
and viewing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``However well intentioned it was at its inception, it may not
have anywhere near the effect of its intended purpose,'' Neuman
added.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Retailers say consumer interest in the V-chip is lukewarm, and
that the technology is not much of a selling point for
televisions.(The latest gee-whiz features of which are
picture-in-picture and Dolby sound.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not on the tip of people's minds right now,'' said
Michael Perlman, president of BrandsMart USA, the Miami-based
retail chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't really surprise me that we're not seeing people
coming in droves to get it,'' said Dave Arland, a spokesman for
Thomson Consumer Electronics, based in Indianapolis, which
manufactures RCA and GE televisions. ``It's not something that
America was clamoring for. It's something that Congress was
clamoring for.''
</P>
<P>
   Arland said that although the chip adds only minimally to the
price of a television, Thomson would have preferred to offer it as
an added feature for those who really wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Tristani, an FCC commissioner and chairwoman of the
V-Chip Task Force, which was put together in May, acknowledged that
lack of awareness was a problem. ``It's hard to get people to use
something if they don't know it exists,'' she said, ``so the major
problem is getting information out there.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tristani added that the task force was urging retailers to
publish flyers about the V-chip, and that broadcast associations
and networks would be sponsoring public service announcements about
it in November to coincide with the holiday shopping season.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers including The Wiz, Sears and BrandsMart USA have not
run advertisements about the V-chip's availability, partly, they
say, because of the lack of consumer interest.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The rating system itself, which was developed by representatives
from the National Association of Broadcasters, the National Cable
Television Association and the Motion Picture Association of
America, is difficult to understand, with six basic ratings that
can be subdivided for specific content like adult language or
violence. And because the networks rate their own programs, what
constitutes suggestive dialogue on one network might not on
another.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasters that use the system play down the problems. ``There
was some initial concern that the ratings system might be a little
complicated, but we've trained our editors, and we're very
comfortable with the internal consistency of the ratings within our
department,'' said Julie Hoover, a spokeswoman for ABC. ``If a
parent watches a little programming and gets familiar with the
ratings, it becomes pretty clear what the designations are.''
</P>
<P>
   But others outside the broadcast industry have a less charitable
view of the ratings system, believing that it is purposely complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the interest of the broadcasters to make the V-chip
technology as useless as possible so that it wouldn't ever
eliminate any potential audience,'' Neuman said. ``That's the
economics of box office ratings, as well as the ratings for
television.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of using technology to help parents control what their
children watch has long had support in Congress, which in 1996
overwhelmingly passed a law overhauling the communications
industry. That law included the requirement that V-chips be added
to televisions. And in surveys, parents have applauded the V-chip,
at least in theory. In the latest such poll, of 1,000 parents
conducted this year by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, an
independent national health care philanthropy, 77 percent said they
would use the V-chip if they had one. But that theoretical support
has not translated into actual use.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents believe that monitoring their children's television
viewing is their responsibility and bristle at the notion that they
need a V-chip. ``I don't know how the V-chip works, but I don't
really trust that someone else is going to have better judgment
than we will,'' said Kevin Mann of Brockport, N.Y., who has a
6-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize that most parents have jobs and can't be with their
kids at all times, but the V-chip is just one more instance where
parents are being given the opportunity to relegate their
responsibility to someone or something else,'' said Mike Jenkins,
of Dublin, Ohio, whose 11-year-old daughter watches television only
when accompanied by her parents.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates of the V-chip say it can be an effective tool for
keeping young children from stumbling across something they should
not see. Joanne Cantor, a children's media consultant and the
author of ``Mommy I'm Scared: How TV and Movies Frighten Children,
and What We Can Do to Protect Them'' (Harcourt Brace, 1998) uses an
RCA television on loan from Thomson Consumer Electronics to block
some programs and movies for her 10-year-old son. ``I pretty well
trust him,'' Ms. Cantor said. ``I think of the V-chip as less of a
policing function and more of a protecting function.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But even parents who want to use the V-chip will find the system
difficult to set up. With most televisions, the V-chip can be
programmed by pressing the menu button on the remote control. (On
some models, the chip is programmed with controls on the surface of
the television set). The parent chooses a personal identification
number, or lock code, which allows the parent to activate,
deactivate and change the controls.
</P>
<P>
   Parents can select as few or as many of the six program ratings
in the scale that they want to allow. For example, by selecting
only programs that are rated TVY, (for children of all ages), any
program with a TVY7 rating (for children age 7 and older), up to
TV14 (for children 14 and older) and TVMA (for Mature Audience
Only), will be blocked out. Without the lock code, children cannot
change the programming selections.
</P>
<P>
   Content descriptors, which were added to the age-based ratings
in negotiations with child advocacy groups in July 1997, signify
the presence of violence (V), sexual situations (S), coarse
language (L), suggestive dialogue (D) or fantasy violence (FV),
which is defined as ``fighting presented in an exciting _ even
thrilling _ way.''
</P>
<P>
   Although not indecipherable, it takes time to understand how to
use the V-chip and ratings system. When presented on the screen and
in program listings, the boxes of letters and numbers for the
rating resemble something one might have to recite in front of an
eye doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts say the system's complexity contributes to
consumers' ambivalence. ``The V-Chip's user interface and the
rating systems are not particularly intuitive or convenient,'' said
Jay Srivatsa, senior industry analyst at Dataquest, a research firm
in San Jose, Calif. ``If people can't figure out how to use it
within a few minutes, they might not bother.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the system is far from perfect, parents need to learn
how to use it, said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center
for Media Education, which publishes a guide to the V-chip
(www.vchipeducation.org). ``Parents are going to have to get used
to this alphabet soup of guides telling them what's in the content
as we enter the digital age, and Internet content becomes available
on TV,'' he said. ``The V-chip is the first formal development in
what will be a heavily rated media world.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a stormy interlude earlier this week, the nation's weather
will return to the tranquil pattern that prevailed during the later
half of October. Several intense low-pressure systems should
dominate Canada, which will lead to a flow of milder air from the
Pacific spreading over the contiguous states. This scenario will
continue for the remainder of this week.
</P>
<P>
   Very chilly air over the Northeast will retreat into Canada as
brisk winds shift and begin to blow from the southwest. The first
part of the day will still bring snow showers from eastern Lake
Ontario to the mountains of New England. Sunshine will be the rule
near the coast and from the Middle Atlantic States to the Gulf
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Another cold morning will greet the Deep South with early season
freezes expected in the Carolinas and Georgia. Abundant sunshine
will raise temperatures to seasonal levels. Onshore winds should
increase in Florida leading to more clouds on the Atlantic coast.
</P>
<P>
   Warmer air will surge northward through the Plains and into the
Mississippi Valley. The return of milder air into the upper Middle
West will be accompanied by some clouds. A cold front pushing east
from the Dakotas will be marked by thickening clouds and shifting
winds.
</P>
<P>
   A stream of Pacific moisture along the front will cause a few
showers from western Montana to southern Oregon. The clouds will
break in the Northwest as high pressure moves into northern
Washington. Coastal fog will prevail in central California. The
Southwest will stay mostly sunny and seasonably warm, though
patches of high clouds are expected.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Season for Snow
</P>
<P>
   Fitful bursts of snow greeted motorists traveling on Interstate
90 between Cleveland and Buffalo on Wednesday as the season's first
``lake-effect'' snow fell across the region. A discharge of
Canadian air over the relatively tepid lake waters set the stage
for the snow. When cold air passes over a warm body of water, it is
moistened and heated from below. Akin to a hot air balloon, the
warmed air becomes buoyant and ascends rapidly. The ascending air
cools to saturation, causing clouds and eventually snow to form. In
some winters, the lakes can contribute up to 100 inches of snow in
some spots.

 &HT;    Open three months, Southeast's largest retail and entertainment
complex wows shoppers with its distinct Georgia flavor
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The dust has finally settled from Rabun Gap to Tybee
Light.
</P>
<P>
   No, we're not talking about the state of Georgia but rather
Gwinnett County's Mall of Georgia. Thematically divided into five
geographic regions, the 1.7 million-square-foot retail and
entertainment complex _ the largest in the Southeast _ takes
shoppers on an educational walk through the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our approach was to provide a place that's representative of
Georgia and its culture,'' said mall developer Ben Carter. ``We
wanted to make going to the mall more than just shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   Set off by colorful murals, interactive displays and historic
panels, each court area of the 3-month-old mall celebrates a
different region. The Coastal area reflects the shoreline and
cities such as Savannah and Brunswick. The Plains showcases
Georgia's agricultural roots, while the Piedmont reflects the
manufacturing industry. The Mountains show the state's rich
heritage and Atlanta celebrates the city's cultural diversity. A
neat touch is the decorative frieze around the ceiling in each
region spelling out the names of cities and towns located there.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Tuesday, Ruth West of Hartwell (Ga.) came for the
day with a group from the First Baptist Church of Hartwell. ``I
think it's lovely, very open and airy,'' she said of the mall.
``The murals are most unusual, and I recognize the names of many
Georgia towns on the wall borders.''
</P>
<P>
   Furnishings also reflect the individual areas. For example, the
carpet pattern in the Savannah Gardens is the magnolia, while in
the Mountain Lodge, it's oak leaves and pine needles. After hours
of shopping, you can relax on sturdy log furniture or sit in a
wicker chair, complete with reading lamps. It's more like sitting
in your living room than in a shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   On their first visit to the mall, Charles and Brenda Verhoff of
Jefferson City, Mo., were taking in the sights with Victor Pruett,
their 1-year-old grandson, who lives in Jefferson with his parents
Laura and Ernie Pruett. ``I like the (mall) layout,'' said Brenda.
``Even though it's big, we're not getting lost. I don't know if
I've ever looked as closely at the architecture in a mall before as
I have here. A lot of thought went into the design, from the old
time light fixtures to the carpeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Architectural details do make this mall more than just another
place to shop. The arching iron roof in the food court is patterned
after Atlanta's 1870 Union Station, known as the ``train shed.''
And the sleek overhead lighting of the ``arcade,'' which links the
Atlanta area to the other regions in the mall, is based on the
``spirit'' of the old Peachtree Arcade, a turn-of-the-century
shopping center in downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, the official name of this shopping complex is the
Mall of Georgia at Mill Creek. The name is the brainchild of
developer Carter, who drew inspiration from Ivy Creek, which runs
through the property, and Woodward Mill, a previous grain mill
along the creek.
</P>
<P>
   A happening place
</P>
<P>
   ``Malls are trying to create more than just a shopping
experience for the customer,'' says David Rush, a principal with
Kurt Salmon Associates in Atlanta. ``They are making it into a
family outing with theaters, exhibits, fine dining and concerts.
They are reaching out to hold on to their consumer base.''
</P>
<P>
   And reach out they do. For example, you can visit the Village
that's also part of the mall, just outside the food court. It's
reminiscent of a town square, with free-standing, two-story brick
and coated stucco buildings containing a Barnes &AMP; Noble, with a
Harold's and Restoration Hardware opening soon, and California Cafe
Bar &AMP; Grill opening on Nov. 17 and P.F. Chang's China Bistro in
late December. An interactive fountain and amphitheater on the
village green draw kids and shoppers or those who just want to sit
down and enjoy the sights and sounds. During the holidays, plans
call for an ice-skating rink and a stand for selling Christmas
trees.
</P>
<P>
   And next year, you can visit the Nature Park, which will open in
summer 2000 adjacent to the mall. It will preserve existing
wetlands and be home to deer, beavers, raccoons and a variety of
birds and butterflies. The Nature Center, a historically accurate
reconstruction of the gristmill originally on this site, will have
exhibits and meeting rooms.
</P>
<P>
   With 200 stores and vendor carts to be open by Dec. 1 _ plus a
20-screen Regal Cinema and the only 3-D Imax theater in the state _
the mall has already pulled in plenty of people.
</P>
<P>
   Build it and they will come
</P>
<P>
   ``We have spotted cars from every state and from all over the
metro area,'' said Scott Higley, marketing director for the mall,
which is part of the Simon Property Group. ``By the time the
holiday shopping season arrives, we will have had close to 3
million visitors.''
</P>
<P>
   And all these people seem to be there on the weekends. Ashley
Edwards, a manager at People's Pottery, a shop representing more
than 600 American artists, reports ``slower traffic during the week
but it's great on Saturdays and Sundays.''
</P>
<P>
   One shop that's constantly busy is Build-a-Bear Workshop. Lines
regularly form filled with tots and teens as well as grandmothers.
``It's just a fun place,'' said Tonya Lynn of Auburn, who was
buying a bear for her 11-month-old son, Jake. ``There's not another
store like it.''
</P>
<P>
   As you enter, you choose a bear _ cub, classic, curly, floppy _
from $10 to $40, then proceed to watch him get stuffed and
stitched, then fluffed and dressed. The latter hikes the price a
bit. After paying, your friend goes home in a box dubbed the Cub
Condo.
</P>
<P>
   This location was the first in Georgia, but another Build-a-Bear
just opened in Town Center at Cobb. ``But that won't hurt our
business,'' said Shelley Ell, an assistant manager at the workshop.
``The stores are miles apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Another drawing card for these stores? They offer birthday
parties in the store until Nov. 13. Then, these eveinto
``hibernation'' until the middle of January, to avoid the holiday
rush.
</P>
<P>
   The anchor stores are also reporting good sales. La Velle Olexa,
a senior vice president of marketing at Lord &AMP; Taylor, says the
chain is ``encouraged by the response from customers.'' The
company's exclusive private label merchandise, she says, is selling
exceptionally well, including short-sleeve cashmere sweaters
($49.99) and matching cardigans ($69.99). ``This is an astute
shopper, and she wants good value for her money,'' said Olexa,
referring to the mall's clientele.
</P>
<P>
   With the opening of this store, Lord &AMP; Taylor has three in the
Atlanta area _ the others are at Phipps Plaza and North Point Mall.
All three are stocked with much the same merchandise. The only
variable, according to Olexa, is proportion of stock in stores.
``If one store sells more Tommy Hilfiger than the other two, we
will put more Tommy in that store,'' she said. ``As retailers, we
try to respond quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Retail consultant Brenda Gilpatrick predicts the Mall of Georgia
will have a healthy customer base resulting from day shoppers from
South Carolina and southeastern Tennessee as well as from towns
along the I-85 north corridor. ``And once Nordstrom opens (March
2000) and Rich's opens (December 2000), that base will become even
stronger,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Something for everyone
</P>
<P>
   The mall has created an interesting mix of tenants. ``We have
gone after such stores as Old Navy and Bed, Bath &AMP; Beyond, who
traditionally are outside the mall as competitors, and have put
them inside,'' said Higley. ``Also, Haverty's Furniture and
Galyan's sporting goods are both attached to the mall. We are in an
`age of convenience' for the customer.''
</P>
<P>
   In another customer-friendly move, the mall, when possible, has
grouped stores by category. For example, the Children's Place,
Gymboree, Stride Rite, Limited Too and the Disney Store, are within
easy walking distance of each other on the first level, pleasing
mothers and fathers no end. Although you have to go upstairs,
Abercrombie Kids, a children's version of the parent store
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, has proved popular with families.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the smartest additions at the Mall of Georgia are two
family restrooms just off the food court. Amenities include an
infants changing room and a nursing room. Here, also, mothers don't
have to abandon young sons or fathers their tiny daughters to
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives me such peace of mind,'' said Wendy Miller of
Chattanooga as she waited for her 6-year-old son, Chris, on a busy
Saturday. ``I wish all malls had these.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The best photo op in the mall is the Mountain Fountain, in
Mountain Court. Water sluices around a two-story rock formation.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The No. 1 door for shoppers entering the mall is from the
Village into the food court.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  How to get there: From downtown, take 1-85 north, get off at
Exit 46 and take Ga. 20 west.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Valet parking: $3, at marquee entrance of the mall.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Holiday doings: Santa Claus arrives 6:30 p.m. Nov. 20 in the
Village.
</P>

 &HT;    SHOPPING DESTINATION: Pine Mountain, Georgia
 &HT;    Callaway gardens not only attraction in town
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE MOUNTAIN _ A railroad runs through it _ as do most folks
who drive through on U.S. 27 intent on getting to Callaway Gardens.
What's the hurry? Linger awhile in the historic downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The town known as Chipley until 1958 is a worthy day trip even
if you aren't planning to visit Callaway Gardens or other nearby
attractions such as Roosevelt State Park, Wild Animal Safari or
Butts Mill Farm.
</P>
<P>
   Several new shops that opened in old storefronts in recent
months join such mainstays as Kimbrough's General Store and
Magdaline's Accents. Whether you're looking for antiques or
decorative items to spiff up your home or garden, you're sure to
find something to suit your style.
</P>
<P>
   Works by area artists and craftspeople are well represented,
adding to the distinct local flavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just been thrilled with what has happened here,'' says
Bruce Thompson, a self-described ``recovering attorney'' who owns
three Main Street businesses (Sweet Home Antiques, Chanticleer and
Country Gardens) with his partner, Phil Rogers. ``It's a real
renaissance. I don't think we can do anything but grow _ not in
size but in the quality of the shops and events.''
</P>
<P>
   So park your car and enjoy one-stop shopping along Main,
Commerce and Broad streets. Give yourself four or five hours to do
the town justice. You can't help but slow down here. Not only will
you be browsing (and most likely buying), but you'll find yourself
chatting with the friendly shopkeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the expected _ quality antiques and some great junk _
you'll find some nice surprises. For starters, who'd expect this
little town to have a funky place like Cool Stuff, where
collectible toys, games and comic books, Pokemon cards, '70s
hand-held electronic games, new and vintage chess sets and incense
burners vie for attention?
</P>
<P>
   You'll love making discovery after discovery: A row of
wonderfully well-worn wooden sleds _ Rosebud! _ lined up in the
window of Eddie Murphy's Interiors &AMP; Antiques. Fabulously flashy
rhinestone jewelry, earbobs, brooches, chokers and bracelets in
every color of the rainbow at Heart of the South Antiques. A pair
of barely worn size 6 red leather ladies' cowboy boots at Simple
Pleasures. Folk art by the likes of Howard Finster, R.A. Miller and
Butch Anthony at Country Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   At Mountain Creek, which opened in mid-August, Karen Plant _ the
Lower Chattahoochee Riverkeeper until October 1998 _ has parlayed
her love of nature, wildlife, outdoor recreation and the
environment into a business venture. The shop carries nature-themed
gifts and crafts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shop allows me to still talk to people about environmental
concerns and do a little environmental education _ that goes
especially for the kids,'' says Plant.
</P>
<P>
   At Now and Then Antiques, a former Pure Oil gas station, you'll
find _ among many other things _ a cache of gifts gathered by Clara
Belle Hall of Berea, Ky., more than three decades ago for a shop
she hoped one day to open.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lady never got around to opening her shop,'' says
Charlotte Boykin. After Hall's death in 1993, Boykins says she
``bought the entire storage unit sight unseen. It's been like
Christmas unpacking the boxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the treasures are crafts made by Berea College students
more than 35 years ago _ baskets, brooms, pottery, weavings,
woodcrafts, corn shuck dolls and finger puppets.
</P>
<P>
   Anchoring Main Street is Magdaline's Accents, where artist
Maggie Yanko runs an eclectic art gallery and gift shop. She's been
at her present location for four years, but she has been in
business for a decade. She was instrumental in launching many of
the town's festivals and events to draw tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud to say I helped Pine Mountain grow to what it is
now,'' says Yanko.
</P>
<P>
   If you go
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: Take 1-85 south to I-185 (Exit 5) and continue
south to Exit 14. Turn left onto U.S. 27 and drive 10 miles into
town.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hours: Most shops are open 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Mondays-Saturdays
and Sunday afternoons; however, some open limited hours Thursdays
through Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Parking: Plenty of on-street parking.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Handicapped access: Most stores are accessible.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Restrooms: In the Welcome Center and inside Simple Pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: The Pine Mountain Tourism Association operates a
Welcome Center at 101 Broad (at Commerce). Call 1-800-441-3502.
</P>
<P>
   Where to eat
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  McGuire's Family Restaurant: If you get a midafternoon
hankering for breakfast, this friendly downtown diner is the place
to go for omelets ($2.75-$5.95), pancakes ($1.95 for one to $6.45
for a stack with fruit topping plus two eggs and choice of meat),
homemade biscuits (95 cents to $2.95, depending what's on the
inside) and eggs with sausage patties or links, streak-o-lean, ham
or corned beef hash ($3.75-$4.95). The extensive menu also includes
soups and salads; burgers and sandwiches; and beef, pork, fish,
chicken or quail entrees ($6.95-$12.95). And be sure to order some
fried green tomatoes for an appetizer, y'all ($3.75). U.S. 27, a
block north of the heart of the shopping district. 706-663-2640.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Also recommended: Chipley Subs, 150 Commerce St., is next to
the Welcome Center. 706-663-8043. The new Carriages and Horses,
about a mile out of town, is getting raves for its ``international
country'' cuisine. 607 Butts Mill Road, 706-663-4777. Go for spicy
Cajun and Creole fare (including fabulous homemade desserts) at
Cricket's Restaurant, open for dinner only. 706-663-8136. Quick
bites along U.S. 27: KFC Express (706-663-9300), Krispy Fried
Chicken (706-663-4724), Mac's Barbecue (706-663-8423), San Marcos
Mexican Restaurant (706-663-8075) and Sportsman's Grill
(706-663-8064).
</P>
<P>
   Where to stay
</P>
<P>
   You'll have to drive a few miles south for a B&AMP;B experience at
Magnolia Hall, an 1890s Victorian home in Hamilton (706-628-4566),
or Raintree Farms, a circa 1933 plantation home in Waverly Hall
(706-582-3227). If you want to stay really close to the shopping,
there are several mom-and-pop motels, including Fireside Inn
(706-663-4141) and Pine Mountain Motel (706-663-2306) _ nothing
fancy, but clean and comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond shopping
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Gearing up for the holiday season: As Callaway Gardens opens
its Fantasy of Lights holiday illumination on Nov. 19
(1-800-252-5292), Pine Mountain gets in on the act the same evening
with Light Up Downtown, featuring refreshments at the Welcome
Center, holiday music and lights. Christmas in Pine Mountain on
Dec. 3-4, 10-11 and 17-18 provides extended hours for holiday
shopping (706-663-5900). The Chipley Woman's Club Holiday Tour of
Homes is Dec. 11 (1-800-4413-3502).

 &HT;    Locating hard to find items
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Having trouble finding a particular item? We'll try to
help you locate it. But due to the volume of mail, we cannot track
down every request. Readers whose queries are answered in the
column will receive a blue-and-cream canvas Buyer's Edge tote bag.
Write us at Buyer's Edge Find It, Atlanta Journal-Constitution,
P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, GA 30302; e-mail us at
buyersedge(at)ajc.com (please include your name, the city you live
in and daytime phone number);
</P>
<P>
   Q: I sent a California friend an audiotape of WSM radio's Grand
Ole Opry, where ads for the candy Goo Goo Clusters have run for
decades. He asked for some, but I can't find them here. Must I go
to Nashville or can you help me?
</P>
<P>
   _Tom Roche, Tucker (Ga.)
</P>
<P>
   A: No need to drive to the country music city. Pick up these
classic Southern candies at Cracker Barrel Old Country Stores. We
found our treat at the location in Norcross: 6175 McDonough Drive
(770-446-1313). Ten 1.5-ounce clusters in a box are $4.59.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1912, the Standard Candy Co. in Nashville has been turning
out these sweet concoctions of caramel, marshmallow, pecans and
milk chocolate. Company founder and inventer Howard Campbell came
up with the candy but didn't know what to call it. A friend
suggested Goo Goo, since ``it's so good people will ask for it from
birth.'' And, as the saying goes, the rest is history.
Incidentally, one cluster has 200 calories, with 90 calories from
fat.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for a medicated shampoo for my two dogs,
manufactured by the Zema Corp. of North Carolina. It is the best
for relieving dry skin and body odors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bonnie Bradley,
</P>
<P>
   Chamblee (Ga.)
</P>
<P>
   A: Your two best friends can enjoy their shampoos with Zema's
Medicated Shampoo with Salicylic Acid and Aloe (a 13-ounce bottle,
$3.99). According to the company spokeswoman, the pleasant-smelling
pink shampoo ``cleans the coat gently and thoroughly and helps
relieve the itching associated with dry and flaky skin.'' You can
order it through Carealot mail order at 1-800-343-7680. Ask for
item No. 3305. Or look up the company at its Web site:
www.carealotpets.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is anyone still selling Adrien Arpel makeup? Rich's used to
carry it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nancy Larson, Peachtree City(Ga.)
</P>
<P>
   Another beauty question: I am looking for Diane Von
Furstenberg's fragrance Tatiana.
</P>
<P>
   _ Parthenia Mitchell, East Point(Ga.)
</P>
<P>
   A: Shop in the convenience of your home for these items. They
are sold through the Home Shopping Network, available on most cable
systems throughout metro Atlanta. You can also shop online at
www.hsn.com or call 1-800-284-3100 to order merchandise. Cosmetics
diva Adrien Arpel makes Signature Club A cosmetics and treatment
line exclusively for The Home Shopping Network. Items range from
mascaras and lipsticks to creams and compacts. Watch for Arpel, who
will be on the program today through Monday. Check for times. She
will be demonstrating products from her Spa Couture Collection kit
($79.95, shown).
</P>
<P>
   Another item on HSN is clothing designer Diane Von Furstenberg's
fragrance Tatiana. Named for her daughter, this floral scent, which
debuted in 1975, is dominated by orange blossom with underlying
green notes. A 1.5-ounce bottle is $27.50. You can also buy Tatiana
through the Beauty Boutique catalog. A 1.5-ounce eau de parfum
spray is $24.99. To order: 1-800-497-7463.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm looking for Vacuum-Seal Storage Packs or Space Bags that
I saw advertised on TV. My son and daughter-in-law are in the Air
Force, stationed in Guam, and I want to send them some, but I've
been unable to find the bags.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mary Felice, Stockbridge (Ga.)
</P>
<P>
   A: We bagged your Space Bags at Waccamaw, 608 Holcomb Bridge
Road, Roswell (770-992-4882).
</P>
<P>
   One jumbo bag _ 36 inches by 49 inches _ is $14.99. Or order the
bag through the Harriet Carter catalog. A jumbo size, number E3313,
is $12.85; a large bag, number E3312, is $9.85. It's 22 inches by
34 inches. Call 1-800-377-7878.
</P>
<P>
   Use the transparent space bag to store bulky items in a fraction
of the space they would normally take. It's simple to do. Only pack
dry items. Press the bag flat, leaving 3 inches in front of the
opening. To seal, start at one end and, in 1-inch increments,
squeeze between thumb and forefinger and slide along the length of
the zipper. Repeat in opposite direction to complete seal. Remove
excess air by using a household or shop vaccum cleaner with hose
attachment. Q: I have been looking for two years for a silver
aluminum Christmas tree with a revolving color wheel.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cyndi Underwood, Duluth (Ga.)
</P>
<P>
   Another tree plea: I'm in the market for a silver aluminum
Christmas tree like my grandmother owned when I was a little girl.
You had to assemble the tree.
</P>
<P>
   _ Helen E. Corona, Acworth (Ga.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet another inquiry: As a child, we had an aluminum Christmas
tree. I would love to find one that's at least 5 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gina Petrus, Cumming (Ga.)
</P>
<P>
   And one last plea: In the '60s, we had an aluminum Christmas
tree with a light wheel that had rotating colors. My daughter would
like to have one and I hope you can help me.
</P>
<P>
   _ Marie Hughes, Rutledge (Ga.)
</P>
<P>
   A: Soon, all of you can alumin-ate your houses with a shiny,
shimmery tree that first gained popularity in the '60s and '70s. We
found these classics on the Web at www.bestbymail.com. (Click on
site map, then aluminum trees). Or call 1-800-648-8727. Each tree
has branches made from noncorrosive aluminum foil and comes with
its own stand and rotating four-color wheel called Color-
</P>
<P>
   Splash. A 4-foot tree is $279 with 54 branches; a 5-foot tree is
$319 with 67 branches.
</P>
<P>
   You might also find a vintage aluminum tree at an antique store.
Cache Antiques, 1845 Cheshire Bridge Road N.E. (404-815-0880), has
an aluminum tree in the original box. It has no stand or color
wheel and is $155. Another dealer has four color wheels for $65
each.

BUYING GROCERIES ONLINE? FORGET ABOUT LAMB SHANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If my expectations for online grocery shopping were high, it was
because I had heard many wondrous stories: of delivery
``ambassadors'' in Chicago who arrived at the door anxious whether
the bananas were exactly ripe, of customers in Boston with
refrigerators in their garages to accommodate round-the-clock ice
cream delivery, of lucky mothers in Seattle who had not been inside
a supermarket with a screaming child in months.
</P>
<P>
   What could be more perfect, I thought, than to order what I
needed to make roasted lamb shanks for dinner. I was pretty excited
as I drew up my debut shopping list _ meat, carrots, parsnips, beef
broth, fresh rosemary, leeks, onions _ because I pictured myself
finally escaping the tyranny of the supermarket system. Never again
would I wait in a checkout line for 20 minutes, lug heavy bags to
the car in the rain or revisit the deli aisle where, a couple of
months back, the baby ripped open a plastic tub of red Jell-O and
squished gobs of it into her hair.
</P>
<P>
   But when I logged on to compare the services of some leading
online grocers _ Peapod, Netgrocer, Homegrocer, Streamline and
Homeruns _ I realized that this was not going to be as easy as I
had hoped. In fact _ let's not mince words _ there seemed to be a
huge problem. Every time I typed in my ZIP code, I was taunted by a
response like Peapod's: ``Local Delivery Currently Unavailable.''
</P>
<P>
   As I discovered, none of the these online grocers offered local
delivery in my neighborhood on New York's Long Island. Unwilling to
abandon my vision of the friendly delivery ambassador knocking on
my door _ I imagined him in a uniform shirt with his name (Bud)
sewn above the pocket _ I broadened my search.
</P>
<P>
   I went to my favorite comparison-shopping sources,
www.gomez.com, which publishes useful scorecards ranking all kinds
of online businesses. But of the 10 companies the site had
reviewed, none offered local delivery in my area.
</P>
<P>
   I phoned Nick Karris, a senior analyst at Gomez Advisors, to
complain. But even after I explained the magnitude of the
situation, including the fact that my family, who tend to get
pretty surly when hungry, had been promised lamb shanks by 7 p.m.,
Karris seemed unmoved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where you live on Long Island, coverage is pretty thin,''
Karris said. ``In fact, the whole New York area is a bit of an
anomaly because distribution is so difficult there. But really, to
be fair, you have to look at the big picture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do you live?'' I asked suspiciously. ``Boston area,
right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he replied, ``we have four major players who compete
here. My groceries can be waiting for me in the garage, in a little
refrigerator that one company put in there free of charge, or I can
schedule any time I want them to arrive up until about 10 o'clock
at night, so they're there right when I get home and want to make
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   This was not improving my mood. Nor did it help to learn that
most of America was in the same boat. Industry analysts estimate
that online grocers are offering local deliveries to only a
relatively few lucky shoppers who live in selected areas of the
nation's 30 most populated metropolitan centers.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing that made me wonder what the holdup was. After all, some
of these companies have been in business for several years. Peapod
was founded in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   A Peapod spokeswoman, Paula Wheeler, tried to explain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's complicated,'' Ms. Wheeler said. ``We're constantly
opening up new markets as fast as we can, but we have to find local
retail partners to operate distribution centers, and we have to
know that we will have enough customers to fill up a whole truck
route.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come a long way from when we started out 10 years ago in
a suburb of Chicago. We used to drive to the store and shop for a
customer and then drive it right to their house.''
</P>
<P>
   Believe me, I'd settle for that. For now, the only online option
for me _ and most of America _ is to order from companies that will
mail groceries, a process that can take several business days.
</P>
<P>
   To test the usefulness of this option, I placed mail orders for
groceries with two companies: Netgrocer and Peapod. It took about
20 minutes to register and navigate each well-designed site, search
the respective inventories of 7,000 items _ Peapod _ and 10,000
items _ Netgrocer _ for what I wanted and place orders for
nonperishables like toilet paper, beef broth and Cheerios.
</P>
<P>
   Both sites sent immediate e-mail to confirm the order and
allowed me to change it before it was mailed.
</P>
<P>
   Neither company will send fresh fruits or vegetables or even
frozen foods through the mail, so my family can just forget about
the lamb shanks. And you may have to wait days and days for
delivery. My Netgrocer order arrived 24 hours after I placed it,
but Peapod took four business days, or a total of six days,
including the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   And mail-order online grocers may not offer generic and store
brands. Since I typically buy inexpensive store brands of staples
like one-liter bottles of seltzer (49 cents), Peapod's mail-order
price of $1.19 for Schweppes seemed too much to pay for
convenience.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget to add the shipping fee: Netgrocer charged
$5.99 on an order that cost $26.13, and that increases with the
size of the order, depending on where you live, up to $73.99 for
orders of $800 or more. Peapod, which has a different distribution
system, charges a flat shipping rate of $7.95.
</P>
<P>
   Unpacking the orders from their big cardboard boxes, I was
delighted with how much more pleasant and convenient it was to have
groceries delivered to my doorstep than to drive to the store and
get them myself.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the selection offered by Peapod and Netgrocer, the
service was about the same, so yes, I would order again from both
companies _ particularly if I wanted to order a year's worth of
toilet paper, say, or arrange to have groceries shipped ahead to
the Nantucket cottage we rent each summer.
</P>
<P>
   Another plus: both companies also stock some hard-to-find cult
favorites like Quisp cereal (available from Netgrocer) and cans of
Ro-Tel Diced Tomatoes with Green Chili (at Peapod).
</P>
<P>
   But for dinner? I went to the supermarket _ where I avoided the
deli aisle.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the Berlin Wall fell on Nov. 9, 1989, it
pulled down with it the
</P>
<P>
   center of strategic gravity that had aligned the world's nations
and their people throughout half a century of Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, the United States has emerged as the single
strongest nation in history, capable of bringing to bear enormous,
and often decisive, influence and power on a truly global scale.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the old Soviet Union has sparked dizzying change
and spawned infinite possibilities for a whole generation of
American investors, interventionists and diplomats, who have spent
the past decade furiously tapping into new markets, confronting
humanitarian crises and weaving together alliances among former
foes.
</P>
<P>
   And the world, overall, is a very different place from the one
that was divided east and west along lines once symbolized by the
Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for all of the gains, real or perceived, of the past
decade, the forging of a new world order to replace the old remains
very much a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   For if the end of the Cold War created new opportunities for the
United States, it also presented the country with four
interconnected imperatives, the resolution of which, now far from
complete, will largely determine the shape of the world well into
the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
   In each of those areas _ managing the collapse of the Soviet
Union; reckoning with China's rise as an important world power;
reducing the threat of nuclear war; and building a global
marketplace _ progress has been limited and even threatens to
stall.
</P>
<P>
   Largely missing amid the celebration, self-congratulation and
talk of boundless potential that has come to characterize the age,
the world has arrived at a potentially dangerous moment, and the
path forward from here is anything but clear.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to fault President Clinton, as indeed many have done.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and his administration are great underachievers,'' said
Richard Haas, director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings
Institution, a Washington think tank. `` He has been president at a
time of unprecedented American primacy and we simply don't have
much to show for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House counters that there are real limits to what the
United States can accomplish, despite its over-arching political,
economic and military dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this view that the indispensable nation can affect
outcomes at every place around the world. We can't,'' said Anthony
Blinken, director for European Affairs on the White House National
Security Council. ``All we can do is bring these unique resources
to bear in the smartest way possible.''
</P>
<P>
   If the crumbling of the Berlin Wall signaled the beginning of
the end for the Soviet Union, the finale followed just two years
later, when Moscow dissolved its far flung empire.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. challenge was to try to help cushion the collapse of
the Soviet empire, in hopes of preventing anarchy, chaos and the
potential for war, all of which have since been visited upon the
Russian motherland in its peril-fraught journey from a communist
state toward a free-market democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a rocky, messy, suspenseful, even dangerous
process,'' President Clinton's Russia point man, Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott, said several weeks ago in a speech at
Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   The good news in Russia is that it remains, nominally at least,
under the control of its democratically elected president, Boris
Yeltsin. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for December. And
next June, if all goes as planned, Russians will go to the polls to
pick Yeltsin's successor in the first democratic transfer of power
in Russian history.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, though, possessor of more nuclear weapons than any other
nation on Earth, remains a deeply troubled state.
</P>
<P>
   It is listing through its fourth government in 18 months _
Yeltsin having sacked three others. Corruption, organized crime and
indebtedness have all but crippled Moscow's ability to provide the
services expected of a modern state. Soldiers and scientists alike
go unpaid, pensioners and entrepreneurs conspire to convert rubles
to deutsche marks, dollars or pounds, while tens of billions of
dollars in foreign aid and investment are believed to have been
siphoned off and spirited to banks and villas abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, Russia is engaged in a civil war with
seccessionists in the republic of Chechnya, a conflict that has
clouded and threatens to disrupt relations between Clinton and
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   While critics, indeed, blame Clinton for vesting excessive faith
in one man's vision of democratic reform _ Yeltsin's _ others plead
for patience and optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, keep your fingers crossed, Russia remains on the
democratic track,'' said Georgetown University professor of
government Thane Gustafson, author of the new book, ``Capitalism
Russian-Style.''
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. policy can influence and support Russia's painful
economic, political and social transition, he said, ultimately the
outcome is beyond outsiders' control.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're talking about here is a drama in Russian,'' said
Gustafson. ``It's a Russian passion play on a Russian stage with
Russian actors.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, U.S. efforts to reduce the global nuclear threat bore
fruit early on, only to stumble badly over the past 18 months and
cause the global non-proliferation regime has come under fire.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was unable to persuade India and Pakistan from testing a
series of nuclear weapons in a tit-or-tat display of atomic
ambitions in 1998. He was unable to prevent the
Republican-controlled Senate from spiking the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty, which would have prohibited such tests among 154
signatory states, last month. And he's been helpless against the
Russian Duma's refusal to ratify START II _ a treaty negotiated by
former President Bush and ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1996,
which calls for massive U.S. and Russian reductions in
nuclear-armed missiles.
</P>
<P>
   With a dozen nations believed to have nuclear capability, a
dozen other rogue states or well-organized terrorist groups seeking
to acquire them, and up to 70 other countries with the nuclear
expertise and equipment to build such weapons on short notice, the
threat of a nuclear attack has been anything but diminished since
the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would characterize it as a decade of unraveling,'' said
Michael Krepon, president of the Henry L. Stimson Center, a
nonpartisan research group that advocates nuclear non
proliferation. ``I don't know too many people who I work with in
this field who think that we're any safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, it's hard to point to concrete progress in relations
between the United States and China, the most populous nation on
Earth. With one-fifth of the world's people under its charge, China
is poised to assume a growing role as a regional and global
economic and military power over the coming decades.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton inherited poor relations with Beijing, taking office
less than four years after the brutal killings near Tiananmen
Square soured China's ties with most of the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the complexity and contradictions of China have made it
difficult for Clinton to find openings for meaningful detente.
</P>
<P>
   After U.S. bombs destroyed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last
June, Sino-American ties plunged to their lowest level since the
Tiananmen killings in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each country is more suspicious of the other today than it was
seven years ago,'' said Haas. As a result, he said, ``China has not
been effectively integrated into the world and there's growing
opposition in both countries, in the United States and China, to an
amicable relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   One key to China's entry into the company of global powers is
its growing economic might. With a total stock market
capitalization of roughly $250 billion and exports this year
approaching $200 billion, China continues to sit on the sidelines
of the formal club of trading nations, the World Trade
Organization, or WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton balked at a deal last spring that would have accorded
China WTO membership in exchange for a host of concessions on
Beijing's part - tariff reductions, investment protections and the
like. Now, against long political odds in this country and in
China, Clinton is trying to patch together a deal that would allow
China entry in time for a new round of WTO talks set to begin in
Seattle late this month.
</P>
<P>
   China's absence from the WTO is but one shortcoming in a
longer-term plan Clinton had once hoped would result in a collapse
in global trade barriers mirroring the fall of the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   Free-market economies have blossomed around the world, from
Latin America and Central Europe to Africa and Eastern Asia, since
the Cold War's end. Hundreds of millions of people have profited:
an estimated 1.5 billion now live in countries where a family of
four enjoys an average annual income of $20,000 a more.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton's pleas for a free trade zone taking in the
entire Western Hemisphere have been thwarted by his fellow
Democrats, in the face of opposition from organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the matter of China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some controlled integration of China into the world market
economy and its institutions is very important,'' said Robert
Hormats, of the New York investment firm Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very hard to have a stable and prosperous
system,'' said Hormats, ``if China is not brought into it over the
course of the next few years.''

CITY SITES FOR YEAR 2000: A MIXED BAG 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps it is just another sign of growing confidence that the
nation will sail into next year with few serious computer date
problems. Maybe the money is needed elsewhere. Or could it be
old-fashioned incompetence?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, as the nation enters the last few weeks
before computers start the Year 2000 rollovers, local government
Web sites dealing with Y2K problems are all too frequently riddled
with bland assurances, impenetrable status reports and out-of-date
news releases. If citizens take the quality of the sites as
barometers of how seriously the governments have taken the tasks of
repairing glitches and making contingency plans, many are likely to
be more nervous when they sign off than when they logged on.
</P>
<P>
   New York City's home page (www.ci.nyc.ny.us) is one of the few
without even a direct link to its Year 2000 report. Visitors who
click on the NYC 2000 logo are taken to a separate site dealing
with New Year's Eve party plans. Still worse, if they click on the
link to Y2K information on that page, they are jumped to a dead-end
site telling them they have an out-of-date address.
</P>
<P>
   Those who eventually realize that the entry point to the Y2K
pages is buried in the Services and Agencies directory end up with
a decidedly mixed bag. The section on testing criteria is among the
most thorough available in the public or private sectors but too
laden with jargon to be user-friendly. The most recent overview is
a financial disclosure statement issued in June.
</P>
<P>
   Aging information is an almost universal problem. Boston
(www.ci.boston.ma.us) informs visitors in a report from last May
that it has ``recently'' finished its search for computers embedded
in traffic lights and other systems. An outside consultant told the
city that in one out of four cases, it either needed more
information or must replace such embedded systems, but there is no
report on what happened after that. Another page has a Year 2000
project timeline that ended last July 1, the target date for
completion of repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, one of the cities often reported to be in the most
precarious state, apparently assumes its site has visitors. It
updates status reports on its agencies weekly.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Lubbock, Texas, hailed as a preparedness pioneer
when it ran a Y2K drill last year, is so relaxed that it displays
its city manager's testimony to Congress on Oct. 2, 1998, in
``recent events.''
</P>
<P>
   At least these sites are legible. The busy, darkly-patterned
background on Houston's page produces instantaneous eye-strain.
``It's ridiculous,'' agreed Don Payne, a spokesman for Mayor Lee
Brown. ``It's going to be changed in the next week to 10 days.''

<P>
   Everyone has opinions about television sex and violence, and
opinions about the technology to block it, the V-chip, run equally
strong. To the Clinton administration, the V-chip is a triumph of
technology that allows parents to keep material that runs contrary
to their tastes or beliefs from being viewed by their children. To
others, the V-chip is government interference that falls only
slightly short of censorship.
</P>
<P>
   But to television set manufacturers, the V-chip is a bit of a
nuisance. On July 1, the Federal Communications Commission required
that half of all new sets with screens larger than 13 inches
include technology that lets consumers block programs based on
their content. On Jan. 1, all sets that big will be subject to the
rule.
</P>
<P>
   The V-chip had its beginnings in 1990, when Congress passed two
acts aimed at regulating the television industry. The Television
Violence Act declared that broadcasters would not violate antitrust
laws if they worked together to reduce violence on television, and
the Television Decoder Circuitry Act mandated that within three
years, television receivers should be capable of decoding signals
for closed-captioning. In those three years, an industry task force
and the communications commission worked to establish
specifications for transmitting and decoding data. The approaches
went beyond closed-captioning and were based on a broadcasting
feature called the vertical blanking interval.
</P>
<P>
   Television pictures are transmitted as lines of information that
are drawn across the screen by cathode-ray guns in the picture
tube. The vertical blanking interval, part of every television
picture, is a few empty lines broadcast at the end of every frame
so the cathode-ray guns can return to the top of the screen to
start drawing the next frame. Since the interval contains no
picture information, it has bandwidth to spare.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that bandwidth is set aside for closed-captioning, but
that still leaves plenty of bandwidth. In the 1970s, the British
Broadcasting Corporation and the Independent Broadcasting
Association in Britain began using the extra bandwidth to supply
interactive text-based news and weather services, called Ceefax and
Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, part of the blanking interval was set
aside to carry program identification information, schedules and
emergency broadcast functions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the Television Violence Reduction Through Parental
Empowerment Act was passed, and the term V-chip was introduced. To
comply with the act, broadcasters could opt to transmit ratings for
all programs (except sports and news) on the blanking interval, and
V-chips would be included in new television sets and set-top boxes
to interpret the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of the Motion Picture Association of America and
cable and network broadcasters came up with a set of ratings in
January 1997. The system has six categories: TV-Y, TV-Y7, TV-G,
TV-PG, TV-14 and TV-M. The two Y ratings designate programs for
young children; TV-G is for general audiences, and TV-PG calls for
parental guidance for children. TV-14 indicates shows for those 14
and older, and TV-M is for mature audiences.
</P>
<P>
   By programming a V-chip to reject shows with a particular
rating, parents block all programs in that group. But the broad
ratings have subdivisions that indicate whether a show includes
violence (graphic violence or cartoonlike fantasy violence), sexual
content, strong language or suggestive dialogue. It is possible to
block programs rated TV-14 because of violence but allow those
given the rating for profanity. The V-chip can also block broadcast
movies that carry a Motion Picture Association of America rating _
G through NC-17 _ although the movie ratings are not subdivided to
indicate whether a show has profanity or sexual content.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the first television sets with V-chips were
demonstrated in June 1998, the television ratings, the transmission
standard and most of the television networks and cable companies
were ready. With only a few months remaining before most new
television sets must contain the chips, manufacturers like
Panasonic and Zilog are cranking them out to meet demand.
</P>
<P>
   The system is clever, but it is not perfect. The chips are
hard-wired to recognize signals in specific places in the blanking
interval. If the ratings system changes substantially, or if
broadcasters choose not to adopt the voluntary ratings scheme,
violent content can still make it past the V-chip. And since sports
and news broadcasts are exempt from ratings, parental control over
viewing is limited, although most television sets that include
V-chips also allow the blocking of whole channels. A parent who is
so inclined can pick up the remote control and block CNN and ESPN.

LIKE ATHLETES, WORKERS NEED CONDITIONING FOR COMPUTER JOBS

Dr. O. Alton Barron is a physician at the C.V. Starr Hand Surgery
Center at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. 
 By O. ALTON BARRON, M.D.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Almost every day now, I see one or two patients with
pain in their upper limbs that they attribute to their use of
computers at work. These patients are usually young and quite
healthy, but they have a look of apprehension, some fear of the
unknown and an overly gentle handshake, as if I might damage them
further with a simple greeting. But since they are often on their
ever-more-truncated lunch hours, they waste no time beginning their
story _ a story I am hearing with an alarmingly increasing
frequency.
</P>
<P>
   They tell me there was a time when they could ``pull an
all-nighter'' typing a 30-page term paper and then work the next
day at their part-time computer programming job and never look
back. So what gives? They say they have tried rubbing and soaking,
herbs and acupuncture, but they still have persistent forearm,
wrist and hand pain.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these individuals thought it could not happen to them,
but many can be classified as neo-workaholics bred of the
information age. Many have accepted jobs with start-up Internet
companies that commandeer their lightning-fast fingers to increase
revenues and send their IPO stock prices soaring 800 percent in the
first nanosecond.
</P>
<P>
   They are often desperate when they come to see me at the C.V.
Starr Hand Surgery Center in Manhattan. Their hands, the foundation
of their livelihoods and well-being, are in pain, and they feel
vulnerable and frightened. They have heard horror stories about
others who have lost the use of a hand after the onset of mild
symptoms similar to what they are experiencing. I ask them
questions, and they tell me their story.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long have you had the pain in your forearms?''
</P>
<P>
   ``About two months.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever felt anything like this before?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe once or twice in college, around finals, but it just
went away in a day or two.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you had any specific injuries?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No. Do I have carpal tunnel syndrome?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem likely based on your symptoms. Are you
otherwise healthy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess so, but I'm beginning to wonder. Am I just starting to
fall apart now that I'm over 30? Is it downhill from here?'' (I
reassure them that this is by no means the case.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Has there been any significant change in your work habits?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I changed jobs three or four months ago. I mostly just
type at a computer, probably 6 to 8 hours a day, unless a deadline
is near, then it's more like 10 or 12. At my old job, it was more
like 3 or 4 hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you exercise regularly?''
</P>
<P>
   ``With this new job? There's no time. By the way, would you mind
writing a note to my gym explaining why I haven't been able to work
out since the symptoms came on? That's the only way they'll believe
me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you feel any numbness, tingling or pins and needles in your
hands?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really, just some strange sensations that move around, run
up my arm. Are you sure I don't have carpal tunnel syndrome?''
</P>
<P>
   Their physical examinations are usually remarkable for the
 &UR; absence &LR;  of findings that point to common upper limb problems.
There may be some tenderness in the forearm muscles, mild stiffness
when bending the wrist in each direction and some pain with
forceful grip. The most notable finding is a weakness of grip and a
weakened ability to pinch.
</P>
<P>
   The diagnosis is overuse strain, and it can threaten one's
psychological, physical and financial health. It is not carpal
tunnel syndrome or whatever the latest Internet chat room or
late-night television commercial may be claiming to have discovered
the cure for. Patients have been assaulted with so much news (and I
use the term loosely) invoking such disquieting terms _ like RSI
and OSHA and CTS (carpal tunnel syndrome) and CMV (cytomegalovirus,
of chronic fatigue fame) _ that they can only imagine the worst. A
simple, readily explicable and treatable problem becomes distorted,
and the patient suffers.
</P>
<P>
   Overuse strain appears in all facets of life. When a formerly
serious runner decides to return to running after a year's layoff,
he or she is at great risk. This gung-ho Type A in new Nikes runs
19 days straight, and then the shin splints, Achilles tendonitis
and knee strain, topped off with a dollop of sciatica, sets in,
bringing the runner painfully back to earth. It is clear that the
would-be athlete simply went too far too fast. What happens when
people do the spring cleaning after a long, cold winter of
discontent? They ache all over and start popping ibuprofen and
begging for massages.
</P>
<P>
   In the workplace, overuse strain has the same origin, as people
alter their use patterns enough to take their limbs beyond a
previously adequate level of conditioning. That often seems due to
the patients' own dedication to their work and their employer as
well as external pressures to maintain high productivity and meet
deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   I find the phrase ``repetitive stress injury'' problematic.
Professional violinists, percussionists and other musicians can
play several hours per day for decades without sustaining such
``injuries'' _ if they avoid abruptly pushing beyond their level of
conditioning. The large typing pools of decades past seem to have
been largely free of endemic typewriter-induced RSI. That is
logical because these typists did the same work all day, every day,
leaving them well conditioned and at less risk for overuse strain.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, our society's excessive work ethic and unrealistic
deadlines leave many people much more susceptible to injury. By
implicating the computer mouse or keyboard, per se, we entirely
miss the point. Ergonomic office evaluations are certainly
valuable, but they should not supersede efforts to educate
employers and employees about the causes of overuse strain and to
encourage work habits that minimize the risks for such a problem.
</P>
<P>
   What to do? Naturally, people in pain should see doctors and not
try to diagnose their own problems. And they should do it quickly.
As with many medical conditions, early detection means an earlier
cure. Usually, a problem only gets worse with time.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid ending up in pain, one of the most important things to
do is avoid large fluctuations in the number of hours spent each
day or week at the computer. And be aware that job stress, and the
resulting changes in posture and muscle tension, can have a real
effect on your body. Many patients have told me that the force with
which they grip their mouse is directly proportional to their
stress level.
</P>
<P>
   Through experience, we come to expect that our shoulders and
arms will be sore after painting the ceiling of the family room or
moving furniture on a weekend. Through education, not
sensationalism, in the workplace, on the streets and in the press,
we can begin to recognize when we are putting ourselves at risk for
overuse strain and take actions to prevent that.

   &UR; Sega Bass Fishing, for Dreamcast, $39.95; all ages; fishing
controller, sold separately, $34.95. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The promotional materials for Sega's new Bass Fishing game for
Dreamcast promise ``the sensation of sport fishing in an expansive
3-D virtual lake _ one minute you're sitting on your couch waiting
patiently for a tug at your lure, then BAM! You're standing on the
edge of your boat with a bass tugging madly on your hook! To make
things even more realistic, the fish are hyper-intuitive. Sunlight
reflections bounce perfectly off ripples in the lake, as
realistically rendered wiggling fish, complete with blank stares
and moving gills, swim about in the lake's murky depths, testing
your ability to `lure' them in.''
</P>
<P>
   But when there's a piece of code on one side of the screen and a
human being wrestling madly on the other, it's not clear who's
being hooked. There is a live thing attracted to an artificial
thing. You're the live thing. Ostensibly, you're the angler. But
there are many eerie moments when you feel like the bass.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the environmental lures are so pretty. Once the line
is cast, you have a spectacular underwater view, transforming the
mundane fish-catching process into a Jacques Cousteau expedition.
And the fish themselves are incredibly alluring _ beautifully
fashioned bait for the wild and wiley gamer.
</P>
<P>
   They bite. But then, so do you. When you feel a tug on the other
end of a force-feedback fishing reel, you're hooked. As in fishing,
there is a frisson associated with that event. Frankly, the ``I've
got a bite!'' moment is surreal in a virtual environment. We've had
force feedback forever _ vibrations triggered by impact or
explosions, moving images that push you. But it's radically
different when you're being pulled. It conjures all kinds of sci-fi
fantasies about being sucked into the screen.
</P>
<P>
   That's something we're afraid of. It's also something we want _
to plunge through the surface and tussle with whatever is lurking
underneath. That's why virtual reality is appealing as a concept.
(In practice VR's appeal, like that of fishing, is tempered by the
prospect of motion sickness.) That's the drama of ``The Matrix'' or
``Tron,'' or ``Moby Dick'' for that matter. Ultimately, it's about
landing the Big One, at risk of life or limb.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Sega Bass Fishing, it's risk of limb. You grip
the controller in your left hand while you turn the reel with your
right hand. (There is no left-hand version.) And every time you
combat one of those monster bass, the rod sends vibrations up and
down your arm. After a marathon fishing session, you've got a
pretty acute case of tennis elbow. The manual warns you not to play
for more than 30 minutes. I required painkillers after an hour.
Your mileage may vary.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming your tendons survive the showdown, your prize specimens
are weighed and ranked (Small, Medium One, Big One or Huge) and
your name is entered in the Big Bass Ranking List. Again, it's not
clear who's the trophy. It's your name and data up on the board _
in some sense, the players are hung above the mantel.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the game utterly fails to provide the social context
that makes fishing such a hallowed institution. You can't fish with
another player on the same console _ there's no two-player mode.
And despite the Dreamcast's much touted connectivity, there is no
attempt to make this game a communal experience. In the arcade,
Sega Bass Fishing is a performance sport _ everyone gathers around
to watch whoever is wrestling the fish on screen. There is
discussion. There is backseat driving. It's a social event.
</P>
<P>
   If there was ever a leisure activity that mandated conversation,
it's fishing, but there is no online chat capability. There are no
networked tournaments that allow remote contestants to fish from
the same digital lake. None of your rankings are posted on the
Internet. You can't even tell virtual fish stories online. This is
supposed to be a revolutionary networked game console. Where are
the downloadable lures? Why are we fishing by ourselves?
</P>
<P>
   The other technology that Sega likes to brag about is its visual
memory unit (VMU), the Tomagotchi-like keychain toy that plugs in
to the game pad. A cross between Nintendo's Gameboy and a
Playstation memory card, the VMU is designed to give console games
a portable dimension. Bass Fishing ignores this hardware capability
as well. There's no mini-game, no portable tackle box or pocket
bass farm. With regard to Bass Fishing, the VMU is a red herring
(sorry).
</P>
<P>
   Throw it back.

 &HT;    RENO, EPA ANNOUNCE POWER PLANT POLLUTION SUITS
 &HT;    Moving in Washington (w) and Financial (f) categories.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - The federal government filed lawsuits against seven
of the country's largest electric utility companies Wednesday for
making ``unlawful modifications'' to old coal-powered generating
plants, leading to hundreds of thousands of tons of air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno and Carol Browner, administrator of
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), said at a press
conference the companies had taken illegal advantage of exemptions
Congress gave the plants when it passed the Clean Air Act over two
decades ago under the assumption they would be phased out of
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Browner said, owners ``spent hundreds of millions of
dollars modifying these plants, increasing their life and
increasing their pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   The suits were filed in Atlanta, Indianapolis, Tampa, Fla., East
St. Louis, Ill., and Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Affected are 17 plants in Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Alabama,
Indiana, Ohio and West Virginia. In a separate legal action, the
government accused its own Tennessee Valley Authority of similar
violations at seven plants in Alabama, Tennessee and Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   TVA and the private utility companies that operate the targeted
plants failed to comply with obligations to ``come forward,''
disclose the modifications and seek state permits, Browner said. As
a result, she said, they evaded the requirement to install ``best
available technology'' air pollution control equipment.
</P>
<P>
   She said the legal actions were the result of ``one of the
largest investigations in the history of EPA, launched two years
ago and still ongoing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not close calls,'' Browner said. ``Next year, these
utilities will dump into the air 2.2 million tons of sulfur
dioxide, which causes acid rain, and 660,000 tons of smog-producing
nitrogen oxides.''
</P>
<P>
   The action followed by six weeks an annoucement by New York
Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer that he would sue many of the
same plants under the same law. Spitzer had to give two months'
notice before he could file suit. The two-month period ends Nov.
15.
</P>
<P>
   However, Frank O'Donnell, director of the Clean Air Trust, an
environmental group, said he did not believe EPA was following the
lead of officials in New York, which has long claimed that much of
its air pollution originates in Midwest power plants. O'Donnell
said he had been aware of the ongoing EPA investigation leading up
to the suits for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell praised the action as ``a very postive step.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If these plants cleaned up tomorrow, you would immediately
start to see far fewer deaths, far fewer asthma attacks and far
fewer other cases of respiratory disease,'' he said. He added that
if well-designed ``scrubbers'' had been installed at the plants,
they would be removing 95 percent of the sulfur dioxide pollution.
Corresponding technology would remove the other pollutants to a
similar degree, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Patricio Silva, Midwest coordinator of the Natural Resources
Defense Council, said the action was long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   He said his organization and numerous smaller environmental
groups in the South and Midwest had urged EPA for years to ``take a
look at some of these power plant modifications.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida plants cited in the complaints were Tampa Electric Co.'s
Big Bend and Gannon plants in Tampa. The Crist Power Plant, which
is operated in Florida by the Southern Co., was served a ``notice
of violation'' by EPA and could be sued later, Browner said.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio plants against which complaints were filed were the
Cardinal Plant in Brilliant, the Muskingum River Plant in Beverly,
both owned by American Electric Power; the Beckjord Plant in New
Richmond, owned by Cinergy, and First Energy's Sammis Plant in
Jefferson County. Notices of violation were issued to Cinergy's
Wabash River Plant and American Electric Power's Conesville Plant.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Co.'s Bowen Plant in Cartersville, Ga., and Scherer
Plant in Macon, Ga., are defendents in the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The other two firms sued were Illinois Power and Southern
Indiana Gas &AMP; Electric.

DIGITAL BRAIN MAKES CONNECTIONS IN PATTERN RECOGNITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANNE EISENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ability to recognize patterns _ the way noses tend to appear
in the middle of faces, how words like ``throw'' are often
associated with ``curve ball'' and ``touchdown pass'' _ has always
been associated with human intelligence. Not necessarily high
intelligence, but something that machines have a hard time with.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of investigating how the brain might accomplish
such impressive feats, two physicists have devised a novel bit of
programming that can recognize the existence of patterns, although
it cannot yet figure out what they mean.
</P>
<P>
   Their creation, a learning algorithm, may one day inspire not
only better searches on the Web, but also wide-ranging improvements
in computer applications like voice recognition and medical imaging
and other applications that call for a computer to parse a mass of
complex data.
</P>
<P>
   The algorithm, a math-based strategy, was developed by Dr.
Sebastian Seung, an assistant professor in computational
neuroscience at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Dr.
Daniel Lee, a researcher in the biological computation department
at Bell Labs, the research and development arm of Lucent
Technologies in Murray Hill, N.J. Their account appears in the Oct.
21 issue of the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our method seeks to imitate the way in which we think the
brain uses patterns to make sense of the world,'' Seung said.
</P>
<P>
   The two physicists, part of the community of scientists working
on the border of artificial intelligence and neuroscience, tested
their learning algorithm with images and with words. For images,
they gave it pictures of faces. For words, the algorithm was
provided with encyclopedia articles. The job was the same: to find
recurring pieces of text or images and put them into groups.
</P>
<P>
   The algorithm works by the statistical analysis of words or
pixels that occur together and that may therefore be related. For
faces, the algorithm looked for pixels that repeatedly popped up
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not looking specifically for noses but for repeated
patterns,'' Seung said. ``We didn't explain about noses.'' On its
own the program came up with groups that quite visibly resembled
noses, mouths or other features constituting identifiable facial
parts.
</P>
<P>
   For text, the algorithm grouped words like flower, leaves, plant
and perennial together. Once the groups were created, the
researchers labeled them as belonging to a topic, like botany.
</P>
<P>
   The method for identifying images of facial parts or topics in
text relied on using the algorithm to analyze huge amounts of data:
volumes of an encyclopedia and thousands of faces. ``It's
surprising what you can discover about meaning from statistics,
that is, essentially from what gets used together,'' Seung said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee emphasized that the researchers' learning algorithm worked
without supervision. They did not tell the algorithm which features
constituted a face, for instance, or where to look for items that
might belong in the category ``botany.'' ``Much of human learning
is done without a teacher around,'' Lee said. ``We wanted an
algorithm that could in an unsupervised fashion recognize
correlations.''
</P>
<P>
   An artificial-intelligence expert, Dr. Geoffrey Hinton, director
of the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit of University
College, London, said Seung and Lee's approach was an important
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a novel way of taking large data sets and automatically
finding features,'' Hinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach may also lead to valuable information on how
the brain extracts features from images, Hinton said. People can
become very good at doing that, he said, using as an example
someone who was an expert reader of X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   ``People learn over several years to see details in X-rays that
they could not initially perceive,'' Hinton said. But it is not
clear how the brain works to increase this skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we understand how the brain extracts different
features,'' Hinton added, ``we can make computer vision systems
that are better at interpreting medical images.''
</P>
<P>
   At AT&AMP;T Laboratories in Florham Park, N.J., Dr. Fernando
Pereira, head of machine learning and information retrieval
research, confronts problems related not to how the brain processes
images but to how it handles language. ``This is an important
advance,'' he said of the new approach. ``It brings together two
seemingly separate areas _ images and language _ and shows that
they can be subsumed under one single model.''
</P>
<P>
   Pereira, an expert in language processing, said one of the most
challenging problems in the field was determining how people learn
certain cues that help them understand language.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children learning language may draw from words and sentences
in context to get meaning, plus they also have other cues from
seeing and hearing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Computers, in contrast, do not yet have this rich sensory
capability to draw on when confronted with the language used in
daily life.
</P>
<P>
   Like Lee and Seung, Pereira analyzes acres of text, using
statistical methods to find indicators of the meaning that words
have in context.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we build better models of how the underlying structures of
speech and text are learned,'' he said, ``we can apply them to
speech recognition and information retrieval.''
</P>
<P>
   Pereira avoids the word ``understand'' when he talks about the
models he is developing that help computers handle human speech and
text.
</P>
<P>
   ``My work is in having computers process and react appropriately
to natural-language speech and text,'' he said. ``The term
`understanding' turns out to be too controversial. I'm settling for
`react more appropriately.'''

MULTIMEDIA MINE OF BLACK HISTORY AND CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHEL MARRIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENCARTA AFRICANA 2000 (Microsoft; $69.95 without $30 rebate;
Windows 95 and 98.
</P>
<P>
   How often do you need a new encyclopedia? In the good old days
of paper-bound encyclopedias, families might buy one in a lifetime.
With today's electronic encyclopedias, they're expected to ante up
every year or so.
</P>
<P>
   The latest example of an updated electronic encyclopedia is
Encarta Africana 2000, a smartly reworked version of the
breakthrough reference CD-ROMs covering black culture and history
from Microsoft. Almost a year after the original Encarta Africana,
named after the print project to chronicle global black history
started by W.E.B. Du Bois, was released only last January. The new
version is arriving in stores in time for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Kwame Anthony Appiah, a Harvard University professor and
co-editor of the Africana encyclopedias, said work on the update
began before the first version was released. ``We had a couple of
things we really wanted to do,'' Appiah said, like adding rare
audio snippets of speeches made by Marcus Garvey and Booker T.
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some of Microsoft's other recent software updates, this
one seems worth the second effort.
</P>
<P>
   When the encyclopedia's home page loads, the differences become
clear. First, its search and cross-index system has been redesigned
to comply with the style and approach used by Microsoft's flagship
Encarta Reference Suite 2000. They are less cryptic and more
intuitive to use than the old user interface.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you typed in Martin Luther King Jr. in the old
finder box, a picture of him would appear above an article about
him and his work. There would also be a list noting headings of
other articles as well as symbols indicating pictures, audio and
video clips of King available on the disks.
</P>
<P>
   The new Africana shows an outline of articles on King, a list of
related articles, a list of Web links, an article King wrote for
The Nation in 1965, plus an offering of video and still images that
slide across the top of the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, Africana 2000 has 500 more articles (for a total of
more than 3,600), with 300 more Web links (for a total of 800), and
about 7 million more words than the original encyclopedia that
contained 2.5 million words.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the new material can be found in an expansive new
feature called the Library of Black America, a 6.3 million-word
collection of articles, novels, poetry, slave narratives and
nonfiction works.
</P>
<P>
   All of the material, including a series biographical articles Du
Bois wrote for Crisis magazine, are searchable by names and topics.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent event sponsored by the New York Institute of
Technology, Henry Louis Gates Jr., chairman of Afro-American
studies at Harvard and co-editor of the Encarta Africana series,
said that part of the solution to ``cybersegregation,'' was
providing content that would draw blacks to the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Extolling the updated version, he noted that the Grammy-award
winning singer and hip-hop artist Lauryn Hill was included on a new
interactive black music timeline stretching back to the Fisk
Jubilee Singers in the late 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   The range and immediacy of many of the entries is stunning. The
new multimedia timelines _ depicting ancient black history, the
civil rights movement and black music _ are far more engaging than
any in the original Africana. There is also an extraordinary video
clip of the jazz pioneers Miles Davis and John Coltrane that could
not be obtained in time for the first Africana. The new Africana
also offers closed-captioning for people with hearing impairments,
and selected passages can be heard with a built-in text-to-speech
feature.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, the makers of Encarta Africana 2000 made some smart
choices. The predecessor received some stinging criticism by
Africentric historians like Dr. Molefi Kete Asante, who was hardly
mentioned in the first Africana. In the new version, Asante
contributes a 10,000-word article on Afrocentricity.
</P>
<P>
   But like the first Africana, this one would be much easier to
use if all the data was placed on a single DVD disc rather than
twin CD-ROM discs. With two discs, users are frequently asked to
disrupt their research to swap discs in their computers. This
becomes most aggravating when exploring the encyclopedia's
multimedia offerings, like the expanded virtual tours, Africana on
Camera, which are canned presentations by the likes of Colin Powell
and Quincy Jones of historic sites in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In a video clip welcome to the disks with Gates, Appiah sums up
the journey through Encarta Africana 2000: ``Along the way you'll
meet rulers and writers, generals and journalists, politicians and
musicians, saints and scientists, artists and athletes, the
forbearers of the African people today and those to whom the legacy
has been bequeathed.''

 By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the more than 25 years they've been married,
Steven and Judith O'Connor have moved 18 times. They have lived in
a small nondescript apartment in Iran with a Turkish toilet and in
a heavily shuttered home in Athens, shortly after the collapse of
the military regime. Then there was the cedar-paneled house
overlooking a sound in Bermuda, the tile-roofed hacienda in Phoenix
and the Provencal-suburban manor in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, just a honk from the Holland Tunnel, they're putting
down roots, in a loft building in TriBeCa. But for the first time,
the couple say, they're in terra incognita, a landscape mapped by
architects. Where once they traveled freely with little more than
what they could stow under an airplane seat, now their roots are
planted in blue Brazilian granite, laminated glass and blackened
steel plate.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling stones they may be, but they have brought plenty of moss
to this new frontier of bold, sleek architecture: personal penates
and mementos, gathered over years of wandering. In the absence of a
permanent residence, it was their things _ Oaxacan clay figurines,
Persian carpets, a whirlwind of blown glass by the artist Dale
Chihuly _ that defined them. At last, they were ready for a space
of their own, but they didn't want it to be a curio cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   They were ready _ but not prepared _ when Adam Yarinsky and
Stephen Cassell of the downtown firm Architecture Research Office,
offered a vision. In Yarinsky's words, it was of a wide open space
responding to ``the daily and seasonal cycles of the sun, where
materials, not walls would create limits.''
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the entrance isn't even a door. Instead, a massive
5-by-8-foot pivoting panel of steel, acid-washed and waxed to a
blackened sheen, sweeps open to reveal at a glance 4,000 square
feet of open floor surrounded on all sides by windows and
punctuated by three operatic gestures: a glass-and-steel staircase,
a towering wall of blue Bahia granite and a three-story atrium of
translucent glass.
</P>
<P>
   Was the marriage of these color-loving, stuff-hoarding world
travelers and these spare-leaning, Adolf Loos-talking Modernist
architects a union made in heaven or a case study for ``Can This
Marriage Be Saved?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted a place that when I woke up in the morning and walked
around, I'd see something different every time,'' O'Connor said.
``I wanted a space that would get me thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Steven and Judith O'Connor would not appear to be
likely clients for Type A architecture. He's a burly guy who wears
plaid shirts to work and likes to shoot pool and watch hockey games
with his 14-year-old son. Now 48, he started out as an
alternative-school teacher but switched, midcareer, to the
financial world and made enough money to be able to afford an
apartment costing upward of $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, who trained as a graphic designer, has a craftsman's
love of the handmade and a pack rat's tendency to accumulate. She
abhors e-mail, and in the morning can be found dressed in
voluminous print skirts and sensible rubber shoes, sitting at the
kitchen counter writing letters in longhand. She is the first to
admit that her aesthetic and that of her architects are somewhat at
odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's from years of being in Iran, where the mosques and
the bazaars dazzle you with so much visual texture and intricate
patterning, but I like lots of color and a bit of a clutter,'' said
Ms. O'Connor, 47. ``I'm not bothered by stuff, and I know how that
drives architects crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Yarinsky and Cassell wouldn't disagree, but they are
professionals. ``Some clients want everything dictated to them,''
Yarinsky said, diplomatically. ``We appreciate whichever way people
choose to live.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan architects met while apprentice designers in the
office of Steven Holl and set up their own firm five years ago.
Their diverse clients range from Biotherm, the cosmetics company,
to the Pentagon, for which they built the recruiting station that
reopened this fall in Times Square, to the Cooper-Hewitt museum
(they designed the 1997 Henry Dreyfuss exhibition). Cassell, 36,
and Yarinsky, 37, have established themselves as the kind of young
architects _ brainy and modern but not afraid of their inner
sensualists _ that everyone wants on the short list for new
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Color was a sticking point. The homeowners wanted more; the
architects said that less was more. Ms. O'Connor recalls: ``I kept
telling Adam: `This is too bland, this is too blank. I know what
you're going for, but I need more interest when I look at
something.'''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Brazilian blue wall with its bold black veins, the yellow
silk curtain wall in the bedroom, the red-and-silver screening
room, the grass-green rug (not yet installed), and the cobalt,
turquoise and gold glass bathroom tiles, Yarinsky said only: ``It's
true. I'm more of a minimalist than they are.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple came to the project with their eyes wide open. ``We
knew in going in to build a modern apartment that they're
complicated, they're difficult and they require different kinds of
space,'' O'Connor said. ``And this particular house has a striking
architectural feel. Glass, steel, marble _ those are pretty cold
materials if you come to think of it. That made Judy more nervous
than me. That was the single biggest issue _ to design a place not
to look and feel like a museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Connor still chafes in recalling the story of the delivery
man who stepped off the elevator and exclaimed: ``Wow, some
gallery! Is it yours?'' There's no denying that the main space does
have the commanding scale and hard surfaces of a public venue _
that is, until you notice the little bowls of peanut butter candy,
the pool table and the snow dome on the window sill.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that travel to the sun-drenched climes of Iran, Greece
and even the Southwest had made their clients lovers of natural
light, the architects laid the oak floor in diagonal segments _
call it marquetry moderne _ that track the path of the sun through
the apartment from dawn till dusk. (Their cat does its part as a
kind of ambulatory sundial as it picks its spot for naps.)
</P>
<P>
   They placed the couple's bedroom to the east, where its interior
walls are the translucent glass of the atrium light well. (As a
result, the bedroom is so bright that Ms. O'Connor has trouble
sleeping in on weekends, even with silk curtains.)
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen, hidden behind the Miesian blue wall, has become the
couple's favorite place to sit, take their meals and enjoy the view
of their home. Out in the middle of the space, a dining table for
one of their previous residences made by Terence Main, a New York
artist, is more sculptural than practical. ``The chairs remind me
of something out of `Beetlejuice,''' Ms. O'Connor said of the
bronze-ribbed seats that each weigh at least 50 pounds. ``They're
more comfortable than you'd think, but they aren't exactly for
lounging.''
</P>
<P>
   The late afternoon sun settles in the far corner of the loft, in
the area designated as the library. The corner is paneled in
mahoghany-toned bubinga wood, but the cabinetry holds a 30-inch
television set, not books.
</P>
<P>
   It took a pool table to stir up some action. ``These modern
houses can be static,'' O'Connor said. ``You can admire a blue wall
_ you can't interact with it.'' The pool table invites people in to
play. ``People can't just stand by and look at it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   He also pointed out a whimsical chandelier by the German
designer Ingo Maurer, made of note paper skewered on long wires,
some scribbled with notes and some blank. The couple have filled in
a few with poems by Yeats and E.E. Cummings.
</P>
<P>
   The glass-and-steel stairway plays a double role, as sculpture
and passage to the roof. The architects decided to make it a real
prima donna. Steel and wood treads appear to float down from the
sky, steadied, almost invisibly, by clear sheets of thick glass, a
feat of engineering (worked out by Guy Nordenson) so unusual that
it was featured in trade magazines even before it was finished.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Connor wasn't impressed _ not, that is, until the
handrail, an eel-like swerve of bead-blasted stainless steel, was
put in. ``At first, it was too angular and linear for me,'' she
said. ``The railing made all the difference. It's softer now, more
human.''
</P>
<P>
   The spirited, even sportsmanlike, tug of war between clients and
architects seems to have been relished by both parties, without
converting either. A few weeks after the owners moved in, an
employee from the architects' office surveyed the space _ from the
tweaked-up modern ``Chinese ancestor portraits'' by Larry Yung to
the upright Victorian music box to the papier-mache dog's head _
and uttered a sentiment heard frequently by anyone who has ever
conversed with architects: ``It was so beautiful when it was
empty.''

ONLINE FANS OF `X-FILES' KNOW IT'S THE CLOTHES THAT MAKE THE SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget the aliens and the sinister government conspiracy. Now
that the heart of the extraterrestrial plot has been revealed on
``The X-Files,'' fans are chatting online less about the show's
intricate story lines and subtle details and more about what the
two lead characters are wearing.
</P>
<P>
   Gillian Anderson's character, Special Agent Dana Scully of the
FBI, who is often confidently dressed in sleek business suits by
Calvin Klein and Emporio Armani, has garnered particular attention.
There have been many posts on the Usenet newsgroup alt.tv.x-files
with some variation on the subject line ``Scully's Clothes'' that
contemplate the sartorial, from casual comments to shades of deeper
meaning. The appearance of the character in a light-colored linen
dress in the final scene of the season cliffhanger last spring
brought many comments from Web and Usenet fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of people saying that with this whole past
season's suits, she's been wearing a lot of black, really somber,''
Lesley Banez, a fan of the show, said. ``And suddenly at the very
end, she's in a light suit, so I don't know if that's going to be a
herald of change for the next season.'' Ms. Banez runs a small Web
site called the Scullywear Auxiliary Brigade
(members.aol.com/scullywear) that dedicates itself to the
celebration of Special Agent Scully's wardrobe. Two hundred fans
have joined the brigade and the site has registered more than
15,000 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Many fan-run Web sites offer loads of images, sounds and clips
taken from the show for fans to download. This tends to invite a
cease-and-desist letter from the Fox Network's legal department,
which has shown concern that the homemade tributes infringe on
copyrighted material and detract from the show's official Web site,
www.x-files.com.
</P>
<P>
   But the Scullywear site is a straightforward affair, focusing on
original commentary about the clothes and where they can be
purchased. There is also an episode guide that chronicles the
clothing scene by scene. ``Back at the Bureau on Monday morning,
she looks great in a pearl gray suit with a white V-neck blouse,''
reads an entry about Special Agent Scully in ``Chinga,'' a
fifth-season episode.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh _ and possibly final _ season begins Nov. 7, and for
those who have been wondering since the summer about the real
meaning of Special Agent Scully's outfit in the cliffhanger, Molly
Harris Campbell, the costume designer for the ``X-Files'' quickly
clarifies the meaning: ``She was in a light-colored linen suit
mostly because she was in Africa. If we're in Africa again, she'll
be in appropriate clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Campbell also took the time to provide enlightenment on the
show's clothes in general. ``A lot of what we're constrained by is
the actual restrictions of the FBI,'' she said. ``This is very much
a show that concentrates on being realistic.'' Guidelines provided
by the FBI itself provide detailed dos and don'ts. ``Even right
down to the ladies' hosiery,'' Ms. Campbell said. ``No black
stockings, and hemlines _ no `Ally McBeal.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anderson, although not familiar with the Scullywear
Auxiliary Brigade specifically, is very familiar with the intense
scrutiny of her fans. ``There was a plaid outfit in the first
season I'm sure they have a few things to say about,'' she wrote in
a faxed letter. Although fans may be aghast, the actress doesn't
quite share her alter-ego's taste in clothes. ``A couple pairs of
pants, shirts and jackets,'' she said, ``but I will never wear a
whole Scully suit in my real life. I'd have an identity crisis.''

MAKING THE KITCHEN EASY ON THE COOKS, AND ON THE SENSES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DONNA PAUL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ The kitchen of the past was designed for one
sex: female, whether hired cook or lady of the house. Social
changes, however, have ensured that today, everyone is in the
kitchen, and happy to be: teenagers, children, men, the elderly
and, yes, women.
</P>
<P>
   So, what's wrong with that?
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen, says Jane Langmuir, an architect. It hasn't caught
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get coded at a very early age by memories of the place we
grew up in, and think, `Why change it?''' Ms. Langmuir said. ``But
that kitchen was designed for a single person 5-foot-6. And when
you start putting everyone else in, it's not going to work very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Until you start to carefully watch how people behave in it,''
she added, ``you're unaware of the unsafe, the inefficient _ yes,
the stupid things we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting words, but then Ms. Langmuir enjoys challenging
articles of faith. As an associate professor in the interior design
department at the Rhode Island School of Design, she dreams of
kitchens designed for everyone's ease, from a 5-year-old working on
a Mother's Day breakfast to a 6-foot-2 man pulling together a
dinner party. A kitchen like the one she recently remodeled for
Lisa Limer, a photojournalist; her husband, Ernesto Ugarte, an
international economist, and their two sons.
</P>
<P>
   With both adults traveling frequently for business, they needed
a kitchen that one parent could navigate easily, with areas for
children to hang out or participate in and room for Ms. Limer's two
sisters to help cook during family celebrations. Ms. Limer also
admired the solid, open feeling of kitchens she had seen in Morocco
and the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Langmuir describes her mission as creating ``the nurturing
center of the home.'' The renovation at the Limer-Ugarte house, an
1896 Tudor-style home in the College Hill section of Providence,
came at the same time that Ms. Langmuir was directing the
universal-design kitchen portion of ``Unlimited by Design,'' an
exhibition at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum last winter.
Too often, she explained, people think of universal design as
something for the disabled, but she sees it more broadly, as an
approach with practical and creative solutions that can benefit
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The 300-square-foot Limer-Ugarte kitchen was a handy laboratory,
allowing Ms. Langmuir to translate her ideas into warm, rich
materials _ teak, granite and marble, which she used to great
effect in small proportions, mostly for counters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need a lot of expensive materials,'' she argued,
challenging another misconception. ``One doesn't need the endless
counter surface we often see in so many new kitchens.'' In fact,
she says that being able to stand in one place and complete a task
is more efficient than moving around a large counter space.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen, which had not been renovated since the early 1960s,
was a jumble of three small rooms. It was an eyesore of
avocado-green Formica and brick-pattern linoleum. Several windows
had been covered over, plunging the kitchen into gloom. The
refrigerator, inexplicably, was in a separate room. The microwave
oven above the old stove was out of comfortable reach and dangerous
for children ``likely to drag over a stool to the stove and step up
on it,'' Ms. Langmuir said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the chopped-up configuration has become a single spacious
room organized into zones: a cooking area, a wet preparation area
and another for cleanup and storage. Some of the ideas were simply
logical, like placing the cleanup area near storage.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Langmuir began by redesigning the traditional work
``triangle'' that maps a cook's most frequent moves: from
refrigerator to sink to stove. In today's track-size kitchens, the
cook is often a long-distance runner, dragging the steaming pasta
pot all over the place.
</P>
<P>
   The architect found a way to contain these elements in a
three-foot space, a step from each other. Even if you were to
remove all the rich materials, you would see the efficiency of Ms.
Langmuir's plan.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Following are some other innovations:
</P>
<P>
   EASY ACCESS ``Cooking and prep surfaces should be an extension
of your arm,'' Ms. Langmuir said. ``You want to be able to look
down at what you are doing.'' The cooking surface she designed for
this kitchen is 34 inches high, two inches less than the industry
standard. Reaching across one front burner to stir a pot in the
back is a potential hazard, so she came up with an elegant
alternative: two gas burners positioned side by side, two others
one behind the other.
</P>
<P>
   Major cooking tasks, like sauteing, are done on the side-by-side
burners. The other burners are devoted to simmering and keeping
food warm. A grill is positioned next to the side-by-side burners
as well, which allows for easy access. The cooking units, from the
General Electric Monogram series, were slightly more expensive than
the combined ones, she explained, ``because you're buying two
components rather than one complete unit, but the benefit in
flexibility really does outweigh the cost.''
</P>
<P>
   THE TROUGH Early kitchens were equipped with large, shallow
sinks designed to handle all the washing functions that today's
smaller sinks cannot accommodate. A modern version of this
old-fashioned trough, made by a craftsman on Cape Cod, is 42 inches
long and cost $540. At only four inches deep, it works as well for
preparing vegetables as it does for washing and draining dishes. A
built-in wood cutting board slides as needed. Below the sink are
slide-out metal racks (doors can interfere with movement).
</P>
<P>
   THE SPLIT-LEVEL ISLAND For the center of the kitchen, Ms.
Langmuir designed a three-level work island made of wood; one level
is topped with teak, another with marble and the third with granite
_ expensive materials made affordable thanks to the small amounts
used. She positioned the levels at different heights _ 42 inches,
34 inches and 29 inches _ to correspond to a variety of functions:
baking, cutting, dining. Her split-level design was based on a
study suggesting that starting and completing a task in one place
is more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   CUT CORNERS ON THE CUTTING EDGE Ugarte and Ms. Limer got the
Sub-Zero refrigerator they wanted, but saved at least $1,000 by
choosing a new year-old model. A tip: Ms. Langmuir suggests buying
a refrigerator with the freezer drawer on the bottom. ``It is much
more efficient to have the main body of the refrigeration higher
up, in the comfort zone of the user.''
</P>
<P>
   OPEN CABINETS ``Doors have no spirit,'' Ms. Langmuir said
firmly. Open storage offers the visual relief of decorative
pottery, spices and stacked plates. Vertical cabinets were recycled
from the original kitchen, with new glass fronts. They are linked
by a custom-made drying rack, inspired by ones that Ms. Limer used
while living in Spain and designed by Tom O'Brien. O'Brien, a
craftsman. He measured each pot and pan to determine the size of
the openings.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen was constructed for $46,000, including the
contractor's fee, making it slightly less expensive than the
average kitchen renovation in the United States, which is between
$50,000 and $60,000, according to the National Kitchen and Bath
Association, a trade group. Their figures show that in 1998,
Americans spent $35.9 billion on kitchen remodelings.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Limer contributed marble tiles she found in Madrid, and the
architect integrated them into a border between the former pantry
and kitchen. Excavating layers of linoleum, the team discovered a
terrazzo floor, rare in Northeast kitchens. ``A great find!'' Ms.
Langmuir said. It gave the room a European feeling of solidness and
craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not adhering to convention for convention's sake,'' Ms.
Limer said, admiring the outcome recently from her perch at the new
island. ``Everything has a reason behind it. Jane never once did
anything that was superficial or only for impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Interruptions for travel and frequent changes during the
planning period added to the cost and extended the renovation to 13
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ate out a lot,'' Ms. Langmuir recalled, laughing. ``Lisa
started out with a simpler notion, and once she started it, she
treated it like a work of art. She was like a painter retouching
the canvas. She'd stand back and say, `It needs this.' And we'd
find it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to think that universal design is practical,'' she
added, ``and not aesthetically pleasing. But it is really good
design _ and inherently that's beautiful.''

 &HT;    BUSH SEES 'A CONTEST' WITH McCAIN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE
 &HT;    By JENA HEATH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEREDITH, N.H. _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said Wednesday
that he faces ``a formidable candidate'' in Sen. John McCain, but
bristled at suggestions that he hasn't been working hard enough in
the state that holds the nation's first primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was finishing his eighth visit to New Hampshire, fewer than
most of the other presidential candidates. He gave his standard
campaign speech to a breakfast audience at the the Laconia Chamber
of Commerce and took questions.
</P>
<P>
   Later, speaking with reporters, a clearly annoyed Bush said he
stood by his decision to skip a recent GOP forum in New Hampshire
in order to be with his wife, Laura, when she received an award in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to apologize for anything,'' Bush said. ``I made
the right choice as far as I'm concerned and that's what matters.
That's what matters. People can accept that explanation or not.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that voters in New Hampshire seemed satisfied with his
decision, citing ``the number of people who've walked up to me on
this trip and said, 'I appreciate your standing by your wife's side
a lot.' ``
</P>
<P>
   ``People can accept me for who I am,'' Bush said. ``I hope they
do. But if they thought my decision was not the right decision, to
stand by my wife, there are other candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was clearly aware throughout the visit that he needs to
court this state's fiercely independent voters. With less than
three months before the Feb. 1 primary, McCain has been narrowing
Bush's lead in recent polls here.
</P>
<P>
   ``'I'm not surprised,'' Bush said about McCain's rise. ``He's a
good fellow and he's a good man and he's a formidable candidate. I
suspected there was going to be a contest in this state. There
always is in New Hampshire politics. And I welcome a good
discussion of the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush sounded ready for the challenge, saying, ``This is retail
politics and I like retail politics. I've got a lot of work to do
in the state of New Hampshire, and I understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Plante, a Republican from Manchester, said she is trying
to decide between Bush and the Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next few months we'll watch the campaigns,'' she said. ``I
think those last few weeks are very important.''

   This is ``a banner year'' for enrolling first-year black
students at Texas's public law schools, but 90 percent of them are
attending one school -- historically black Texas Southern
University, state higher education officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Educators say the scant enrollment of blacks at predominantly
white law schools shows how the end of affirmative action in
college admissions still hampers minority enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 212 blacks are first-year law students among the four
state-supported schools. In 1997, only 159 blacks began law
studies. That was a year after Texas colleges dropped race as an
admissions factor because of a reverse-discrimination court ruling
against the University of Texas law school. The case is being
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 6 percent of first-year black law students in Texas
are attending the University of Houston law school. Elsewhere, 3
percent enrolled at UT law school, and 1 percent enrolled at Texas
Tech University's law school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that these schools are still struggling with
minority recruitment,'' said Lynn Rodriguez,

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The advertisements are popping up in practically
every periodical with a classified section _ and especially on the
Internet: ``Bye Bye 1999, Hello 2000!'' ``Y2K New York Style.''
``Great Millennium Rentals.'' ``1 bedroom fully furnished
apartment, East Side 20s close to everything,'' boasts another ad.
The price? Ten thousand dollars, from Dec. 28, 1999, to Jan. 2,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the Manhattan millennium rental market is as flat as
a leftover glass of Veuve Cliquot on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millions of people want to rent out their apartments, but
nobody has expressed any interest in taking them up on it,'' said
Frederick W. Peters, the president of Ashforth Warburg Real Estate
in Manhattan. A few weeks ago, Peters was gearing up to unveil a
separate millennium rentals division. Now, he doesn't see the
point.
</P>
<P>
   That may be just as well. A lot of these rentals are probably
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Stuart Saft, the chairman of the Council of New York
Cooperatives and Condominiums, said that if the people who are
trying to rent out their apartments for the millennium weeks do not
have the required permission from landlords or co-op or condo
boards that demand it, they could be in trouble. ``They've got an
illegal sublet, sure,'' said Saft, who is also a real estate
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   One professional woman who has listed her co-op studio near
Lincoln Center with a real estate agent for $3,000 for the week
surrounding the millennial celebrations acknowledged as much. She
was happy to reveal her address but not her name. ``It's not
legal,'' she whispered. Even though she hasn't had any takers, or
even any expressions of interest, she is still hoping. After all,
she has already bought the tickets for her own trip to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Juanita Scarlett, a spokeswoman for the state
attorney general's office, said that the office was aware of
millennium rentals being advertised and is ``keeping an eye on the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   If there are abuses or complaints, it will investigate, she
said. Most bylaws restrict occupancy to owners or shareholders and
their families and guests, she explained. Her office, she said,
doesn't usually get involved with this issue when it comes to
co-ops and condos _ they are essentially private corporations _ but
would do so if an apartment was rent-controlled or rent-stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   Penalties for such violations, she added, include fines and
eviction.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Steinberg, the president of the board of directors at 60
Gramercy Park North, a prewar doorman building where one-bedrooms
sell for more than $400,000, said that he had heard about such
rentals, but not in his building. ``They are absolutely verboten,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Lamb, the president of J.&AMP; C. Lamb Management, which
manages 60 Gramercy, said that many buildings use a rule of thumb:
no overnight guests without the co-op shareholder's being present.
</P>
<P>
   But Steinberg and Saft both said that if someone does rent out
his apartment _ and takes off for his own millennium celebration
in, say, the South of France _ the legality or illegality of the
impromptu sublet may be moot.
</P>
<P>
   ``If some guy shows up on New Year's Eve with a suitcase and a
lease,'' Saft began, ``what's the doorman supposed to do? They
won't be able to find a judge on the weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg concurred. ``What are we supposed to do _ arrest them
ourselves?''
</P>
<P>
   Saft said that if a board thinks there might be a problem when
2000 rolls around, it should take action now: vote to impose hefty
fines _ maybe $1,000 a day _ for anyone illegally renting out an
apartment, and make sure the tenants know about it. That way, the
board can both prepare for future action and unleash a powerful
deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what, some New Yorkers will try to make a quick buck
by renting without permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't list them because it's not legal, and we're a public
company,'' said Marge Pearson, the director of residential rentals
at Douglas Elliman. ``But are people doing it anyway? Sure. I've
heard ridiculous prices: $10,000 for the week.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been reports of Manhattanites who have privately
auctioned off their places on the Web for astronomical figures.
</P>
<P>
   It's those mouthwatering tales that keep at least a few big real
estate companies advertising the rentals. But are these legal?
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally we check them out,'' said Ruth McCoy, the executive
director of Feathered Nest, one of the city's busiest rental
companies. ``They're either condos or private houses, brownstones _
something like that.'' She added that her company had about 50
apartments available for millennial rental.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCoy dismissed rumors that agents are charging 35 percent
commissions above the rental prices; commissions for short-term
rentals vary, she explained, but average about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although her company has not yet rented out one of its
apartments, Ms. McCoy said that inquiries were starting to pick up.
``In fact, we're thinking of doing a Web page just for millennial
rentals,'' she said. ``We're looking at it like a
once-in-a-lifetime thing, because none of us expect to be alive for
the next one, and we're thinking: What do we have to lose? It's
kind of fun. We'll see.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCoy was asked if she thought charging $10,000 a week for a
smallish apartment was price gouging. ``Hey, nobody's being forced
to do it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Feathered Nest's listings is a loft in what used to be
called Little Italy. ``It's now NoLIta,'' said John Buscemi, who
operates a cell-phone store a block away on Mott Street.
</P>
<P>
   After Buscemi heard of people renting out an apartment in
Stuyvesant Town for $4,000 a week, he and his wife, America
Sanchez, wondered what their spacious two-bedroom loft condominium
might bring. Buscemi listed it and even recruited another six
owners in the building to list their lofts, too. (He has also
booked tickets for a trip _ to Peru.)
</P>
<P>
   Buscemi's price is flexible, depending on the services you want,
but the millennium rent starts at $1,000 a night. ``I got friends
in the neighborhood who are chefs,'' he said, ``and they're
available to come in and cook for you. I got a cleaning lady who'll
make the beds and clean _ whatever you want! You know, hotels have
minibars? Well, look in this cupboard _ all the best liquors. I
even have champagne!''
</P>
<P>
   As Buscemi escorted a reporter to the door, Lulu, the couple's
schnauzer, pranced up.
</P>
<P>
   Is Lulu flying with the family to Peru? ``No, Lulu comes with
the apartment,'' he said, laughing. ``Anyone would want Lulu for
the millennium, don't you think?''

THE PROBLEM OF NOT BEING A MILESTONE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Karol Szymanowski's ``King Roger'' is a beautiful opera with
qualities that work against its survival. Think first about the
practical matters of putting any opera on. At 80 minutes, this one
is too short for a full evening, and finding a suitable partner for
a double bill is not easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``King Roger,'' if the composer's elaborate directions are
followed, is complicated to stage, this coupled with the fact that
in terms of theater, very little happens in it.
</P>
<P>
   A debate between the Apollonian and Dionysian spirits is rich
food for contemplation, but grand opera craves direction and
movement, something more on the lines of Mimi and Rodolfo. Operas
that cast ideas as their principal characters have a hard time
getting on. Schoenberg's ``Moses und Aron,'' despite its
intelligent admirers, may be one of these. The deep philosophical
idea will never win an Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   ``King Roger'' may find in history an even greater enemy.
History is made when we turn around and create fictitious order
from the chaos left directly behind us. Cause and effect are the
principal engines; trends, categories and inheritance are tools of
choice.
</P>
<P>
   History is an attempt to lay a firm foundation under our feet
right now. Schoenberg and Wagner helped bring us to where we are;
they belong to history because they changed things. Szymanowski
doesn't because he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   It is the avant-garde that we seem to cherish, and ``King
Roger'' was never a member. It lay well behind the front lines of
historical advance, more like a crossroads familiar and well
traveled.
</P>
<P>
   Szymanowski, who began ``King Roger'' about the time of World
War I, worked deep inside the German tradition, but the musical
cultures of the Mediterranean rim fascinated him. Debussy's
parallel harmonies and Scriabin's ecstatic surges had a place in
his mind, and next to them, the folk tunes of his native Poland and
the dolefulness of Russian opera. ``King Roger'' is a receptacle,
not a rocket to the moon.
</P>
<P>
   The opera has had uncharacteristic exposure recently. Charles
Dutoit and the Montreal Symphony presented it during one of their
regular visits to Carnegie Hall last month, and now the marketplace
offers a recording on EMI Classics by Simon Rattle and the City of
Birmingham Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Each enterprise in its own way offers a lifeline to this fragile
piece of history. In concert, one sees a little, imagines more and
hears a lot. On CD, our eyes are taken away, but this deprivation
may steer us closer to the humanistic arguments the composer puts
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Szymanowski indulges two of his bents at once by superimposing
Apollo and Dionysus on the affairs of a medieval Sicilian court.
King Roger and his entourage are visited by a Shepherd, preaching
the virtues of a different god. This new religion, with beauty and
sensual delight as its rewards, attracts and co-opts first Roger's
queen, Roxana, then nearly all the King's entourage.
</P>
<P>
   Roger mourns and struggles, but he is not subdued. As the opera
ends, he contemplates the rising sun, which incorporates the
Dionysian force that has given him so much trouble but under the
broader aegis of high-mindedness and restraint.
</P>
<P>
   The composer's directions call for a Byzantine church,
resplendent in marble columns, mosaic floors and carved lions, but
bearing the decorative marks of Arab predecessors, especially roof
beams carved with verses from the Koran. Crowds of people, monks
and nuns are specified. Big choirs sing in ancient church
harmonies. Szymanowski saw the scene precisely, remembering from
his own travels the palace of the kings in Palermo.
</P>
<P>
   This is an awful lot of spectacle for such a brief opera during
which so many people stand still. ``King Roger'' was finished in
1924 but waited two years for its premiere, in Warsaw. Few have
tried to put it on since. Though the neglect is understandable, the
loss to the public is considerable, so recordings or live
performances that bypass the stage are welcome.
</P>
<P>
   As a composer, Szymanowski is less an imitator than a
synthesizer. His orchestration may be Szymanowski learning from
Debussy what Debussy learned from Wagner, but the result is utterly
genuine and personal.
</P>
<P>
   Szymanowski, moreover, had a naked heart, and that in a
method-obsessed century mistrustful of emotional directness and
lack of inhibition. Very few of us have been able to lay ourselves
on the line; Messiaen perhaps, but I can't think of many others.
</P>
<P>
   Rattle's recording has the estimable Thomas Hampson in the title
role, and he does a distinguished job. Aside from Philip Langridge
as the Arabian sage Edrisi, the rest of the cast is Polish, notably
Elzbieta Szmytka (Roxana) and Ryszard Minkiewicz (the Shepherd).
Rattle conducts with his customary poise, command and spirit, using
choruses from Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   Dutoit's all-Polish cast may have been even better: Wojtek
Drabowicz equal to Hampson as King Roger; Zofia Kilanowicz, Piotr
Kusiewicz and Ludovit Ludha passionate as Roxana, Edrisi and the
Shepherd.
</P>
<P>
   What a pleasure to have heard both casts. They remind us that
Central and Eastern European musical cultures possess operas of
their own, with singers to sing them in the original languages. A
nation's myths and folklore are its spiritual glue, and protecting
them is a priority right up there with air forces and field
artillery.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of these operas (the more international ``King Roger''
being an exception) do not travel well, but we should know more

   The New York Times' computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is a fairly large
difference between Cleveland (No. 29) and Cincinnati (No. 30), and
a much smaller difference between Kansas City (No. 1) and
Jacksonville (No. 2).

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christine Bourron will not call what she is doing revenge
against the art world, but just two years ago, she visited dozens
of galleries in both Boston and New York with a simple mission: to
buy an original work of art as a birthday gift for her mother. She
had a clear idea of what she wanted _ a painting of flowers by any
American artist. She was willing to spend about $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   The galleries did not seem to want her money. ```That's not the
way to buy art,''' she said they had told her. ``You are supposed
to look at the art, and it's supposed to talk to you.''' As she
recalled this advice, her face registered what she thought of it.
</P>
<P>
   She did not get what she wanted at any of the galleries, but she
did get the idea for her business, which she began in March 1998.
Now, at age 32, Ms. Bourron is an instant grande dame in an
industry that, though not in full bloom, is suddenly taking root:
the selling of art online.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in her office in Silicon Alley in New York _ an office
that has little in it except computers and paintings by artists
from Africa, China and Russia _ Ms. Bourron navigates through her
Web site, PaintingsDirect.com. She is able to see a virtual
reproduction of every painting that hangs on her office walls,
along with thousands of other images of original works of art. They
are all for sale _ and all can be searched for in 10 different
ways, not just by artist or style but also by price, size, color
and by more than 200 keywords, including ``flower'' and ``vase''
and ``bouquet.''
</P>
<P>
   PaintingsDirect.com was not the earliest site to sell art, but
these days it is looking positively venerable
(www.paintingsdirect.com). Among a dozen or so such sites now in
operation, most were started within the past few months. EBay, in
partnership with several auction houses, went online with its Great
Collections site on Oct. 19 with 150 paintings. The minimum bids
listed went as high as $20,000 and as low as $100.
</P>
<P>
   IncredibleArt.com, based in Los Angeles, went online a week
earlier (www.incredibleart.com), offering both original artwork and
posters.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden proliferation of these sites alarms some people in
the art world, who question not just what protections buyers have,
but whether what is offered by some of the sites can even be called
art.
</P>
<P>
   But others are joining the party. Sotheby's, in partnership with
Amazon.com, is planning to hold auctions on its site by the end of
this year; Christie's, focusing on works estimated at $1,000 to
$10,000, plans to do so at the beginning of next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing what's happening,'' said Terri Kahan, president
and founder of yet another art e-commerce site, Onview.com, based
in New York, which plans to go online at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   The sites that sell art can be roughly divided into three
categories. Those like Art.com (www.art.com) and Barewalls.com
(www.barewalls.com) are selling mass-produced posters, prints and
reproductions. Getty Images bought Art.com, based in Illinois, and
has begun a $20 million advertising campaign that is heating up
this month. It includes billboards, magazine advertisements (``Get
a still life'') and radio spots with Peter Graves of the
``Biography'' television show telling the stories of various
``twisted and tormented'' artists and concluding, ``If you'd like
to purchase the work of this poor soul, go to Art.com.''
</P>
<P>
   At the opposite end are sites trying to put the established art
world online, like the auction houses' sites, and Artnet.com (whose
offices off Wall Street are just a few blocks away from
PaintingsDirect). According to Artnet, in the six months after its
debut, in March of this year, it sold a million dollars' worth of
fine art in online auctions. The average price was $3,200, but a
painting sold for $168,000, the company reported.
</P>
<P>
   It is in this high end that the lure of online art buying is
most amazing. Less than a year ago, many people in the art world
said that it would never happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of pooh-poohing at first,'' said Martha
Fleischman, the second-generation president of Kennedy Galleries,
on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, which was founded in 1874. ``So many
of us _ art dealers, collectors _ were not prepared to accept that
people would buy art electronically. So much of what we do is so
personal, is based so much on trust.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, Ms. Fleischman said, ``nobody wants to be left out.''
Many galleries have their own Web sites; a few are even selling
online. About 800 of the most reputable galleries around the world
have paid Artnet.com a fee to be listed and have the images of
their current exhibitions and some of their inventory displayed on
the site.
</P>
<P>
   The turnaround in the attitude of the art world, many agree,
occurred after Sotheby's announced in January that it was getting
into the online auction business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The art market will change more radically than any other
market has changed because of the Internet,'' predicted Hans
Neuendorf, the founder of Artnet.com, who has been in the art
business for 35 years; he started his own gallery in Germany at age
24. ``The secondary art market'' _ fine art that is no longer in
the hands of the artists themselves _ ``is going to move to the
Internet altogether by the year after next.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is so sure. ``We don't know yet what's going to
happen,'' said Ms. Fleischman, who is one of three members of the
Internet committee of the Art Dealers Association of America, which
includes about 150 of the nation's leading fine-arts dealers. ``I'm
not convinced that people are going to buy quality art at the click
of a mouse.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the current collectors will not necessarily abandon what
they know, ``the Internet will bring in new buyers who have been
intimidated about art,'' said Andy Schoelkopf, president of
Christie's Internet Auctions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Most art e-commerce sites, including PaintingsDirect, belong to
a middle category, offering lower-priced original works of art,
most of it from unknown and emerging artists.
</P>
<P>
   The average price of art that has sold on PaintingsDirect is
$600; the highest price was $3,800, but there are many paintings
that sell for as little as $40. Ms. Bourron said the lower prices
might be part of the reason 60 percent of the buyers at
PaintingsDirect were purchasing original works of art for the first
time in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening is a virtual Renaissance,'' said Leif
Youngberg, who started JustOriginals.com, in Albuquerque, in May.
He said the paintings at his site had sold for an average of
$1,800. ``Like the Renaissance, when art was available
everywhere,'' he said, ``with the virtual Renaissance, there will
be art available all over the world to anybody in the world,
instantaneously.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet will also widen opportunities for those making art,
these entrepreneurs say. ``There are 190,000 professional artists
in the United States,'' Ms. Bourron said. ``But only about 46,000
of them have art dealers because there are 4,600 art galleries in
the United States, representing just five to 15 artists apiece.''
</P>
<P>
   While there are plenty of artists to go around, the art e-sites
already seem to be fighting over certain ones.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Gross, a Brooklyn artist who specializes in painting
landscapes of run-down industrial sites, recalled getting a
mysterious voice-mail message from a company called NextMonet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to represent you _ worldwide,'' the message said,
and then there was a giggle. Ms. Gross did not know what the caller
was talking about, but ``worldwide'' was something of a pun _ a
reference to the World Wide Web. Soon after, Ms. Gross was sought
out by Guild.com, a Wisconsin-based e-commerce company that sells
original paintings but specializes in crafts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gross decided to go with NextMonet, which started up in June
and is based in San Francisco. She became one of 400 artists under
contract to the site.
</P>
<P>
   In the few short months of the affiliation, Ms. Gross said, she
has been happier with NextMonet than she has been with the various
brick-and-mortar galleries that represent her. Both the galleries
and NextMonet take 50 percent as their commission. But of
NextMonet, Ms. Gross said: ``I get paid almost immediately.
Sometimes with the galleries I have to go after the money.''

   Another legal battle has erupted between traditional bookstores
and online booksellers _ this time among textbook shops. The
National Association of College Stores, which represents 3,000
stores, is suing VarsityBooks.com, an online textbook store, for
what the association says is false and misleading advertising
concerning discounts.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit accuses VarsityBooks.com of advertising discounts of
up to 40 percent of ``suggested list prices'' when, the association
contends, there is no such thing as a suggested price in the
textbook business. The suit was filed in federal District Court in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members are deeply concerned that students are being duped
into believing they're saving 40 percent on textbooks when such
claims are completely false,'' said Brian Cartier, chief staff
officer for the association, in a statement released on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Cartier said the lawsuit was not an attempt by the association
to thwart online sales. ``We simply cannot stand idly by, however,
when huge sums of money are being spent on deceptive advertising
and promotional campaigns directed at college students,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Kaplan, vice president for communications and strategic
planning at VarsityBooks.com., called the lawsuit ``completely
without merit.'' Kaplan said VarsityBooks.com's suggested prices
came from the company's distributor, Baker &AMP; Taylor, which is based
in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The bickering may sound familiar. In 1997, the retail giant
Barnes &AMP; Noble sued Amazon.com, then a fledgling online bookseller,
accusing it of false advertising when Amazon.com used the words
``world's largest bookstore'' in its promotional material. Six
months later, the lawsuit was settled, with both companies saying
that ``they would rather compete in the marketplace than in the
courtroom.'' Barnesandnoble.com was born the same year.

   At the Movies, but Nary a `Shhhhhhh' Will Be Heard &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now you never have to leave the house: the worlds of home video
and chat are colliding. The makers of the film ``The Matrix'' are
holding an online screening and inviting owners of DVD-ROM copies
to chat with the filmmakers, Andy and Larry Wachowski.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're inviting people to come to the world's largest virtual
theater and watch the movie with its creators,'' said Jim Wuthrich,
vice president of Internet marketing for Warner Home Video, which
has released ``The Matrix'' on DVD and will be releasing the film
next month on videocassette tape.
</P>
<P>
   At 9 p.m. on Saturday, registered owners of the 1.5 million
copies of ``The Matrix'' DVD, by far the biggest-selling film on
DVD, can log into an Internet site. The site will automatically
start ``The Matrix'' on each person's DVD drive, synchronizing the
film for everyone logged into the site
(www.warnervideo.com/matrixevents). Wuthrich said that would allow
anyone with the DVD and an Internet-enabled computer with a DVD-ROM
drive to see the film and enter a chat room that will carry live
the Wachowski brothers' written responses to typed-in questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time,'' said Thomas F. Lesinski, senior vice
president of Internet marketing for Warner Home Video, ``that it is
really OK to talk to a movie.''

   GM to Offer a New Reason to Keep the Cell Phone On
</P>
<P>
   For drivers not already talking on their cellular phones, the
General Motors Corp. plans to introduce a new service sometime next
year that will let them surf the Internet from a car.
</P>
<P>
   The service will be offered as an addition to the Onstar
cellular phone and navigation system, which is already used by
94,000 owners of luxury G.M. cars and sport utility vehicles. To
reduce the safety risks that might come from distracted drivers, no
computer screens will be used for the new service.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, drivers and passengers will be able to issue commands
like ``start my e-mail'' or ``start my stock quotes,'' instructions
that should be recognized by voice-recognition software in the
Onstar system.
</P>
<P>
   In response to these and other commands, drivers will hear a
computer-generated voice _ received over their cars' cellular
phones _ that will read stock price quotes, news, sports scores and
the text of any e-mail messages. It will not be possible to send
e-mail messages when the system is introduced, although that may be
added later, GM officials said.
</P>
<P>
   GM officials said they had not set a price for the service or
decided how many cars would have it. But with GM planning to
install the equipment for Onstar on a million vehicles in the next
18 months, the Internet service could become widely available
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies, including the Ford Motor Co. and the Microsoft
Corp., have also been working on Web access for cars, as the auto
industry increasingly works with e-commerce companies.

   A Device That Soaks Up All the White Board Can Hold
</P>
<P>
   If the words ``white board'' conjure images of long meetings and
fingers cramped from note-taking, the Mimio might have a market.
The $499 device, by Boston-based Virtual Ink (www.mimio.com),
captures meeting notes, brainstorms and brilliant doodlings as fast
as they are rendered and saves them to a computer. The signals are
received by a 2-foot-long Mimio bar, which attaches to the average
white board and is connected to a computer. It picks up ultrasonic
and infrared signals sent by a wireless holder that slips onto a
regular dry-erase marker that is used for writing. The sketches can
be exported into programs like Word and shared with others. Imagine
what college students could do if their teachers used the Mimio?

   Free Software Sounds Alerts On Sites' Use of Personal Data
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com may have attracted 13 million shoppers, but how many
of them really know what the company plans to do with their
personal information? That is the question asked by Enonymous.com,
a new company that wants to give Web surfers a more complete
picture of exactly how sites plan to use their names, e-mail
addresses and any other information they collect.
</P>
<P>
   The company, in San Diego, is distributing a free Internet
utility called Enonymous Advisor. A computer equipped with the
Advisor, which can be downloaded from www.enonymous.com, detects
sites that request personal information. When a fill-in-the-blank
form is opened on a user's Web browser, a window pops up with
information about how the site rates on consumer privacy. The
ratings are based on Enonymous' evaluation of the site's privacy
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, Yahoo.com and Expedia.com are among about two dozen
sites receiving one star each _ the lowest rank, which means that
the site may share personal data without permission. The maximum
rating is four stars.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Capelli, a spokesman for Amazon.com, said that the company
was not very concerned about the rating. The company's privacy
policy states that it ``does not sell, trade, or rent your personal
information to others.'' But the next sentence continues: ``We may
choose to do so in the future with trustworthy third parties, but
you can tell us not to by sending a blank e-mail message to
never(AT)amazon.com.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our policy is clearly defined,'' Capelli said, ``and
that our customers are comfortable with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Enonymous.com awarded four stars to sites like Ebay.com, Aol.com
and Hotmail.com, which share users' information only with their
permission and will contact them, via e-mail or otherwise, only
with their permission.
</P>
<P>
   In the next year, the company plans to make money (instead of
simply giving away software) by creating the online equivalent of
anonymous post-office boxes for people who want to receive certain
kinds of advertisements without giving out their e-mail addresses.
But in the meantime, said David Taylor, Enonymous' president and
chief executive, ``we're trying to define some new rules.''

   NEW YORK _ John Healy owns three computers, has a constantly
ringing cellular telephone and oversees 33 employees. His workday
starts at 7 a.m. sharp, firing off e-mail messages to his staff,
clients and board members. Sounds like a typical executive climbing
the corporate ladder, but in this case the corporation is the San
Remo apartment building on Central Park West, and the ladder Healy
is climbing leads not to a corner office but to a suite _ where he
works as the building's superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, ``resident manager.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to understand that a super in this day no longer
means being a glorified janitor,'' Healy, 40, said. ``Prices run
high for property in this city, and the expectations from people
living in the building can run even higher. I have to uphold a very
professional image.'' And he does: two of his three children are in
private schools, he dresses in shirt and tie, and he lives in a
three-bedroom apartment in the towered colossus he manages. (OK, so
he doesn't have a park view but, hey, rent-free is rent-free.)
</P>
<P>
   The days of the super's arriving at your door with a wrench and
a flashlight are waning. Today, he may take emergency calls from
tenants like Steve Martin, Demi Moore and Steven Spielberg, but
someone else will come and unclog the sink or fix the faucet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the administrative person, or the visionary,'' Healy said,
straightening his Brooks Brothers tie. ``The board considers me the
CEO.'' Which explains why he attends board meetings at least twice
a week, is setting up a San Remo Web site and is studying for a
Ph.D. in social work. ``I am maintaining and running a
multimillion-dollar business,'' Healy said of his job.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, having a super who is too fancy to sully his
hands on a drain is every apartment dweller's nightmare. So who
does the down and dirty work? Healy's assistant and four handymen
make house calls, tools in tow.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, being a building superintendent has
become what could be perceived as an enviable career, rather than a
drudge job. Professional clubs, guilds and schools across New York
City attest to growing numbers of young building superintendents
and resident managers like Stephen Benner, armed with certificates
in finance management, computer literacy and blueprint drafting,
who aspire to high-powered management.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't understand the dynamics of management, you're
just fixing things,'' said Benner, 39, a former policeman who has
enhanced his professional profile with 20 licenses and
certificates, earned over some 2,000 classroom hours. Benner, who
manages 45 E. 89th St., is just credits away from being a licensed
property manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old Scandinavians used to say, `The building is your ship,
and you are the captain,''' said Ally Lamaj, who arrived in this
country from Albania 31 years ago and joined the Scandinavian
Resident Managers Guild. Leaving a cook's job, he earned an
engineering degree and studied finance management along with boiler
repair. Today, Lamaj, 42, manages 1175 Park Ave., a 50-unit
building, where he oversees 10 employees. The guild was organized
in 1934 for skilled Scandinavian merchant marines who needed help
finding work. But now, the group represents a newer wave of
immigrants: Albanian, Russian, Serbian and Hispanic, many of whom
arrived with engineering backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Superintending is also an occupation that women have broken
into. ``I think women actually make the best supers, because they
tend to be more sensitive, and many have established wonderful
relationships with the tenants,'' said Dick Koral, a director of
New York City Technical College, where he also teaches.
</P>
<P>
   Yolanda Dominges has made it to resident manager (defined as one
who manages eight or more employees) at 205 E. 63rd St., a 130-unit
building, although she is still the only woman in the union who
has.
</P>
<P>
   What has produced the new supersuperintendent?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a constant need for building superintendents, because
there is a high turnover from the older generations to the new,''
said James O'Connor, the executive managing director for Insignia
Residential Group, which owns Douglas Elliman. The Realty Advisory
Board estimates there are 3,000 unionized building superintendents
in the city.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor believes that the shift toward a higher level of
professionalism is caused by rising property values, as well as by,
in real estate lingo, ``smart buildings,'' computerized buildings,
which require computer-literate superintendents to check the oil in
the boiler or to adjust the ventilation system. ``Now, the
expectations are much higher than they used to be,'' said O'Connor,
who favors applicants with high-tech training.
</P>
<P>
   Healy agreed. ``Just five years ago, many of the older
superintendents just had mechanical expertise,'' he said. ``Now you
have to know how to write letters, you have to know how to use
e-mail, and you have to be able to articulate yourself with
architects, contractors and board members.'' Healy's job includes
projecting long-term capital improvements, ``especially important
for people purchasing in co-op buildings,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   To get a job as building superintendent, you don't have to be a
union member, but you are expected to join after accepting a
position. The Thomas Shortman training program of Local 32B-32J of
the Service Employees International, a free school for union
members, offers courses and certificate programs, which take nine
months. Alfonso Nieves, the school's director, maintains that
standards are rising at such a rapid pace that the curriculum keeps
changing just to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   The school, with annual enrollment of more than 2,000, offers
Super I the basics; advanced training in blueprinting and landscape
design, and the popular Super II course (management training,
contract negotiation and administration).
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few fields where you can literally get off the
boat, educate yourself in a relatively short amount of time and
land a decent job,'' said Benner, the former policeman who is now
an instructor at the school _ and one of its many success stories.
Benner was promoted from handyman to resident manager at Carnegie
Hill Tower on East 94th Street. He opted for a lateral move to 45
E. 89th St., where he manages a 17-member staff and got a much
larger apartment for his family. The arrangement includes the use
of a rooftop pool, where his children can swim.
</P>
<P>
   The most important aspect of the job is how you relate to
people, he said, adding: ``You just won't last in the business
unless you have tremendous interpersonal skills. It is a job where
you have to know how to talk and negotiate with everyone from the
resident to the contractor to the owner of the building.'' Koral,
of New York City Technical College, said that former doormen have
the inside employment track, ``because they have already
established very positive relationships with the people living in
the building.''
</P>
<P>
   But for aspiring supers seeking luxurious life styles, the jobs
at high-end buildings are few.
</P>
<P>
   As Nikolaus Wagner proudly pointed out, his is ``a life style
that many would envy.'' Wagner, 42 and Romanian-born, oversees 18
people at 120 East End Avenue, a 42-unit building. When he is not
at the building, he is sailing. Flags from recent races and
pennants deck his office, along with a model of a favorite
two-masted schooner. He spends weekends racing in a crew on a
44-foot sailboat.
</P>
<P>
   Hobbies aside, the perquisites of today's thoroughly modern
super can be impressive. Most of Insignia Residential's buildings,
for example, offer superintendents and their families rent-free
apartments, garage space and paid utilities. The base salaries are
$45,000 to $85,000 a year, but supers who are in position to know
say that, with bonuses and tips, the take-home pay can be more than
$100,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The better the perks, the more technical the job. Koral said
that there was a high consciousness among property management
companies about energy costs. It is a super's job to rein in those
costs and guarantee that the systems work efficiently. This week, a
coalition of real estate corporations began advising the Shortman
program on making the curriculum even more high-tech, with a
financial component.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Guzman, who was a handyman for 10 years, has become the
resident manager of the Leighton House, a 165-unit apartment
building at 366 E. 88th St. With Guzman as captain, rather than
crew, things often get done better than before: some weeks ago, a
young couple with two children called in a panic because of a large
leak in the bathroom. In minutes, Guzman, who has a degree in
business management, arrived at the door in a suit, a handyman at
his side. ``We solved the problem in 20 minutes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The tenants, used to a six-month wait, couldn't believe it. In
another instance, Guzman put out a fire, caused by a tenant's
leaving a couple of candles burning, before the Fire Department
arrived. ``No one realized I had taken the fire safety director
exam,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting, the tenants association asked him what his vision
was (something most professionals might spend the better part of
their careers waiting to be asked). He said he wanted the Leighton
House to be one of the best apartment houses in New York City. ``I
don't think they realized the kind of goals I have for myself,''
said Guzman, who takes his building very personally.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: We have wallpaper on our bedroom walls that I would like to
remove so that we can paint that room. This is a regular wallpaper,
not a vinyl.
</P>
<P>
   I tried scraping a section off, but the paper kept tearing and
all I got off was a small piece at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Short of renting a wallpaper steamer (which I don't want to use
in my bedroom) what can I do to remove this paper without calling
in a professional?
</P>
<P>
   A: To remove old wallpaper you have to soak the paper enough to
soften the paste or glue on the back of the paper.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to do this is to soak the paper with a liquid
wallpaper stripping solution (sold in paint and wallpaper stores).
This is applied to the paper with a roller or sprayer.
</P>
<P>
   To help it soak in and penetrate you should perforate or deeply
score the surface of the paper before applying the stripping
solution. This can be done by scratching up the surface of the
paper with a very coarse grade of sandpaper or, better yet, by
using a special tool such as the PaperTiger shown here.
</P>
<P>
   After soaking, the paper can be scraped off with a wall scraper
that is sold for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The light green asphalt shingles on my roof have developed a
series of ugly dark streaks or stains, mostly on the north side of
the house.
</P>
<P>
   The south side, which gets more hours of sunlight, has almost no
such discolorations. What can be causing this, and what can I do to
remove these stains?
</P>
<P>
   A: Chances are the stains are due to mildew since the sunny
areas do not have this problem.
</P>
<P>
   You can wash the dark stains off with a commercial mildewcide
(sold in building supply stores, as well as in pool supply outlets)
or with a solution of liquid bleach and water (one part bleach to
four parts water).
</P>
<P>
   However, unless you replace the shingles with a mildew-resistant
type, it is likely that the mildew will come back from time to
time, depending on humidity and other environmental conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have a discolored stain on the brick hearth in front of
our fireplace, left by a plant that has since been removed.
</P>
<P>
   I can't seem to scrub this stain off with the usual cleaners. Do
you have any suggestions as to what I can try?
</P>
<P>
   A: It is always difficult to remove stains from porous brick,
although a strong detergent mixed with hot water often works.
</P>
<P>
   If merely scrubbing doesn't do the trick, try this technique:
</P>
<P>
   Wet the stained area with straight liquid detergent, then cover
the wetted area with a thick layer of dry powdered cement or kitty
litter.
</P>
<P>
   Pour on a little more of the same detergent, then cover with a
piece of plastic kitchen wrap and tape down the edges to help keep
the paste from drying out quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Wait overnight, then scrape the dried paste off.
</P>
<P>
   If this seems to help, you might want to repeat the process
until the stain diminishes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The paint on our apartment ceiling keeps peeling off in some
places.
</P>
<P>
   This ceiling was scraped and repainted with a primer and flat,
but in a year the same areas started to peel again.
</P>
<P>
   I have been told this is because the ceilings are concrete which
was never cured properly. Is there a type of paint that will stick
to the concrete?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although it is possible that the problem is caused by poorly
cured concrete, this in not likely.
</P>
<P>
   It is more likely there is something on the surface of that
ceiling that is causing the paint to peel in those places.
</P>
<P>
   I think the cure lies in stripping all paint off the ceiling,
using a chemical paint remover, then priming with a coat of a
stain-killing sealer such as BIN, Kilz or similar product before
you go ahead with one or two finish coats of a latex ceiling paint.

 &HT;    Nielsen's got TV hyped for sweeps
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ally McBeal gets a new shrink, ``Annie'' gets a new hairdo,
Marge Simpson gets kidnapped by bikers, Frasier gets another shot
at Lilith, Becker just gets shot, and Regis Philbin gets to ask,
over and over, ``Is that your final answer?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Regis, the final answer is that November sweeps are here,
starting tonight: Four weeks of stunts, specials, guest stars, very
special episodes and hucksterism the likes of which we haven't
heard, well, since the new season started in September.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, the networks don't like the big sweeps periods in
November, February and May, because they burn off too much good
programming in head-to-head competition. But that's when Nielsen
Media Research monitors TV viewing in over half the United States
to set ad rates. The 47 biggest cities, including Atlanta, are
measured electronically year-round, but the rest of the country is
still gauged with diaries filled out by hand during sweeps, in a
system that dates back to 1954.
</P>
<P>
   So thank, or blame, the antiquated Nielsen system for the next
four weeks of hyped-to-the-eyebrows television. Here's an overview
of some of what's in store.
</P>
<P>
   FAVORITE SERIES:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Friends'' (8 tonight on NBC) _ Monica and Rachel split as
roommates tonight, as do Joey and Chandler. Joey won't be hurting
too badly, though; next week, Elle MacPherson starts a recurring
role as his new roomie.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Ally McBeal'' (9 p.m. Mondays on Fox) _ Ally's new therapist
(Betty White) doses her with Prozac on Monday. On Nov. 29, Farrah
Fawcett plays a client suing her employees for sexual harrassment,
and one of the firm's lawyers is supposed to resign.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Drew Carey Show'' (9 p.m. Wednesdays on ABC) _ ``ER''
live was nothing compared to Wednesday's show. It will be done
three times, live in different time zones, and parts of each show
will be unscripted improv bits. On Nov. 17, Drew becomes a web
pitchman for Winfred-Louder, and the show will be simulcast on
several websites, including www.abc.com. Finally, on Dec. 1, Steve
and Mimi get married.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ``Angel'' (8 and 9 p.m.
Tuesdays on the WB) _ No surprise that the big Buffy-Angel double
crossover comes during sweeps, on Nov. 23.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Touched By An Angel'' (8 p.m. Sundays on CBS) _ Hot young
singer Charlotte Church (she's in those Ford commercials) is a very
unangelic little girl Nov. 14; boy band 'N Sync also appears in an
attempt to attract viewers under 60.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The West Wing'' (9 p.m. Wednesday on NBC) _ Stockard
Channing guest stars as the unseen-so-far First Lady, and Rob
Lowe's call-girl-friend shows up at a state dinner.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Simpsons'' (8 p.m. Sundays on Fox) _ Homer bowls a
perfect game on Nov. 14; somehow Penn &AMP; Teller are involved. On
Nov. 21, Apu and his wife have octuplets, and Marge is kidnapped by
a biker gang on Nov. 28.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``ER'' (10 tonight on NBC) _ Alan Alda continues as the doc
who's scalpel isn't as sharp as it used to be, and Rebecca DeMornay
is still brushing off Carter. But the big night will be Nov. 25,
Thanksgiving, when Carol Hathaway has her twins after going into
labor on the subway in a snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Dawson's Creek'' (8 p.m. Wednesdays on the WB) _ Dawson
films a homage to ``The Blair Witch Project'' Nov. 17 _ haven't
seen that done much lately.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The X-Files'' (9 p.m. Sundays on Fox) _ Last season's
cliffhanger gets resolved over two shows, Sunday and Nov. 14. On
Nov. 28, Chris Carter wraps up some loose ends of his cancelled
``Millennium'' by bringing in Lance Henriksen and the Millennium
Group.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' (9 p.m. Monday on CBS) _ Ray and
family do a back-to-back dinner party crossover with ``King of
Queens,'' trying to get a little of Ray's magic to rub off. By Nov.
15, Ray is back to stewing about his and Debra's sex life.
</P>
<P>
   A VERY BIG SUNDAY
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night is what network execs call a ``train wreck,'' with
several highly-hyped shows competing. Among them: a high-kicking
new version of ``Annie'' (7 a.m. on ABC); the returns of ``The
X-Files'' (9 p.m. on Fox) and the hit game show ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' (9 a.m. on ABC); ``Leprechauns'' (9 p.m. on NBC),
``Shake, Rattle &AMP; Roll'' (9 p.m. on CBS) and Ken Burns' new
documentary ``Not For Ourselves Alone: The Story of Elizabeth Cady
Stanton and Susan B. Anthony''(8 p.m. on PBS).
</P>
<P>
   DYSFUNCTIONAL THANKSGIVINGS
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing like family to ratchet up the stress level. In
Thanksgiving episodes airing Sunday, Nov. 21:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Poor ``Felicity'' has a peaceful meal with her parents, her
two ex-boyfriends, her wacko roommate and 200-proof punch (8 p.m.
on the WB);
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Officer Boscorelli is taken hostage on ``Third Watch'' (8 p.m.
on NBC);
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Hills of ``King of the Hill'' are stranded at the airport
by a sleet storm (7:30 p.m. on Fox).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The next night, Nov. 22, on ``Ally McBeal,'' Jill Clayburgh
guest stars as Ally's mother at an ill-fated Thanksgiving dinner.
And Nov. 25, Thanksgiving, NBC's ``Friends'' and ``Frasier'' both
have new turkey-day episodes.
</P>
<P>
   BUT WAIT! THERE'S MORE!
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Glenn Close and Christopher Walken return in ``Sarah, Plain
and Tall: Winter's End'' (9 p.m. Nov. 21 on CBS).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Fox tries to horn in on ``Millionaire'' with its own game
show, ``Greed'' (8 p.m. tonight, Nov. 11 and 18), with $2 million
at stake.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Poor Pete Rose. First, ambushed by Jim Gray. Then he has to
play himself on the Nov. 15 ``Veronica's Closet'' (8:30 p.m. on
NBC). The guy is paying for his sins, no question.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Stone Cold Steve Austin is back playing Jake Cage on the Nov.
19 ``Nash Bridges'' (10 p.m. on CBS). Wouldn't it have been neater
if they'd named his character something like Percy?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The girl in the Doritos' ads (whose name happens to be Ali
Landry) continues her inexorable rise to the top on ``Two Guys and
a Girl'' (8 p.m. Nov. 17 on ABC).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Come on Get Happy: The Partridge Family Story'' (9 p.m. Nov.
13 on ABC) pretty much says it all in the title.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The scandalously under-exposed singer Ricky Martin gets his
own special (8 p.m. Nov. 26 on CBS). Gee, whatever will he sing?

BOOK TALK: AN AUTHOR IN LIMBO 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MARTIN ARNOLD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The writer Pat Jordan could be the poster boy for all the
mindless and sometimes cruel whacks that book publishing can
inflict on authors. Here's his story, but first there are certain
things about that world to be understood. For instance, an author's
nearly primordial need is for a strong editor who not only edits
the book but, as its publication date arrives, also hounds and
prods and seduces the publisher and sales force into winning the
book a good ride from the booksellers.
</P>
<P>
   What makes one book sell and another not? That's a mystery of
almost occult force, and few things could be worse for a writer
than having a book flung into the marketplace without its own
wizard, that editor or publisher champion. Without it most books
are doomed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Jordan's experience has been a continuing chronicle of
editors working with him one moment and then, shazam, gone in a
jiffy at that instant of maximum need. Three editors have done it
to him on a single book, among other terrible occurrences. Jordan
says it makes him wonder if he isn't in the grip of a band of
trolls rather than a confederation of the bookish.
</P>
<P>
   When I first heard from Jordan last May, his publisher, Golden
Books, was wallowing about in bankruptcy proceedings. His original
editor, Robert Asahina, had fled the premises to become editor in
chief at Broadway Books after nourishing Jordan's manuscript and
promising him an eight-city book reading and signing tour.
</P>
<P>
   This left Jordan's book, his ninth, ``A Nice Tuesday: A
Memoir,'' to Cassandra Jones, a young editor, with whom he was
happy. Indeed, he has been contented with all his editors, he said,
wishing only that one would stay in place. ( Jordan, who had been a
minor league pitcher, wangled a final pitching turn for a pro team
at the age of 56. That event was the spine holding together his
memoir.)
</P>
<P>
   In short order, Golden sold its adult book division to St.
Martin's Press. With it went his book, 10,000 copies of which had
already been printed by Golden Books but which now had to be
distributed by St. Martin's. Still, things were looking up, Jordan
thought. At least his new publisher had some cash.
</P>
<P>
   To add to his joy, he said, Ms. Jones was going to St. Martin's,
where she would now watch over ``A Nice Tuesday.'' But in the
diabolism of book publishing, Ms. Jones flew out of St. Martin's
after one day and landed at Regan Books, leaving the author with
what he said was a bad case of the willies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all this, 7,000 copies were sold to readers, Jordan
said, with no publishing support, no advertising or marketing and
very few reviews, and those in small publications. ``My promised
eight-city book tour was Boca Raton, 18 miles down the road from
where I live, and Miami,'' he said. ``I got zip, zero, nothing.''
But there was some good news. Robert B. Wallace, editor in chief of
St. Martin's, was to become his editor.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the present. Jordan said that St. Martin's
and Wallace had planned the paperback publication of ``A Nice
Tuesday'' for early next year, and a spokesman said this could be
any time between January and April. Several months ago the writer
sent Wallace the completed manuscript of a novel, ``A K A Sheila
Doyle,'' and a 50-page proposal for a book about Eric Show, the
former San Diego Padres pitcher who died of a drug overdose in
1994. Both seemed to have disappeared in St. Martin's black hole,
as far as Jordan and his agent could determine.
</P>
<P>
   In a puff Wallace resigned last week, saying he was embarrassed
by St. Martin's need to recall its controversial biography of
George W. Bush, a project over which he had no control. He didn't
want to be associated with such books, he said, and immediately
popped into a new job at Talk magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said of Jordan: ``In the short amount of time you worked
with him, you fell in love with him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of support'' for his paperback ``in the house,''
Wallace added.
</P>
<P>
   But apparently it was tough love, since even Wallace pummeled
the writer's psyche by not getting back to him about his novel or
his proposal, Jordan said. Such silence and therefore isolation
after a submission is to a writer what peanut butter would be to a
man dying of thirst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started at St. Martin's with a thick head of hair, but all
this has made it fall out in droves, and now my hair looks like the
spring grass,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Richardson, president and publisher of St. Martin's adult
trade division, said Tuesday: ``I don't know yet who will be his
editor because I was away last week and I'm behind on the
reassignments. We absolutely love him.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody loves him, but nothing very splendid has come of it.
Or, as Jordan says: ``I'm sitting here at home waiting. I didn't
know I was loved by Sally Richardson.''
</P>
<P>
   His agent, David Vigliano, whose job it is to hammer publishers
into line, said: ``Things are a mess with Bob Wallace leaving.
There's a lot of uncertainty, and it's pretty troubling to Pat and
to me to some extent. They should have gotten back to us several
months ago, and I've spoken to Sally and she says she's on top of
it. But just getting a response out of them has been a nightmare.''
Perhaps he should hound a bit harder.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jordan is afraid to answer the phone during business
hours. The old jiggery of book publishing could be at work, and yet
another editor will have fled.

SAN FRANCISCO VOTERS BAN ATM SURCHARGES; LEGAL BATTLE EXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RYAN KIM  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Expressing their outrage at rising costs, San
Francisco voters have banned ATM surcharges, a move that is
expected to inspire similar ATM proposals elsewhere in the country
and trigger a massive legal fight from the banking industry.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition F, which prohibits banks from charging noncustomers
who use their ATMs, passed in Tuesday's election, making San
Francisco the first jurisdiction in the nation to outlaw ATM
surcharges through public referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The states of Iowa and Connecticut and the city of Santa Monica
have already prohibited fees through administrative action on
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was scheduled to take effect 10 days after the
city's Board of Supervisors certifies election results. But banking
representatives vowed to challenge the measure in court, contending
that federal banking laws pre-empt local banking ordinances, and
that federally chartered banks are exempt from Proposition F.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the impending legal fight, supporters of Proposition F
were elated and eager to replicate the results in other cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco, as is often the case, is slightly ahead of the
curve,'' said Jon Golinger, consumer director for California Public
Interest Research Group, a sponsor of Proposition F. ``This is a
historic vote that will set a nationwide trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Barnes, campaign manager for the banker-sponsored
Coalition for ATM Choice, said the California Bankers Association
likely will file a lawsuit to block the ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other states have been preempted by federal law, and we think
that will happen in San Francisco,'' said Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   The banking industry maintains the measure will impact only 74
of the city's 868 ATMs. Barnes said these ATMs belonged mostly to
small local banks that are not federally-chartered.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the election was only one part of what consumers pay
when they withdraw money from an ATM at a bank where they don't
keep their money: the surcharge that banks place on noncustomers,
which is typically $1.50 in California.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``foreign ATM fee'' that a customer's own bank
levies for using a cash machine belonging to another financial
institution _ usually between $1 and $2 _ won't be impacted by
Proposition F.
</P>
<P>
   In most parts of the country, bank ATM surcharges didn't exist
until 1996, when credit card companies MasterCard and Visa, which
operate ATM networks, lifted bans on surcharge fees. Since then,
more than 97 percent of banks nationwide have applied the fee,
which averages about $1.20 per transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Public discontent has been rising about the extra fee, which
many felt was unjustified. Connecticut and Iowa have both enacted
similar prohibitions _ prompting court challenges that are still
unresolved _ and the Defense Department last month proposed a ban
on ATM surcharges at more than 400 military bases.
</P>
<P>
   Banks have maintained that the fee is the price of convenience.
</P>
<P>
   Bank officials said many of the ATMs, including a large number
of stand-alone machines, were put in less-trafficked places with
the understanding that the surcharge would keep them viable.
</P>
<P>
   Bank officials have said that if the ordinance survives court
challenges, they may be forced to scale back the number of their
ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano, who
tried unsuccessfully to convince the board to vote on the proposed
ordinance, said banks would be wise to hear what their customers
are telling them through Tuesday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it was a pure consumer issue,'' said Ammiano.
``Consumers will only take so much and then they will fight back.
This vote gave them the opportunity to send the banks a clear
message that this is what they want.''

   MISSGOV _ JACKSON _ Absentee ballots, two tardy counties and
possibly even the state House could decide Mississippi's next
governor after Mike Parker and Ronnie Musgrove were unable to
deliver a knockout punch in their general election showdown.
Complete, but unofficial returns early today showed the race still
tight between the two men. Results showed Musgrove with 49.5
percent to Parker's 48.6 percent, setting up the possibility that
state representatives might have to pick between the two. Such a

town hall meeting in New Hampshire to prove that Bradley's health
care plan would cost more than he claims it would. Bradley labeled
Thorpe a Gore ``partisan.'' Not so, says Thorpe, who acknowledges
he worked for Gore. ``I was just trying to treat them on equal

judge chided the student, who stood in front of a row seats filled
with turbaned mullahs from Iran's religious establishment. Nemati
had not committed murder or sedition. He was not a radical
newspaper editor or reformist politician. He was a scared
playwright, pleading his loyalty to Islam and denying charges that
his play about a Muslim holy figure was an insult. Nemati was
sentenced to three years in jail this week (Tuesday) in the latest
case of Iran's religious conservatives flexing their muscle. As
they try to stave off growing calls for reform, the conservatives
are targeting writers as well as their political opponents. The
case illustrates the
</P>
<P>
   limitations _ sometimes highly ambiguous _ faced by Iranian
writers. But, the reformers say things are improving and even site
Nemati's case as progress because it was handled in the courts and
not the streets. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

years before being considered, but Pope John Paul II has waived
that requirement. And in the streets of Calcutta where Mother
Teresa worked, enthusiasm is running high. A church panel is

LUCENT REPORTS HUGE SPEEDUP IN DATA TRANSMISSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies's $900 million June acquisition of
Marlborough-based Nexabit Networks paid its first big dividend
Wednesday, as Lucent reported that a Nexabit-bred system proved it
can move data four times faster than the world's most powerful
telecommunications gear.
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing Ltd., the new international carrier that is
taking over Frontier Communications, said a Nexabit switch/router
moved data between Cleveland and Chicago at 10 gigabits per second,
or 10 billion bits _ 300 percent faster than the industry's best
devices made by Lucent and rivals such as Cisco Systems and Nortel
Networks.
</P>
<P>
   Besides bringing at least temporary world-record bragging rights
to one of Interstate 495's hottest high-tech start-ups, the
breakthrough promises to speed the availability of high-speed,
high-quality Internet services such as watching live television or
movies by computer download.
</P>
<P>
   Mukesh Chatter, the Nexabit president and founder who is now a
senior Lucent official, said the NX64000 device will allow Net
traffic speeds to catch up to the huge gains in transmission
capacity created by improved fiber optics.
</P>
<P>
   Chatter said recent bandwidth enhancements and ``multiplexing''
devices boosting the capacity of existing wires have created the
equivalent of a 16-lane highway. But until now the cars on the road
have been able to travel only 15 or 20 miles per hour. The new
device allows them to drive 80 miles per hour, so four times as
many can drive down the highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major breakthrough,'' Chatter said. ``We are
allowing a lot more raw bandwidth to be converted to usable
bandwidth. This is like a traffic cop that can make traffic move
four times faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucent officials said AT&AMP;T is also testing a Nexabit NX64000
device to speed traffic between Cambridge, Mass. and New York City.
The Murray Hill, N.J., company said it expects to begin commercial
sales of the devices by year's end and sees a large market among
old-line phone companies, new carriers, and cable television
companies upgrading for Net traffic.

   UTILITIES-POLLUTE (Washington) _ In one of its largest

   CZECH-HAVEL (Prague, Czech Republic) _ Vaclav Havel, the ironic

bring down the Berlin Wall, still serves, like a prisoner, as
president of the Czech Republic. Celebrated in the West as a symbol
of communism's magical implosion and the force of the written word,
Havel, 10 years later, is now regarded by many Czechs as something

   NY-MARATHON-WHEELCHAIRS (New York) _ For wheelchair athletes,
the New York City Marathon has always been a bittersweet event.
Though it is the largest marathon in America, it has never had a
separate division with prizes for wheelchair athletes. Several
times over the years athletes have complained that they were held
up to let foot racers pass. This year, however, the race is being
held against the backdrop of a lawsuit filed last July in federal
court in Brooklyn, in which nine wheelchair athletes alleged that
the marathon's organizers had repeatedly discriminated against them
under the Americans with Disabilities Act. By Jesse McKinley. (With

   HOLLYWOOD-WEB (Los Angeles) _ Until now, Hollywood has used the
World Wide Web mainly to promote films and television programs,
rather than to distribute them. But a growing number of players,

entertainment on the Web, either by delivering existing movies and
television shows or by creating new programs specifically for
online viewing. The new efforts face formidable technical and
business challenges. If the efforts succeed, however, they could
shake up the Hollywood establishment. By Andrew Pollack.

 &HT;    BIGGER THAN EVER, PUBLIC SCHOOLS SEEK QUALITY NEXT
 &HT;    620&AMP;adds. With SCHOOLS-TIMELINE and SCHOOLS-DATA for release
Sunday, Nov. 7.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a century in which public education expanded
rapidly, many educators expect the focus to shift toward higher
school quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high point of the 20th century was making more education
available to more people,'' said education historian Barbara
Finkelstein of the University of Maryland. ``It also created the
greatest weakness of the system _ that we don't yet know how to
deal with the enormous amount of diversity that ensued.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1900, most children didn't finish elementary school.
Though free, universal schooling existed in theory, children who
were poor, disabled, immigrants or black were much less likely to
get into or stay at school.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most children from all those groups go to school, stay
more years, and study more days each year. Most children not only
graduate from high school, but go on to a college or career school
after that. Now colleges are more likely than grade schools to
worry about dropout rates.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom-line numbers are these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Among children 5 to 19 years old in 1900, only 56 percent of
the whites and 31 percent of the minorities were enrolled in a
school.
</P>
<P>
   _ Among that age group in 1998, 94 percent of non-Hispanic
whites and 91 percent of minorities were enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   But the growth came at a price.
</P>
<P>
   As more complex, school-taught skills became essential to the
upward mobility of young workers and to the economic
competitiveness of the nation, taxpayers and political leaders
alike agreed to spend more on the public schools. Even after
adjustments for inflation, annual spending per pupil in public
education is 15 times as high as it was at the start of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   Schools paid an educational price as well. Raising the mandatory
attendance age from 14 to 16 increased the number of reluctant
students. Secondary schools enticed those older youngsters to stay
in school and behave by offering them courses that were more
interesting than essential.
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Nation at Risk,'' a report issued in 1983, a national
commission summed up a growing national uneasiness when it warned
that ``a rising tide of mediocrity'' had engulfed the public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's apocalyptic language and debatable statistics
were defensible at the time, said the only teacher among its 18
members, Jay Sommer of New Rochelle, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission was choosing the best way to ring the alarm,''
Sommer said. ``It touched the entire nation, and many, many useful
things were done.''
</P>
<P>
   One reaction was to renew the emphasis upon traditional
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Only one-eighth of the seniors graduating from high school in
1983 had taken the core courses recommended for the college-bound _
four years of English and at least three years of science,
mathematics and social science. More than half of the graduates
have those courses on their transcripts today.
</P>
<P>
   But plenty of challenges remain. Two big ones still on the table
for the next century are to make sure that core courses really have
rigorous content, and to raise the academic ambitions and
achievements of the students _ disproportionately poor kids from
minority groups who still aren't taking such courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of debates about whether public schools are
working, but most observers at least agree that there is still a
significant and intolerable gap in learning defined by race,'' said
Joseph Viteritti, author of ``Choosing Equality: School Choice, the
Constitution and Civil Society.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``If there's one thing we need to move on with
great certainty, it's eliminating that gap.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional adds follow.)
</P>
<P>
   Many experts remain understandably leery of trying to predict
just how and when the public schools could come close to reaching
such high goals.
</P>
<P>
   After all, a nonpartisan panel concluded this year that every
state would miss next year's deadline for reaching all the ``Goals
2000'' standards initiated by President Bush and 50 state governors
at an education summit in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about the potential impact of the digital revolution
is muted by memories of a famously wrongheaded prediction by
inventor Thomas Edison. He said he believed that ``the motion
picture is destined to revolutionize our educational system and
that in a few years it will supplant largely, if not entirely, the
use of textbooks.''
</P>
<P>
   Movies, telephones, radios, filmstrips and TV sets are just a
small sample of the technological innovations that failed to
replace or transform what most Americans call ``regular schools,''
said Larry Cuban, co-author with fellow Stanford professor David
Tyack of ``Tinkering Toward Utopia: A Century of Reform in the
Public Schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Regular schools are big buildings in which each classroom has a
blackboard on the front wall and one teacher supervising the work
of a group of students of about the same age for a 36-week school
year.
</P>
<P>
   Computers just might make a dent in that pattern, Cuban said,
though school computers are generally underused. The computer is
more likely to become just one more useful tool, like several
innovations embraced by educators in this century: copy machines,
ballpoint pens, machine-scored tests, VCRs, overhead projectors,
hand-held calculators and the yellow school bus.
</P>
<P>
   But he added a caveat.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who tout one form of technology or one form of teaching
are really talking about religious faith, so to speak,'' Cuban
said. ``There is not and never will be scientific proof that one
form of teaching is better than another for all kids on all
occasions.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, the urge to peek into the future remains irresistible for
many. Here are three likely developments in the next century:
</P>
<P>
   _ The K-12 system of public schools, which provides free
education from kindergarten through 12th grade, will become a P-12
system as taxpayers pick up the tab for pre-school. Already, six
out of 10 children attend private pre-schools or day-care groups
before they enter kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   _ Free public education could even expand into a P-14 system, as
more companies pay community colleges to train or retrain workers
for specific needs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Americans will continue to gripe about the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Long before ``A Nation at Risk'' was published, the National
Association of Manufacturers complained in 1927 that 40 percent of
high school graduates could not perform simple arithmetic or
accurately express themselves in English.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty years ago, a high school diploma meant something,''
historian Arthur Bestor wrote 51 years later in U.S. News and World
Report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have simply misled our students and misled the nation by
handing out high-school diplomas to those we well know had none of
the intellectual qualifications that a high-school diploma is
supposed to represent _ and does represent in other countries,''
Bestor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something in our culture that requires us to always
believe that things are deteriorating,'' said Richard Rothstein,
author of ``The Way We Were?'' _ a book calling for restraint and
precision in debates over reforming public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Rothstein quickly added, ``When I say schools are better than
they were in the past, I'm not saying they are good enough.''

 &HT;    KEY DATES IN PUBLIC EDUCATION IN THE 20TH CENTURY
 &HT;    With SCHOOLS-CENTURY. For release Sunday, Nov. 7.
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here are major national turning points in public
education during the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   1917. The Smith-Hughes Act is passed. The first federal law
subsidizing vocational education, it adds job training to the tasks
a high school is expected to carry out.
</P>
<P>
   1918. The National Education Association publishes ``Cardinal
Principles of Secondary Education.'' It says high schools should
offer students more options to the classic academic track and
should educate them in seven areas: health, fundamental processes
(reading and arithmetic), worthy home membership, vocation,
citizenship, worthy use of leisure and ethical character.
</P>
<P>
   1935. The University of Iowa develops the standardized,
short-answer Iowa Test of Basic Skills. Its mass-scale,
machine-scored spin-offs include the GED high school equivalency
test and college admission exams.
</P>
<P>
   1939. A committee of educators, state officials and bus
engineers adopts national standards for the yellow school bus. Its
safe trips make it easier to consolidate school districts and shut
down one-room schools.
</P>
<P>
   1944. The GI bill is adopted. Offering free college educations
to millions of World War II veterans, it lowers the value of a high
school diploma in the job market.
</P>
<P>
   1946. The federal school lunch program begins.
</P>
<P>
   1954. In Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court starts
the process of dissolving the dual system of separate schools for
blacks and whites that had been required or tolerated in 21 states.
</P>
<P>
   1958. The Education of the Mentally Retarded Act is passed. Its
teacher training funds are the first federal subsidies for special
education.
</P>
<P>
   1965. The Head Start pre-school program for poor children
begins. It popularizes day care and pre-school, and tests the
concept of public education programs outside the local school
district's control.
</P>
<P>
   1965. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act is passed. It
contains the first federal aid for schools with poor children.
</P>
<P>
   1972. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 becomes law.
It forbids sex discrimination in publicly funded schools against
athletes, students, teachers or other employees.
</P>
<P>
   1975. The Education for All Handicapped Children Act is adopted.
Previously, one out of six disabled children didn't go to school.
</P>
<P>
   1983. The National Commission on Excellence in Education issues
``A Nation at Risk.'' The report warns of ``a rising tide of
mediocrity'' in public schools and inspires a drive to raise
academic standards.
</P>
<P>
   1989. At an education summit, President Bush and the 50 state
governors initiate Goals 2000, which sets national education goals
for the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
   1999. The nonpartisan National Education Goals Panel announces
that the goals won't be met by the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   _ Compiled by Andrew Mollison from Education Week; ``Tinkering
Toward Utopia'' by David Tyack and Larry Cuban; ``The Way We
Were?'' by Richard Rothstein, and ``Brookings Papers on Education
Policy, 1999,'' edited by Diane Ravitch.

`THE TINY ONE:' TEXTURES OF CHILDHOOD IN AN 8-YEAR-OLD'S GRIEF 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Mum's dead forever. It happened the day before yesterday.
Yesterday I don't really remember. Today it's trying to snow. Mum's
dead forever, and the world's all different, roomy and huge.''
</P>
<P>
   So begins, after an unnecessary prefatory chapter, the essence
of Eliza Minot's first novel, ``The Tiny One,'' a shining poetic
evocation of a child's experience of the loss of her mother. The
speaker is 8-year-old Via Mahoney Revere _ ``They were going to
name me Olivia, but they just made it Via instead because Dad knew
someone named Olivia that he didn't like'' _ who has just learned
that her mother has been killed in a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   Via can't stop thinking about the day it happened. ``I want to
hear the story again because there's a thrill in it somewhere that
I can't get enough of.'' So she recalls and retells the day in
minute detail, wondering, ``How can something so big fit into such
a little thing like a day?''
</P>
<P>
   It's an ordinary school day, but in piecing it together, Ms.
Minot plunges us back into the world of childhood, reminding and
articulating for us the wonders of discovering new tastes, smells,
sights, textures and sounds; the hugeness of physical hurts, the
terror of nightmares, the cruelty of playmates and the way a parent
can make everything right again.
</P>
<P>
   Events trigger memories for Via, an unusually bright and
sensitive little girl, and as the day progresses through art class,
reading, recess and so forth (paradoxically, it's St. Valentine's
Day), she describes the life of a large family that lives in a town
north of Boston, summers on an island off the coast of Maine, goes
skiing in New Hampshire and vacations in Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   Readers familiar with Ms. Minot's surname will recognize a world
very similar to the one created by her sister Susan in her first
novel, ``Monkeys'' (1986). Except that ``The Tiny One'' is far more
elliptical in its references to externals. You can hardly tell that
when Via's parents fight, the issue is probably her father's
drinking, or that the reason he doesn't attend church with his wife
and children is that he isn't Catholic like them.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Ms. Minot paints the interiors of experience: the fun
of picking away the crust formed by pinkeye; the prospect of a good
scab forming from a cut; the wonder of why people clap their hands
to applaud; the curiosity of strange new words; the feel of crying
on the family couch ``and when I close my eyes I'm like a dark
roller coaster going down and down and every time I swoop farther
down with a breath it's darker.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when Via describes how a teacher fetched her from math
class so that she could learn of her mother's death, what she
concentrates on is a sensuous detail, how the teacher ``took my
hand and she did it the wrong upside-down way, so I couldn't hold
her thumb mound like a handle the way I hold Mum's.''
</P>
<P>
   She continues, ``It felt backward and inside out but interesting
like when I have a dream that I can't explain but it's something
like where my foot's resting in the arch of my other foot and how
it's resting there is very important to something someone's trying
to tell me and a place I'm trying to get to but can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally such memories of Via's rise above mere observation
to the level of instructive moral experience, like an incident
where a boy pays her to kiss him. ``I have two dollars like a
grown-up,'' Via concludes with wonderful ambiguity, and her mother,
upon learning what has happened, warns her, ``Don't you ever, ever
do that again.''
</P>
<P>
   But so intense are Via's explorations of her senses that they
eventually grow faintly tedious in their repetition. All that we
have to carry us along is the anticipation that Via eventually will
be called out of class, and this knowledge hardly varies the pitch
of the narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in two intrusive chapters, one at the beginning, the
other near the end, Ms. Minot introduces an outside narrator to
describe Via's plight: ``Grief has been born boring into her soft
ripe life full of cartwheels and digging with sticks, leaves and
laughter, sky and light, her mother's face and jumps in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   This added note of pity feels gratuitous to the point of
sentimentality. The attitude seems to be further reflected in the
novel's title, which appears to rub in unnecessarily the
protagonist's vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   Yet much is redeemed by the novel's ending, where Via applies
the lesson that intense recollection has taught her. ``I feel sad
but it's like there's something shining in it,'' she explains. ``I
can find her even if she's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   She concludes: ``It's the tiny one thing in me that's at the
bottom of all the rest, that I know will never go. It's the tiny
one thing in me that will, like, hold me forever to looking for
Mum. It makes my eyes like watcher eyes. That's what's in there.
It's like the dust of magnets or something that will pull me to
her. I'll always try to see. I'll get better and better at it every
day. I'll watch and remember. I'll look. Because it keeps life from
getting lost and wondering where she went. Because it keeps life.''

   Susan B. Anthony was a teetotaler spinster, raised in a strict
Quaker home in which toys were not allowed. In photograph after
photograph she displays the stern features and cranky expression of
a woman who never had fun. Elizabeth Cady Stanton had a life, and
she enjoyed it. She loved food and clothes, and in her photographs,
as she changes from a dark-haired young mother to a plump
white-haired matron, she usually has a headful of curls.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures don't deceive, but they fail to capture what was
most original about these two. Together they led a fierce
revolution for women's rights that went far beyond getting the vote
and whose repercussions are still being felt. ``Oh, my daughter, I
wish you were a boy,'' Stanton's father told her when she was
young; he had no idea what he was letting himself in for.
</P>
<P>
   If these women seem frozen in the past, Ken Burns and Paul
Barnes' ``Not for Ourselves Alone'' brings them soaring into the
present. Burns' familiar, sometimes cloying ``Civil War'' style
(well-known actors reading reverently from the subjects' writings,
a lavish range of archival photographs, commentary from historians)
works exceptionally well here. The approach allows the filmmakers
to borrow Stanton and Anthony's eloquence, wit and passion, to
create a vibrant and extremely moving portrait of a lifelong
friendship and the political strategies that defined the women's
rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   At the start, this two-part series (to be shown Sunday and
Monday on PBS) makes an important connection between Stanton and
Anthony's era and ours. It begins with two contemporary interviews
with women born before women were allowed to vote. Ethel Hall, 100,
says: ``I remember the women suffragettes. It seemed rather bold
and unladylike to venture out into the world.'' She is a living
reminder that what we have taken for granted for generations
happened yesterday in historical terms.
</P>
<P>
   Moving back to trace Stanton and Anthony's lives, the film
smoothly reveals two opposite personalities that complemented each
other. Anthony began as a schoolteacher, then ran the family's farm
in upstate New York before spending decades on the road giving
speeches. At the time, it was shocking for a woman to travel alone
as she did, much less speak in public. Julie Harris reads Anthony's
words in a tightly wound, thin, intense voice that suits them.
``Just think, had I married at 20 I would have been a drudge or a
doll for 55 years,'' she says, with uncharacteristic wryness.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony came to be single-minded about gaining women the right
to vote, but she began as an activist for a range of issues, from
the abolition of slavery to temperance. As the film points out,
banning alcohol was then seen as a feminist cause because it would
help end domestic abuse and fathers drinking away the family food
money. One of the film's great strengths is its sense of the
breadth of the feminist movement in the late 19th and early 20th
centuries. Even then, there was no monolithic feminist thought.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton was a more complex personality and a more radical
thinker. Born into a wealthy family, she married the abolitionist
Henry Stanton and had seven children. When she teamed with Anthony,
their duties split neatly. Stanton was the writer and Anthony the
tireless orator. It was Stanton who wrote the Declaration of
Sentiments presented in 1848 at the first women's rights convention
in Seneca Falls, N.Y., demanding the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Though Anthony is the symbol of suffragism, the lesser-known
Stanton speaks more directly to our era. She balanced her family
and her public life with all the dexterity and difficulty facing
women today. Sometimes Anthony baby-sat so Stanton could write.
Ronnie Gilbert speaks Stanton's words in a voice that is calm,
embracing, softly determined. Yet at times her proposals shocked
even her supporters. Some thought she went too far when she
demanded a woman's right to sue for divorce. More cautious
feminists feared that such radicalism would cost them backing for
reforms that were easier to accomplish, like property rights.
</P>
<P>
   As they grew older, Stanton and Anthony realized that they might
not live to vote legally. Though both lived to be 86, they did not.
Only in 1920, 18 years after Stanton's death and 16 after
Anthony's, were all American women able to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Bracing and fascinating though this film is, it comes with its
disappointments. Anthony and Stanton set in motion a swirl of
issues that are still being played out, and it would have been
energizing if the film had considered some. During Elizabeth Dole's
recent short-lived campaign for the presidency, for example, she
had to decide how much or how little to play up her identity as a
woman; at what point might that alienate her more conservative
supporters? Such choices carry a strong echo of the strategic
decisions Stanton and Anthony faced. Yet in typical Burns fashion,
``Not for Ourselves Alone'' is hermetic about history, handing it
to us in a package too neatly and prettily wrapped.
</P>
<P>
   It seems odd that all the experts on screen are women, while the
producers and the writer, Geoffrey C. Ward, are men. Such a stark
fault line may have been unintentional, yet it carries an uneasy
feel of compensation rather than equality. And Burns' weakness for
treacly fiddle music is simply wrongheaded here. The tiresome music
drips with a sentimentality that works against every tough-minded
idea Stanton and Anthony ever had, thoughts that this film so
stirringly express.

MILAN SENDS A GIFT `LEONARDO' HORSE OUT TO PASTURE

<TEXT>
<P>
   MILAN, Italy _ Italy knows what to do with a gift horse: Look it
in the mouth and send it to the racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   In September the city of Milan received a large gift from
America _ a big, bronze Italian stallion, 24 feet high, inspired by
Leonardo da Vinci's unrealized dream of casting a large horse and
rider in one piece or, as Leonardo put it, through ``one and only
(one) spout.'' But the horse has been snubbed by the city. Almost
no one visits ``Il Cavallo,'' except for those who happen to be on
their way to the racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   The horse _ a sturdy, brown beast with an open mouth, a
high-stepping front leg and a swirly Tastee-Freez tail _ is not the
technological feat or the political tribute to the Sforza family
that Leonardo envisioned 500 years ago. It was not cast in one
piece but in 60 separate ones, and it is missing the rider,
Francesco Sforza, that Leonardo promised. The riderless horse
stands in an empty plaza inside the gates of Milan's Hippodrome,
the horse track, far from the city center. Taxi drivers have
trouble finding it. The nearest subway stop is a long walk.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the big horse is a white pavilion, the backside of the
racetrack's old grandstand, with placards explaining the casting of
the horse and a movie (with English subtitles and Renaissance
music) telling the ``amazing story'' of Charles Dent, the retired
airline pilot from Allentown, Pa., who latched onto the idea of
realizing Leonardo's long lost dream after reading about it in
National Geographic in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   But no one is watching the movie about the can-do pilot. And no
one is drinking at the nearby bar that was set up for visitors. The
bartender confirms that ``it's quiet around here, unless there's a
horse race on.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlo Bertelli, who was the head of the Brera Gallery and the
superintendent for the art treasures of Lombardy when the horse
project was first presented by Dent, explained why ``Il Cavallo''
has been put out to pasture.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 years ago, he recalled, Dent came to visit him and
Carlo Tognoli, then the mayor of Milan. Dent also approached other
Milanese authorities to support his equine dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to convince him it was not the thing to do,'' Bertelli
recalled. ``It was not Leonardo. It had no connection to
Leonardo.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo, of course, got a better reception. In 1482, he wrote
to Ludovico Sforza, the Duke of Milan, describing his plan for a
big horse and rider. The rider, he explained, would be a sculpture
of Ludovico's father, Francesco, and the horse, the largest ever,
would be a technological wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The construction of the horse in bronze can be carried out,''
Leonardo wrote his patron. ``It will be the immortal glory and
eternal honor of the pleasant memory of ... the glorious House of
Sforza.''
</P>
<P>
   The buttering up worked. Sforza gave him the commission, and
Leonardo made a life-size clay model. But before it could be cast
in bronze as Leonardo planned, in a single pour, through a single
spout, the clay model was demolished. In 1499, French troops
invaded, and Leonardo fled Milan, leaving his poor horse to the
Gascon bowmen, who used it for target practice.
</P>
<P>
   The horse was gone. ``There are no copies of it. There is
nothing of it left. We don't know how it appeared,'' Bertelli said.
``There are some scanty sketches of horses'' in Leonardo's
notebooks: drawings of wild horses and bucking horses and sketches
for his lost painting, ``The Battle of Anghiari.'' But there are no
molds for the big bronze horse and rider.
</P>
<P>
   That is why when Dent came to Bertelli asking for his support,
Bertelli told him that rather than trying to realize some ``fancy
idea of how the monument would have looked,'' he ``should make a
cast of something which exists,'' a real Leonardo.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Bertelli said, ``Leonardo made a very accurate
drawing of how the metal structure should be for the head and
neck'' of the horse. This drawing showed ``how an ironmonger would
make the iron structure'' to support the model. To make such a
structure according to those plans would have been great, Bertelli
said. ``It would have been a contribution, something scientific. It
would have been Leonardo.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was not what the pilot had in mind. ``He didn't like
it. It was too modest. He had this ambition of making what Leonardo
had not done.'' The problem with Dent, Bertelli recalled thinking,
was: ``You are not Leonardo.''
</P>
<P>
   So why was the gift horse accepted by Milan?
</P>
<P>
   ``To send it back, to refuse a gift, would have been rather
rude,'' Bertelli said. ``If you didn't want to receive a gift, you
had to prevent Captain Dent from making it, as I tried to do.'' But
the pilot was not discouraged and neither were his followers.
</P>
<P>
   When Dent died in 1994, the project was carried on by the
nonprofit group he founded, Leonardo da Vinci's Horse Inc. They
raised $6.5 million for the horse. In 1997, a sculptor, Nina Akamu,
modeled the horse based on Leonardo's many sketches of horses, and
in 1998 the Tallix Foundry, in Beacon, N.Y., cast it.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Tallix now sells ``Il Cavallo'' in various sizes,
from 5-inch-tall models for $750 each to 12-foot-high horses at $1
million each. An 8-foot bronze version now stands in New York City
in front of Cooper Union and will remain until Nov. 10.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the gift horse was accepted by the mayor of Milan
and sent off to the Hippodrome. ``It is far off the normal circuits
of daily life. You must go there on purpose,'' Bertelli said.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, that was not where the pilot wanted it. ``Captain
Dent wanted it inside a castle,'' Bertelli said, namely the Sforza
Castle. ``He wanted it in the most conspicuous place.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Bertelli has not been to see ``Il Cavallo'' in person.
``You go to the Hippodrome for horse races,'' he said. ``I never go
to the horse races.''

TESTING THE NEW `PRINTER/COPIERS' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMSON GARFINKLE   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Multifunction devices that combine a flatbed scanner with a high
quality color inkjet printer seem to make a lot of sense. Called
``printer/copiers,'' these devices save on desk space and give you
the ability to make a copy even if your computer is turned off. But
they have not been wildly successful in the marketplace. Xerox is
trying to change that this fall, with two new multifunction systems
aimed at home users and small businesses. Although I can't
recommend these machines, it's instructive to learn from Xerox's
mistakes _ especially if you are in the market for a scanner or a
multifunction system.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox's two machines are the XK35c and the Xi70c. Priced at $399
and $499, respectively, each looks like a standard desktop copier,
with lift-up top that covers a glass surface, room for a stack of
paper on the bottom, and front panels with several controls. But
unlike traditional photocopiers, they work by scanning the original
and then printing the copy on a built-in inkjet printer. The front
panel controls let you control the resolution of the copy, the
darkness, the number of copies, and whether the copy will be full
color or black and white.
</P>
<P>
   But similarities between the XK35c and the Xi70c are only
skin-deep. These two machines were developed by different product
groups at Xerox. They are based on different printer mechanisms,
use different software, and have different problems.
</P>
<P>
   The XK35c is designed for home users. It can connect to your
computer with either a parallel printer cable or a Universal Serial
Bus interface. Xerox says the printer can put out eight pages per
minute in black and white or three pages per minute in color. Don't
believe it. In my tests, the printer produced just one page per
minute when printing black-and-white text, and required 2 1/2
minutes to make a single color copy. Once the image is scanned,
additional copies come somewhat faster, but still nowhere near the
claimed speed.
</P>
<P>
   Installing the XK35c was problematic. Although the USB is
supposed to be plug-and-play, Xerox's software wouldn't work
properly unless I first inserted the CD-ROM and ran the installer
program, rebooted my system, then plugged the printer into my
computer. But once everything was in place, the printer functioned
reasonably well.
</P>
<P>
   The XK35c scanner, by contrast, didn't work well at all. Because
it uses TWAIN, the software is supposed to let you use the scanner
from any Windows application. In my experience, though, the XK35c's
TWAIN driver occasionally crashed and refused to work until I
rebooted my computer.
</P>
<P>
   The Xi70c is designed for business users. It is larger than the
XK35c, has a faster print engine, and has ink cartridges that hold
more ink than the XK35c. In what I think is a major oversight, the
Xi70c doesn't have a USB interface. The first Xi70c that Xerox sent
me arrived damaged; I'm not sure whether this reflects a poor
choice of shipping companies (Xerox used DHL) or a fragile print
assembly, but it is the first piece of equipment that I've received
in the past three years that was damaged in shipment.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the Xi70c to run with my desktop system was a nightmare.
I tried for several hours and never got it to print or scan. Xerox
said there probably was a conflict between some program on my
desktop and the machine. I had better luck when I installed the
printer software on my laptop. But even on the laptop, the scanner
software remained nonfunctional.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of going with one of these Xerox multifunction devices,
another choice is to simply buy a traditional inkjet printer and a
separate low-cost desktop scanner. This gives you all the same
features as the Xerox machines except the convenience of making a
copy without turning on your computer.
</P>
<P>
   One new scanner that deserves particular mention is IBM's new
IdeaScan 2000. It's lightweight, low profile, full-color, and
100-percent USB. (If you don't have a USB interface for your
desktop computer, buy one: They cost less than $60 each.) The
scanner has an optical resolution of 600 x 1200 dots per inch,
fairly typical as scanners go. There are five attractive
push-buttons on its front: one performs a scan, one cancels the
scan, and the other three provide one-button access to copying,
faxing, and a program of your choice. The scanner costs $169 and
can be ordered from IBM's Web site, www.ibm.com/shop.
</P>
<P>
   IBM has done a pretty good job with its TWAIN software: I had no
problems using the scanner's driver from a number of different
programs. The scanner also comes with a version of PaperPort, which
is magnificent for scanning and managing scanned images.
</P>
<P>
   Integrated machines such as the Xerox XK35c and Xi70c have a lot
of promise. I really enjoyed the ability to drop a piece of paper
onto the glass, push a button, and get a copy.
</P>
<P>
   But as general peripherals for a desktop computer, the
all-in-one machines still have significant problems. With color
becoming more important for both business and at the home, it makes
sense to have both a scanner and a color copier. For now, however,
I recommend that you keep these machines in separate boxes.

IN GALLOPING HIGH-TECH WORLD, ONE PART CAN'T KEEP CURRENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It almost seems like a law of nature. Computers, and other
high-tech devices that rely on microchips, just keep getting
faster, smaller, and more powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad the same can't be said about batteries. The most
powerful laptop computer or the most stylish cell phone is useless
unless its battery pack can deliver a long-lasting stream of power.
But experts in the electronics industry admit that today's
batteries fall short. Worse yet, they warn that a major improvement
is nowhere in sight. And that means that electronic devices meant
to liberate us from our desktops still leave us chained to the wall
socket.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a practical solution in view that would provide a
dramatic increase'' in battery performance, says Antoni Gozdz,
chief battery scientist at Telcordia Technologies Inc., formerly
Bellcore, a research arm of the old nationwide Bell telephone
system.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Gozdz and his colleagues are giving up. From the campus
of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to the labs of the
world's top battery makers, scientists are tinkering with an array
of advanced materials. They're hoping to find a magical combination
of elements that could produce a steady stream of electrical power
from a package that's smaller and lighter than today's batteries.
</P>
<P>
   And they've made progress. Morristown, N.J.-based Telcordia, for
instance, played a major role in developing the most common type of
rechargeable battery used in today's phones and computers. These
batteries deliver two to three times the power of early
rechargeable batteries. But they still don't provide enough juice
to run the typical laptop on a flight from Boston to San Francisco,
let alone deliver long-term power to next-generation devices such
as cell phones that display color Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   The amazing improvement in electronics performance is driven by
Intel Corp. cofounder Gordon Moore's famous dictum that the number
of transistors that can be squeezed onto a chip _ and hence the
chip's computing power _ will double every 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   But while the chipmakers revel in the benefits of Moore's Law,
battery makers are governed by statutes that are far less
forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is electrochemistry, not pure electronics. So there are
limiting factors,'' says Ian Irving, executive vice president of
Battery Engineering Inc. in Canton, which makes specialized
rechargeables for the military.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have been pushing against the limits of batteries for
two centuries. The first modern one was devised in 1800 by an
Italian scientist with a familiar-sounding name _ Alessandro Volta.
</P>
<P>
   A battery is basically an electrical generator that uses a
chemical reaction instead of a mechanical dynamo to create current.
Two electrodes, made of materials with different electrical
charges, such as zinc and carbon, are immersed in an electrolyte, a
substance that transmits electricity. If you attach a wire between
the two electrode, electrons begin to flow. And you can run an
electrical device by tying it into this circuit. It's like carrying
packaged electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, you have to carry the package around.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I just wanted to get myself about five amp-hours of
electrons, it weighs almost nothing. It's all the other stuff,''
says Don Sadoway, a professor of materials science at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other stuff'' includes electrodes large enough to produce
plenty of current. There's also the electrolyte, which is usually a
liquid or gel. And then there's the ``battery can,'' a case that
must be able to hold everything together without allowing the
often-toxic electrolyte to leak out. As much as 30 percent of a
battery's weight comes from the can, which produces no power at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Tote it all up, and then factor in the amount of juice the
battery produces. The resultant figure, called ``energy density,''
is the amount of power per ounce delivered by the battery.
</P>
<P>
   Batteries have definitely improved in this area. Today's
alkaline batteries are far more powerful than older batteries of
the same size, made using carbon and zinc. In the realm of
rechargeables, most portable devices now use a chemistry based on
the element lithium, along with oxidized cobalt dipped in an
electron-friendly gel. These ``lithium ion'' batteries have more
than twice the energy density of the older nickel-cadmium
rechargeables.
</P>
<P>
   One of the earliest laptop computers, like an old Radio Shack
TRS-80, would run for quite a long time with one of today's lithium
ion batteries. But the TRS-80 had a drab black-and-white display,
and no hard drive or DVD drive to rapidly drain the battery.
Meanwhile, growing numbers of cellular phones and pocket digital
devices like the PalmPilot are adding features such as color
display screens and the ability to get e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want full-color displays, they want to be able to read
text, they want to go to wireless Internet,'' says MIT's Sadoway.
``We're going to find that we have a very powerful wireless device
that runs for an unacceptable period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Electrical engineers have taken pity on their electrochemist
brethren. They're trying to ease the pressure by finding ways to
increase computing power without increasing electrical consumption.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have maintained essentially the same active power level on
our microprocessors'' since 1997, says Intel Corp. vice president
Frank Spindler, who oversees marketing of Santa Clara, Calif.-based
Intel's chips for portable computers. For one thing, Intel _ along
with nearly everybody else _ is moving to new manufacturing
processes to make their chips much smaller. Simply reducing the
size of the chip cuts its power consumption.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Intel has come up with some impressive
energy-saving tricks. The mobile versions of the company's Pentium
II and Pentium III chips actually power themselves down for
fractions of a second whenever they're idle. Type a word on one of
these laptops, and the processor will go to sleep between your
keystrokes.
</P>
<P>
   Gimmicks like these help extend battery life. But they do
nothing to transcend the basic limits of battery technology. The
battery guys keep plugging away, but they warn that there are no
Moore's Law-type miracles in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Irving of Battery Engineering can't conceive of a practical
battery material that will outperform today's lithium-based
devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't anything that has the capability of producing
batteries necessarily any more capable than lithium,'' says Irving.
``The raw material currently doesn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that lithium batteries can't be improved. MIT's Sadoway and
others are working on a variation of the concept _ lithium polymer
batteries with an electrolyte that's solid instead of liquid. Such
a battery won't need the heavy battery can. Sadoway foresees
batteries the thickness of a potato chip bag; he's even made a
prototype capable of running a transistor radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our idea is to make the battery so small and light, you don't
even have a battery compartment any more,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, lithium polymer batteries don't actually produce more
power than existing rechargeable battery technology. Chuck
Kuhlmann, lead battery technologist for IBM Corp. in Raleigh, N.C.,
says the energy densities of batteries will have to increase by a
factor of 10 to keep up with the stuff he and his colleagues would
like to invent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think that we'll get a breakthrough,'' Kuhlmann says.
But he has no idea where it will come from.

ELECTRONIC BANKING FITS THE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's getting tough to be a member of the Internet elite, now
that 40 percent of Americans are on line. Snobs like me find it
more difficult to stand apart from the common herd. Almost every
time I learn of some flashy Internet service, it turns out many of
you have gotten there ahead of me.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's on-line banking, a wonderfully useful concept
that most of you have ignored. It seems that only 4.5 percent of us
paid bills over the Internet last year, according to the Yankee
Group, a Boston research firm. I'm one of that happy few; I began
using an on-line banking service in 1996, and I've never regretted
it.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I'm not quite at the cutting edge. I don't use one of
the true Internet banks, like Security First Network Bank. Now
owned by Royal Bank of Canada, Security First (www.sfnb.com) was
the first bank to exist entirely on line. No offices, no vaults, no
teller windows, nothing but Net. No thanks.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer the reassurance of bricks and mortar. But my bank, like
dozens of others, allows me to check balances and write checks from
my home computer, with the aid of Intuit Corp.'s Quicken financial
software package.
</P>
<P>
   When bills show up in the mailbox, I start up Quicken. The
addresses and account numbers are already typed in. I just fill in
the amounts, weep quietly over my depleted bank balance, then log
onto the Net and electronically issue the payments.
</P>
<P>
   And here's where it gets interesting. If you're paying bills
electronically, shouldn't the money arrive instantly, sort of like
an e-mail message? Well, it doesn't. Many companies have no way of
accepting electronic payments. In that case, Intuit sends the
payments to a facility in Utah, which prints and mails the checks.
If you're paying your local plumber, the payment would arrive
quicker if you'd mailed it yourself. You may need to pay your bills
earlier if you do it electronically.
</P>
<P>
   Some big companies now accept direct electronic payments, which
helps, but not as much as you'd think. Electronic payments are
handled by a clearinghouse system that processes the data in
batches. Your payment won't just get zapped directly to the phone
company _ it still has to ``clear.'' And that can take a couple of
days.
</P>
<P>
   So why bother with electronic bill payment? The sheer
convenience of it. Your software remembers addresses, account
numbers, and amounts; you have a permanent record of the bills
you've paid. Sending out a new batch of checks is as easy as
pushing a few buttons.
</P>
<P>
   It's so convenient, in fact, that a horde of companies are
offering up Net-based bill payment systems that don't require
special software like Quicken. Any old Web browser will do.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic Funds &AMP; Data Corp. of Southampton, N.Y., offers a
service called Jackdough (www.jackdough.com) that aims to create a
new generation of electronic bankers. Jackdough is available
exclusively to college students. And unlike other computer
bill-paying services, it's free. The site provides links to music
and book stores, and even a credit counseling service. Chief
executive Gary Glanz is hoping to turn young kids into lifelong
customers, then try to peddle them mortgages and car loans when
they graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Another high-profile competitor, Paytrust.com of Princeton,
N.J., hopes to transform the bill-paying process.
</P>
<P>
   For $7.95 a month, Paytrust subscribers won't get bills in the
mail. Instead, they all go straight to Paytrust (www.paytrust.com),
which displays them on an encrypted, password-protected Web page.
The system also fires off an e-mail notice. To make a payment, the
user types in the amount and the payment date. Paytrust deducts the
money from an existing bank account. Users can even tell the
service to make certain payments automatically _ rent or mortgage,
say.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also trying to take the next step in the process
_ the complete elimination of paper bills. They're working to
develop a system to let companies submit their bills
electronically.
</P>
<P>
   With computers in more than half of all homes, it's a mystery to
me why we aren't all using some form of on-line banking. And yet,
if everybody did it, it just wouldn't be as cool.

DIGITAL SCRATCH 'N SNIFF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Be forewarned: This column is about a new technology that really
stinks. And if it actually works, that's a compliment.
</P>
<P>
   Two California entrepreneurs, Dexster Smith and Joel Lloyd
Bellenson, have invented a form of digital Scratch 'n Sniff, making
it possible to transmit smells over the Internet. If their company,
Digiscents Inc., takes off, you will be able to send stink bombs
that really stink, receive spam that really smells like Spam, and
transmit steamy love letters that really emit the scent of, well,
steam.
</P>
<P>
   This may sound like something out of a wacky sci-fi novel (or a
John Waters movie), but it isn't a hoax. The device attaches to
your computer and picks up coding embedded in Web pages, e-mail,
video games, or DVDs. It converts the digital signals into a full
spectrum of scents that breeze out of the box. The gizmo, which
won't be released until spring of 2000, is simply called iSmell.
That's not a joke either.
</P>
<P>
   The in-your-face name conjures up images of kids sending
messages sprinkled with a certain toilet water. ``Obviously, people
will get a hoot out of it for a while, but hopefully we can satisfy
the juvenile impulses enough so people can focus on it as an art
form,'' says Bellenson.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to imagine how digital smell could be used by the
advertising industry _ as well as the adult entertainment industry.
``You had to bring that up,'' Smith says with a groan. ``Sex is a
natural thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But an art form? ``Smells transport you to another place
mentally,'' says Bellenson. ``Say you've just come back from Bali
or Paris or wherever you've been. You remember the smells of the
meat on the sticks, the incense, the diesel of the car, the bakery.
The smells intensify the memories.''
</P>
<P>
   The folks at Digiscents have even hired a staff psychologist as
vice president of research and development. ``People invest smells
with meaning,'' says Dr. Avery Gilbert, an expert in human odor
perception. ``We are going to open up a whole new area of
creativity as we take smell as a symbol and unhinge it from its
literal origins.'' A pause. ``Oh God, I sound like a French
philosopher.''
</P>
<P>
   French philosophy, it's not. But it is a scientific fact that
smell operates differently from the other senses; smells
communicate directly with the limbic system, the part of the brain
associated with emotions. As such, the addition of smell to a
multimedia event can heighten the experience. The entrepreneurs
have already created what they call ``scent tracks'' to accompany
such vintage movies as ``The Wizard of Oz,'' in which viewers can
actually smell the forest, as well as the flying monkeys. They're
not saying what perfume the Wicked Witch wears, but you can only
just imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Word has it that they're already working on a signature for
video game superstar Lara Croft. Talk about total immersion.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time the entertainment industry has flirted
with scentsational effects. Back in the 1950s, Hollywood producers
experimented with Scentavision and Smell-a-Vision, in which odors
were released in synch with a film. Needless to say, that
experiment took a quick nosedive. Then, in 1981, Waters released
his campy spoof ``Polyester,'' starring Divine and presented in
what the flamboyant director called ``Odorama.'' It was about as
high-tech as it was highbrow: Audience members received Scratch 'n
Sniff cards to be used during particularly fulsome moments.
</P>
<P>
   Bellenson, 35, never saw ``Polyester.'' ``I was never into
Scratch 'n Sniff either, but I was made fun of as a kid for having
a big nose,'' he admits. ``Really. The nose knows.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Smith came up with the idea for the iSmell when they were
vacationing at Miami's South Beach. You know the scene: beautiful
people. Scanty clothes. Sweet scents. Sensory overload. ``The
smells were hitting us, and it had a profound impact,'' Bellenson
recalls. ``It really affects your body.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Digiscents was born. ``We should get out more often,''
says Bellenson of the original epiphany. Since the company issued a
press release last week and hit the cover of Wired magazine, it has
been inundated with queries. Some callers are incredulous. Others
are fascinated. Some are horrified: Aren't those perfume ads that
fall out of magazines bad enough?
</P>
<P>
   The Digiscents partners point out that users will always have
the option of turning the device off. But Bellenson is convinced
that a new art form is about to emerge. ``This is a whole new
sensory aspect that you're not used to having stimulated,'' he
says. ``When the first telephone was developed it was bizarre. When
the phonograph came out, people thought there were little tiny
people in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The telephone, the phonograph, and the iSmell? We're not holding
our breath, at least not yet. But if this column had a scent track,
Bellenson would be wearing Aqua de Gio, and Smith would emit the
scent of Basala by Shiseido. As for the psychologist, his scent
remains anonymous, although it's probably something French.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  Along with the rest of the world, we were thrilled to learn
that Encyclopaedia Britannica had opened its vault of information
to the world on a new free Web site. But the site was so
overwhelmed with traffic on its first day of operation that it
crashed within a few hours. The site (www.britannica.com) posted a
note of apology, reporting a ``tidal wave of activity'' and a
promise to resolve the technical problems. Luckily, we could look
up ``limbic system'' the old-fashioned way.

COMMENTARY: WHAT'S THE NEXT BIG THING?
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By ANDREW J. GLASS  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Twenty years ago, the first movie ever to spin
through my newly purchased Sony VCR was ``This Is the Army,'' an
Irving Berlin 1943 Technicolor musical in which Ronald Reagan seeks
to bolster the war effort. The Betamax cassette, via mail order,
cost $99.95.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, I watched ``This Is the Army'' via the Internet
for free. The demo wasn't perfect. But it was like the story of the
talking dog: it may not have had much to say, but the important
thing is that it could talk at all.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next June, MeTV.com plans to transmit thousands of
flicks through cyberspace at $1.99 a pop. The people behind this
new venture know that few folks will want to view full-length
feature films on their monitors. So the movie rentals will come
with a wireless device that will beam them through walls or floors
into TV sets or home theater units.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Hollywood studios, it will be just another
distribution channel,'' said Martin French, MeTV's marketing
director. ``It will be possible,'' he claimed, ``for 100,000
viewers to see the same movie at home at the same time. No VCR
rental store can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, there's a catch. For MeTV to do its thing, you'll
need an Internet link that's at least six times faster than today's
most common modems. And for the films to look and sound really
good, you'll need one, like mine, that's 16 times as fast as the
current standard.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, all signs indicate that these blazingly fast
pipelines into the home will be the Next Big Thing to hit the
Internet. Several recent studies predict that by 2002, upwards of
10 million U.S. homes will be equipped with so-called broadband
devices such as cable modems, digital subscriber lines, wireless
systems or satellite links.
</P>
<P>
   Video streaming technologies are still so novel that fewer than
50 outfits _ most of them relative unknowns, such as MeTV _ have
signed up for a Dec. 7 industry trade show in Silicon Valley. But
it should come as no surprise that Bill Gates will keynote this
event. Although the Microsoft chairman's image has reached mythic
heights, Gates has an ear to the ground for the Next Big Thing.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lewis takes up much the same theme in his latest book,
``The New New Thing,'' (Norton) which seeks to capture the
millennial feel of Silicon Valley in the same sense that his former
best-seller, ``Liar's Poker,'' evoked the ethos of Wall Street in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In his preface, Lewis writes: ``The new new thing is a notion
that is a tiny push away from general acceptance and, when it gets
that push, will change the world.''
</P>
<P>
   As Lewis sees it, that could be a radically different way of
delivering medical services to millions of Americans, one that
could shake up the nation's $1.3 trillion health care industry. Or
perhaps it could be Me-TV's vision of delivering razor-sharp movies
into millions of homes with a mouse click or two.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, we haven't progressed much in making better movies
than ``This Is the Army.'' But then again, as Lewis notes,
``progress does not march forward like an army on parade; it crawls
on its belly like a guerrilla.''

`INSIDER' A GRIPPING DRAMA
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
(Eds: FOR USE FRIDAY, NOV. 5 or thereafter). 
(fact box at bottom) 
 
 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stirring in some respects, simplistic in others, Michael Mann's
``The Insider'' is a consistently interesting and often
electrifying look at a true story of big tobacco, media ethics and
a prickly, peculiar whistle-blower. Clocking in at two hours, 44
minutes, the film could have benefited from judicious editing and a
greater sense of responsibility from its creators. For while ``The
Insider'' laments the sliding standards of news reporting, the
movie itself fictionalizes events and distorts facts in the name of
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, ``The Insider'' is just a movie, and filmmakers
rarely concern themselves with truth when it gets in the way of
good drama. News organizations have (supposedly) more rigorous
principles, which is why the real story ``The Insider'' is based
upon is so compelling.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, ``60 Minutes,'' the standard of excellence in
television news reporting, did the unthinkable _ its producers
caved to corporate pressures and gutted a damning story about the
tobacco industry. Hung out to dry in the process was their star
witness, Jeffrey Wigand, a former tobacco industry executive, a man
who had put everything on the line to testify that cigarette
companies were a ``delivery service for nicotine.''
</P>
<P>
   The film revolves around the relationship between Wigand
(Russell Crowe, subtly powerful) and hard-charging ``60 Minutes''
producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), who woos Wigand with the same
fervor that political candidates. In the opening minutes of the
film, Wigand, chief of research and development at Brown &AMP;
Williamson Tobacco Co., is fired from his job (too outspoken,
doesn't work well with others) and forced to sign a confidentiality
agreement as part of his severance package.
</P>
<P>
   The package is important. Wigand is a husband and father; his
wife has expensive tastes and one of his two daughters has serious
medical problems. Wigand is willing to shut up and walk away, but
then his old boss (Michael Gambon, effectively ominous) calls and
wants to expand the terms of the non-disclosure agreement. And
Wigand _ an intense sort who doesn't like being told what to do _
snaps. He won't tolerate deception or bullying.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Bergman. As the legman for star correspondent Mike
Wallace, Bergman has won over Islamic terrorists to the cause of
``60 Minutes,'' but Wigand proves a trickier source. Initially,
Bergman just wants Wigand to explain some tobacco-related documents
that were left on his doorstep. But Wigand, motivated by personal
vindication, gradually reveals more, becoming a golden source
worthy of Wallace's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Wigand's former employer, Brown &AMP; Williamson (the third largest
tobacco company in the nation), doesn't appreciate his
truth-telling and bombards him with lawsuits. Wigand also receives
death threats, and his already shaky marriage (Diane Venora,
perfectly aloof as the wife) cracks even further.
</P>
<P>
   The ``60 Minutes'' interview, Wigand believes, will be his
exoneration. So imagine his dismay when CBS News bows to corporate
pressure and pulls the story. Wigand feels betrayed (moral outrage
is his specialty), as does Bergman, who accuses Wallace
(Christopher Plummer) and ``60 Minutes'' executive producer Don
Hewitt (Philip Baker Hall) of selling out to the suits.
</P>
<P>
   All of this makes for some fairly riveting drama, and Mann,
always adept at creating suspense, depicts Wigand's dark journey
into heroism with a potent mixture of fear and dread. But in his
determination to make Wigand's story into a Watergate-like
watershed, Mann occasionally overplays his hand and overextends his
welcome. He creates conflict where there was none (Wallace fought
for the piece as much as Bergman did) and invents unnecessary
episodes (the death threat scenes are wildly exaggerated).
</P>
<P>
   None of this diminishes ``The Insider's'' achievement as an
entertainment. The performances are sharp and the story is told
with consummate flair. But as history goes, it's from the ``JFK''
school _ all smoke and mirrors. &QL;

Squash the rumor that winter beauties are for decoration only 
By Betty Parham  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A basket of winter squash can be so aesthetically pleasing that
it's tempting to grab a paintbrush, a camera or even a lump of clay
before thinking of putting them into a pot to cook.
</P>
<P>
   From deepest green and gold to yellow and chartreuse, orange,
russet and even blue, these natural sculptures of autumn could be
equally at home in an art gallery as in the supermarket. Perhaps
because they steal the show from other autumn produce, winter
squash are all too often appreciated solely as decorative art
rather than as wonderful food.
</P>
<P>
   Those gorgeous piles of brilliantly colored, exotically shaped
fruit tend to intimidate folks who assume that, because they're so
varied, each has to be treated differently. Not so. With the
exception of spaghetti squash, most winter squash are handled
alike.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that doesn't mean they all taste alike. The flesh,
textures, aromas and flavors of winter squash vary widely. Most
marry well with nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, cloves, curry and sage
and can be baked, boiled, mashed, pureed, steamed, simmered or
stuffed.
</P>
<P>
   Winter squash is a fruit well worth getting to know. With a few
minutes on the Internet, instead of just admiring them, you can get
to know their names, experiment with recipes and add beauty as well
as taste to your winter table.
</P>
<P>
   To begin your journey, visit ``The Old Country Market'' at
www.specialtyproduce.com
</P>
<P>
   /ConsumerProduct.asp?iItemID &QC; 452 before you go to your
supermarket. This is a great site that has encyclopedic information
about scores of fruits and vegetables, and, best of all, there are
color pictures. Scroll down to ``squash'' to get to know some
varieties you've probably seen and admired without knowing their
names.
</P>
<P>
   After you've familiarized yourself with appearances, go to
www.diabetes.org/nutrition
</P>
<P>
   /article091598.asp for a brief overview of the most common
types. You'll learn that:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Acorn is probably the most familiar winter squash. It's the
smallest, with a deep seed cavity ideal for stuffing. An
average-size acorn squash is enough for two servings.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Butternut squash has a smooth skin and looks like a tan,
elongated pear. Butternuts have a moist, sweet taste with creamy,
reddish-gold pulp. They weigh from 1/2 to 3 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard squash, a favorite of New England settlers, is a large,
football-shaped beauty. Its lumpy skin can be dark green, light
gray-blue, creamy white or pumpkin orange. All have bright yellow
pulp. They weigh from 3 to 8 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Turkish Turban is the most colorful squash, having a bright
orange rind with deep green, white and yellow splashes. It looks
like a flattened pumpkin and is attractive baked whole.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Buttercup squash is turbanlike in shape, with a light green cap
on a dark green base. The pulp is creamy yellow.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Cushaw squash is globe-shaped at one end, tapering to a narrow,
curved neck. The skin looks like a striped, green watermelon, and
the pulp is white gold.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Spaghetti squash is perhaps the most fun to prepare. The pulp
cooks up into golden yellow strands that are pulled from the
shells. Blimp-shaped, spaghetti squash makes a great substitute for
pasta. This is the only squash that cannot be used interchangeably
with others in most recipes, because of its unique strands. For
information about preparing spaghetti squash, see
soar.Berkeley.EDU/recipe
</P>
<P>
   /vegetables/squash/recipe51.rec.
</P>
<P>
   Now you're ready to make your selection. Choose the squash that
are most pleasing to the eye, knowing that they can be arranged in
a basket for up to two months and used through the season. They
should have hard, deep rinds, with no blemishes or moldy spots.
Avoid tender skin, which indicates the fruit was picked too soon.
Squash should feel heavy for its size: If it's lightweight, it
indicates that the insides have begun to dry.
</P>
<P>
   When it's time to get down to the business of preparation, go to

all types. For an excellent site with a consumer guide, a cooking

   Acorn Squash
</P>
<P>
   With Cranberry Filling
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings Preparation time: 5 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 17-22 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Here's a beautiful, easy recipe for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   2 large acorn squash (about 2 pounds each)
</P>
<P>
   1 (16-ounce) can whole cranberry sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon honey
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
</P>
<P>
   Prick squash several times with a fork to allow steam to escape.
Place in a microwave oven and microwave on high (100 percent) until
soft when tested with a fork, 10 to 12 minutes. (If the oven
doesn't have a carousel, rotate and turn the squash midway through
the cooking time.) Let stand until cool enough to handle. Cut
squashes in half. Remove and discard the stringy pulp and seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Place two halves, cut sides up, into a 10-inch square casserole
dish. Set aside the other halves.
</P>
<P>
   In a small, microwave-safe bowl, mix the cranberry sauce, honey
and allspice. Microwave on high (100 percent) until hot and bubbly,
3 to 4 minutes, stirring after half the cooking time.
</P>
<P>
   Spoon half the mixture into the two squash halves, reserving
half for the other two halves. Microwave on high (100 percent)
until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining halves.

AMA AND 6 OTHERS SET UP MEDICAL INTERNET COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Medical Association and six other medical societies
said Thursday that they had created an Internet company that,
starting next year, will publish consumer information on health
care and help doctors set up their own medical Web sites to
communicate with patients by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Medem.com, a for-profit company, enters a crowded field of
Internet medical information companies that includes DrKoop.com,
Healtheon and Medscape, as well as 17,000 other World Wide Web
sites devoted to health care information.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward Fotsch, a former emergency-room physician from
Sausalito, Calif., who is Medem's chief executive, said doctors
need a reliable source of information for patients, and by bringing
together seven medical societies, the company would provide it.
</P>
<P>
   Some medical Web sites provide information that ``is great, some
is so-so and some of it will probably kill you if you follow it,''
Fotsch remarked. Doctors, he said, ``certainly don't have the time
to read every page of information from an Internet start-up
company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going to refer patients,'' he continued, ``you have
to have confidence in that information, sight unseen.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Healtheon and Medscape said their medical
information was developed under the same standard that Medem
proposes to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of who trusts what, our track record shows we are
trusted,'' said Dr. George Lundberg, editor in chief of Medscape,
which he said had 300,000 doctors and 1.2 million other users.
Lundberg, a former editor of the Journal of the American Medical
Association, noted that he was instrumental in formulating those
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon said it was ``the pre-eminent source of trusted
content for physicians and consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Upah, chief operating officer of DrKoop.com, said his
site had become the leading medical information Web site by posting
medical content reviewed by other doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Medem will get its editorial content through a separate,
nonprofit organization called called Medem E, a separation intended
to insure its integrity, said Dr. William Mahood of Abington, Pa.,
an AMA trustee.
</P>
<P>
   Five percent of Medem is owned by a charity, called the Medem
Trust, that will use its profits to provide health care to the
poor, Fotsch said.
</P>
<P>
   While Medem is owned by the seven medical societies, Fotsch said
he expected other professional societies to join, with groups
representing osteopaths and chiropractors to apply to be owners.
``The board wants to be inclusive,'' he said, adding that the
company's charter banned only tobacco companies from involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he said, ownership stakes may be sold to investors
or even to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The imprimatur of major medical societies, representing more
than 400,000 of the nation's 650,000 doctors, is likely to help
Medem attract both advertisers and providers of health care
services.
</P>
<P>
   It may also have links to other sites like Healtheon, which
wants to digitize the paperwork now required of doctors and
patients to collect insurance payments, issue and renew
prescriptions, and store treatment records. Until last week, Fotsch
was a vice president of Healtheon, which was hired by the medical
societies to draw up the Medem business plan.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the AMA, the other Medem owners are the American
College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology; the American Academy of
Ophthalmology; the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists; the American Academy of Pediatrics; the American
Society of Plastic Surgeons, and the American Psychiatric
Association.

ETHICS AND ANIMALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Animal-rights extremists, having failed to convince most people
that chimps, rabbits, and white mice are the moral equivalent of
human beings, have taken to terrorist tactics in an effort to
prevent medical experiments on animals. If more respectable groups
in the movement want to maintain their credibility, they need to
disassociate themselves from these coercive tactics before someone
is killed or seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ingrid Newkirk, president of People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals, wrote a letter to the Globe that seemed to
condone the latest incidents, in which medical researchers received
letters that contained razor blades. ``If experimenters feel afraid
now, that is nothing compared with the fear, harm, and death they
have inflicted on their victims,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   She later acknowledged that the razor mailings were wrong but
expressed frustration that these get all the attention. ``We work
every day,'' she said, to get researchers ``to rethink what they
are doing. You won't see that get an inch of print.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly animals should be treated humanely, but animal
subjects are often necessary in experiments to develop medicines
that will save or improve human life.
</P>
<P>
   At Harvard's primate center in Southborough, where several
researchers were targeted, tests are underway on an AIDS vaccine,
an early test for Parkinson's disease, and treatments for drug
addictions. They have safeguards to make sure the animals are not
maltreated, but their prime goal is, as it should be, the
betterment of humankind.
</P>
<P>
   An extremist group that calls itself ``Justice Department,''
which took responsibility for the razor blades, has a different
priority: to prevent ``animal exploitation.'' Whether their goal is
the unreasonable one of banning animal experimentation or the
worthy one of opposing mistreatment of animals, the group's members
ought to use their human faculties to persuade, not threaten.
Medical researchers need to focus on improving human lives without
having to worry that dangerous objects might appear in the mail.

SIGNATURES ON CYBERSPACE'S DOTTED LINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What began as a seemingly simple attempt to
stimulate electronic commerce by giving so-called digital
signatures the legal weight of their ink-and-paper counterparts has
erupted into a partisan political battle in Congress that opponents
fear could wipe out some basic consumer protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digital signatures'' refers to various technologies including
encryption, fingerprint readers and stylus pads that are used to
verify one's identity in cyberspace to certify contracts that are
agreed to over the Internet. They are accepted as legally binding
in some states and localities, but not in all.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was originally meant to create a uniform federal
law recognizing the validity of digital signatures. But lately it
has been expanded in ways that critics say would work against
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are the thousands of state and local laws that require
institutions like banks and insurance companies to keep certain
paper records and to notify customers by mail of certain
situations, including default on their credit-card debts or loans;
changes in the terms of a financial agreement, like increases in a
monthly payment; foreclosure of a home mortgage; or cancellation of
an insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation pending in both the House and the Senate,
such companies would be able to make those notifications
electronically, instead of by mail, if the contracts were made
online instead of on paper. The companies would also be relieved of
a number of paper record-keeping rules.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the measures would enable companies and their
customers to realize the full benefits and conveniences of
electronic commerce. Not only would the legislation make it easier
for consumers to complete transactions from home, they say, but it
would cut down on paper and mailing expenses, helping reduce the
shipping costs that are passed on to customers.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents fear that the proposals will allow companies to
sidestep longstanding consumer notification laws.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers, they say, may not know that the fine print of their
contract eliminates the requirement for traditional notification.
Or they may simply never get crucial information if their computers
break down or they change their Internet service provider or e-mail
address _ which typically has no forwarding-address procedure as
does traditional mail.
</P>
<P>
   Or, the opponents contend, companies can include contract fine
print requiring that consumers periodically check a World Wide Web
site for updates on their agreements, a provision that many may
overlook or forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad public policy,'' said Andrew Pincus, general counsel
for the Commerce Department. ``It's also bad for the Internet. If
the online world is not safe for consumers, what does that do to
the future of electronic commerce? It goes in the tank.''
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department had given approval earlier this year to
a bill on validation of electronic signatures by Sen. Spencer
Abraham, R-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The department's support came after he agreed to reduce its
scope so that the bill would be temporary, applied to the handful
of states that did not already have laws recognizing the legality
of electronic contracts. The idea was that Abraham's measure would
expire once all states adopted a uniform digital-signature standard
that has been recommended by a national group of lawmakers, state
officials and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill that Abraham tried to bring up for a vote last week
was substantially different from that compromise and included
provisions that would pre-empt a number of state and federal laws.
So Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., blocked its consideration, saying
that Abraham had reneged on a carefully drawn compromise and was
trying to pass off a substitute as the same bill that had been
supported by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation is pending in the House, introduced by Rep.
Thomas Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the House Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The National Conference of State Legislatures issued a statement
last week saying that the Bliley bill ``would eviscerate consumer
protections'' and eliminate record-keeping requirements that allow
state and federal oversight agencies to do their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists on both sides of the argument spent much of last week
working with legislators, trying to help settle the differences in
the House and Senate bills.
</P>
<P>
   Changes made on Friday to the House bill tried to address
consumers' concerns by adding provisions to clarify that state and
federal consumer-notification laws still applied, and that
notification requirements could be made electronically only if the
consumer had consented by using a form separate from the credit or
loan agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The revised House bill would also state that insurance
cancellation notices, home foreclosure and utility-disconnection
warnings would still have to be sent by mail.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer groups and the administration remain staunchly
opposed to both bills, which could go to the floor for votes this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, they've made a lot of changes,'' said Margot Saunders of
the National Consumer Law Center. ``But the problem is not the
examples they have addressed. The problem is the whole game.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Saunders said that exempting foreclosure notices did not get
to the underlying matter of all the warning notices that would
precede that final document _ and which would not come by regular
mail in the case of contracts that had been completed
electronically. ``The big difference between electronic information
and written information is that it costs money and takes extra
effort for consumers to receive electronic information,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Larsen is the chief executive of E-Loan, an online loan
center in California's Silicon Valley that is working with an
industry group, the Electronic Financial Services Council, to get
the legislation passed. He said he was perplexed by the
administration's opposition to the Bliley and Abraham bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly see this as an aggressive pro-consumer issue,''
Larsen said, ``because it allows online disclosure that allows
better disclosure to consumers at a lower cost.''
</P>
<P>
   He said companies were not trying to get around consumer
protection laws, but simply wanted to bring their businesses into
the electronic age.
</P>
<P>
   He said his company had processed some $2.3 billion in loans
online. Enabling more of the transaction to take place
electronically, he said, results in lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not talking about changing any of the disclosures that
are required at the state or federal level,'' Larsen added. ``We
think all those protections are essential to consumers. We just
want to be able to deliver that electronically.''

CITIZENS IN CYBERSPACE

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The prospect of voters one day casting ballots on the Internet
makes some people nervous. It shouldn't. People shop on the Net,
bank on the Net, get information about politicians on the Net, and
conduct much of their business in cyberspace _ so why not vote out
there?
</P>
<P>
   Purists wince at what seems like a blow to the civic tradition
of going to the polling place. But on-line voting is being
considered in addition to, not a replacement for, the old-fashioned
ballot. It would be a convenience _ like a ride to the polls or an
absentee ballot _ making voting easier.
</P>
<P>
   Tests this week in Iowa and earlier this year in the state of
Washington indicate that voter anonymity can be maintained and the
system can be secured against fraud. More testing would have to be
done before people vote from home computers in a national election,
but that innovation is probably inevitable. Chet Culver, Iowa's
secretary of state, figures it will be here in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Culver wanted the trial run in his state to fire up young voters
``intimidated by the current process.'' Only 15 percent of people
age 18 to 24 vote in US elections. The purist who remembers the
1950s junior high civics course might want to boot these young
people into the polls, but speaking their technological language
might work better.
</P>
<P>
   The convenience of voting from home or from computers in
libraries and other public buildings just might inspire all voters,
who have been woefully apathetic _ even in presidential election
years turnout is less than 50 percent. Culver notes that America
ranks 137th for voter participation among the world's 167
democracies.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout drops still lower in off-year elections like the one
held this week, when most of the races involve municipal offices.
In Boston, only 59,563 people, or 24.5 percent of the city's
243,184 registered voters, went to the polls on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Purists worried about the blow the Internet might inflict on
civic tradition should consider the pummeling democracy is taking
from a turned-off electorate. Every tool of the communications age
should be used to restart that vital engine.

WEB SITE FOR CHAPSTICK ADDICTS  
 BRITANNICA, TITANICA  
 RENT A MASTERPIECE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Got the shakes for some lip balm? Try the Chap Stick Addicts
support group on sixdegrees.com.
</P>
<P>
   The group had about 250 active members at last count, and is
adding more every day _ from a high school student who says she
can't concentrate without her balm to another who can't walk into a
dime store without buying a new stick.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of ChapStick as addictive product came as news to the
folks at Whitehall-Robins, the American Home Products unit that
makes ChapStick. ``It's certainly not addictive _ it's a petroleum
product for lips,'' said Carol Dornbush, a spokeswoman for the
company, based in Madison, N.J. ``I guess we have a lot of loyal
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell that, however, to the several dozen people who took
to the site last week to discuss their habit, or any regular at Lip
Balm Anonymous, an unrelated site (www.kevdo.com/lipbalm) whose
stated purpose is to ``stay free from lip balm and to help others
achieve the same freedom.'' The premise of those who see a
potential for addiction is that lip balms eventually dry out the
lips, forcing the user to apply more.
</P>
<P>
   Chap Stick Addicts is only one of 15,000 discussion groups on
sixdegrees.com, an advertising-supported site that states that it
was ``inspired'' by the theory that every person in the world is
connected to every other person through no more than six
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The site appears to have a struck a chord: More than 6,000 new
members sign up every day, each apparently interested in chatting
with people of similar interests. A spokeswoman for the company,
Rebecca Tompkins, partly attributes the popularity of the ChapStick
group to its being featured in the site's theme of the week section
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the sixdegrees site's astounding growth results from an
innovative, though perhaps irritating, process: Anybody who
registers must supply the names and e-mail addresses of three
friends; the company then invites them to become members. Nearly a
third of those people who receive invitations register for the
service. Members can request to meet only those people who are
direct friends of their friends, or just anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Now, pass the ChapStick.

   Revamped Britannica Site Is Swamped by Demand
</P>
<P>
   The maiden voyage of the free Internet-based version of
Encyclopaedia Britannica is shaping up like the Encyclopaedia
Titanica.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 19, Britannica opened a revamped version of its Web
site, Britannica.com, offering free access to the entire contents
of the encyclopedia. Trouble is, the company was unprepared for the
influx of traffic, which promptly caused the site to crash.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two weeks later, the site still is not up, and it is not
expected to be accessible until at least the middle of this week
until the company increases its computer capacity. Instead of
seeing encyclopedia content, site visitors last week were met with
a note from Don Yannias, chief executive of Britannica Inc., which
is based in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were simply unable to handle the demand,'' he wrote, adding
that reaching sufficient capacity ``is a big job but we're
committed to getting there as fast as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, even that letter of explanation was removed, replaced
by a notice that the site was ``Coming Soon.''
</P>
<P>
   How could Britannica be so unprepared, given that it is no Web
novice? The company has been online since 1994 with a fee-based
research service _ $5 a month before the recent remodeling _ and a
licensing program for educational organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In a manner of speaking, Britannica officials blame the
messengers. They said they had vastly underestimated the amount of
media coverage the site's revamping would create. The grand
reopening generated some 850 articles and Internet accounts
worldwide _ including front-page coverage in five of nine daily
newspapers in Britain, said Kent Devereaux, Britannica's senior
vice president for product development.
</P>
<P>
   Devereaux said that international visitors helped contribute to
levels of traffic that were ``orders of magnitude'' higher than the
hundreds of thousands of daily visitors the site was accustomed to.
He said late last week that the company still was not certain how
many visitors it had received and was analyzing the traffic data.

   Fine Art Flexibility
</P>
<P>
   So the corporate digs need spiffing up and you think some
original art sure would be nice over the reception desk, or in the
conference room. True, you could get some by-the-numbers original
oils, or an old master print _ but you want something with a bit
more class.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at today's art prices? Forget it.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Peck has heard that cry, and he plans to start a Web site,
fineartlease.com, that, as its name implies, leases original
artwork.
</P>
<P>
   The good stuff includes the likes of N.C. Wyeth, Chagall,
Hockney. Browse the site's gallery; if a painting grabs your fancy,
it can be had for as little as three months or as much as 10 years
_ at, say, roughly $1,400 a month for a painting valued at $75,000.
</P>
<P>
   In a world where so much is borrowed, why should art be any
different? Think of the tax deduction on those lease payments _
starting at 15 percent of the painting's value a year. Peck cites
the tax benefit as a big selling point.
</P>
<P>
   Browsing can be conducted by genre, period or size, fitting the
art to the room. If the design consultant wants an 18th-century
landscape, punch that in. If a 3-by-4-foot still life is called
for, search away.
</P>
<P>
   While the target market is a corporate clientele, individuals
may also apply. And there is even a lease-to-own option.
</P>
<P>
   Peck, who is 32, began as a junior cataloger at Sotheby's and
went on to run his own gallery. His new company will own some
artwork, but will mostly act as an agent for museums and galleries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Museums in this country,'' he said, ``hang 6 to 8 percent of
their permanent collection, and the rest sits unused. So for them,
it's found money.'' And they'll be insured _ a key part of the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Peck said he had about 50 galleries lined up and was close to
deals with various museums, which he expects to account for about a
third of his art.
</P>
<P>
   With this service, ``corporations can have a lot of flexibility
with their collections,'' he said. ``They can even sell their
collection to us and we can lease it back to them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have several corporations and law firms lined up,'' he
said, adding that law firms ``are very interested in this.''

IN DEFENSE OF MIRANDA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Supreme Court should back President Clinton's call to
protect the Miranda rights of suspects. To some eyes Miranda is an
escape hatch. It seems that police officers who don't say the
Miranda chant _ you have the right to remain silent, to an
attorney, to have an attorney appointed if you can't afford one _
essentially hand criminals a get-out-of-jail-free card.
</P>
<P>
   But this spin ignores a distinguished history. In 1966 the
Supreme Court, in Miranda v. Arizona, pointed to hundreds of years
of American and English case law that have repeatedly endorsed the
right, embodied in the Fifth Amendment, of individuals not to
incriminate themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``To respect the inviolability of the human personality,'' the
Miranda ruling said, ``our accusatory system of criminal justice
demands that the government seeking to punish an individual produce
the evidence against him by its own independent labors rather than
by the cruel, simple expedient of compelling it from his own
mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   But protecting this right takes profound discipline. Ernesto
Miranda, for example, made it tempting for the police to sidestep
the Fifth Amendment. He had been found guilty of kidnapping and
rape. He signed a confession. The Supreme Court ruling described
him as ``seriously disturbed.'' So why not just jail him? Because
in their own testimony, the police said they hadn't advised Miranda
of his rights. And rights, as our courts repeatedly find, always
apply, even to the guilty.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968 Congress passed a law that muddied the issue. It said
confessions were admissible if they were voluntary. This applied
only to federal prosecutors and, tellingly, was never enforced by
the Justice Department. But last February the dusty legal relic was
revived. A federal appeals court in Virginia ruled that the 1968
law had indeed overturned Miranda in federal cases.
</P>
<P>
   It is an outrageous proposition. The Supreme Court should act
quickly on the newly filed Justice Department brief urging that the
1968 law be permanently muted. If society hesitates to declare the
rights of individuals out loud, they stand to lose their awesome
power.

CD SOFTWARE SAID TO GATHER DATA ON USERS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   RealNetworks' popular RealJukebox software for playing CDs on
computers surreptitiously monitors the listening habits and certain
other activities of people who use it and continually reports this
information, along with the user's identity, to RealNetworks, said
a security expert who intercepted and examined data generated by
the program.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews last week, company officials acknowledged that
RealJukebox, which can copy music to a user's hard drive and
download it from the Internet as well as play it, gathers
information on what music users are playing and recording.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Richards, RealNetworks' vice president for consumer
products, said the company gathered the information to customize
services for individual users. He and other company officials
insisted that the practice did not violate consumer privacy because
the information was not being stored by RealNetworks nor
distributed to other companies.
</P>
<P>
   But privacy advocates and security experts interviewed last week
were unanimous in condemning the practice, calling it a violation
of the privacy of the 13.5 million registered users of RealJukebox,
almost all of whom have given the company their names and e-mail
addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the company's use of the data is benign, these experts
said, the practice is unacceptable because of the secrecy:
RealNetworks, one of the largest distributors of audio software on
the Internet, does not inform consumers that they are being
identified and monitored by the company.
</P>
<P>
   The information that RealNetworks gathers is extensive.
According to Richard Smith, an independent Internet security
consultant from Brookline, Mass., who discovered RealJukebox's
monitoring functions, each time the program is started on a
computer connected to the Internet, it sends in the following
information to the company: the number of songs stored on the
user's hard drive; the kind of file formats _ RealAudio or MP3 _
the songs are stored in; the quality level of the recordings; the
user's preferred music genre, and the type of portable music
player, if any, that the user has connected to the computer.
Officials at RealNetworks said most of this information was used to
offer music selections to users based on their preferences.
</P>
<P>
   All this information is combined with a personal serial number
known as a globally unique identifier, or GUID, which is assigned
to each user when he or she registers the software.
</P>
<P>
   RealJukebox is distributed only on the Internet, and users are
instructed to register _ giving the company their names, e-mail
addresses and ZIP codes _ when they install the software.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, if RealJukebox is used with its default settings,
it automatically loads each time a CD is inserted in the CD-ROM
drive, and if the computer is connected to the Internet, the title
of the CD is sent, together with the GUID, to RealNetworks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either they have been dazzlingly careless with their treatment
of personally identifiable information or they are completely
disingenuous,'' said Jason Catlett, founder and president of
Junkbusters, a privacy watchdog organization. ``Which is worse? If
they are not disclosing what they are doing, that is
unconscionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Some other CD player programs also assign GUIDs to each copy of
the software. The difference lies in what they do with it.
Microsoft Corp., for example, says that the unique identifier in
its Windows Media Player is used for such things as purchasing
multimedia from a Web site. It is not routed through Microsoft, nor
does Microsoft require users to register, and it does not gather
information through Media Player, said a spokesman for Waggener
Edstrom, a public relations firm that represents Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that RealJukebox is gathering this information is not
mentioned in the long privacy policy the company posts on its Web
site. Nor is it acknowledged in the licensing agreement that users
must approve when installing the program.
</P>
<P>
   David Banisar, a lawyer in Washington who specializes in
Internet law, said that RealNetworks' surveillance practices could
violate various state and federal statutes, including the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act. ``It's a new type of case that hasn't been
brought before,'' he said. ``But I think it's a pretty good case.''
</P>
<P>
   Banisar argued that RealJukebox could be considered a ``trojan
horse,'' a legitimate program that contains hidden instructions to
perform illegitimate functions.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said on Friday that the registration procedure
for the free version of RealJukebox did ask for personal
information, including name and e-mail address, but they said that
users could skip the registration and still use the program and
that RealJukebox would stop prompting users to register after five
attempts. Some customers, they said, had stumbled on this fact and
had declined to register.
</P>
<P>
   However, customers who purchase RealJukebox Plus, a version with
enhanced features that RealNetworks sells online for $29.99 with a
money-back guarantee, cannot avoid registering since they must type
in a unique serial number to install the program. And in this case,
RealNetworks also gathers credit card and mailing address
information before it assigns the number.
</P>
<P>
   Richards of RealNetworks said the reason the program tallied the
number of songs a user had recorded was to enable the company to
determine whether the user was ``naive'' or ``sophisticated.'' This
better enables the software to steer sophisticated users toward its
advanced features, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But this seemed at odds with a statement by Steve Banfield,
RealNetworks' general manager of consumer products, who said the
company was gathering only ``aggregate usage'' information about
users of the software.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy experts said the kind of information being gathered by
RealJukebox had the potential to be used to detect copyright
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Banfield said that to his knowledge, the company had no plans to
allow information about individual users to be used in this manner.
</P>
<P>
   But Catlett of Junkbusters said that such information could be
subpoenaed under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. ``This usage
and tracking information is a way for them to collect intrusive
profiles about people and possibly set up prosecutions for
copyright infringements,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like some 250 other such programs, RealJukebox licenses the
right to use a database of CD titles and tracks that is compiled
and maintained by a company called CDDB. This enables the software
to display the title and tracks of a CD moments after it is loaded
into the computer. To do this, the program must send out
information to CDDB every time a user plays a CD.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike other popular programs, RealJukebox routes the
information through its own servers and tags it with the GUID,
which uniquely identifies the user.
</P>
<P>
   Banfield said the information went to CDDB via a proxy server, a
computer that masks certain data, to protect the privacy of
RealJukebox users. He said it was his understanding that CDDB
typically collected a user's e-mail addresses each time its
database was queried, but by using a proxy server, he said,
RealNetworks' users were all generically identified as
user(AT)real.com.
</P>
<P>
   Banfield painted RealNetworks as a defender of consumer privacy,
asserting: ``Everyone else who uses that database sends them their
e-mail address. We don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Greenberg, senior vice president of marketing and business
development for CDDB, said last week that her company ``strongly
encourages but does not require'' e-mail addresses or any other
identifiers that enable the company to tally unique users of its
database. She said the addresses were purged every four days. But
she said it was not fair for RealNetworks' to blame CDDB for
gathering personal information.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Roger Guenveur Smith, who is in New York to reprise
his acclaimed theatrical reincarnation of Huey Newton, has delved
into a cornucopia of tics, accents and colloquialisms to play a
startling range of characters. His film roles include a disabled
peddler in Spike Lee's ``Do the Right Thing,'' a jive-talking
hustler in Lee's ``He Got Game'' and a cuckolded husband in ``Eve's
Bayou.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who attended the Yale School of Drama, has said that he
may be the kind of actor who will become an ``overnight'' star
after years of perfecting his craft in roles in which he looks and
sounds quite different.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of these days, the dots will be connected, and I won't be
able to ride the subway anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Huey P. Newton Story,'' Smith's one-man show about the life
of the Black Panther Party co-founder who was shot to death in
Oakland, Calif., in 1989, has traveled the country and become his
signature piece. After his years of playing supporting film roles
and writing and directing for the stage, this could be the vehicle
that helps connect the dots of his varied career. A film version of
the piece is in the works, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Since ``Huey's'' New York debut at the Joseph Papp Public
Theater in 1997, Smith has taken the show to London and Brussels,
Belgium. The two encore performances, Friday and Saturday at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music, are being offered through 651 Arts,
which bills itself as Brooklyn's premier African-American arts
presenter.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 43, said that both the place and the timing were right
for his show. ``In many senses, Brooklyn is a world unto itself.
There are thousands of people in Brooklyn who don't do things
socially and culturally outside the borough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show should have new resonance considering the political
atmosphere of the city at present, with art under attack, with the
Klan marching and police brutality seemingly unchecked.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Smith was alternately funny, engaging and
guarded, declining to answer some questions about his personal life
and even bemoaning that his age would be a part of this article.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great tools of the actor is observation,'' he said
at one point. ``It's difficult to observe while being observed.''
</P>
<P>
   While being photographed in downtown Brooklyn, Smith was
observed, and recognized, by several passers-by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey man, get on the bus,'' one called to Smith, alluding to
his role as a police officer in ``Get on the Bus,'' a film about a
group of men traveling to the Million Man March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked you in `Oz,''' said another fan, referring to the
television series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you, I know you,'' yelled still another.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was approached by dapper lawyers and teen-agers with
portable disc players. Some recited a litany of films; others knew
him only in specific roles. A handful knew his name, but they all
wanted his autograph, a handshake or a chance to chat.
</P>
<P>
   ``People know my face, they don't necessarily know my name,''
Smith said. ``Maybe that's a good thing. They can't scream at me
from across the street.''

GRUESOME `BONE COLLECTOR' PILES ON THE MOVIE CLICHES 
</HEADLINE>
 SLUG-BONE-REVIEW-LADN  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Our rating:  2 stars  
(Eds: Not for use before FRIDAY, NOV. 5) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Slick and sordid, ``The Bone Collector'' comes off as an
unappetizing cross between ``Quincy, M.E.'' and ``Seven.'' There
are a few gruesome thrills for audiences with strong stomachs, but
no amount of surgically removed flesh can disguise the fact that
this movie is nothing more than a shallow and silly exercise in
grisly entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bone Collector'' is another in a long line of serial
killer thrillers, this time featuring a New York City wacko who
likes to murder people in turn-of-the-century locales like
stockyards and slaughterhouses. He leaves behind an assortment of
clues _ old newspaper clippings, manacles, bolts and assorted
powders and substances _ to taunt and tantalize the police.
</P>
<P>
   This attracts the attention of Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel
Washington), a forensics detective with a brilliant mind for crime.
Rendered a quadriplegic by an accident, Lincoln works out of his
bed with the help of a live-in nurse (Queen Latifah) and a
whiz-bang computer that does everything but make his coffee. But
Lincoln needs someone to be his eyes and ears (and arms and legs),
so he enlists an unlikely candidate, a feisty, young policewoman,
Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie), to work the crime scenes.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, based on Jeffery Deaver's novel of the same name, is
as ritualistic as its killer. There's the requisite incompetent
authority figure, a police captain (Michael Rooker) who's so stupid
that he exists only to make Lincoln look good. There's the familiar
push-pull dynamic between Lincoln and Amelia, who clash at first
but eventually reach a deep understanding full of mutual love and
respect.
</P>
<P>
   There are also underlying personal issues: Lincoln fears a
mind-crippling seizure, while Amelia deals with the after-effects
of her father's suicide. Both subjects are given only the most
superficial treatment so as not to take away time from the film's
graphic crime scenes.
</P>
<P>
   All of this would be more tolerable if the movie's third act
went anywhere. But the story, adapted rather incongruously by
Jeremy Iacone, layers on coincidences and contrivances (much like
director Philip Noyce continually pours on the rain) and then
delivers the rather impotent killer completely out of left field.
</P>
<P>
   Top it off with a coda scene that seems to belong in an entirely
different movie, and you've got a film that leaves you with a sick
feeling in your stomach. And it has nothing to do with all the
severed bones and fingers you've had to digest. &QL;

 NEW YORK: the street.''   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps. Still, Smith has been ever more visible in the last 10
years, beginning with his appearance in ``Do the Right Thing,'' the
film about racial tensions in a Brooklyn neighborhood. He played
the stuttering Smiley, an innocent who cries out for reconciliation
and who peddles the only known photograph of Malcolm X and the Rev.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. together.
</P>
<P>
   Smith created the role of Smiley after Spike Lee gave him the
script and told him to come up with something. The two have gone on
to work together in five other films, often improvising characters
and dialogue. Smith's last film with Lee was ``Summer of Sam,'' in
which Smith plays a detective.
</P>
<P>
   His other film roles have included a drug addict in ``Deep
Cover,'' a sinister FBI agent in ``Panther'' and a city councilman
in ``King of New York.'' He also had a recurring role as Professor
Randolph in the NBC series ``A Different World.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who grew up and still lives in Los Angeles, resembles
Newton, who is frozen in some imaginations as a beret-wearing,
gun-toting emblem of black rage and black cool wrapped in a black
leather jacket. Smith also does a superb imitation of Newton's
whiny voice. He talks about how people close to Newton are startled
by how vividly he evokes him. In a 1997 review of the show in The
New York Times, Margo Jefferson wrote that Smith's performance
``pairs superb theatrical artifice with genuinely harrowing
emotional realism.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is culled mostly from Newton's own words. Onstage,
chain smoking and twitching, Smith deploys a wave of rhetoric and
ruminations about violence, race, politics and whatever else came
into Newton's smart, complicated, tortured brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of improvisation,'' Smith said. ``There are
people who come back five, six times. Perhaps they see new shapes,
new colors. Perhaps they hear new sounds.'' Dramatic pause. ``Or
maybe they just don't understand what the hell I was saying the
first time around, so they had to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   His performance pieces ``Frederick Douglass Now'' and
``Christopher Columbus 1992'' play with issues of race, time
travel, identity and history. Think of Columbus as a black man in
the streets of Los Angeles during the 1992 violence. Think of
Frederick Douglass as a black everyman, rapping about oppression.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his other work, like ``Inside the Creole Mafia'' and
``Radio Mambo: Culture Clash Invades Miami,'' explores themes of
racial identity and culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't grasp ideas and manipulate them, someone else will
do it for us,'' said Smith, who was pursuing a doctorate in
American studies at Yale when he auditioned for the Drama School on
a whim.
</P>
<P>
   His interest in history and race can be seen in his current
projects. He is developing an ensemble play called ``Iceland''
about a former military strongman from the West Indies who is in
exile in Iceland, and a theater piece called ``Blood and Brains''
about a fugitive slave who escapes into another century.
</P>
<P>
   He is also working on a film script called ``Incog-negroes,''
which he describes as a ``rather autobiographical'' look at reggae
culture as seen by a group of college chums after Bob Marley's
death.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he believed that too many people are insensitive to
human suffering and that passion of any kind is distilled into the
latest consumer product. ``The culture has in a sense doubled back
on itself,'' he said. ``What was once a statement of radical
solidarity or political passion comes back as a statement of
fashion, without the political punch.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his own mix of art and politics, his resume shows that he
has worked almost exclusively with black film directors _ John
Singleton, Kasi Lemmons and others. They have helped him work
around a Hollywood system that many critics contend has failed to
present a range of black characters with interior lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we see mainstream work and a black actor enters, he is
the representative black guy,'' Smith said. ``It's so absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   He especially does not want his Newton show to be particularized
that way, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tendency to see the piece as sociology, as
historical pageantry, specifically as African-American historical
pageantry, a political statement,'' he said. ``It may well be all
of those things. It's also intended as a very simple portrait of a
man in a box.''

`LEPRECHAUNS' IS SHORT ON MAGIC, LONG ON DISAPPOINTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Great news! I have discovered the fountain of youth, and so can
you. Simply watch NBC's simply embarrassing miniseries, ``The
Magical Legend of the Leprechauns,'' and you'll feel like a
7-year-old. Not a happy one, mind you. More like one that's just
had a good talking to. But 7 nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   With an unimaginative four-hour production masquerading as
fantasy extravaganza, NBC is apparently targeting the
impressionable 5-to-9 demographic that hasn't yet witnessed the
``Romeo and Juliet'' edition of ``Riverdance.'' Anyone over 10, on
the other hand, will probably want to sign my petition asking
Robert Halmi Sr. to give it a rest, at least for one sweeps period.
</P>
<P>
   Halmi, whose Hallmark Entertainment evidently exists solely to
perpetuate the networks' programming during ratings sweeps, has had
some winners, notably ``Gulliver's Travels'' and ``Alice in
Wonderland.'' But clunkers like ``Noah's Ark,'' ``Cleopatra'' and
this weekend's ``Leprechauns'' make it clear that Halmi needs to
slow down the assembly line and take a hard look at quality
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leprechauns'' is a disjointed disappointment of a film that
should never have been allowed to sprawl over two nights. Memo to
NBC: Just because Halmi is doing it doesn't mean it's good, or that
it should take up more time than most people have to waste.
</P>
<P>
   The rangy Randy Quaid gets top billing in ``Leprechauns,''
playing Jack Woods, an American businessman in Ireland who's not
being completely honest about why he's there. Falling for a local
lass named Kathleen Fitzpatrick _ what, you expected Zelda
Schwartz? _ lends immediate impact to Jack's duplicity. But even
more troublesome is his relationship with a leprechaun family he's
come to know because he happened to save the life of the adult
male, Seamus Muldoon (Colm Meaney).
</P>
<P>
   There supposedly is no such thing as a female leprechaun, but
Muldoon has a wife, Mary (Zoe Wannamaker), who is described in
publicity material as long-suffering, presumably because she was
forced to watch the entire miniseries.
</P>
<P>
   As Jack's rocky relationship with Kathleen (Orla Brady)
develops, a parallel tale about Ireland's little people unfolds
with its own miniature love story between the Muldoons' son, Mickey
(Daniel Betts), and the fairy princess Jessica (Caroline Carver).
Unfortunately, leprechauns and fairies get along about as famously
as the Montagues and Capulets, so the Mickey/Jessica romance leads
to an all-out war despite the dire warnings of the Grand Banshee
(Whoopi Goldberg), who knows all, sees all and can snuff out the
lives of leprechauns and fairies even though they're supposed to be
immortal.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this taking of life, the Grand Banshee manages to occupy
the moral high ground at all times, issuing admonition but never
advice because, after all, God, er, the Banshee isn't one to sweat
the details.
</P>
<P>
   The run-of-the-mill, phone-it-in performances in ``Leprechauns''
are secondary to the special effects _ some cheesy, some not bad _
for which Halmi's projects have become known. And everything takes
a back seat to the message: peace good, fighting bad, love conquers
all, etc.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``Leprechauns'' message is delivered with a baseball
bat, as if director John Henderson and writer Peter Barnes were
concerned that American audiences might be too dense for subtlety.
Thus, instead of an artistic escapist film described with delicate
brush strokes, they have delivered a Sunday school lesson with no
subtlety at all.
</P>
<P>
   I've got nothing against message films, but I don't like having
the words Louisville Slugger imprinted on my forehead after
watching them.
</P>
<P>
   The Magical Legend of the Leprechauns. Four-hour miniseries
about an American businessman who stumbles upon the fantasy world
of leprechauns and fairies on a visit to Ireland. Starring Randy
Quaid, Orla Brady, Colm Meaney, Zoe Wanamaker, Daniel Betts,
Caroline Carver, Roger Daltrey, Harriet Walter and Whoopi Goldberg.

ALL SOME RETAILERS WANT BEFORE CHRISTMAS IS A WEB SITE THAT WORKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The e-commerce train is about to leave the station for the
second meaningful Internet shopping season, and when it does,
plenty of disappointed retailers will still be standing on the
platform.
</P>
<P>
   Stores like the Limited, Home Depot, Tiffany, Williams-Sonoma's
Pottery Barn, the Sports Authority and Gap's Old Navy are joining a
host of newly formed Internet companies in watching the calendar
move closer to Thanksgiving and the start of the online buying
binge. Some of those retailers are working around the clock to open
their sites within the next two weeks, but others are taking a
``wait till next year'' approach.
</P>
<P>
   There are a variety of reasons that some retailers will miss
this holiday season, analysts and executives say. Established
companies wary of sullying their brands with a weak Web site are
proceeding with extreme caution. Start-ups, on the other hand,
often underestimate the difficulty of building a good site and
miscalculate how long it will take. And everyone is struggling to
find enough programmers, designers, marketers and fulfillment
specialists to get the job done quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this comes down to simply believing that building a
site is an easy thing to do,'' said James McQuivey, an analyst with
Forrester Research. Part of the $10 million cost of building a
first-rate site is hiring people like developers, he said. ``But
guess what _ everybody else is, too,'' he went on. ``Some companies
have been looking for vice presidents of e-commerce all year. Then
you have to build the site, handle fulfillment, customer service
call centers, and on it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Rubin, an e-commerce consultant and chairwoman of
Shop.org, an industry trade group, said companies that handle
fulfillment and other tasks for Internet retailers ``are to this
day getting calls from people looking to get up before Christmas.''
Most of those calls are coming from those with no previous
e-commerce experience, she said. ``The ones with experience know
some of the steps,'' she added, ``and they typically started
planning their launch in the early spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Which makes it all the more puzzling that many deep-pocketed,
experienced retailers that witnessed the e-commerce surge last year
will not make it online this year.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jon Ricker, chief information officer of the
Limited, the company started planning the online rollout of its
brands _ including the Limited, Limited Express and Victoria's
Secret _ in mid-1997. So far, only Victoria's Secret is up and
running; neither the Limited nor Limited Express will have an
e-commerce site running this year. ``We refuse to do damage to our
brand,'' Ricker said. ``The lure of additional Christmas revenue
just isn't worth the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it is easy to say that traditional retailers are lagging
behind because they are not yet able to operate at Internet speed,
Ricker said bigger retailers had more at stake than Internet
start-ups and were justifiably more cautious about risking their
reputations with a site that may not be ready for prime time. ``And
for a large retailer like ourselves with a global presence and
global sourcing,'' he said, ``there's a lot more to consider as you
put the model together.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, larger retail corporations with a single e-commerce
division can do justice to one brand's debut on the Web at a time,
said Shelley Nandkeolyar, vice president for e-commerce at
Williams-Sonoma. The company will introduce its site for
Williams-Sonoma (www.williams-sonoma.com) Monday, as scheduled,
Nandkeolyar said, but other company chains like Pottery Barn and,
appropriately enough, Hold Everything, will have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some hard negotiations between the brands about who
would launch when, but it made most sense to do it this way,''
Nandkeolyar said. The company started the Williams-Sonoma Wedding
and Gift Registry (www.wswedding.com) earlier this year ``to help
us learn about how to launch e-commerce,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the Williams-Sonoma site is going up, and in short order
next year we'll bring the rest online,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If executives like Ricker and Nandkeolyar sound less than
mortified at the prospect of leaving some of their brands on the
e-commerce shelf this year, they may have good reason, analysts
said. Despite the Web retail hyperbole, holiday sales this year
will amount to only $4 billion, according to Forrester Research.
``So I don't think the opportunity cost is huge,'' McQuivey of
Forrester said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But can you live without the confidence it inspires in Wall
Street, or in the boardroom, or the cachet it generates with
consumers who see you on the Web?'' McQuivey asked. ``I think the
opportunity costs are more intangible.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, retailers that miss the rush will also have to work
harder in the future to win customers away from stores that make
the holiday deadline and perform well. Mindful of this, executives
like Dick Sabot, chairman of Eziba.com (www.eziba.com), are
determined not to let November pass without getting started.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which will sell handmade goods from around the
world, is expected to go live within the next week _ thanks in part
to an unexpected source of pressure. ``We had to decide in August
on advertising placement,'' Sabot said, noting that recent ads in
magazines essentially committed the site to rolling out soon. ``If
it wasn't for the discipline that imposed on us, it's hard to
imagine how we would've forced ourselves to get it done. Looking
back, it was a fairly audacious thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Another crucial factor in making the opening happen on time was
persuading e-commerce service providers to work with them. It was
no easy task, since fulfillment and Web site development companies
and advertising agencies were buried with work offers even in
March, when Eziba started building its site. ``We had to go in
there early and win the competition,'' Sabot said. ``And then we
had to convince them to internalize our deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   Nandkeolyar of Williams-Sonoma said he had to guard against
``scope creep'' in the seven months it took to build the
Williams-Sonoma site. Six weeks ago, for instance, one member of
the site development team suggested building more content into a
section devoted to seasonal event planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we could do more, but it would require pages and
pages of programming, and that would jeopardize the launch date,''
he said. ``We couldn't get enough production, since we're in the
Bay Area and everyone's trying to launch by Nov. 1. So we'll just
have to build it out over time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those that have managed to start operating on time are
often doing so quietly, in hopes of ironing out any wrinkles in the
system before the holiday deluge hits. Jim Finkelstein, president
of Luxuryfinder.com (www.luxuryfinder.com), a purveyor of the
pricey that went live late last month after eight months in
development, said he simply did not publicize the rollout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're prepared for the rush, but we just want to make sure
we've got everything right,'' Finkelstein said. ``That's why you
try to get up a couple of months before the holidays. And that's
why it's smart for companies who couldn't launch by the fall to
wait until next year. If you want to create something that will
last, you have to go about it the right way.''

HACKER DEFACE U.S. AIR FORCE WEB SITE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIG CHRISTENSON   
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The Internet site at Lackland Air Force Base in
San Antonio was defaced last weekend by a group of Pakistani-based
hackers whose members vow to target U.S. government and military
Web sites in a bid to win independence for Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistan Hackerz Club's founder, identifying himself as
``Doctor Nuker,'' said in an exchange of e-mail messages with the
San Antonio Express-News that his group also had hacked into the
Internet site at Ingleside Naval Base near Corpus Christi, Texas,
along with 11 others as it battles on behalf of Kashmir, a
territory between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   By one estimate, the group has struck some 85 sites since it
first began its hacking spree, hitting a variety of civilian and
military in numerous nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will deface more government and military sites,'' he
warned.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force said the Lackland attack occurred Friday. The
Ingleside attack took place Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistan Hackerz Club, said by one local expert to be the
most prolific of 50 individual and group ``Web defacers''
worldwide, left its initials, PHC, in yellow over both Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   A rambling diatribe against Indian ``repression'' in Kashmir
followed on the Lackland Web page, with a similar message appearing
on the Ingleside site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The champions of human rights, who were propelled into action
because of ethnic cleansing of the Kosovars, have chosen to
disregard the even more serious repression in Kashmir,'' Doctor
Nuker wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Lackland site, used to provide public information about the
installation, its commanders and activities, was taken offline,
said Lt. Denise Kerr, a base spokeswoman. It was back online
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The group defaced yet another site run by the Energy Department
in Albuquerque, N.M., on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The intrusion into the Energy Department's operation's office
took place sometime after 6 p.m. The department initially appeared
unaware of the attack, but by 6:35 p.m. was reinstalling the Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the online equivalent of spray-paint tagging,'' said
David McGroty, a programmer and Web master with Sahara Digital, an
Alamo City firm that tests computer systems' vulnerability to
hackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of finding that virtual underpass and
spraying your message there so as many people as possible can see
it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokeswoman Debra Weierman said she had no information on
the recent hacking incidents at the San Antonio and Ingleside
military Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   She said FBI and Justice Department policy forbids discussing
any ongoing investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But computer hacking and network intrusion, a federal crime, has
sharply increased. Michael Vatis, director of the FBI's National
Infrastructure Protection Center, last month told a Senate panel
that his agency's caseload has doubled in each of the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, he told the Senate Judiciary Committee, has more than
800 pending investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Malicious and intentional hacking that causes more than $5,000
damage is punishable by a maximum of five years in federal prison,
Justice Department spokesman John Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   Those involved in accidental intrusions which leave no damage
can be jailed for up to six months, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hackers also can be charged with violating federal wiretap laws,
a crime with a 10-year prison term.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre said in February that the
Pentagon is detecting 80 to 100 potential hacking events daily.
</P>
<P>
   Hacking, though, plagues a host of other countries and regions
as well, particularly Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent commentary headlined ``Nerd World War,'' the
Economist magazine cited a report indicating 72,000 ``cyberspace
attacks'' were launched from China against Taiwan in August.
Taiwanese hackers struck back, cracking Web sites operated by the
Chinese tax and railway agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, such high-profile organizations as the Johnson
Space Center in Houston, ABC, the Drudge Report and George Magazine
were attacked by two groups, hackingforgirliez and
unitedloangunmen.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on George Magazine came Oct. 26, a few months after
the death of its founder, John F. Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The message, ``Remember me for I was murdered,'' contained the
date of Kennedy's death with another message, ``Unitedloangunmen
points the finger at the Bush administration of the Illuminati and
Committee of 300.''
</P>
<P>
   The word ``murdered'' turns crimson when a computer mouse
crosses it, and leads to a link containing theories about the plane
crash that claimed the lives of Kennedy, his wife and a
sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   While it's hard to know what the message is, or if the message
is a joke, that isn't the case with Pakistan Hackerz Club, said
McGroty, who noted the group puts a new missive on each web site it
hacks _ some including photos of apparently dead and injured
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``They obviously have a real cause to support,'' he said.

MORE STATIONS BACK REVISED DTV STANDARD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Almost half of the nation's 1,600 television
stations have now expressed support for the Sinclair Broadcast
Group's campaign to revise the nation's standard for digital
television broadcasts. Among the supporters are 350 public
television stations.
</P>
<P>
   Early in October, Sinclair, which owns more television stations
than any other company, filed a petition with the Federal
Communications Commission, arguing that the nation's digital
television standard was seriously flawed because receivers could
not easily pick up a watchable television signal in anything short
of ideal circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of that filing, almost 300 television stations had
joined Sinclair. Now, the company announced late last week, the
number has grown to more than 750. Many have signed Sinclair's
petition, some have filed similar petitions of their own and others
have expressed support without taking any action.
</P>
<P>
   Sinclair officials said they were gratified by the additional
support and expected to gain more. The company's petition asks the
FCC to revise the digital broadcasting standard, approved three
years ago, by adding a second transmission standard that is now
used in Europe. Tests run by Sinclair last summer showed that it
worked better in some circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Television stations would be able to choose which transmission
standard they would use, and television receivers would be equipped
to receive either. The digital receivers already sold would not
work with the new standard, though it is possible that owners could
buy an add-on box that would enable them to receive the new
transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC has not said what it may do with the Sinclair petition.
But the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association, speaking
for the industries that oppose the petition, filed a motion to
dismiss it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reopening the proceeding on a DTV standard years after its
adoption by the commission will benefit no one but the handful of
broadcasters desiring to delay the transition to digital
broadcasting,'' the motion said.

AT&AMP;T FIGHTS PUSH TO OPEN CABLE LINES TO ITS RIVALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Seeking to stamp out a growing political brush
fire that started here, the AT&AMP;T Corp. argued before a federal
appeals court Monday that the city exceeded its authority last year
when it sought to force AT&AMP;T to open its cable lines to rival
Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has bought some of the nation's biggest cable companies in
the last year in a bid to become the leading provider of service
over cable lines, offering not only television programming but
ultimately high-speed Internet connections and local telephone
service. Cable can provide Internet access 10 to 80 times as fast
as a standard telephone line, allowing customers to retrieve
information from the World Wide Web with the immediacy they get
when changing television channels.
</P>
<P>
   But in a case being watched closely around the country and
argued Monday before a three-judge panel of the United States Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Portland and Multnomah County
have essentially taken the position that high-speed Internet
service over cable lines should be opened to competition, much the
way long-distance telephone lines were after decades of control by
AT&AMP;T. Under Portland's plan, these competitors, like America
Online, would pay AT&AMP;T a fee for use of the cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge here has already ruled in Portland's favor, and
a handful of local authorities around the country have followed its
lead in providing for ``open access,'' a position that AT&AMP;T
portrays as an outrageous undermining of its multibillion-dollar
investment to upgrade cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual vote on Tuesday, Denver residents are being asked
whether to extend the city's franchise agreement with AT&AMP;T, with
the company's critics urging a vote of no to force the open-access
issue onto th there.
</P>
<P>
   But in other places where the issue has come up, including Los
Angeles and Seattle, officials have refrained from imposing access
requirements, not wishing to jeopardize the introduction of
advanced cable services and calling instead for some clarification
at the federal level.
</P>
<P>
   In a line of reasoning Monday that seemed to take both sides in
the Portland case by surprise, the judicial panel questioned
whether the lines were a cable service at all anymore, but instead
a telecommunications service that should presumably be regulated
federally.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we decide that this is a telecommunications service or
facility, either one, this case is over, is it not?'' Edward Leavy,
an appeals court judge on the panel, which also includes Judges
Ferdinand F. Fernandez and Sidney R. Thomas, asked lawyers at the
packed hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But that possibility left both sides predicting victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's what they decide, that's terrific and we would love
to see that as national policy,'' said Erik Sten, the commissioner
here who oversees cable issues. Sten predicted that under federal
oversight, open access would be required. ``This has to be used for
the public good,'' he said at a news conference Monday, ``and the
public good is choice.''
</P>
<P>
   But David W. Carpenter, a lawyer for AT&AMP;T, told the judges that
Congress had already passed telecommunications laws allowing for
vigorous competition over Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress was clear,'' Carpenter told the judges, ``because it
wanted nothing _ nothing _ to get in the way of that conversion''
of cable lines for Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Federal Communications Commission has sided with
AT&AMP;T, filing a brief in the Portland case saying that any
regulation of high-speed Internet service was premature, and in any
case was a federal matter, not a local one.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court, which is expected to rule early in the new
year, is being asked to decide whether Judge Owen M. Panner of
United States District Court backed Portland's actions by ruling in
June that AT&AMP;T had ``no contractual right under the franchise
agreements to exclude competitors from the cable modem platform.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T bought several huge companies, including TCI, which had
been providing service here. Portland used the normally routine
matter of a formal franchise transfer to AT&AMP;T as a means of
imposing the open-access requirement.
</P>
<P>
   The Open Net Coalition, made up of a range of AT&AMP;T rivals
including America Online and GTE, backs open-access requirements
but also says it wants to sit down with AT&AMP;T and hammer out a fair
price agreement for access to customers over the cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members are standing here holding out money and telling
AT&AMP;T, `Here, take our money,''' said Gregory Simon, a former top
aide to Vice President Gore, who is co-director of the coalition
with Richard Bond, a former chairman of the Republican National
Committee. ``The only thing stopping AT&AMP;T from taking our money is
AT&AMP;T.''
</P>
<P>
   But AT&AMP;T, which provides high-speed Internet access through an
exclusive agreement with the Excite(at)Home service, in which it
owns a major stake, says there is no rationale for forcing the
company to open up the lines it has paid for and improved. Monday
it made public a letter signed by more than 100 high-technology
companies warning that such requirements could stifle Internet
innovation.

AWAITING VERDICT, MICROSOFT STARTS LOBBYING CAMPAIGN

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first part of the verdict in the Microsoft
trial is due out soon, perhaps as soon as Friday. But the Microsoft
Corp. is already looking past the legal case and lobbying the
government to pass laws that would protect the company in areas
where it is being challenged in court.
</P>
<P>
   When the company distributed its annual report in September, two
million shareholders also got a letter from Robert Herbold,
Microsoft's chief operating officer, urging them to join a lobbying
effort to protect what the company calls its ``freedom to
innovate.''
</P>
<P>
   Loosely translated, that catch phrase means freedom to design
products however the company chooses _ including the freedom to
bundle other products, like a Web browser, with the Windows
operating system. The decision to build a Web browser into Windows
is a central element of the government's antitrust case against
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Herbold's letter directs shareholders to the company's ``freedom
to innovate'' Web site, where visitors are informed that the
``freedom to innovate network was formed as a response to the
overwhelming amount of correspondence'' the company had received
``regarding the trial with the Justice Department and other public
policy issues.''
</P>
<P>
   With the court's findings of facts imminent, both sides in the
trial are scurrying to anticipate and manage the public relations
fallout. But Microsoft sees its lobbying effort as a long-term
political strategy that will be followed whatever the outcome of
the case.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokesman said the site was set up earlier this year
``as just a way to channel the thousands of people who wrote to us
about the trial.'' The spokesman added that Microsoft's leadership
had decided to send the letter to shareholders after the trial was
essentially over because the company now viewed ``freedom to
innovate'' as a broader term covering other political issues of
interest to the company, like government policies dealing with
encryption, software piracy and Internet taxation.
</P>
<P>
   But the Web site does not reflect a change of thinking in any
prominent way. The opening page complains about the trial,
including a quotation from an unnamed Web-site visitor, printed in
red italic letters, that says: ``The actions of the government
against the Microsoft Corporation are detrimental to the very
system of competition that made the U.S. a world leader in
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   In an upper corner is a link to a page that lists the company's
additional concerns. (Even there, the second item reiterates the
``freedom to innovate'' theme, saying: ``The government should
continue to exercise great restraint in regulating this industry,
which has brought such remarkable advances to consumers and
benefits to the economy.'')
</P>
<P>
   But a more prominent link on the home page, labeled ``Contact
Congress,'' directs people to a page with the heading: ``Tell your
Congressional representatives and state officials where you stand
on the Department of Justice's antitrust lawsuit against
Microsoft.'' There is no mention of piracy, encryption or any other
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Moving on from there, visitors are presented with an interactive
menu that allows them to send e-mail entreaties directly to members
of Congress and to their state legislators. (Nineteen states joined
the federal government's antitrust suit.)
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of people have visited the Web page, the
Microsoft spokesman said, and more than 100,000 have used it to
send messages to Congress or to the company, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He asserted that Microsoft had every right to lobby Congress on
issues related to the trial because ``a lot of people are
dissatisfied with the case, and there are policy implications that
come out of the case, and Congress has oversight responsibility for
the Department of Justice, right?''
</P>
<P>
   A senior congressional aide who is generally aware of lobbying
by Microsoft said the ``freedom to innovate'' campaign did not
appear to be generating a focused, coherent message. In fact, the
Web site does not offer suggested language for visitors sending
e-mails, as many similar lobbying campaigns do.
</P>
<P>
   But the spokesman said Microsoft was not promoting a specific
legislative proposal, adding: ``This really has nothing to do with
the trial; it's totally policy focused. The trial is going along on
a separate track.''
</P>
<P>
   On that track, the presiding judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, has
announced that he will issue his findings of fact in the case on a
coming Friday evening. Findings of fact are half of the judge's
reasoning that make up a verdict. They are a statement of what he
has concluded from the conflicting factual arguments the two sides
have presented in court.
</P>
<P>
   The finding might, as a hypothetical example, say that the judge
does not accept Microsoft's reasoning for tying the Web browser to
Windows. This would be a clear indication that he intends to find
against Microsoft on that charge. But a second element of the
ruling will come later. It will comprise conclusions of law, the
legal arguments and precedents justifying a conclusion. Both are
required for a sustainable verdict.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Already, the company and its opponents are offering different
takes on the significance of the findings of fact.
</P>
<P>
   A group of lawyers who oppose Microsoft, working under the
umbrella of the Computer and Communications Industry Association,
held a telephone news conference on Thursday and generally
proclaimed that the public should be able to see whether the judge
intends to finds Microsoft guilty by reading his findings of fact.
That will be the case, ``despite Microsoft's efforts to distract
the analysis from the real issues in court,'' said Donald Falk, an
antitrust lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   But a Microsoft lawyer had a different perspective in an
interview late last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a step toward a decision,'' he said. ``I think
there may be a lot things in the findings that are legally
irrelevant.''

ONLINE COMPANIES USING TV ADS TO SPUR HOLIDAY SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.
Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling (888)
603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.) 
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Send.com is buying its 15 minutes of fame right now.
</P>
<P>
   The year-old Internet gift site has raised only $10 million in
venture capital funding so far, but it has committed to spend $20
million for television advertising on such top-rated shows as Ally
McBeal, Frasier and Monday Night Football in the next eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Its budget would be substantial for even a big retailer like
Amazon.com, which is said to have spent $17 million on television
for all of 1998. But for tiny send.com, which has negligible
revenue and no profits, it is stunningly audacious.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has borrowed against investors' pledges of more
capital to pay for his ad spending spree, Send.com chief executive
Michael Lannon sees little choice. ``Not every company is going to
survive this Christmas,'' he said. ``We are treating the next eight
weeks like an election campaign. Both we and our investors believe
that customers are going to vote on who the leading gift site is,
and only one candidate wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that this holiday season will be make-or-break,
e-retailers are burning through resources as they race one another
to bring their names to consumers through TV advertising.
</P>
<P>
   There is little evidence that such exposure in a crowded market
will prove to be a cost-efficient way to attract new customers. In
fact, Amazon.com recently said it would triple holiday ad spending,
a move that gave stock analysts pause and sent its stock price
plunging. Moreover, in some cases, the start-ups are buying air
time at the expense of other important components, such as customer
service, inventory and simple Web design.
</P>
<P>
   But many companies say they feel compelled to spend everything
they have (and more) and hope the financial markets will refill
their coffers after the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   In all of 1998, Internet companies _ including portals and
online brokerage firms, as well as e-retailers _ accounted for $323
million in TV ad spending, according to Competitive Media
Reporting, an advertising monitoring service. In the first half of
this year, they spent about $400 million on TV, and media buyers
estimate that spending in the second half will far surpass that and
push the sum for the year well past the $1 billion mark.
</P>
<P>
   Though retailers and other gift sites are leading the charge,
almost every site is desperate to register with consumers in the
end-of-year buying crush. Total Internet sales of products and
services like travel are expected to be $6 billion in November and
December, according to Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of e-tailers have sold their souls to the TV networks,
gambling that they can drive massive customers through the site
through mass advertising,'' said David Cowan, a partner in Bessemer
Venture Capital, a Silicon Valley firm that has helped finance such
Web start-ups as Etoys and Mothernature.com. ``This season will be
a proving ground for the TV networks to flex their muscles as the
true portals of e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   As more Internet companies feel the need to match their
competitors' presence on television, the higher the cost of being a
noticeable player in the TV market will be. ``The price of entry
for an annual plan might be $40 to $50 million a year _ $8 to $10
million a quarter,'' said David Smith, the principal in Mediasmith
Inc., a San Francisco agency that plans and buys ad time for
Interactive firms. ``That is a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   To put that in perspective, an established retailer typically
spends 3 percent to 4 percent of its revenue on advertising,
according to Burt Flickinger III, managing partner of Reach
Marketing, a consulting group in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Gap Inc., one of the United States' largest retailers, with $9
billion in expected 1999 revenue, allotted $157 million for
television advertising last year, reports Competitive Media. And
Gap is ubiquitous on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Nordstrom Inc., the department-store chain with more than $5
billion in revenue last year, has just announced its biggest
national TV and print campaign ever. The $17 million effort will
promote _ what else? _ Nordstromshoes.com, its newest Internet
retailing site.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the feeding frenzy has been a boon to the Old Media
concerns that e-companies tend to mock as dinosaurs. Newspapers,
magazines and radio stations have all seen a generous flood of
media dollars. But TV outlets, with their relatively high rates,
have been swimming in Internet funds.
</P>
<P>
   At the major networks, fees for 30-second ads on top programs
like E.R. and Monday Night Football cost a substantial premium over
last year. For 30-second spots on the Super Bowl, average prices
rocketed from $1.6 million on Fox TV last January to $2 million for
ABC's broadcast in January 2000, partly on the strength of Internet
demand.
</P>
<P>
   CBS Inc. has been trading on the desperation of Internet
companies by offering television time in exchange for stock in
those ventures. ``We've been swapping equity for branding,'' said
company spokesman Gil Schwartz, who said the network now has stakes
in 13 companies. Four of the companies, including CBS marketwatch
and cbsmedscape.com, are public, and CBS' stake in those firms is
worth more than half a billion dollars, Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   The obsession with television is a new and unproven strategy
among Internet companies. Even a year ago, most Internet companies
concentrated their ad dollars online. ``Last Christmas, merchants
were allocating 70 to 80 percent of their marketing budgets online
largely at portals,'' said Ken Cassar, a digital commerce analyst
at Jupiter Communications, a new media consulting firm. ``Today,
that is flipped, with the majority being spent on traditional media
and most in television.''
</P>
<P>
   Several factors have led to the transformation of marketing
across the industry. There is a general belief that online
advertising through banners and portals like Yahoo! and America
Online is ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   This past year, Internet companies have enlisted executives from
marketing giants like Pepsi and Procter &AMP; Gamble, which have a
history of using television to increase customer awareness of their
branded products. But most important, television in particular is
perceived as a king maker based on a few Cinderella stories last
year.
</P>
<P>
   In its first year in business, Etoys, a Web-based toy seller,
did $2 million in sales. Then the credit-card consortium Visa
decided that a good way to support e-commerce in general during the
Christmas season was to air an ad for the retailer showing children
snuggled in bed as parents clicked away to get their presents.
Etoys' revenue jumped to $23 million in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Last year there was relatively little ``dot com'' advertising.
Now the ads flow together one after another through the commercial
breaks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Robert Levitan says getting a brand out to consumers is much
tougher now than when he co-founded iVillage, a community site
established in 1995. Now he is chief executive of Flooz.com, which
essentially allows shoppers to buy a gift certificate that can be
redeemed at select Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which was relaunched this fall, calls its currency
flooz and e-mails it to customers. ``Earlier on, if you made a big
noise and were provocative, that was enough,'' he said. ``Now
everyone is provocative and irreverent.''
</P>
<P>
   To rise above the din, Levitan is betting roughly half the
company's $16 million in funding on marketing in the next 10 weeks.
He also gave up a significant share of stock options (he won't say
how many) to actress and comedian Whoopi Goldberg to engage her as
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Also adding to the uncertainty, many young Internet companies
are beginning their TV ads in a big national push without testing
them in smaller markets. Send.com, for example, had done only radio
commercials before it jumped into the national television market.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, industry consultants suspect that some Internet
retailers are shortchanging key operations, like improved Web
design that will keep shoppers coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several times, companies have called up and said basically:
`We have this ad campaign planned. It is $20 million. We have
already shot the commercial and booked the air time. It is running
in three weeks. But we have discovered our Web site is no good.
What should we do?''' said Jakob Nielsen, a Web designer in Silicon
Valley. ``The answer is, you are sort of doomed,'' Nielsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if everything runs smoothly _ if customers arrive and they
find good service _ some Wall Street analysts are beginning to
question whether such big expenditures can be a cost-effective way
to attract new customers.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Amazon.com indicated that it would spend well
over $100 million this holiday season to keep up with the Joneses _
news that meant its cost of acquiring new customers was going up
for the near future and sent its stock price plunging.
</P>
<P>
   But if Wall Street is signaling that it is worried about costs,
e-tailers are turning a deaf ear. Peter Neupert, chief executive of
Drugstore.com, an online pharmacy that has spent heavily on ads,
estimates that it cost his site $63 in the third quarter to acquire
each new customer. ``We expect that number to go up _ not down,'''
he said.

MOTOROLA TO OFFER CHIP THAT SUPPORTS MANY CELL-PHONE STANDARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With an eye toward the convergence of the
Internet and next-generation digital cellular networks, Motorola
plans to announce a new chip design on Monday that is meant to
support a wide range of cellular telephone standards while offering
more computer-like features.
</P>
<P>
   The new chip family is part of Motorola's effort to move its
chip production beyond supplying the company's own cell-phone
business and toward competing directly in the cellular market with
chip makers like Texas Instruments, Royal Philips Electronics and
Qualcomm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been extremely quiet. Now we want people to know we're
open for business,'' said Mario Rivas, the general manager of
Motorola's wireless subscriber systems group.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 225 million cellular telephones will be sold
worldwide, accounting for the sale of $10.7 billion worth of
semiconductors, according to researchers at International Data
Corp., a market research firm in Mountain View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1999 the market has already begun to shift toward data
and Internet-related features. Earlier this year, for example,
Sprint Corp. began offering a variety of phones, made from a
variety of components, that enable Sprint subscribers to perform
rudimentary types of Web surfing. By next year, according to the
market research firm Jupiter Communications, almost half of all
wireless phones sold will have built-in Web-browsing capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The new Motorola system, which will be known as the DSP56690
baseband processor, will come with both a microprocessor and a
specialized digital signal processor capable of handling a variety
of cellular telephone technical formats. Unlike Japan and Europe,
which mainly have single cellular telephone standards, the United
States remains a hodgepodge of competing cellular formats.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola said its new chips would make it possible for a
telephone designer to build a single device capable of working with
a variety of cell phone standards. But the company said it expected
the new processor's ``universal'' architecture to enable a
manufacturer to use the same basic design for a variety of phone
models that would each be intended for use with a specific
transmission format.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average consumer really doesn't travel that much,'' Rivas
said. ``He just wants his phone to work transparently.''
</P>
<P>
   Motorola's biggest challenge in its new strategy is finding a
way to sell its chips to companies with which it competes as a
maker of cellular handsets.
</P>
<P>
   The new chips, which will be available in volume in the first
quarter of next year, have a variety of data-oriented features,
including the ability to run Web browsers and the Java programming
language widely used on the World Wide Web, as well as allowing for
connections to display screens and the USB serial ports by which a
variety of devices can be connected to personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Japan and Europe are now advancing rapidly toward deployment of
so-called 2.5 G wireless data networks that will handle both data
and voice, but not full multimedia. The United States is farther
behind, but high-speed wireless data networks with bandwidth up to
approximately 150 kilobits will begin to become available late next
year in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this is going to be driven by the Internet,'' said
Allen Leibovitch, program manager for semiconductor research at
International Data.
</P>
<P>
   The new Motorola chip is also designed to work with the Global
Positioning Satellite receiver chips that the Federal
Communications Commission is requiring as part of future wireless
emergency 911 service.
</P>
<P>
   But cellular phone carriers are eager to develop new commercial
``location-based'' services as well. In the future, Web sites are
expected to be able to automatically tailor information to a
cellular data phone user, based on where the telephone is.

ONLINE JOB HUNTERS ALTER THE ART OF WRITING A RESUME
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchase by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888)
346-9867.) 
 By DAVID LEONHARDT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a tenet of the job search, passed down to college
graduates for decades: Keep your resume short, ideally no more than
one page. A single sheet is more likely to hold an employer's
attention and make an applicant look organized, not arrogant.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the Internet is doing to one-page resumes what it
has done to personal letters and travel agents. It is making them
less relevant and perhaps even endangering their survival.
</P>
<P>
   White space, brevity and verbs are out. Nouns and comprehensive
descriptions _ including obscure proper nouns, like the names of
computer programs _ are in. If the resume continues page after
page, or screen after screen, so be it. Even Headhunter.net, which
has stricter rules than other Web sites, allows job seekers up to
6,000 characters, about three times the number in a typical
one-page resume.
</P>
<P>
   Computer databases that screen job seekers are the culprit. With
millions of applications sent by e-mail and the Web, employers lack
the time to even glance at many. Instead, they sort through
job-search Web sites like CareerMosaic or through their own virtual
piles by asking computers to search for phrases in the resumes like
``product manager'' and ``Microsoft Excel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a major change,'' said John A. Challenger, chief
executive of Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas Inc., the Chicago firm
that advises about 2,500 job searchers a year. ``The more you can
provide a company, in a way that makes sense, the better chance you
have of being sorted out.''
</P>
<P>
   This movement of job hunters to the Internet is remaking one of
the workplace's most enduring fixtures. ``Resumes have been the
same for 100 years,'' said Jeff Taylor, the chief executive and
founder of Monster.com, an Internet job site with 2 million
resumes.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor recently retrieved resumes from decades past at
universities around Boston and hung 30 of them on a wall in his
Maynard, Mass., headquarters. ``From five feet away, it was very
difficult to delineate which was a 1922 resume and which was a 1998
resume,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A printout of the typical online resume, however, would be
instantly recognizable from five feet because it might go on for
four or five printed pages. Examined up close, it would show other
contrasts. It would include long lists of accomplishments and
skills, not necessarily written in full sentences. It would feature
links to Web sites where employers could find more information. It
might even have a section called ``keywords'' that unabashedly
plays to the computer, seeking to pop up in as many employer
searches as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have tried to eliminate the traditional resume
altogether. Cisco Systems Inc., the computer equipment maker based
in San Jose, Calif., says it must choose among about 25,000 resumes
that pour in each month to fill 750 jobs _ except that many of the
documents are not true resumes. They are ``profiles,'' entered in
data fields the company has set up on its Web site under the
heading, ``Because the best resume is no resume.'' The standardized
format eliminates many worries, like what typeface or kind of paper
to use for a resume, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   The one-page paper resume is hardly on the brink of extinction,
of course. Many job seekers now keep two versions on file: one for
the Web, the other for actual interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Still, online resumes seem to be the wave of the future. And
writing them does require linguistic skills, if of a new variety.
In his resume, Enrique Ramirez, a 1998 graduate of Oberlin College,
changed ``ran experiments'' to ``researched'' with the computer in
mind. ``You have to word it just right,'' said Ramirez, 24, who
landed a job with a health care company near Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Richard J. Carnoske, a software consultant in Tulsa,
Okla., searches the Web to see how employers write job listings.
When appropriate, he then uses their terms _ like ``e-commerce,''
which he added six months ago _ in his resume.
</P>
<P>
   The new science of wording means that verbs, for years seen as
the hallmark of a good resume, can be less useful than nouns
because recruiters more often search for nouns. Some job searchers
even ponder the form of the nouns they are using, said Ben
Bellimson, a senior vice president at CareerPath.com.
``Management,'' for example, can be dangerous because it would be
missed by a recruiter who typed in ``manager.'' Job seekers who
know about databases put down both words.
</P>
<P>
   Internet job hunting can bring on its own headaches. Bullet
points and boldface, often lost in the translation between software
programs, can produce garbled text. So plain text is becoming more
popular. Still, Ramirez said, ``You really don't know how it looks
to the person receiving it.''
</P>
<P>
   There also is no guarantee that all that extra information will
help. Many companies still take written applications more seriously
than those submitted over the Internet because the written ones
tend to indicate a higher level of interest, job search specialists
said. And the size of some applicant pools has been vastly
increased because the Internet has made the resume-writing process
much less time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen Consulting, for example, now receives an astonishing 4
million resumes each year. It uses computer searches to help
determine which 350,000 candidates should be interviewed and which
15,000 should be hired. In other words, the statistical chances of
landing a job at Andersen these days are about 1 in 250.

Fiona Apple/``When the Pawn ...'' (Clean Slate/Epic)
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meaningless 79-word title aside, ``When the Pawn ...'' retains
interest but isn't as immediately accessible as singer-pianist
Apple's triple-platinum 1996 debut, which spawned the ubiquitous
hits ``Criminal,'' ``Shadowboxer'' and ``Sleep to Dream.'' But
that's a good thing since the most rewarding albums generally take
some time to sink in. Fans of the precocious and pretentious Apple
will like ``When the Pawn ...,'' which reflects sturdy songwriting
growth. While radio has taken to the first single, the very catchy
``Fast as You Can,'' with its stop-start rhythms and vaguely
reminiscent melody, there are other equally enjoyable moments to be
discovered here. Producer/multi-instrumentalist Jon Brion colors
Apple's songs with impressionistic string arrangements and hip-hop
rhythms, giving ``When the Pawn ...'' (in stores Tuesday) a
contemporary sound that places Apple's husky, gospel-tinged
delivery on such highlights as ``I Know'' or disc-opener ``On the
Bound'' in sweet relief. 3 stars &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
_ Fred Shuster &QR; 
 &QL; 
Mariah Carey/``Rainbow'' (Columbia)
</P>
<P>
   This well-crafted synthesis of Carey's pure pop instincts and
the streetwise hip-hop rhythms of her most recent work will
probably result in ``Rainbow'' hanging around the charts for a long
time. Bolstered by an army of hitmaking producers such as Jimmy
Jam/Terry Lewis, Jermaine Dupri and David Foster, plus guest shots
from the likes of Jay-Z, Missy Elliott, Snoop Dogg, 98 Degrees and
Usher, the disc is as savvy and entertaining as you might expect.
Among the standouts: the funk-fueled ``Did I Do That?'' Jay-Z's
sharp-edged rapping on ``Heartbreaker'' and the gospel-charged
orchestral ballad ``Can't Take That Away.'' 3 stars &QL; 
_ Fred Shuster &QR; 
 &QL; 
Rage Against the Machine/``The Battle of Los Angeles'' (Epic)
</P>
<P>
   Rage's combat rock resonates. Although their political diatribes
are sometimes painfully naive, the band pulls off what may be the
best hard rock album of the year with ``The Battle of Los
Angeles,'' the pioneering rap-rock quartet's third and finest
release. Sparked by the atonal metallic guitar of Tom Morello
(clearly inspired by Gang of Four's Andy Gill), Rage sounds like it
has finally stumbled across the lost groove on funk essentials like
``Mic Check,'' ``Testify'' and the current modern-rock hit
``Guerrilla Radio.'' Even dreadlocked rapper-singer Zack de la
Rocha's often simplistic tirades grate less than in the past. And
that's saying something. 3 1/2 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster &QR; 
 &QL; 
Mingus Big Band/``Blues &AMP; Politics'' (Dreyfus Jazz)
</P>
<P>
   This is the most fully realized work yet to come from the Mingus
Big Band, the group of rotating musicians dedicated to keeping
alive the hundreds of compositions bassist/composer Charles Mingus
left behind when he died in 1979. Blues and politics were twin
passions for Mingus, and the eight songs selected for this album
still resonate with fire and feeling. The songs, of course, are
glorious (included are such classics as Mingus' tribute to Lester
Young, ``Goodbye Pork Pie Hat'' and the incendiary ``Haitian Fight
Song''), but what makes this album such a delight is the way the
players inject their own personalities into the material. The
talent on display includes trumpeter Randy Brecker, pianist John
Hicks and Mingus himself, providing some narration via the magic of
tape. One of the best jazz albums of the year. 4 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Glenn Whipp &QR; 
 &QL; 
Foo Fighters/``There Is Nothing Left to Lose'' (Roswell/RCA)
</P>
<P>
   Is the Foo Fighters' 15 minutes of fame up yet? Hope so. For
their third album, this most lightweight of radio-rock combos, led
by ex-Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl, again aims to please with simple
slices of guitar-driven bubble-grunge, including ultimately empty
ditties like the MTV-friendly ``Learn to Fly'' and ``Breakout.''
The title of this record sums it all up perfectly. 1 1/2 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster &QR; 
 &QL; 
Counting Crows/``This Desert Life'' (DGC/Interscope)
</P>
<P>
   Producer David Lowery (of Cracker) didn't take any chances with
the latest batch of tunes from this melodic Bay Area roots-rock act
that first hit the charts in 1994 with ``Mr. Jones.'' The problem
with Counting Crows' third studio album is it sounds like one
interminably long song droning on _ as if every track on the arid
``This Desert Life'' boasts the same shuffle rhythm beneath singer
Adam Duritz's dark lyrics and pity-me delivery. Here's hoping the
Crows' forthcoming live shows will inject some life into this dull
material. 2 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster &QR; 
 &QL; 
Various/``Soul Train: The Dance Years'' (Rhino)
</P>
<P>
   Anyone looking for some great party music couldn't do much
better than the four individual discs in this low-priced series
from Rhino. Each disc covers one year _ 1976, '77, '78 and '79 are
featured _ where America shook its collective groove thing with
wild abandon in disco infernos from sea to shining sea. Don
Cornelius' syndicated variety series, ``Soul Train,'' was (BEGIN
ITAL)the(END ITAL) place to play that funky music and these discs
contain the best songs _ famous and obscure _ that the series had
to offer. Guaranteed to produce boogie fever. 3 stars.
</P>
<P>
   _ Glenn Whipp &QR; 
 &QL; 
Stone Temple Pilots/``No. 4'' (Atlantic)
</P>
<P>
   Make it stop. More dreadful middle-of-the-road bubble-grunge
from one of the most offensive members of that special breed, the
Pearl Jam knockoff. Stone Temple Pilots have been awful from the
start, and ``No. 4,'' which isn't going to win these guys any new
fans, proves it once and for all. In the past, though, it sounded
as if singer and frontman Scott Weiland was actually present during
the sessions. This time, it appears he phoned in his parts. Avoid
at all costs. 1 star &QL; 
_ Fred Shuster &QR; 
 &QL; 
Ron Carter Sextet/``Orfeu'' (Blue Note)
</P>
<P>
   Jazz bassist Carter has encountered Brazilian rhythms before _
he helped cut Antonio Carlos Jobim's earliest records for the Verve
and CTI labels before recording with Airto, Flora Purim and many
others. On ``Orfeu,'' Carter, accompanied by such inventive players
as guitarist Bill Frisell and tenor saxophonist Houston Person,
goes straight for the genre's gorgeous melodies, covering the Luiz
Bonfa classics ``Samba de Orfeu'' and ``Manha de Carnaval.'' Other
tracks are Carter originals, including ``Goin' Home,'' an unusual
variation of the melody from Dvorak's ``From the New World''
symphony. 3 stars &QL;

DVDs GO TO WAR  
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: For use Friday, Nov. 5 or thereafter) 
By ROB LOWMAN 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Now I want you to remember that no bastard ever won a war by
dying for his country. He won it by making the other poor dumb
bastard die for his country.'' The late George C. Scott said those
words in his Oscar-winning performance as Gen. George Patton in
``Patton,'' a film directed by Franklin J. Schaffner and written by
Francis Ford Coppola.
</P>
<P>
   In Coppola's portrait, Patton clearly relishes his role on the
historical stage, but he is not a bloodthirsty man. What makes this
larger-than-life character so fascinating is that while he never
wavers in purpose, he _ like the vast majority of men in combat _
is conflicted in his feelings toward war.
</P>
<P>
   This week, five major war films, including the 1970 ``Patton,''
were released on DVD for the first time. Leading the list is the
best war film of all time, Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private
Ryan'' (1998). The others are Terrence Malick's ``Thin Red Line''
(1998); an earlier D-Day epic, ``The Longest Day'' (1962); and
``Tora, Tora, Tora'' (1970), which tells of the Japanese attack on
Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   All of these films can be taken to task in varying degrees for
historical inaccuracies. The most real of these, ``Ryan,'' is a
fictional story (a platoon is sent out to find a Private Ryan at
the front and bring him back safely because all of Ryan's brothers
have been killed in combat). Its depiction of the landing at Omaha
beach on D-Day is so harrowing that the viewer can't help but be
moved by the sacrifices these soldiers made. But the film is more
than horrific visions _ it shows what it took for the individual
soldiers to put themselves on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to explain the math of this to me? I mean, where's
the sense in risking the lives of the eight of us to save one
guy?'' asks Pvt. Reiben (Ed Burns). The answer medic Wade (Giovanni
Ribisi) offers is: ``Hey, think about the poor bastard's mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in conflict that is considered as clearly defined as World
War II _ where ``evil was loose in the world,'' as author/historian
Stephen Ambrose says on a featurette on the DVD _ there is no
simple way to explain a man's decision to fight or put himself in a
position from which he may never return.
</P>
<P>
   This is a question that is behind much of the literature about
war. Ambrose has written about it extensively. James Jones used his
own experiences as the basis for ``Thin Red Line'' and Cornelius
Ryan's book, in which he used interviews with D-Day survivors, was
the source material for ``The Longest Day.'' But the visceral
cinematic experience can be profound in ways that the page can't.
Whether for good or bad is the question.
</P>
<P>
   A number of John Wayne movies, for instance, are clearly
jingoist and propagandistic. Ron Kovic, whose story was told in
Oliver Stone's ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' says his patriotic
fervor to join the Marines was fueled by watching Wayne movies.
Kovic came back from Vietnam in a wheelchair and became an antiwar
activist.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne appears, along with a host of leading men, in ``The
Longest Day,'' the most Hollywood of these five films, but even
here can be found some ambivalence that men in combat feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's dead. I'm crippled. You're lost. Do you suppose it's
always like that... in a war?'' asks a British soldier played by
Richard Burton. ``Day'' doesn't measure up to ``Ryan,'' of course,
but there are some moments, probably thanks to the fact that Jones
co-wrote the script. As with ``Tora,'' there are too many big-star
cameos that distract the story, but both films try to give these
crucial battles some perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Malick's film is brilliant and frustrating at times _ an almost
impressionistic picture of war _ but ultimately has so much to
recommend it, including a volatile performance by Nick Nolte, that
it can't be overlooked. But none of these films should be. While
``Ryan'' is the one to get, the others are among the best war films
ever made. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just as analysts on Wall Street try to predict cycles
in the stock market, collectors and dealers try to track peaks and
valleys in the art market. So the fact that this month's important
auctions of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art will include
many works owned by individuals hoping to cash in on the recent
strong prices has insiders wondering whether this season's sales
can top the 1980s boom.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Monday night, more than $400 million worth of art by
such masters as Picasso, Monet, van Gogh and Degas will be offered
by Sotheby's and Christie's in two marathon spurts concluding nine
days later.
</P>
<P>
   Given the furor over the ``Sensation'' exhibition at the
Brooklyn Museum of Art, the sale of works by two of the British
artists in the show, Damien Hirst and Rachel Whiteread, at
Christie's on Nov. 16 is likely to draw plenty of attention despite
their relatively modest sale estimates. (Nothing from ``Sensation''
itself is being offered.) Mayor Rudolph Giuliani deemed that show
offensive, tried to cut off city funds to the museum and questioned
the financial interests behind the show. Christie's donated $50,000
toward its cost.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, discretionary sellers were hesitant to part with
their art, sensing that the market had not yet reached its peak, so
Sotheby's and Christie's relied primarily on estates for promising
material. Both auction houses also filled their New York sales with
paintings and sculptures being unloaded by Japanese creditors who
have been trying to recoup losses incurred by bankrupt collectors
who overpaid for artworks a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   This season both Sotheby's and Christie's catalogs are bulging
with art from collectors and dealers as well as estates. Consignors
include Donald Fisher, S.I. Newhouse and the heirs of the French
industrialist Auguste Pellerin. The volume is not only greater than
it was a year ago, but estimates are also the highest since the
late '80s. (Sotheby's is offering 11 works whose low estimate is $5
million or more; Christie's has six.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great time in the market,'' said Charles Moffett,
co-chairman of Sotheby's Impressionist and modern art department
worldwide. ``People still remember 10 years ago when they missed
the top, and they don't want that to happen again,'' he said,
referring to the days when a van Gogh portrait made $82 million.
</P>
<P>
   But Franck Giraud, who runs Christie's 19th- and 20th-century
art departments, warned that while sellers have become eager,
buyers are more selective. ``They do their homework,'' he said.
``They are willing to stretch, but only for the very best.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increase in collectors choosing to sell, the
splashiest works being offered come from estates. Sotheby's is also
offering works owned by Prince Jefri Bolkiah, brother of the Sultan
of Brunei, whose well-publicized financial troubles have forced him
to part with some of his art.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the estate works are portraits of two of Picasso's
mistresses, Marie-Therese Walter and Dora Maar. With a $40 million
estimate, ``Seated Woman in a Garden'' a 1938 painting of Maar, is
the season's most expensive work, and one of the best. It comes
from the estate of Eleanore and Daniel Saidenburg, the Manhattan
gallery owners who represented Picasso in the United States from
1955 until his death in 1973. The property includes 16 other
Picassos: paintings, drawings and ceramics.
</P>
<P>
   The Saidenberg works will be sold Nov. 10 in Sotheby's new
salesroom, part of a dramatic $115 million renovation and expansion
of its York Avenue headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 11, Sotheby's will hold its sale of Impressionist and
modern art from various owners. Of 45 works, Prince Jefri's include
some of the best, for example, Degas' ``Little Dancer at Age 14'' a
1922 cast of a dancer with a cream-colored grosgrain silk bodice,
tulle and gauze tutu, fabric slippers and satin hair ribbon. Prince
Jefri bought the bronze sculpture from the collection of William
Mayer Goetz, a founder of 20th Century Fox, and his wife, Edith, at
a Christie's sale in New York in 1988. He paid $10.1 million, then
a record. It now carries a $9 million to $12 million estimate.
</P>
<P>
   The prince is also selling a Modigliani nude estimated to fetch
$12 million to $16 million and a Monet that features the artist's
wife, Camille, reading in her garden. The Monet is expected to
bring $16 million to $20 million, a loss from the $24 million the
prince paid in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's also has its share of star works, though not as many
as Sotheby's. ``Nude on a Black Armchair,'' (1932) its big-ticket
Picasso, expected to bring $35 million to $40 million, presents
Walter asleep with her arms raised over their head. The painting
will be part of Christie's sale of 20th-century art Tuesday. It was
the first in a series Picasso painted of Walter that year while he
was living in Boisegeloup, outside Paris. It is from the estate of
Madeleine Haas Russell, a San Francisco philanthropist who died in
April.
</P>
<P>
   Another estate sale at Christie's, on Monday, is van Gogh's
``Bridge at Trinquetaille,'' an 1888 depiction of an iron bridge
across the Rhone at Arles, painted with his signature heavy brush
stroke. It is estimated to bring $20 million. The van Gogh belonged
to Akram Ojjeh, a Syrian-born financier who died in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Among the best-known discretionary sellers this season are the
heirs of Auguste Pellerin, the French industrialist who died in
1929 after amassing one of the world's greatest collections of
Cezannes. His heirs have been selling bits of the estate for years
now at Sotheby's and Christie's. On Monday, Christie's will sell a
selection of the collection. Besides a Manet and a Rodin, there is
Cezanne's ``Orgy, an 1867 painting of a drunken banquet. The
estimate is $7 million to $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the area of contemporary art, the two auction houses' sales
are strikingly different. To lure young collectors to buy at
auction, Christie's sells only art from the last 30 years in its
contemporary sales. (Works dating from 1945 to 1970 are placed in
its 20th-century art sale.)
</P>
<P>
   There is a group of five works by Damien Hirst, the British
artist known for submerging dead animals in formaldehyde, and one
by Rachel Whiteread. Three of the five Hirsts have been on the
market within the last 18 months. While there are no dead animals
for sale, there is ``Loss of Memory Is Worse Than Death,'' a 1994
piece consisting of a steel cage with formaldehyde containers,
masks, gloves and a syringe. The estimate is $120,000 to $180,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's sale, which encompasses art from 1945 to the present,
offers a more classic mixture of artists. The catalog's cover
features Duchamp's famous urinal, ``Fountain,'' which was barred
from the 1917 New York Armory show. The auction house is selling
the fifth in an edition of eight fabricated under Duchamp's
supervision in 1964. The estimate is $1 million to $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   What stands out in this sale, besides the strong offerings, is
that the majority of the works come from some of this country's
most distinguished collectors, among them Newhouse, David Whitney,
Barbara and Richard Lane, Harry and Linda Macklowe and Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   While Tobias Meyer, the worldwide director of contemporary art
at Sotheby's would not confirm the identities of individual
sellers, he did say that the sale consisted of works being sold by
private collectors. ``These are people taking the opportunity of a
strong market to refocus their collections,'' Meyer said. ``They're
exploring other areas of collecting.''

DON'T READ THIS BOOK: IT'S FULL OF DEATH, HATE AND EVIL
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Friday, Nov. 5)  
(dw) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Herald-Tribune in Sarasota ,  Fla.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is hard to get kids to read these days but the key,
apparently, is to give them books that someone in South Carolina
finds objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure when South Carolina replaced Boston as the seat of
literary hand-wringing. Perhaps it has something to do with
shifting demographics, whatever that means, or else South
Carolinians felt they needed to be known for something other than
Strom Thurmond and she-crab soup.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, I want to thank Elizabeth Mounce and other
Columbia, S.C., parents for getting my 13-year-old son, Michael,
interested in reading again. They did this by complaining to the
state Board of Education that the wildly popular Harry Potter books
by J.K. Rowling have a ``serious tone of death, hate, lack of
respect and sheer evil.''
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing like a book filled with death, hate, lack of
respect and sheer evil to get a 13-year-old boy to put down his
video game (coincidentally called ``Greatest Death, Hate, Lack of
Respect and Sheer Evil Smackdowns of the WWF'' and turn on his
reading light.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Michael began reading the Harry Potter books before
someone in South Carolina found them objectionable, but I don't
think he quite realized how good they were until someone in South
Carolina said they were bad.
</P>
<P>
   That night, Michael ripped through ``Harry Potter and the
Chamber of Secrets,'' which is 341 pages long, in two hours. No TV
breaks. No runs to the fridge for more Surge. Nothing but the sound
of pages being turned.
</P>
<P>
   This from a kid who, for the past year or two, hasn't
voluntarily read any thing except skateboard ads and the song
lyrics of Limp Bizkit. (I advise anyone in South Carolina or
elsewhere who is distressed by the subject-matter of Harry Potter
books to avoid reading, listening or even breathing in the vicinity
of Limp Bizkit lyrics. Your head may explode.)
</P>
<P>
   Michael is so worked up that he's even threatened to write a
snippy column for his school newspaper about reading and censorship
and fuddy-duddy school boards and maybe even Strom Thurmond and
she-crab soup for all I know. Like a toy balloon let go, righteous
indignation tends to travel in a lot of different directions.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, or maybe just coincidentally, the last books that
Michael embraced so passionately were the Goosebumps and Fear
Street series by R.L. Stine, books that also caught flak because of
their ``occult and satanic themes.''
</P>
<P>
   A parent (maybe from South Carolina, maybe not) says the
Goosebumps books are ``too frightening for young people,'' and what
happens? Sales go through the roof &UR; , &LR;  and R.L. Stine is ordering a
better brand of champagne for his yacht.
</P>
<P>
   The way I look at it, I might be able to kindle a lifelong love
of reading in Michael if I can keep him supplied with books that
someone, possibly from South Carolina, thinks he shouldn't read.
The American Library Association was kind enough to provide me a
list in conjunction with its Banned Books Week (Sept. 25-Oct. 2).
These were some of the books that were ``challenged'' in 1998,
meaning that some person or group attempted to have them removed
from a curriculum or library:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Of Mice and Men'' by John Steinbeck; challenged on the basis
of ``offensive language'' and being ``unsuited to age group.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Chocolate War'' by Robert Cormier; written for teens,
this 1974 book has often been challenged for being ``sexually
explicit.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'' by Maya Angelou;
objections center on the explicit description of a rape and other
sexual abuse the author suffered as a child.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Giver'' by Lois Lowry; critically acclaimed novel that
has been challenged for being ``violent,'' ``sexually explicit''
and using ``offensive language,'' and for its treatment of
infanticide and euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
   I'm trying to be optimistic, but I suspect it &UR; ' &LR; s going to take
more than an objection from a parent in South Carolina for my
13-year-old skateboarding/Limp Bizkit fiend to voluntarily read ``I
Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.''

<P>
   Griffey Jr. is just about perfect
</P>
<P>
   By Terence Moorec. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is perfect, but Ken Griffey Jr. is close. He's awfully
close, and not just in his ability to do everything on a baseball
diamond better than just about anybody from any era.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey Jr. is becoming even more of his father's son. As Ken
Griffey Sr. once said, ``I'm amazed how people can't accept that
many of us actually care about our wife and kids. When Kenny talks
along those lines, they're either surprised or they don't believe
him.''
</P>
<P>
   These are reasons that the younger Griffey wouldn't mind
spending his post-Mariners days with the Braves before he heads to
the Hall of Fame. Griffey Jr. officially said this week that he
wants the Mariners to trade him to a team closer to his Orlando
home. Because the Braves hold spring training only a friendly drive
from Griffey Jr.'s front porch, and because Atlanta is an easy
plane ride away during the regular season _ well, you get the
picture. The rest is up to guys in suits.
</P>
<P>
   If the Braves lack the wisdom to acquire Griffey Jr., then life
will go on for this perennial All-Star center fielder with more
home runs before his 30th birthday than anybody. According to
somebody who knows, Griffey Jr. also has the Reds, the Mets and the
Indians on his wish list, because none of those teams play home
games too far from central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't about money for Griffey Jr. Nobody is likely to give
him more than the contract offer of $150 million by the Mariners,
his employers since his rookie season in 1989. It's about winning a
world championship. It's unlikely for the Mariners, but it's
another gutsy player away for the Braves. You know, like Griffey
Jr., who ignored a four-inch metal plate and seven screws in his
left wrist after surgery to slam five home runs during the 1995 AL
Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey Jr. remembers the household lessons of Griffey Sr., the
former Reds great who spent part of his 18 years in the majors with
the Braves. The only thing Griffey Sr. perfected more than
terrorizing pitchers was loving his family.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey Sr. and his wife, Alberta, have been inseparable since
their days as high-school sweethearts in Donora, Pa. Even now, with
Griffey Sr. entering his fourth season as a Reds coach and managing
in Puerto Rico during the winter league, he rarely spends more than
a few hours without either talking about Alberta or talking to her.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Ken Jr., 29, the Griffeys have two other
children, Craig, 28, and Lathesia, 27. Although Griffey Sr., spent
eight of his years in the majors with the Yankees and the Braves,
he insisted that his family stay in Cincinnati. He wanted his
children to have as stable a life as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to Griffey Jr., whose Alberta is named
Melissa. They have a five-year-old son, Trey, and a four-year-old
daughter, Taryn. In the past, Melissa and the kids stayed in
Orlando until school ended in June, and then they left for Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey Jr., wants Orlando to be his children's Cincinnati, and
he wants to be there often to make it happen.

 &HT;    What will it take to get Griffey?
 &HT;    By Tim Tucker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This much seems clear: If the Braves acquire Ken Griffey Jr.,
they will give up Andruw Jones in the deal. The question is: How
much more?
</P>
<P>
   If I'm the Mariners, I start by asking for Kevin Millwood, John
Rocker and shortstop phenom Rafael Furcal _ not rationally
expecting, of course, to get all of that plus Jones.
</P>
<P>
   If I'm the Braves, I start by offering Ryan Klesko _ not
expecting, of course, that Jones and Klesko would be enough to land
an All-Century center fielder in his prime.
</P>
<P>
   So there the negotiations would begin.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners say they hope to get ``four quality players'' for
Griffey. They say they are interested in established major-leaguers
and prime prospects. They need outfielders, corner infielders,
relief pitchers, maybe a young shortstop in case Alex Rodriguez is
next to go, and no one ever turns down starting pitching.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, there are plenty of deals that would be fair for
both the Mariners and the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   I think Jones and Millwood for Griffey would be fair, which is
not to say the Braves, of all organizations, could be easily
persuaded to deal an accomplished young starting pitcher like
Millwood.
</P>
<P>
   I think Jones, Rocker and Furcal would be fair, which is not to
say the Braves, of all organizations, could be easily persuaded to
deal their closer now that they have finally found someone with the
combination of ability and attitude to do that crazy job.
</P>
<P>
   I think Jones, Klesko, Bruce Chen and Kevin McGlinchy would be
fair, although Klesko's status as a highly paid platoon player
might deter the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   There are other potential pieces to a package. George Lombard.
Maybe a pitching prospect such as Jason Marquis or Luis Rivera.
Negotiations presumably would be wide-ranging.
</P>
<P>
   Just how rich the package would have to be depends on two
variables. One is how picky Griffey will be in approving a trade;
the more places he'll go, the higher the price the Mariners will
fetch. Another variable is whether the acquiring team can
successfully negotiate a long-term contract with Griffey before
completing a trade. Obviously, you give up more if he can't leave
as a free agent after one season.
</P>
<P>
   In so many ways, Griffey as a Brave makes perfect sense. He
wants to play near his Orlando home, and neither Florida team is
viable _ the Marlins because they don't have the money to pay him,
the Devil Rays because they don't have the players to satisfy
Seattle. He wants to get to the World Series, and the Braves have
this habit of at least getting there. He apparently is going to
challenge Hank Aaron's career home-run record, and where better
than Atlanta to do that? Heck, he even bats left-handed, and the
Braves' lineup is sorely short of lefty hitters.
</P>
<P>
   But none of those things are the key issue, really.
</P>
<P>
   The key issue is whether adding Griffey to the payroll at, say,
$17 million a year is feasible for a team that already has almost
$30 million a year devoted to three starting pitchers _ Greg
Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz _ and soon figures to pay
Chipper Jones upward of $12 million a year. And if you think the
solution is to deal one of those starting pitchers for Griffey,
remember that they can't be traded without their approval, and
there is no reason to think any of them would want to relocate to
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   So, is adding a Griffey-type salary even an option? In a
rambling discussion of that issue on Wednesday morning, Braves
president Stan Kasten basically said: It depends.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing we don't explore,'' Kasten began. Later, he
said: ``If you ask me in a vacuum _ `Is it doable?' _ it's doable.
Anything is possible. But it requires other things happening. If
you're going to add (a mega-contract), you have to subtract
(elsewhere).
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless, of course, and you hate hearing this, prices are going
to double. That's where that money comes from.
</P>
<P>
   ``We evaluate everything,'' Kasten continued. ``We study. We
evaluate. There are other things that are much closer to happening
than this.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he wouldn't say what things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely nothing has been ruled out,'' he said. ``But if the
headline tomorrow is, `Braves considering Griffey,' that would be
misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he said: ``I probably should have said, `No comment.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The reason you fully expect the Braves to see if they can make
this work is their track record. They found a way to re-sign
Maddux, Glavine and Smoltz, found a way to add Andres Galarraga and
Brian Jordan. ``We always operate over our margins,'' Kasten said.
``Last January, I thought we had put together our best team yet,
and it probably was, until injuries hit. I think when we get to
this January, we also will feel we have put together our best team
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to say: Just do it. Go get Junior. Pay market value,
both in players and dollars. Cut whatever must be cut elsewhere.
Just get him. It's easy to say. And in this rare and special case,
it's the right approach.

 &HT;    Cup controversy fades
 &HT;    By Gleen Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   U.S. players have not been looking forward to this week. The
Ryder Cup participants, in particular, are not excited, despite
enormous financial opportunity and a competition involving the
world's finest players.
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks after the controversy at Brookline, repercussions
seemed possible for today's $5 million American Express
Championship at the Valderrama Golf Club in Spain _ ironically, the
site of the 1997 Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   After the American celebration at the 17th hole at Brookline,
the British media scolded Dunhill Cup players Tom Lehman, Justin
Leonard and Mark O'Meara in Scotland. But the tragic plane crash
that killed U.S. Open champion and Ryder Cup player Payne Stewart
might have changed everything.
</P>
<P>
   The American players went to Spain _ including nine from the
Ryder Cup _ expecting no hard feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before this week, I was very concerned about Valderrama, but
it doesn't really make any difference now,'' Justin Leonard said
Sunday before his flight to Malaga, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's death, followed by the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990
with more than 200 passengers, makes ``(golf) seem trivial
sometimes,'' Leonard said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lehman, who found the Scottish gallery at the Dunhill Cup
lacking the warmth of past visits, all but challenged anyone to
allow the Brookline issue to resurface. Emotions are too raw. The
memory of Stewart's presence on the Ryder Cup team is too fresh.
And golf fans worldwide marveled at Stewart's guts during the
closing holes of the U.S. Open at Pinehurst.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody in Spain asks a Ryder Cup question, they ought to
be shot,'' Lehman said. ``I think (the Europeans) are hurting as
much as we are this week. The Ryder Cup is very small in relation
to all of this.''
</P>
<P>
   It has made the ordeal even rougher for the Ryder Cup teammates
Stewart left behind. One minute, they had experienced a high point
in their entire lives. The next minute they were saying goodbye to
a teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were happy at the Ryder Cup,'' Lehman said. ``We're crying
this week. It puts it all in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis Love III's last-minute decision to play in Spain might
have involved a need to remain with his Ryder Cup teammates in
territory once expected to be hostile. Hanging together last week
during practice rounds proved to be sound therapy, especially with
captain Ben Crenshaw walking with the players. This week, the
recently named 2001 captain, Curtis Strange, will be at Valderrama
as part of the ABC-ESPN broadcast team.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval and Mark O'Meara decided to skip the tournament
before the Stewart tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods is the clear favorite at Valderrama; he has
dominated world golf with seven victories in 10 starts since May.
And after a dismal performance at the Ryder Cup on the same course
two years ago, he is anxious for a rematch. Woods has won eight
more times on the PGA Tour since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if (1997 European captain) Seve (Ballesteros) has
gotten to (the course) or not,'' a smiling Woods said. ``The last
time, he made sure that the fairways were cut in at right around
280, 290, 300 yards. Because our whole team was a long-hitting
team, he took the driver out of our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   To believe headlines in the British tabloids, Woods will have
another million by late Sunday. ``Awesome Woods is playing the best
golf of his life,'' the London Daily Mail said. ``The rest are
playing for second place.''

 &HT;    'Peaceful' attitude helps Inman
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Marietta's Joe Inman kids himself about his ability to
gab. ``Ask Joe what time it is,'' he said, ``and he'll tell you how
to make a watch.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday, even the 50-year-old Inman occasionally had
trouble getting out the words in his post-tournament news
conference after winning the Senior PGA Tour's Pacific Bell Senior
Classic in Los Angeles for the second year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly allowing the tournament to slip away, then
regaining his form with a couple of clutch shots, an emotional
Inman reflected on the week's events in the golf world. He spoke
about a ``peace inside'' that steadies nerves that in years past
might have been his undoing.
</P>
<P>
   A child in a nearby corporate tent yelled during his backswing
at the 17th hole Sunday, making Inman flinch and yank a ball into
the water to jeopardize his three-shot lead, Inman said he ``went
from really in control and feeling calm to, `Oh, my gosh, my world
is crashing down around me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then he thought about the Payne Stewart memorial he had watched
Friday on television and the teary farewell from Stewart's friend,
Paul Azinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told myself, 'Joe, be a man. No matter what happens, it's
nobody's fault. Don't place blame. Look at our whole world. Look
what happened to Payne this week. This is just not that important.
Do the best you can. It's not life and death.' ''
</P>
<P>
   With that focus, Inman pitched to 3 feet and salvaged a bogey;
he eventually won the $180,000 prize by two strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have so much more peace inside,'' Inman said. ``I just
realized after watching everything Friday that was so emotional. I
could see Paul Azinger putting on that tam-o'-shanter hat with his
pants rolled up. . . . It doesn't how many trophies you win. Your
legacy is your children. I don't want to be the richest guy in the
cemetery.''
</P>
<P>
   Molder ranked second
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech has been ranked third nationally in the latest
MasterCard Collegiate Golf Rankings, with Georgia eighth. Georgia's
women's team is ranked fifth. Tech's Bryce Molder is second in the
individual rankings behind Northwestern's Luke Donald. Augusta's
Charles Howell of Oklahoma State is third. Tech's Matt Kuchar is
21st. Georgia's Shauna Estes is seventh in the women's rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Danny Yates will return for another chance to captain
a winning Walker Cup team. He has been selected for matches against
the British Isles on Aug. 11-12 at Ocean Forest Golf Club in Sea
Island. Yates' U.S. team lost in Scotland 15-9 in August. . . .
Former UGA player Chip Beck shot a 69 in the first round of PGA
Tour School second-stage qualifying at Lompoc, Calif. Beck finished
178th on the PGA Tour money list with $137,423. Q-School finals are
Nov. 17-22 at Doral's blue and gold courses. . . . Atlanta's Jason
Bhua had a 71 at Lompoc, Alpharetta's Matt Russell a 73. Other
qualifying sites: At Seaside, Calif., Tommy Roddy, East Point, 79;
John Kimbell, Summerville (70); at Kingswood, Texas, Jody

 &HT;    Monty vs. Garcia for money title
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tiger Woods has taken the suspense from the races for the money
title and the player of the year in the United States. But the
European Tour has a legitimate battle entering today's American
Express Championship in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking a seventh consecutive money title, Scotland's Colin
Montgomerie has a lead of 410,900 British pounds over Sergio
Garcia. Which explains why, with 610,000 pounds available for first
prize at Valderrama, Montgomerie wants to win or root hard for
Woods. A victory by Garcia or England's Lee Westwood would force
Monty to finish second to win the title.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie doesn't see any reason why Woods shouldn't be able
to handle the course that baffled him two years ago in the Ryder
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way Tiger is playing, he is dangerous on any course,
anywhere,'' Montgomerie said. ``He is the hot favorite this week.
He is so far ahead of anyone else in the world of golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie might push for the World Golf Championship events to
generate unofficial money. Montgomerie would have clinched the
European money title if last week's Volvo Masters had been the
cutoff.
</P>
<P>
   American players, including David Duval, Mark O'Meara, Fred
Couples and Lee Janzen, skipped the event and irritated the
Europeans who twice made trips to the United States for previous
WGC events.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are American events with American money and American
TV,'' Montgomerie said. ``If it was a world tour, why was a huge
American flag flying on the first tee at La Costa?''
</P>
<P>
   Meltdown for Daly
</P>
<P>
   John Daly was on the way to his best finish of the season last
week at the Southern Farm Bureau Classic when he suffered a weekend
meltdown. Tied for fifth after two rounds, Daly shot a closing 76,
losing seven strokes to par in three holes on the back nine Monday.
He tied for 35th. . . . Paul Stankowski earned $104,000 for a tie
for third to secure his Tour card for 2000. He finished 113th with
$362,889. . . . PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem said a First Tee
facility will be constructed in memory of Payne Stewart in his
birthplace of Springfield, Mo. Day off helped Woods
</P>
<P>
   Had the PGA not taken Friday off for the Stewart memorial, Woods
still would have been sore after aggravating a nerve in his neck
trying to hit through a rock Thursday. ``My range of motion wasn't
there, and I didn't have the strength,'' he said. ``I maybe was at
60 or 70 percent, and that would have been tough to play at.'' . .
. Indications in Houston were that the Tour Championship would
return in 2003. . . . Duluth's Stewart Cink, who missed the Tour
Championship by finishing 31st for the second year in a row, is
playing in Spain as the 41st player in the world rankings. . . .
Greg Norman was eligible for Spain at No. 48 but did not play.
Jesper Parnevik withdrew, eliminating an 11th event to maintain his
European Tour card. . . . Without any apparent interest in how a
sponsor's name sounds, the PGA Tour has changed the Nike Tour to
the Buy.com Tour. . . . Stewart's spot in the Grand Slam of Golf
probably won't be filled, with Jose Maria Olazabal, Paul Lawrie and
Woods switching to stroke play.

 &HT;    Looking at the bowl picture
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's November, and along with the cool weather, the time has
come to starting projecting the postseason bowl picture. Understand
that these projections are based on a bunch of assumptions. Still,
your brave prognosticator will give it a shot. Here goes.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Georgia Tech finishes 10-1, it looks to be the odd man
out when it comes to getting an at-large spot in one of the Bowl
Championship Series games. Given a choice between a 9-2 Big Ten
team and a 10-1 Tech, the Fiesta Bowl would go with the Big Ten's
TV ratings.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 Penn State will lose one of its final two games, against
Michigan and Michigan State, and land in the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Florida will beat No. 1 Florida State at home Nov. 20 and then
beat either Alabama or Mississippi State for the SEC championship.
That would put the Gators in the Sugar Bowl playing for the
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech will win the rest of its games and go to the Sugar
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State will lose one down the stretch, either to Nebraska
on Nov. 13 or in the Big 12 championship game. Texas will win the
Big 12 championship.
</P>
<P>
   Washington will win the rest of its games and go to the Rose
Bowl from the Pac-10.

   DiCicco steps downc. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   The winningest coach in the history of U.S. Soccer announced his
resignation Wednesday. The coach of the U.S. women's national team,
Tony DiCicco, will step down from the job at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco, who led the team to the 1996 Olympic gold medal and to
the Women's World Cup title this summer, took over at the beginning
of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   His record was 103-8-8 in international matches, a winning
percentage of .899. This year's World Cup champions, in sweeping
the championship as the host nation, captured the imagination of
the American public, particularly women and young female soccer
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. Soccer gave me a tremendous privilege and opportunity
when they hired me for the head coaching position,'' he said
Wednesday. ``I think together we brought women's soccer to a whole
new level, both in America and globally.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco, who has a wife and four sons aged from 8 to 17, spent
as many as 250 days a year on the road as coach of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has met every challenge head on,'' said S. Robert
Contiguglia, president of U.S. Soccer. ``We respect, understand and
admire his desire to share his life with his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Old habits die hard. For the Columbus Crew, being drawn into
Major League Soccer's Eastern Conference playoffs the last three
years against D.C. United has been a dead-end.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-luck Crew ran its RFK Stadium record to 0-12 Sunday in
a 2-1 loss in the opening game of a best-of-three conference
finals. Columbus faces elimination at home this Sunday, 1 p.m. on
Univision.
</P>
<P>
   The Crew cut into a 2-0 United lead with an 82nd-minute goal
from Jeff Cunningham but fell to 0-5 this year against the two-time
MLS champions. ``I'm pretty sick of losing to those guys,''
Columbus midfielder Robert Warzycha said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Western Conference finals, Los Angeles can close out
Dallas, also on Sunday, 3 p.m. on ESPN, after edging the Burn 2-1.
Ezra Hendrickson got the winner when his shot with 40 seconds left
bounced off a Dallas defender and past the near post.
</P>
<P>
   The A-League is doing away with the shootout next season. The
United Soccer Leagues Competition Committee announced Tuesday that
respondents to an Internet survey overwhelmingly favored scrapping
the tiebreaker format for all of its leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The MLS is expected to shoot down the shootout later this month.
Only three of 1,000 fans responding to a USL online questionnaire
said they wanted to keep the shootout.
</P>
<P>
   USL games tied at the end of 20 minutes of overtime will stand,
with each getting a point. Winners still will receive four points,
with a bonus point tacked on for scoring at least three goals. ``We
want to make the tie, or kissing your sister, like kissing the
ugliest sister in a multi-sister family,'' quipped USL commissioner
Francisco Marcos, who was not exactly thrilled with the cyberspace
results. ``We'll see how it goes for a year and then see how many
of these soccer purists there are that say Americans will accept
ties.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet 81 percent of those answering Marcos' own survey said their
reactions were triggered in part by their dislike of the NHL's new
gimmicks to break ties.

SENATE ALLOWS CONTINUED SALE OF GENERIC AIDS DRUGS TO AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Wednesday approved a measure that
would help guarantee access to cheap generic AIDS drugs for African
countries that have been devastated by the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   The measure's approval was a major defeat for the American
pharmaceutical industry, which had pressed Congress to stop foreign
countries from producing generic versions of their drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But AIDS groups applauded the measure's approval, saying the
price of AIDS drugs is critical because the vast majority of the
world's HIV and AIDS cases are in developing countries, where
people can't afford expensive drug cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of drugs that can give men, women and children a
new lease on life, we should not be bickering over obscure trade
policy,'' said Daniel Zingale, executive director for AIDS Actions,
a Washington advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Although exact figures are unavailable, generic drugs tend to be
significantly cheaper than brand name AIDS drugs, which can cost
$12,000 to $15,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict pitting intellectual property rights vs. access to
AIDS drugs began in 1997. That's when South Africa passed
legislation allowing it to circumvent Western pharmaceutical firms
by granting small local companies permission to produce their own
AIDS drugs, or import them from countries, such as India, that make
cheaper generic versions.
</P>
<P>
   However, trade officials and lobbyists for U.S. drug companies
have fought back, pressing Congress to protect intellectual
property rights.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. drug companies appeared poised to win a battle in that
fight early on Wednesday, when the Senate was considering an
African trade bill that would have allowed the U.S. Trade
Representative to impose sanctions on Sub-Saharan African countries
that produce cheaper generic versions of U.S. AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., persuaded Republican
leaders to accept an amendment to the trade bill that would allow
those African countries to continue to produce their copycat AIDS
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said banning these generic AIDS drugs in Africa would
have caused needless suffering and death in countries where AIDS is
so widespread it is a public health emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have generic drugs, you effectively say that
people in Africa are not going to get the treatment that can
sustain life,'' Feinstein said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on the Senate floor, Feinstein said about 34 million
people in Africa _ about the size of the population of California _
are infected with HIV or AIDS. About one-third, or 11.5 million
these people, have died from the disease, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said those deaths represent 83 percent of the total HIV and
AIDS-related deaths worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact of AIDS in Africa is huge,'' Feinstein said. ``It
continues to be a major threat to the well being of the entire
African continent. ... It is clearly in the national interest to
prevent the further spread of HIV\AIDS in Africa,'' she said.

U.S.-GERMAN TALKS ON PAYMENTS TO NAZI-ERA LABORERS POSTPONED 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Faced by growing differences over compensating Nazi-era
slave laborers, German and U.S. negotiators have abandoned plans to
meet this month in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
   The postponement of the meeting, which had been scheduled for
Nov. 16 and 17, reflects the fact that Germany's largest companies
and the government are not ready to raise an offer of $3.3 billion
that they made last month in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized,'' a foreign ministry official, Karsten Voigt,
said, ``that we need more time to convince other companies not yet
involved to offer money toward a settlement, and holding the
meeting now would be pointless.''
</P>
<P>
   The postponement represents an embarrassing setback in a
negotiation that has become increasingly rancorous. Many German
companies feel that they are coming under unreasonable pressure
over what they portray as a moral gesture that is being made
without any legal obligation. No new date has been planned for the
meeting, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Word War II, the German government has paid $80 billion in
war reparations, mostly to Jews who survived concentration camps or
fled. But German companies have never previously come together to
offer significant payments to men and women, many of them non-Jews
from central European countries, including Poland, who were forced
to contribute with their labor to the war effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies already involved will not put more on the
table,'' a lawyer for Deutsche Bank, Klaus Kohler, said Wednesday.
``That is for sure.'' Other corporations that have agreed to pay
include Daimler-Chrysler, Siemens and Degussa.
</P>
<P>
   But negotiators on both sides suggested that it might be
necessary to raise the offer substantially, to close to $10
billion, before there would be any real chance of a settlement.
Lawyers for the former slaves and forced laborers have asked for as
much as $30 billion to settle.
</P>
<P>
   To arrive anywhere close to $10 billion, it appears that many
more than the 35 companies already involved will have to agree to
pay. A wide swath of corporations that have not acknowledged any
use of slave or forced labor have been approached.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the American Jewish Committee in Germany, Eugene
DuBow, said his group had written to 117 companies that it believes
should give money to the fund. Those include Deutsche Telekom,
Preussag, Robert Bosch, Bertelsmann and the German subsidiaries of
Ford and General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   But until now, DuBow said, the responses have not been
encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   If additional companies do come forward with payments, it
appears possible that the government will raise its total in the
same measure, despite severe budgetary constraints, officials said.
Of the $3.3 billion already offered, one-third is from the
government.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Most of Germany's major corporations are aware that even if they
might mount a successful legal defense of a refusal to pay _ New
Jersey courts have recently found in their favor _ the damage to
their businesses in the United States stemming from a failure to
reach a settlement could be considerable.
</P>
<P>
   The two main categories of people who would receive money are
slave laborers, essentially people required to work in
concentration camps, and forced laborers, people deported from
countries invaded by the German army and also made to work.
</P>
<P>
   Some German officials said irritation had been fueled by the
fact that although the Holocaust was a peculiarly German act, the
use of slave labor was not. Yet, they said, the United States had
not pressed claims with Japan, and Germany has declined to press
claims with Russia over Germans deported to Siberia after the war.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOKONBAYEVA, Kyrgyzstan _ The fiercest and most successful
hunter in these parts, heir to a tradition that stretches back many
centuries, does not use a rifle or a bow and arrow. His weapon is a
magnificent golden eagle who is also his intimate friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been together more than 30 years,'' the hunter,
Sulaymanbekov Kutuldu, said on a recent afternoon as he gently
stroked the eagle's breast. ``He loves me and he knows I love him.
We understand each other perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   The bird perched on Kutuldu's leather-gloved arm was a splendid
specimen, nearly 4 feet tall with a sharp, curved beak and piercing
eyes. He lives in a room of his own adjoining Kutuldu's house, and
no child was ever treated more tenderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't hunt for anyone else,'' Kutuldu said. ``Other voices
mean nothing to him. He doesn't react to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunting with eagles is not to be confused with falconry, which
Kutuldu disdains as a pastime for children and dilettantes. Eagles
are used for hunting nowhere in the world except here in Kyrgyzstan
and in some parts of neighboring Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether about 100 men still hunt with what they call the
``god of birds.'' Kutuldu, 65, is one of a handful of acknowledged
masters.
</P>
<P>
   During a normal four-month hunting season, he and his eagle bag
50 or 60 foxes, a dozen badgers, a couple of lynx and four or five
wolves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolves are very smart, very hard to catch,'' he said. ``But
eagles are super-strong and aggressive. Even wolves are afraid of
them. Eagles aren't afraid of anything. They'll fight a fox, a
wolf, even a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Here on the southern shore of Lake Issyk-Kul, the largest body
of water in this landlocked nation, the hunting season starts in
late autumn. As it approaches, Kutuldu takes his eagle out every
day to prepare him.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing an ankle-length velvet cloak to protect him against the
winds that sweep down from nearby mountains, Kutuldu holds his
eagle close and speaks to him softly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Easy,'' he murmurs over and over. ``Easy, boy. You're such a
good boy. You're a good eagle, a great eagle. The season is going
to start soon. Get ready. Get ready now. We're going to have a
great season.''
</P>
<P>
   The capture, taming, training and keeping of eagles is highly
ritualized. Most of the birds, which have a life span of about 40
years, are caught when very young _ either snatched from a nest or
trapped in a baited net.
</P>
<P>
   Once captured, the eagle is hooded and placed in a cage with a
perch that sways constantly, so it cannot rest or sleep. For two or
three days it is also deprived of food. During this time, the
berkutchi, as an eagle hunter is called, talks, sings and chants to
it for hours on end. Finally he begins to feed and stroke it.
Slowly the weakened creature comes to rely on its master.
</P>
<P>
   When the berkutchi decides that their relationship has become
strong enough, the training begins. Kutuldu has one of his sons
drag a fox fur behind a galloping horse, and soon the eagle learns
to pursue and swoop down on it.
</P>
<P>
   Not all eagles can be trained, but those who take to life with a
master display intense loyalty. Although they are not tethered,
they always return after killing their prey. The eagle is not given
a name.
</P>
<P>
   On hunting days, Kutuldu rises well before dawn and fortifies
himself with a breakfast of yak meat and fermented mare's milk.
While dressing, he explains his plan to his eagle. Then they set
out together, Kutuldu on his horse and the eagle on his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Foxes usually move about in the very early morning, and Kutuldu
has ways of flushing them out of their lairs later in the day. When
he spots one, he shouts a command and the eagle takes off.
</P>
<P>
   Eagles rarely fail to catch their prey. They usually kill it
quickly by breaking its neck with their powerful claws. The only
game animal around here that they cannot overpower is the ibex, a
large mountain sheep. But Kutuldu's eagle has killed several by
pushing them off mountain ledges.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are secrets to understanding an eagle's mentality,'' he
said. ``You have to feel its moods and cycles. I have students, and
I teach them how to catch eagles and train them and hunt with them.
But I don't give away the real secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   Kutuldu said he might pass these secrets on to his eldest son,
who is now 20, but not any time soon. For now, the son hunts only
with falcons, something Kutuldu would never lower himself to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of the question,'' he said with evident contempt. ``I'm
too much of a hunter to use a puny little falcon.''

JUSTICES URGED TO REINSTATE FORMER MENTAL PATIENT'S LAWSUIT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Texas attorney urged the Supreme Court on
Wednesday to reinstate the lawsuit of a former mental patient who
claims Dallas psychiatrists kept him hospitalized against his will
for care he did not need.
</P>
<P>
   Federal courts in Texas have rejected, on procedural grounds,
Mark Rotella's claim that doctors needlessly admitted him to
Brookhaven Psychiatric Pavilion in Dallas in February 1985, when he
was 16 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Rotella, who spent 479 days in the hospital on what he calls a
trumped-up diagnosis of borderline personality disorder and major
depression, alleges the unnecessary hospitalization was part of an
illegal conspiracy in which the doctors were paid to fill hospital
beds.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. District Court in Fort Worth, followed by the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, ruled that Rotella missed
the four-year window in which he had to sue the doctors under the
federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act,
popularly known as RICO. He waited 11 years after his 1986 release
from Brookhaven before suing in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Houston attorney Richard Hogan Jr., pressing Rotella's appeal
before the justices, said the lower courts erroneously counted the
four-year time limit from when Rotella was released from the
hospital in 1986. Hogan said the four-year clock should have begun
in 1994, when the hospital's corporate owner pleaded guilty to
federal fraud and conspiracy charges and paid a $350 million fine.
</P>
<P>
   It was that 1994 plea by National Medical Enterprises Inc. that
first put Rotella on notice that he had a potential conspiracy
claim against the doctors under RICO, Hogan said. Rotella's 1997
lawsuit, filed within four years of the plea, therefore satisfied
the law's statutory deadline for filing a claim, the attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas attorney Charles Frazier Jr., representing the doctors,
countered that the lower courts correctly dismissed the lawsuit
because it was filed too late. Rotella knew or should have known he
had a potential lawsuit when he was released from the hospital,
where he claimed he had been held against his will, Frazier argued.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, however, asked the attorney how
Rotella could have known he had a racketeering claim against the
doctors before the hospital pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Frazier said people suing individuals and companies
have a responsibility to investigate all their potential claims
diligently. Laws, such as RICO, encourage such diligence by
imposing limits on the time in which people can file suit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The justices are expected to render their decision in the case,
Rotella vs. Wood, by July.
</P>
<P>
   Rotella's lawsuit against the doctors is one of nearly 1,000
civil cases brought by former patients at Brookhaven and other
psychiatric hospitals once owned by National Medical Enterprises
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet Healthcare Corp. took over for NME in March 1995, closed
Brookhaven Psychiatric Pavilion and inherited the company's legal
problems. In the summer of 1998, Tenet paid $100 million to settle
700 wrongful hospitalization lawsuits filed in Texas, The New York
Times reported.

 &HT;    Lady Bulldogs looking good, again
 &HT;    By Norman Arey and Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM _ Even though he went to the Women's Final Four last
year and two of his prinicipal nemeses _ Tennessee and Connecticut
_ were glaringly absent, Georgia coach Andy Landers isn't about to
declare the Lady Bulldogs the team to beat nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Although Georgia, which returns four starters, is ranked as high
as No. 2 in several preseason polls and Sports Illustrated nosed
around the program last week _ almost a sure sign a No. 1
coronation is in the works _ Landers insisted Wednesday that the
Lady Vols and Huskies are more talented teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``What our Final Four experience showed was that you don't have
to be the most talented team to play for a national championship,''
he said at the SEC's annual Basketball Tipoff. ``We weren't last
year, and we're not this year.''
</P>
<P>
   _Good loss, bad loss
</P>
<P>
   When Duke stunned Tennessee in the Elite Eight last season, all
assertions that the Lady Vols' dominance was bad for the sport
evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   Although they finished 31-3 and lost four-time All-American
Chamique Holdsclaw, the Lady Vols are ranked in the preseason top
three. They boast two other All-Americans, juniors Tamika Catchings
and Semeka Randall, and the best recruiting class in the country.
But the SEC is stronger this year, and no fewer than six other
teams can legitimately be considered national championship
material.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we went 39-0 two years ago, we captured a lot of
attention for our sport,'' coach Pat Summitt said. ``The loss (to
Duke) was good for women's basketball, but it wasn't good for us.''
</P>
<P>
   _Gator talk
</P>
<P>
   Florida senior guard Kenyan Weaks said Georgia native Donnell
Harvey is just what the Gators needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donnell is one of the best rebounders in the country right
now,'' Weaks said of the former Randolph-Clay player. ``He gets mad
at us during practice for not shooting because he wants to get the
rebound.''

 &HT;    Rider expected to play in home openerBy Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Isaiah Rider probably will be in uniform tonight when the
Atlanta Hawks host Milwaukee in their inaugural game at Philips
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Rider, who missed the season-opener Tuesday at Washington, did
not attend Wednesday's practice. But he met with general manager
Pete Babcock later in the afternoon after working out on his own at
Philips Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the best way to describe it is that J.R. needed more
time to collect his thoughts and get on track,'' Babcock said.
``Having to go (to Dallas) and take care of his grandfather's
funeral arrangements had to be a trying experience for him.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the issue of leaving the team without explanation,
Babcock said he hoped Rider and the team could close the door on
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows he should have informed us,'' Babcock said. ``He
apologized for being out of sync. I encouraged him to improve his
communications so we should be contacted immediately. We'll know
how to deal with it from that point. He said he would work at it
and try to do better.''
</P>
<P>
   Babcock, noting that he expects Rider to play, said the two
discussed the ``issues of moving forward and how do we get the most
out of our team.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Rider will be coming off the bench as the Hawks'
sixth man. But coach Lenny Wilkens said Monday that Rider on the
bench ``is not necessarily a permanent situation.''
</P>
<P>
   With Rider, Wilkens will have more options against Milwaukee, as
he searches for a combustible offense lineup. The offensive leader
in the opener was Roshown McLeod, who scored 22 points -- and said
he thinks that he might have scored more with Rider in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, if J.R. had played, I'd have gotten 30,'' McLeod
said Wednesday after a team practice. ``With J.R. on the floor, the
defense is going to double, and I'm going to get a lot more open
looks and more open shots.''
</P>
<P>
   After a spotty rookie season with the Hawks in which an injury
and a severe bout of flu held him back, McLeod took a step forward
in summer-league play, tore the medical collateral ligament in his
right knee and now has worked beyond that injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt in my mind I can score,'' he said. ``I'll get us some
points. Put J.R. in there and I'll do even better.''

 &HT;    Kelly making himself known on the line
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeff Kelly was nearly invisible during Falcons training camp.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Falcons' rookie middle linebacker learned his way
around, he started making big noise and big plays at practice.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly is one of several rookies and second-year players who have
played more this season because of injuries to starters. And
playing time seems to be healing the wounds of inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole preseason and into a couple of games, I was trying
to get my fit down,'' Kelly said. ``I remember telling somebody,
`When I get comfortable, you'll start hearing me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly had five tackles in relief of starter Jessie Tuggle
against the Saints and a team-high nine tackles at Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   When the season began, two second-year players, weak-side
linebacker Keith Brooking and left guard Bob Hallen moved into the
starting lineup. Other injuries helped move into the lineup running
back Ken Oxendine and wide receiver Tim Dwight, two more members of
the 1998 draft class. They scored all three touchdowns in Sunday's
27-20 victory over Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFL, the lack of experienced depth caused by the
realities of the salary cap means that every team is a few injuries
away from getting a lot younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system we run has always put pressure . . . on younger
players being able to play quicker,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``We
do have an unusual amount.''
</P>
<P>
   Oxendine replaced the injured Jamal Anderson and, after a slow
start, rushed 17 times last Sunday for a career-high 64 yards and
his first touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight, who gained fame as a rookie for his exciting skills as a
kick returner, became a starter after Chris Calloway was slowed by
ankle and knee injuries. Reeves has hinted at reducing Dwight's
return role because an injury would hamper the Falcons at two
spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love doing kicks and punts,'' Dwight said. ``I don't want to
give it up. That's part of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwight has three touchdown receptions this season, including
catches of 35 and 4 yards against the Panthers. The inexperience
has something to do with the Falcons' 2-6 record. Teams normally
pay when they make such swaps as Oxendine for Anderson, Dwight for
Tony Martin and second-year quarterback Tony Graziani for Chris
Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   But it could be good for the future, because nine starters will
become free agents after the season.
</P>
<P>
   Some young players, however, have been slower to catch on.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Michael Booker, the team's first-round draft choice
in 1997, was expected to compete for a starting position, but an
injury to his right thigh has kept him out of three games.
</P>
<P>
   Hallen was replaced after six games by Greg Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   Jammi German, the team's third-round draft choice in 1998, had
the first four catches of his career in a two-game span, but he
broke a finger and hasn't caught a pass in the last three games.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Omar Brown, a fourth-round choice in '98, was the
Falcons' special-teams MVP against Carolina, but he hasn't played
defense yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also have had some disappointments through the draft,''
Reeves said. ``Guys like (third-round choice and fullback) Jeff
Paulk -- he probably had 10 plays in college. We have more running
plays than he had in his entire attack in college. Really, you
can't tell for two or three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Mentioned most frequently as possible future stars are
second-year players Brooking, Dwight and right tackle Ephraim
Salaam, rookies Patrick Kerney and Jeff Kelly and even
practice-squad wide receiver Eugene Baker.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can call it cockiness or arrogance,'' 10-year wide
receiver Terance Mathis said. ``Jeff Kelly has a lot of confidence.
A guy like that will play a long time. Some of these guys are
figuring it out.''

BUSH FOCUSES ON PERSONAL TOUCH IN N.H. TOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEREDITH, N.H. _ On the shores of Lake Winnipesaukee, in the
banquet room of the Chase House resort, Texas Governor George W.
Bush shook every single hand held out to him Wednesday before
uttering a syllable of his stump speech.
</P>
<P>
   He did the same thing in Littleton at the Elks Club the night
before, spending an hour and a half moving from one rectangular
table of ten to the next, signing his name on napkins, making small
talk and thanking people for coming to see him. All the while, the
mood music was strictly country as the sound system blared out
favorities like ``Boot Scootin' Boogie.''
</P>
<P>
   With an intensified schedule and more personal attention to the
voters, Bush spent a day and a half in the first-primary state
atoning for his absence from last week's Republican town hall
meeting in Hanover, and making up for what some see as his
all-too-rare visits here. But if his actions begged forgiveness,
his words did not.
</P>
<P>
   He took an aggressive, so-sue-me tone when queried about the
seriousness with which he is addressing New Hampshire voters. He
joked at several stops that he heard there had been ``a little bit
of a flap'' about his wife, Laura, recently. (Bush had said he
could not attend the GOP get-together because she was receiving an
award in Dallas the same night.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to apologize for anything,'' Bush said Wednesday,
just before leaving for Delaware. ``I made the right choice as far
as I'm concerned and that's what matters. People can either accept
that explanation or not.''
</P>
<P>
   They accepted it at the Littleton Diner, a town gathering spot
since 1930. He roamed the narrow eatery, plopping down at each of
the booths to talk to people such as Jane Bath of Easton, who was
lingering over dinner with her 12-year-old granddaughter, Natalia
Westlund.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him if he's half as decent as his folks, he's got my
vote,'' Bath said. ``He's had very good role models. I like his
politics and he's cute.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Gibson, a beefy man with multiple tattoos, asked Bush if
he's going to cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I am,'' Bush replied, smiling and moving on to the next
table.
</P>
<P>
   That was good enough for Gibson, who lives on disability
payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's down to earth and I think he should be
president,'' he said. ``I don't criticize him because he wasn't
here last time because family comes first.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush did spend part of his day trying to make amends, meeting
privately Wednesday with about two dozen local party officials from
Belknap and Grafton Counties to assure them he would be spending
much more time in the state. (Only Utah Senator Orrin G. Hatch has
visited less frequently than Bush.)
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been so busy and not able to do the kind of grass-roots
important in New Hampshire,'' said Christopher D. Boothby, a
Belknap County Commissioner and Bush co-chair from this picturesque
lakeside village.
</P>
<P>
   But as Bush worked the room here, kibbitzing all the while,
Boothby looked on approvingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly what the Bush campaign needs, a return to the
grass-roots,'' Boothby said. ``He's not just shaking and moving on,
he's shaking and stopping to talk to the people, that's the crucial
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is also stopping to take more questions from voters than he
has in past trips. Some are friendly, some are softballs and,
occasionally, he encounters a little hostility.
</P>
<P>
   At the Elks Lodge in Littleton, a man accused him of supporting
discrimination against gays and asked for his view of
homosexuality, such as whether he believes it is a sin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all sinners, buddy, and far be it for me to cast a
stone,'' Bush said, struggling to get a word in edgewise. He also
said he supports the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy for gays in
the military, and he said he believes marriage is for men and women
only. He said he is opposed to discrimination of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   More than once, in Littleton and again in Meredith, Bush was
asked about his view of the nuclear test ban treaty, which recently
failed in the Senate, Each time, Bush said he didn't support it.
But then he used the question to make an impassioned plea for free
trade, citing trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm giving you more of an answer than you want, but I'm
unloading,'' he said Wednesday. ``It's called filibustering.''
</P>
<P>
   Other times he tried to give a quick answer and then scoot on to
something else. When he was asked whether poor towns should be able
to sue rich towns to help pay for public education, Bush stoutly
declared that the federal government should not tell communities
how to fund their schools. It is a problem New Hampshire has been
grappling with for years, and Bush said he hoped a local solution
is reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean to be dodging your question,'' he said, then
paused and smiled. ``Maybe I do mean to be dodging your question.''

MALE HAIRS GROWN ON FEMALE ARM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an unusual experiment that suggests a potential new way to
grow hair and offers insight into tissue transplantation without
rejection, researchers report they've successfully induced cells
from a man's hair follicles to sprout a few hairs on a woman's
forearm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strange experiment to do,'' admitted Dr. Clifford
Lawrence, a consultant dermatologist with the Royal Victoria
Infirmary in England, and one of the authors of the paper in the
journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the strangeness of the experiment is a serious
scientific purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The paper's two main authors _ Amanda J. Reynolds and Colin A.B.
Jahoda, who are husband and wife and researchers at the University
of Durham in England _ have long been interested in identifying
cells that when transplanted can grow new tissue that is not
rejected by the recipient, according to Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   Their research has primarily involved rodents _ until now.
Jahoda was the source of the hair follicle cells, while Reynolds
came up with the idea of transplanting them into her own forearm,
Lawrence said.
</P>
<P>
   Since there was the possibility of a severe rejection reaction,
the experiment was Reynolds' ``leap of faith, as it were,''
Lawrence said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have known that certain tissue, from the brain and
cartilage, for example, exhibit a phenomenon known as ``immune
privilege,'' where the cells do not mount a normal immune response
against foreign substances, said Angela Christiano, another
co-author of the paper and a Columbia University associate
professor of dermatology and genetics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hair follicles have always been thought to be immune
privileged. This is actually the first time that it's been
demonstrated,'' Christiano said.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the general mechanism behind immune privilege
could perhaps one day lead to tissue and organ transplantation
without rejection, according to researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Another first of the study, according to the authors, is its
demonstration that a whole follicle of hair can be grown with the
transplantation of only a few hundred cells, from what's called the
dermal sheath at the base of the hair follicle. Humans are born
with only so many hair follicles, and until now it had never been
thought possible to grow new ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to find the bit (of tissue) that had the
message in it that could tell the skin to form a follicle,'' said
Lawrence. In fact, he said, the experimenters initially threw away
the sheath cells that were deep in the skin, thinking they had
nothing to do with signaling follicular growth, but used them in
the study.
</P>
<P>
   A total of five dark brown hairs grew in the fairer-haired
Reynolds' forearm four weeks after the transplant, and were left to
grow for up to 75 days. The hairs were then taken out and
genetically analyzed by Christiano, and confirmed to be Jahoda's
hair.
</P>
<P>
   The technique used in the study is unlike any used by hair
transplant surgeons today, in that it actually grew hair follicles,
and involved transplanting one person's hair into another person's
skin.

INGROWN MADNESS OF SAN FRANCISCO POLITICS CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By   
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The 1999 mayor's race wouldn't end, and already
I was seeing the beginnings of the 2003 race. Sorry, no end in
sight to the ingrown madness of San Francisco politics.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ammiano was at his headquarters, the Josie's Cabaret and
Juice Joint, talking about how his last-minute write-in campaign
brought out hundreds of disaffected voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The victory's ours in terms of that involvement,'' he said
just before midnight Tuesday, before his votes were counted. ``No
matter what people think on the issues, I was there. I gave it a
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of this election, he wants to be there
giving it a shot in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Those vying to inherit Willie Brown's mantle were at the mayor's
party in the acoustic hell of Longshoremen's Hall. This was the
younger generation of ``San Francisco's official family,'' as
Assemblyman Kevin Shelley put it.
</P>
<P>
   Shelley boomed humorlessly on about Brown's love for San
Francisco and its people. All I could think about was how we'd miss
Brown's speeches someday.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Mabel Teng played cheerleader, making people say
Willie Brown's name more times than anyone cared.
</P>
<P>
   Treasurer Susan Leal said something passionate and sensible, but
it was hard to hear her in the concrete bowl of a hall.
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea at all what Supervisor Gavin Newsom said, because
I was standing in a group of people (OK, women) who talked about
how ``Kennedyesque'' he is.
</P>
<P>
   There's your front-runner in the year 2003 right there.
</P>
<P>
   Then Mayor Willie Lewis Brown got up for his middle hurrah, and
gave a speech that made them seem like a convention of the ego
deficient.
</P>
<P>
   Brown graciously conceded his superiority over his challengers,
while admitting he underestimated how hard being mayor is.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those speeches they've been making,'' he said. ``They have
no idea how tough this job is.''
</P>
<P>
   He thanked all his fellow politicians who helped his campaign,
including President Clinton, who recorded a telephone endorsement.
Then he jabbed Clinton by saying, ``Thank God for politicians
without a lot to do.''
</P>
<P>
   This was vintage Willie Brown, talking compassion for those
without a place to live, taunting his critics, and promising true
greatness and cleaner streets for San Francisco in the next four
years.
</P>
<P>
   He also told his supporters to stop chanting his name so much
because it was prime time, and he wanted it for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he would ultimately win, but challenged his opponent
in a runoff election to a knock-down, drag-out series of
substantive debates in all 11 supervisorial districts of San
Francisco. He said everyone in every neighborhood knows him, and
``Every other candidate should undergo the same scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate challenge seemed clearly directed at the man who got
in the race late and avoided the first round of debates, Supervisor
Tom Ammiano.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Who?'' as one of Brown's staffers put it.
</P>
<P>
   Deb Janes, was passing out pens to voters so they could write in
Ammiano's name. Those voters were told to pass the pens on to
someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the left has been beat up for the last few years, and
finally that's changed,'' said Janes, who sees Brown as the mayor
of big business and big box stores. ``There are a lot of us who
were depressed by the mayor's race. It's almost like we weren't
going to let him not run.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Conkin, a retired journalist for the gay Bay Area
Reporter, had been out of town for a month and returned to find all
these politicized people and ``a new energy'' in an old lineage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom is in Harvey Milk's lineage,'' said Conkin. ``We have
progressive politics in San Francisco again, and what really is a
grass-roots movement.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked around the room at the curious collection of gays,
lesbians, lefties and the left out. ``I don't see any hacks here,''
said Conkin.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose the hacks he was talking about were all at Brown's
event in Longshoremen's Hall. I know many of those people, and they
have high ideals and would hate to be called hacks.
</P>
<P>
   One of my friends pointed to the largely Latino, Asian and
African American crowd and said, ``Look at my new family that I
have because of Willie Brown. That's the California of the next
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd at Ammiano's headquarters was the California of the
next millennium, too. What we have here is competing next
millenniums.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Kopp, son of Quentin Kopp, was a lot like his father in his
outspokenness and rangy build _ and quite unlike his dad in his
shaved head with one peroxided topknot hanging between his eyes.
Kopp said his dad, the legendary Grinch, and Ammiano, the
starry-eyed leftie, have a lot in common as mavericks and straight
talkers.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ammiano's much-criticized last-minute write-in campaign,
Kopp says, ``I think it was a hell of a move.''
</P>
<P>
   Kopp, who plays with a rock band called Stark Raving Brad, says
he and his artist and musician friends are being driven out of town
by high prices, and San Francisco is losing its creative and human
edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's make a stand here,'' he said. ``What's more important,
money or culture? Willie's answer has been pretty clear.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked Kopp when he was going to run for mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to have it together by 2003,'' said Kopp the
younger and balder.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad. He'd be a nice addition to the mix.

 &HT;    Cinnabon to open in Philippines.
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cinnabon Inc. said Wednesday it had signed its largest
international franchise deal ever. The Atlanta company will open 70
bakeries and cafes in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is with Manila-based Southwest Maritime Corp.
</P>
<P>
   On the heels of that agreement, the division of Atlanta-based
AFC Enterprises also reached a deal with Sugakico Systems to build
60 units in central Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Both are significant milestones for the cinnamon roll bakery
retailer, which was founded in 1985 and acquired by AFC about a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last year we have international commitments that will
double the size of the company, and these are two of the biggest
deals,'' said Jerry Bell, vice president of international
development for AFC. ``That's the big news.''
</P>
<P>
   The combined value of the deals is estimated at $9 million,
which includes fees and royalties. Most of the new bakeries in the
Philippines and Japan will be located in shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
   International markets represent a strong growth vehicle for
Cinnabon, industry observers say. ``You're not going to find much
resistance,'' said Scott Hume, managing editor of Restaurants and
Institutions magazine. ``Baked goods are pretty universally
appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hume said many of the major restaurant chains are continuing to
explore overseas markets. ``Obviously, the population dense areas
are where people have seen success and expect to see more.''
</P>
<P>
   Since AFC acquired Cinnabon, the company has signed agreements
in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Dominican Republic, Canada, Thailand,
Singapore, Vietnam and Venezuela. Currently, there are 375 Cinnabon
bakeries in the United States and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   AFC has delved into international markets before with its
Churchs Chicken and Popeyes Chicken &AMP; Biscuits divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Within the last few weeks, Popeyes has moved into Europe and
South America. The company opened a restaurant in Poland, with an
agreement to open two more there. Popeyes also plans to open units
in Suriname , formerly known as Dutch Guinea. AFC also owns
Torrefazione Italia Coffee.

OVERBLOWN `LEPRECHAUNS' STILL MANAGES TO ENTERTAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Magical Legend of the Leprechauns,'' in the true excessive
fashion of executive producer Robert Halmi Sr. (``Gulliver's
Travels,'' ``Noah's Ark,'' ``Merlin''), tries to be more than it
should.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the four-hour miniseries ends up surprising
everyone, being more than it probably ever intended.
</P>
<P>
   The miniseries (9 p.m. Sunday and Monday) takes the legends of
fairies and leprechauns and mixes in a heaping spoonful of Romeo
and Juliet.
</P>
<P>
   The result is unexpected: A light but telling parable of the
modern-day Troubles in Northern Ireland, one that is cautionary yet
still fun.
</P>
<P>
   The miniseries is one of four television ``events'' hitting the
airwaves Sunday, joining the telemovie ``Annie'' on ABC (7 p.m.),
miniseries ``Shake, Rattle &AMP; Roll'' on CBS (9 p.m. Sunday and
Monday) and the premiere on Fox of what likely will be the final
season of ``The X-Files'' (9 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 7 could be a day that will live in infamy for the network
that bombs (yeah, we know when Pearl Harbor was).
</P>
<P>
   In ``Leprechauns,'' the fairies, the ones in white (orange would
have been too over-the-top) who control things like the balance of
nature, and the leprechauns, the common-folk masses in green, are
immortal enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Then the slightest of slights, fueled by misunderstanding,
prejudice and rumor, proves enough to spark a war that could end
both their world and the one inhabited by humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds sadly familiar, doesn't it? But for eons the violence was
mostly verbal, occasionally violent, but never fatal. Until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leprechauns'' opens with Jack Woods (Randy Quaid), an American
businessman who comes to the hinterlands of Ireland for what he
tells people will be a vacation. What he does not realize is the
cottage he has rented is inhabited by leprechauns who, unseen,
share Ireland with humans.
</P>
<P>
   When Woods saves their antagonistic leader, Seamus Muldoon (Colm
Meaney), the wee people become visible _ but at first only to
Woods. Later Woods tries to woo the feisty Kathleen (Orla Brady),
but their relationship is endangered when she finds out the real
reason he is in Ireland, and what it could do to her land.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the Shakespearean relationship. That would be
the illicit romance between the fairy Princess Jessica (Caroline
Carver) and Muldoon's son, Mickey (Daniel Betts). Their love starts
a war; could it end one, too?
</P>
<P>
   Roger Daltrey (lead singer of The Who), looking oddly like Terry
Jones of ``Monty Python's Flying Circus'' in heavy makeup, plays
the leader of the fairies, King Boric.
</P>
<P>
   Looking over the combatants is The Grand Banshee (Whoopi
Goldberg), who is all-seeing, all-knowing, but declares if the
fighting continues, the once-immortals will die. And they do.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is a breezy tale, albeit one littered with about 16
too many Irish cliches (we thought NBC got that out of the way last
year with its failed ``Trinity.'').
</P>
<P>
   The pipes, the thatched cottages, the jigs _ it's all too much.
And the headstrong, semi-older single Irish lass who must take care
of her grown brothers in a parentless household is a role that
should have been retired with Maureen O'Hara.
</P>
<P>
   Quaid, hardly a first-choice romantic lead (there is a Top 10
understatement), still provides a sardonic wit necessary for a man
whose world is turned upside-down by the discovery of another
universe.
</P>
<P>
   But the miniseries is fueled by Meaney, best known for his role
as Chief Miles O'Brien on ``Star Trek: The Next Generation'' and
``Deep Space Nine.''
</P>
<P>
   Meaney is best when he is back on Earth, in his native Ireland,
playing roles like Morgan the Goat in ``The Englishman Who Went Up
a Hill But Came Down a Mountain'' (1995) and Dessie Curley in the
1993 BBC movie, ``The Snapper,'' which was released theatrically in
the States.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Meaney is one of the more interesting character actors on
screen, especially in full brogue. He carries the series, despite
his two-foot frame.
</P>
<P>
   And despite its big themes, intended or otherwise,
``Leprechauns'' is a fun little story.

BE FREE JOINS PROFITABLE RIDE OF INTERNET IPOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Be Free Inc., a small firm offering Internet marketing services
to on-line merchants, saw its stock triple in its first day of
public trading Wednesday as it became the latest in a string of hot
Massachusetts technology companies to hit Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   By late morning, Be Free shares had risen 19 from their opening
price of 12, to 31, as 5.2 million shares had already changed
hands. The stock closed up 17 at 29, on volume of 13.6 million
shares, boosting the firm's market capitalization to $760 million.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's IPO made Be Free's biggest investors rich. Board
member Ted Dintersmith, a general partner at Charles River
Ventures, saw the value of his 4.5 million shares reach $130.5
million by the end of the day. So did Michael Humphreys, a board
member and general partner at Matrix Partners, who owns the same
number of shares.
</P>
<P>
   Be Free, a company that trades on the Nasdaq stock exchange
under the symbol BFRE, helps on-line portals that serve as guides
to the Internet and merchants check the performance of their
advertisements and promotions on various Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The company tracks and then analyzes the number of ``hits'' at a
particular advertising site on the Web to determine which sites
generate income and which are more apt to get a client's message
across. That information allows marketing firms to choose custom
links to match the content of the ad.
</P>
<P>
   Be Free, a Marlborough, Mass. company, has 190 clients,
including BarnesandNoble.com, GoTo.com, and American Greetings.
</P>
<P>
   The company was founded in 1996 by Samuel Gerace, 35, and his
brother, Thomas Gerace, 28. Sam Gerace was running Pexis Inc. in
Pittsburgh, a database-marketing company, that was combined with Be
Free when he joined his brother, Thomas, who had been a case writer
at the Harvard Business School. The two founders saw their
ownership stakes worth $49.3 million each by the end of Wednesday.
Chief executive Gordon Hoffstein, who joined Be Free last year, saw
his ownership reach $55 million in value.
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception, the company has received more than $35
million in venture capital funding from such investors as Highland
Capital Partners, Charles River Ventures, Matrix Partners, and TTC
Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the company's stock was priced $2 above its range,
most likely because it was benefiting from a robust market as well
as enthusiasm over its operating model.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their business model is quite unique,'' said Randall Roth, a
senior analyst at Renaissance IPO Fund in Greenwich, Conn. ``Other
companies are paid according to how many people actually see an ad.
This company and its clients do not care how many people see the
ad. Intead, they are concerned about the number who purchase goods
after clicking onto the ad, something that is not currently being
offered by other performance marketing firms.''
</P>
<P>
   Be Free is considered unique because the merchants and portals
using its services pay a fee only when a promotion leads to a sale,
which takes place when the customer clicks on an advertisement and
then moves to the merchant or portal site to purchase an item.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which employs 154 workers, generated about $3.1
million in revenue between September 1998 and September 1999, Roth
said.

ALLISON OUT FOR THREE WEEKS WITH TORN ARM MUSCLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Bruins will be without high-scoring center Jason
Allison for as much as three weeks with a torn muscle in the left
forearm.
</P>
<P>
   Allison, tied for the team's scoring lead with linemate Dave
Andreychuk (12 points), would prefer to think he just needs some
time away from the rink.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm optimistic about it, that it might not be too long a
thing. It's not a typical thing that's wrong,'' Allison said
Wednesday during practice in Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if it's going to get better fast or not. This
(time off) is the first test. We'll have to see if it gets better
in a couple of days or in a couple of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison has undergone some magnetic resonance imaging tests, but
they had been difficult to read.
</P>
<P>
   The quickest way to heal the wrist is to immobilize it, but that
might cause damage down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things they could do with other people, but it's not
good for an athlete to do because there's something about the
tendon snapping,'' he said. ``It's not good and you could have
major problems with it. It's not a specific thing, either. You
could get tendinitis, you could get swelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison skipped Wednesday's practice and will miss Thursday's
game against New Jersey. He is not sure when he'll get back on the
ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a setback,'' coach Pat Burns said. ``We're not sure how
much time (he will miss). It could be a couple of weeks. We're
going to have to bite the bullet until he gets back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Healthwise, it's the most important thing. If your team stays
healthy, you have a good chance. And if your top players go out,
it's very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison has been hampered by an ailing right wrist since the
spring. But Allison injured his left wrist during practice Oct. 19
in Phoenix when he collided with teammate Hal Gill. It felt better
the next day and he was able to play in Los Angeles, but he said it
was made worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to get it to the point I can play healthy,'' he
said. ``I've felt decent for about four games this year, if that,
where I started to feel better and I could play my game and not be
thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The wrist didn't get better, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two games, against Buffalo and Tampa, I wasn't
grabbing guys, I wasn't hooking guys, and I know those things
aggravate it. I wasn't battling down low and I was getting rid of
the puck quicker than normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get in there and you wrestle a little, and that stuff I
couldn't do at all. And if I did do that, it would have been very
painful for the next 20 minutes where I probably would not have
been able to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   The only time Allison missed a game as a professional was after
undergoing hand surgery while in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel strongly I want to play every game,'' he said. ``If
it's not getting better the whole year, it's not something I can do
anything about.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison doesn't want to take time away from the game and have
the injury re-appear again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it will get better, but I have to be smarter with it.
There's no time frame, whether I get back in a week, two weeks or
three weeks,'' he said. ``There's one thing I'm adamant about: If
it feels a lot better and I see a doctor and he says it's good
enough to start playing, I'll start playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to make sure I don't mess it up,'' he said. ``I could
be out three days or three weeks with his. I still have to be smart
about it.''

AN `AFFIRMATION' FROM SAVAGE GARDEN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Darren Hayes of chart-topping Australian duo Savage Garden has
firmed up his New Year's Eve plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm staying home,'' he declared. ``The expectations
surrounding that night have been blown way out of proportion. I
think a lot of people are just gonna stay home like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes and partner Daniel Jones hope those stay-at-homes will be
listening to Savage Garden's just-released second album,
``Affirmation'' (Columbia), co-produced by the Grammy-winning
Walter Afanasieff (Ricky Martin, Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, Michael
Bolton).
</P>
<P>
   Savage Garden's 1997 self-titled debut reached worldwide sales
of 11 million thanks to such hit singles as ``I Want You,'' ``To
the Moon and Back'' and ``Truly Madly Deeply.''
</P>
<P>
   To inspire his songwriting last year, Hayes moved to New York
from his native land Down Under.
</P>
<P>
   ``I placed myself in adverse conditions because I was intent on
making a record that could be a soundtrack, not just to my life but
to everybody's lives,'' he explained. ``I experienced ... the
normal day-to-day struggle of being in a new place.''
</P>
<P>
   The hardship paid off. The album's first single, ``I Knew I
Loved You,'' a ballad Hayes describes as a ``very simple love
song,'' is rising fast on the Top 40 chart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first album was recorded on a dime with the vocals done in
bathrooms,'' Hayes said. ``This was the other extreme.'' &QL;

RESEARCHER SAYS DEATHS DURING GENE THERAPY WERE REPORTED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Contradicting federal health officials, a Boston heart
researcher said his company did inform the National Institutes of
Health about two deaths that have occurred in a high-visibility
gene therapy study.
</P>
<P>
   However, an NIH spokesman said Dr. Jeffrey Isner failed to
report the deaths immediately. ``The guidelines are clear and
specific on that matter,'' said spokesman Donald Ralbovsky.
</P>
<P>
   NIH officials said this week that Isner, of St. Elizabeth's
Hospital in Boston, and Dr. Ronald Crystal of New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in New York failed to report a
half-dozen deaths that have occurred in gene therapy trials being
conducted independently by the two researchers. Both physicians
hold equity interests in companies whose business plans partly
depend upon the success of this cutting-edge research.
</P>
<P>
   The studies are testing two novel approaches that aim to grow
new coronary blood vessels to bypass patients' clogged arteries _
one of the hottest areas in the fledgling field of gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Isner and Crystal Wednesday insisted they had not concealed the
deaths. Not only were the Boston deaths reported to the NIH
directly in August, but both Isner and Crystal said they had
published reports on some of the deaths and discussed others at
public scientific meetings.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Boston deaths occurred a year ago, and the other in
July, Isner said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Isner and Crystal also said they had promptly reported all
the deaths to the US Food and Drug Administration, as required by
law. But officials in the NIH office, which has looser authority
over gene therapy, noted this week that FDA reports are kept
secret, and that researchers should report study deaths to NIH
officials as well so the news can be widely disseminated.
</P>
<P>
   Isner and Crystal said, in separate interviews, that there have
been a total of eight deaths among 100 patients enrolled in studies
conducted by the two competing research teams. The Washington Post
reported Wednesday six deaths between the two separate studies.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy comes at a time when results of the first
large-scale human studies of various gene therapy approaches are
just emerging. The death of an 18-year-old man in a University of
Pennsylvania gene therapy study in September has sensitized
regulators and researchers to the possibility of unexpected hazards
in the brand-new field.
</P>
<P>
   However, the heart researchers said the deaths in their studies
involved older patients with end-stage heart disease who were
considered beyond the help of conventional heart surgery because
their coronary arteries were so severely blocked. The one exception
was a patient being treated with gene therapy for clogged leg
arteries, but he died of pancreatitis, Crystal said, which was
unlikely to be related to the gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Boston deaths involved a 71-year-old woman who died
about six months after genes for a blood vessel growth factor
called VEGF-1 were injected into her heart. The other was a
59-year-old man who received genes for VEGF-2, a slightly different
growth factor, about four months ago, and died within 24 hours of a
heart rhythm disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, and in the six cases in Crystal's studies, the
researchers decided that the deaths were not due to gene therapy.
They said in interviews that FDA reviewers agreed with them,
allowing the studies to go forward.
</P>
<P>
   The situation raises old ethical questions in a new context. For
instance, should researchers running human studies own stock in
companies that stand to benefit from the study outcome _ as both
Isner and Crystal do? When clinical researchers do have equity in
such companies, should these researcher-investors be relied on to
make public serious adverse effects, such as deaths, that occur
during the studies?
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Medical School's policy does not allow researchers with
substantial financial interest in companies to participate in
clinical trials of their products. But medical schools at Tufts
University, Boston University, and elsewhere do not have such
proscriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel comfortable with the way things are,'' Isner said when
asked about his dual roles as Vascular Genetics stockholder and
leader of the gene therapy trial.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal, who owns stock in GenVac, a company sponsoring the gene
therapy experiments with Parke-Davis Warner Lambert
Pharmaceuticals, said he is ``sensitive to the issue'' that stock
ownership may color reporting of results. He said he does not plan
to be involved in Phase II gene therapy trials, which test
efficacy, but defended his right to participate in Phase studies,
which are aimed at demonstrating safety.

CHINESE GOVERNMENT NOT EXPECTED TO LET-UP AGAINST FOLLOWERS OF
FALUN GONG 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING, _ Has it come to this: that the Chinese Communist Party
is terrified of retirees in tennis shoes who follow a spiritual
master in New York?
</P>
<P>
   So it has almost seemed here during recent days of bizarre
arrests and flying invective against the Falun Gong movement.
</P>
<P>
   As security forces worked frantically to pick up believers who
converged on Beijing to plead Falun Gong's case, the government
left no doubt that it intends to wipe out all organized traces of
the movement _ even if that requires jailing thousands of people
who never considered themselves enemies of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Behind closed doors in recent weeks, many Chinese, from
professors to cab drivers, have said the government has
overreacted. Many say its blunt repression of a spiritual movement
that attracted hordes of ordinary people seeking health and
happiness will cause a lasting social wound.
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts say that even so, China's communist leaders
probably saw little choice. Their first principle is preserving the
rule of the party, which they equate with protecting social
stability. And they have consistently tried to stamp out any
competing loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Logically, they had to do this,'' said Suesheng Zhao, a
Chinese-born political scientist at Colby College in Maine who is
currently a visiting fellow at Stanford. ``For the Communist Party,
the greatest threat is a nationally organized force.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its founding in 1992, Falun Gong, a mix of cosmic healing
theories, Buddhism and Taoism that promises salvation in a corrupt
world, has gained millions of followers _ retirees, middle-aged
women and even many officials and students, who gathered regularly
in public parks to practice their mystical exercises.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the party, this was a big problem,'' said Roderick
MacFarquhar, a professor of Chinese politics and history at Harvard
University. ``The party cannot allow the existence of a rival mass
organization with control over the hearts and souls of the ordinary
people _ and exposing their own ideological vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the group was outlawed on July 22, unknown thousands of
its core believers have refused to fade away, creating an
unexpected crisis and forcing the government to mobilize all its
media and social organizations, even bosses in many work places, to
engage in ritual condemnations.
</P>
<P>
   In the months since the ban, official vilification of the group
and its elusive founder, Li Hongzhi, who moved to New York in 1998,
has grown ever more shrill _ a sign that the eradication campaign
has not gone smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, senior communist legislators described Falun Gong
as ``unprecedented in the 50-year history of the People's Republic
in terms of its size of organization, influence, number of illegal
publications as well as the damages it brought to society,'' the
New China News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   These were strong words for a group that had received little
high-level attention before it held an unauthorized vigil in
Beijing on April 25, when some 10,000 members from several
provinces quietly gathered around the leadership compound to
protest published critiques of their movement and to demand
official recognition.
</P>
<P>
   By its very existence _ and as government officials later
charged _ this gathering was the most serious challenge to
Communist Party authority since the student-led demonstrations of
1989.
</P>
<P>
   When they outlawed Falun Gong, the authorities charged that Li
and a small cabal of leaders had a secret political agenda to
subvert the nation, though no evidence was offered.
</P>
<P>
   Li, who keeps in touch with an expanding global following on the
Internet, insists he has no political aims. He has never advocated
the overthrow of Communist rule or even a more liberal policy on
religion. And his believers insist they just want to be left alone
to focus on their inner ``cultivation.''
</P>
<P>
   But the believers have also been quick to mobilize in defense of
their movement, in hundreds of smaller protests before and since
the giant April demonstration in Beijing. In China, such defiance
of authority is inevitably considered deeply political.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has retreated from many spheres of personal and
social life, the Communist Party still demands the stated
allegiance of every organization. But as is evident in their
willingness to face arrest, the more fervent followers of Falun
Gong give their supreme loyalty to Li and what they consider his
life-transforming theories.
</P>
<P>
   When it banned Falun Gong, the government brought a variety of
criminal charges against Li and arrested a number of top
organizers. Thousands more who persisted in proclaiming their faith
have since been detained or harassed in cities all around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing over the last 10 days, more than 3,000 protesters
were rounded up as soon as they were detected, officials said. Many
were bused back to their hometown police for ``re-education,''
which may mean loss of jobs or time in labor camps.
</P>
<P>
   But the police seem unable to mop up a core of believers, in
Beijing and elsewhere, who say they are prepared to risk everything
for their faith and have made smart use of e-mail, mobile phones
and pagers to communicate with each other and with supporters
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the effort to discredit and destroy Falun Gong,
using the familiar scripts of Communist dictatorship, has shifted
into high gear.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, in an effort to bolster the moral and legal case,
the party's newspaper, People's Daily, featured a front-page
commentary arguing that Falun Gong is an ``evil cult'' that any
government would have to suppress.
</P>
<P>
   The rank-and-file believers, it said, were mere dupes of Li's
``sorcery.'' Small numbers of people continue to operate under Li's
``remote control,'' it said, and are ``unable to see the
blood-soaked truth.'' Chinese authorities have blamed the group for
at least 1,400 deaths of members who refused needed medical care.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, another People's Daily editorial said, ``Like all
cults, Falun Gong is an anti-social, anti-human, anti-science and
anti-government malignant tumor.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR;  &LR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The group does have some cultlike features, including fervent
devotion to one man's offbeat doctrines, obsessive secrecy and
often extreme reactions to criticism. Master Li, as followers refer
to him, has been caught dissembling about aspects of his
background, about his presence in Beijing just before the April
demonstration and about some of his wilder claims of supernatural
powers, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   But the government offered no convincing evidence for its
comparisons of Falun Gong to the Jim Jones cult, whose members
committed mass suicide, and the Branch Davidians, who died while
under FBI attack in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese who sampled Falun Gong in recent years, usually to see
if it would improve their health and spirits, say that beyond the
purchase of books, they were never asked to hand over large sums of
money to the group. While differing loyalties to Falun Gong
sometimes caused bitter divisions within families, followers were
not asked to cut all normal social bonds. Nor, in contrast to the
more notorious cults, was it difficult to leave the group.
</P>
<P>
   The reported deaths of believers who refused medical treatment
pose a far more complex issue than the official victim counts would
have it, especially in a country where many people believe that
cosmic forces influence health and rely on traditional treatments
not always supported by modern medicine.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday the national Parliament, laying one of the final
planks for coming show trials, adopted a stringent anticult law
that was tailored expressly for prosecution of Falun Gong leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, in a step being strangely touted as progress
toward the ``rule of law,'' prosecutors charged four reported
ringleaders with major crimes under that new law _ for actions
supposedly taken months before it was adopted.
</P>
<P>
   In China's long history of authoritarian government, the danger
to rulers from emerging national organizations has been repeatedly
demonstrated, said Zhao, the political scientist.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson was not lost on Mao Tse-tung, Zhao noted. During his
Cultural Revolution of 1966-1976, for example, Mao sent in army
troops to disperse the Red Guards he had created as soon as local
groups began to coalesce into broader entities. Mao had brutally
crushed a religious sect in the 1950s, undoubtedly mindful of how
mystical movements like the Taiping rebels and the Boxers disrupted
the country in imperial times.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with rising unemployment, anger over official corruption
and a slowdown in economic growth, the government feels insecure
and vulnerable, many experts say. The authorities also worry about
the long-term effect of new communications technologies _
skillfully wielded by Falun Gong and democracy advocates _ on the
party's ability to monopolize power and public discourse.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders are only beginning to hint in public about the
possible extent of their Falun Gong problem. Until this week,
official statements about the crackdown stressed that while a small
number of top leaders would be harshly punished, other adherents
would simply need education about how they had been duped.
</P>
<P>
   But an article Monday in People's Daily described for the first
time the likelihood of ``long-term resistance.'' Beyond the top
leaders, it said, ``second and third tiers'' of leaders have been
created.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a few areas, illegal meetings are still being held,'' the
article said, the only clue for Chinese readers of the continuing
subterranean struggle.

BAY STATE AUTO INSURANCE RATES TO RISE 0.7 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts drivers will once again face just a
slight increase in their insurance premiums next year, though
consumer advocates say a rate reduction was actually in order given
the level of industry profits in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance Commissioner Linda Ruthardt said next year's rates
would rise an average of 0.7 percent, which amounts to an average
$6.14 increase. Auto insurers now have 30 days to present proposals
for special discount programs, which could help reduce rates for
good drivers.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the rate hike, Ruthardt was approving the exact
figure reached in a settlement agreement involving the auto
insurance industry, the attorney general's office and her
division's State Rating Bureau. Each year, these parties present
evidence to the commissioner for increases or decreases in rates;
this year, they worked out a settlement themselves earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   While it was unusual for the settlement to be announced publicly
before being presented to Ruthardt's office, the commissioner said
she was ultimately impressed with the other parties' analysis of
the information.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed reasonable based on the evidence we had,'' she said
in a phone interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   However, Deirdre Cummings, consumer program director for the
Massachusetts Public Interest Research Bureau, said the settlement
seemed far from reasonable. She said drivers deserved lower, not
higher, premiums for next year.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had hoped the commissioner would reject the
settlement, especially in light of the fact that her division's
State Rating Bureau had initially called for more than a 6 percent
rate reduction for next year after reviewing actuarial information
from auto insurers. She said there was considerable evidence that
auto insurers enjoyed immense profits in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed the commissioner went along with this
agreement,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Automobile Insurers Bureau of Massachusetts, which could not
be reached for comment, had asked for a 7.8 percent rate hike for
next year.
</P>
<P>
   For the past six years, drivers in this state have been spared
major rate hikes. Last year, auto insurance rates also went up an
average of 0.7 percent; in the four years preceding that the
average premium went down.

BAY STATE EMBRYO CASE COULD SET NATIONAL PRECEDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL REZENDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Locked away in legal limbo at a fertility clinic, in a
vial submerged in liquid nitrogen, are four frozen human embryos a
Massachusetts woman would like to carry to term to expand her
family.
</P>
<P>
   But the the woman's ex-husband, who helped create the embryos,
has no interest in fathering more children with her. And, he says
he should have some say over what happens to the embryos, as he did
over other posessions the couple divided when they divorced.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the Supreme Judicial Court will grapple with the
question of what should become of the microscopic fertilized eggs,
and could tackle legal and ethical issues few other states have
addressed: What is the legal status of a human embryo? Is it
property, a person, or something in between?
</P>
<P>
   And should a man have any say in preventing a pregnancy
conceived outside a woman's body _ a right that currently belongs
to women who get pregnant through intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   The case is being carefully watched in Massachusetts, a national
center for fertility treatments. And anti-abortion forces, already
antagonistic toward new SJC chief justice Margaret Marshall, have
weighed in with their own legal filing on the case, arguing for the
woman's right to have the embryos implanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision will be very significant in Massachusetts and,
because the SJC is such a well-respected court nationally, it's
likely to be followed in other places around the country,'' said
George Annas, a law professor at Boston University's School of
Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   The highest courts in two other states have weighed in on embryo
custody cases involving divorce. In 1992, the Tennessee Supreme
Court, ruling in a case where there was no written agreement
between a divorced man and woman, said that Junior Lewis Davis
could not be forced into fatherhood by allowing his wife to have
their embryos implanted in order to give birth.
</P>
<P>
   And last year, New York's Court of Appeals ruled that five
contested frozen embryos would be donated to research and
ultimately destroyed, as outlined in an agreement, even though
Maureen Kass wanted to use them to become pregnant over the
objections of her former husband.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of the frozen embryo case here, known as A.Z. v.
B.Z., has been underscored by the SJC's decision to review it
without waiting for an Appeals Court decision -- a move typically
taken in cases involving novel issues, matters of great public
interest or constitutional challenges.
</P>
<P>
   For the woman, who is appealing a probate court ruling stemming
from her divorce permanently barring her from using the embryos,
the SJC's move comest at a vital time. The woman is 44 and the
policy of the fertility clinic she attends is to not implant
embryos into women over 45.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clock is definitely ticking given that my client will be
45 in June,'' said Gretchen Van Ness, the woman's attorney. ``We're
very happy the court is hearing this so quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Van Ness, the case hinges on seven consent forms
signed by the man and woman while they were still married regarding
the disposition of embryos created through in-vitro fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   Under this procedure, eggs extracted from the woman are combined
with sperm from the man. The eggs are frozen after fertilization
and later implanted in the woman's uterus.
</P>
<P>
   Because the couple agreed in writing on more than one occasion
that the right to use the embryos would revert to the woman in the
event of a separation, Van Ness says the case can be decided
without wrestling with the thorny issues revolving around legal
status of frozen embryos.
</P>
<P>
   She also says it can be decided without considering whether a
man involved in the creation of an embryo outside a woman's body
has a right to prevent pregnancy after fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement they made before they separated incorporates all
of their private, moral and ethical beliefs,'' Van Ness said.
``They are the right people to make the decisions about all the
complicated questions.''
</P>
<P>
   But in his 1996 probate court decision, Judge Anthony R. Nesi
ruled that the consent agreements were invalid because, among other
things, a fertility clinic handbook said the consent agreements
were ``good for one year'' and because of ``a change in
circumstances'' unforseen by either the man or woman.
</P>
<P>
   The new circumstances noted by Nesi included the fact that the
woman had given birth to twins as a result of in-vitro
fertilization with her then husband. It is to protect these
chidlren that the probate court agreed to withold the names of the
man and woman in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In ruling in favor of the man, he said the woman still had the
option of further in-vitro fertilization with another partner as
well as adoption.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that if the woman were allowed to use the
contested embryos and give birth, the man would face responsibility
for additional children he does not want.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were the wife to use the pre-embryos, he would face unwanted
parenthood encompassing all of the financial, psychological, and
legal responsibilities and consequences,'' Nesi wrote. ``Any parent
or care-giver knows, without the need for enumeration, how intense
the responsbltiies of parenthood can be.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case currently before the SJC, the man has not entered an
argument on his own behalf. Paula H. Noe, the attorney who
represented him in the probate court trial, said his fate in this
case will be based on Nesi's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Noe said she continues to believe in her former client's
right to prevent his ex-wife from giving birth to children with
eggs he fertilized.
</P>
<P>
   She also said her former client was wronged when his wife made
an unsuccessful attempt to become pregnant again by using embryos
they created without his knowledge. Before they were divorced, the
man learned of his wife's attempt through an insurance notice
covering the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clinic in many ways was also at fault because it was
performing a procedure on one-half of the patient,'' Noe said.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever way the SJC rules, some experts believe the courts
might not be the best place to resolve the many issues raised by
frozen embryo custody cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legislature could solve this by statute if it wanted to by
saying frozen embryos can only be used for procreation wih the
consent of both parties,'' Annas said.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Efforts by two leading presidential candidates
to increase the role of churches and other faith-based groups in
attacking social problems drew fire Wednesday from Texas religious
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Several Protestant ministers and one rabbi said the ideas
advocated by Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore
would threaten constitutional guarantees of religious freedom and
help dismantle the government's safety net for the needy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have chosen literally to pass the buck to the religious
community to care for those in need,'' said the Rev. Dr. Larry
Bethune, pastor of University Baptist Church of Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Bethune said churches and other religious institutions will
continue to do their part but added, ``We do not need the
government to tell us how to minister to human needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Peter S. Berg of Temple Emanu-El of Dallas said the
so-called ``charitable choice'' proposals may be well-intentioned.
But he warned of an ``erosion of constitutional safeguards'' and
said he feared that ``minority religions would inevitably lose
out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jews have learned throughout history that both religion and
the state function best when each is encouraged to flourish in its
own sphere,'' Berg said.
</P>
<P>
   The religious spokesmen were part of the Texas Faith Network,
which claims more than 400 religious leaders across the state as
members. They spoke at a news conference organized by the Texas
Freedom Network, an affiliate group that has fought social and
religious conservatives over several political issues.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a Democratic candidate for the White House, has spoken in
general terms about the need for ``new partnerships'' between
government and religion in expanding social programs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Republican presidential front-runner, has been more
specific and has made faith-based programs an important part of his
self-styled ``compassionate conservative'' agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding on initiatives he promoted in Texas, Bush earlier this
year proposed spending about $8 billion in federal funds to support
charities and provide tax breaks to encourage charitable giving.
</P>
<P>
   He also promised to seek changes in federal regulations to make
it easier for religious groups to apply for federal funds for
nonsectarian, charitable programs. He said the proposal wouldn't
cross the constitutional line between church and state and pledged
not to discriminate ``for or against Methodists or Mormons or
Muslims or good people of no faith at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 federal welfare reform law already encourages private
and religious charities to provide welfare services.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan on Wednesday said the governor
was trying to ``create an environment where faith-based and
charitable organizations can voluntarily help those in need without
compromising their religious integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Texas religious leaders said they feared there wouldn't
be enough safeguards to guard against religious discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under `charitable choice,' a hungry person may find it
necessary to submit to a partisan prayer,'' said the Rev. Jim
Rigby, pastor of St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church of Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under `charitable choice,' a sick person may have to seek
health care from a religion which believes in faith healing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rigby said that charitable choice is the ``latest in a long line
of euphemisms meant to disguise the fact that we are dismantling
the social safety net that was once called welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Chuck Merrill, senior pastor of University United
Methodist Church of Austin, said that government needed to improve
its own commitment to providing for the needy instead of increasing
a reliance on churches.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Texas ranks near the bottom of the states in the
amount of public assistance that it provides.

RESEARCHER SAYS DEATHS DURING GENE THERAPY WERE REPORTED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Contradicting federal health officials, a Boston heart
researcher said his company did inform the National Institutes of
Health about two deaths that have occurred in a high-visibility
gene therapy study.
</P>
<P>
   However, an NIH spokesman said Dr. Jeffrey Isner failed to
report the deaths immediately. ``The guidelines are clear and
specific on that matter,'' said spokesman Donald Ralbovsky.
</P>
<P>
   NIH officials said this week that Isner, of St. Elizabeth's
Hospital in Boston, and Dr. Ronald Crystal of New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in New York failed to report a
half-dozen deaths that have occurred in gene therapy trials being
conducted independently by the two researchers. Both physicians
hold equity interests in companies whose business plans partly
depend upon the success of this cutting-edge research.
</P>
<P>
   The studies are testing two novel approaches that aim to grow
new coronary blood vessels to bypass patients' clogged arteries _
one of the hottest areas in the fledgling field of gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Isner and Crystal Wednesday insisted they had not concealed the
deaths. Not only were the Boston deaths reported to the NIH
directly in August, but both Isner and Crystal said they had
published reports on some of the deaths and discussed others at
public scientific meetings.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Boston deaths occurred a year ago, and the other in
July, Isner said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Isner and Crystal also said they had promptly reported all
the deaths to the US Food and Drug Administration, as required by
law. But officials in the NIH office, which has looser authority
over gene therapy, noted this week that FDA reports are kept
secret, and that researchers should report study deaths to NIH
officials as well so the news can be widely disseminated.
</P>
<P>
   Isner and Crystal said, in separate interviews, that there have
been a total of eight deaths among 100 patients enrolled in studies
conducted by the two competing research teams. The Washington Post
reported Wednesday six deaths between the two separate studies.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy comes at a time when results of the first
large-scale human studies of various gene therapy approaches are
just emerging. The death of an 18-year-old man in a University of
Pennsylvania gene therapy study in September has sensitized
regulators and researchers to the possibility of unexpected hazards
in the brand-new field.
</P>
<P>
   However, the heart researchers said the deaths in their studies
involved older patients with end-stage heart disease who were
considered beyond the help of conventional heart surgery because
their coronary arteries were so severely blocked. The one exception
was a patient being treated with gene therapy for clogged leg
arteries, but he died of pancreatitis, Crystal said, which was
unlikely to be related to the gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Boston deaths involved a 71-year-old woman who died
about six months after genes for a blood vessel growth factor
called VEGF-1 were injected into her heart. The other was a
59-year-old man who received genes for VEGF-2, a slightly different
growth factor, about four months ago, and died within 24 hours of a
heart rhythm disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, and in the six cases in Crystal's studies, the
researchers decided that the deaths were not due to gene therapy.
They said in interviews that FDA reviewers agreed with them,
allowing the studies to go forward.
</P>
<P>
   The situation raises old ethical questions in a new context. For
instance, should researchers running human studies own stock in
companies that stand to benefit from the study outcome _ as both
Isner and Crystal do? When clinical researchers do have equity in
such companies, should these researcher-investors be relied on to
make public serious adverse effects, such as deaths, that occur
during the studies?
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Medical School's policy does not allow researchers with
substantial financial interest in companies to participate in
clinical trials of their products. But medical schools at Tufts
University, Boston University, and elsewhere do not have such
proscriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel comfortable with the way things are,'' Isner said when
asked about his dual roles as Vascular Genetics stockholder and
leader of the gene therapy trial.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal, who owns stock in GenVac, a company sponsoring the gene
therapy experiments with Parke-Davis Warner Lambert
Pharmaceuticals, said he is ``sensitive to the issue'' that stock
ownership may color reporting of results. He said he does not plan
to be involved in Phase II gene therapy trials, which test
efficacy, but defended his right to participate in Phase studies,
which are aimed at demonstrating safety.

US SHIFTS POLICY, TO LIFT EMBARGO ON YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seven Serbian opposition leaders Wednesday won
several concessions from the Clinton administration, including a
pledge that the United States would lift an oil and air embargo if
free elections were held in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The US policy shift would provide a boost to the democratic
movement inside Serbia, the opposition leaders told reporters
Wednesday. Zoran Djindjic, the president of the Democratic Party,
even said the opposition received ``more than we expected'' from
the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian opposition, long plagued by internal rifts, has come
together on at least one major goal in its aim to unseat Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic: fair and free elections.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright dismissed any chance
that Milosevic would win reelection, saying, ``I find that really,
really hard to believe'' considering ``he terrorizes his
population.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolstering the belief of Milosevic's unsteady perch are
September polls done by the US firm Penn, Schoen &AMP; Berland
Associates that found two-thirds of Serbian voters want Milosevic
to resign. The poll of 840 people in face-to-face interviews has a
margin of error of 3.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, commissioned by the National Democratic Institute of
Washington, found 72 percent disapproved of Milosevic's job
performance and 64 percent blamed Milosevic for Serbia's poor
economic condition. Only 2 percent blamed the NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are absolutely convinced of the outcome of free and fair
elections,'' said Milan St. Protic of the Alliance for Change.
``It's only a matter of time . . . until Milosevic leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, though, is not up for election soon. He has held the
office of president for 10 years, during which his country has lost
four wars and witnessed its economy wither.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current sanctions, bootleggers have benefited greatly
from smuggling in outlawed goods, which has helped persuade the
Clinton administration to alter its policy, analysts believe.
</P>
<P>
   Albright Wednesday also said that the United States backed a
European initiative to deliver $5 million worth of home heating oil
to cities run by opposition parties. The United States wants to
observe the program before committing funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole embargo plays into the hands of mafia-like
structures and helps Milosevic blame the hardships faced this
winter on the foreigners,'' said a foreign diplomat based in
Washington. ``So the US administration decided to focus on a
mechanism of supporting cities governed by the opposition. The oil
program should demonstrate to people that it really pays to support
these democratic parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic said that when the opposition returns to Serbia it will
tout the US administration's change in policy and also talk about
unspecified promises from US congressmen for new funds if a
democratic government replaces Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But Goran Svilanovic, one of the more promising young
politicians in the opposition, laughed when told that the group had
made advances in Washington. ``At least in the States we do well,''
he said, before being swept away for a meeting with National
Security Adviser Samuel R. Berger.

&HT;        AD SPOTS ASK FOR NASA FUNDING, CRITICIZE VICE PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Alex Canizares  
 &HT;    c.1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Nov.3 - A community task force aimed at protecting
Langley Research Center's aeronautics research has launched an ad
campaign to support funding NASA for airline safety work.
</P>
<P>
   The ads, which use a national poll showing almost 70 percent of
Americans want NASA to conduct more air safety research, also take
a jab at Vice President Al Gore. The ads are an attempt to make
NASA air safety research an issue for the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for NASA has called the ads a ``gross
distortion.''
</P>
<P>
   The NASA Langley Community Support Team -- made up of business
and community leaders in Virginia that benefit from Langley-- has
put out print and television ads suggesting Gore has not
accomplished much as chair of the White House Commission on
Aviation Safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time to invest in aeronautics research to reduce
environmental damage, overcrowding at airports and to solve safety
problems in bad weather,'' states the group's latest print ad.
</P>
<P>
   The new ads asserts that funding for airlines safety has been
cut, and gives the vice president's phone number.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell [Gore] to make sure NASA's aeronautics funding meets the
needs of the future,'' the print ad reads.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are annoyed with the status of air transportation
system,'' said Laszlo Associates spokesman Alexander Mauss. ``They
would consider that an issue on who they decide they should vote
[on].''
</P>
<P>
   The ads are also aimed at influencing the president's Office of
Management and Budget, which is discussing the 2001 federal budget,
Mauss said.
</P>
<P>
   NASA spokeswoman Peggy Wilhide called the ad campaign ``a gross
distortion'' of Gore's record.
</P>
<P>
   After the White House formed the air safety task force in 1998,
Wilhide said, NASA's aeronautics funding was increased by $542
million from $313 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else do they want?,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The group's ads refer to a poll, conducted in early September by
Virginia-based pollsters Frank Luntz and Jennifer Laszlo, which
reflects strong public support for more NASA spending for
aeronautics.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-one percent of 800 likely voters surveyed in the poll
agreed to varying degrees that ``It is essential that America
develop technology to improve air traffic safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-Seven percent of those surveyed agreed that NASA should
``keep the balance between space exploration and improvements in
air safety research.''

TELEVISION IS KNEE DEEP IN SAP, AND WE LOVE IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing illustrates better that we are in the midst of a booming
economy and becoming fatter and happier than the fact television
has gone completely soft.
</P>
<P>
   We're knee deep in sap and apparently loving it.
</P>
<P>
   Television can be an excellent barometer of the country's mood.
Are shows socially relevant (''All In the Family,'' ``Maude,'' the
coming-out arc on ``Ellen'')?
</P>
<P>
   Is the industry trying to shelter us from reality by giving us
cheesy sitcoms (the entire late '70s)? Are we experiencing urban
angst, with gritty crime on our minds (''Hill Street Blues,''
``Homicide,'' ``NYPD Blue'')?
</P>
<P>
   Just watching the tube can reveal exactly how we're feeling.
</P>
<P>
   It's not scientific _ otherwise there would be long periods
where we were apparently mesmerized by Tony Danza's parenting
skills.
</P>
<P>
   But still, there's much to mine in the American psyche by
channel surfing.
</P>
<P>
   In the Microsoft market where there has been unbelievable
personal gain for much of the country _ and the front page of the
New York Times predicts it will continue into 2000 _ we have
virtually killed the sitcom genre (laughter works great when your
house is losing value, your job is nowhere and your investment
portfolio is bankrupt).
</P>
<P>
   More telling, we have abandoned irony and mean spiritedness.
</P>
<P>
   The casual flippancy of ``Seinfeld'' would probably tank if
introduced tomorrow. Who needs cynicism and boredom when there's
money to be made and every new day is a great day on Wall Street
and in Mister Roger's Neighborhood?
</P>
<P>
   Which is probably why the best sitcom of the year, the searingly
bitter and outrageously funny ``Action,'' has been ignored by all
but a few pockets of furrow-browed cynics and optimism-squelching
wet blankets.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, pundits say that the lead character is unlovable and that
the relentless focus on Hollywood is too insider-ish to really
understand.
</P>
<P>
   But since when did we not love the unlovable in this country?
Since when did we not like the black hat?
</P>
<P>
   And the last element of the argument is laughable. Thanks to the
onslaught of ``Entertainment Tonight'' and ``Entertainment Weekly''
and the myriad, ubiquitous clones of each, a housewife in Iowa
knows enough about celebrity gossip, back-end deals and residuals
to write a thesis.
</P>
<P>
   No, we're not watching ``Action'' or anything of that ilk
because we don't need comedy anymore. We need drama _ preferably
someone else's because, frankly, life is damn good for us _ and we
need cloying emotionalism and sugary endings.
</P>
<P>
   That's why ``Providence'' is a hit. That's why ``Judging Amy''
is a hit. And that's why ``Once and Again'' is a hit. Hell, that's
why the networks make relationship shows like ``Cold Feet,'' or
gauzy Capra-esque coming of age shows for the young ones like
``Time of Your Life.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC, knowing you want cuddles and romance, gave a stiff arm to
``NYPD Blue'' _ one of its best performers of the past _ and won't
let that downer rear its gritty head until January. Can you believe
that?
</P>
<P>
   And Fox just kicked Chris Carter rudely in the groin, canceling
his new ``Harsh Realm'' series. You know why the network felt so
bold? Because it knows this is the last season of ``The X-Files'' _
who wants to hear about government conspiracies and aliens these
days? _ and that you'll have no part of any harsh realm, factual or
fictional.
</P>
<P>
   As a country of TV viewers, we're just one big teddy bear. A
well-fed infant in a Baby Gap world.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not a good trend. We should all be uncomfortable
being this, well, comfortable. Friends are dating friends on
``Friends'' _ and that's just wrong.
</P>
<P>
   What's next, the wonderfully nasty sitcom ``Will &AMP; Grace'' cuts
the sharp barbs and has Will marry Grace in sweeps?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this shift has been coming for a while. Back in the day
there was Archie Bunker, and more recently Al Bundy. Fast forward
through the mindless era and the cop era and the short-lived
blue-collar ``Roseanne'' period and stop at ``Party of Five.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it could be conveniently swept under the Planet Teen rug _
just another trend (dying at its apex this season) where young
people dominated.
</P>
<P>
   But people watched ``Party of Five'' and then ``Dawson's Creek''
because, in the midst of sitcom-heavy network line-ups, adult fare
of the serious kind had vanished in some anti-''thirtysomething''
industry whitewash. But people glommed onto the angst of those
shows, and then the slightly older version of it that appeared in
last season's ``Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   As suddenly as action shows going the way of the dinosaur and
``Seinfeld'' opting for retirement, we were in a new age of talky
navel-gazing. We had some problems. But life got better real quick.
</P>
<P>
   And in our new technological society when 24-year-old skate rats
are outbidding people on really pricey houses, maybe we got tired
of youth, lost our enthusiasm for their well being.
</P>
<P>
   In comes ``Providence'' and the adorable curly locks of Melina
Kanakaredes, out goes sharp objects and big dilemmas.
</P>
<P>
   Really, it seemed to happen that quickly. Again, this isn't
scientific but one day we all ended up wrapped in Pottery Barn
cashmere throws by the fire, wiping our eyes as Mike Farrell helped
puppies live another day.
</P>
<P>
   Did anyone see this coming? Is anybody afraid?
</P>
<P>
   We are soft. Emotionally flabby. We want our TV shows to feel
like comfy fleece. Hey, we even tossed over cheesy reality shows _
animals attacking, cops crashing, neighbors thwacking themselves in
the groin, all caught on tape _ for game shows.
</P>
<P>
   Of course we all want to be millionaires. It seems like every
other person is halfway there already.
</P>
<P>
   Game shows. This is our nadir. And when they are not on, we're
watching reruns of ``Providence'' and then catching Amy Brenemman
(she too has adorable hair and looks vaguely and comfortingly like
Kanakaredes), who also has moved back to her small town and in with
a parent. This back to the womb thing is big, apparently _ from
boomers to boomerangs.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is going home for a hug and some comfort food. It feels
good to share with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once and Again'' struck a nerve because even in high times
it's hard to keep a family together and isn't it nice to see two
lovely people whose marriages just didn't work out have loads of
fortysomething sex?
</P>
<P>
   ``Once and Again'' assures dads who drive sport utility vehicles
and harried soccer moms that no, your life isn't over, and we not
only feel your pain, we watch it every week.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, Peter Dragon, the fictional lead character of
``Action'' _ which Fox pulled for the entire November sweeps _
stands abandoned, a reminder of when we were a harder people, when
we held grudges and laughed at the misfortune of others.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody give Peter a hug _ and maybe the ratings for ``Action''
will rise.

 &HT;    BUSH SEES 'A CONTEST' WITH McCAIN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE
 &HT;    By JENA HEATH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEREDITH, N.H. _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said Wednesday
that he faces ``a formidable candidate'' in Sen. John McCain, but
bristled at suggestions that he hasn't been working hard enough in
the state that holds the nation's first primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was finishing his eighth visit to New Hampshire, fewer than
most of the other presidential candidates. He gave his standard
campaign speech to a breakfast audience at the the Laconia Chamber
of Commerce and took questions.
</P>
<P>
   Later, speaking with reporters, a clearly annoyed Bush said he
stood by his decision to skip a recent GOP forum in New Hampshire
in order to be with his wife, Laura, when she received an award in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to apologize for anything,'' Bush said. ``I made
the right choice as far as I'm concerned and that's what matters.
That's what matters. People can accept that explanation or not.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that voters in New Hampshire seemed satisfied with his
decision, citing ``the number of people who've walked up to me on
this trip and said, 'I appreciate your standing by your wife's side
a lot.' ``
</P>
<P>
   ``People can accept me for who I am,'' Bush said. ``I hope they
do. But if they thought my decision was not the right decision, to
stand by my wife, there are other candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was clearly aware throughout the visit that he needs to
court this state's fiercely independent voters. With less than
three months before the Feb. 1 primary, McCain has been narrowing
Bush's lead in recent polls here.
</P>
<P>
   ``'I'm not surprised,'' Bush said about McCain's rise. ``He's a
good fellow and he's a good man and he's a formidable candidate. I
suspected there was going to be a contest in this state. There
always is in New Hampshire politics. And I welcome a good
discussion of the issues.''
</P>

   PARADIP, India _ Dead bodies, some washed up from the bay like
driftwood, others bobbing like corks in the river, have become so
plentiful in this port city that the authorities simply collect
what they can and lay them out in tight bunches on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   There are vague plans for a mass cremation, but Wednesday, with
most of the corpses already five days old, only the dogs and crows
and buzzards were busy with disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday one of the mightiest cyclones in India's history
chose Paradip as its first port of call. The storm would have been
demon enough if it had merely flaunted its 160 mph winds and then
gone on its way. But the cyclone lingered here, punishing this
small city of 80,000 people for 36 hours. The tidal surge _ 3 to 5
feet high _ lasted nearly a day.
</P>
<P>
   To be in Paradip is to see the world turned upside down, with
the bizarre and awful reality of it now flooding over its people
the way the water did earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of bridges have been blown away and are stuck like spears
into houses. The winds have plucked off slabs of concrete and left
the sidewalks gap-toothed. Some of the city's dead have been
discovered 20 miles away, carried off in the raging cascades to a
town called Kujang.
</P>
<P>
   G.K. Das, the deputy inspector general of police, keeps a
running total of Paradip's body count. Wednesday, the number was up
to 145, with 53 yet to be identified. ``We take snapshots so we can
show them around,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The cyclone churned across the Bay of Bengal and hit the
populous coast of the state of Orissa.
</P>
<P>
   State officials have been estimating that 3,000 people have
died, but they freely admit that this is guesswork, an amiably
repeated answer to a frequently repeated question. Thousands of
places remain cut off from contact, the long walks to a paved road
having become long swims.
</P>
<P>
   To his knowledge, Amar Maharana said, no one has counted the
deaths of his wife and four of his six children. To his knowledge,
no one has found the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw with my own eyes how they were taken away by the
water,'' said Maharana, 50, whose livelihood comes from carrying
freight on a rickshaw. ``I searched for three days. I gave up. They
are gone forever.''
</P>
<P>
   He lives in Sanduahud, a squatter colony in Paradip, on the
beach not far from where the bodies are being taken. The night
before the storm, police officers with megaphones walked among the
houses made of thatch and warned people to take shelter in nearby
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Maharana was among the many who spurned the advice. In years
past, other alerts proved unnecessary, and the storm warnings
became like the boy crying wolf.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water hit us with such a rush and swept us all away,'' he
said, stroking the fringe of beard that frames his face. ``I
grabbed on to a chunk of road, and my two oldest children grabbed
on to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Wanting to be helpful, the surviving son, Babu, age 12,
volunteered the names of his dead brothers and sisters: Bapi, 10;
Juli, 8; Mantu, 3; and Mili, 4 months.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Another man, Baneshwar Behra, 35, was summoned by a crowd that
had gathered. His story was the same, except that he is left with
no surviving children. He, too, has looked for the bodies of his
four children and believes that he once saw the boy Sarveshwar, 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was drifting by in a canal,'' Behra said, ``but when I
tried to get hold of the body, the water took him further and
further away, and then he was beyond my sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in Sanduahud were eager to be tour guides of the tragedy.
Kambala Vishwanath, 23, pointed out piles of brick rubble, evidence
that the storm had packed as much punch as artillery fire.
</P>
<P>
   He led a macabre excursion toward the bay, where the sands were
spotted with dozens of carcasses, mostly cows and water buffalo,
but also a few dead people the police had yet to find. ``Inside
this bundle is a baby,'' he said, showing a little mound covered
with a maroon cloth. ``And that woman there, I think she was
pregnant.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Gopal Mandal lives in the shantytown known as Tapovan. From the
wreckage of his house he can easily watch the Atarah Banki River.
He saw 15 bodies bobbing toward the sea on Tuesday and two more by
noon Wednesday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tapovan lost two of its own to the cyclone, Mandal said. ``The
wind blew down the houses, and the rain was so hard it hurt your
body like stones,'' he said. ``We all ran for the higher ground by
the railroad, and we knelt for hours and hours, clutching the
rails. One woman let go, and she and her baby were shoved by the
wind into the water.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As he talked, Mandal walked up the riverbank to the road, where
he has built a lean-to of branches and plastic for his family. The
only thing they have to eat is corn meal, which they mix with
contaminated river water even though they know it will make them
sick. His two infant sons had diarrhea. They were naked and
tearful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would it be better for them to starve and die?'' the weary man
asked.

   Government relief efforts in Orissa have gained speed only in
the last few days. Earlier, the army had yet to clear the main
highways of trees. Air force helicopters could not fly in the
buffeting winds. Navy ships were kept from the channels by debris.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though the Indian military appears to be fully mobilized,
it will be very hard to catch up with the head start that has been
given to disease and hunger. Along the roads, refugees run
frantically toward any handout. One after another, they make the
familiar gesture for begging, their fingers first going to their
mouths, then their palms reaching out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is air-dropping food, but I don't think they
have enough capacity,'' said Julian Francis of the International
Committee of the Red Cross. ``You can't air-drop food into 3 &UR;  &LR; feet
of water.''
</P>
<P>
   Jadupur is typical of villages cut off by the floods. It is a
long walk from a road and then a wade through hip-high water. The
helicopters have hovered overhead but failed to leave any packages.
``We climb our trees and get by with coconuts,'' said Vijay
Chaudhary.
</P>
<P>
   But Indians are resilient, and some of that comes from their
poverty. Many people had next to nothing to begin with, so the loss
of everything was a short step down. As quickly as some of their
homes went down, they were rebuilt. People with axes are
everywhere, collecting wood, drying jute, assembling thatch.
</P>
<P>
   Others, more desperate, have looted. In Sanduahud most stores
are closed, their contents emptied by hungry people who helped
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Babaji Sahu, a storekeeper, showed how a mob had entered his
small grocery through a damaged wall. ``I fought, but I could not
stop them,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Others interrupted him as he complained, feeling their troubles
greater, their complaints more worthy. One woman, Sirlul Kamamma,
made the beseeching gesture of the beggar and then pointed to her
home, its roof collapsed and its door wedged shut.
</P>
<P>
   She had been able to salvage only a few of her most precious
things, and they were spread out now on mounds of straw. One was a
black umbrella, another some water-stained reading texts for
children.
</P>
<P>
   But the dearest possession of all was a small painting of Lord
Krishna, there in his legendary glory, dressed in gold finery and
reclining on the wide coils of a sea snake.
</P>
<P>
   The serpent's hood shielded Krishna from a storm, just as the
Lord himself protected those below from the raging tempests loosed
in their mortal midst.

RAYTHEON SALE OF BAY STATE UNIT BRINGS CRITICISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Raytheon Co. has agreed to sell its microelectronics
unit to a New York components maker, a deal that will lead to the
closure of a big facility in Quincy and the layoff of most of its
400 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The move brought Raytheon swift criticism Wednesday from some
labor and political leaders, who said the Lexington defense
contractor isn't meeting the spirit of a controversial 1995 tax-cut
agreement meant to save jobs in the state.
</P>
<P>
   But Raytheon said the unit is no longer commercially viable, and
in recent months made no secret of its search for a buyer. Raytheon
said it expects between 250 to 300 workers will lose their jobs
within a year as the business and its machinery is transfered to
privately-held Imrex LLC of Great Neck, NY.
</P>
<P>
   The closure comes as a blow to Quincy, where the facility has
been a key employer for decades. ``They kept us informed they might
sell it, so it came as no shock, but everybody took it that way
when they told us,'' said Kathleen Quinn, a parts assembler who has
worked at the plant for 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   Imrex isn't buying Raytheon's two large buildings in Quincy,
which remain for sale. Financial terms of the agreement weren't
disclosed. In an interview Wednesday Imrex president Harry A. Armon
declined to discuss whether the company planned to offer jobs or
relocation packages to former Raytheon workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Quincy facility has produced parts like hybrid computer
chips that process both analog and digital signals for weapons
systems. Raytheon decided to sell the plant ``because of a lack of
demand for these components,'' said Raytheon spokesman David Polk.
The facility was operating at less than forty percent of its
capacity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The closure comes as the most recent strategic move by Raytheon,
whose shares fell sharply last month after it disclosed poor
profitability at its defense units. Raytheon wouldn't specify the
cost of severance payments related to its actions in Quincy but
said those payments have already been accounted for in its previous
announcement that it would take a charge against earnigns of $599
million this year.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders, who held a big rally in June to try to save the
Quincy operation, expressed anger at its closure. They said they
had been told that the facility was ``meeting its quotas and
projections,'' according to Mike Zagami, head of the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers local that represents most of the
plants employees and other blue-collar workers, chiefly at
Raytheon's big missile-assembly facilities in Andover.
</P>
<P>
   But Zagami conceded there was little the union could do to block
the deal or save the jobs, and said it would now focus on enforcing
seniority rights for some of the Quincy plant's older employees.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the closure demonstrates the changing role of
Raytheon as the state's third-largest private employer, Zagazmi
said. While the IBEW in 1991 represented more than 10,000 hourly
employees, after the Quincy closure is complete by the end of this
year the union will represent only around 3,000 workers., primarily
in Andover.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Raytheon's total employment in Massachusetts will
hold steady this year at around 13,700 as the company continues to
hire white-collar managers and engineers. At one point in 1995,
Raytheon employed 19,500 in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to stem the decline of blue-collar jobs, labor leaders
four years ago helped Raytheon obtain certain tax breaks in return
for agreements to meet certain payroll levels in the state. While
Raytheon has met those targets, its continuing shift of
manufacturing work to low-cost facilities in Tucson, Ariz. and
elsewhere has angered its onetime allies.
</P>
<P>
   Now figures like Robert Haynes, president of the Massachusetts
AFL-CIO, back proposed legislation to tie future tax breaks to the
preservation of existing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raytheon must be held accountable for the injustices it has
committed,'' he said Wednesday. ``I am very disappointed by
Raytheon's announcement,'' said US Senator Edward Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   State Senator Susan Fargo, lead sponsor of legislation to change
the tax rules, said she hoped the closure would galvanize support
from key figures like Senate President Thomas Birmingham, who
couldn't be reached for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The work force at the Quincy plant has dwindled steadily in
recent years and Raytheon says fewer than 400 people work there
today. One unit still for sale produces cathode-ray tubes and
employees about 30 people, said Raythoen's Polk. A second unit with
about 65 people will be moved to Andover to continue production of
an accoustic-wave detection device used in certain missiles and
radar assemblies.

COMMENTARY: `DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCES' 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In Oslo the other day, the ex-KGB man who is
Russia's prime minister of the month delivered a letter from
President Yeltsin to President Clinton:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Bill,'' I am told it began, ``I would like to share with
you, in confidence and with the utmost candor'' _ and then a
Kremlin spokesman put out, in less confidence, the guts of the
letter: that if the U.S. proceeded to mount any defense of its
territory against nuclear missiles, ``it would have extremely
dangerous consequences for the entire arms control process.''
</P>
<P>
   That threat _ signed ``Respectfully, B. Yeltsin'' _ puts Clinton
in a bind. He is acutely aware of the dilemma that is likely to
face his successor:
</P>
<P>
   A rogue state invades its neighbor, threatening some vital U.S.
interest. The U.S. president mobilizes a strike force to stop the
aggression. The dictator responds with a threat to fire a nuclear
missile at New York.
</P>
<P>
   That U.S. president turns to the director of central
intelligence, who says: ``We suspect that state may have an
untested nuclear device. We know that it has a stolen
intercontinental missile. The odds are 50-50 that he is bluffing.
Of course, because we adhere to the 1972 Antiballistic Missile
Treaty, we have no defense against such an incoming missile.''
</P>
<P>
   What do you decide, Mr. President? Do you call the possible
bluff, resolutely defending our interests abroad at the risk of
losing an American city? Or do you prudently back down, blaming
Bill Clinton for his legacy of leaving this country naked to its
new enemies?
</P>
<P>
   This is not a novel or a movie plot. As states like Iraq, Iran,
Sudan and North Korea develop the technology of terror, and as
well-financed terrorist organizations buy the components of nuclear
missiles, that agonizing choice is more likely than not to face our
president _ unless we start now to deploy a defense that can shoot
down a score or two of incoming missiles. That would counter the
threat before it materializes.
</P>
<P>
   Why do Yeltsin's manipulators pretend to see this as a strategic
threat to their thousands of missiles? Why are they enlisting China
and the United Nations in a campaign to deny the United States this
rudimentary protection from rogue states? Why do they
ostentatiously test their SS-19s and antimissile missiles,
threatening an end to strategic arms control if we build a tactical
umbrella for a nuclear-rainy day?
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the Yeltsin position seems irrational. The
Russians know a defense against individual missiles would not
challenge their nuclear superpower status. They know that the
development of missiles that kill missiles _ which they could steal
from or wheedle out of us _ would protect them from a growing
threat from Iran's Islamic fundamentalists on their border and in
Chechnya. Then why their fuss?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: It's their main leverage on us. Using our outdated
treaty with a USSR that no longer exists, Russia will extort the
highest price it can in economic and military aid for graciously
granting America permission to defend itself against rogue-state
missiles. By posing ABM as a matter of principle, B. Yeltsin will
respectfully hold us up for all he can.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's approach is to buy the Russians off with economic aid
and improvements on their radar. He sees John McCain making our
nuclear nakedness a campaign issue, and George W. Bush will deal
with it in his Nov. 19 foreign policy address at the Reagan
Library.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Clinton will weigh the state of our antimissile
technology, the budget-busting cost of a limited system, the
growing threat from rogue states and the attitude of allies like
Japan toward theater defenses. Then I'll bet he will offend the
Democratic left with a decision in early summer to deploy a limited
system _ just in time to strike a tough pose for the political
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-liners here are having none of this time-consuming,
unnecessary and expensive negotiation. President Nixon made sure
the ABM treaty had a withdrawal clause. If we now tried to buy
minor alterations to the old treaty, we would undercut our ability
to soon build an effective land- and sea-based, space-monitored
defense.
</P>
<P>
   This is no time for dancing with bears. Too many American lives
are at stake. We need National Missile Defense now.

COLOMBIAN REBELS ADD JOURNALISTS TO LIST OF POSSIBLE HOSTAGES
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ As the focus of Colombia's civil conflict
shifts from the battlefield to the negotiating table, left-wing
guerrillas are withdrawing the immunity they once granted to the
press and have begun kidnapping journalists attempting to cover
their activities.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent episode, a unit of the the country's largest
rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known by
the Spanish-language acronym FARC, on Oct. 29 abducted a newspaper
reporter and news crews from the country's two main television
networks as they were on their way to cover a clash between the
insurgents and the army.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels demanded publication of a manifesto as a condition
for the release of the seven hostages, but freed them late Tuesday
after widespread protests.
</P>
<P>
   That abduction came two days after Henry Romero, a photographer
working for the Reuters news agency, was kidnapped by another rebel
group, the National Liberation Army, or ELN.
</P>
<P>
   Romero was seized after accepting the group's invitation to
attend a news conference near Cali, which was called because the
rebels were meeting with relatives of some of the 160 people they
kidnapped from a church on May 30.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the ELN accused Romero of ``abusing our goodwill
and confidence'' by taking ``clandestine images of our faces,''
which they said were later sold to intelligence agencies. Reuters
issued a statement in London defending Romero's ``professional
integrity'' and urging his ``immediate release,'' but the
insurgents are threatening to put him on trial.
</P>
<P>
   Even before last week's incidents, the Committee to Protect
Journalists, a New York-based human rights group, regarded Colombia
as one of the most dangerous places in the world for reporters.
Since 1989, 46 journalists have been assassinated here, including
three recently.
</P>
<P>
   But most of those killings have been attributed to drug cartels
seeking to discourage investigations into their trafficking
activities and financial holdings. While guerrilla groups have
occasionally ``detained'' reporters in the past, it has usually
been for a brief period, and then primarily in order to give them
messages or manifestoes to be delivered to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the stakes are higher than ever before for the
guerrillas. In order to jump-start peace talks, which formally
began Oct. 24 after nearly a year of preliminaries, the government
has granted the FARC control of a large ``demilitarized zone,''
where the Colombian press has documented numerous human rights
abuses by the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past six months or so, as the peace negotiations have
been getting under way, there has been a worrisome escalation in
attacks on press freedom,'' said Marylene Smeets, Latin America
coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists. ``It has to
do with the fact that the parties sitting down at the negotiating
table want to have their point of view heard as much as possible
and are willing to force journalists to hear that point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Jimena Duzan, a columnist for the Bogota daily El
Espectador, said of the rebels: ``They feel that if they have been
able to wring all these concessions from the government, why not
try to do the same with the media.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Colombian press, covering the war has become
increasingly difficult. Television networks recently decided to
stop broadcasting combat scenes in color in order to play down the
violence, and this week 21 newspapers and radio and television
stations are to sign an agreement on coverage guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Duzan argues that those measures are not enough. ``It is
time for the Colombian media to respond, as we did to the narcotics
traffickers,'' she said. ``We should not publish any manifesto
under duress, because to do so would make hostages of all of us
from here on in.''

FAMILIES CHAGRINED BY LACK OF QUICK RECOVERY EFFORT

   NEWPORT, R.I. _ Stunned and grief-stricken, they traveled
halfway across the world for answers to the deaths of their loved
ones, expecting that if anyone could deliver, it would be America.
</P>
<P>
   Days after EgyptAir 990 crashed off Nantucket, killing 217,
relatives of the Egyptian victims believed that, with their wealth
of technology and vast resources, U.S. officials would quickly
solve the mystery of the tragedy and send them home to heal.
</P>
<P>
   But days have passed with few expectations fulfilled, and
Wednesday, National Transportation Safety Board leaders tried to
explain the cruel reality: even the best technology in the world is
no match for the power of nature.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery of the wrecked jet and the remains of its
passengers has stalled in the face of rough seas, high winds, and
waters so deep that highly-trained divers are cautious of venturing
in. As of Wednesday, the Coast Guard had pulled all but one of its
salvage vessels to shore, saying the ships were also low on food,
fuel and water.
</P>
<P>
   And because the impact shattered most of the bodies, families
will be told Thursday whether they will receive an official death
certificate or merely a statement that their loved one is
``presumed dead.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the most logical explanations are hard for some
Egyptian families to accept or understand _ particularly those who
still believe in America's invincibility.
</P>
<P>
   During a routine briefing, some lashed out at the NTSB, blaming
the delays on laziness or lack of caring.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamad Yehya, a Brooklyn resident whose cousin died in the
crash, said Egyptians believed that the American military could
withstand conditions of any sort, water of any depth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so easy for them _ 270 feet? It's nothing for them,'' he
said. ``All this technology? They can't find anything from the
plane?''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with experience in airplane crash recovery say such
frustration is a common reaction among grieving families _ emotions
that have been exacerbated by disorganized relief efforts, such as
the one that followed the crash of TWA flight 800 off the coast of
New York three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But with the 1996 Aviation Disaster Family Act, Congress moved
to improve the process of informing and consoling relatives,
establishing rules to make air crash investigations a more orderly,
compassionate affair.
</P>
<P>
   By many accounts, the law _ which names the Red Cross as the
sole grief organizer _ has worked.
</P>
<P>
   Officials and some victims' relatives say the scene at the Goat
Island Doubletree Hotel this week is well-run and structured:
families feel comfortable at the hotel, and are being counseled and
treated with dignity.
</P>
<P>
   But Egyptian families are still distraught, upset by their own
high expectations, and worried about the passage of time. And they
say that at the briefing, their frustration finally bubbled over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meeting was only speeches. Only talking,'' said Mohamed
Sultan, an Egyptian native who lives in Torrance, Calif., and whose
34-year-old daughter, Riham, died in the crash. ``If you delay, it
will get worse and worse and worse.''
</P>
<P>
   NTSB chairman James E. Hall said it's not unsual for grieving
families to vent their anger on the people in charge. But he said
investigators and salvage crews are working endless hours in
difficult conditions to find out what could have gone wrong that
night.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from the crash site, Coast Guard searchers have been
working in shifts on rafts, pulling bits of debris from the water,
officers said. The seas are rough, twice as deep as they were
during the TWA recovery. The odor of jet fuel is so strong that
crews wear surgical masks.
</P>
<P>
   And when waves rise to levels near 20 feet _ as they did on
Tuesday and Wednesday, when a storm moved toward the coast _ the
conditions become far worse, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a terrible place to be,'' said Commander John McCann,
captain of the Coast Guard cutter Reliance, which was part of the
salvage effort.
</P>
<P>
   The open-ended recovery effort has frustrated officers who are
trained to save lives, Coast Guard spokesman Glen Maestas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really different for us,'' he said. ``We all joined
the Coast Guard to come back with survivors, and we're not able to
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, officials say that when only a trickle of information is
available, it's hard to convince grieving families that the
recovery teams are committed to their task.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so hard to find anything out. It's so slow,'' said Gary
Miller, head of Red Cross operations at Goat Island Doubletree
hotel where relatives are staying. ``There's nothing to say to the
families. Sometimes they feel that they're not being told anything.
As the week drags on, there will be more and more frustration.''

 &HT;    `Enquirer' owner buys `Globe' to capture market
 &HT;    By Stephanie Smith
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANTANA, Fla. _ Boca Raton, known for its pink faux Spanish
architecture and highbrow shopping centers, now will have the
distinction of tabloid capital of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The National Enquirer's owner, American Media, on Tuesday
cornered the market on checkout counter tabloids by buying Boca
Raton-based Globe Communications for $105 million in cash, and will
move The Enquirer from Lantana.
</P>
<P>
   American Media now owns nearly every supermarket tabloid widely
available in the United States. The company's roster not only
includes The Enquirer, Star and Weekly World News, but now the
Globe, National Examiner and Sun. Only the Tarrytown, N.Y.-based
Star will be headquartered outside of Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   The combined publications are expected to pull $400 million in
revenue a year, American Media Chief Executive David Pecker said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Globe Communications made $108 million in revenue last year,
with a third coming from its Mini Mags, booklets such as ``What
Sign is Your Pet?'' and ``Restless? Confused? Irritable?
Stressed?'' sold at checkout counters. Michael Rosenbloom, the
Canadian who has owned Globe Communications for nearly 50 years,
will retain New York-based Bridal Guide magazine, which is
family-run.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's main asset is the Globe, which went from a
steady circulation of 1.2 million a week to 750,000 in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe, run by British-born editor Tony Frost, and the
Enquirer, headed by Ivy League American Steve Coz, have been
enemies for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking over at American Media in May, Pecker said he was
amazed at tabloid rivalry, even within the same company. Pecker
became chief executive after N.Y.-based Evercore Partners bought
American Media for $850 million. Evercore is headed by former U.S.
Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though they've been under the same ownership for years,
there was that blood sport between The Enquirer and Star,'' Pecker
said. Only recently have the editors of the two tabs begun speaking
to each other to share information, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The battle has been even fiercer between The Enquirer and the
Globe, which this year went to court over allegations of dirty
dealings in the adultery scandal involving sports announcer Frank
Gifford.
</P>
<P>
   Coz even attacked the Globe's journalistic ethics in the
editorial pages of The New York Times, saying his competitor paid a
woman to have sex with Gifford.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 500 full-time employees of the two will share the same
63,000-square-foot building at the Arvida Park of Commerce in Boca
Raton. On Tuesday, planners were trying to figure out how to
separate and enlarge the building's parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be a big plus,'' Pecker said. ``I'm trying to
build one competitive spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Pecker said the editorial staffs of the rivals will remain
separate and intact, but did not rule out consolidation of ``back
office'' operations. Pecker was scheduled to meet with Globe
employees Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   One area of obvious duplication is the merchandising division,
he said. The Enquirer has 1,700 part-time workers and the Globe 500
part-time workers nationwide who check supermarkets and other
stores to make sure the magazines are properly placed. He also will
move Cracked and The Detective Series magazines from New York to
Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, the top three tabloids _ The Enquirer, Star and Globe
_ will have a weekly circulation of about 5 million, but it's still
a far cry from the heydays when The Enquirer alone hit that number.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really down to the hard-core audience,'' Pecker said.
</P>
<P>
   The tabloids lost readers to gossip television shows and in the
wave of general disgust with the stalking paparazzi tactics that
followed Princess Diana's death.
</P>
<P>
   American Media already has spent more than $50 million in
advertising and makeovers to clean up and sharpen the images of The
Enquirer and Star.
</P>
<P>
   Pecker said he wants each of the weeklies to have a separate
identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a Hollywood scandal, The Enquirer would be
investigative and the Star would cover the career aspects and the
Globe would really provide the unvarnished gossip, the spicy and
the controversial,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Myers, a New York-based media researcher, said the
consolidation could attract new advertisers to the tabloids that
want a sizable market of mostly women, but can't afford more
mainstream women's and fashion magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clean up their act a little and pull in the national
packaged-good advertisers,'' Myers said. ``It's kind of like taking
an X-rated movie and taking it to an R or a PG. You build your
audience size.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike mainstream publications, advertising makes up only 10
percent of tabloids' revenue with the bulk coming from newsstand
sales, Pecker said. That's a huge area for potential growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to package this,'' he said.

TREASURY PRICES RISE AMID INVESTOR OPTIMISM ON SHORT-TERM RATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Spurred by investor optimism that the Federal Reserve
will not have to raise short-term interest rates more than once in
the near future, prices of Treasury securities rose slightly
Wednesday after rebounding from early weakness.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 30-year bond rose 2/32, to 99 28/32;
its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.13
percent, from 6.14 percent Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Also supporting prices was the Treasury's announcement that it
will sell $15 billion of five-year notes next week and reopen its
August issue of 10-year notes, selling $10 billion more of the
existing securities at its quarterly auctions Tuesday and
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The refunding will not include the 30-year bond issue for the
first time since 1995 because budget surpluses have reduced the
government's borrowing needs. It will be less than the $27 billion
expected.
</P>
<P>
   According to some analysts, the reduced supply of government
securities will help bonds, with investors buying on favorable data
or optimistic comments from Fed officials. In when-issued trading
ahead of next week's sales, the five-year notes were being offered
at a price to yield 5.90 percent, while the current 10-year issue
was trading at a price to yield 6.02 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gains were limited as market participants kept buying to a
minimum ahead of Friday's scheduled report on employment in
October, a closely watched survey that often moves the market.
</P>
<P>
   Another quarter-percentage-point increase in short-term interest
rates is a distinct possibility at the Fed's policy-making meeting
Nov. 16, said Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Asset
Management. But, he added, ``the lack of clear-cut inflationary
pressures in the midst of an economic boom will undoubtedly
engender lively discussion at the Fed forum, which makes this next
decision a very close call.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, economic data scheduled for release between now and
the meeting, particularly Friday's labor market data, will take on
even more significance than usual,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The ``beige book'' report of business activity among the Fed's
12 districts, which was released Wednesday, was seen as somewhat
more bearish than expected, with several districts reporting
accelerated wage gains. ``In most districts, the persistent
tightness in labor markets continues to put upward pressure on wage
increases,'' the report said. But it went on to state that ``there
are few signs of a general pickup in prices of final goods and
services.''
</P>
<P>
   The economic data released Wednesday was slightly softer than
expected but in no way implied a weakening economy. Led by new
orders for durable goods, total factory orders dropped 0.9 percent
during September, and new orders, along with building permits, were
instrumental in producing the 0.1 percent decline in the September
index of leading economic indicators.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the National Association of Securities Dealers said
it had submitted a proposal to the Securities and Exchange
Commission seeking approval for a new system intended to make it
easier to find current price quotes for corporate debt. If
approved, NASD members would begin reporting all over-the-counter
transactions involving eligible corporate bonds next spring. &QL;

U.N. OFFICIAL SAYS TALIBAN RESISTING OPENING SUPPLY ROUTE FOR
REFUGEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Thousands of refugees face disaster this winter
unless Afghanistan's battling factions allow the creation of a safe
corridor within the next few weeks to deliver food, fuel and
shelter supplies to the country's north, the U.N. relief
coordinator for Afghanistan said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Eric De Mul, said that reaching 65,000 Afghans in
the isolated Panjshir Valley who were displaced by fighting on the
Shomali plain north of the capital, Kabul, has become a priority
for aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been negotiating with both sides, discussing access
across the front lines,'' De Mul said at a news briefing. ``So far
we haven't been successful.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that the Taliban, the Islamic militia movement
that controls 90 percent of the country, has been unwilling to open
a route, contending that it is too dangerous. The Taliban is
fighting a coalition of forces entrenched in the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   The World Food Program has delivered 786 tons of wheat and flour
to the valley and needs to transport at least 3,300 more tons
before the end of November, when snow blocks the roads. Only two
mountain passes, at Anjuman and Khowah, are open and they close
completely in winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still hopeful that it will happen,'' De Mul said. ``If
not, we will have a fairly serious disaster on our hands in
December.''
</P>
<P>
   The valley's 145,000 permanent residents have too few resources
to share with the displaced arrivals, who were reduced to picking
the latest crop of vegetables, fruit and corn before it was ripe.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations estimates that more than 230,000 people have
been displaced by three military offensives this year, and that
they all will need emergency food and assistance with shelter
during the winter.
</P>
<P>
   The offensives were accompanied by what a U.N. report calls
``serious human rights violations,'' including a scorched earth
policy of summary executions, forced displacements, abduction of
women and the separation of men from their families.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers reported that the Taliban has recruited refugee men
to fight by promising to feed and shelter their families.
</P>
<P>
   Afghanistan has been wracked by war since the Soviet Union
invaded the country 20 years ago to prop up a pro-Moscow
government. Afghan guerrilla fighters turned on each other after
the Russians left.
</P>
<P>
   Between 540,000 and 1 million Afghans were displaced internally
in 1998, according to the U.S. Committee for Refugees, a nonprofit
organization that tracks the plight of refugees around the world.
More than 2.6 million Afghans have taken refuge in neighboring
countries. And in Kabul, an estimated 600,000 Afghans in Kabul rely
on foreign aid to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The population of Kabul is put at 1.1 million residents, but aid
workers think the actual number may be much higher because many
Kabul families support four or five displaced families in their
home.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, U.N. relief workers held talks for a week with
Taliban officials, who have imposed a radical Islamic regime on the
country. De Mul said that some progress had been made in letting
women go to work and school and get medical care. He described the
improvement as very low in percentage terms.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Oct. 15, the Security Council voted to freeze the Taliban's
assets overseas and curtail flights by the national airline unless
the Taliban surrendered the Saudi militant Osama bin Laden by next
Sunday. He is suspected of organizing the bombings of the U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban's foreign minister, Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, said
Wednesday in Kabul that bin Laden will never be handed over or
forced to leave Afghanistan, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the world has little leverage to exert.
Afghanistan's seat at the United Nations is still held by the
government in retreat. The Afghan airline flies only to the United
Arab Emirates. And the Taliban says it has no assets abroad.
</P>
<P>
   If sanctions are imposed, De Mul said that he did not expect
them to hurt the aid effort. ``We hope we can continue our
operations as usual,'' he said.

CHINA SEIZES DOCUMENTS FROM 5 WESTERN REPORTERS OVER SECT NEWS
CONFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The police called in at least five Western reporters
on Wednesday for questioning about a clandestine Falun Gong news
conference that they attended Oct. 28 and seized the reporters'
accreditation cards and residence permits.
</P>
<P>
   The officers said they were ``only temporarily'' confiscating
the documents. The reporters retained their passports and long-term
visas. But the officers refused to say when the documents would be
returned or what the reporters' status was in the interim.
</P>
<P>
   The residence permit is required of any foreigner living
long-term in China. The accreditation card is required to work as a
journalist.
</P>
<P>
   In separate sessions that lasted from one to two hours, officers
of the Public Security Bureau warned the reporters, who included
Erik Eckholm of The New York Times, that because Falun Gong was
banned in July, interviewing members of the spiritual movement is
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also sought information about the Chinese
participants in the news conference, who are quite likely to face
serious criminal charges if they are arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Times executive editor Joseph Lelyveld said of
Eckholm: ``Our correspondent was just doing his job. He was
reporting the news.''

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will field questions from the
public over the Internet for an hour and a half on Monday, Nov. 8,
using an advanced technology that will allow 50,000 people to see
and hear him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is looking forward to it,'' said White House
spokesman Barry Toiv. ``We want to continue to expand our use of
the extraordinary technology to communicate with the American
people and to allow the public to communicate with the president.''
</P>
<P>
   The event will not be a White House production but rather a
political one, organized by the Democratic Leadership Council, the
centrist organization that Clinton once led. The Internet service
Excite will provide the technology.
</P>
<P>
   With Excite's system, 15,000 people who log on to the site early
enough will have the opportunity, provided their computers have the
capacity, to see and hear the president, and they will be able to
submit questions to him by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 35,000 people who log on will be able to see and
hear Clinton but will not be able to submit questions. The session
will run from 7 to 8:30 p.m., although many people are likely to
try to gain access earlier. Similar interactive efforts in the
past, like one for Victoria's Secret lingerie, left many people
unable to participate.
</P>
<P>
   The site for the discussion is www.townhallmeeting.excite.com.
For those who want to read the text on the Democratic Leadership
Council's Web site, it is www.dlcppi.org.
</P>
<P>
   DLC spokesman Matt Frankel said Clinton would participate from a
university in Washington, both to take advantage of up-to-date
Internet services and to disassociate the White House from the
political nature of the event.
</P>
<P>
   A founder of Excite, Joe Kraus, has been a financial supporter
of Vice President Al Gore. But DLC vice president Holly Page said
Excite's participation was motivated by business, not politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excite saw it as a business project,'' Ms. Page said. By
providing the equipment, she added. Excite will be able to promote
its new technology.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising banners that normally accompany Internet pages
will be suspended while the president is online, Ms. Page added.
But the publicity generated by the event will be a great boon to
Excite.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Leadership Council will not make any direct
solicitations for money during the session, she said, but there
will be a link to the council's home page, where a viewer can make
a donation.
</P>
<P>
   Both that home page and Excite will provide a running text for
anyone who was not able to enter the Internet site on time.
</P>
<P>
   Other centrist Democrats are to participate in the online
question-and-answer session. They are New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne
Shaheen, Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Wisconsin
State Rep. Antonio Riley; San Jose, Calif., Mayor Ron Gonzales; and
Bethlehem, Pa., Mayor Don Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what would prevent a person from putting a rude question
to Clinton, DLC president Al From said, ``We'll be able to see the
questions before they're asked.''

 ANNIE LEIBOVITZ AIMS FOR THE '90s  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``That's nice, great,'' says the photographer to
Annie Leibovitz, as she poses in a chair. ``Like that profile.''
</P>
<P>
   She stretches out her lanky, 5-foot, 11 and 1/2-inch frame,
running her hand through her long, blond-streaked hair, her noble
nose aimed slightly to the side.
</P>
<P>
   It's always interesting to see what happens to Leibovitz when
she's the subject of a photograph. Although she will never come out
and totally manage the photo shoot, she usually wins.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tacit perk that, after 30 years of photographing
celebrities for m covers, she gets automatically.
</P>
<P>
   But once in a while, even a woman as accomplished and heralded
as Annie Leibovitz needs to extend herself.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing covering Bette Midler with rose petals or dipping
a nude Whoopi Goldberg in a bathtub full of milk, but it's another
to do a portrait of five female coal miners a half-mile down in a
mine shaft or three Latina gang members sitting on a stoop in San
Antonio, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Women,'' Leibovitz's newest book (Random House, $75), she
selected 123 of her pictures of American women, not all famous, not
all beautiful and, certainly, not all young.
</P>
<P>
   The genesis of the book came from Leibovitz's friend of long
standing, author Susan Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her I would consider doing this if she did the essay,''
Leibovitz says. 'It was a very scary prospect _ like going out to
photograph the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the photos were taken in the past three years for Vogue
and Vanity Fair. All of the pictures, however, had been shot after
1992, and that, says Leibovitz, ``is why they aren't dated. This
book is about women in the '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   Sontag's influence is evident beyond the introduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire Susan so much,'' says Leibovitz, who met Sontag
nearly 12 years ago when she was assigned to make a portrait of
Sontag. ``I wanted her to like the book. She didn't have much to do
with what I was shooting until the end when she helped me with a
few more names from her world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to smarten this up,'' Sontag told Leibovitz,
suggesting the addition of several academics, poets and artists,
including sculptor Louise Bourgeois.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, when Leibovitz is on a shoot, she travels with an
entourage _ an assistant or two, a stylist, hair and makeup people.
But some of the photographs in ``Women'' appear to be straight
journalism, shot with a minimum of preparation or fanfare _ far
more spontaneous than those elaborately plotted portraits Leibovitz
is known for.
</P>
<P>
   ``The project itself demanded a much less conceptual approach,''
says Leibovitz. ``In order to believe these women, it had to be
straightforward and honest.''
</P>
<P>
   But when a picture is good, she laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know it's good,'' says Leibovitz about the Bourgeois
photograph, which was more a product of happenstance than planning.
``I walked into her house and she was waiting for me. Old people
are like that. They're dressed and ready to go right on time. I
sent my assistant out in the back to set up and I had a Leica with
me and started shooting her in natural light. I asked her to take
her hair down and took some pictures. My assistant came back and
said they were ready and I said, ``I'm done. Let's go.' ``
</P>
<P>
   The camera is Leibovitz's paint brush, but she is always
``trying to forget about it. I'm always trying to transcend the
camera and get right into the picture.'' Hers then, is the art of
voyeurism. ``This may disappoint you,'' she says, ``but I don't
feel I learned anything new about women that I already didn't know.
This became less about gender and more about individuality. The
stories of these women were amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Leibovitz photographed five women coal miners in the Jim Walter
No. 5 Mine in Brookwood, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of those women said she worked down there for 20 years to
put four daughters through college. It was a privilege to
photograph them. All some of these women ever wanted was
recognition. Someone to notice and to acknowledge what they'd
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Other subjects were not strangers to the camera. For example,
former Texas Gov. Ann Richards, who was photographed kitted out in
khakis and toting a very expensive shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this picture is about is a story she told me,'' explains
Leibovitz. ``When she was first running for governor of Texas, her
polls were very low. On a duck hunt, she was photographed holding a
gun and her polls shot up _ presumably because it was a signal to
the men of Texas that she would not take away their guns. Once a
year after she was elected, she staged a photo op holding a gun.
She said to me, `Annie . . . I know how to use this.' She is so
special. She shoots from the hip.''
</P>
<P>
   What Leibovitz found so riveting about photographing younger
women, particularly hip-hop star Lil' Kim, the Latina homies and
even the Vegas show girls she shot both in and out of costume, is
``how women have always been looked at and now they are looking
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Tennis stars Serena and Venus Williams, whom
Leibovitz calls ``unbelievably in-your face. There is such attitude
in that picture. Contrast them to the photograph I took of Oceola
McCarty, the woman who worked for years cleaning other peoples'
houses and then gave thousands of dollars to a school. Oceola was a
whole other generation of African American woman, and Serena and
Venus are out to conquer the world. I photographed them for Vogue
and this picture is an out-take. I call it the f--- you picture _
as in, ``Just wait till we get you out on the tennis court. We'll
whip yo a--.' They are big, strong girls. Venus, in particular, is
unbelievable looking. She's taller than Serena.
</P>
<P>
   She's like an antelope.''

 &HT;    Fortune finds unsung hero in look
 &HT;    at century's business
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ James Casey was one of the unsung heroes of the
business world over the last century, according to Fortune. That's
one pronouncement from the magazine, which in its Nov. 22 issue
offers the ``best'' _ and ``worst'' of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Casey, by the way, founded a company called American Messenger
Co. It's known today as United Parcel Service.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Fortune: The much watched Warren Buffett holds forth his
view of the long-term outlook for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   FINDING BALANCE
</P>
<P>
   ``I sacrificed my family,'' entrepreneur James Lloyd confesses
to Inc. (November) in a cover story that details how one man is
learning to balance work and family. Lloyd says he realized ``that
either you get divorced and you keep your cruddy little business,
or you fix things.''
</P>
<P>
   Fixing things means doing things differently at home and at work
for Lloyd, founder of Versatile Systems, a software company in
Washington state. Among the lessons he passes along: delegate at
work and devote more time to family.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT MAKES PAUL ALLEN RUN?
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's vision is finally starting to
come into focus, according to Forbes (Nov. 15). Allen, who's about
to sell part of Charter Communications to the public, is really out
to serve ``the ultimate sofa spud,'' the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's investments once looked unconnected, but they now make
sense, Forbes says.

the weight of cars and boost mileage.

   BERLIN FALLOUT
</P>
<P>
   Has it been a decade since the Berlin Wall crumbled?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it has. And Business Week (Nov. 8) reminds readers in a
special report of the dramatic changes _ and remaining issues _ in
Europe. ``The driving forces are technology and business, rather
than ideology and geopolitics,'' the magazine notes in highlighting
the changes.
</P>
<P>
   For argument's sake
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard Business Review (November-December) weighs in on the
continuing debate over whether the current economy is really
different. William A. Sahlman argues it is, pointing to
technological changes as well as entrepreneurial problem-solving.

WEATHER INTERVENES IN SEARCH FOR FLIGHT 990 `BLACK BOXES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON AND CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ Frustrated searchers were kept in port Wednesday
as high winds created 20-foot swells on the Atlantic, keeping them
from recovering the ``black boxes'' of EgyptAir Flight 990, data
recording devices that could contain key information on the
mysterious crash.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive of Boeing Co., which built the 767
twin-engine jet that crashed Sunday morning 60 miles south of
Nantucket with 217 people on board, vigorously defended the
airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing Chief Executive Phil Condit said the 767 had suffered
only two fatal crashes in its 18-year history, with the exception
of one incident in which hijackers forced an Ethiopian plane to fly
until it ran out of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no plane that has a better safety record over that
length of time. Period,'' Condit said.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators continued to look at the plane's thrust
reversers, aviation experts noted that the radar track of Flight
990 does not indicate a malfunction brought down the airplane a
half hour after it left New York.
</P>
<P>
   John Hansman, a professor of aeronautics at MIT, said the radar
track shows the plane diving on a straight heading and accelerating
in speed, characteristics which are inconsistent with a deployment
of one thrust reverser.
</P>
<P>
   If one of the reversers had engaged, the plane would have yawed,
or spun sharply to that side and begun a nose dive in which the
plane would quickly become inverted.
</P>
<P>
   If both reversers had deployed _ and one was malfunctioning and
rendered inactive by EgyptAir _ then the plane might nose over
without the sudden spin, but airspeed should not have increased
that dramatically. Sources said the plane accelerated to speeds
approaching the sound barrier and broke apart just before it
crashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the plane starts to go down, it is hard to see it
accelerating, although it is possible, particularly if the reverse
thrusters were only partially deployed,'' said Hansman.
</P>
<P>
   A federal aviation accident investigator, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said: ``It still could be thrust reverser, but the
radar doesn't support it. There is a little bit of yaw on the
radar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't understand why it would crash like that from a
thrust reverser _ the sudden dive and the acceleration,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane behaved more like the tail section had been ripped
away, he said, then added ominously: ``I am troubled by the number
of military personnel on the airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   The EgyptAir plane carried about 30 Egyptian military officers,
many of them army pilots, who had been flying AH-64 ``Apache''
attack helicopters during training exercises in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The thrust reverser on the left engine of the ill-fated jet was
disabled on Oct. 28 in Cairo after it was discovered to be leaking
hydraulic fluid, airline officials said. The thrust reverser was
not repaired because the right parts were unavailable. The plane
can land without using the thrust reservers.
</P>
<P>
   Roshdy Zakaria, the acting chief pilot of Boeing 767s for
EgyptAir, said he talked with members of Flight 990's flight crew
when the plane was in Los Angeles about flying with the
de-activated thrust reverser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you need the aircraft and don't have enough time to
repair it,'' said Zakaria.
</P>
<P>
   Zakaria said his pilots train every six months on a simulator
for unusual conditions, such as a thrust reverser deploying in
flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is reverse thrusters on one side create a drag so
(the airplane) turns on the side of the reverse thruster,'' he
said. ``There is a rapid application (of rudder) to prevent it from
doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   While the condition is very dangerous at low altitudes, Flight
990 was cruising at 33,000 feet, giving the crew enough time to
counteract the problem by returning the engines to idle and then
working to correct it.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 990 stayed on an easterly course, but dropped to 16,700
feet in about 40 seconds _ a rate of descent of 24,000 feet per
minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was reverse thruster it would not give this accelerated
rate of descent,'' Zakaria said, noting the maximum rate of descent
on the jet is 7,000 feet to 8,000 feet ``if you are trying as hard
as you can.''
</P>
<P>
   After the plane's thrust reverser was deactivated, it flew on to
several cities, including Beirut and Rome, before heading from
Cairo to New York on Oct. 30. From there, the jet headed to Los
Angeles and stopped at New York's John F. Kennedy International
Airport on its return to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   In Cairo, Maged El Masry, EgyptAir's vice president for
technical services, said maintenance crews had made several
modifications to the thrust reverser system in the wake of a 1991
Lauda Air Boeing 767 that crashed in Thailand when one of its
thrust reversers deployed in flight.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing personnel did work on the aircraft in 1993 in Paris and
British Airways personnel did work last year at Heathrow, Masry
said.
</P>
<P>
   As it went down early Sunday, Flight 990 issued no distress
call, which does not surprise one commercial airline pilot who
flies the Boeing 767. He said the two-person crew was most likely
consumed with two things: trying to regain control of the airplane
and figuring out what was going wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the cockpit voice recorder will bear that out,'' the
pilot said.
</P>
<P>
   While the cockpit panel should have indicated if there was a
deployment of one or both of the thrust reversers in flight, the
buffeting the plane likely took in its dive may have made it
difficult to read the instrument.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never been in anything like that, but I have been in
some heavy turbulence and sometimes you are rattled so much that
you can't focus on the instruments right away,'' the pilot said.
</P>
<P>
   The EgyptAir jet that crashed last weekend had skidded off the
end of a runway at the Istanbul airport in August, but no one was
hurt and the plane was not damaged, airline officials said. They
said weather and poor runway conditions were responsible for the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   El Masry said the plane's flight data recorder tracks 64
different flight charatersitcs, including whether the thrust
reverser were deployed or stowed. Boeing officials said when the
plane was delivered to EgyptAir in September 1989 the installed
flight recorder measured 55 parameters of flight.
</P>
<P>
   Recovery of those recorders will be the top priority once Navy
vessels, equipped with high-tech sonar equipment and
remote-controlled underwater submersibles, can return to the crash
site.

GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH AMERICA

   &UR; Sergei Khrushchev &LR; , son of the late Soviet premier  &UR; Nikita &LR; 
 &UR; Khrushchev &LR;  and a new U.S. citizen, writes about the Cold War from
the Soviet point of view in the latest issue of American Heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The first time Pa  &UR; Khrushchev &LR;  and  &UR; Dwight Eisenhower &LR;  got to
talk with each other was at the Four-Power Summit Conference in
Geneva in 1955. ``The process of getting acquainted was not without
its curious moments,'' writes Khrushchev.
</P>
<P>
   ``During one of the breaks between sessions, Eisenhower
introduced Father to his assistant  &UR; Nelson Rockefeller &LR; . Father
inquired, `Is he that Rockefeller?' As Father told me when he
returned to Moscow, his curiosity was very much aroused when he was
told that this was indeed that Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   ``A multimillionaire, but looking no different from anyone else,
not in top hat and tails, but modestly dressed, moreover serving in
a subordinate position. Continuing his account, Father said that he
was dying to touch a real millionaire, but he didn't know how that
would be taken. He didn't hesitate for long, though, but spread his
arms and embraced Rockefeller somewhere around the waist
(Rockefeller was a head and a half taller than Father). At first
Rockefeller was taken aback, but after a moment, he responded in

author  &UR; Naomi Wolf &LR;  $15,000 a month to consult with the candidate
on speaking ``from the heart'' and dressing better, the Washington
Post asked  &UR; Christopher Buckley &LR;  to suggest other consultants:
</P>
<P>
   Buckley recommended  &UR; Frank McCourt &LR;  ($20,000 a month) to
``advise Gore on how to spin his childhood at the Fairfax Hotel
into a tale of misery and destitution''; Reagan biographer  &UR; Edmund &LR; 
 &UR; Morris &LR;  (same salary as McCourt) could ``advise on how to convince
voters that he saved 78 people from drowning at the St. Albans
school pool''; $50,000 a month to  &UR; George Stephanopoulos &LR;  for
recommending ways to distance himself from ``one of our greatest
presidents.''

   The noise from Secret Service helicopters flying overhead
prevented most guests from hearing Gore's remarks, delivered in the
garden, reported the New York Daily News. Club owner  &UR; Nell &LR; 
 &UR; Campbell &LR;  draped one arm around the candidate and shared her
thoughts directly: ``Darling, one last thought before I go. Ban
firearms, legalize drugs and, by the way, best of luck to you,
darling.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported that Brown and Evans cleared their
apartment for the soiree by having most of their furniture placed

 &HT;    Cracker Barrel denies discrimination charges
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cracker Barrel Old Country Store says it doesn't
discriminate against black employees. The assertion comes in a
court filing that responds to a discrimination lawsuit filed in
July.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanon, Tenn.-based restaurant chain also asked a U.S.
District Court judge to deny the plaintiffs' efforts to have the
suit granted class action status.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Rome, Ga., alleges
Cracker Barrel systematically discriminated against blacks in such
areas as hiring, promotions and pay. Originally, the lawsuit was
filed on behalf of a dozen current and former employees.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the plaintiffs could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In its answer, Cracker Barrel said some of the actions taken
against employees ``were based upon legitimate, nondiscriminatory
factors'' other than race.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said it acted to prevent and correct any
alleged racial harassment and that it has a policy against such
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   It addresses some specifics, though it is vague in its answers.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Stephen Wilson, a grill cook in Dalton, alleged in
the original complaint that he was paid less than white cooks, was
given unequal work schedules and subjected to unfair discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said he requested and was denied time off July 4, 1998.
When he disregarded the schedule and failed to appear for work he
was suspended and reprimanded. But Wilson claims in the lawsuit
that when a white employee did the same, he was not disciplined. He
also said a white manager frequently referred to blacks as ``boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cracker Barrel admits Wilson was reprimanded and suspended for
taking the day off without permission, but it said it did not have
sufficient information to determine whether a white employee wasn't
disciplined for also taking the day off.
</P>
<P>
   The answer filed earlier this week ``strongly'' disputes the
claims made by the plaintiffs, said Julie Davis, a Cracker Barrel
spokeswoman. ``As the case unfolds we will demonstrate that Cracker
Barrel is strongly committed to fairness and opportunity for all
employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Cracker Barrel has about 50,00 full- and part-time employees.

   &UR; Sergei Khrushchev &LR; , son of the late Soviet premier  &UR; Nikita &LR; 
 &UR; Khrushchev &LR;  and a new U.S. citizen, writes about the Cold War from
the Soviet point of view in the latest issue of American Heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The first time Pa  &UR; Khrushchev &LR;  and  &UR; Dwight Eisenhower &LR;  got to
talk with each other was at the Four-Power Summit Conference in
Geneva in 1955. ``The process of getting acquainted was not without
its curious moments,'' writes Khrushchev.
</P>
<P>
   ``During one of the breaks between sessions, Eisenhower
introduced Father to his assistant  &UR; Nelson Rockefeller &LR; . Father
inquired, `Is he that Rockefeller?' As Father told me when he
returned to Moscow, his curiosity was very much aroused when he was
told that this was indeed that Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   ``A multimillionaire, but looking no different from anyone else,
not in top hat and tails, but modestly dressed, moreover serving in
a subordinate position. Continuing his account, Father said that he
was dying to touch a real millionaire, but he didn't know how that
would be taken. He didn't hesitate for long, though, but spread his
arms and embraced Rockefeller somewhere around the waist
(Rockefeller was a head and a half taller than Father). At first
Rockefeller was taken aback, but after a moment, he responded in
kind.''

author  &UR; Naomi Wolf &LR;  $15,000 a month to consult with the candidate
on speaking ``from the heart'' and dressing better, the Washington
Post asked  &UR; Christopher Buckley &LR;  to suggest other consultants:
</P>
<P>
   Buckley recommended  &UR; Frank McCourt &LR;  ($20,000 a month) to
``advise Gore on how to spin his childhood at the Fairfax Hotel
into a tale of misery and destitution''; Reagan biographer  &UR; Edmund &LR; 
 &UR; Morris &LR;  (same salary as McCourt) could ``advise on how to convince
voters that he saved 78 people from drowning at the St. Albans
school pool''; $50,000 a month to  &UR; George Stephanopoulos &LR;  for
recommending ways to distance himself from ``one of our greatest
presidents.''

prevented most guests from hearing Gore's remarks, delivered in the
garden, reported the New York Daily News. Club owner  &UR; Nell &LR;

thoughts directly: ``Darling, one last thought before I go. Ban
firearms, legalize drugs and, by the way, best of luck to you,
darling.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported that Brown and Evans cleared their

BUSH DEFENDS SKIPPING DEBATE TO BE WITH WIFE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEREDITH, N.H. _ Even as he stepped up his grass-roots
campaigning in this key primary state, GOP presidential
front-runner George W. Bush defended again Wednesday his decision
to skip a nationally televised candidates' forum in the state last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to apologize for anything,'' Bush told reporters
after addressing a local Chamber of Commerce breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that he missed the town-hall meeting last Thursday at
Dartmouth College because it was more important for him to be with
his wife, Laura, who received a distinguished alumna award from
Southern Methodist University in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the right choice as far as I am concerned. People can
either accept that explanation or not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But some of his rivals have suggested that the governor missed
last week's forum and a previous debate in the state to avoid
unpredictable confrontations that could endanger his lead status.
</P>
<P>
   And the governor was clearly feeling a bit defensive about what
he referred to at one event as the ``flap about my wife Laura.''
During his one-and-a-half-day trip to the first primary state, the
governor raised the issue at every event, even though voters did
not bring it up.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also appeared to be getting the message _ underscored by
the rise in New Hampshire polls of Arizona Sen. John McCain _ that
he had not been spending enough time meeting voters in the state.
</P>
<P>
   As he traveled across the rural northern tier of the state Bush
appeared eager to demonstrate that he could mix and mingle as well
as any of his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   At the Elks Club in Littleton he spent more than an hour shaking
hands with the more than 300 people who came to hear him speak.
Earlier he waded through a crowd at the Littleton Diner, plopping
down in the booths next to residents to hear their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is expected to visit the state again next week briefly. He
will also participate in a debate Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to look 100,000 or so voters in the eye and say, `I
want your vote and here's why''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also made a point of taking questions from the audience at
every event where he spoke _ a deviation from his usually carefully
scripted events.
</P>
<P>
   But he was clearly not prepared for all the queries. At the
Littleton Chamber dinner, one man doggedly questioned Bush about
his record on gay rights, suggesting the governor had done little
in Texas to help gays.
</P>
<P>
   At one point the clearly exasperated candidate interrupted the
man, barking, ``Let me tell you something, buddy...''
</P>
<P>
   The governor later said he ``was for equal rights, not special
rights'' for gays. He also said he was against gay marriages.
</P>
<P>
   At a Chamber luncheon in Gorham, Bush had a hard time answering
a friendlier question about how he would help rural areas that had
not benefited from the high-tech revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's answer ran almost five minutes and included comments
about the ``American dream touching every willing heart,'' the
``downloading of classics on the Internet'' and a man in Texas who
had his ear examined on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bush ably fielded other questions on Medicare, foreign
relations and education.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's decision to skip the Dartmouth town hall meeting last
week elicited differing reactions from those who came to hear him
in Meredith.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supporter Mary Jean Robison said she was not upset that the
governor missed the forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a responsibility to be with his wife,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rick Buckler, a banker and undecided voter, said it was
mistake for Bush to miss the town hall meeting at Dartmouth, saying
that voters didn't know enough about him.
</P>
<P>
   Buckler also wasn't satisfied with Bush's decision to stay with
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commitments get changed every day in business and life,''
Buckler said.

CLINTON, CITING LATEST SHOOTINGS, DEMANDS TOUGHER GUN CONTROL
LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton expressed ``shock and profound
sorrow'' over Wednesday's shootings in Seattle and demanded that
Congress enact stronger gun control laws.
</P>
<P>
   But despite a spate of mass shootings over the past year,
Congress appears set to adjourn without approving any of the more
than 125 gun control measures introduced this session.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates including Vice President Al Gore and Sen.
Patty Murray, angered by the killing of seven office workers in
Honolulu on Tuesday and two office workers in Seattle Wednesday,
plan to hold a news conference at the Capitol Thursday calling on
Congress to act.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's incident in Seattle, a lone gunman opened fire
with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun in an office building along the
north side of Lake Union, just north of downtown, killing two and
wounding two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation continues on this day to be reminded of the horrors
of gun violence,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to do more to keep guns out of the hands of criminals
and children,'' he said. ``Congress needs to send me common-sense
legislation that closes the gun show loophole, bans the importation
of large ammunition clips, and has child safety locks as a
requirement of new gun sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates, primarily Democrats, are irate at the
congressional inaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is extremely difficult to watch your own neighborhood and
your own backyard become the next scene of one of these horrific
incidences of gun violence, and it again raises the question of
when we as a country are going to do something,'' said Sen. Patty
Murray, D-Wash., who lives along Lake Union and often walks by the
shooting site. ``The National Rifle Association has a lockhold on
legislation here, and the only thing that's going to break that is
a public outcry.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., who represents Seattle in Congress,
also said Congress is paralyzed on gun measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inability of this Congress to act is appalling,'' he said.
``You have to come to the conclusion that the financial
contributions of the National Rifle Association are more important
than dealing with what's worrying people.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the National Rifle Association did not return a
call for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Gun rights supporters, primarily Republicans, insist that the
best approach to gun violence is better enforcement of existing gun
laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``This senseless act of violence further validates the need for
rigorous enforcement of the law and shoring up of our resolve to
ensure that we keep guns out of the hands of those who shouldn't
have them,'' said Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash. ``I encourage each of
us to do our part so that we can pull our families and communities
together to stop violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the organizations Handgun Control and the
Violence Policy Center said that, despite a flurry of talk about
gun control after the shooting at Columbine High School in Denver
in April, Congress appears unlikely to enact any changes to gun
laws this year. The Senate in May narrowly approved a measure
tightening restrictions on sales of guns at gun shows, but the
House in June rejected such restrictions. A negotiating committee
charged with sorting out the differences between House and Senate
hasn't met since August.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that Americans seem to have become inured to gun
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we understand fully just how much more violent
the United States is than other countries,'' he said. ``We do not
have to tolerate this level of violence. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``There will never be a time when any society can guarantee that
no one will ever kill anybody else,'' he said. ``But we can do
much, much more without interfering with people's hunting and
sporting rights to keep guns out of the wrong hands. And we can do
more to put more police on the street; we can do more to work with
our children. And we have to do all of that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Clinton said he would do anything he can to
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I join with all Americans in expressing shock and profound
sorrow at the shootings which have occurred over the last two days
in Honolulu and Seattle,'' he said. ``I have been briefed on both
situations. The federal government has offered all appropriate
assistance to local officials. Our thoughts and prayers are with
the victims and with their families.''

<P>
   Having to get married in a big hurry in order to inherit a huge
fortune was a creaky comedy concept in 1925, when Buster Keaton
made the most that could be made of it with his slapstick spectacle
``Seven Chances.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest rendition, ``The Bachelor,'' isn't fit to shine the
silent version's spats.
</P>
<P>
   Starring and co-produced by that nice but, well, too nice Chris
O'Donnell, ``Bachelor'' could really use, at the very least, some
intentional misanthropy to go with its unexamined, unfunny
misogyny. If O'Donnell could come off as half the jerk he's
pretending to play _ or if that guy had anything like the Great
Stone Face's obtuse self-absorption _ the movie might have
generated more than one laugh.
</P>
<P>
   That lone chortle comes fairly early on in the film, when
O'Donnell's Jimmy Shannon, the heir to a San Francisco billiards
table manufacturing fortune (of all things), asks his longtime
girlfriend, Anne (Renee Zellweger), to marry him with the preamble
``You win.'' Understandably swept right onto her feet, Anne
declines, though she is clearly destined to forgive and accept by
movie's end.
</P>
<P>
   But first the film has to go through the motions of making it
hard, especially once Jimmy's procreation-obsessed granddad (Peter
Ustinov) dies and leaves a 24-hour deadline for the lad to get
hitched or forfeit his inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   Much running time is spent looking up past girlfriends, all of
whom say no and are stereotyped as one kind of female demon or
another. Mariah Carey _ playing, unimaginatively, a diva _ is not
presented attractively, which is quite an accomplishment, and
quickly cut away from when speaking instead of singing. For her
part, Brooke Shields is encouraged to chainsmoke and fritter and
generally grate.
</P>
<P>
   It all culminates, like the Keaton version, with 1,000
wedding-gowned hopefuls who've responded to a newspaper ad chasing
Jimmy through the streets. Unlike the Keaton version, however, no
visual comedic ingenuity is applied to these scenes.
</P>
<P>
   The director is Gary Sinyor, who last made the
missed-opportunity spoof of English heritage films ``Stiff Upper
Lips.'' The job he does here may not be inept, but it is thoroughly
uninspired. Zellweger manages a sweet moment or two and Artie
Lange, as Jimmy's coarse best buddy, provides a smidgen of the
raunchiness the movie could probably have used a lot more of. Like
Ustinov's, the potential comic contributions of Edward Asner and
Hal Holbrook remain just that: potential.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Carlos Guzman will never forget last year's New York
City Marathon, when he and dozens of other athletes in wheelchairs
felt deeply humiliated after being stopped for nearly half an hour
at the Queensboro Bridge to allow the lead elite runners to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only place where this happens to us,'' Guzman
said, ticking off other marathons where he had been treated more
equitably. ``Here they act as if we are a hindrance to the others.
It's something awful. I train like everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   For Guzman and other wheelchair athletes, the New York City
Marathon has always been a bittersweet event. Though it is the
largest and among the most famous marathons in America, the New
York City Marathon has never had a separate division with prizes
for wheelchair athletes. Several times over the years athletes have
complained that they were held up to let footracers pass. In a few
instances, they have even been kept from crossing the finish line
in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, the race is being held against the backdrop
of a lawsuit filed last July in federal court in Brooklyn, in which
nine wheelchair athletes alleged that the marathon's organizers had
repeatedly discriminated against them under the Americans With
Disabilities Act. These athletes see the 1999 marathon on Sunday as
a test to determine if the New York Road Runners Club, which is in
charge of the race, has changed what they perceive to be a
prejudiced attitude towards them.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to avoid a court order, the Road Runners agreed last
month not to ``unreasonably or unlawfully obstruct'' the wheelchair
racers this year. They also promised not to deflect news media
attention from the wheelchair racers and to allow them to cross the
finish line like everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the disabled athletes say that the suit has not been
settled and that these stipulations do not resolve the heart of the
dispute. They maintain that the marathon's organizers not only have
a history of bias against wheelchair competitors but have lagged
behind a recent trend in the sport by refusing to create a separate
division with prizes for wheelchair racers.
</P>
<P>
   Though marathon officials admit they have resisted setting up a
separate division, they insist that they have not discriminated
against wheelchair athletes. They say that the police and other
city officials have decided to hold up the wheelchair athletes for
their own safety.
</P>
<P>
   But some marathon runners say that their safety is sometimes at
stake, too. While many are sympathetic to the wheelchair athletes,
the runner says that the wheelchairs can be a hazard; the
wheelchair racers can reach speeds of up to 40 mph going downhill,
making it difficult for tired runners to scramble out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Robert L. Laufer, the general counsel for the Road Runners Club,
said the wheelchair athletes' complaints arise from logistical
problems unique to New York's marathon, an open event with more
than 30,000 participants who cross several bridges and major
streets in all five boroughs. More than 140 athletes in wheelchairs
are expected to compete this year. ``New York is unlike any other
marathon with regard to the bridges and the number of streets it
crosses,'' Laufer said. ``We do try to accommodate them.''
</P>
<P>
   As in most city marathons, the wheelchair athletes start the
race half an hour before the first phalanx of elite runners sets
off. Unlike in the Boston Marathon and some other events, there is
no minimum qualifying time for any entrant in New York. Since the
world's top wheelchair athletes can complete a marathon in less
than 1 hour 40 minutes, they generally reach the finish line before
the first runners, who complete the course in just over 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   But trouble inevitably arises when the fastest runners,
accompanied by cars carrying reporters and race officials, catch up
to the slower wheelchair athletes. That happened last year at the
Queensboro Bridge. One lane of the bridge was under construction,
leaving only two lanes for the runners. The wheelchair competitors
were ordered by police officers to wait until the top runners had
passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stopped them for safety reasons, because the lead vehicles
were not far behind them and we feared they would be endangered by
overcrowding when the lead vehicles reached the bridge,'' Allan
Steinfeld, the president of the Road Runners, said in a recent
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Though Steinfeld acknowledged responsibility for the decision,
Laufer said no club officials were present and that the police had
made the call. ``It was certainly not the Road Runners Club that
made that decision,'' he said. ``We had no agent at the bridge.''
Steinfeld did not return telephone messages from a reporter trying
to clarify the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The question of who makes these decisions is at the center of
the lawsuit. The Road Runners say the responsibility is spread
among the police and other city officials along the route. But
Daniel L. Brown, a lawyer for the disabled athletes, says that the
police usually act at the behest of the race organizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stop you during the race and they try to convince you
it's for safety reasons, but it's really that they want the foot
people to cross first,'' said Bob Neumayer, a wheelchair athlete
who has competed in the New York Marathon 13 times.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two decades, wheelchair racing has evolved from an
exhibition event, aimed mostly at inspiring disabled people, to a
sport in its own right, with specialized equipment, wheelchair
athletes say.
</P>
<P>
   Wheelchair divisions have become a fixture in many major
marathons around the world, from Berlin to Los Angeles, complete
with prize money and awards. Some elite wheelchair racers, like
Franz Nietlispach of Switzerland, have become professionals,
touring from event to event and getting endorsements from major
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Marathons in Boston, Chicago, Atlanta, Los Angeles and Houston
have wheelchair divisions with prizes. Most of these races have
also found ways to confront the logistical puzzle of lead runners
overtaking wheelchair athletes. The solution is usually as simple
as in Chicago, where race officials tell wheelchair athletes to
keep to the right so the top runners can pass.
</P>
<P>
   Some New York race officials said they have resisted creating a
wheelchair division for fear that it would lead to additional
demands from other disabled groups, including blind runners,
amputees, cancer victims and diabetics. It would be difficult to
know where to draw the line, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The feud between the wheelchair athletes and the Road Runners
Club goes back to 1978, when Bob Hall, an early pioneer of
wheelchair racing, sued the club after it denied him a spot in the
race because he was disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The State Human Rights Commission agreed with Hall, and he was
allowed to compete in the 1978 and 1979 marathons. But the Road
Runners appealed through the state courts, until the New York Court
of Appeals finally ruled in the club's favor in 1982; the state's
highest court defined the wheelchairs as vehicles and said they
could be banned from a footrace.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, Mayor Ed Koch intervened, declaring that
unless wheelchair racers were allowed to compete, the city would
not allow the marathon on public streets. The Road Runners
relented.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can name other events _ Boston, Berlin, Frankfurt, Atlanta
_ each of these cities have included people with disabilities in an
equitable program,'' Hall said. ``New York seems to have put aside
the disabled in the free-for-all of entries. They don't seem to
care and never have seemed to care.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Hall said, a police motorcycle pulled in front of him
and slowed his progress to a crawl as he was beginning to pass the
lead female racers at the eight-mile mark.
</P>
<P>
   Hall did not return to New York until 1995, when race officials
decided that high winds made crossing the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge
too dangerous for wheelchair racers. The officials bused the racers
across the bridge after the rest of the runners had started. The
buses were not equipped for the disabled, and a wheelchair racer
broke a leg while being transported.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Brown, a 32-year-old sports marketing agent from Florida
who had trained for three years for the marathon, said he was
stopped in the 1992 race for 10 minutes by volunteers at the
entrance of Central Park to allow the lead foot runner to enter the
park alone. Before being halted, Brown had struggled for nearly 10
miles with a broken wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Such, a 25-year-old professional racer from Wilkes-Barre,
Pa., finished first among all participants in last year's marathon
with a time of 1 hour 47 minutes. He says he was not allowed to
cross the finish line in the middle, where a ribbon was reserved
for footracers, but was instead shunted off onto a special lane to
the right. ``I had to cross the finish line all the way to one
side,'' Such said. ``The way they handle the wheelchair division is
out of line. It's a slap in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Laufer, the Road Runners Club's lawyer, said that the Achilles
Track Club, which oversees the participation of the disabled in the
marathon, has done its best to accommodate all handicapped people,
including wheelchair racers. He said the organizers have provided
special staging areas and recovery areas with accessible toilets.
The Achilles Club also gives two honorary awards, but no prize
money, to disabled racers who perform exceptionally well.
</P>
<P>
   But it is precisely this point that upsets some wheelchair
athletes. Some resent being lumped together with blind athletes,
amputees, cancer victims, diabetics and people in hand-cranked
chairs or electric-powered chairs. They believe their sport has
become a legitimate event, on a par with the footrace, and should
no longer be treated as a heartwarming sideshow to the runners.
</P>
<P>
   The Road Runners, meanwhile, view the suit as a wedge to coerce
them to do what other cities have done. ``I think what they are
really looking for ultimately is basically to have a separate
wheelchair race with awards and prize money,'' Laufer said. ``We
haven't gotten to that point yet, but it's something we will
consider.''

COMMENTARY: BREATHING WHILE BLACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal appeals court says it's all right, but it's not all
right.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the lead paragraph from the New York Times story on a
decision last week by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals:
</P>
<P>
   ``A federal appeals court ruled yesterday that police officers
in Oneonta, N.Y., did not violate the Constitution when they tried
to stop every black man in town in 1992 after a woman said she had
been robbed in her home by a young black man.''
</P>
<P>
   Got that? Every black man in town.
</P>
<P>
   This is New York, mind you, not Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing that a black man had committed a crime, the cops
went after every black man they saw walking the streets. They
dragooned black men and boys (and at least one black woman!) who
were trying to use public transportation. They pulled over black
guys riding in cars. They went to the State University of New York
at Oneonta and got a list of all the black students in the school,
and they went after them.
</P>
<P>
   These were all innocent people. The cops never did find the
alleged assailant. But that didn't matter. Neither their rights as
citizens nor their humanity mattered. These were black people, and
whatever you do to them is all right. They may have been
masquerading as human beings, but Oneonta's men in blue (assisted
by the state police) could see right through that disguise.
</P>
<P>
   The manhunt began early on the morning of Sept. 4, 1992, when a
77-year-old woman told police she had been attacked by a burglar.
The woman, who was white, said she never saw the man's face but
could tell from his arm and hand that he was black. She said she
thought he was young because he moved quickly. She said the man had
a knife and had cut himself on the hand while struggling with her.
He then fled.
</P>
<P>
   A canine unit tracked the scent of the alleged assailant for
several hundred yards before losing it. Investigators said the path
of the scent pointed toward the university campus. That's all the
cops had to go on.
</P>
<P>
   No problem. There weren't all that many black people in Oneonta.
Of the 14,000 full-time residents fewer than 500 are black. And
only about 2 percent of the 7,500 students at the university are
black. So the cops, smart enough to know a black person when they
see one, decided to stop every black guy in the town to see if one
of them had a cut on his hand.
</P>
<P>
   This went far beyond the problem of driving while black. People
were being stopped in Oneonta for breathing while black. Trust me,
if some poor guy had innocently cut his finger while slicing a
tomato for dinner he would have landed in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The cops never did find their man, but they humiliated a lot of
people in the process. In last week's opinion, a three-judge panel
of the 2nd Circuit said: ``We are not blind to the sense of
frustration that was doubtlessly felt by those questioned by the
police during this investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   But the panel ruled that this police sweep of blacks in Oneonta
was OK, that it was constitutionally permissible, that it was not a
violation of the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment or
the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable seizures.
Never mind the breathtaking totality of the sweep. Never mind that
the cops were not considering any other aspect of the so-called
description except race. Never mind that this would never happen to
the white residents of Oneonta. The court ruled that the stops were
not racially discriminatory because, in the court's view, the cops
were acting on a description that included more than just the color
of the alleged assailant.
</P>
<P>
   With this ruling, cops are free to harass any and all black
people as long as they have in hand a complaint that a black person
has committed a crime. If you are black, you are a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, which upheld a similar ruling by a lower court, grew
out of a lawsuit filed against the Oneonta cops and the state
police by several of the people caught up in the sweep. The case
against the plaintiffs was argued by lawyers from the office of
State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who had a statutory
obligation to defend the state in the suit, but who made it clear
that he was uncomfortable with the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read the circuit opinion,'' he said Wednesday. ``And I said,
`You know what? We won the case but it makes your skin crawl.'''

 &HT;    Copyright control at center of concern over King papers
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Growing congressional concern about copyright
control over the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s private papers is
hampering negotiations to buy the collection from the slain civil
rights leader's family.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans and Democrats say that if federal funds are
used to purchase the papers for $20 million, then the Library of
Congress should own the copyright of the collection.
</P>
<P>
   The King family has expressed an interest in retaining at least
partial copyright control, which would result in lucrative royalty
fees if the papers are used in a commercial fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Under such an agreement, if the collection of 80,000 documents
is used to create an educational computer program or to write a
book, royalties for the use of the King papers would go to the King
family.
</P>
<P>
   The King family would not comment directly about negotiations
over the copyright. Robert Vickers, a family spokesman, said a
statement by Dexter Scott King, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s
son, on Oct. 27 still stands.
</P>
<P>
   King said then that by accepting a payment that is far below the
$30 million appraised value of the papers, the family was ``meeting
our fiduciary responsibility to the estate of Dr. King while making
a substantial gift to the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Jill Brett, public affairs officer at the Library of Congress,
said that 99 percent of its collection is donated and therefore the
library accepts donor requests for copyright control in certain
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The library traditionally makes an effort to retain certain
rights when we obtain a collection, but we have allowed reasonable
restrictions on a case-by-case basis on donations in the past,''
Brett said. Reasonable restrictions would include copyright control
on literary works of noted authors and historical figures.
</P>
<P>
   But the purchase of the King papers is different, lawmakers say,
because the collection would be purchased, not donated.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are going to purchase or acquire the papers, we ought to
have full control over the papers,'' said Rep. John Boehner
(R-Ohio), a senior member of the House Administration Committee,
which has jurisdiction over the Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) and Rep. John Lewis
(D-Ga.) are working to bring legislation to the floor authorizing
the Library of Congress to purchase or acquire the papers through
private donations.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed such a measure, but the authorization is
stalled in the House over the copyright issue and over a sense
among members that the papers should be donated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know a president or any national figure who hasn't
donated their papers,'' said Rep. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) ``The
papers are important, but this is unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the civil rights movement agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this contradicts directly what Dr. King stood for and
believed in: that there are more important things than material
wealth,'' said Gilbert Jonas, a chief NAACP fund-raiser for 30
years who donated his own papers to the Library of Congress. ``The
man who stood for the spiritual values of this country is being
exploited.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonas said he cannot think of any members of the civil rights
movement who sold their papers to the Library of Congress or other
institution.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just the commercialization of the King legacy that
has prompted concern.
</P>
<P>
   Historians are equally worried about the collection that will be
left behind at the King Center in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Cook, former director of the King Library's archives and
museum in Atlanta, said the papers that Congress wants to buy
include documents from King's involvement with the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference.
</P>
<P>
   But Cook said those papers were separated from another
collection of SCLC papers donated to the King Center in 1977,
because Coretta Scott King kept them at her house.
</P>
<P>
   The two collections should be kept together for historical
purposes, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any scholar would consider them to be inseparable,'' Cook
said. ``They are two separate collections, but had the documents
held by Mrs. King been available at the time, they would have been
considered as one.''
</P>
<P>
   Both collections contain similar documents, including
handwritten notes, drafts of speeches, reports and correspondence
with major civil rights leaders such as Andrew Young.
</P>
<P>
   Cook left the King Center in 1987 over a fundamental
disagreement with the way the papers were being stored and concern
over the King estate charging fees to use the papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am gravely concerned about the future of the SCLC
collection, as it has a very significant historical value for our
nation and for scholars,'' Cook said. ``Because Dr. King was the
founding president of SCLC, I don't know how to distinguish what
was his and what was SCLC's.''
</P>
<P>
   David Garrow, a historian at Emory University and King
biographer, agrees with Cook's assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important question right now is what does this mean
for the SCLC papers and the SNCC (Student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee) papers?'' Garrow said.
</P>
<P>
   Brett, at the Library of Congress, said that the other papers
had not been considered as part of the negotiations.

 BLOODIED 49ers HAVE A SNOWBALL'S CHANCE IN NFL  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ You've read and heard all the dire reports
about the demise of the 49ers, how this is the end of the run after
nearly two decades of excellence, how that darn salary cap
strangled the team until its eyeballs popped out, how personnel
mistakes by Vinny Cerrato, Dwight Clark, Carmen Policy and yes,
Bill Walsh are causing the team to look like it's running in
quicksand wearing concrete boots while carrying stacks of
unabridged dictionaries.
</P>
<P>
   They're all true.
</P>
<P>
   However, there's still the small matter of nine games remaining
on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   After four days off in their bye week, the 49ers returned for a
rare full practice on Monday in preparation for the Pittsburgh
Steelers Sunday at Candlestick. They appeared fresh, relaxed, even
frisky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to freshen up, physically, mentally, emotionally,''
coach Steve Mariucci said. ``We needed to take a step away and
re-charge our batteries. We are on a mission to get this thing
rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, but it's rolling now, albeit heading downhill and gathering
momentum after three straight losses. Look out below!
</P>
<P>
   A year ago after a loss Mariucci likened the revolting
development to a snowball and said the 49ers ``could not stop the
bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   That became my favorite new mixed metaphor for the image it
created of a giant, bloody snowball inexorably tumbling down a
mountain toward a terror-stricken little town as it collects
boulders, trees, X-Games participants and unfortunate alpacas along
the way.
</P>
<P>
   If one loss a year ago in a 12-4 season was a bloody snowball,
imagine how big and bloody the snowball is this year.
</P>
<P>
   In its ever-expanding and rolling mass can be found the Ruin of
'99 _ Steve Young's cranium, Garrison Hearst's ankle, Jerry Rice's
knee, Greg Clark's broken ribs and collapsed lung, every lousy
out-of-work cornerback in the league, the unread game plan for the
season opener at Jacksonville, various pieces of stale yet free
pizza from the team's last victory a month ago and a forgotten
pocket hanky from one of Policy's snazzy suits.
</P>
<P>
   To stop this bloody snowball will take a monumental effort on
the part of the 49ers. It will take a mighty gantlet of
flamethrowers positioned on either side to melt the irresistible
force as it rolls by, or a squadron of jet fighters dropping
firebombs on the menacing mass. Serious heat is needed.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it will take a team effort of the sort the 49ers
put up Sept. 27 at Arizona but not since. That looked like a good
win at the time, but the Cardinals are 2-5 now and have their own
bloody snowball to contend with.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the NFC West, usually a cakewalk for whoever
wins the silly thing, has developed into a pie fight and the Rams
are the ones with all the baked goods, flinging away joyously even
after their first loss of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers could yet right a season gone wrong because they play
in the weakest division this side of the Pac-10. Of their nine
remaining games, four are against New Orleans, Carolina and Atlanta
(twice), with a bonus cream pie against Cincinnati on Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Win those five and that would give the Team of the '80s eight
wins as it gets ready for the '00s.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves three pivotal games in four weeks this month that
will determine whether San Francisco advances to the playoffs or
finds itself out of the mix for the first time since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   (Historical note: That '91 team won its final six games and was
the hottest team in the league at the end of the season, leading
many members of Mensa to conclude it would have gone on to win the
Super Bowl that year had it only qualified for the playoffs, but it
didn't because of a Hail Mary defeat in Atlanta eight years ago
Wednesday.)
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers are first up Sunday, a strange team with a strong
defense and a putz of an offense. Then it's on to New Orleans to
face the demoralized Ditkas followed by home games against St.
Louis and Green Bay, the latter on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers are beatable, De La Salle could extend its victory
streak vs. the Saints and the Packers are in a funk with Brett
Favre throwing interceptions at the same rate as a politician
shaking hands.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 49ers are at the dry, dusty end of their run as a
dominant team, the season itself is not yet lost. They can still
win a few games and perpetuate their image as proud champions
refusing to go down without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   It won't matter, though. The league is now stocked with teams
that are younger, stronger and faster. That snowball is getting
bigger and bloodier with each turn.

TEXAS TEEN RELEASED AFTER HALLOWEEN HORROR STORY LANDS HIM IN JAIL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christopher Beamon is back on the bricks, but the five days he
spent in jail for writing a Halloween horror story for a high
school English class has added a new dimension to the debate over
school safety in the wake of Columbine and Jonesboro.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has gone from confusion to absurdity to bizarre,'' said
William Short, the Dallas lawyer who managed to get his 13-year-old
client released from the Denton County jail Tuesday by calling the
case to the attention of the news media. ``Overreaction is the
nicest way you could phrase it.``
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile court records largely are sealed by law, but Short said
Beamon apparently was charged with ``writing a terroristic note and
threatening two kids and a teacher'' at his high school in Ponder,
a small town near Denton in North Texas, last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a note,'' he said. ``It was a story that was
assigned by the teacher. She gave them a setting _ you're in a dark
room and you hear a noise _ to build a story from. She told them to
make it ghoulish ... the most horrible thing you can think about.''
</P>
<P>
   Beamon's story, which he read in class, involved getting high on
Freon and shooting two classmates and ``Mrs. (Amanda) Henry,'' the
teacher who assigned the story.
</P>
<P>
   Henry would not comment on the incident, but a statement
released by the school superintendent, Dr. Byron Welch, said the
teacher and parents of some students in the class ``expressed
concerns'' about the content of the story ``that these students,
their parents and the teacher found threatening.'' County juvenile
authorities were then contacted, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, two deputy sheriffs visited the school and read
the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought it was serious enough to act on,'' said Chance
Allen, the principal.
</P>
<P>
   Beamon was taken downtown and made an appearance before Juvenile
Court Judge Darlene Whitten. Two assistant district attorney's
outlined the case against him, and the judge ordered him jailed.
The judge would not comment on the case, but Short said Beamon was
held without bail and a hearing on his case was not scheduled until
Nov. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``That judge was stupid,'' said Jason Ziedenburg, a policy
analyst at the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice in
Washington, D.C. ``But this kind of stuff is happening all over the
country. It's not just in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the school shootings at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., and Jonesboro, Ark., he said, there has been a
surge of expulsions and suspensions of students. Administrators, he
said, are more eager to involve the courts in cases that should be
handled by counselors.
</P>
<P>
   School shooting deaths have not increased since 1992, he said,
and children are safer in school than at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Educators have to have the highest standards,'' Ziedenburg
said. ``The easiest thing is to transfer their problems to the
criminal justice system. That is the lowest possible standard.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time Beamon was jailed, the judge appointed an attorney,
Kimberly McCary, to represent him and she was preparing a writ
seeking his release when Short was contacted by the boy's mother.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was outraged by what he heard and he called McCary
and told her, ``The world doesn't respond to writs of habeas
corpus, it responds to pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Short then contacted a Dallas television reporter and told him,
``I've got something you're going to be very interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, with reporters pouring into his office, Denton
County District Attorney Bruce Isaacks denied knowing anything
about the Beamon case. He later said he was not going to prosecute,
and the teen-ager was released.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like a year ago, a big ol' long year,'' Beamon said
as left the Juvenile Detention Center, wearing the clothes he had
worn for five days, and hungry for a burrito.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was crazy,'' said his mother, Jan Beamon.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Judge Whitten would not discuss the Beamon case,
but she said, ``There is some justification for parents to be
worried. Are we overreacting? This kind of thing merits serious
consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his English assignment has already cost him five days
of freedom, Ponder's school superintendent indicated in his written
statement Wednesday that the case may not be closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school is reviewing the matter and planning a hearing ...
with the Beamons to provide Chris with a chance to state his side
of this matter,'' his statement said. ``At that time, any
disciplinary actions by the district will be decided.''
</P>
<P>
   One tangent to the case provoked as much outrage as the jailing
of the teen-ager. It was widely reported that he received an ``A''
for his story, which was rife with misspellings and grammatical
errors, plus 100 bonus points for reading it in class.
</P>
<P>
   Not true, said Principal Allen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teacher never graded that paper,'' he said. ``She asked if
anyone wanted to read their story in class and one of the students
asked if they would get extra points.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she would give 100 bonus points to anyone who read
their story. She had not even read Chris' story. He got a grade for
the oral presentation, not for the story itself.''
</P>

CHARTER VOTE LOSS SHOWS EROSION OF SUPPORT FOR GIULIANI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Republicans here woke up Wednesday with a startling
thought: In the election for the US Senate, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
could lose his own city more lopsidedly than anyone has imagined
and that, therefore, the race statewide is going to be
nerve-rackingly close.
</P>
<P>
   The event that triggered this notion was a referendum on
changing the City Charter, New York City's constitution. Giuliani
had pushed the reform as a vote of confidence in the legacy of his
two terms as mayor. Yet the measure lost by a resounding 76-24
margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake,'' said one Manhattan lawyer who has contact
with Democratic and Republican politicians, ``this was a major
defeat for the mayor. People voted against it as a statement
against the mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite by coincidence, Giuliani's Senate campaign managers
broadcast their first TV ads Wednesday _ in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   The ad had been planned some time ago, but the timing reinforces
what many predict as a pattern in the race _ that Hillary Rodham
Clinton will win New York City, Giuliani will win the suburbs, and
the brunt of the contest will take place in the rest of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upstate'' tends to be more Republican and conservative than
New York City, but Giuliani is still not well-known there, and the
city that he has governed is commonly viewed as foreign, even
hostile, territory.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second ad shows the mayor amid hardhat workers, retired
people, a shoeshine man, and crowds of smiling faces, as a narrator
talks about how he made the city safe, created jobs, cut taxes, and
replaced welfare with work. The voice concludes, ``Rudy _ ready to
do even more for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   One politico who has seen the ad said, ``This is his way of
introducing himself in a place where he needs to win very badly.''
</P>
<P>
   A common calculation is that if Giuliani wins only one-third of
New York City's vote, he could still win statewide by capturing
Republicans in the rest of the state. However, if he falls below
one-third in the city, he needs to win elsewhere by extra-large
margins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuesday's vote tells me he might not get one-third of his own
city,'' said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, a City Charter referendum would have no
significance. Few care about such matters and, even in this case,
only 11 percent of the city's eligible voters bothered to cast
their ballots Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said the turnout was so low that the vote cannot be
said to mean anything.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani was the one who devised the reform, put it on a
ballot, and campaigned heavily for its passage.
</P>
<P>
   In mailings, pamphlets, and pre-recorded phone calls, sent out
all over the city, the mayor said it would ``help to assure that
the gains that we have made in the last five years . . . will
continue'' after he has left office.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the call for a big vote of approval was denied.
</P>
<P>
   The contents of the reform had nothing that would arouse such
opposition _ a package of 14 measures including no-gun zones around
schools, a requirement that gun owners use trigger-locks, and a
rule that would make it harder for the City Council to raise income
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   However, when Giuliani proposed creating a Charter Commission
last June, he did so for another purpose _ to ensure that Mark
Green, a Democrat who holds the job of New York City public
advocate, would not become mayor if Giuliani won the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate election takes place next November, but the next
mayoral election will not happen until November 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Under an obscure provision of the charter, the public advocate
steps to the helm if the mayor leaves office before his term is up.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani views Green as the embodiment of the brand of
liberalism that he has tried to wipe out during the past five
years, and people around the mayor say it deeply frustrates him
that winning the Senate race would mean watching his arch-rival
succeed him as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   When word spread last summer of what Giuliani was up to, the
whole city cried foul. Not just Democrats _ many of whom don't like
Green anyway _ but even the mayor's allies said it was unfair, and
possibly unlawful, to change the charter just to halt the advance
of a personal enemy.
</P>
<P>
   The Charter Commission, which Giuliani packed with close
supporters, did end up recommending a change in the rules of
succession _ a special election to take place within 60 days of a
mayoral vacancy _ but it would not go into effect until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   But many politically aware New Yorkers had come to view the
whole reform process as a sham and were determined to vote no as a
protest against Giuliani's tactics.

NO OBVIOUS EXPLANATIONS FOR HONOLULU GUNMAN'S DEADLY RAMPAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU _ He lived on Easy Street, a one-block dead end in the
green hills above town. He raised prize carp and goldfish in
homemade tanks, and built fine furniture by hand. And he also
collected weapons, as many as 19 by official count: a dozen
handguns, 5 rifles and 2 shotguns, each apparently registered as
required by law.
</P>
<P>
   But none of his neighbors could say just what made Byran
Uyesugi, a quiet, 40-year-old copy machine repairman for Xerox
Corp., methodically gun down seven of his co-workers on Tuesday
morning in the worst mass murder in the state's history. The
Honolulu Advertiser's headline Wednesday morning was ``Tragedy in
Paradise,'' and in a city that recorded only 17 homicides in all of
last year, that sentiment seemed more than just a journalistic
cliche.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very quiet, a nice boy,'' said Dorothy Kameda, 78, who
has lived across the street from the Uyesugi family in the Nuuanu
Valley neighborhood for more than 30 years. ``Whatever he did, he
did it well. He made beautiful furniture. When I needed help, he
always came over. I never saw a mad face. He was always smiling.''
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday morning, as neighborhood roosters crowed and
Uyesugi's outdoor fish tanks gurgled, his father, Hiroyuki, a
retired postman, came to the screen door of the small frame
bungalow they shared, his face a trembling mask of pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry, I can't say anything,'' the elder Uyesugi said,
gesturing helplessly. ``My lawyer tells me not to say anything.
He's trying to build a foundation, and if I say the wrong thing, he
can't.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, as police officers surrounded Byran Uyesugi in a
five-hour standoff before his brother, Dennis, helped persuade him
to surrender, the anguished father explained to waiting reporters
what his own honorable instincts dictated: ``I'm going to bring him
another gun so he can shoot himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Uyesugi, whose parents emigrated here from Japan, told
reporters Tuesday that, four or five years ago, his son had kicked
an elevator door at work, argued with a supervisor and then been
required to undergo two weeks of anger-management counseling. In
1985, Byran Uyesugi was convicted of driving under the influence of
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   But it was far less clear what might have prompted Uyesugi to
burst in on a staff meeting in a murderous rage, then flee in a
company van to a neighborhood near a nature preserve, where a
passing jogger spotted him and alerted police.
</P>
<P>
   Some local media reports quoted an unidentified neighbor as
saying Hiroyuki Uyesugi had told them his son was worried about
being laid off from his job, where he had worked for 15 years. Last
year, Xerox announced plans to lay off 10 percent of its work force
to cut costs. But the company said it had had no plans for any
change in the duties of Uyesugi, who regularly repaired copiers in
various offices in the State Capitol, including those of Gov.
Benjamin Cayetano.
</P>
<P>
   Cayetano ordered the state flag to be flown at half-mast in
honor of the shooting victims.
</P>
<P>
   At the scene of the shooting, in a warehouse-style building near
Honolulu International Airport, passers-by draped leis over a wall
at the entrance, and the building remained closed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The victims, one manager and the rest repair technicians like
Uyesugi, were identified as Melvin Lee, 58; Ron Kawamae, 54; Ron
Kataoka, 50; Peter Mark, 46; Ford Kanehira, 41; John Sakamoto, 36;
and Jason Balatico, 33.
</P>
<P>
   Five were killed in a conference room and two other bodies were
found nearby. All had been shot with a 9 mm handgun at close range,
the authorities said. Police found 20 9 mm shell casings at the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Uyesugi (pronounced yoo-SOO-ghee) remained in police custody
Wednesday, pending his expected arraignment Friday on one count of
first-degree murder and seven counts of second-degree murder, said
Peter Carlisle, the prosecuting attorney for the city and county of
Honolulu. The first-degree murder charge, triggered by the
intentional killing of more than one person, carries a sentence of
life in prison without the possibility of parole. Hawaii has no
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Carlisle said that investigators still knew of no motive for the
killings and said he had no indication that Uyesugi had made any
statements about the case. Police declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible day, and it's something that we just don't
have,'' Carlisle said.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox president and chief executive G. Richard Thoman arrived in
Honolulu from a European business trip Wednesday morning to meet
with employees and families of the victims, said company spokesman
Jeffrey Simek, who added that Xerox would pay the funeral expenses
for the dead employees and help arrange counseling for their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Simek said there was ``no basis or foundation'' for any
suggestion that Uyesugi's job had been at risk, although he has now
been officially dismissed. Simek declined to say whether other
employees had reported any signs of disgruntlement in Uyesugi
before the shootings, noting police had asked the company not to
say anything about the details of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Wong, the president of the Hawaii Goldfish and Carp
Association, of which Uyesugi was a member, recalled his friend of
three years as ``a pretty quiet person, but not antisocial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say he's super-friendly, but I can't say he's an
isolationist, either,'' said Wong, who marveled at Uyesugi's
ability to care for nearly 2,000 fish, many of them in four
300-gallon plastic tanks in his backyard. ``He doesn't mind the
social aspects of our meetings. He can make conversation. As far as
I'm concerned, there was nothing abnormal that would lead me to
believe that he was on the edge of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Candace Kelsey, a legislative clerk in the research office of
the House minority in the Hawaii state Legislature, often called on
Uyesugi to repair the overworked copier that serves the research
request of that chamber's 12 Republican members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a very difficult copier to work with, and he even had a
little sense of humor about it and would take time to explain to me
the little things that went wrong,'' Ms. Kelsey said Wednesday.
``Sometimes I'd call him every day. He was in no way hot-tempered,
and showed no signs of anger. But we never really talked on a
personal level.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kelsey said she had last seen Uyesugi about two months ago,
because the copier had not been busy during the Legislature's
recess. As it happens, she learned of the shootings while she was
making copies and her husband phoned to tell her. At first she
thought it was a joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then when I finally realized it was him, I guess I broke down
a little,'' she said. ``You can't imagine that you know somebody
who could do something like that. Everyone is searching for
answers, but none of us really have them.''

BACTERIA CASES IN DENMARK CAUSE ANTIBIOTICS CONCERNS IN U.S.
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Denmark, Mass., Britain, France, Germany)  (rk) 
 By DENISE GRADY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   An outbreak of severe, drug-resistant salmonella infections in
27 people in Denmark, traced to meat from infected pigs, is being
described by American scientists as a warning on what could happen
in the United States unless steps are taken to limit the use of
antibiotics in farm animals.
</P>
<P>
   The episode in Denmark, in which 11 people were hospitalized and
two of them died, is especially worrisome because the bacteria had
made them partly resistant to a class of antibiotics called
fluoroquinolones that doctors had considered one of their most
powerful weapons against severe cases of salmonella and other
bacteria that infect the intestinal tract. If those bacteria invade
the bloodstream, which occurs in 3 percent to 10 percent of
salmonella cases, the illness can be fatal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fluoroquinolones become a drug of last resort for some of
these infections,'' said Dr. Stuart Levy, director of the Center
for Adaptation Genetics and Drug Resistance at Tufts University.
``If we're beginning to lose these drugs, where do we go from
here?''
</P>
<P>
   Fluoroquinolones are the most recently approved class of
antibiotics; nothing comparable is expected to become available for
several years.
</P>
<P>
   Salmonella that are resistant to fluoroquinolones have not been
detected in the United States although they have turned up in
Britain, France and Germany, as well as Denmark. But, ``resistance
is a global issue,'' said Dr. Stephen F. Sundlof, director of the
center for veterinary medicine at the Food and Drug Administration,
which regulates the use of antibiotics in livestock and poultry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It potentially has an impact on everybody because of the
global nature of trade in foodstuffs, or people carrying organisms
into other countries,'' Sundlof said.
</P>
<P>
   Fluoroquinolones are used in Denmark to treat some illnesses in
pigs, and the Danish researchers who studied the outbreak suggested
that such use might have fostered the growth of resistant bacteria,
which then entered the food supply. The outbreak, which occurred
last year, is being reported Thursday in The New England Journal of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Giving fluoroquinolones to pigs is not permitted in the United
States, but the drugs are used to treat sick cows on an individual
basis, and they are given in drinking water to entire flo
20,000 to 40,000 chickens or turkeys if any bird appears ill.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that the use of antibiotics in livestock may be
contributing to the emergence of resistant bacteria that cause
infections in people that are hard to cure, the Food and Drug
Administration is revising its guidelines for approving and
monitoring the use of the drugs in animals.
</P>
<P>
   Sundlof said that the strain of salmonella that made people sick
in Denmark, known as DT104, was already resistant to five other
antibiotics and that its incidence in this country had been rising.
A study last year by researchers from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention found it in 34 percent of salmonella cases
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Fred Angulo, an epidemiologist in the food-borne and
diarrheal disease branch at the centers, said
fluroquinolone-resistant strains of another type of bacteria,
campylobacter, began to turn up in people soon after the drugs were
approved for use in poultry.
</P>
<P>
   But John Keeling, a spokesman for the Animal Health Institute in
Washington, a trade group representing makers of veterinary drugs,
said it was yet to be proved that the use of fluoroquinolone in
animals had any connection to the illnesses in people.

EVERYBODY GETS BURNED IN `THE INDSIDER' 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: for use Friday, Nov. 5 or thereafter) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Director Michael Mann has a reputation for
pugnacity. But even this hard-nosed Chicago guy, who created TV's
``Miami Vice'' and such films as ``Thief'' and ``Heat,'' seems
weary of the controversy that's dogged his latest movie, the
critically acclaimed ``The Insider.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me while I go to sleep,'' the 56-year-old Mann jokes
when asked, for the umpteenth time, to respond to complaints lodged
by ``60 Minutes'' producer Don Hewitt and correspondent Mike
Wallace about ``The Insider,'' which details the infamous tobacco
industry whistle-blower expose that damaged the venerable news
program's own hard-hitting reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to ask a filmmaker who has spent two years making a
motion picture _ which is NOT about `60 Minutes' _ to react to the
misguided, and I think somewhat obsessive concern about self-image
of some secondary characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Secondary characters who are, nevertheless, the recognizable
celebrities in a long, complicated story steeped in scientific,
legal and ethical minutiae.
</P>
<P>
   The film can't even be synopsized quickly. But basically, ``60
Minutes'' investigative reporter and segment producer Lowell
Bergman, who is played by Al Pacino, thought he had the scoop of
the decade when he convinced Jeffrey Wigand, the
ex-research-and-development head of the Brown &AMP; Williamson tobacco
company, to spill everything he knew about Big Tobacco in a taped
interview with Wallace. This included contradicting tobacco CEOs'
congressional testimony that they did not believe cigarettes were
addictive and revelations of nicotine-level manipulations that made
their products harder to kick.
</P>
<P>
   Before the segment aired, however, B&AMP;W threatened the show's
network, CBS, with potentially devastating lawsuits. ``60 Minutes''
was faced with sacrificing journalistic integrity to corporate
pressure. The CBS lawyers _ and, by extension, B&AMP;W _ won the first
round; a watered-down segment that did not mention Wigand's name,
show his face or include his most devastating revelations, was
broadcast, accompanied by Wallace's denunciation of his network's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   A fuller version of the interview was aired later, when it was
safe; Wigand's deposition in the case that eventually resulted in
the states' attorneys general's $246 billion judgment against the
tobacco industry had been leaked to the press and at that point was
public record.
</P>
<P>
   The film depicts Bergman's efforts to get the segment aired and
protect his source _ and with all the power never-before-beaten Big
Tobacco had to throw at the former,
confidentiality-agreement-breaking employee, Wigand was in a
horrendously vulnerable position _ while processing his own
feelings of betrayal. Wallace and Hewitt are shown initially siding
with their own corporate powers and agreeing to truncate the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty complicated, huh? Add to that a rather iffy second
protagonist _ as played by the talented Australian actor Russell
Crowe (``L.A. Confidential''), Wigand comes off as a well-meaning
but furtive, depressive and unstable individual _ and you need a
sexy character like Wallace to goose audience interest now and
again.
</P>
<P>
   Although he hadn't seen the finished film at the time of this
writing _ Mann refused to screen it for the ``60 Minutes'' camp,
which he feels has attacked the film too severely based on what he
says were early script drafts _ Wallace has reportedly heard enough
about his portrayal to have warmed a bit toward it in recent days
(see accompanying story).
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, he couldn't ask for a more charming
doppleganger than Christopher Plummer. The accomplished Canadian
stage and screen actor, whose portrayal of Capt. Von Trapp in ``The
Sound of Music'' has endeared him to generations of moviegoers,
portrays Wallace with sly wit, steely intelligence, passion and,
ultimately, a solid sense of what's right and wrong. (Hewitt, on
the other hand, is set up as more of a corporate lackey; Philip
Baker Hall, the actor who plays him, reportedly has some problems
with the finished film).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he lands in a very human position,'' Plummer says of
his Wallace performance. ``If he complains that he didn't waffle _
which of course, he has admitted that he did, publicly _ it doesn't
matter. Why is he so worried about that? It's a very human thing to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, if I or you (thought) your career or image was going
to be shattered on the floor because some Big Brother came along
and threatened to sue you, I would pause for a second,'' adds
Plummer, who found Wallace charming and funny when they did a radio
interview many years ago. ``They only paused for a little while,
and then they changed their minds and did the right thing. What on
Earth is he complaining about? I think it's because he doesn't have
much control over this thing, and he loves control.''
</P>
<P>
   So, according to the movie, does Lowell Bergman, who left ``60
Minutes'' after the Wigand incident and now produces documentaries
for PBS and teaches at UC Berkeley. A friend of Mann's _ they met
through a mutual DEA connection when Mann executive-produced the
Emmy-winning TV miniseries ``Drug Wars: The Camarena Story'' _
Bergman supplied the key real-life player's point-of-view for ``The
Insider.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of it's absolutely right on the money,'' Bergman says of
the film, which its makers admit changes the actual sequence of
certain key events for dramatic purposes. ``Overall, it's an
accurate representation of what happened emotionally,
psychologically and in terms of the issues and the forces that were
at work at the time. It's not a documentary, though.''
</P>
<P>
   And Lowell Bergman is a much more, shall we say, sedate
personality than Al Pacino.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Al's playing you, you're glamorized on some level,''
Bergman admits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lowell does and doesn't come off as an idealized journalistic
hero in the film,'' Mann allows. ``That may be my fault. There's no
wonderful, pompous, philosophical statement; he just tells Mike at
the end, `What am I gonna tell the guy with the next tough story?
``Hang with me and you'll be fine _ maybe?'' ' Lowell does have
that integrity. But he is annoying as hell.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The surprise of the picture was that it did manage to avoid
that kind of self-righteous hero type of stuff,'' Pacino reckons.
``It's not about winners and losers, but the very nature of those
events. I thought that was unusual in this type of movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having Lowell Bergman himself as a model helped me
tremendously,'' the Oscar-winning actor admits. ``I was able to get
some of his take on the various situations that are in the picture,
and how he felt about them and where they took him. And of course,
Michael Mann's guidance kept me from beating my breast.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell Crowe did not have the luxury of similar access to his
character, Wigand. Oddly enough, the former executive's
confidentiality agreement was still in effect through much of the
film's development period, and it prevented him from cooperating
with the production in all but a tertiary manner.
</P>
<P>
   This left Crowe in the position of playing someone close to 20
years his senior who thought in scientific terms the actor could
barely imagine and who went through profound personal crises _
Wigand's second marriage and high-paying research career were
destroyed during the 1995-96 time period the film covers _ along
with profound harassment and threat of legal action from his former
employer's camp.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, he talked funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``In cinematic terms, if you speak like Jeffrey does, you're
supposed to be shoving dead bodies into the trunks of cars or
pulling stockings over your face to do the bank job,'' Crowe about
of the Bronx-bred Wigand's accent. ``So I'm like, `Michael, he
can't talk like this and be a scientist! No one's gonna believe it,
man!' And on top of that, Jeffrey hadn't worked in the tobacco
industry prior to moving to Louisville, Ky., so every word in his
vocabulary that refers to smoking is in a Southern accent.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, there were some very long conversations that we had. At
the end of the day, Michael didn't require me to impersonate Jeff
Wigand. But that just wasn't comfortable for me; it was like
saying, `Think I'll play Abraham Lincoln with a moustache.' I knew
that if I put on weight, it would help me with the age thing, then
I bleached my hair seven times. If I sat and watched this movie and
I didn't see Jeff Wigand, then I'd be shown up as not being able to
do my gig. When I finally watched it, I did see Jeff a couple of
times; that was fine for me.''
</P>
<P>
   While he certainly appreciated Crowe's performance, fine wasn't
exactly how Wigand felt when he watched ``The Insider.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie takes a lot and compresses it,'' says Wigand, whose
jumpy, intense personality bears some witness to his ordeal. ``The
fidelity of it is pretty accurate, but some of its details are
creative. For instance, the scene at the driving range (in which
Wigand is shadowed at night by a lone fellow golfer) never
happened. However, was I followed? Oh yes, most certainly. Was it
somebody employed by Brown &AMP; Williamson who was an ex-FBI agent?
Yes. Was my matrimonial attorney's office tossed? Yes. Was my
attorney in Washington, D.C.'s car broken into and her records on
me taken out? Yes. Was my briefcase taken by a Brown &AMP; Williamson
lawyer while I was giving depositions in Louisville? Yes. Does that
moment in the movie at the driving range capture all that? Yes, it
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, both the tobacco company and CBS maintain that ``The
Insider'' contains many inaccuracies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You understand, this is all public record,'' Mann says in the
film's defense. ``There's nothing here that the Columbia Journalism
Review and The New York Times and everybody else didn't cover. But
put yourself in my shoes. Eric Roth (the Oscar-winning screenwriter
of ``Forrest Gump'') and I decided we wanted to do a drama _ and
not just a docudrama. I didn't want it to be objective, I wanted to
take you on a ride being Jeffrey Wigand and Lowell Bergman, because
I know that these men got seared by this experience, and it was
tremendously dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, you're constructing a 2{-hour drama. Every minute when
I'm not intentionally engaging you from Lowell and Jeffrey's
perspectives, where I go objective, I'm diminishing my stated,
strategic attempt of how to tell it. Now that's a selective way of
telling it, but I also have to be truthful. I can't distort and be
untruthful with broad events that occurred. But it's what they
experienced, Jeffrey and Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means that Mike has to be secondary, and Hewitt has got
to be at least tertiary, that's the nature of the drama. And any of
them are all free to have told their own stories or do whatever
they want to do. But this is the picture that I chose to make.'' &QL;

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich is not in the habit of taking losses
lightly. But this one really hurt. And the pain struck close to
home.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rockets were defeated in Tuesday's referendum to authorize
the Harris County-Houston Sports Authority to help build a new
downtown arena, putting the franchise's future in Houston in
jeopardy. For Tomjanovich, who moved to Houston with the franchise
in 1971 and has never left, the loss was clearly personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I was under the wrong impression,'' he said. ``I just
thought that the Rockets and Comets were a big asset for the city.
But I guess I was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's highly disappointing when you felt you had a relationship
and it doesn't turn out to be the way you thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich would not comment about the future of the team. He
said he and Rockets owner Leslie Alexander have not discussed
Alexander's options after his Compaq Center lease ends following
the 2002-2003 season.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Tomjanovich is stunned and disappointed, not only
because of what he perceived the vote said about the Rockets but
because a deal he considered fair was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't talked anything about the future,'' Tomjanovich
said. ``We thought this was a good deal for the city. It is. It is
better than the deal that passed in San Antonio. It's better than
just about every deal we've seen for citizens. But it wasn't good
enough, so Les will have to look at his options.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just very disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich said he did not believe the issue would become a
distraction to the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will affect guys immediately,'' he said.
``There's still years on our lease.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rockets rookie Steve Francis, ``We still have to continue
to play basketball no matter what happens. Hopefully, we'll
continue to be the Houston Rockets. That's something management
will decide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough. This is something I never thought would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockets players offered another reason to believe they will not
be sidetracked by Tuesday's defeat at the polls. Likening it to
losing the first game of a playoff series, they believe there could
be a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets have announced no plans to try to go before the
public in another referendum. But they said they were not ready to
give up the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think just about everybody says they want the arena; that
question is already understood,'' center Hakeem Olajuwon said. ``We
have to go back to the table to negotiate or restructure the deal.
It's not like they don't want the arena.''
</P>
<P>
   Forward Matt Bullard, the next-most tenured member of the team,
went even further, predicting victory in a competition that so far
is not planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Houston will have a new arena,'' Bullard said. ``I
think voters just didn't have enough time to get to know what the
deal was. Next time there is a vote, I think the voters will be
more informed.''
</P>
<P>
   Comets coach Van Chancellor took a similar position. He did not
offer a reason for his optimism, but Chancellor did not take the
defeat as personally as Tomjanovich and was not ready to concede
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some way, somehow, we'll get all this stuff worked
out,'' Chancellor said. ``I believe in positive thinking. You can't
win a championship unless you think you're going to win one. I
think we're going to be in Houston and have an arena one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really disappointed for ownership. They thought this was
something they really, really needed for the Rockets and us for the
next 30 years. I'm really, really disappointed for all of us. I
don't think they (the voters) thought Rockets and Comets. They
thought other thoughts. I don't know what they were thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the voters' motivation, the results were not close. But
Bullard said another referendum to keep the Rockets and Comets,
teams that have won the city's only championships in the top-level
professional leagues, could have a greater sense of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston was able to have a championship (in 1994), and
everyone in Houston was able to feel like a champion,'' Bullard
said. ``The Rockets won it again in '95, and that's only four years
ago. The Rockets' fans are great fans. I just don't think they were
well enough informed on the deal. The basketball arena deal was a
better deal than the baseball or football deals. I think if the
fans were better informed, the fans would have said, `Hey, man,
baseball and football (took advantage of) us, and the basketball
arena is the best deal out there.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole city of Houston should be proud of the Rockets and
Comets. That's five championships. The whole city should be proud
whether you're a fan or not. You should feel like you want to keep
them around a long time. When you go around the league and see the
arenas, you say, `Wow, these arenas are really fine.' Houston needs
an arena like that. The city of Houston learned its lesson with
football. If you give a team a chance to leave, it will leave. I
don't think the people of Houston are going to let their basketball
teams get away.''
</P>
<P>
   The only Rockets player who can be considered a member of ``the
people of Houston'' was saddened by the turn of events. Guard Bryce
Drew is the only Harris County resident on the team (the rest of
the players live outside Harris County or have not yet moved since
joining the Rockets). Like Tomjanovich, he believed the
relationship between the teams and the town was strong enough to
pass the referendum, making the prospect of the Rockets and Comets
leaving Houston even more difficult to accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the NBA is really putting pressure on the Rockets and
the city to have a new arena,'' Drew said. ``It is disappointing
this vote was turned down. Houston is a great city. They've won two
championships; the Comets have won three. It's a shame it's in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get out in the community and do a lot. We've always had
great fan support. The city has always embraced us. It's sad to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also difficult to understand, increasing Tomjanovich's
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the reason,'' he said. ``All I know is the
result. And the result is not good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baffling. Really baffling.''
</P>

NASDAQ PASSES 3,000, SETTING A RECORD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Nasdaq composite index began in February 1971, an
attempt to get attention for the small stocks that traded in the
then-new Nasdaq market of what had been known as over-the-counter
stocks. The index, set at 100 when it was introduced, took 12 years
to triple to 300.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, that index, now featuring some of the largest and
hottest stocks in the world, closed above 3,000 for the first time.
It took less than four-and-a-half years to triple after it first
reached 1,000. It added 1,000 points in only 16 months after first
reaching 2,000 in the summer of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   It is the computer revolution that has remade Nasdaq. That
revolution produced the large companies that now dominate the
Nasdaq composite and allowed it to rise far more rapidly than other
indexes _ even though most Nasdaq stocks have not done well
recently. Computers have allowed the fevered day trading that has
increased the volatility of Nasdaq trading to record levels.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the total value of stocks traded on Nasdaq amounts to
$3.7 trillion. The Nasdaq composite index is weighted by market
capitalization, and a third of it now is accounted for by just five
of the 4,842 companies in the index _ Microsoft, Intel, Cisco
Systems, MCI-Worldcom and Qualcomm.
</P>
<P>
   The dominance of a handful of large, well-performing stocks has
changed the character of Nasdaq and enhanced its image. When Nasdaq
began, it was taken for granted that successful companies would
eventually leave it to move to the New York Stock Exchange, much as
good baseball players are promoted from the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Nasdaq has three of the five companies with the highest
value in the country, with Microsoft first, Intel third and Cisco
fifth. Only General Electric (second) and Wal-Mart Stores (fourth)
are on the Big Board.
</P>
<P>
   For years the Nasdaq market, which is operated by the National
Association of Securities Dealers, grew despite increasing evidence
that investors were often not well served by the trading methods
employed at Nasdaq. That market relies on numerous market-makers,
rather than one specialist, for each stock. But after a scandal
produced evidence that market-makers had been colluding to force
investors to pay higher trading costs than was necessary, the
Securities and Exchange Commission forced reforms that gave
investors a much better break.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all the hot initial public offerings of recent years
have been of stocks listed on Nasdaq. That has been especially true
of Internet companies, whose performances have stunned Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the performance of various stock indexes in the 16
months since the Nasdaq composite hit 2,000. It is up 51 percent,
but the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
are each up only 14 percent. The New York Stock Exchange composite,
which includes every stock on the Big Board, has gained only 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the Nasdaq composite is up 38 percent,
compared with rises of 10 percent for the S&AMP;P 500 and 4 percent for
the Big Board composite index.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, such superior Nasdaq performance would have
been seen as an indication that small stocks were on the move. But
lately the exact opposite is the case. The Russell 2,000 index _
composed of the 2,000 stocks that rank below the 1,000 stocks with
the highest capitalization in the United States _ is the best
measure of small stock performance. During the period the Nasdaq
composite rose 51 percent, the Russell 2,000 fell 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   What is up?
</P>
<P>
   The big Nasdaq stocks are generally doing very well. The Nasdaq
computer companies _ a category that includes Internet plays as
well as hardware and software companies _ are also rising rapidly.
Nasdaq counts just 765 of its listings, or 16 percent, as computer
companies. But they now account for half the entire value of the
index.
</P>
<P>
   The telecommunications companies, led by MCI-Worldcom, accounts
for 5 percent of the companies and 17.5 percent of the value on
Nasdaq. Together with computers, those two sectors account for
two-thirds of the value but just one-fifth of the companies.
</P>
<P>
   What that means is that as Nasdaq celebrates its latest
milestone, it is a party that is being enjoyed by a small minority
of the companies traded on the market. In all probability, the
performance of the Nasdaq composite is not being matched by many
investors, even among those who specialize in Nasdaq stocks.
</P>
<P>
   As computer and Internet stocks have created great excitement,
they have driven up the averages even though many _ in some cases
most _ of their shares are held by insiders and are not available
for public trading. Most stock market indexes, including the Nasdaq
indexes, weight the value of each company in the index based on its
overall market value _ not on the market value available to public
investors. Nearly all the shares of many dull performers are owned
by the public, while few of the shares of the hot companies are so
owned.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that relatively few shares of the hottest companies are
available for trading may be a cause of rising volatility.
Volatility in the Nasdaq market is now far greater than at any time
in history. So far this year, the Nasdaq market has chalked up 54
trading days _ one in every four _ when the index closed up or down
at least 2 percent from the prior session. By contrast, there were
66 such days during the entire 15 years from 1975 through 1989 _ a
period that included the 1987 crash.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was relatively calm, with the Nasdaq composite gaining
46.88 points, or 1.6 percent, to 3,028.51.
</P>
<P>
   The fevered action has no doubt proved a lure for some stock
traders as the rise of Internet-based trading has made it possible
for individual investors to trade at a feverish pace while paying
commissions that are a small fraction of what would have been
charged even a couple of years ago. There are no statistics
available, but there is no doubt that the vast majority of stocks
traded by day traders are listed on Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   If the Internet fever were to cool, and if the extraordinary
valuations accorded to such companies as Microsoft and Cisco were
to come down, it could appear that Nasdaq had fallen into a deep
bear market. Perhaps, that would be as incomplete a picture as is
provided by the current soaring value of the Nasdaq composite
index.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the lesson that many investors have learned is a
simple one: Buy technology, particularly large and successful
technology companies and those that appear to be in the lead in a
sector of the new Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
   While doing it, don't spend too much time worrying about
valuations. That leaves some longtime stock market investors _
particularly those who remember the 1970s _ cringing. But the fact
the Nasdaq composite is now above 3,000 is just one more piece of
evidence that the strategy is working.

 &HT;    Indians' support for Teresa's sainthood lives on
 &HT;    By Moni Basu
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALCUTTA, India _ Every Monday, without fail, Terence Thomas
goes to the Missionaries of Charity to pray in front of Mother
Teresa's tomb.
</P>
<P>
   It is a sanctuary of peace amid the din and bustle of central
Calcutta.
</P>
<P>
   Like everything else in her life, Mother Teresa's final resting
place is without extravagance. The noise from the busy A.J.C. Bose
Road wafts in through the shuttered windows to the spartan hall
with poured concrete floors. Even the tomb is made from a slab of
simple white concrete _ only the small headstone is white marble. A
solitary candle burns atop her tomb, next to her Bible and a
bouquet of red roses.
</P>
<P>
   On the otherwise bare walls, a bulletin board displays a
handwritten account of Mother Teresa's life accompanied by a few
photographs. There are no signs of the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize, fame
or sainthood here. Just an ordinary tomb for an extraordinary
woman.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, 28, says he finds comfort in this room, as curious
visitors and tourists circle around him and others who are here to
pray. ``She deserves to be a saint,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That decision lies ultimately with the Vatican, but in July, the
first part of a three-phase inquiry was launched to gather evidence
of Mother Teresa's holiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are only a few months into the process and it'll take a
good while yet _ at least a year or two, could be more,'' said the
Rev. Brian Kolodiejchuk, a Canadian priest who is the postulator of
the Diocesan Inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Teresa died two years ago at age 87, after spending a
lifetime helping the poor and destitute. Pope John Paul II, who
will begin a four-day visit to India on Friday, waived the
five-year waiting period that is customary for a person's
declaration as a saint.
</P>
<P>
   But before any such declaration can be made, two ``miracles''
attributed to Mother Teresa have to be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Kolodiejchuk said a panel is looking into Mother Teresa's
miracles, 99 percent of which are medical in nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``By medical miracles we mean a cure or healing for which there
is no scientific explanation,'' Kolodiejchuk said. ``It's going to
be very difficult because she was an international figure. But for
me it's a privilege to be able to do this. I am getting to know her
better.''
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop of Calcutta, the Rev. Henry De Souza, has
described a patient in the West Bengal town of Raiganj who claimed
a tumor disappeared after receiving blessings from Mother Teresa.
That case has apparently been authenticated by a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Two other reported miracles have already been sent to the
Vatican for verification. A French woman who was in a car accident
in the United States says she was healed after she wore a Mother
Teresa medallion around her neck. In another case, a Palestinian
girl suffering from cancer says she was cured after Mother Teresa
appeared in her dreams and said, ``Child, you are cured.''
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry team has been sworn to secrecy, so Kolodiejchuk
would not talk in detail about his investigation. But the panel
will look into 60 reported miracles in Calcutta and 40 more all
over the world, including Rome, London, New York and San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this stage we are using two main sources of information _
oral/eyewitnesses and documents gathered by a historical
commission,'' Kolodiejchuk said.
</P>
<P>
   One story the panel is examining involves a Hindu businessman
who once came to Mother Teresa's house to give her a ride in his
car. Just as she was getting into the car, she said, ``I forgot to
tell him I was leaving.'' She went back into the house and in a few
minutes came back out. ``Him,'' of course, was Jesus. Kolodiejchuk
said this was an example of Mother Teresa's shared personal
intimacy with Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Teresa, an ethnic Albanian born in Skopje, Macedonia, was
a staunch Catholic. Only 3 percent of India's 1 billion people are
Christians, but most Calcuttans, regardless of their religion,
support the canonization. Along the narrow lane that is home to the
Missionaries of Charity, the order of nuns founded by Mother
Teresa, that support is even more overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``She deserves sainthood,'' said Abdul Halim, a 48-year-old
Muslim who owns and operates Eagle Motor Works next to the mission.
``She did nothing for herself. She devoted her whole life to poor
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Halim said he knew Mother Teresa when she had nothing and used
to give her rides in one of the cars from his garage. Now he
carries with him a small yellow card that on one side has a prayer
by Mother Teresa. Following Mother Teresa's death, the area was
closed to the public and the card was issued to residents to enter
the lane. ``It's my souvenir,'' he said, tucking the weathered card
back into his pocket address book.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad Mohiuddin, 56, and also a Muslim, owns a light bulb
factory directly across from the mission. He said when his
father-in-law was sick, Mother Teresa delivered medicine to him.
When Mohiuddin was involved in a scooter accident, she arranged for
an ambulance to take him to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few days before she died, she had a photo taken with all of
us, the people in her neighborhood. It was her birthday,''
Mohiuddin said. ``She did so much for us. She should be a saint.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are some in India, including the radical Hindu
Vishwa Parishad, or World Hindu Council, who have accused the
Vatican of rushing sainthood for Mother Teresa in order to
encourage Christian missionary activity in India. The Hindu council
has led a campaign to stop missionaries who, it alleges, are
forcing poor Indians to convert by enticing them with food and aid.
Within the last few years, there have been several incidents of
violence against Christians, including the death of Australian
missionary Graham Stewart Staines, who last January was burned
alive with his two sons.
</P>
<P>
   Hindu militants say they will use the papal visit this week to
press demands for an end to Christian conversions. Hindu anger has
also raised security concerns and scuttled plans for the pontiff to
visit Calcutta and the former Portuguese enclave of Goa, a bastion
of Christianity in India.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those Hindus who say the Christians in India are being paid to
convert are totally wrong,'' Halim said. ``There was never any
pressure for us to convert. I am a Muslim. Mother Teresa was a
Christian. What difference does it make? She helped so many
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Suresh Chowdhary, 37, was taught by nuns from the mission when
he was young. Now, he makes a few rupees here and there by ironing
clothes. He steps out of his thatched-roof hut and considers what
he would be had Mother Teresa not been a stone's throw away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would survive maybe. But things would be very different,''
said Chowdhary, whose family continues to receive food and rations
from the nuns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a Hindu, but I never looked at Mother Teresa differently.
She cared for the homeless, the children. She should be considered
God, what else.''
</P>
<P>
   Chowdhary pauses for a moment and raises his arms up in front of
him. ``Yes, I used to treat her like God. I still do.''

PROGRESS OF HEALTH CARE BILL OFFERS LESSON IN POWER POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here is how the textbooks say a bill becomes law:
The Senate passes the bill. Then the House of Representatives
passes its own version. Then a conference committee is formed,
where senior senators defend their bill and senior representatives
defend their bill, with both sides striking compromises to resolve
the differences.
</P>
<P>
   But in the real world of power politics, conventional procedures
are sometimes flouted. That is what happened in the House Wednesday
on managed-care legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, by a lopsided 275-151 vote, the House passed a bill
that would give patients a wide range of new rights in dealing with
their health insurance companies. In July, the Senate had passed a
bill covering barely a quarter as many patients and giving them a
much more limited set of rights.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill was strongly supported by President Clinton, and
almost all Democrats and 68 Republicans voted for it. But
Republican leaders in the House opposed the measure, making its
passage probably the most striking rebuff to the leadership since
the party won control of Congress in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, these leaders used their authority to make sure
the Republican conferees named to negotiate with the Senate were on
their side and not on the side that won the vote, a tactic that
could effectively stifle any action regulating managed-care plans
in this Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The chief Republican sponsor of the measure, Rep. Charlie
Norwood of Georgia, was denied a seat on the conference committee.
So was another leading Republican supporter, Rep. Greg Ganske of
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 12 Republican conferees, 10 voted against the
managed-care bill, one voted for it and one was absent.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic set off an uproar. It not only made any legislation
on managed-care plans highly unlikely, but it also led some
lawmakers to say they doubted the conference committee would ever
meet.
</P>
<P>
   John P. Feehery, a spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
said the speaker had ``followed regular order'' by appointing to
the conference committee the most senior members of the legislative
committees and subcommittees with jurisdiction. It just happened,
Feehery said, that these lawmakers were opponents of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   But to the bill's proponents, that seemed to be a lame
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech on the House floor Wednesday afternoon, Norwood, a
dentist by profession who had risked a great deal in bucking his
leaders, complained bitterly, ``Our party has no credibility on HMO
reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganske, a doctor, delivered a more personal speech. He said:
``We are both wrestlers, Mr. Speaker. One of the great things about
wrestling is that you win or lose on the mat, not by selecting the
referee. If you as coach had a referee steal a deserved victory
from one of your wrestlers, you would have lost respect for that
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, of course, were furious, their usual state of temper
nowadays when dealing with the Republicans. ``It's outrageous that
they've stacked the deck,'' said Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the
Democratic whip.
</P>
<P>
   All eight of the House Democratic conferees voted for the
legislation. The Senate conferees consist of seven Republicans who
voted for the weaker Senate bill and five Democrats who basically
favor the bill passed by the House.
</P>
<P>
   For a bill to be approved by a conference committee, it must
have the votes of a majority of the Senate conferees and a majority
of the House conferees, voting separately.
</P>
<P>
   Many outside authorities on Congress, even some sympathetic to
the Republican cause, were taken aback by Hastert's move.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Frenzel, who was a Republican representative from Minnesota
from 1971 to 1991 and who is now a scholar at the Brookings
Institution, said in an interview that he had never seen such a
maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly not the custom,'' Frenzel said. ``In some
legislatures, maybe including ours, there used to be rules.''
</P>
<P>
   But Frenzel, who suffered mightily at the hands of the
Democratic majority when he was in the House, went on to say:
``This is power hockey. I don't think even the perpetrators like to
do it, but sometimes it's necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The rules of the House state: ``In appointing members to
conference committees, the Speaker shall appoint no less than a
majority of members who generally support the House position as
determined by the Speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Technically, Hastert followed that rule. The managed-care
regulations were attached to a separate bill, which Republicans
call access legislation, that would increase coverage for the
uninsured, expand medical savings accounts and let small businesses
buy health insurance jointly. All the Republican conferees voted
for the access legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The main objection of most Republicans to the managed-care bill
passed by the House is that it would allow patients to sue their
health insurers if they had been harmed because coverage was denied
or substandard.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, the rank-and-file Republicans who feel this way
seemed to approve of Hastert's tactic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of a conference is to find a middle ground so you can
get something out,'' said Rep. Nancy L. Johnson, R-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., called the maneuver
``inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Coburn, who is also a doctor and who worked actively against the
bill that passed, said rather contemptuously, ``This is a political
ploy.''

RIDGWAY DEALS WITH DARKER SIDE ON `ANATOMY' 
</HEADLINE>

(Eds: For use Friday, Nov. 5 or thereafter) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Wall of Voodoo front man Stan Ridgway has proof that
aliens walk among us: ``Have you been to a tractor pull lately?''
</P>
<P>
   Ridgway, whose noir-pop songs can summon equal parts Raymond
Chandler, John Huston, Rod Serling and Johnny Cash, is known for a
sardonic wit and a voice to match.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 20 years, Ridgway has penned odes to loners and
losers, trigger-happy cops, other-wordly chain gangs, and Harry
Truman and the atom bomb.
</P>
<P>
   That pulp-fiction aesthetic was a crucial ingredient in Wall of
Voodoo, the forward-looking Los Angeles synth-driven band Ridgway
formed in 1978 and exited in 1983. With a sound that combined Devo
and Ennio Morricone with Ridgway's sarcastic delivery, Wall of
Voodoo scored a lone hit, ``Mexican Radio,'' which still turns up
frequently on radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a lot of great music together and played a lot of
great shows, too,'' Ridgway said. ``But after `Mexican Radio,' it
was time for me to cut out. The band thing was hard for me after a
while. I'm really more oriented as a jazz player would be, where
you play with different people in various projects.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridgway's latest solo outing, ``Anatomy'' (New West), contains a
dozen tracks dealing with the darker side of life, character
studies that resonate long after the CD player has retired for the
evening.
</P>
<P>
   The album's one cover: ``Tennessee'' Ernie Ford's 1955
chart-topper ``Sixteen Tons,'' which bears Ridgway's mix of
industrial rhythms and electronic instrumentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a coal-mining song and I've always related to the idea of
digging underground,'' Ridgway explained. ``My dad was a mining guy
and he had the record when I was growing up. I always thought it
would be great to take a more abstract approach to the song, update
the sonics and really take it outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridgway, who is married to musician-composer Pietra Wexstun,
appears Saturday at the Roxy in West Hollywood in his first local
date in 2{ years.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last few years, I've been doing more scoring for film
and TV and I think some of that texture has crept into the new
songs,'' Ridgway said. ``Songwriting has always been a way for me
to work out my feelings and obsessions about things. I've always
felt life is a mixed bag and if you can't experience a sense of
absurd irony about events in the world and in your own life, you're
simply not seeing the big picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridgway first got involved with film in 1983 when he and
ex-Police drummer Stewart Copeland penned ``Don't Box Me In'' for
Francis Ford Coppola's ``Rumble Fish.'' The two collaborated again
for John Waters' recent ``Pecker'' and more recently on a song
titled ``Free of It All'' for the forthcoming ``Simpatico,''
starring Nick Nolte and Sharon Stone from a Sam Shepard script.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really good at writing music for the usual cliched
shots,'' Ridgway offered. ``I look for projects that have an
ironic, absurdist twist.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Wall of Voodoo classics ``Mexican Radio,'' ``Lost
Weekend,'' ``Call of the West'' and a cover of Cash's ``Ring of
Fire,'' Ridgway scored airplay with such tunes as ``Camouflage,''
``The Big Heat,'' ``Drive She Said,'' ``I Wanna Be a Boss'' and
``Callin' Out to Carol,'' all from his solo albums.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still enjoy making records and I know I'll always be writing
songs, whichever way the current winds of commerce blow,'' said
Ridgway, who lives in Venice, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's always about the work itself and staying clear
about why I do it. There's not a day that goes by when I'm not
working on a song in my head.''
</P>
<P>
   The just-issued ``Anatomy'' features a three-song live EP in
Liquid Audio format, recorded on Ridgway's 1996-97 tour, with an
additional three songs available for downloading from a location
within the Liquid Audio files.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, in all you get 12 tracks in CD audio and six in Liquid
Audio,'' Ridgway crows. ``Hey, ya wanna buy a Pocket Fisherman?'' &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Director Michael Mann has a reputation for
pugnacity. But even this hard-nosed Chicago guy, who created TV's
``Miami Vice'' and such films as ``Thief'' and ``Heat,'' seems
weary of the controversy that's dogged his latest movie, the
critically acclaimed ``The Insider.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me while I go to sleep,'' the 56-year-old Mann jokes
when asked, for the umpteenth time, to respond to complaints lodged
by ``60 Minutes'' producer Don Hewitt and correspondent Mike
Wallace about ``The Insider,'' which details the infamous tobacco
industry whistle-blower expose that damaged the venerable news
program's own hard-hitting reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to ask a filmmaker who has spent two years making a
motion picture _ which is NOT about `60 Minutes' _ to react to the
misguided, and I think somewhat obsessive concern about self-image
of some secondary characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Secondary characters who are, nevertheless, the recognizable
celebrities in a long, complicated story steeped in scientific,
legal and ethical minutiae.
</P>
<P>
   The film can't even be synopsized quickly. But basically, ``60
Minutes'' investigative reporter and segment producer Lowell
Bergman, who is played by Al Pacino, thought he had the scoop of
the decade when he convinced Jeffrey Wigand, the
ex-research-and-development head of the Brown &AMP; Williamson tobacco
company, to spill everything he knew about Big Tobacco in a taped
interview with Wallace. This included contradicting tobacco CEOs'
congressional testimony that they did not believe cigarettes were
addictive and revelations of nicotine-level manipulations that made
their products harder to kick.
</P>
<P>
   Before the segment aired, however, B&AMP;W threatened the show's
network, CBS, with potentially devastating lawsuits. ``60 Minutes''
was faced with sacrificing journalistic integrity to corporate
pressure. The CBS lawyers _ and, by extension, B&AMP;W _ won the first
round; a watered-down segment that did not mention Wigand's name,
show his face or include his most devastating revelations, was
broadcast, accompanied by Wallace's denunciation of his network's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   A fuller version of the interview was aired later, when it was
safe; Wigand's deposition in the case that eventually resulted in
the states' attorneys general's $246 billion judgment against the
tobacco industry had been leaked to the press and at that point was
public record.
</P>
<P>
   The film depicts Bergman's efforts to get the segment aired and
protect his source _ and with all the power never-before-beaten Big
Tobacco had to throw at the former,
confidentiality-agreement-breaking employee, Wigand was in a
horrendously vulnerable position _ while processing his own
feelings of betrayal. Wallace and Hewitt are shown initially siding
with their own corporate powers and agreeing to truncate the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty complicated, huh? Add to that a rather iffy second
protagonist _ as played by the talented Australian actor Russell
Crowe (``L.A. Confidential''), Wigand comes off as a well-meaning
but furtive, depressive and unstable individual _ and you need a
sexy character like Wallace to goose audience interest now and
again.
</P>
<P>
   Although he hadn't seen the finished film at the time of this
writing _ Mann refused to screen it for the ``60 Minutes'' camp,
which he feels has attacked the film too severely based on what he
says were early script drafts _ Wallace has reportedly heard enough
about his portrayal to have warmed a bit toward it in recent days
(see accompanying story).
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, he couldn't ask for a more charming
doppleganger than Christopher Plummer. The accomplished Canadian
stage and screen actor, whose portrayal of Capt. Von Trapp in ``The
Sound of Music'' has endeared him to generations of moviegoers,
portrays Wallace with sly wit, steely intelligence, passion and,
ultimately, a solid sense of what's right and wrong. (Hewitt, on
the other hand, is set up as more of a corporate lackey; Philip
Baker Hall, the actor who plays him, reportedly has some problems
with the finished film).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he lands in a very human position,'' Plummer says of
his Wallace performance. ``If he complains that he didn't waffle _
which of course, he has admitted that he did, publicly _ it doesn't
matter. Why is he so worried about that? It's a very human thing to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, if I or you (thought) your career or image was going
to be shattered on the floor because some Big Brother came along
and threatened to sue you, I would pause for a second,'' adds
Plummer, who found Wallace charming and funny when they did a radio
interview many years ago. ``They only paused for a little while,
and then they changed their minds and did the right thing. What on
Earth is he complaining about? I think it's because he doesn't have
much control over this thing, and he loves control.''
</P>
<P>
   So, according to the movie, does Lowell Bergman, who left ``60
Minutes'' after the Wigand incident and now produces documentaries
for PBS and teaches at UC Berkeley. A friend of Mann's _ they met
through a mutual DEA connection when Mann executive-produced the
Emmy-winning TV miniseries ``Drug Wars: The Camarena Story'' _
Bergman supplied the key real-life player's point-of-view for ``The
Insider.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of it's absolutely right on the money,'' Bergman says of
the film, which its makers admit changes the actual sequence of
certain key events for dramatic purposes. ``Overall, it's an
accurate representation of what happened emotionally,
psychologically and in terms of the issues and the forces that were
at work at the time. It's not a documentary, though.''
</P>
<P>
   And Lowell Bergman is a much more, shall we say, sedate
personality than Al Pacino.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Al's playing you, you're glamorized on some level,''
Bergman admits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lowell does and doesn't come off as an idealized journalistic
hero in the film,'' Mann allows. ``That may be my fault. There's no
wonderful, pompous, philosophical statement; he just tells Mike at
the end, `What am I gonna tell the guy with the next tough story?
``Hang with me and you'll be fine _ maybe?'' ' Lowell does have
that integrity. But he is annoying as hell.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The surprise of the picture was that it did manage to avoid
that kind of self-righteous hero type of stuff,'' Pacino reckons.
``It's not about winners and losers, but the very nature of those
events. I thought that was unusual in this type of movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having Lowell Bergman himself as a model helped me
tremendously,'' the Oscar-winning actor admits. ``I was able to get
some of his take on the various situations that are in the picture,
and how he felt about them and where they took him. And of course,
Michael Mann's guidance kept me from beating my breast.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell Crowe did not have the luxury of similar access to his
character, Wigand. Oddly enough, the former executive's
confidentiality agreement was still in effect through much of the
film's development period, and it prevented him from cooperating
with the production in all but a tertiary manner.
</P>
<P>
   This left Crowe in the position of playing someone close to 20
years his senior who thought in scientific terms the actor could
barely imagine and who went through profound personal crises _
Wigand's second marriage and high-paying research career were
destroyed during the 1995-96 time period the film covers _ along
with profound harassment and threat of legal action from his former
employer's camp.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, he talked funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``In cinematic terms, if you speak like Jeffrey does, you're
supposed to be shoving dead bodies into the trunks of cars or
pulling stockings over your face to do the bank job,'' Crowe about
of the Bronx-bred Wigand's accent. ``So I'm like, `Michael, he
can't talk like this and be a scientist! No one's gonna believe it,
man!' And on top of that, Jeffrey hadn't worked in the tobacco
industry prior to moving to Louisville, Ky., so every word in his
vocabulary that refers to smoking is in a Southern accent.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, there were some very long conversations that we had. At
the end of the day, Michael didn't require me to impersonate Jeff
Wigand. But that just wasn't comfortable for me; it was like
saying, `Think I'll play Abraham Lincoln with a moustache.' I knew
that if I put on weight, it would help me with the age thing, then
I bleached my hair seven times. If I sat and watched this movie and
I didn't see Jeff Wigand, then I'd be shown up as not being able to
do my gig. When I finally watched it, I did see Jeff a couple of
times; that was fine for me.''
</P>
<P>
   While he certainly appreciated Crowe's performance, fine wasn't
exactly how Wigand felt when he watched ``The Insider.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie takes a lot and compresses it,'' says Wigand, whose
jumpy, intense personality bears some witness to his ordeal. ``The
fidelity of it is pretty accurate, but some of its details are
creative. For instance, the scene at the driving range (in which
Wigand is shadowed at night by a lone fellow golfer) never
happened. However, was I followed? Oh yes, most certainly. Was it
somebody employed by Brown &AMP; Williamson who was an ex-FBI agent?
Yes. Was my matrimonial attorney's office tossed? Yes. Was my
attorney in Washington, D.C.'s car broken into and her records on
me taken out? Yes. Was my briefcase taken by a Brown &AMP; Williamson
lawyer while I was giving depositions in Louisville? Yes. Does that
moment in the movie at the driving range capture all that? Yes, it
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, both the tobacco company and CBS maintain that ``The
Insider'' contains many inaccuracies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You understand, this is all public record,'' Mann says in the
film's defense. ``There's nothing here that the Columbia Journalism
Review and The New York Times and everybody else didn't cover. But
put yourself in my shoes. Eric Roth (the Oscar-winning screenwriter
of ``Forrest Gump'') and I decided we wanted to do a drama _ and
not just a docudrama. I didn't want it to be objective, I wanted to
take you on a ride being Jeffrey Wigand and Lowell Bergman, because
I know that these men got seared by this experience, and it was
tremendously dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, you're constructing a 2{-hour drama. Every minute when
I'm not intentionally engaging you from Lowell and Jeffrey's
perspectives, where I go objective, I'm diminishing my stated,
strategic attempt of how to tell it. Now that's a selective way of
telling it, but I also have to be truthful. I can't distort and be
untruthful with broad events that occurred. But it's what they
experienced, Jeffrey and Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means that Mike has to be secondary, and Hewitt has got
to be at least tertiary, that's the nature of the drama. And any of
them are all free to have told their own stories or do whatever
they want to do. But this is the picture that I chose to make.'' &QL;

AS DEMOCRACY LOSES SOME LUSTER, SO DOES A DISSIDENT TURNED
PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This article is part of the occasional One Europe, 10 Years
series on political, economic and social change in post-communist
Europe.)

<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ Vaclav Havel, the ironic dissident who
articulated the power of the powerless and helped bring down the
Berlin Wall, still serves, like a prisoner, as president of the
Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   In grandiose surroundings in Prague Castle, a pompous stage in a
city that looks like a movie set, Havel looks small and unhappy,
his warnings unheeded and his popularity ratings down.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrated in the West as a symbol of Communism's magical
implosion and the force of the written word, Havel, 10 years later,
is now regarded by many Czechs as something of a scold, or worse, a
bit of a joke.
</P>
<P>
   His deep involvement in party politics has inevitably tarnished
his moral stature. And after his revered wife, Olga, died, his
second marriage two years ago, to a former film actress who once
played a topless vampire, held him up to ridicule, which is only
now calming down.
</P>
<P>
   A famous playwright who mocked Communist conformity, obfuscatory
language and bureaucratic life, Havel was jailed soon after he
helped draft and distribute Charter 77, an anti-Communist manifesto
originally signed by only 242 people. He was an overwhelmingly
popular choice to become post-Communist Czechoslovakia's first
president in December 1989.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the arc of his career and the downsizing of his domestic
reputation, Havel himself is a metaphor for Communist Europe's
transition from epic poetry to the tedious and tawdry details of
everyday political life.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   All the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, having embraced
freedom with such high hopes, have discovered the difficulties of
economic and political transformation. Some, like Poland and
Hungary, have done better than others in forcing through necessary
change. But they have all found that freedom of speech and a free
vote do not easily translate into wealth, foreign investment or
happiness; that totalitarian habits of mind die hard and that
Western Europe, with its own divisions and economic problems, is in
no hurry to bring them into full membership in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The idolized heroes of Communism's collapse _ sometimes unlikely
leaders like Lech Walesa in Poland, Havel and even President Boris
N. Yeltsin of Russia _ have found themselves chewed apart, with
their historical reputations pitted the longer they have remained
in office.
</P>
<P>
   Havel's friends and close aides, present and former, say that he
is prone to self-doubt, that he is often miserable, that he feels
condemned to protocol and nonsense, and that he continues to act
out the role of president for the sake of the Czech people and the
state.
</P>
<P>
   One of Havel's closest friends and mentors, Zdenek Urbanek, who
helped him draft and distribute Charter 77, said: ``He has periods
when he can write terrific speeches that resemble philosophical
essays. On the other hand, sometimes he gets into a state of mind
he calls `my depressions.' But he is capable of drawing inspiration
and new strength from those depressions. I would call him a human
intellectual: he doubts himself all the time, and thanks to those
doubts he can empathize with others.''
</P>
<P>
   But that view is too simple. Havel is a witty and manipulative
man, and he is too intelligent and too much the ironist to let
himself be shoved into a role that better befits a soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   He has been a vital influence in dragging the provincial Czech
Republic into a new world of collective responsibility, of NATO
membership and candidacy to join the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview here, Havel, slightly bored when asked questions
about the 10th anniversary of the fall of the wall, suggested that
disappointment with him was the fault of those who had idealized
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without striving for it, I became a character in a story, in a
fairy tale,'' he said. ``I was awarded honorary degrees at
universities around the world and at every one of those ceremonies
I had to listen to the story of my life. And those biographies were
always the same fairy tale.''
</P>
<P>
   That story is of ``an ordinary Czech guy,'' Honza, known as
``foolish Honza,'' who keeps banging his head against an immovable
wall. ``But one day he breaks through the wall and defeats that
monster on the other side, the monster against whom Honza was not
supposed to have a chance,'' Havel said. ``And the great majority
of the Czech population and a great many foreign journalists
believed in this fairy tale.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, 10 years later, he said, ``they are beginning to wake up
from this dream, and instead of being angry with themselves for
falling asleep, they are angry with the character from their
dream.'' He laughed softly, playing with a business card instead of
smoking the cigarettes that nearly killed him with lung cancer
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my fault that I became a character in someone's
dream,'' he said. ``Neither is it my fault that the person woke
up.''
</P>
<P>
   When told by an interviewer that his explanation was a most
extraordinary bit of self-absolution, Havel said nothing, but
laughed delightedly.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Havel, now 63, nearly died again in the spring of 1998 from an
intestinal blockage. In some ways, he does not really care any more
what people think, he said, and never reads articles or books about
himself.

 PRAGUE, Czech Republic: about himself.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early days, Havel fed his legend. His slogan during the
revolution was ``May truth and love triumph over lies and hatred.''
As president, he indulged in romantic excesses like acquiring
theatrical uniforms for the presidential guards, riding a child's
scooter through the halls of the castle, inviting rock stars for
virtual state visits, boozing with old buddies and hanging lots of
modern and sometimes explicit art on the palace walls.
</P>
<P>
   Havel is right to mock the idealized picture of an apolitical
playwright exemplifying the nation from above, says Jiri Pehe, a
former Havel aide and ongoing adviser who is now the director of
the Prague branch of New York University.
</P>
<P>
   Havel is an active player in Czech politics and has sometimes
made severe mistakes. Two years ago, when he sharply attacked
former Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus in a public speech _ his private
distaste for the arrogant and conservative Klaus is no secret _
Havel's ratings dropped and his maneuver backfired.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Klaus is still a vital player in Czech politics and has
his eye on becoming prime minister again _ and president, after
Havel goes or dies.
</P>
<P>
   But Havel has also used his presidency for difficult moral and
political ends that have cut across the grain of Czech conformity
and insularity. In doing so, he has developed strong relationships
with Western leaders _ including President Clinton _ who have
relied on Havel to help keep NATO together and the world's eye on
the real moral issues of Kosovo and collective defense.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Havel himself says he has tried to drag the Czechs _ who have
been political subjects of Austria-Hungary, Nazi Germany and then
Moscow for most of the last 480 years _ out of their
``provincialism.'' The point, he says, is to get them to understand
that they are in control of their own destiny and also part of a
wider European and trans-Atlantic world of shared responsibility
and even shared sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   He is the person most responsible for pushing the Czech Republic
into NATO in the first round of expansion. He worked extremely hard
to overcome Czech skepticism and reluctance to take part in NATO's
bombing of Serbia in the conflict over Kosovo _ getting the
Parliament to pass necessary legislation allowing NATO planes
overflight rights. He was an early, outspoken advocate for using
force against the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, which was
not popular at home.
</P>
<P>
   He has bitterly attacked Czech bias against the Roma, or
Gypsies, and once said he would resign if a wall went up in the
northern Czech town of Usti nad Labem to ghettoize the Gypsies. The
wall went up on Oct. 13, and he criticized it again but did not
resign.
</P>
<P>
   He has excoriated the government and the nation for not moving
quickly enough to transform society to prepare for membership in
the European Union, which has singled out Prague for lagging behind
other, more eager applicants.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 28, while marking the 81st anniversary of Czech
statehood, Havel said the country was at a crossroads probably more
fundamental than 10 years ago, when Communism was toppled in what
the Czechs call the Velvet Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we are at such a crossroads only today, 10 years later,
because only now we face an utterly free decision about which
direction to take,'' Havel said. ``Our current dilemma is, do we
believe in an unprecedented historical, spiritual, political and
economic sense of European integration with all imaginable energy,
courage and diligence, or shall we prefer to, let us say, take care
only about ourselves?''
</P>
<P>
   His own answer is perfectly clear.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If he has any regrets about his tenure so far, Havel said, it
was to remain above party politics for too long. ``My greatest
mistake I would like to articulate after my term is over,'' he
said. ``But unconsciously and unintentionally, I helped revive the
bad tradition of partisanship,'' he said, by not intervening early
on in party political life. ``I let political life run its own
course. I think I shouldn't have done that. I should have been more
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Havel means that he should have used his unparalleled power and
authority 10 years ago to shape post-Communist politics more
actively and break old patterns of party authority and cronyism,
Pehe and others said. Unlike Poland and Hungary, where reform
thrived inside the Communist Party and undermined Moscow's control,
Czechoslovakia in 1989 had a repressive, nearly Stalinist state
imposed after the Soviets invaded in 1968 to quell a reformist
government.
</P>
<P>
   Havel now feels that more could have been done to punish the
guilty on legal grounds rather than simply barring thousands of
people from jobs with the government on the basis of unchecked
secret police files. And friends say Havel feels he also could have
done more to prevent the breakup of Czechoslovakia, which split on
Jan. 1, 1993, into the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
   Havel also regrets, Pehe said, supporting Klaus and allowing him
to gain such prominence in politics. Klaus, as prime minister,
presided over a privatization program of state industries and
enterprises that is now considered to have been badly tainted by
cronyism and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Urbanek said: ``Of course there are days Havel is really fed up
with the job _ for example because of the political makeup of the
Parliament. He's admitted that he made mistakes in the early '90s
by choosing, supporting and recommending certain people for the
Parliament and the government. Later it showed that those people
were not the right ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Klaus and now Prime Minister Milos Zeman, Western
diplomats say, Prague has done too little to restructure its
economy, reform its judicial and legal system, crack down on
corruption, build respect for the rule of law, protect outside
investors and pressure politicians to act in the democratic spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of personalized politics,'' Pehe said. ``People
don't yet understand that democracy is more than just democratic
institutions, but the democratic spirit of compromise, discussion
and tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Havel has regularly mentioned, in his speeches, the need for a
better moral underpinning to Czech society and the importance of
the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   While Havel's moral stances have burnished his reputation in the
West, his scolding has not always been popular at home.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. ambassador here, John Shattuck, praised Havel for his
``intense engagement as a political leader,'' especially lately.
``He has been willing to use his political capital to sometimes
make unpopular decisions and interventions in Czech politics,''
Shattuck said.

 PRAGUE, Czech Republic: Shattuck said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Havel long had approval ratings of more than 80 percent,
they fell to 46 percent last spring, when he threatened a lawsuit
against a writer who accused the president's new wife of having an
affair and talked of resigning. His approval rating hovers now at
about 52 percent, according to the Institute for Research of Public
Opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the death from cancer of his first wife, Olga _ to
whom, from his prison cell, Havel wrote the moving and influential
``Letters to Olga'' _ shook him badly, friends say. Less than a
year later, in January 1997, he married Dagmar Veskrnova, now 46,
an actress known by her nickname, Dasa (pronounced Dasha). While
some envied him her beauty, others considered her beneath the role
of presidential wife. The tabloids and Web sites had a field day.
</P>
<P>
   Urbanek said: ``His second wedding marked the change. That's
when his popularity began to decline. Olga was very popular, and
the same cannot be said about his second wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Discussion of these issues seems to have calmed. In late
September, however, in another indication that his halo is gone,
Havel was roundly criticized here for agreeing to drive a new model
car from the Skoda factory, which is 70 percent owned by Volkswagen
and 30 percent by the state, and then driving it about 100 miles an
hour, far above the posted speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   Jana Reichlova, a student of 20, says she still honors Havel.
``But he shouldn't have run for the presidency at the last
election'' in January 1998, she said. ``I think he has withdrawn
himself and become estranged from the people. His decision to marry
Dasa was unfortunate, especially so soon after his first wife
died.''
</P>
<P>
   Jiri Reinisch, 50, a mechanic, was especially bitter. ``I think
Havel should have left at the height of his career,'' he said. ``He
really doesn't have much to say anymore. And he didn't punish those
who should have been punished, the Communist cadres. I believed
Havel would bring democracy and justice, but he really disappointed
me. All the Communists who stole were allowed to keep their wealth,
and today they are captains of industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Reinisch, a short, sandy-haired man, summarized the Havel
plight: ``He gave people hope but did not fulfill it, and he's not
as good as the foreigners think he is. But we don't have anyone to
replace him _ that's the problem. Nobody here has his reputation
abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Havel himself still maintains a healthy dose of self-contempt,
Pehe said. ``On the one hand, he really is a symbol of this
transition to democracy, but in many important ways this experiment
here has gone wrong, and despite his speeches and warnings, he's
associated with what has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Half of Czechs now, Pehe said, ``see Havel as a symbol of the
political establishment, of what's happening here that they don't
like, of the first 10 years with all its success and failures.''
</P>
<P>
   Havel is resigned to his fate _ and proud of his choices. ``I
didn't become a president thanks to some latent lifelong desire for
the presidency,'' he said in the interview. ``I took it as a
service for my country. And after 10 years I can say one thing: The
service is much harder than I expected when I accepted it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question whether I regret it is like asking me whether I
regret that I was born. It's simply a part of my life; I take it as
a fact.''
</P>
<P>
   While he writes all his own speeches and insists that ``I fully
use my creativity in my current job,'' the country's best
playwright continues to plot. ``That does not mean I sometimes
don't step back and look at things from a distance and store this
experience in my head for later use,'' he said.

TURNING 75, EMBATTLED CHIAPAS BISHOP RELUCTANTLY OFFERS
RESIGNATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JULIA PRESTON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia, the embattled Roman
Catholic prelate who championed the cause of the Indians in Chiapas
state and tried to make peace between the government and the
Zapatista rebels, turned 75 Wednesday and offered his resignation,
obediently but reluctantly, to Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   Because Ruiz has often clashed with the Vatican, the pope is
generally expected to accept the resignation promptly. The bishop
made it clear that he considered his term to be effectively over.
But in a sign of his distress, he said he would wait until the last
minute, just before midnight, to sign and send his letter to Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz and thousands of followers joined in a daylong birthday
party that packed the cathedral and streets of San Cristobal de las
Casas, the seat of his Chiapas diocese, in a celebration that was
muted by more than a touch of mourning.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz is one of the few advocates of the school of Catholic
thought known as Liberation Theology who still holds a position of
influence in the Latin American church. Pope John Paul has opposed
that theology, saying it led Catholics to take up radical leftist
politics, and he systematically sidelined its proponents.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruiz, who is in his 40th year as diocesan leader, developed
a fervent following among his Indian parishioners, who called him
``Tatic,'' which means father in one Indian language. Also, for
four years after the Zapatistas' brief armed uprising in January
1994, he was a pivotal mediator in talks to end the rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the Vatican, through its papal nuncio in Mexico,
publicly invited Ruiz to step down. But many Mexican bishops
rallied behind him. So the Vatican allowed him to continue until he
reached the mandatory retirement age of 75.
</P>
<P>
   He was a doctrinal conservative when he was anointed bishop at
the age of 35. But his thinking changed on donkey-back journeys to
mountainside villages where he saw the misery in which the Indians
lived.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Ruiz mobilized a network of more than 2,000 Indian
Bible teachers in remote areas of Chiapas, the first Indian
organization to be so extensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``His contribution more than anything else was to get those
people started on the course of organizing themselves,'' said John
Womack, a historian from Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, some of Ruiz's acolytes grew frustrated with the
authorities' hostile responses to their demands for better
treatment, and secretly joined the Zapatista guerrillas. After the
rebels' attacks on several Chiapas towns in 1994, government
officials and local landowners faulted Ruiz for instigating the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz actively supported the Zapatistas' calls for greater Indian
rights, but he never endorsed the rebels' use of guns. Government
and military officials tried time and again to discredit Ruiz by
showing that he had helped to arm the guerrillas, but they failed.
</P>
<P>
   His teachings polarized some Indian communities, and
pro-government Indian leaders grew to despise him. In recent years,
he had to wear a bulletproof helmet when he traveled in rural
areas. In 1997, gunmen ambushed the bishop's vehicle. He escaped
unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo had accused
him of preaching a ``theology of violence,'' Ruiz resigned as
mediator in the peace talks. Now Zedillo has no intermediary
trusted by the rebels, and the negotiations are virtually dead.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz will continue to preside in the diocese until the pope
formally instructs him to step down. Adjunct Bishop Raul Vera
Lopez, 53, who was appointed Ruiz's deputy in 1995, is in line to
take over.

 &HT;    Georgia schools employ nearly 3,000 with criminal records
 &HT;    By Doug Cumming
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Parents who assume all teachers, school bus drivers
and other school employees have been checked for a criminal past
are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a 1994 state law requiring fingerprinting and criminal
background checks, nearly 3,000 school employees in Georgia have
criminal records. That's about 1.5 percent of public school
employees.
</P>
<P>
   That number includes a teacher who pleaded guilty to aggravated
assault and one who is a habitual DUI offender, according to a
joint analysis of computerized state records by The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution and WSB-TV.
</P>
<P>
   How could these people still be working in Georgia's schools?
State and local officials, confronted with the numbers, offer
several possible explanations:
</P>
<P>
   _ While fingerprinting and background checks have been required
since July 1994, they apply only to teachers and other certified
educators hired since then. Teachers who began working for a school
system before then are not checked, even when they come up for
five-year recertification.
</P>
<P>
   _ The state relies on applicants for certification or
recertification to disclose whether they have been convicted of a
crime, or whether their teaching license was denied or revoked in
any state. No one verifies their answers.
</P>
<P>
   _ The 1994 law doesn't require background checks for
noncertified workers, such as custodians, secretaries, bus drivers
and food workers. Many school systems run checks anyway before
hiring these workers, but some are deterred by the $25 per
applicant cost and the processing time, which can take up to 200
days.
</P>
<P>
   _ Local school districts that discover a criminal record on a
new or existing employee do not always take action, nor do they
always report it to the state teacher-licensing agency, the
Professional Standards Commission, although they are required to do
so by state law.
</P>
<P>
   A criminal record does not necessarily keep a teacher out of the
classroom, even when acknowledged or discovered. Each case is
considered individually, said Peggy Torrey, head of the
Professional Standards Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Convictions for sex offenses, felony drug offenses and most
other felonies, when reported, generally result in loss of
certification, Torrey said. ``But there are always extenuating
circumstances,'' such as the number of years of good behavior since
the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The only type of criminal conviction not subject to Professional
Standards Commission discretion is a DUI conviction less than 12
months old. In such cases, state law automatically requires
quarterly monitoring for any infraction, Torrey said.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal-Constitution acquired databases from the Department
of Corrections listing all convictions on record at least since the
late 1970s, from the Department of Education listing all 187,000
public school employees as of May, and from the Professional
Standards Commission listing all licensed educators. An analysis
matching names and dates of births, and Social security numbers
where available, and discarding matches with slight
inconsistencies, revealed 2,931 school employees with criminal
records. Of those, 168 have spent time in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Two teachers, after being confronted by a WSB-TV reporter about
criminal convictions on their records, have resigned:
</P>
<P>
   Gary Lewis Floyd, who was a physical education teacher at
Chesnut Elementary in the Dunwoody area of DeKalb County, had a
misdemeanor conviction for cocaine possession from South Carolina
that he did not disclose when he was hired. Patricia Kennedy, a
teacher's aide at Osborne High School in Cobb County, was convicted
of multiple charges of check, food stamp and credit card fraud from
1978, '79, '86 and '92.
</P>
<P>
   The form most teachers have signed since 1991 for
recertification requires they say whether they have been convicted
of a misdemeanor or a felony. But no one routinely verifies the
responses.
</P>
<P>
   One current Rockdale middle school teacher was jailed for a
conviction of voluntary manslaughter in 1969, according to
corrections records. Torrey, asked to check state certification
records on the teacher, said the teacher denied any felony
convictions when first certified in 1978 and in the latest
recertification.
</P>
<P>
   Torrey said she and her staff generally rely on a complaint from
a citizen to begin an investigation, but could begin one based on
such a newspaper or TV investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal-Constitution provided the Professional Standards
Commission a copy of the nearly 2,000 records that matched in its
teacher certification records and the state Department of
Corrections inmate and parole databases.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, 298 subjects spent time in the Georgia prison system.
</P>
<P>
   The Professional Standards Commission records are of valid
teaching certificates but do not reflect whether the people holding
them are employed by schools or even alive. Tom Hall of the
Professional Standards Commission said the information would ``be
helpful in our research.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all teachers with criminal records lie on the form. A school
social worker for Fulton County who served time for four counts of
theft by taking in the 1970s checked ``yes'' to felony conviction
on his initial certification form of October 1998. Torrey said the
answer triggered a hearing by the Professional Standards
Commission, which cleared the employee to keep his job.
</P>
<P>
   Local school officials complain the 1994 law is flawed, putting
too much of the responsibility at the local level. ``The state law
put a real big burden on us when they failed to set a standard for
divining who gets fired and who doesn't get fired,'' said Dean
Grant, head of staff relations for DeKalb County schools.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gray, head of human resources for Fulton County schools,
said the required fingerprint checks are good for the credibility
of the system, but ought to be done for all employees and ought to
be funded by the state, if it's important enough to mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Torrey has other concerns about the current system. Since the
background check conducted by an individual district is required
only for hiring purposes, not for certification, the state relies
on local systems to report criminal records or misconduct to the
licensing agency.
</P>
<P>
   She suspects local school systems are not doing so enough, since
only 50 districts out of 180 made any such reports last year,
accounting for fewer than 18 percent of the 1,400 complaints
received.
</P>
<P>
   Torrey said she is submitting proposed legislation to close a
loophole that currently gives teachers some protection from state
discipline when they plead guilty to a first offense, instead of
going to trial. Other professions licensed by the state do not
grant such protection for first-offender status, she said.

MAN IS CONVICTED IN KILLING OF GAY STUDENT; JURY TO CONSIDER DEATH
PENALTY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (rk) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A jury in Laramie, Wyo., Wednesday found Aaron McKinney guilty
of second-degree murder in the killing of a gay University of
Wyoming student last year. By also finding him guilty of robbery
and kidnapping, the jury enabled prosecutors to seek a death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The same jury of seven men and five women will determine the
punishment in the second phase of the trial in Wyoming District
Court, starting on Thursday when lawyers will begin presenting
evidence to argue for and against execution.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict, which came after 10 hours of deliberations over two
days, brought a swift end to a case that has been watched closely
because of the brutality of the crime and the sexual orientation of
the victim, Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old political science
student. He was found on Oct. 7, 1998, unconscious and tied to a
fence on the prairie outside Laramie. He was taken to a hospital
with severe head wounds, and died five days later.
</P>
<P>
   A second defendant, Russell Henderson, 22, pleaded guilty last
spring and is serving a life sentence in prison without possibility
of parole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the first murder of its kind that really struck
people on a national level, touching people well beyond the gay
community,'' said Cathy Renna, a spokeswoman for the Gay and
Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, one of several gay groups that
expressed satisfaction with the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Montgomery, director of another gay group, the
Michigan-based Triangle Foundation, said the verdict indicates that
``there is really no excuse for this kind of barbarism.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinney, 22, who confessed to beating Shepard after he and
Henderson lured him out of a Laramie bar, was not offered a deal by
prosecutors. In a trial that lasted only seven days, they tried to
convince jurors that McKinney intended to kill Shepard after he and
his accomplice robbed him of $20.
</P>
<P>
   The jury rejected the element of intent, which is necessary for
a first-degree conviction and automatic consideration for
execution. But finding McKinney guilty on two other felony charges
in Wyoming established aggravating factors that elevate the options
of punishment to include death by lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   A Wyoming prosecutor not involved in the case, Mark Voss, said
that if McKinney had been found not guilty on the other two
charges, he would have faced only a prison term of 20 years to
life.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor said that by rejecting first-degree murder, it
was unlikely that the jurors would favor the death penalty for
McKinney. ``Whatever happens, they have said he did not intend, at
least initially, to kill Shepard,'' Voss said. ``Plus, he's very
young, is slightly built, has no significant violent past. He's not
your serious three-time loser serious felon, and that's a big
assist.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinney's lawyers were denied the option of presenting a ``gay
panic'' defense, a strategy intended to gain sympathy from the jury
by offering evidence that the defendant was so repulsed by a
homosexual advance that he automatically resorted to violence.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening arguments, one of McKinney's lawyers, Jason
Tangeman, told the jury that his client was sexually abused as a
child and that after Shepard made sexual advances toward him,
McKinney erupted with ``emotional rage.''
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Barton Voigt ruled that any sexual abuse that McKinney
suffered as a child that might have led him to react violently to
Shepard would not be admissible during the trial. Voigt said that
defense amounted to pleading temporary insanity or diminished
capacity, neither of which is a basis for defense under Wyoming
law.
</P>
<P>
   That left McKinney's lawyers the narrower grounds to argue that
the beating was spurred by drug addiction and alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Dion Custis, a lawyer for McKinney who concluded the defense
case before the jury, said in closing arguments on Tuesday: ``What
happened here was beyond comprehension. It's disgusting. It's
tragic. But it's not premeditated murder.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If McKinney were to be sentenced to death, he would join two
other Wyoming prisoners on death row. Since capital punishment was
declared constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1976, Wyoming
has executed only one criminal, in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   William K. Dobbs, a lawyer and a leader of a gay rights group
called Queerwatch, said putting McKinney to death would do gay men
and lesbians a disservice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The death penalty is wrong in all cases,'' Dobbs said,
reflecting a split among gay men and lesbians on capital
punishment. ``It will not bring back Matthew Shepard. The
eye-for-an-eye mentality is going to leave this country blind.''

`HEDWIG' MUSICAL A CULT HIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(For use Friday, Nov. 5 or thereafter)  
Our rating:  2.5 stars  
By REED JOHNSON 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ What's a nice ``girly-boy'' like Hedwig Schmidt
doing at the Henry Fonda Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard? Why, where
else but on the street of broken dreams would you expect to find a
hard-luck East German transsexual rock singer, desperately seeking
adoring fans, a punk backbeat and his/her Platonic alter ego?
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, Hedwig isn't the type to cry over spilled Coors. Oh,
at first glance, she looks fetching, even vulnerable, in those
Farrah Fawcett tresses, cowgirl boots and pink tassled outfit that
she wears in her angst-ridden rock 'n' roll confessional, ``Hedwig
and the Angry Inch.''
</P>
<P>
   But beneath Hedwig's campy, cross-dressing exterior lies the
soul of a true rock 'n' roll survivor. This, after all, is a guy
(gal?) who overcame a bungled sex-change operation that left her
(him?) with the unfortunate appendage that gives the show, and
Hedwig's rip-roaring backup band, its name.
</P>
<P>
   Even David Bowie, king of pop chameleons, couldn't match the
!ital!ch-ch-ch-ch-changes!off! that Hedwig has gone through en
route to self-realization, as she tells us in teary but resilient
German-inflected English.
</P>
<P>
   If you're wondering why you've never heard of this Teutonic
trouper, don't worry. Her impeccable rock pedigree aside, Hedwig
(nee Hansel) is really the artful confabulation of composer Stephen
Trask and actor-writer John Cameron Mitchell, who won multiple
awards for originating the title role in ``Hedwig and the Angry
Inch's'' New York debut.
</P>
<P>
   Since opening last winter, the pun-happy show has become a
boundary-blurring cult hit, attracting everyone from downtown
hipsters to middle-age Jersey suburbanites and celebrities such as
the aforementioned Mr. Bowie, one of its producers. Fittingly,
given its fixation on true and assumed identities, ``Hedwig''
arrived in L.A. on Halloween, attended by a dressed-to-kill
opening-night crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Does the show live up to its buzz? Not quite. Despite its
cunningly executed two-part harmony of parody and pathos, and an
expert, often painfully funny lead performance by Michael Cerveris,
``Hedwig'' is a modest concept pumped up by big expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Even with some ingenious nips and tucks, much of ``Hedwig's''
material bears a too-strong family resemblance to ``This Is Spinal
Tap,'' ``The Rocky Horror Picture Show'' and the pop-culture
spoof/homages of female impersonators such as Charles Busch and the
late Charles Ludlam.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, its glam heroine seems less an exciting new addition
to musical theater than a clever fusion of exotic predecessors,
real and invented _ from Marlene Dietrich and Adam Ant to ``Rocky
Horror's'' Dr. Frank-N-Furter and Belle Poitrine of Patrick Dennis'
``Little Me.''
</P>
<P>
   While Trask's score contains at least a pair of haunting tunes
and rocks a lot harder than ``Rent,'' it's too lyrically brittle to
make you want to fling yourself into the nearest mosh pit.
Mitchell's script also tends to belabor its points as the night
goes on.
</P>
<P>
   None of that, however, detracts from Cerveris, who first caught
Broadway's attention three years ago as the star of ``The Who's
Tommy.'' Here, he adroitly reinvents himself before our eyes while
relating the story of Hedwig's progression from East German
sex-abuse victim to reluctant Cold War ``bride'' to Kansas trailer
trash and rejected star-maker/lover of a selfish pop glamour boy
named Tommy Gnosis.
</P>
<P>
   Perfectly cast, Cerveris grasps at a gut level the
messianic/self-immolating gestalt of rock 'n' roll, its abiding _
though now almost quaint _ belief that an electric guitar can be a
force for personal and political transformation. In Hedwig's final
incarnation, as a kind of luminous, hairless Caliban, Cerveris
finds a harrowingly beautiful inner voice, and makes this wayward
show his own.

CLINTON VETO JUMP-STARTS TALKS WITH GOP ON SPENDING 
</HEADLINE>
  (With BUDGET-CAPS) 
(nk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Wednesday vetoed another of
the spending bills passed by Congress, but after speaking with the
two top Republican leaders he said he was ready to work around the
clock to settle the standoff over the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   There was little progress during the day as the two sides
wrangled over a variety of issues having less to do with how much
money the government will spend than with how it should be spent.
</P>
<P>
   Senior members of the House and Senate met Wednesday evening
with the White House budget director, Jack Lew, to try to reach an
agreement on the spending bill for foreign aid, which has none of
the money the president had demanded to further the peace process
in the Mideast. Several members said they would not leave the
meeting until an agreement was reached.
</P>
<P>
   White House negotiators said earlier Wednesday that they were
encouraged that House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois and Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi had called Clinton on
Wednesday afternoon in an effort to give the talks a push.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not given up, and neither have they,'' Clinton told
reporters during an appearance in the White House Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Republican aides said the two sides were particularly hopeful of
resolving their differences over funding for many foreign programs,
including money for implementing the latest Middle East peace
accord and paying the United States' past U.N. dues.
</P>
<P>
   In public, though, the two sides continued to assail each other.
</P>
<P>
   The bill vetoed by Clinton would fund labor, health and
education programs, and would cut spending for most federal
agencies by nearly 1 percent from the levels contained in this
year's appropriations bills. In explaining his veto, Clinton called
the bill ``a catalog of missed opportunities, misguided priorities
and mindless cuts in everything from education to national defense
to the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton suggested that Republicans in Congress were eager to
adjourn for the year and go home, but said he would insist that
they ``do their work first.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans repeated their argument that Clinton and Democrats
in Congress want to spend so much money on foreign aid that they
are endangering the financial stability of the Social Security
system.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ernest Istook, R-Okla., said that Clinton had spent 180
days during his presidency ``on foreign soil,'' and that during
those trips, to 104 countries, the president had proposed a total
of $22 billion in foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course there's no way to give that much money away unless
you did go into the Social Security surplus, which we're not about
to do,'' Istook said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas, said that Clinton ``ought to stick
his passport in the drawer for a while, and certainly remove that
credit card from his pocket when he goes to travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our seniors in this country are tired of paying the bill,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials and Democrats in Congress defended foreign
aid as a good investment in the security of the United States, and
said calls for further cuts were shortsighted. They said that
Republicans were the ones who passed spending bills that by the
accounting of the Congressional Budget Office will use $17 billion
of Social Security's money this year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has vetoed five of the 13 spending bills that finance
the government's operations. He is insisting that Republicans
rescind their plan for across the board cuts, and that they provide
the full financing for a number of his high-priority programs,
including a plan to hire 100,000 new teachers.

IRAN'S TOP LEADER ASSAILS COUNTRYMEN WHO FAVOR BETTER TIES WITH
U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)

<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Iran's supreme religious leader Wednesday marked
the 20th anniversary of the seizure of the U.S. Embassy here with a
fiery speech denouncing Iranian reformers who have called for
reconciliation with the United States as ``either simpletons or
traitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the conservative Muslim cleric who
wields paramount religious and political power in Iran, appeared to
slam the door on any easing of tensions between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he appeared to open a potentially explosive
chapter in a bitter power struggle between conservatives and
reformers within the ruling clergy, one in which conflicting
attitudes toward the United States will be as much a battlefield as
demands for more democracy and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly an hour, Khamenei _ before a student audience that
interrupted with cries of ``Death to America!'' and ``Death to
Israel!'' _ kept up a anti-American diatribe that was stunning in
its virulence. As though the Islamic Revolution of 1979 had
occurred only yesterday, he depicted the United States as a country
dedicated to subordinating and exploiting Iran and suppressing the
Islamic beliefs of its people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very clear today that America has no other fate in mind
for us today than before the revolution, that of submission, and
obviously we will fight that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even worse, he said, summoning up the specter of a
treacherous fifth column within Iran, was that ``a small but active
minority'' of clergy, secular politicians and journalists, people
for whom ``the dictates of Islam are not important,'' was working
for the United States against Iran's interests.
</P>
<P>
   Those people, said Khamenei, even suggested that the 20th
anniversary of the embassy takeover, to be marked Thursday with an
officially organized demonstration in front of the former embassy
compound in central Tehran, be changed from its traditional format
of banner-waving, slogan-shouting hostility to something less
confrontational. That appeared to be a reference, in part, to the
main student group at the University of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are even trying to convert `The Day of Confronting
Global Arrogance''' _ the celebration's formal title _ ``into a day
of softness toward America,'' Khamenei said. ``I can only say they
are either simpletons or traitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Since a presidential election 30 months ago that was won by
Mohammad Khatami, a high-ranking, reform-minded cleric who reached
out to the United States with a call for ``a dialogue of
civilizations,'' Tehran and Washington have maintained a frequent
exchange of public messages, each speaking of its interest in
opening contacts while setting conditions the other side has
rejected. Meanwhile, both governments have encouraged a resumption
of unofficial contacts.
</P>
<P>
   But Khamenei's speech gave an ominous twist to the internal
debate in Iran. Without mentioning Khatami, whose powers are mostly
subordinate to his own, Khamenei appeared to invite a showdown, one
that many Iranians fear could stretch tensions to the breaking
point.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, conservatives have appeared to be looking for
any opportunity to crack down on the reformers, in an attempt to
gain advantage ahead of key parliamentary elections in February in
which the reformers are widely expected to win a majority.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the worst, reformers worry that popular frustrations on a
wide range of issues _ mainly those dealing with political
repression and the battered state of Iran's economy _ could touch
off fresh outbreaks of violence, of the kind that erupted when
police and armed Islamic vigilantes cracked down on pro-reform
students in July.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the reformers fear, conservatives could use public
disorder as an excuse to cancel the elections, or to disqualify
large numbers of reform candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks Wednesday, Khamenei adopted what amounted to a
time-tested revolutionary tactic, of setting a litmus test that
could be used to identity and eliminate opponents. In effect, he
put reformers on notice that further advocacy of improved ties with
Washington would be regarded as un-Islamic and treasonable, terms
that have been used since the revolution to justify severe
punishments.
</P>
<P>
   While many Iranians seem exhausted with the drumbeat of
anti-American polemics, Khamenei insisted that hostility toward the
United States should be unremitting.
</P>
<P>
   For ``three or four years,'' he said, senior U.S. officials had
been saying they wanted a new relationship with Iran. But he said
U.S. intentions had been become clear recently when a ``woman
official'' in Washington _ meaning Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright _ had said Iran would have to abandon its hostility toward
the Middle East peace effort as a condition of the United States
dropping economic sanctions and other aspects of its
``containment'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zionists are the main policy-makers of America,'' Khamenei
said, ``and the problem is that Iran is the biggest and most
important center of confrontation with Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Among reformers, the stridency of ayatollah's remarks were a
shock. Although courts that are under the religious leader's
control have stepped up prosecutions of reformers in recent months,
Khamenei appeared to hold out an olive branch to Khatami as
recently as a month ago. But subsequent actions have persuaded many
Iranians that the religious leader may have only been seeking to
put the reformers off guard.

   WASHINGTON _ As Congress and the Clinton administration head
into the final stages of their negotiations over the federal
budget, both sides say they are determined to avoid spending any
portion of the money that flows to the government through the
Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side, however, is saying much about another benchmark
for fiscal restraint, the spending limits that became law as part
of the 1997 bipartisan budget deal.
</P>
<P>
   Without any announcement, or a specific vote to do so, the
Republican-controlled Congress has shattered those caps this year
in all but the most technical sense, voting to spend at least $23
billion more than the $580 billion limit for the fiscal year that
started Oct. 1. It is the second year in a row that Congress has
exceeded the limits, and like last year, the White House has gone
along. For all practical purposes, the caps are dead.
</P>
<P>
   In shunting the caps aside, the two parties are to some extent
confirming what some budget analysts contended all along: that the
caps as set in 1997 were a sham from the start. Under that view,
the limits were too low to be sustained and were nothing more than
an effort to put off dealing with the political pain that both
sides assumed would be necessary to bring the budget into balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The caps set in 1997 for '99 and later years were unrealistic
at the time they were set and certainly have become unrealistic
since then,'' said James Horney, a senior fellow at the Center on
Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research
organization. ``They probably became less realistic both because
with surpluses it's harder for people to talk about cutting
spending and because there was a bipartisan consensus this year to
keep defense spending at the same level or increase it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the caps are the product of a time when no one expected
the nation's fiscal health to improve as rapidly as it has. There
is clearly a case to be made that there is more room for spending
now than anyone anticipated in 1997, when no one in either party
could foresee that the budget deficit would be wiped out so quickly
and that Washington would be consumed by a debate over what to do
with huge and growing surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Washington, caps have been hard to meet,'' said Sen. Trent
Lott of Mississippi, the Republican majority leader, ``and while
they haven't been met, to be perfectly candid, they have provided
some pressure and some resistance to out-of-control spending. I
think they served a positive purpose, but like any law, any budget
agreement, two, three years down the road, circumstances change.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Washington has now substituted a new standard of
fiscal responsibility: the looser goal of not spending surplus
Social Security money. Only through budget gamesmanship can either
party claim to be meeting even that new standard this year, with
the Congressional Budget Office estimating that the spending bills
as passed by both chambers would dip into Social Security to the
tune of $17 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But neither party has been willing to acknowledge the obvious
and call for the caps to be increased or abolished before they
expire in 2002, fearing with some reason that the other side would
immediately lob charges of fiscal irresponsibility. And in hanging
on to the fiction that they are living within the caps by employing
all manner of legerdemain, they are arguably undermining the
credibility of the entire federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been death by gimmick to the budget caps,'' said Robert
L. Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a research
group that advocates fiscal restraint. ``Even those of us on the
fiscal conservative side think it would be better to adjust them to
more realistic levels than to have a dishonest budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Barring an increase in the spending limits or their repeal, the
problem will only get worse. The caps for the next two years are
even lower than for this year. They would fall to $575 billion next
year and $569 billion the following year.
</P>
<P>
   The limits apply to the one-third of the $1.8 trillion federal
budget known as discretionary spending, the part that has to be
appropriated annually and encompasses everything from the military
to Head Start. (The rest of the budget consists of mandatory
spending on longstanding commitments like Social Security plus
interest payments on the debt.)
</P>
<P>
   The limits were applied starting in 1990, when Congress and the
Bush administration agreed on the first major effort to reduce the
deficit. For most of the time since then, they functioned just as
they were intended to. The question before Congress each year was
not how much it should spend, but how it should divide up a defined
pot of money.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1991 and 1998, according to the Concord Coalition,
discretionary outlays increased only about 4 percent, or $20
billion, to $555 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But last year a combination of factors led the two parties to
break their pattern of restraint.
</P>
<P>
   The deficit was erased, as long as Social Security money was
included in the government's revenues, and it became clear that the
budget could be balanced within a few years even without Social
Security money. Both parties displayed a pent-up demand for
spending, with aid to farmers, increased spending on education and
a renewed commitment to Pentagon programs heading the list.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, Congress and the administration must remain
within the caps or the White House must enact across-the-board cuts
to bring spending back into line _ a politically unappealing step.
So last year they exploited a loophole intended to deal with wars
or natural disasters: They designated $20 billion in outlays as
``emergency'' spending that is not technically subject to the
limits.
</P>
<P>
   They have employed the same technique this year. Although many
of the bills are likely to change somewhat as negotiations between
the Republican leadership and the White House continue, the
appropriations committees have almost arbitrarily placed $17.5
billion in discretionary spending _ including spare parts for the
Pentagon and financing for the 2000 census _ under the emergency
umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   They have also used a tactic that compares spending estimates
for particular programs from the Congressional Budget Office and
the White House's Office of Management and Budget, and then chooses
the lower of the two. Doing so has allowed Republicans to claim a
``savings'' of $16 billion on discretionary programs relative to
the official estimates from the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   Together the two techniques bring discretionary spending subject
to the caps down from about $603 billion to about $570 billion, $10
billion below the caps.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anyone in either party defends the gimmicks. They tend
instead to suggest that Washington has already succeeded in meeting
the spirit of the 1997 agreement if not its letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can hold them up as the ultimate tripwire, as the test of
whether Congress did or did not perform,'' said Sen. Larry E.
Craig, R-Idaho. ``Or you can say they were made obsolete by
Congress' performance and the economy's performance. The latter is
a much fairer analysis.''

 &HT;    HUD SEEKS CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION OF ATLANTA CONTRACTOR
 &HT;    EDS: Corrects title and company name in 2nd graf. Inserts a 4th
graf for clarity.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Housing and Urban Development official told a
congressional hearing Wednesday that his department was seeking a
criminal investigation of an Atlanta man and two partners for
possible fraud in a $367 million federal contract.
</P>
<P>
   Melton L. Harrell is chairman and chief executive officer of the
Atlanta-based InTown Management Group LLC, a real estate company
that filed for bankruptcy protection Sept. 22, the same day HUD
terminated the firm's contract to sell homes that came to the
government through foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Housing Commissioner William Apgar charged that InTown
had ``misrepresented to HUD the resources they would devote to this
contract.'' The agreement, signed in March, made the company the
overseer for almost 40 percent of the HUD-owned homes nationwide.
By the time HUD cancelled the contract, InTown had sold fewer than
2,300 of 25,000 U.S.-owned properties.
</P>
<P>
   Apgar called for the housing agency's inspector general to
investigate and wants HUD to refer the matter to the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses told the hearing about unpaid maintenance bills,
damage to neighborhoods and local real estate markets, and of home
buyers who found the properties suddenly slapped with liens.
</P>
<P>
   Members of a House Government Reform subcommittee expressed
surprise that federal officials had signed a contract that covered
more than 20 states without checking Harrell's full background.
Harrell had spent three years in jail and a halfway house for
forgery, and at least a dozen of his companies have filed for
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something wrong in the procedure when (the government)
awards $367 million contract to a guy with a conviction on
felonies,'' Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., chairman of House Government
Reform's criminal justice subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mistake was in HUD awarding a contract to these fleecing
artists,'' Mica said of InTown.
</P>
<P>
   Apgar told the lawmaker that officials ``were not aware at the
time the contract was issued'' of Harrell's history. He said that
HUD's own files turned up no problems with Harrell's previous
contracts. He also said that the federal government has no
requirement for checking criminal records as far back as the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Mica chided the department, saying that Harrell's background was
uncovered after ``a pretty basic check that even the media did.''
(The existence of the convictions for forgery in the late 1970s and
of the bankruptcy records was first made public Wednesday by the
Atlanta Constitution.)
</P>
<P>
   Harrell's office said Wednesday that he would not be available
to comment on HUD's pursuit of a criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Another participant in the contract, Albert Gonzales of Gonzales
Consulting Services Inc., in Denver, said he had no immediate
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The third partner, Larry Latham, president of Larry Latham
Auctioneers, LTD, of Phoenix, did not respond to a request for a
response to the HUD allegations.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's congressional hearing, Chicago realtor Joyce A.
Gibson described the problems that befell many maintenance and
repair workers, who were unable to collect for their services after
InTown's filed for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many small businesses in Illinois and 20 other states
around this country, that day will live in infamy,'' Gibson told
the subcommittee. She said that she formed a group, Unity Coalition
for Accountability, from about 80 subcontractors who have lost a
total of $7.8 million as a result of InTown's collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Some 240 churches have joined the group, she said, after
discovering that the backlog of unsold, abandoned homes was
creating health and safety hazards in neighborhoods across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Apgar told the hearing that HUD would reimburse the
subcontractors, but he indicated the payments would be delayed
because of InTown's bankruptcy proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the company's records ``are in substantial
disarray.''
</P>
<P>
   Another witness, home buyer Cheryl Peterson of Boise, Idaho,
told how her family was almost left homeless when they were about
to purchase one of the InTown-managed houses. Just as they were
about to move into the home, she said, a title search turned up
liens by maintenance subcontractors InTown had failed to pay.her
for Peterson said she paid off the $1,400 in liens so she could
complete the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Apgar said that HUD would reimburse that payment.

 &HT;    A passion for pandas pays off, against the odds
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Not long ago, Zoo Atlanta languished as a third-rate,
probably inhumane facility. Now, its animals live better and its
programs have garnered respect, but it's still small and obscure
compared with many other American zoos.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Zoo Atlanta is one day away from a major zoo coup: receiving
panda cubs Yang-Yang and Lun-Lun from China. Only two other
American zoos, the much larger San Diego Zoo and the National Zoo
in Washington, have the rare bears on exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   To get the pandas, Zoo Atlanta not only had to persevere through
difficult negotiations with the Chinese _ dickering that involved a
former president of the United States and top Chinese leaders _ but
it also had to meet new U.S. regulations, something no other zoo
has been willing or able to do.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, several American zoos borrowed pandas from China
for short periods. The loans boosted attendance but did little for
the endangered pandas, so the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service began
banning imports except those that would help the animals multiply.
</P>
<P>
   The agency approved Zoo Atlanta as the two cubs' new home
because of its $22 million plan to produce panda cubs and to find
out why giant pandas don't mate well in captivity. The zoo's
project will fund research both at the zoo here and in China. It
could make a major difference in the fight to keep the rare bears
from going the way of the dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scientific research at Zoo Atlanta is the key to their
survival,'' says Sydney Butler, head of the American Zoo and
Aquarium Association in Washington, which accredits zoos. ``Now,
for the first time, extensive collaborative research on pandas can
take place in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The driving force behind the project is Director Terry Maple,
the Billy Payne of Atlanta's pandas.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing pandas here has been his passion since 1984, when Zoo
Atlanta was still called Atlanta zoo _ and was a disgrace.
Conditions there were so bad that it had lost its AZA
accreditation. The city, which owned the hapless zoo, had turned it
over to the private sector to run, and a new board of directors had
quickly named Maple _ a wildlife psychologist already renowned for
animal research _ as its director.
</P>
<P>
   His immediate goal was to reshape the zoo into a model of
excellence. Butler and other zoologists say he's succeeded to a
remarkable degree. Zoo Atlanta is now known for its work in
naturalistic design, education and propagation of endangered
species.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mandate was to rebuild the zoo in a new image, and the new
image we developed was a scientific-educational institution of very
high quality,'' Maple says. ``We've done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Maple's dream began while he gawked at pandas at the 1984
Olympics in Los Angeles. ``It occurred to me this might be an
interesting project for Atlanta,'' he says. ``I thought down the
road, we might qualify.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a bold thing to even consider. When Maple began his long
panda odyessy, the odds of success were much longer than those of
Atlanta hosting the 1996 Summer Games. Through it all, Maple had to
clear more hurdles than ACOG chief Payne, with comparatively little
money, publicity or legal help. It took him five times longer than
Payne needed to get the Olympics for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Through friends at Georgia Tech, he began making contacts with
scientists in China, and soon formal, sporadic discussions began.
Former President Jimmy Carter agreed to broach the subject with
then Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who liked the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Maple met with Chinese diplomats in New York, then flew to China
on the first of many trips in 1987 to ink a deal for a panda loan.
Relations between Beijing and Washington grew icy, however, and by
the time they thawed, a moratorium on panda imports had been
imposed by the AZA.
</P>
<P>
   After that moratorium was lifted, San Diego obtained two pandas,
but bureaucratic difficulties in Beijing and Washington ruled out
any chance of importing any more pandas until 1998. Late that year,
Zoo Atlanta struck its deal by promising its scientific project.
</P>
<P>
   It was an expensive promise. Maple had to convince Atlanta's
biggest companies to lend their support. As he went hat-in-hand,
small successes led to big ones. He raised the money and built the
world's most expensive panda habitat, a $7 million facility.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he convinced the Fish and Wildlife Service
that the zoo's plan would help save the panda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zoo Atlanta had to really have a splendid and convincing
plan,'' Butler says. ``They did. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
is bound by law to make sure any importation of an endangered
species ultimately benefits the conservation of that species in the
wild. It's a position they take very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Molter of the San Diego Zoo also lauds the Atlanta Zoo's
project. He promises his own scientists will spend a lot of time
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to add to the store of knowledge to save the pandas,''
he says. ``The young animals at Zoo Atlanta will be more data
points for more research.''
</P>
<P>
   The giant panda's natural habitat in central China has been
shrinking for decades, as humans encroach. Only some 1,000 live in
the wild, and about 120 more live in captivity, most of them in
China.
</P>
<P>
   Because the bears are emotionally sensitive, they're not even
mating much in their shrunken natural habitat these days. Panda
females come into estrous only once a year, and they are solitary
creatures. So it's rare when males and females meet, and then they
need to perform a rough-and-tumble courtship, a precursor to
mating.
</P>
<P>
   One of Maple's goals is to find out if males and females, living
in close proximity, can become friendly enough so that they'll mate
when they grow out of adolescence at about age 5.
</P>
<P>
   The Zoo Atlanta habitat is designed to keep the pandas close at
all times, but it also allows the creatures to be alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, we must find answers,'' Maple says. ``We've got
to understand how pandas develop to adulthood. It's a new subject,
and the behavioral area is where we hope to make a contribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know almost nothing about the mental life of pandas, how
they solve problems, how they find food, how they find mates.
Nobody knows the rate they mate. So to save these animals, we
really need to leap our understanding. And that's what we intend to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Yang-Yang and Lun-Lun will be here for at least 10 years, and
the zoo expects that loan will be extended indefinitely. Any
offspring, however, will be Chinese. In three or four years, Maple
hopes send a baby panda back to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't afford to let a beautiful animal disappear,'' Maple
says. ``As human beings, we can't afford to let that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler says it was Maple's stamina, determination, dedication
and wit, along with bravado, that helped him land the pandas.
</P>
<P>
   A soft-spoken bear of a man, Maple shrugs off such accolades.
</P>
<P>
   ``My leadership, patience, flexibility, optimism, tenacity,
confidence, toughness, commitment and wisdom have all been tapped,
tested and stretched,'' Maple says. ``It has been a wild and wooly
ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he feel like a hero?
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel harried, not like a hero,'' he laughs. ``There's so
much to do. I haven't had time to feel happy or smug. I don't feel
special, I just feel blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Are the comparisons with Billy Payne on target?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, they were great odds. Billy Payne demonstrated just what
can happen in Atlanta if you have the will and vision. I think the
panda plan has been greatly enhanced by Atlanta's willingness to
chase dreams. And this is a dream I've chased, but I've had a hell
of a lot of help.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's he expect to do today and tonight, as the pandas'
journey nears?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be tossing and turning all night,'' he says. ``And my
staff and I will have a little Dom Perignon moment. We'll cry a
little, and share some champagne. It'll really be a thing to
celebrate.''

   The world is coming to an end and even Canadians are taking
action. But they remain resolutely Canadian to the final moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Night'' marks the directing debut of Don McKellar, an
actor (``eXistenZ,'' ``The Red Violin'') and writer (``Violin,''
``Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould'') who has become quite
a force in north-of-the-border cinema. His film follows a
half-dozen interconnected characters through Earth's final day, and
is admirable for its wit, intelligence and determination to stay
focused on an individual, human scale.
</P>
<P>
   There's no space mission to save the planet from whatever may be
threatening it; in fact, we're never really told what's wrong, just
that night stopped getting dark some time ago. Government has long
since ceased to matter, if not exist, but a radio station still
reliably counts down the top 500 songs of all time. Even more
reassuring, a conscientious gas company director, played by David
Cronenberg, calls customers to tell them that there will be no
interruption in service until, well, no one will care.
</P>
<P>
   McKellar plays the central character, Patrick, who is
inexplicably determined to spend the last hours alone. But his path
keeps crossing that of Sandra (Sandra Oh), a woman trying to get to
the other side of Toronto to go out (and we do mean go out) with
her husband. Her journey is repeatedly frustrated by the Ontario
equivalent of chaos _ basically, a giant, sloppy rave party
accompanied by small-scale vandalism and violence.
</P>
<P>
   While Patrick and Sandra's reluctant bonding is the film's
mainspring, its most amusing sideshow takes place in the apartment
of Patrick's chum Craig (Callum Keith Rennie of TV's ``Due
South''). For weeks, he's been busily living out every sexual
adventure a human being could imagine, and his parade of
fantasies-come-true includes his high school French teacher, played
by Genevieve Bujold.
</P>
<P>
   These and many more poignant and absurd scenarios are presented
in a low-key, humanistic manner. Final, personal revelations are
hesitant but heartfelt when they do come, and heroics don't go much
beyond trying to hotwire an abandoned car or performing a first
(and last) piano recital as best one can for a small but
incalculably benevolent audience.
</P>
<P>
   As you may have gathered, the whole thing is also a little dry
in the telling. But after the bombast of ``Armageddon'' and the
trite emotional melodrama of ``Deep Impact,'' ``Last Night's''
low-key behavioral honesty offers something like hope for the
future.

 &HT;    Bradley's health care plan back for a second opinion
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Having dismissed Kenneth Thorpe as a partisan
sympathizer to Vice President Al Gore, Bill Bradley now wants the
Emory University expert to redo an analysis of Bradley's ambitious
health care proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe's first appraisal of Bradley's plan to offer
near-universal health care coverage to uninsured Americans found
that it would cost twice what Bradley estimated and cover fewer
people.
</P>
<P>
   Gore seized on the findings during the candidates' first town
hall meeting last week and used them to argue that Bradley's plan
would deplete the Treasury and jeopardize Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates exchanged a flurry of charges and counter charges
in the following days.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Thorpe has spoken to all of Bradley's top health
care advisers to clarify some aspects of the plan, and he said they
have asked him to crunch the numbers again.
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe, who also evaluated Gore's more modest health care
proposal, said Wednesday that he didn't yet know if his new
analysis of Bradley's plan would be lower than the $1.2 trillion,
10-year estimate he rendered last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are things that could move it in both
directions,'' said Thorpe, Health Policy and Management chairman at
the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's ongoing interest in Thorpe reflects the key role that
Bradley's health care proposal is playing in his campaign. It is
the most far-reaching of any proposal put forward by the
presidential candidates, and Bradley is using it to show that he is
a candidate of big ideas.
</P>
<P>
   In the two days after the town hall meeting last week, Bradley
issuednews releases undermining Thorpe's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   On CBS's ``Face the Nation'' on Sunday, Bradley called Thorpe
``a former Clinton-Gore staffer who as late as October referred to
himself as a `health adviser' to Vice President Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's worth about as much as any other partisan shot,''
Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe, who left the Clinton administration in 1995, said he
isn't giving policy advice to Gore now. The characterization of him
as a ``health adviser'' to the vice president came from an Emory
news release that Thorpe said he never saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my fault,'' he said. ``I think what they were trying to
do was to give some flavor of the multiplicity of the people that I
had worked with in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe first undertook his analysis of Bradley's plan at the
request of The Washington Post in early October for a story on how
proposals from Gore and Bradley would affect the federal budget.
Thorpe's analysis has already clarified one important aspect of
Bradley's proposal, which would allow the uninsured to buy into the
private network of insurers that cover federal employees.
</P>
<P>
   When Bradley unveiled the proposal in Los Angeles on Sept. 28,
he didn't spell out that premium subsidies would be capped at
$1,200 for each child and $1,800 for adults. There would also be a
$5,000 family cap.
</P>
<P>
   The caps have big implications for the overall cost of the
program and the number of people reached. Thorpe found that the
$1,800 figure for adults was too low. Very few of the 400 plans
available to federal employees have premiums that low. The lowest
plan available in Atlanta, for example, is $2,081.
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe assumed that fully subsidized adult premiums would more
likely cost $2,400 a year.
</P>
<P>
   But capping the premiums at $1,800 will mean that those taking
the government subsidy will have to make up the difference out of
their own pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a challenge to provide as much as you can for as many
people as you can,'' said Margy Heldring, Bradley's health policy
adviser. ``Of course there is room for improvement, but this
provides something to people who don't have much access.'' Thorpe,
who received a master's degree in public policy from Duke
University, has weathered far more serious controversies.
</P>
<P>
   From 1993 to 1995, he was a deputy assistant secretary at the
Department of Health and Human Services, and he belonged to the
White House task force that attempted to marshal President
Clinton's plan for universal health care coverage through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which failed in the fall of 1994, was the subject of
blistering attacks on Capitol Hill and a nationwide advertising
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes with the territory,'' said Thorpe, 43, who moved to
Atlanta from New Orleans this summer. But he said he's anxious to
move beyond a debate of which plan _ Gore's or Bradley's _ costs
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, the next time I let this out, we can focus
attention on what the plans are,'' he said. ``I'd like to see them
both get out and debate their plans.''

REJECTED REFERENDUMS INCLUDE ANTIGROWTH MEASURE IN N. CALIF.
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Wash., Colo., Calif., Ore., Maine)   (nk) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In wide-ranging referendums around the United
States, voters on Tuesday rejected the strictest antigrowth
measures in the country, approved the nation's most sweeping
antitax proposals, prohibited banks from imposing surcharges on
automated teller machines, and rejected proposals to allow murder
convictions based on nonunanimous jury votes and to ban late-term
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in three Northern California cities rejected antigrowth
measures that supporters said were necessary to stop the rapid
spread of Silicon Valley development and that opponents warned
would lead to epic traffic jams and higher taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Washington state voters approved an initiative that all but
eliminates a motor-vehicle tax. The initiative also requires voter
approval of any increases in state or local taxes, any government
fee covering everything from the price of a school lunch to the
cost of a building permit, and any rate increase for a
government-run utility.
</P>
<P>
   Oregonians rejected a measure that would have allowed defendants
to be convicted of murder by a jury vote of 11-1, while a
contentious battle was settled in Maine, where voters, by 55
percent to 45 percent, refused, for the third time in recent years,
to outlaw the late-term procedure that opponents call partial-birth
abortion. (Maine voters also passed the first medical marijuana law
on the East Coast, the eighth in the country, deciding by 61
percent to 39 percent to allow doctor-prescribed marijuana for
seriously ill patients.) San Francisco voters overwhelmingly
approved a ban on fees banks levy on ATM users who are not bank
customers, though the referendum faces a certain court challenge by
the banking industry.
</P>
<P>
   The most closely watched referendums were in Northern California
along the East Bay, where initiatives in Livermore, San Ramon and
Pleasanton would have allowed voters to approve or reject any
mid-size to large developments. In Pleasanton and San Ramon, any
proposed development over 10 units would have required a public
vote; in Livermore, the number would have been 20 units.
</P>
<P>
   The initiatives unleashed a fury of opposition from urban
planners, developers and environmentalists _ the latter because
they were concerned that the initiatives would force development
into farm country and worsen sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in Livermore, a city best known for the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, rejected the measure by a wide
margin. The vote was closer in Pleasanton and still closer in San
Ramon. The three cities are part of what is called the Tri-Valley,
which is one of the fastest-growing parts of the San Francisco Bay
area. The Interstates there, 580 and 680, provide corridors from
Silicon Valley east to the affordable-housing communities of the
San Joaquin Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The initiatives were organized by the Citizens Alliance for
Public Planning, a group of local residents concerned about how
congested the area has become as Silicon Valley's economy has
boomed. The Association of Bay Area governments has estimated that
over the next 20 years, the Tri-Valley will add 90,000 jobs and
86,500 more residents, and that green space will be at a premium.
</P>
<P>
   Voters apparently heeded the measures' opponents, who warned
that the initiatives, if approved, would cut anticipated job
growth, raise the average housing cost by $12,000 and worsen
already nightmarish traffic on the Interstates as Silicon Valley
workers were forced to commute longer distances.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's antitax measure, watched closely by antitax groups
around the country, was developed by citizens after the state
amassed a billion-dollar surplus but lawmakers did nothing to
reduce one of the country's highest car-licensing fees _ 2.2
percent of the vehicle's value. The initiative replaces the car
tax, the state's fourth-largest tax source, with a flat $30 annual
fee, for a loss of revenue of about $750 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Democratic governor, Gary Locke, had opposed the
measure, known as Initiative 695, on the grounds that it would put
a huge hole in the state's transportation budget and stall major
road-improvement projects.
</P>
<P>
   Locke had vowed to overhaul the car tax if the initiative was
defeated. Instead, he and state lawmakers face the formidable task
of deciding how to make the government work and minimize what some
local governments say will be the devastating budget cuts that
await.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, two major transportation initiatives were easily
approved, providing hope that many of the state's congested
highways will clear over the next decade. One authorizes the state
to borrow $1.7 billion for 24 major road projects. The other, which
voters in Denver and five contiguous counties approved, allows the
state to borrow $457 million to expand Denver's modest light-rail
system.

 &HT;    Mississippi governor's race could go to House
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. _ For the first time in its history, the
Mississippi House of Representatives might choose the next
governor, because Tuesday's popular vote was too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Ronnie Musgrove, a Democrat, had 49.5 percent of the
votes as of late Wednesday. Former U.S. Rep. Mike Parker, a
Republican, had 48.6 percent. Two third-party candidates split the
remaining votes. No one got the 50 percent plus one vote needed to
win.
</P>
<P>
   Still being counted are absentee and ``affidavit votes,'' which
were cast by people who did not bring identification to the polls
and signed a written statement saying who they were. Their
identities must be verified, and the process could take several
days.
</P>
<P>
   If, after that, neither Parker nor Musgrove has won, the state
House will decide who wins by voice vote in January. After
Tuesday's election, the House will be made up of 86 Democrats, 33
Republicans and three independents, so Musgrove would have an
obvious advantage.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``House members are not bound to vote according to how
their local district voted,'' House spokesman Mac Gordon said. ``No
one is bound to vote for anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   If Parker has more electoral votes, which are based on state
House districts, there could be more of a fight, observers said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third time in state history that a statewide
election has ended with no candidate getting a majority, according
to the Secretary of State's Office. It happened in the 1991 race
for lieutenant governor, but the candidate with fewer votes
conceded before the House could convene. The only time the House
has determined an election was the 1903 race for state Supreme
Court clerk.
</P>
<P>
   Legislatures have decided who will be governor in a few rare
instances around the nation. In Georgia in 1966, neither Republican
candidate Howard ``Bo'' Callaway nor Democrat Lester Maddox won
more than half the vote. The election went to the
Democrat-controlled General Assembly, which chose Maddox.
</P>
<P>
   Although Parker has fewer votes than Musgrove, he said in a
statement that he would not concede. Musgrove was calling the House
vote a ``formality,'' and President Clinton called Musgrove on
Wednesday, presumably to congratulate him.
</P>
<P>
   Before now, the closest governor's race in Mississippi history
was when Kirk Fordice beat Ray Mabus in 1991 to become the state's
first Republican governor in 100 years. He won 50.8 percent of the
votes to 47.6 percent for Mabus. Fordice is barred by law from
running for a third term.
</P>
<P>
   Many recent races in Mississippi have been extremely close.
Marty Wiseman, director of the Stennis Institute of Government at
Mississippi State University, said it is because Democrats and
Republicans have reached parity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just very, very matched here,'' he said. ``Unlike in
other Southern states, it hasn't tipped to being solidly
Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   That's due in part to Mississippi's black population, he said.
Blacks make up about 40 percent of the state's population, and they
traditionally vote for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Musgrove, 43, began his campaign last spring with a large lead
in the polls, but Parker, 50, quickly gained on him, and the two
had been in a dead heat for weeks.

MAYORAL ELECTION RESULTS IN 3 MAJOR CITIES HOLD SOME SURPRISES 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This file consists of 3 separate articles, each with its own
dateline and signature byline) 
(bl) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ After a harrowing election night vigil in which
he finally beat back his opponent by a hairbreadth margin, John F.
Street wearily faced his city early Wednesday morning and claimed
the mayoral prize with a humble plea: ``Give us a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the historic upset he had barely avoided, Street, the
56-year-old former president of the City Council, paid tribute to
Sam Katz, the Republican challenger who almost won this
overwhelmingly Democratic city.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tested our capacity, our work ethic,'' said the exhausted
mayor-elect, who saw his sizable front-runner's lead dwindle
precipitously across months of hard competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have really earned this victory,'' Street said, surveying
the election margin of 50.2 percent for himself and 48.5 percent
for Katz _ a difference of fewer than 8,000 votes in about 425,000
cast.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was not settled until 1:30 Wednesday morning when
Katz, having watched Street's margin in the running tally shrink to
2 points from 15 in little more than an hour, finally ran out of
mathematical hope and conceded.
</P>
<P>
   The result spared the Democrats the embarrassment of seeing Katz
elected the first Republican mayor since 1947 in this city that is
4-to-1 Democratic by registration. But the narrow victory was
hardly perceived as a mandate for Street, an insular, old-style
precinct politician who must now succeed the ebullient, successful
Edward G. Rendell as mayor of the nation's fifth-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   Street, the second black mayor in the city's history, seemed
mindful that the tight result means he will have to work hard to
show he deserves the office. Much of the campaign was about school
and safety problems that, despite impressive downtown renewal, have
seen 150,000 middle- and working-class residents leave the city in
the last decade. Beyond that, municipal unions that suffered with
the city through fiscally thin years are preparing to bargain hard
with the new mayor for larger benefits now that this city of 1.4
million is considered on the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been in this business a long time,'' Street told
supporters. ``I have not been perfect. I'm just going to ask you to
give us a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz, a 49-year-old consultant on the public-private financing
of sports stadiums, said, ``My opponent learned a lot about himself
and this city.''
</P>
<P>
   A former Democrat with political ties to the black community,
Katz rarely mentioned that he was a Republican. He ran as a
supporter of coalition government, private school vouchers and
deeper cuts in the city's wage tax.
</P>
<P>
   Street ran on his record as the ally of Rendell in bringing the
city back from bankruptcy, and as a veteran of 19 years on the City
Council and a proven master of the city's Democratic machine.
</P>
<P>
   Vote analyses showed a solid turnout by blacks, who voted better
than 90 percent for Street. Katz drew strong crossover support from
liberal Democrats in the Chestnut Hill and Center City areas while
barely failing to get a large enough turnout in Northeast and South
Philadelphia to turn the tide.
</P>
<P>
   In this city whose population is 40 percent black, race was a
dynamic but not an issue in the struggle between Street and Katz,
who is white. Both men were widely congratulated for avoiding a
return to the polarizing politics of a generation ago in the era of
Mayor Frank Rizzo. Both candidates, in fact, promised a joint
appearance for civic unity eventually regardless of the election
result.
</P>
<P>
   Street, who first came to attention a generation ago as a young
firebrand agitator for neighborhood improvement, attributed his
victory to a combination of efforts, from union support to clergy's
blessings, from ward captains who got out the party vote to
President Clinton's personal endorsement at a rally here last
Friday. He made open appeals to party loyalty in falling short of
the broad-based support enjoyed by the city's first black mayor, W.
Wilson Goode, in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   As the Democrats celebrated their narrow escape, Rendell, not
one to be upstaged in any crowd, let it be known in interviews on
local television that ``there's a decent likelihood'' he will be
running in the next race for governor of Pennsylvania, after he
serves next year as the Democratic national chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``John is going to have to rebuild some coalitions,'' said
Rendell, who defended the mayor-elect as a gifted though ``shy''
politician and a canny behind-the-scenes worker even if critics had
rated him short on what Rendell called on ``my natural openness.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's two major newspapers had shocked the Street camp by
endorsing Katz, an affable campaigner who basically ran as a
businessman with a less plodding vision of the city than Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about experience,'' Street doggedly insisted in reaching
for the Rendell mantle as he won the Democratic primary and, in the
early morning, City Hall itself. ``I've made a difference in this
city.'' &QL;

   SAN FRANCISCO MAYOR IS FORCED INTO RUNOFF
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After a long, hard-fought campaign, Mayor Willie
Brown will have six more weeks to convince voters he should still
be mayor.
</P>
<P>
   After failing to win a majority of the vote, the mayor faces a
run-off election Dec. 14. The mystery yet to be determined
Wednesday was who would be on the ballot as his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The incumbent fared better in Tuesday's election than recent
polls suggested, pulling 48 percent of the vote with 90 percent of
precincts reporting. Recent polls showed the mayor capturing 35
percent of the vote over his three major challengers, with about 25
percent of the voters undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise of the election was the remarkable showing of Tom
Ammiano, the president of the Board of Supervisors, who entered the
race less than three weeks ago. As of 4:30 p.m. Wednesday, Ammiano
was in second place, ahead of Frank Jordan, the former police chief
and mayor who Brown beat in a run-off election four years ago, by
100 votes. Clint Reilly, Jordan's former campaign manager, who
spent $3.5 million of his own money on the race, was in fourth
place. Ten minor candidates polled about 8 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   If Ammiano, a gay former stand-up comedian and special education
teacher who had originally decided in August not to run for mayor
because, he said, he did not think he could raise the money to
launch a competitive campaign, does make the run-off, it would be
the first time in San Francisco, and perhaps anywhere, that a
write-in campaign led to a viable candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   With 10,000 to 20,000 ballots yet to be counted, the Board of
Elections estimated that the final vote would not be known until
Friday.

   LIBERAL DEMOCRAT WINS IN SALT LAKE CITY  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Within the vast bastion of Republican
conservatism around Utah, Ross Anderson on Tuesday struck a blow
for liberal Democrats, winning election easily to become the next
mayor of Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   A former lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union who had
never held public office, Anderson, 48, won the nonpartisan
campaign with 60 percent of the vote, defeating Stuart Reid, a
moderate Democrat serving as director of the city's economic
development agency under Mayor Deedee Corradini.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and Reid were the top finishers among 12 candidates in
a primary in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will do so much to change people's mind-sets about
so-called liberalism when people throughout the state see that I'm
a competent administrator who can bring people together and solve
the serious challenges that face us,'' Anderson said Wednesday in
an interview at his home. ``Somehow, they think we're all out there
just demonstrating, walking women to abortion clinics and
performing same-sex marriages.''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 30 years, Salt Lake City has remained an anomaly in
Utah politics, a place where most of the state's Democrats and
members of non-Mormon churches reside. They have steadily elected
Democrats as mayor since E.J. Garn in 1971. Beyond city limits,
virtually all meaningful elected posts are traditionally held by
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson, who is known as Rocky, is even a slice apart from
many other Salt Lake Democrats, an unabashed liberal and political
outsider who considers his civil libertarian roots a badge of
honor.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts here said his victory was achieved, in part,
through voter discomfort with Reid as a protege of Ms. Corradini,
whose second four-year term has been tainted by her involvement in
the Olympic bribery scandal and other personal financial matters.
They also said Anderson benefited from attacks late in the campaign
that accused him of having four former wives _ he has two _ and
owning two gay nightclubs, which he said he did not. The Reid
campaign denied any role in the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning for mayor, Anderson promised to tackle several
high-profile issues, not least making sure the city does not get
stuck with a bill for the 2002 Winter Olympics. Reid said he
believed the city was adequately protected.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has also promised to dismiss Police Chief Reuben
Ortega, restore morale in the police department and put into effect
after-school and job-training programs for young people. Reid had
said he would retain Ortega.
</P>
<P>
   As for his nickname, Anderson said it had no romantic base or
political symbolism as a fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother used to tease me about it,'' he said. ``As a kid, I
liked to be rocked.''

TEXAS TEEN RELEASED AFTER HALLOWEEN HORROR STORY LANDS HIM IN JAIL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Sub to include seventh grade in lede) 
 
By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christopher Beamon is back on the bricks, but the five days he
spent in jail for writing a Halloween horror story for a
seventh-grade English class has added a new dimension to the debate
over school safety in the wake of Columbine and Jonesboro.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has gone from confusion to absurdity to bizarre,'' said
William Short, the Dallas lawyer who managed to get his 13-year-old
client released from the Denton County jail Tuesday by calling the
case to the attention of the news media. ``Overreaction is the
nicest way you could phrase it.``
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile court records largely are sealed by law, but Short said
Beamon apparently was charged with ``writing a terroristic note and
threatening two kids and a teacher'' at his high school in Ponder,
a small town near Denton in North Texas, last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a note,'' he said. ``It was a story that was
assigned by the teacher. She gave them a setting _ you're in a dark
room and you hear a noise _ to build a story from. She told them to
make it ghoulish ... the most horrible thing you can think about.''
</P>
<P>
   Beamon's story, which he read in class, involved getting high on
Freon and shooting two classmates and ``Mrs. (Amanda) Henry,'' the
teacher who assigned the story.
</P>
<P>
   Henry would not comment on the incident, but a statement
released by the school superintendent, Dr. Byron Welch, said the
teacher and parents of some students in the class ``expressed
concerns'' about the content of the story ``that these students,
their parents and the teacher found threatening.'' County juvenile
authorities were then contacted, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, two deputy sheriffs visited the school and read
the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought it was serious enough to act on,'' said Chance
Allen, the principal.
</P>
<P>
   Beamon was taken downtown and made an appearance before Juvenile
Court Judge Darlene Whitten. Two assistant district attorney's
outlined the case against him, and the judge ordered him jailed.
The judge would not comment on the case, but Short said Beamon was
held without bail and a hearing on his case was not scheduled until
Nov. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``That judge was stupid,'' said Jason Ziedenburg, a policy
analyst at the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice in
Washington, D.C. ``But this kind of stuff is happening all over the
country. It's not just in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the school shootings at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., and Jonesboro, Ark., he said, there has been a
surge of expulsions and suspensions of students. Administrators, he
said, are more eager to involve the courts in cases that should be
handled by counselors.
</P>
<P>
   School shooting deaths have not increased since 1992, he said,
and children are safer in school than at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Educators have to have the highest standards,'' Ziedenburg
said. ``The easiest thing is to transfer their problems to the
criminal justice system. That is the lowest possible standard.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time Beamon was jailed, the judge appointed an attorney,
Kimberly McCary, to represent him and she was preparing a writ
seeking his release when Short was contacted by the boy's mother.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was outraged by what he heard and he called McCary
and told her, ``The world doesn't respond to writs of habeas
corpus, it responds to pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Short then contacted a Dallas television reporter and told him,
``I've got something you're going to be very interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, with reporters pouring into his office, Denton
County District Attorney Bruce Isaacks denied knowing anything
about the Beamon case. He later said he was not going to prosecute,
and the teen-ager was released.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like a year ago, a big ol' long year,'' Beamon said
as left the Juvenile Detention Center, wearing the clothes he had
worn for five days, and hungry for a burrito.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was crazy,'' said his mother, Jan Beamon.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Judge Whitten would not discuss the Beamon case,
but she said, ``There is some justification for parents to be
worried. Are we overreacting? This kind of thing merits serious
consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his English assignment has already cost him five days
of freedom, Ponder's school superintendent indicated in his written
statement Wednesday that the case may not be closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school is reviewing the matter and planning a hearing ...
with the Beamons to provide Chris with a chance to state his side
of this matter,'' his statement said. ``At that time, any
disciplinary actions by the district will be decided.''
</P>
<P>
   One tangent to the case provoked as much outrage as the jailing
of the teen-ager. It was widely reported that he received an ``A''
for his story, which was rife with misspellings and grammatical
errors, plus 100 bonus points for reading it in class.
</P>
<P>
   Not true, said Principal Allen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teacher never graded that paper,'' he said. ``She asked if
anyone wanted to read their story in class and one of the students
asked if they would get extra points.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she would give 100 bonus points to anyone who read
their story. She had not even read Chris' story. He got a grade for
the oral presentation, not for the story itself.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Arthur Levine, president of Teachers College at Columbia
University, met last year with Michael Milken, the fallen junk bond
king turned education entrepreneur, it was more than a case of the
old school meeting the new.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message was, `You guys are in trouble and we're going to
eat your lunch,''' Levine said, recalling what he considered not a
direct threat but a kind of predatory challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Milken, whose Knowledge Universe companies range from preschool
to corporate training, is not the only one who is hungry.
Businessmen like Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, and Lamar
Alexander, the erstwhile presidential hopeful and former governor
of Tennessee, are flocking to education, bringing with them a flood
of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   They say they will turn the $700 billion education sector into
``the next health care'' _ that is, transform large portions of a
fragmented, cottage industry of independent, nonprofit institutions
into a consolidated, professionally managed, money-making set of
businesses that include all levels of education, from preschool
through college and university work.
</P>
<P>
   While the for-profit education business has been evolving for
several years, with the establishment of Christopher C. Whittle's
Edison Schools and the University of Phoenix's college for working
adults, the transformation is now occurring on a far larger scale.
The dissatisfaction with public schools of parents of school-age
children and the demands of the economy are fueling a flow of
billions of dollars from corporations, pension funds and the
general public into for-profit educational ventures.
</P>
<P>
   For-profit companies are setting up law schools and new
elementary schools, training factory-floor employees to use
computers and taking over the operations of existing junior high
and high schools. Their motives, the companies say, are to wring
the waste from a system built largely on public largess and
nonprofit benevolence, turning it into an efficiently run and
profitable machine _ using investors' money instead of tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Changes in education are coming as surely as the Berlin Wall
went down,'' said William F. Weld, the former governor of
Massachusetts who is part of a group that has raised $150 million
to invest in for-profit education and training and which hopes to
raise another $100 million by early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, when he was governor, Weld encountered stiff
opposition to the concept of schools managed by for-profit
companies. This month, Edison Schools Inc., the Whittle brainchild
that operates 79 new and existing elementary and secondary schools
in 16 states, including Massachusetts, hopes to sell $170 million
in stock to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``These ideas would not have flown in 1991,'' Weld said.
``People just couldn't wrap their minds around it. Now we can't put
the genie back in the bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   Even institutions like New York University and the College Board
have formed for-profit subsidiaries to produce and market online
courses and other educational services, some of which might be the
source of public stock offerings.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the race to invest in education marks the triumph
of a market mentality that has consumed the United States in the
late 20th century. No longer is education, where institutions of
learning grew out of religion, the route to spiritual
enlightenment. For many students, it is the place to start a
business or accelerate their movement up the career ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's interest is the result of big societal changes
over the past generation. Nearly half of all students in higher
education today are over age 25, up from 28 percent in 1970. Many
of those students are seeking skills to change careers.
Corporations, meanwhile, no longer view training as a cost to
minimize but rather as a competitive advantage to exploit.
</P>
<P>
   As in health care, entrepreneurs assume that they will be able
to solve the intractable problems that have baffled government and
non-profit institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the business world, we've seen a movement toward the
hollowing out of the corporation to cut costs,'' said Guilbert C.
Hentschke, dean of the Rossier School of Education at the
University of Southern California. ``Now, in a sense, you've got
that same process in schools, where districts are entering
agreements for outsourcing, contracting for services and chartering
new schools.''
</P>
<P>
   But analysts warn that as Wall Street rushes in, investors might
find that the education business does not open itself to the free
market as willingly as did health care, utilities or other
industries that operated under longtime government regulations that
limited competition.

   Where for-profit enterprises have been introduced in education,
there is little evidence so far that students are performing
better, that high school graduates are getting better jobs or that
corporations are teaching skills that benefit the individual as
well as the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to impossible to determine if a for-profit
school is doing a better job than a comparable public school,''
said Henry M. Levin, a professor of economics and education who
heads the National Center for the Study of Privatization in
Education at Teachers College.

 &HT;    Judge gives government 2 weeks to release Branch Davidian
evidence
 &HT;    By Tommy Witherspoon
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ A federal judge in Waco has threatened to hold
government attorneys in contempt if they do not turn over all
federal evidence relating to the Branch Davidian siege within two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court is not unmindful that the government waits not only
until the last day, but until the last minute, to respond to every
order this court has issued. That practice causes the court to be
suspect of the government's desire to comply with its orders,''
U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. wrote in an order released
Tuesday rejecting a government motion for another month to finish
the task.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time the judge has threatened the
government with contempt in an effort to ensure compliance with his
August order that all government documents, tapes and other
materials relating to the Branch Davidian standoff be shipped to
the federal clerk's office in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   At the government's request, the judge has granted extensions to
give them more time to produce the documents. The last deadline
expired Monday, the same day government attorneys asked the judge
to postpone full compliance with his order until Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Calling that request ``unreasonable,'' Smith gave Michael
Bradford, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Texas, and
William Blagg, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Texas,
until 10 a.m. Nov. 15 to have all matters relating to the siege
delivered to the Waco courthouse or face a contempt hearing at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford's office was assigned the case after Blagg asked that
his office be recused.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's orders are intended to keep a wrongful-death lawsuit
filed by Branch Davidian survivors against the government on track
to begin May 15 and to prevent further delays.
</P>
<P>
   Sect leader David Koresh and 75 of his followers died in an
April 19, 1993, fire at Mount Carmel, ending a 51-day standoff with
government agents. The siege began Feb. 28, 1993, when agents with
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms tried to arrest Koresh
on federal firearms violations and were met with violent resistance
from inside the Mount Carmel compound near Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Four ATF agents and six sect members were killed in the
gunbattle.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the Branch Davidian survivors have alleged that
government agents fired into the compound on the final day, a claim
that the government has denied.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have said Koresh and his followers set the
fire and died in the inferno to fulfill Koresh's prophecies.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also noted in his order that ``it appears that the
Department of Justice has done nothing to assure the transfer of
those materials regarded as 'classified' by the Department of
Defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge said the Justice Department has done nothing to ensure
that there is a secure location at the courthouse to store the
classified documents, and set a Tuesday deadline for making
security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``If such arrangements are not made by Nov. 9, 1999, the court
will presume that the Department of Justice has waived its right to
complain about how such materials are stored in the Waco
courthouse,'' Smith wrote.

   So far, at least, ``private schools and those public schools
that are run by for-profit management typically seek students that
are not costly to educate,'' Levin said. ``That's not cheating.
They are playing by the rules of the game. They want to do a good
job, but they also want to make a profit. But the result is that
you can't really compare them with public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, if for-profit schools wish to expand they will
have to take in less capable students and investors might find
themselves on the same road as investors in HMOs several years ago.
Those organizations were initially able to cut costs by offering
services to groups of relatively healthy people _ employees of big
corporations, for example. But as HMOs began supplementing their
growth by recruiting less healthy individuals, costs rose,
profitability sank and investors faced big losses.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Apollo Group, parent of the University of
Phoenix, the country's largest private university, have been
profiting from education and raising money from the public for
several years. In addition, companies like DeVry Inc., ITT
Educational Services, Sylvan Learning Systems and General Physics
have long offered educational and training services to individuals
and corporations, and venture capital investors and companies like
Intel and Microsoft have been pouring money into educational
start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Newer investors, however, are viewing a much broader span of
learning as potential profit centers. An example is Knowledge
Universe, the conglomerate assembled by Milken. Among its companies
are Leapfrog Toys, a maker of reading and language products;
Knowledge Learning, a day-care chain; Teacher Universe, which
supports the use of technology in the classroom; MindQ Publishing,
which develops multimedia learning systems; and Productivity Point
International, which offers technology training for corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago this industry did not exist,'' said Scott L.
Soffen, a financial analyst at Legg Mason Wood Walker, an
investment firm in Baltimore. The success of some of the early
players _ Apollo, DeVry, the Learning Company _was so exceptional
that Wall Street was captivated, Soffen said. ``Nothing attracts
interest more than an industry group with momentum on Wall
Street.''
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity to make money in education certainly looks good.
The education and training industry accounts for 10 percent of the
U.S. economy, as measured by gross domestic product, according to
``The Book of Knowledge,'' a report issued last spring by Michael
T. Moe, director of global growth research at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   But education and training account for less than 0.2 percent of
the value of the domestic stock market _ $16 billion out of $10
trillion, so there is plenty of room for growth and for companies
to find profits in the education sector. Health care, by
comparison, represents 14 percent of GDP and a similar percentage
of the value of the United States stock market.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of private companies ready to soak up
investors' dollars, said Michael R. Sandler, chief executive of
EduVentures, an investment and consulting firm in Boston. Roughly
$6 billion has been invested in private education companies by
venture capital firms and other investors, he said, ``an enormous
amount of untapped market value.''
</P>
<P>
   Edison, the much-publicized effort by Whittle to build a better
public school, is a long way from profitability. In the year ended
June 30, the company lost $50.5 million on revenues of $132
million. Since its inception, Edison's losses total $113 million.
</P>
<P>
   By taking on the elementary and secondary school market, Edison
was somewhat unusual among for-profit education companies. Most
efforts are focused on areas where others have already forged
for-profit businesses and where it is likely to be far easier to
make money _ the sale of textbooks and school supplies, for
example, publication of learning materials, operation of preschools
and delivery of classes and test preparation services over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the areas where the partnership including Weld hopes
to succeed. The group, known as Leeds Equity Partners III, will be
managed by Jeffrey T. Leeds and Robert A. Bernstein, two former
investment bankers at Lazard Freres &AMP; Co. who were among the early
investors in Edison Schools. On the group's board of advisers are
Thomas F. McLarty III, the former chief of staff for President
Clinton, and Lamar Alexander, the former governor of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really like the post-secondary part of the education
business,'' Leeds said. He said he believed that schools providing
professional training and certification _ in business, law,
psychology, even medicine _ could be operated for-profit. If that
training could take place over the Internet, serving students who
cannot take time off from work or travel to a central campus, all
the better, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, education stocks have badly trailed the market. The best
investments have been those companies that offered computer-based
training _ companies like CBT Group and Learning Tree
International.
</P>
<P>
   If primary and secondary school makes for a tough market,
however, the need to constantly upgrade the skills of workers means
that the most promising for-profit sectors are those where people
need more education, after they have finished high school or
college and entered the work force, said Arthur Levine, the
president of Teachers College.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether these companies can do a better job of
educating people,'' he said. ``But they are the most aggressive and
creative actors in higher education today. Some of them have shown
they can make a profit. And that means that much of this industry
is up for grabs.''  &QL;

CLINTON VETOES GOP SPENDING BILL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As promised, President Clinton vetoed a Republican
plan for financing education, labor and social programs as White
House aides and congressional leaders returned to the bargaining
table Wednesday to complete a federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which Clinton said is laden with the GOP's
``misguided priorities and mindless cuts,'' is the fifth spending
bill he has vetoed, or plans to veto, of 13 approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress ... must produce the right kind of budget, a budget
that reflects the values of our people,'' the president said during
a Rose Garden appearance at which he announced his veto of the $314
billion bill narrowly approved a day earlier by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the bill failed to provide money to hire more
teachers, instead sending the funds directly to states and local
school districts to use for other programs. He also criticized
Republicans for using the measure to impose a 1 percent spending
cut in all other areas of the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``We value fiscal responsibility,'' Clinton said, ``but this
bill abdicates that responsibility by imposing across-the-board
cuts that clearly will damage vital priorities, even as the
Republican majority has larded the budget with wasteful projects.''
</P>
<P>
   Without naming anyone, Clinton also accused some Republicans of
undercutting their negotiators and slowing budget talks. ``Whenever
we make an agreement, then there's an attempt by some in the
Congress to pull them back to the right,'' the president said. ``We
will never reach agreement unless there is honorable compromise.
That is always found in the center.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders were quick to defend the proposed spending
cut and criticized Clinton's rejection of the legislation.
``Ultimately, the president's veto today is a defeat for common
sense,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, dismissed the
president's assertion that congressional Republicans were being
wasteful by specifying, or earmarking, funds for certain projects
for their home districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have the Congress of one party and the White House of
another party, the way that you dictate spending is through
earmarks,'' DeLay said. ``Most of these earmarks are the Republican
Congress telling the executive branch how to spend the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of fun to run around and scream and yell about
pork, but most of these projects are very important to the
communities that they're going to,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, White House budget chief Jack Lew returned to the
Capitol late Wednesday to resume negotiations, focusing first on
foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   When some Republican leaders indicated a willingness to go along
with the administration's request for more money to help Israel and
the Palestinians implement the Wye peace accords, some GOP
conservatives _ led by DeLay _ launched fresh attacks on the
president.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, who has not been included in the closed-door talks with
the White House, said that ``listening to the protests from the
White House and the World Bank, one would guess that the Congress
had cut foreign aid entirely. But that isn't the case at all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course the Democrats are touting all of their usual
doomsday forecasts, but if the president and congressional
Democrats want more spending, they need to tell us how to pay for
it,'' DeLay said, adding that Republicans are not going to agree to
a raid on the Social Security surplus or any tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   He accused the White House and congressional Democrats of
wanting to raid the Social Security trust fund to pay for foreign
aid. ``The real disgrace is the suggestion that this government
should rob the Social Security surplus to underwrite the national
debt of Nepal,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leadership has set next Wednesday as a target for finishing
the budget and adjourning for the year. That is the day before
Clinton is to depart on a European trip. That timetable would allow
several lawmakers to keep overseas travel plans of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota was
skeptical about meeting the Wednesday deadline. ``There isn't any
kind of drop-dead date or any kind of particular deadline that we
have to meet for any other reason,'' he told reporters. ``We've got
to get our work done.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government sued seven giant electric
companies in the Midwest and the South on Wednesday, accusing the
utilities of defying anti-pollution regulations and illegally
contaminating the air breathed by millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The government took action against 32 coal-fired plants in 10
states, saying that if the plants reduced pollution as required it
would have the same effect as taking 26 million cars off the road.
</P>
<P>
   The government accused the companies of modernizing their
generating plants without modernizing their pollution controls as
required by the Clean Air Act, which exempts many old power plants
from the law's toughest requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department filed the lawsuits on behalf of the
Environmental Protection Agency. The government contends that 17
power plants run by the companies have fouled the atmosphere for
years and have contributed ``to some of the most severe
environmental problems facing the United States today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When children have trouble breathing because of pollution from
a utility plant hundreds of miles away, something must be done,''
Attorney General Janet Reno said. The civil suits, which seek to
fine the companies and force them to install modern anti-pollution
equipment, were filed in U.S District Court in five Midwestern and
Southern cities.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA administrator, Carol Browner, said the seven defendants
had committed ``very, very significant violations of the Clean Air
Act,'' an accusation that the utilities immediately denounced.
</P>
<P>
   Browner said the companies had illegally retooled old,
pollution-spewing coal plants without notifying regulators, getting
the necessary permits and installing expensive new equipment to
reduce emissions and meet pollution standards that apply to new
plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They chose not to,'' Browner said, ``because they knew that if
they did they'd have to reduce their pollution, and they didn't
want to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The utilities' motive, she added, was to prolong the lives of
the old plants and to avoid the cost of building new plants because
of the tough, modern standards.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants denounced the government's action. ``We regret
that the agency has again demonstrated that it prefers headlines
and confrontation over consensus-building,'' said Dale Heydlauff, a
vice president of American Electric Power of Columbus, Ohio. ``We
are fully prepared to vigorously defend against these allegations,
and we believe we will prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the lawsuits, the government took administrative
action against the Tennessee Valley Authority, accusing the agency
of similar violations at seven of its plants. And it issued
violation notices _ possible precursors to additional suits _
accusing the seven electric utilities of pollution violations at
eight other plants.
</P>
<P>
   The government's actions Wednesday are the latest volley in a
long-running battle over the air pollution that starts in the
Midwest and drifts on the wind toward the highly polluted New York
region and on to New England. Northeastern states and the federal
government have argued that unless new controls are imposed in the
Midwest, the chronic air pollution problems of the Northeast can
never be cured. But they have met mixed success in their efforts to
solve the problem with new air pollution regulations, which always
end up being challenged in court.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits brought immediate praise from environmental groups.
``This is a major and much-needed enforcement action,'' said Frank
O'Donnell, executive director of the Clean Air Trust, in a typical
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever side prevails, it was clear Wednesday that a
fundamental dispute is over definitions _ most importantly, the
difference between major renovations and ``routine maintenance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clean Air Act of 1970 sets strict standards for new
pollution sources, in this instance power plants, and much looser
ones for older sources. The older sources are ``grandfathered,''
meaning that they can continue to operate with relatively minor
improvements as long as their owners do not undertake major
renovations, in which case the plants are supposed to come under
the strict new standards.
</P>
<P>
   Browner said about 100 EPA investigators working over the last
two years had uncovered many instances in which the utilities had
embarked on big capital improvements, then tried to pass them off
as routine maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one plant they spent $60 million for five new furnaces,''
Browner said. ``That's hardly routine maintenance.''
</P>
<P>
   Or is it? Lawyers for the utilities are likely to argue that
spending millions of dollars to improve a decades-old plant could
be construed as ``routine maintenance,'' especially if the
alternative is to spend hundreds of millions on a new plant.
</P>
<P>
   Peter H. Lehner, chief of the New York Attorney General's
Environmental Protection Bureau, said both sides would recruit
experts to argue points like that. ``If it's routine maintenance,
we lose,'' he said. ``If it's not, they lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Attorney General's office has been preparing
similar lawsuits against some of the same defendants named in the
federal suits lodged Wednesday, and Lehner said his office would
work closely with lawyers in Washington.

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
SALT LAKE CITY _ There have been times when the Rockets have
gathered after practice, as teams everywhere do, and broken apart
with a word shouted in unison. It's pretty elementary stuff, so
much so that it's probably common at most elementary schools.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But for a while, Shandon Anderson struggled with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd bring it in and say, `One, two, three ,' and out of
instinct I'd start to say Jazz,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   He will have no such trouble tonight, when Anderson will make
his first return to the Delta Center as a Rocket for a game against
Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson might, by habit, begin to stride past the visitors'
locker room or head to the home bench. But once he takes the court
and is in public view, he will quickly be reminded he is no longer
part of the home team.
</P>
<P>
   ``In playoff basketball, you get that hostile environment,''
Anderson said. ``That's how it is up there year-round. It's going
to be tough. You have to stay focused and play your game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say it's going to be just a game. It's going to be
something special. At the same time, it's a division game. We both
lost a game (on Tuesday). It's going to be important for us to get
a win, especially on the road in a hostile environment like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, the Jazz's second-round pick in the 1996 draft, played
three seasons for Utah before signing with the Rockets as a free
agent for roughly half of his former team's offer.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, 25, immediately became the starting shooting guard for
the Jazz's Midwest Division rivals. But just in case that were not
enough to incite the Delta Center fans against him, Jazz owner
Larry Miller announced that Anderson had an objection to the local
``lifestyle,'' a claim sure to offend, even though Anderson says he
never said it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, he tried to make it seem like I was a bad guy,''
Anderson said. ``I never said anything negative about the city or
the team. We kept everything on the aspect of playing. It was a
good three years for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing is they had a problem with me not coming in at
all (to negotiate). To me, that's my agent's job. I don't think I'm
going to get into a battle with him (Miller) or anybody in the city
about things I feel personally that are best for me. I just felt
like it was time for me to move on. They didn't go to (former vice
president) Scott Layden and say, `Why is Scott leaving?' When I
decided to leave, it was a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said his decision to leave the Jazz was not based on
any problem with the city but on a feeling the time was right to
move on. He wanted a greater role and more responsibility, to move
closer to his Atlanta home and to find a team with a young nucleus
that can develop with him.
</P>
<P>
   Lifestyle didn't make the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a feeling we all get inside sometimes that we need a
change,'' Anderson said. ``I don't know what causes it. But at a
certain time in your life, you're like, `Man, I need to do
something different. I need a change of scenery.' It just so
happened it came up when I was a free agent. I didn't want to look
back and say, `Oh, I wish I made that change.' I made it, and I
won't look back and say I should have stayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's lifestyle. Anybody will tell you, you won't
see me out partying every night. This is a good situation for me.
It puts me closer to my family, an hour-and-a-half flight away, but
not too close. At the same time, it puts me with guys my age I can
play with and grow with.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans in the Delta Center, however, will not consider that, and
Anderson knows how rough they can be. But he believes he will be
able to forget them and the fact his whole career, save one game,
has been with the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Rocket now,'' Anderson said. ``If they boo me, I've had
that since I've played in the NBA. I'll just go on and play my
game. I bonded with those guys very well. At the same time, I had
to do what I felt would make me happy. At first it's going to be
like, `Oh, I'm not in that uniform.' After that, I have to play
with the team I'm with now.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockets teammate Charles Barkley said, however, that Anderson is
kidding himself. Having been there, Barkley said the first game
against a former team cannot be an ordinary game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always get caught up in it,'' said Barkley, who had 33
rebounds in his first game with the Rockets against the Suns. ``I
was in his situation. He's going to get caught up in it. He can say
whatever he wants to. He wants to win that game more than any other
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to stay calm. You want to show them what they have
been missing. It's a double-edged sword. You don't want to come out
overly aggressive. You don't want to be passive, either. You'll
definitely have great emotions. They'll definitely be on his case.
The only way to shut them up is to play well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made great sacrifices to come here,'' Barkley said. ``I
would love to win the game for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson will take it, especially now that he remembers to
shout, ``Rockets!'' at the right times.

IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, BUSH IS THE IMAGE OF SCRAPPINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By FRANK BRUNI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEREDITH, N.H. _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas Wednesday wrapped
up a feverishly busy visit to New Hampshire that saw him log
hundreds of road miles, lunge for every hand in his path and, above
all, look less like a carefree front-runner than a scrappy
contender who had indeed broken a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   That is probably just the image that Bush wanted to project. As
he rode by bus through remote rural areas and made himself
available for extended question-and-answer sessions in hamlet after
hamlet, Bush seemed to be issuing, in word and deed, an emphatic
rebuttal of charges that he was taking victory in the Republican
presidential primary here _ or anywhere else _ for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Without audiences' even asking him about it, Bush repeatedly
defended his decision to skip a Republican candidates forum in
Hanover last week so that he could attend a ceremony in Dallas at
which his wife, Laura, was getting an award.
</P>
<P>
   And he repeatedly assured New Hampshire residents that he
realized that a candidate had to ask them directly for their votes.
He made a similar case to the pack of reporters who rode in a bus
trailing Bush's own.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is retail politics, and I like retail politics,'' Bush
said here Wednesday morning, at the conclusion of a day and a half
of campaigning. ``I've got a lot of work to do in the state of New
Hampshire, and I understand that, and I'll be here. I'll be here a
lot, shaking hands and answering questions and working hard.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I was emphasizing that before this trip. I mean,
this is a state where you have to ask for the vote, and I'm asking,
and I've been asking since mid-June, and I'm going to keep asking
up until election time.''
</P>
<P>
   But the urgency of that request has arguably changed. In the
last few weeks, several polls have showed one of Bush's rivals for
the Republican presidential nomination, Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, pulling closer to Bush in New Hampshire, where McCain and
other candidates have spent considerably more time than Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Although advisers said that Bush's trip here had been planned
many weeks ago, aspects of the visit nonetheless seemed to address
some of the criticisms that rivals and pundits have aimed at Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Not socially conservative enough? Bush delivered an education
policy speech in Gorham on Tuesday that urged abstinence and
voluntary prayer in classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Floating above the fray? Bush mixed it up for hours on end with
voters, opening himself wide to any and all questions and
exhibiting a manner that mixed confidence with humility.
</P>
<P>
   Asked on Tuesday night about the qualities he would want in a
vice president, Bush said, ``I take a question about a vice
presidential pick and it sounds like I take something for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't. I've got a lot of work to do.'' That said, Bush
ventured that one of the most important attributes would be
loyalty, and he cited as an example a former rival for the
Republican nomination, Dan Quayle, who was the vice president under
Bush's father.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bush managed not only to deliver an education policy
speech in Gorham but also to hit Dixville Notch and Colebrook
before the address and Littleton and Meredith following it. He drew
large, enthusiastic crowds wherever he went.
</P>
<P>
   There were, however, a few hints of strain, most notably when he
fielded a question from someone in Gorham about the economic hopes
for rural areas and what role the Internet might play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of the new economy is going to create all sorts of
interesting opportunities and problems,'' Bush said, in an answer
that lasted about four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interesting opportunities are, capital will move freely
when we're a global nation, in a global world,'' he continued.
``We're a nation in a global world. The ability to communicate _
and capital to move quickly because of the new economy _ is
changing the nature of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked at one of his next stops about homosexuality, Bush said he
favored the ``don't-ask, don't-tell'' policy of the military but
opposed gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all sinners, buddy,'' he said to the man who posed the
question. ``And far be it from me to cast the first stone. But I
don't think people ought to be married who are gay. I believe
marriage is meant for men and women. That's what I believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, at a Chamber of Commerce breakfast in
Meredith, he was asked about foreign policy, and his long, detailed
answer considered China and Israel, Russia and Kosovo, immigration
policy and trade pacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm giving you more of an answer than you want,'' Bush
acknowledged, ``but I'm unloading.''
</P>
<P>
   He unloaded some more a few minutes later when a reporter asked
if he regretted missing last week's debate, a question he had
already answered in various ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know something?'' Bush said. ``The number of people that
have walked up to me this trip and said, `I appreciate you standing
by your wife's side,' was a lot of people. People can accept me for
who I am. I hope they do. But if they thought my decision was not
the right decision _ to stand by my wife's side _ there are other
candidates they can choose from.''

 &HT;    Utilities sued over pollution
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In one of its heaviest environmental enforcement
actions, the U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday filed a massive
lawsuit against Georgia Power Co. and its sister utility Alabama
Power Co.
</P>
<P>
   The government charges the utilities illegally modified
coal-burning plants, causing the release of huge amounts of air
pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   Also named as a plaintiff in the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District
Court in Atlanta on behalf of the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, was Southern Co. Services, which controls the distribution
of electricity produced at the plants. All three firms are owned by
the Atlanta-based Southern Co.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks to force Georgia Power to install stricter air
pollution control technology at two of its biggest coal-fired
plants: Bowen in Bartow County and Scherer in Monroe County.
Alabama Power would have to take similar action at three of its
plants.
</P>
<P>
   The companies could face civil penalties of as much as $25,000
for each day of violation at each plant before Jan. 30, 1997, and
$27,000 for each day thereafter. Since many of the alleged
violations began in the late 1970s, the utilities could face tens
of millions of dollars in fines if the court rules in favor of the
EPA.
</P>
<P>
   Similar lawsuits were filed Wednesday in Indianapolis, Tampa,
Fla., East St. Louis, Ill., and Columbus, Ohio, against 12 other
coal-fired electric plants and six utility companies that own the
plants.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate enforcement action, the Tennessee Valley Authority
was accused of similar violations at seven of its plants.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits contend Georgia Power and the other utilities
upgraded their aging coal-powered plants to generate more
electricity, but failed to install equipment to control additional
emissions of pollutants that cause smog and acid rain in violation
of the federal Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's action will help clean the air and make us breathe a
little easier,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said at a news
conference in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Joining her was EPA Administrator Carol Browner, who said, ``By
ensuring that these plants obey the law, we are not just helping
their immediate communities achieve cleaner air. We are helping
almost the entire eastern half of the United States, because air
pollution does not stop at state borders.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Power and Southern Co. officials Wednesday called the
allegations in the lawsuit absurd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident that there is absolutely no substantive basis
for this enforcement action,'' company spokesman Tal Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Wright said Southern Co. and Georgia Power, which serves 1.8
million customers in all but six of Georgia's 159 counties,
cooperated closely with the EPA during the yearlong investigation
that led to the lawsuit. ``We have provided more than 120,000 pages
of documentation and have been on call to answer questions in an
effort to be up front and open,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups, who have long battled Georgia Power over
emissions from its coal-burning plants, applauded the federal
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for all power plants throughout the country to meet
modern pollution standards,'' said Rita Kilpatrick of the Campaign
for a Prosperous Georgia, a ratepayer watchdog group. ``These
allegations are a company shareholder problem, and if proven to be
true and the company is penalized, the shareholders _ not the
ratepayers _ must bear the burden of any unlawful acts.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Mark Woodall of the Georgia Sierra Club, ``The Southern
Company has been investing billions in foreign electric plants;
perhaps some of that money should be invested here at home to
protect us from dirty air.''
</P>
<P>
   When Congress passed the Clean Air Act in the 1970s, it exempted
the nation's older coal-fired plants from meeting tough standards
applied to new facilities _ as long as the plants maintained the
status quo. Lawmakers believed the old plants would eventually be
replaced by newer, cleaner technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The older facilities were allowed to perform routine maintenance
but were not allowed to make significant changes.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawsuits filed Wednesday allege the companies greatly
expanded their power-generating capacity and thus should meet the
tighter pollution standards of new plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies spent hundreds of millions of dollars
modifying these plants _ increasing the life of these plants and
increasing their emissions _ without applying for pollution control
technology,'' Browner of the EPA said.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the EPA alleges the coal-fired plants illegally
emitted excess amounts of nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and
particulate matter, which includes soot, dust and other ultrafine
specks of matter, because additional emissions controls were not
installed.
</P>
<P>
   Nitrogen oxides can produce ozone, the level of which exceeds
federal standards in metro Atlanta in the summer. Sulfur dioxide
may cause acid rain, and particulate matter _ another component of
smog _ can be inhaled deeply in the lungs and possibly cause
premature death.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits did not specify how much excess pollution each
plant has illegally emitted since they were upgraded, but Browner
said it is in the tens of millions of tons, leading to adverse
impacts on health and the environment. The amounts for each plant
are expected to be presented as evidence in court.
</P>
<P>
   Browner said controlling the sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides
from the plants could lead to 85 percent and 95 percent reductions,
respectively, in the pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate action, the Georgia Environmental Protection
Division is requiring the two Georgia Power plants named in the
lawsuit Wednesday, as well as five other coal-fired plants
(Hammond, Yates, Wansley, McDonough and Branch) owned by the
utility, to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by more than 400 tons a
day in order to clean up metro Atlanta's smog-laden air by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The state also is requiring additional restrictions on emissions
from automobiles, factories and other sources.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Power said the upgrades of its power plants will cost
the utility _ and perhaps its customers _ up to $857 million.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Power is committed to spending more than $500 million to
clean up emissions at the Hammond, Bowen, Yates, Wansley and
McDonough plants north and west of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But the company is balking at installing additional controls on
two of its huge facilities: Scherer, and Branch in Putnam County.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials say emissions from the two plants have a
negligible impact on Atlanta's air.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's coal-burning plants are under attack by environmental
groups for other pollutants, including mercury and excess amounts
of carbon dioxide that may contribute to global warming.

 (ATTN: Calif.)  
 Coffey named head of CNNfn BUSINESS NEWS  
(js) 
 By BILL CARTER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CNNfn, the financial news cable channel operated by Cable News
Network, on Wednesday named Shelby Coffey III, the former editor of
The Los Angeles Times and current executive vice president of ABC
News, as its new president, ending a long effort to fill the
position.
</P>
<P>
   Coffey, who will assume the job on Nov. 15, was most recently in
charge of the standards and practices area of ABC News, where he
dealt with issues of what constituted proper and ethical news
coverage as well as the network's Internet operation, ABC News.com.
</P>
<P>
   In his new position in the increasingly competitive area of
financial news, Coffey will lead CNNfn, a 5-year-old cable channel
that delivers business news to about 12 million homes, and all of
the business news coverage by CNN itself. The job was previously
held by Lou Dobbs, who was also an on-the-air anchor of CNN's most
profitable show, ``Moneyline.'' Dobbs left the network in June.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbs' departure left a critical hole in the CNN hierarchy at a
time when CNNfn is competing for financial news viewers with CNBC,
the current leader in financial news on cable television. The
battle so far has been one-sided, with CNBC in 71 million U.S homes
to CNNfn's 12 million.
</P>
<P>
   Coffey, who has a limited television background and no direct
hands-on business news experience, was not CNN's first choice. Paul
E. Steiger, the managing editor of The Wall Street Journal, turned
down the job last month, after many weeks of courtship.
</P>
<P>
   Coffey, who is 53, will report to Tom Johnson, the chairman of
CNN News Group, not Rick Kaplan, the network's top news executive
as president of CNN/USA, who had a tense relationship with Dobbs.
Johnson said Wednesday that following Steiger's decision, he
thought quickly of Coffey, whom he had hired twice before _ once to
be editor of The Dallas Times Herald and then to be editor of The
Los Angeles Times. In both instances, Johnson was publisher of the
paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to look for a person who was a very strong, credible
journalist who was going to lead a 370-person staff,'' Johnson
said. ``I needed strong professional leadership from someone who
had a big business background.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he had moved away from his initial consideration of
magazine and newspaper editors who specialized in business news and
instead looked to Coffey because he has ``a broad background and
had managed a complex news organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Coffey has never specialized in business news but he said he had
``an intense interest'' in the subject. He added that while in
charge of The Los Angeles Times, he had supervised the paper's
expansion of business coverage. He cited the growth of the Silicon
Valley computer industry and the downsizing of the aerospace
industry as two major business stories the newspaper had
extensively reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think CNN has been in the forefront of changing the approach
to financial news coverage,'' Coffey said, mentioning a shift
toward coverage of personal finance and investing. ``The entire
economy is endlessly fascinating.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Johnson said he will look to Coffey to lead CNNfn to growth both
in the United States and globally. Johnson said he hoped CNNfn
could narrow the gap with CNBC when cable systems go to a digital
process that will greatly expand channel capacity. Meanwhile, he
said, he hopes to use CNN's large international presence to help
build CNNfn's global reach. CNN International is in 150 million
homes worldwide. CNBC is, according to NBC executives, in 99
million homes around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Coffey's career in television began in June 1998, when he joined
ABC, following a long career in newspapers. That began at The
Washington Post, where he was most memorably editor of the Style
section. Besides his positions in Dallas and Los Angeles, he was
also briefly editor of U.S. News and World Report.
</P>
<P>
   Coffey was hired at ABC by David Westin, who himself was newly
named to the job of president of ABC News, after serving in top
management jobs in ABC's legal and corporate divisions. Westin said
Wednesday that despite never having worked in television before,
Coffey's ``strong journalism credentials'' were very helpful to
him.
</P>
<P>
   Westin said he happily allowed Coffey to pursue the CNNfn
position despite having about 18 months left on his ABC contract.
``I knew it was a great opportunity for him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, ``We were in the process of redefining Shelby's
responsibilities,'' Westin said. ``We were in a little bit of a
transition period.''

INDONESIAN BANK AGENCY IS READY TO CONFRONT BIG DEBTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WAYNE ARNOLD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ Paralyzed for three months by a scandal that still
threatens its chairman, the agency in charge of rescuing
Indonesia's ravaged financial industries is preparing a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency, armed with a team of
lawyers and the backing of the military, says it is at last
prepared to start seizing the assets of politically powerful
debtors who have refused to repay loans they owe to the nation's
banks. And with a democratically elected new government in office
giving legitimacy to politically difficult changes, the agency says
the time is right to speed up the sale of assets it has accumulated
during its nearly two years in operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to take advantage of the momentum,'' said Eko S.
Budianto, the deputy chairman and head of the asset management
division. ``With the government now in place, we feel that the
environment is more conducive for sales like this to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Reasserting its authority, however, is likely to test the reform
credentials of the new government of President Abdurrahman Wahid.
The International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday that the way was
clear to resume its $43 billion economic assistance package to
Indonesia after the release of an audit into the misappropriation
of millions of dollars paid by the bank-restructuring agency to
Bank Bali, a commercial bank _ money that ended up in the accounts
of dozens of government and ruling-party officials. On Wednesday,
the I.M.F. urged the government to strengthen the agency to prevent
further such abuses.
</P>
<P>
   But influential politicians are wrangling over whether the
bank-restructuring agency should be freer of political meddling or
instead made more accountable. Amid the debate, rumors persist that
its chairman, Glenn Yusuf, will be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   The senior economics minister, Kwik Kian Gie, moved to dispel
those rumors Wednesday, telling a news conference in Jakarta that
the government had no plans to replace Yusuf.
</P>
<P>
   But Kwik's statements underscored the bank agency's
controversial role in Indonesia's recovery. Established at the
depths of the financial crisis as a condition of IMF aid, it has
taken control of almost 50 banks and gained stakes in roughly 200
companies, giving it $84 billion in assets. Much of that must be
sold to help pay for the bailout of Indonesian banks. But roughly
40 percent of these assets consist of nonperforming loans, most
owed by big corporations with political connections to former
President Suharto and his Golkar party, members of which now sit in
Wahid's new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Overseeing the agency is a staff of would-be untouchables headed
by Yusuf and empowered by a new law that gives them the right to
foreclose on debtors without going through the courts. Since they
began putting pressure on Suharto's family and associates to pay
up, Eko says the agency has faced threats and intimidation from
both business executives and cabinet ministers. An army major even
arrived at the agency's downtown Jakarta offices carrying a grenade
and a machine gun, Eko recalled.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But no form of opposition has been as harmful to the agency as
the scandal over Bank Bali, which undermined its credibility.
</P>
<P>
   When the scandal spread in August, the banking agency's staff
became preoccupied with guiding auditors through files and fielding
investigators' questions. Debtors took advantage of the
distraction. Loan repayments dropped by more than half and the
scandal halted billions of dollars in interbank loan repayments,
raising the cost of the bailout as unpaid interest accrued.
</P>
<P>
   It also cast suspicion over Yusuf. His appointment last year as
chairman was criticized as a conflict of interest _ he previously
headed the government-owned investment bank that continues to
advise the bank-restructuring agency. Since then, though, he had
gained the respect and trust of the IMF and of foreign investors of
the sort Indonesia needs to lure back.
</P>
<P>
   But Yusuf's rapport with Western financiers was a mixed
blessing. Some Indonesians accused him of selling out the country,
and this week legislators assailed reported attempts by the U.S.
ambassador, Robert S. Gelbard, to persuade the new finance minister
to retain him. Still, foreign experts say there are few other
Indonesians with Yusuf's kind of experience to run the banking
agency.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Bank Bali and the agency will remain an
important matter in any inquiry. The audit recommends further
investigation of the central bank governor and the former finance
minister. Advocates of the agency, which reports to the ministry of
finance, are proposing that it instead report directly to the
president. It ``needs to be given teeth,'' said William Belchere of
Merrill Lynch in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Others want the agency overhauled to make it more accountable to
Indonesia's newly elected leaders, a move that supporters worry
could subvert its independence.
</P>
<P>
   With ``a different set of personnel in charge, the process of
bank restructuring and collection of bad loans would be delayed,''
said Takahira Ogawa, Asia-Pacific director of sovereign ratings at
Standard &AMP; Poor's, which estimates the cost of the Indonesian bank
bailout at more than three-quarters of the nation's total output.
``That would affect the entire recovery of the financial sector and
the economy,'' he said.

WOMEN MAKE RAPID GAINS IN RECEIVING DOCTORAL DEGREES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The annual total of women receiving doctorates has increased by
more than 50 percent in a decade, growing at over twice the rate of
the number of men getting those degrees, a new study has found.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a record 40.6 percent of more than 42,000 research
doctorates awarded by U.S. universities in the 1996-97 academic
year went to women, according to the annual study, by the National
Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago. The study
measures only research degrees, not professional degrees in
medicine and law.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of research doctorates awarded to members of
minorities was also a record, rising to 9 percent of all doctorates
and 14.2 percent of those given to U.S. citizens. In the latter
category, blacks accounted for 5 percent of doctorates, Hispanics
for 3.8 percent, Asian-Americans for 4.9 percent and American
Indians for 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The gains by women and members of minorities reflect not only
more active recruitment of them by universities but also an
increase in their numbers within doctoral programs as a result of
normal cycles in the nation's economy, said Allen Sanderson, senior
research scientist at the National Opinion Research Center and
senior lecturer in economics at the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   University enrollments generally run counter to economic cycles,
rising in bad economic times and falling in better environments as
jobs become plentiful. Most doctoral students in the study spent
about seven years earning the degree, meaning that many entered
their doctoral programs just as the economy was slipping into
recession in mid-1990.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the relative influence of these factors, the 17,322
doctorates awarded to women in 1997 were more than half again as
many as the 11,432 given them in 1987. The rate of growth far
surpassed that of men, who received 24,999 research doctorates in
1997, as against 20,938 10 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent such gains achieved by women are in keeping with
a long upward trend in their share of doctorates, which in turn
followed a period of decline. Doctorates awarded to women rose
briefly above 20 percent in 1945, because World War II, with large
numbers of men in the armed services, saw an increase in the
proportion of female graduate students.
</P>
<P>
   After the advent of the GI Bill, though, that proportion
decreased, and women received just 9.1 percent of the doctorates
awarded in 1954, the lowest total since the collection of such data
began in 1921. The percentage of female degree recipients doubled
from 1954 to 1974, rising to 19.5 percent of the total, then
doubled again in another 20 years, to 38.6 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that in 1997, the total number of doctorates
earned grew for the 12th straight year, extending a string of gains
not seen since the rapid annual growth in graduate-student ranks in
the late 1960s and early 1970s, when students were given an
exemption from the military draft. From 1987 to 1997, the study
said, the yearly total of doctorates awarded grew by a third.
</P>
<P>
   But the rate of growth in 1997 alone, 0.7 percent, was the
lowest since 1985, meaning perhaps that the long economic boom is
drawing potential students away from study and into the work force.
</P>
<P>
   The number of science and engineering doctorates fell by 1
percent in 1997, though that is a decline that might well be
reversed among graduates five years or so down the road, given the
Internet boom.

TECHNOLOGY ISSUES LEAD NASDAQ TO 5TH CONSECUTIVE RISE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Technology stocks propelled the Nasdaq composite
index to a fifth consecutive advance and its first close at more
than 3,000 points Wednesday, extending a gain that in just slightly
more than two weeks totals 12.7 percent. It was the market's fourth
busiest session on record.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index finished at 3,028.51, up 46.88
points, or 1.57 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other major averages made only small gains, however, as
investors and traders awaited the government's report on the
October job market, set for release on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average edged up 27.22 points, to
10,609.06.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index climbed 7.19 points, to
1,354.93, as General Electric rose 2 15/16 a share, to 131 3/8;
Intel jumped 2 3/16, to 79 11/16, and American Home Products
climbed 5|, to 56. American Home is discussing a merger with
Warner-Lambert, which also rose 5| a share, to 83 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Other drug stocks also attracted buyers: Schering-Plough rose
more than 2 3/16 a share while Bristol-Myers, Johnson &AMP; Johnson and
Merck all rose more than 1.
</P>
<P>
   High-technology carried the day, buoyed by Qualcomm's
announcement of quadrupled profits and a 4-for-1 split and by
bullish talk at technology conferences sponsored by Prudential
Securities and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's saying business is somewhere between good and
booming,'' said Greg Smith, chief investment strategist for
Prudential. He cited word this week that Ford and General Motors
have formed Internet-based partnerships with Oracle and Commerce
One, respectively, to facilitate purchases from suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle jumped 4\ a share, to 57 5/16 Wednesday while Commerce
One soared 46 15/16, to 254 13/16. Qualcomm, already the
best-performing stock in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index this
year, surged another 29 11/16, to 260 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commercial storage and business-to-business e-commerce just
continue to rocket,'' said W. Shannon Reid, senior portfolio
manager at First Capital Group.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates continued to ease Wednesday as the government
reported that factory orders fell in September for the first time
in five months, more evidence that the economy is finally slowing
from its rapid pace.
</P>
<P>
   This tended to support the view that the Federal Reserve, which
has a policy meeting set for Nov. 16, will need to make no more
than one more monetary tightening and could avoid making any.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, said David G. Sowerby, a market strategist at
Loomis Sayles in Detroit, ``stocks could weaken'' if the Labor
Department on Friday reports strong job growth or a further decline
in the 4.2 percent unemployment rate, matching the lowest in a
generation.
</P>
<P>
   The session also featured another popular initial public
offering. Be Free, a Massachusetts company that provides Internet
marketing services for online merchants, offered 5.6 million shares
at 12. The stock traded as high as 36\ before closing at 29. A
total of 13.6 million changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco stocks benefited from a signal that Florida's highest
court might head off a huge damage award in a class-action suit by
smokers against the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Small-capitalization stocks continued their recent rebound. The
Russell 2000 climbed 1.4 percent, or 6.07 points, to 438.46, while
the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 600 small companies moved up 1.21
percent to push just above break-even for the year. The Russell
2,000 is up 3.91 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange remained heavy, expanding
to 914.4 million from 904.6 million on Tuesday.

COACH OF US WOMEN'S SOCCER TEAM STEPPING DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tony DiCicco, who directed the US women's soccer team to the
Olympic gold medal and World Cup title during the past three years,
is resigning to spend more time with his wife and four sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason I'm stepping down is that it's more important
for me to be a world-class husband and father than a world-class
coach,'' said the 51-year-old DiCicco, who would have spent most of
next year away from home preparing for the Summer Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I looked at the generous financial opportunities
available to me next year, I didn't see how they could possibly
enrich my life more than spending time with my wife and boys.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco, whose 103-8-8 record (25-2-2 this year) is the best of
any coach in US soccer history, had been head man since 1995. He
had been involved with the national team since 1990, and, in recent
years, had spent as many as 250 days on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Even before this summer's dramatic World Cup triumph, DiCicco
had said that family concerns _ his sons are 17, 14, 12, and 8 _
might keep him from pursuing an Olympic repeat next year. ``I came
home once and one of my sons said: When are you going to get
another job?'' DiCicco said last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Though his team had already qualified for Sydney by reaching the
Cup quarterfinals, DiCicco knew they would be either competing in
overseas tournaments or barnstorming the United States for
exhibitions from January until September. He had already won
everything there was to win in women's soccer. Was it worth the
personal price to go for a reprise? ``This was clearly a decision
from the heart and we respect that more than any other,'' said US
Soccer executive director Hank Steinbrecher, who has asked DiCicco
to serve as a consultant. ``He has said all along that spending
time with his real first team, his family, was critical to him
coming out of the women's World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrecher said that the federation will identify and
interview potential successors during the next few weeks. Among the
leading candidates are DiCicco's assistants, Lauren Gregg and Jay
Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a mother myself, I totally empathize with Tony wanting
to be at home with his family,'' said team captain Carla Overbeck.
``We will always cherish the successes we achieved and we will miss
him tremendously as a coach and friend.''

LATEST SHOOTINGS POINT OUT INCREASED RISKS OF WORKPLACE VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The day before a gunman opened fire in an office in
Seattle's Wallingford neighborhood, killing two employees and
wounding two others, a copier repairman killed seven coworkers in
Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily a coincidence, says Dr. Roland Maiuro, a
clinical psychologist and violence prevention specialist at
Seattle's Harborview Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Seattle gunman's motive is not known, a disturbed
individual `teetering'' on the edge of violence may be encouraged
by someone else committing a violent act, Maiuro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Observing someone else do it makes it possible for them to do
the unthinkable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of violence in the workplace is rising, and Seattle's
risk may be growing even faster in spite _ or perhaps because _ of
the region's celebrated economic boom, said Maiuro, a nationally
recognized expert on the roots of hostility and violence who runs
Harborview's anger management and domestic violence program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most rapidly growing form of violence in the
country today,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Workplace violence is reaching epidemic proportions because not
enough is being done to prevent it. An individual's identity and
sense of self-worth is increasingly tied to what happens at work,
he said, which makes the workplace a target when rage and despair
get out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is doing fine at work, he said, and someone leaning
toward violence can get pushed over the edge by a rude comment,
mistreatment by a superior or simply a resentful recognition of
economic disparity _ the rage of a have-not among the haves.
</P>
<P>
   Workplace slayings account for one out of every six deaths on
the job, according to the Justice Department, and more than two
million people every year suffer violence or threats of violence at
the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   While deaths get the most attention, the problem is better
understood if taken in the context of all acts and threats of
violence in the workplace, according to the Workplace Violence
Research Institute, a private company in Palm Springs, Calif., that
works with employers on violence prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute conducted a study in 1995 that estimated workplace
violence cost businesses more than $36 billion in one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The costs of harassment, threats and intimidation, which occur
every day, greatly exceed the dollar loss of those cases that
involve fatalities,'' the Institute reported. Violence in the
workplace was ``virtually unheard of until the 1970s,'' the report
noted.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Anne Dewing, assistant director of employment assistance
with the non-profit Family Services program, a Seattle social
service and counseling agency, said there are 425 incidents of
workplace violence reported every day.
</P>
<P>
   Although awareness of the problem is growing, it has not yet
translated into widespread action from employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to pay as much attention to the underlying causes as
we do to the act (of violence) itself,'' Dewing said. She agreed
with Maiuro that most employers have not given serious attention to
how to prevent workplace violence and how to intervene
constructively when potentially violent situations arise.
</P>
<P>
   Both Maiuro and Dewing offer inexpensive or free violence
prevention programs and information. Both said employer interest in
participating in such programs is increasing.
</P>
<P>
   Maiuro said part of the problem is the stigma associated with
being labeled a problem employee. Such programs need to include
everyone and not single out individuals for intervention unless
absolutely necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many at-risk individuals who need mental health
care can't get it because their health plan won't cover it, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   There are as many ways to explain what propels a person to
violent acts as there are descriptions of any individual's personal
struggle, Maiuro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very simply, violence occurs because people have issues they
fail to resolve,'' he said.

THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO NIKE: THE FINISH LINE IS NEAR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With what could best be described as evangelical
zeal, Nike is in the middle of an advertising campaign this week in
New York City that tries to capitalize on that proud urban
tradition of preaching from street corners to promote the company's
products during the 30th running of the New York City Marathon,
which will take place on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Prophets in flowing robes, others in sandwich boards warning of
``Judgement Day'' and choirs bursting into inspirational song are
among the techniques the company is putting in place to attract
attention to itself as the marathon approaches. The Judgment Day in
question refers not to the one the New Testament warns about but to
the marathon, which will, as always, wend its way through the five
boroughs with its attendant amateurs, world record-holders and
plethora of used paper cups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing off the idea that runners are fanatical about
their sport,'' said Robert Mitchell, a spokesman for the company.
``It's almost a religion for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The choirs in question will be wearing hats with the Nike logo
on the front, he added. The prophets will be distinguishable for
their Nike attire as well. The messages carried on the sandwich
boards will be accompanied by others on bus stops and other places
with messages like ``The End Is Near'' and ``Keep the Faith.'' The
campaign does not deliberately mention the marathon by name,
largely because Nike is not an official sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is thrilled, especially the organizers of the
marathon. ``Nike has done the predictable thing, which is to ambush
this event,'' said Scott Lange, executive vice president and chief
marketing officer for the New York Road Runners Club.
</P>
<P>
   Marathon officials negotiated with Nike for three months earlier
this year after the company's four-year sponsorship contract came
up for renewal, but the two sides were unable to reach an
agreement. The sponsorship rights went to Asics Tiger, which makes
Asics and Tiger running shoes and paid handsomely (in the $1
million range, by some estimates) for the privilege of being
associated with the marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not happy about it,'' Lange said of Nike's campaign.
``It's a very interesting challenge and predicament. We like to see
all runners benefit from what is good for runners, and the park is
open to the public. If Nike is out there handing something to the
runners, I can't say we have a legal pretext for removing Nike.''
</P>
<P>
   Lange added that his concerns were mainly about safety _ having
unplanned appearances by marketers along the race course could be
hazardous, he said _ and what he called ``unauthorized signage.''
To combat both, he has organized an ``anti-ambushing squad,'' and
he personally removed several hundred yards of unauthorized banners
put up by another shoe manufacturer in the park during the 1997
marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Mingey, another Nike spokesman, said the campaign was not
meant to subvert the marathon in any way. ``While we are certainly
sorry to hear that the New York Road Runners Club is upset, our
intention is simply to excite the city of New York and all who come
here to run in this event, which is arguably the greatest race in
the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is nonetheless seen by one marketer as a clever one
that takes Nike, lately criticized for losing sight of its mission,
as it were, back to its roots as a company that got started selling
running shoes out of the trunk of its founder's car.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got so big that they kind of forgot that their roots were
with the athletes,'' said Jonathan Ressler, the president of Big
Fat Promotions, a Manhattan-based unit of Omnicom Group that
specializes in grass-roots marketing plans and does not count Nike
among its clients. ``It was about `Just do it,' not `Hey, this is a
cool shoe to wear.' This is a total return to what they were
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambush marketing, also known as guerrilla marketing, has long
plagued the organizers of the marathon, Lange said. Given the
staging area _ the public streets and Central Park _ it would be
easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for
marathon organizers to keep unofficial marketers at bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just Nike,'' he said. He got his first taste of
``Judgement Day'' last Sunday as he was running in a 5-kilometer
race known as the Arthur Andersen Not Quite the New York City
Marathon. Marketers from Nike were pressing plastic bags full of
pamphlets and other material into runners' hands along the course,
he said, which he considered a safety risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to do it before the race, or after the race, on
public property,'' Lange said. ``But to do it during the race, it's
a hazard.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan Lester, the international promotions manager for Asics
Tiger, which is based in Fountain Valley, Calif., said she too was
approached. ``It took me a while to even recognize that it was
Nike,'' she said. ``The people I was with were avoiding them. We
thought it was a cult group.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ressler, the marketer, insisted that Nike's approach would be
effective in the long run. ``It's involving people with your
brand,'' he said. ``Traditional advertising is ineffective. When
something kind of breaks people's routines and makes them go `Wow,'
then they will remember it. That's a home run.''

MARTINEZ GETS MVP AWARD FROM ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Cy Young? Most Valuable Player? There is increasing
evidence that Red Sox star pitcher Pedro Martinez could win both of
awards in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez took a major step in that direction Wednesday when he
was named Major League Player of the Year by the Associated Press.
Martinez received 56 votes in nationwide balloting by sportswriters
and broadcasters in recognition of a dominating season that saw him
lead the majors in wins (23) and ERA (2.07).
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones of Atlanta, the likely National League MVP,
finished second with 14 votes, 2 more than Cleveland outfielder
Manny Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra received 1 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is only the second pitcher to win the award, which was
created in 1988. Atlanta's Greg Maddux won in 1995; although he was
won the Cy Young, Cincinnati shortstop Barry Larkin took MVP
honors.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, 28, is the first Boston player to win the award. He
was 23-4 with a 2.07 ERA in 31 starts, and struck out a
league-leading 313 batters in 213 1/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press award differs from the Cy Young and MVP
honors, which are awarded by the Baseball Writers' Association of
America. With rare exception, the MVP is an everyday player and not
a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Eckersley, then a reliever with Oakland, won both awards
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Before that Roger Clemens brought home two trophies to Boston in
1986; releiver Willie Hernandez of Detroit, 1984; reliever Rollie
Fingers of Milwaukee in 1981; starter Vida Blue of Oakland in 1971;
and starter Denny McLain of Detroit in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Even though teammate Garciaparra won the American League batting
title and is a solid MVP candidate in his own right, it is doubtful
the Red Sox could have made the playoffs for a second straight
season without Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who came in trade to Boston in November 1997, was the
anchor of a Red Sox that won the wild card and upset Cleveland in
the first round of the playoffs before losing to the New York
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Despite pulling a muscle in the wild-card series, Martinez
didn't allow a runner past first in his final 14 1/3 innings of the
playoffs, with hitters going 2 for 45 (.044) against him, with two
singles, five walks, and 22 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette is on his way to California
for the start of the general managers meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Before he left, he said in an interview on radio station WEEI
that the club definitely has an interest in Seattle outfielder Ken
Griffey Jr., but mostly will talk with other GMs to see what the
parameters of any kind of deal would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know he's a great player,'' said Duquette. ``And I'm sure
many teams would like to have him. But you're talking about losing
a front-line player and several prospects for a player who might be
with you only one year because of his contract. That's not likely
to happen. Also, he has a part of the country in mind where he'd
like to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a pretty solid nucleus built around Pedro and Nomar.
There may be deals out there, but we have some pretty good players
coming that will enable us to continue to build our ballclub.''

4 DEPUTIES NAMED TO WTO'S REGULATORY GROUP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Burkina Faso, France, Venezuela, New Zealand)   By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The World Trade Organization's director general, Mike
Moore, named four new deputies Wednesday, including the first
African to hold such a high-level post, to help him run the
134-nation trade regulatory group.
</P>
<P>
   Those selected were a former trade minister of Burkina Faso,
Ablasse Ouedraogo, plus Andrew L. Stoler of the United States,
Paul-Henri Ravier of France and Miguel Rodriguez Mendoza of
Venezuela. Stoler has been deputy chief of the U.S. trade mission
in Geneva since 1989; Ravier is a 20-year veteran of the French
trade department, and Mendoza was chief trade adviser at the
Organization of American States and his country's trade minister
from 1991 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, expected for some time, had been delayed by
the large number of candidates and by efforts to attain regional
balance, with at least one representative of the least-developed
countries in a leadership post.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Moore called the decision ``an extremely tough
call, given all the very good people who were nominated by their
governments.''
</P>
<P>
   The choices were complicated by Moore's unusual tenure as chief
and his split term. He is to be succeeded in three years' time by
Supachai Panitchpakdi, a Thai deputy prime minister, who had to be
consulted on the timing of the appointments. It was agreed that the
four deputies would serve for one month after Moore's incumbency
ends on Aug. 31, 2002, to allow for a smooth transition, according
to the announcement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The main difficulty Moore faced in making the choices was
satisfying the World Trade Organization's fractured constituencies,
whose ability to get along has been frayed by contentious
negotiations for the scheduled beginning on Nov. 30 of a new round
of international trade negotiations in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Resentment among developing countries has been expressed in
preparatory meetings, with many of these delegates insisting that
they have more of a say in running the trade forum. Moore, a former
New Zealand prime minister, has committed himself to integrating
those emerging economies, which make up the bulk of trade group's
members, more fully into the workings of the organization.

STATE AG IS LOOKING AT '94 TREASURY CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A former deputy state treasurer, accused in September
of masterminding a massive state Treasury theft, awarded a contract
for the management of $1 billion in government funds to Fidelity
Investments in 1994 after a highly unusual cancellation of an
earlier bid competition, according to sources and state records.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly's office
are examining the circumstances surrounding former deputy treasurer
Robert Foley's awarding of the multimillion dollar, multiyear
contract to Fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   Although the contract selection process specified that price
would be a prime consideration, Fidelity's original bid was the
highest among the 13 offers from money management companies
submitted in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Foley then threw out the bids and issued a new request for
proposals. In the next round, Fidelity significantly lowered its
bid and won the contract, now worth about $735,000 a month in fees,
according to the records.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies among the 13 competing for the contract also
lowered their bids in the second round, but Fidelity remained among
the highest. Sources said Foley personally directed the contract to
Fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Fidelity strongly denied any wrongdoing and said
the company obtained the contract because of its qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won this business on the merits, as one of the world's
leading financial services companies and we did nothing wrong in
winning this business,'' said Fidelity spokesman Vin Loporchio.
</P>
<P>
   Foley's attorney, John Bee, said Foley was not alone in
selecting Fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Foley was a member of the selection committee'' involved
in the process ``and the committee reported directly to (former
first deputy treasurer) Tom Trimarco and Joe Malone,'' Bee said.
``The results of the process and the decision as to who was
selected was not just Bob Foley's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone did not respond to a call requesting comment. But
Trimarco said the choice of Fidelity was appropriate, and not made
by Foley singlehandedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that process and I think that everything was done
appropriately,'' Trimarco said.
</P>
<P>
   Foley's behind-the-scenes revisions, however, raise questions
about the methods the Treasury used to award contract work under
former treasurer Joseph D. Malone, an area Reilly's investigators
are now focusing on.
</P>
<P>
   The question that intrigues investigators is why Foley threw out
the first round of bids.
</P>
<P>
   In September, a Suffolk County grand jury indicted Foley and two
other former Treasury workers, along with two Boston lawyers, one
of them a chief fund-raiser for Malone, and two other men for their
alleged roles in stealing nearly $10 million from the department.
</P>
<P>
   Foley has pleaded not guilty to the charges and is cooperating
with investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Foley led the internal Treasury committee that issued the
request for proposals on the contract, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, bids aren't pulled back,'' said a person familiar
with the Treasury's requests for proposals. ``There are some
circumstances in which you might. Sometimes you don't get any
bidders. But that's obviously not the case here.''
</P>
<P>
   Treasury documents show that Foley issued the first request for
proposals in February 1993 to select a firm to manage the
Massachusetts Municipal Depository Trust, a fund set up for local
government agencies to pool their surplus cash in one account to
earn a higher interest rate. That fund has swelled to $4.3 billion
since the contract was awarded, and Fidelity now earns $735,000 a
month in management fees.
</P>
<P>
   But Fidelity, which had managed the fund since its inception in
1977, initially made an offer more costly to the state than all the
other companies, records show. The documents show Fidelity bid the
work for 29 basis points, or a management fee equal to almost
one-third of 1 percent of the managed assets. The 12 other bids
ranged from 13.5 basis points to 25 basis points, all lower than
Fidelity's bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a lengthy and thoughtful deliberation of the responses
received, the committee elected to terminate the process,'' Foley
wrote in a memo to Malone. ``Based on the proposals received, the
committee believed that there was a lack of understanding among the
respondents concerning the scope and intent of the Trust Fund as an
investment pool.''
</P>
<P>
   In January 1994, Foley issued a new request for bids.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Fidelity, along with several other companies, reduced
its offer, but Fidelity's bid was still among the highest. Fidelity
cut its bid to 20 basis points _ a 30 percent cut from its previous
offer _ which was more in line with the dozen other competing bids
from firms that included Kemper Financial Services, Putnam
Investments, Goldman Sachs Asset Management, and Merrill Lynch
Asset Management.
</P>
<P>
   ``To demonstrate the importance of this relationship to Fidelity
and to prove our commitment . . . Fidelity proposes a single fee of
20 basis points,'' Fidelity wrote to the Treasury as the company
submitted its revised bid.
</P>
<P>
   The lowest bidder, Merrill Lynch Asset Management, offered to do
the work for 13.5 basis points.
</P>
<P>
   Written into the second request for proposals was a directive to
bidders to contact only Foley with any questions or concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interested firms should not contact any other employee,
selection committee member, or agent of the Commonwealth concerning
the subject matter of this request for qualifications or related
matters,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury spokesman Dwight Robson declined to comment on the
bidding process.
</P>
<P>
   However, Robson said Treasurer Shannon P. O'Brien will be
issuing a new bid on the fund sometime early next year. Although
the 1994 contract was good for four years, Malone extended it for
another year while he was running for governor last year. And
Robson said the treasurer does not want to make any major changes
with contracts or services around the new year because of Y2K
computer concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Although Fidelity has repeatedly exceeded the benchmark for the
growth of the fund, Robson said the state should be able to
leverage lower management fees.

7 FIRMS IN $1 BILLION SETTLEMENT OF SUIT ON VITAMIN PRICE-FIXING 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seven of the world's largest drug and pharmaceutical companies
agreed Wednesday to pay more than $1.1 billion to settle a
class-action lawsuit that sought damages as a result of an
international conspiracy to fix vitamin prices.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, which was submitted to a federal judge in
Washington for approval, is thought to be the largest civil
settlement ever in a class-action antitrust case. It comes just
months after the companies agreed to pay record fines in settling a
criminal complaint from the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   The seven companies had been accused in both cases of plotting,
for nearly a decade, to artificially inflate the prices of the raw
vitamin blends that go into everything from milk and breakfast
cereal to animal feed. The blends involve vitamins A, C and E and a
variety of the B-complex vitamins, including beta-carotene.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action case was brought by direct purchasers of bulk
vitamins, including some of the world's largest food, beverage and
animal feed companies, like Kellogg, Kraft and Tyson Foods.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement payments are expected to compensate those
purchasers, rather than ordinary consumers.
</P>
<P>
   As indirect purchasers of raw vitamin mixtures, consumers have
been overpaying for everything from vitamin tablets to the small
portions of vitamins added into everyday foods. But although
lawyers involved in the case say consumers may be compensated as
part of state class-action suits pending against the vitamin
makers, few think any such settlements would be as large as the
private settlement that was announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The vitamin makers, several of which have already settled
government charges in Canada, are also facing antitrust
investigations in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the conspiracy, which lasted from 1990 to 1998,
the seven companies had already agreed to pay nearly $2 billion in
government and class-action settlements for fixing the prices of
vitamins in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The companies that settled Wednesday are Roche of Switzerland,
BASF of Germany, Rhone-Poulenc of France, Hoechst Marion Roussel of
Germany, Takeda Chemical of Japan, Eisai Co. of Japan and Daiichi
Pharmaceutical of Japan. The settlement figure represents a penalty
of about 20 cents on every dollar in sales by the seven companies
during the period in question, lawyers involved in the case said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Most of the companies have previously said that they regretted
their involvement in the conspiracy and would like to put it behind
them. But Wednesday, most of the public statements simply
acknowledged the facts of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a substantial step for us in resolving the pending
lawsuits,'' a spokesman at BASF said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers involved in the class-action case, however, hailed it as
a milestone, one that helped break up an international cartel that
controlled 90 percent of the U.S. vitamin market and more than 70
percent of the global market and reached virtually every household
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case has helped stop a conspiracy that was organized in
Europe and implemented in the U.S., that fixed prices and carved up
our markets for about a decade,'' said Jonathan Schiller, a lawyer
at Boies &AMP; Schiller, one of the firms involved in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action lawyers are still pursuing suits against a
smaller group of vitamin producers that deal in niacin and choline
chloride.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The case goes back to the mid-1990s, when Justice Department
investigators and private antitrust lawyers began pursuing
accusations that the big vitamin makers were meeting regularly in
hotels around the world to fix prices and eliminate competition,
according to lawyers involved in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The case broke open this year after Rhone-Poulenc stepped
forward as part of the plea agreement with the Justice Department.
Roche and BASF then acknowledged taking part in a much broader
conspiracy that executives sometimes brazenly dubbed Vitamins Inc.,
according to the government.
</P>
<P>
   Roche and BASF agreed last May to pay more than $700 million to
settle criminal price-fixing charges.
</P>
<P>
   Private lawyers at big antitrust law firms like Boies &AMP; Schiller
in New York and Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld &AMP; Toll in Washington led
an aggressive private campaign against the vitamin makers, filing
suit as early as 1997.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case the private enforcement contributed in critical
ways to breaking the case and showed how effectively it could
complement a Justice Department investigation,'' said Robert
Silver, a lawyer at Boies &AMP; Schiller.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After the settlement is approved, notices will go out to
companies represented by the class action. They will then have the
chance to opt out of the settlement to pursue their own cases.
</P>
<P>
   According to the agreement, direct purchasers of raw vitamins
will get $1.05 billion. A separate fee for the lawyers, covering
about 50 firms, will amount to $122.4 million, bringing the total
settlement to $1.17 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Adams, a lawyer who represents Tyson Foods and other
large purchasers of raw vitamins, said his clients were considering
opting out of the case because they consider the settlement amount
far too small.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe this is anywhere close to what the large
purchasers of vitamins expect to recover,'' Adams said.

<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ In Kentucky, Burrito found the wire and paid
33-1 wearing it. In California, racing stewards would not let Zante
out of the paddock sporting one. Rip! Off came the latest piece of
equipment for race horses, and Zante's trainer, Bobby Frankel, is
still upset. He knows what his horse's nose needs: a nasal strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the big deal?'' said Frankel, the colorful Brooklyn,
N.Y.-born Hall of Fame trainer. ``They allow everything else. How
is a Band-Aid going to hurt them? It shows the mentality in our
game. It's antiquated.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Kentucky, Florida allows the 4-by-6-inch adhesive patch
that is similar to, but larger than, the Breathe Right strips that
are seen on everyone from professional football players to weekend
joggers to snorers. Now add some of the most expensive race horses
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Surfside, High Yield, Cat Thief _ in fact, all seven of the
horses D. Wayne Lukas will saddle on Saturday in the Breeders' Cup
races will be wearing the nasal strip for the first time. ``They
won't know the difference,'' said Lukas, another Hall of Fame
trainer. ``It can't hurt them.''
</P>
<P>
   With 102 of the finest race horses from around the globe
gathered here at Gulfstream Park to shoot it out for $13 million in
purses, the question of to breathe or not to breathe (with help)
has been debated amusingly, philosophically and aesthetically every
morning at the barns.
</P>
<P>
   Made by the same company as its human forerunner, the strip is
supposed to do the same thing for horses that it does for humans _
ease breathing by decreasing upper-airway nasal resistance. Lukas
and Frankel are the only trainers committed to trying it in
Saturday's Grade I races. Or are they?
</P>
<P>
   Most of their fellow trainers have the strips in their barns and
are eager to show them off. Many have experimented with them during
workouts. But, in a milieu where caginess, a poker face and the
never-ending quest for an edge is the premium, most are reluctant
to give their opponents an idea that might add a few more steps to
their horse.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame trainer Scotty Schulhofer says that he would
not mess with the preparation of the Belmont and Travers winner
Lemon Drop Kid by adding the strip for the $4 million Classic, in
which his colt is listed at odds of 8-1. But he has conducted a
study _ on himself _ that he says warrants testing the device on
some of his horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a cold the other night that woke me up,'' Schulhofer
said, eyes twinkling. ``I put one of those human kinds on and slept
like a baby. If it will help a horse get more oxygen, I'm for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the more skeptical trainers profess to being invigorated by
the introduction of something new in a sport where change has come
glacially since its beginnings in the 17th century. The
Kentucky-based trainer Phil Hauswald, for instance, has a hard time
believing that the strip will improve air flow and mean a faster
horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``But over the course of history a lot of people have laughed at
a lot of things that have come true,'' said Hauswald, who will race
Middlesex Drive in the Mile. ``Sometimes we're steeped too much in
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there are the aesthetes. Bob Baffert grimaces at the
thought of one of his eight horses in the Breeders' Cup edging into
the winner's circle with a black patch on his or her schnoz. ``I'm
into the cosmetics. I don't think it would look good in the win
photo unless you had your name, or maybe phone number, on it,''
said Baffert, a joke that belied the fact he worked one of his best
championship shots _ Forestry 4-1 in the Sprint _ with the strip
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it works or not, the nasal strip is a new solution for
an old problem _ getting a horse to breathe efficiently. Horses
breathe through the nose, and there are approved pieces of
equipment to help them. A figure eight, for example, is a leather
strap that forces the mouth closed.
</P>
<P>
   Two veterinarians _ Jim Chiapetta and Ed Blach _ designed what
is now called the Flair Equine Nasal Strip. It was tested on seven
geldings at Kansas State University in a study conducted by a
veterinarian, H.H. Erickson. The study found that the strips
improved oxygen intake and also reduced exercise-induced pulmonary
hemorrhage _ or bleeding in the lungs _ a condition that plagues
many race horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a 5 percent reduction in the amount of work animals
had to do at their highest speeds.'' said Dan Cohen, chairman and
chief executive officer of CNS Inc., the Minneapolis company that
manufactures Breathe Right and the equine nasal strip. ``They
consumed 5 percent less oxygen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't create as much vacuum, you won't suck out as much
blood, and that is better for the horse in the long term,'' Cohen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's company has been providing free samples to trainers.
When Burrito won at Keeneland on Oct. 23, followed by a victory by
another first-time starter wearing the strip, the Kentucky Racing
Commission added a new line of information to the daily track
program _ which horses were wearing nasal strips.
</P>
<P>
   In California and New York, racing officials have been cautious
and want further review before allowing the nasal strips. Terry
Meyocks, president of the New York Racing Association, raised
concerns about how well the adhesive strip would stick in various
weather conditions, as well as the possible negative effects of
horses inhaling more dirt deeper into their systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do they know?'' said a defiant Frankel who, despite being
a leading trainer on the West Coast, has never won a Breeders' Cup
race in 30 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   So don't be surprised if million-dollar horses _ Frankel's or
Lukas' _ show up in the winner's circle Saturday with a $10 piece
of equipment sitting above their nostrils. Just as a nose is a nose
is a nose, an edge is an edge is an edge.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   American Home Products Corp. and Warner-Lambert Co. are expected
on Thursday to announce a merger that would form the world's
largest drug company, people close to the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, valued at about $70 billion, would combine some of the
world's best known brands, including Warner-Lambert's Listerine
mouthwash and American Home Products' Advil painkiller, and two New
Jersey-based companies based less than 10 miles of each other.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, to be known as AmericanWarner, will be based in
Madison, N.J., the headquarters of American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
   The boards of both companies were meeting last night and were
expected to approve the deal. As in any merger negotiations, until
the boards approve the deal a transaction could fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   If a deal is consummated, the company would be a combination of
equals. Investors in both companies will trade in their stock for
shares in AmericanWarner, which will be divided evenly between
American Home and Warner-Lambert. The companies will each get 10
members on AmericanWarner's 20-member board, according to people
close to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   AHP had announced two huge mergers last year _ first with the
British drug maker SmithKline Beecham PLC and later with Monsanto
Co. _ that subsequently fell apart, primarily over who would run
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at AHP and Warner-Lambert have been talking about a
combination for several months, said one person close to the
companies. It is believed that AHP had approached Warner-Lambert as
early as last year, but the company was not eager to merge until
Warner-Lambert chairman Lodewijk . de Vink took over in January.
</P>
<P>
   Executive egos are unlikely to derail this deal, however. People
close to the negotiations said Wednesday that John Stafford, the
62-year-old chairman and chief executive of American Home Products,
will become chairman of AmericanWarner, but only for 18 months. He
will then be succeeded by de Vink, who will serve as the chief
executive of AmericanWarner. He is 54 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Stafford has strong opinions as to how the executive office
should be structured. One person close to the talks said that
Stafford had insisted that AmericanWarner have no mandatory
retirement age for its chairman or chief executive, a policy that
is in place now at American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
   An AHP spokesman declined to comment on the management
structure.
</P>
<P>
   The birth of AmericanWarner might be the beginning of the next
set of large mergers in the drug industry. The company, which will
have $23.7 billion in total sales, will have an enormous presence
in consumer brands and agricultural products as well as
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Wednesday that they still expect AHP ome to
continue its plan to sell its troubled agricultural division,
allowing the new company to concentrate on its core prescription
drug business.
</P>
<P>
   With $13.8 billion in worldwide prescription sales,
AmericanWarner would be the biggest concern in its industry. Its
nearest competitors _ Novartis, Astra/Zeneca and Merck _ each have
about $11 billion in worldwide sales in an industry so fragmented
that its leaders have single digit shares of the market, according
to IMS Health, an industry consultant.
</P>
<P>
   After the merger, AmericanWarner will have 5.5 percent of the
world prescription drug market, compared with Astra/Zene2
percent, IMS said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts insist that AmericanWarner's size will be an advantage.
The combined company's research and development expenses last year
totaled $2.5 billion, compared with just $877 million at
Warner-Lambert. By comparison, Merck spent $1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unlikely that there will be any significant antitrust
issues with the merger,'' said Viren Mehta, a partner at Mehta
Partners. ``There is very little obvious overlap in the products
the two companies make. The only noticeable problem is the sizable
gap that would exist between the world's top drug maker and its
nearest competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Wednesday that they were surprised at how quickly
American Home Products has moved to correct its ill fortunes. Aside
from AHP's two ill-fated mergers, the company had several product
calamities, including a $54 million settlement over its Norplant
contraception device and a $3.75 billion payout to settle claims
over the fen-phen diet pill combination.
</P>
<P>
   The product disasters had caused shares of American Home
Products to tumble 45 percent from its 52-week high of $70.25 on

   Analysts said Wednesday that AHP executives feared that the
company could become prey to hostile competitors, notably Novartis,
which has a sizable agricultural and consumer division, or
Glaxo-Wellcome, a company analysts believe to be actively looking
for a deal.

   Investors reacted giddily to the possibility of an all-American
merger. Shares of American Home Products jumped 11 percent, or
$5.625 Wednesday, to $56. Warner-Lambert's stock jumped $5.625, to
$83.8125.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts believe the merger, which was reported Wednesday
in The Wall Street Journal, is necessary. In the last few years,
the pharmaceutical industry has become so competitive that
companies can ill afford to not have blockbuster drugs on pharmacy
shelves or be boasting about others in their pipelines.

<P>
   Even though Warner-Lambert had been one of the drug industry's
hottest performers _ routinely reporting quarterly earnings gains
of more than 30 percent _ analysts were concerned that its pipeline
lacked the depth of some of its competitors.

 UNDATED: its competitors.

   AmericanWarner will have a strong presence in several drug
categories. Sales of Lipitor, Warner-Lambert's cholesterol
reduction drug, should near $5 billion next year, according to
analysts, while American Home Products' Effexor antidepressant line
and Premarin hormone replacement are projected to each top $1
billion in sales in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, we like the deal between American Home Products and
Warner-Lambert,'' said Neil Sweig, an analyst with Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co.
``But it's not a done deal by any means. But it has some positives.
Warner-Lambert is not so dependent on Lipitor and American Home has
a good drug pipeline.''
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have potential top selling drugs under
development. AHP is developing two vaccines _ one for flu and one
for pediatric pneumonia _ that analysts project to notch sales of
more than $250 million. Warner-Lambert is developing a treatment
for neuropathic pain that could sell more than $600 million. All
three drugs are expected to be released within the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a bounty of new products, the merger is expected to
create $1 billion in synergies, according to people close to the
negotiations. One target may be the two companies' home operations,
which employ some 6,700 people in New Jersey alone. Analysts could
not project how many jobs could be eliminated, although some
duplication could result in virtually all of the new company's
prime businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Even though some analysts were cautious that the deal could be
scrapped, others believed it would succeed by how well the two
companies' chief executives appeared to be getting along. Stafford
has a reputation for being one of the industry's most aggressive
bosses, to the point of throwing the occasional elbow on the
company basketball court, according to one of his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   But de Vink, while confident, does not need to be in the
limelight, analysts said, making him the perfect executive office
companion to Stafford.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be hard for an outside company to break this
deal up,'' Mehta said. ``Few management teams fit as neatly
together as this one.''  &QL;

 By PETER HUDSON 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ When Carlos Menem took over the
presidency in Argentina in 1989, the nation was completing a decade
of triple-digit inflation and negative GDP growth. The large
swathes of the economy that were in state hands were in crisis. It
was almost impossible to buy a new phone line, electricity was
expensive, and power cuts frequent. YPF, the oil and gas giant, had
won a less than flattering place in the Guinness Book of World
Records in 1983, when it was still state-owned, for the
largest-ever loss recorded by a company in a single year _ $4.6
billion.
 &HT;    Today, nearly all of these assets have been sold, in most cases
producing marked increases in performance. The Menem years produced
total growth of around 35 percent, while inflation in recent years
has dropped below that of the United States.
 &HT;    But economic growth has done little to promote social justice
and, following a first term dedicated to stabilizing the economy,
Menem has failed to deliver improvements in employment and welfare.
That's bad luck _ at least in part. The second term started with
the 1994 Mexican maxi-devaluation, known as the Tequila crisis,
which was followed by meltdown in Russia (the ``Vodka effect''),
economic collapse in South East Asia (Asian flu) and devaluation in
neighboring Brazil (the Samba effect).
 &HT;    Nevertheless, with or without growth, the gap between rich and
poor has grown every year throughout the Menem years. Official
statistics show that a fifth of national households, with an
average of five members each, survive on just $12 a day.
 &HT;    Domingo Cavallo, the renowned former economy minister who is in
the running for the presidency, says Menem squandered opportunities
and retreated from the administration's original principles.
``Economic change doubled the resources available in real terms to
the provinces and the federal government. There was every
opportunity to develop a tremendous social policy.'' Instead, says
Cavallo, Menem ``subordinated everything to his attempts to
perpetuate himself in power.''
 &HT;    The transition to a new Argentine leader is expected to be
smooth. But the winner will have to whip into shape a government
that spends far too much money. He will be called upon to fix a
terrible tax system, diversify an economy too dependent on its
Brazilian neighbor and bring order to a nation of politicians who
rank as among the world's most corrupt.
 &HT;    All bets are on Argentina's opposition Alliance candidate
Fernando de la Rua easily defeating Peronist rival Eduardo Duhalde
and Cavallo, who leads the Accion por la Republica party. A poll
released in early August indicated that De la Rua had an
overwhelming lead over Duhalde with 47 percent to 31 percent.
Cavallo garnered only 7 percent of support from those polled by the
Centro de Estudios Union para la Nueva Mayoria. Another poll
conducted by Gallup had De la Rua with a 43 percent31 percent edge
over Duhalde. Elections are slated for October 24.
 &HT;    Despite threats by candidate Duhalde about a debt moratorium,
economic policy isn't expected to change. Still, many foreigners
fret that the new government could abandon the centerpiece of
Menem's economic reforms: the convertibility plan and currency
board system that maintains a rigid one-to-one relationship between
the peso and the dollar.
 &HT;    There is little cause for alarm. Argentina has the strength to
defend its regime, with nearly $27 billion in reserves, enough to
cover all pesos in circulation. Meanwhile, the banking system has
been reinforced with an emergency reserve of around $7 billion and
credit lines with international banks for another $8 billion.
 &HT;    More importantly, Argentines have the political will to do
whatever it takes to avoid a return to the days of hyperinflation.
For most, that time that characterized the last change of
government is such a painful memory that risking its return by
abandoning convertibility is a horrifying prospect. During the
Tequila crisis, for instance, polls consistently showed wide public
majorities in favor of lowering salaries rather than returning to
inflation. ``Convertibility is strongly defended by the people,''
says Cavallo, the plan's architect.
 &HT;    Abandoning convertibility would also do little to alleviate the
current recession. Unlike Brazil, Argentina is highly dollarized,
meaning that, as well as sparking a major bout of inflation,
devaluation would do little to help reduce exporters' costs and
would hurt those, including the government and wide sectors of the
public, who have dollar debts.
 &HT;    Menem's answer is to abandon the peso in favor of complete
dollarization. Given his current political weakness, however, he is
unlikely to be able to push the initiative through, particularly
because of opposition by U.S. officials, including recently
appointed U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. In any case,
dollarization would do nothing to improve economic competitiveness,
the major task facing the incoming government.
 &HT;    Clearly, Argentina's biggest problem has been Brazil, the only
major market with which it operates a trade surplus. The
devaluation of the real earlier this year wreaked havoc on the
Argentine economy (Brazil's currency has so far devalued by around
20 percent). With exports remaining sluggish, says local economist
Luis Secco, Argentina's current account deficit will drop only a
fraction this year from 4.8 percent to 4.4 percent.
 &HT;    Since the quick fix of devaluation has been ruled out, a
reduction in local costs will thus require tackling the structural
changes that Menem has left undone during his second term. One of
these would be revamping the tax system. The government currently
takes in about $50 billion, representing around 24 percent of GDP,
while even Brazil manages 30 percent. That burden falls
particularly hard on companies that operate in the formal economy.
The loss in revenues from tax evasion runs as high as $25 billion.
 &HT;    Employers complain particularly of taxes on employment and an
inflexible labor market in reducing their competitiveness. But
Guillermo Rozenwurcel, an economist at the opposition-backed
Argentine Foundation for Equitable Development, FADE, says prices
charged by the underregulated utility companies are ``at least as
important'' in reducing competitiveness. He cites telephone rates
and highway tolls. He says telephone charges run between 15 percent
and 30 percent higher than international norms; highway tolls as
much as 50 percent higher per kilometer.
 &HT;    Another troubling note is the Argentine government's nasty
spending habits. Despite the country's low inflation rate, public
spending rose from $66 billion in 1992 to $93 billion in 1999,
according to the Foundation for Latin American Economic Research.
And, despite raising $40 billion from privatization, the public
debt has more than doubled during the decade, from $61 billion to
$139 billion, while the resulting financial costs have leapt from
$4 billion to $10 billion a year. Its debt-to-GDP ratio is
projected to hit 40 percent this year compared with 35 percent in
1997.
 &HT;    Argentina's money problems were enough of a concern to Duff &AMP;
Phelps to prompt the international credit rating agency to lower
its sovereign debt rating for Argentina from positive to stable in
August. ``The positive outlook assigned in October 1997 was
contingent on the government taking decisive action in the areas of
tax and labor market reform and in a gradual but firm improvement
in fiscal and debt indicators,'' says Jaime Sanz, head of the
firm's Latin sovereign ratings. ``The results are not very
encouraging on either front and we don't see much scope for
improvement in the next six to 12 months.''
 &HT;    The government's spending spree has done little, however, to
reverse the notorious decline of the public-education and-health
systems. Institutional reform will also require a major clamp down
on state graft. The public lists the issue as its second or third
major concern, but also appears skeptical about the ability of the
two leading presidential candidates _ de la Rua and Duhalde _ to
tackle it.
 &HT;    Little surprise then that, in last year's ranking of perceptions
of corruption organized by Transparency International, the leading
non-government organization focusing on the issue, Argentina scored
an average of only 3.0 out of a possible 10 for maximum honesty. It
was rated 25th most corrupt out of the 85 countries surveyed.
 &HT;    Luis Moreno Ocampo, regional president of Transparency
International, a leading anticorruption crusader, remains
optimistic. ``If you had said that Menem was capable of
implementing a macroeconomic reform, people would have laughed,''
he says. ``Politicians are interested in power. They are all aware
of the fact that whoever manages to control corruption will gain a
lot of power.''
 &HT;    For Menem, the task has proven impossible because a president
can only effectively tackle corruption during the first two years
of office, Moreno Ocampo says. ``After [two years, the corruption
is his, not someone else's.''
 &HT;    With crime apparently intractable and little room for maneuver
on the economy, the opposition may find that locking up members of
the former government is the one thing it can do to win popular
support. Already during the launch of his election platform in last
May, presidential candidate Fernando de la Rua promised if elected
he would see that ``those guilty of corruption will form a
procession through the courts.''
 &HT;    Several ministers have already started the parade, most recently
an ex-minister for his role in illegal arms shipments to Croatia
and Ecuador. If allowed to run its course, that case could reach as
high as the president, who is among those who signed decrees
authorizing the shipments. Most political analysts believe that any
purge will remain at the level of Menem's ministers, with the worst
circumstance to await Menem being unemployment. Then again, there
is always the presidential election in 2005, when Menem will be
eligible to run again.

 Por PETER HUDSON 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ Cuando Carlos Menem ocupo la
presidencia de Argentina en 1989, la nacion llegaba al fin de una
decada de inflacion superior al 100 por ciento y una fuerte baja
del PIB. Los grandes sectores economicos en manos estatales estaban
en crisis. Era casi imposible instalar un nuevo telefono, la
electricidad era costosa y los apagones eran frecuentes. YPF, el
coloso petrolero, tuvo el dudoso honor de figurar en el Libro
Guinness de Records en 1983, cuando todavia era propiedad estatal,
por la mayor perdida sufrida por una empresa en un solo ano:
US$4.600 millones.
 &HT;    Hoy, casi todos esos activos se han vendido, y en casi todos ha
mejorado notablemente el rendimiento. Los anos de Menem produjeron
un crecimiento de casi el 35 por ciento, mientras la inflacion en
los ultimos anos es menor que en Estados Unidos.
 &HT;    Pero el crecimiento economico ha hecho poco por fomentar la
justicia social y, tras un primer termino dedicado a estabilizar la
economia, Menem no ha cumplido las promesas de mejorar la situacion
del empleo y el bienestar social. Es un problema _ en parte _ de
mala suerte. El segundo periodo comenzo con la devaluacion del peso
mexicano en 1994, seguida por la crisis de Rusia, el derrumbe
economico del Sudeste Asiatico y la devaluacion en Brasil.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, con crecimiento o sin crecimiento, el abismo entre
ricos y pobres ha crecido cada ano en el periodo de Menem. Las
estadisticas oficiales muestran que la quinta parte de los nucleos
familiares, con un promedio de cinco miembros cada uno, sobrevivio
solo con US$12 diarios.
 &HT;    Domingo Cavallo, el celebre ex ministro de Economia que se ha
postulado a la presidencia, dice que Menem malgasto oportunidades y
se alejo de los principios originales de su gobierno. ``El cambio
economico duplico los recursos para las provincias y el gobierno
federal. Estaban presentes todas las oportunidades para desarrollar
una formidable politica social''. En vez de hacer eso, dice
Cavallo, Menem ``lo subordino todo a su intento de perpetuarse en
el poder''.
 &HT;    Se espera que la transicion a un nuevo gobierno ocurra sin
contratiempos. Pero el ganador tendra que meter en cintura a un
Estado derrochador, tendra que reparar un desastroso sistema
fiscal, diversificar una economia demasiado dependiente de Brasil e
imponer orden en una de las clases politicas mas corruptas del
planeta.
 &HT;    Todo el mundo apuesta a que el candidato de la alianza
opositora, Fernando de la Rua, derrotara comodamente al peronista
Eduardo Duhalde y a Cavallo, que encabeza el partido Accion por la
Republica. Una encuesta divulgada a principios de agosto indico que
De la Rua le llevaba una ventaja abrumadora a Duhalde: el 47 por
ciento frente al 31 por ciento. Cavallo solo recibio el 7 por
ciento de apoyo entre los encuestados por el Centro de Estudios
Union para la Nueva Mayoria. Otro sondeo, realizado por Gallup para
el periodico La Nacion, le dio a De la Rua una ventaja de 43 por
ciento contra 31 por ciento sobre Duhalde. Las elecciones se
celebraran el 24 de octubre.
 &HT;    A pesar de las amenazas de Duhalde de imponer una moratoria a la
deuda, no se esperan cambios en la politica economica. No obstante,
muchos extranjeros temen que el nuevo gobierno abandone el nucleo
de las reformas economicas de Menem: el plan de convertibilidad y
la rigida paridad entre el peso y el dolar.
 &HT;    Hay pocas causas de alarma. Argentina tiene la fortaleza
necesaria para defender su regimen, con casi US$27.000 millones en
reservas, suficiente para respaldar todos los pesos en circulacion.
Entretanto, el sistema bancario se ha reforzado con una reserva de
emergencia de unos US$7.000 millones y lineas de credito con bancos
internacionales por US$8.000 millones.
 &HT;    Lo que es mas importante, los argentinos tienen la voluntad
politica de hacer lo que sea necesario para evitar un regreso a la
hiperinflacion. Durante la crisis mexicana, por ejemplo, las
encuestas mostraron que la gran mayoria preferia que bajaran los
salarios a que subiera la inflacion. ``El pueblo defiende
energicamente la convertibilidad'', dice Cavallo, el arquitecto del
plan.
 &HT;    Descartar la convertibilidad tampoco haria gran cosa por aliviar
la recesion. A diferencia de Brasil, Argentina esta muy dolarizada,
lo que significa que la devaluacion no solo provocaria un alza de
la inflacion, sino que no reduciria notablemente los costos de los
exportadores y afectaria a los que tienen deudas en dolares.
 &HT;    La respuest de Menem es abandonar el peso a favor de una
dolarizacion total. Pero debido a su actual debilidad politica, es
dificil que pueda adelantar la iniciativa, sobre todo debido a la
oposicion de Estados Unidos. En todo caso, la dolarizacion no
mejoraria la competitividad economica, que es la tarea mayor que
encara el proximo gobierno.
 &HT;    Evidentemente, el mayor problema de Argentina es Brasil, el
unico gran mercado con el que tiene un superavit comercial. La
devaluacion del real a principios de este ano devasto la economia
argentina (hasta ahora la moneda brasilena se ha devaluado en un 20
por ciento). Como las exportaciones se mantienen debiles, dice el
economista argentino Luis Secco, el deficit de cuenta corriente de
Argentina solo bajara este ano del 4,8 por ciento al 4,4 por
ciento.
 &HT;    Nadie cree que el problema de la devaluacion se solucione a
corto plazo, por lo que reducir los costos locales exige acometer
los cambios estructurales que Menem dejo incompletos, como la
reforma fiscal. El gobierno recauda unos US$50.000 millones,
alrededor del 24 por ciento del PIB, mientras el de Brasil absorbe
el 30 por ciento. Esa carga la sienten sobre todo las companias que
operan en la economia formal. La perdida de ingresos por evasion
fiscal es de US$25.000 millones.
 &HT;    Las empresas se quejan especialmente de los impuestos sobre el
empleo y de un inflexible mercado laboral que reduce su capacidad
de competencia. Pero Guillermo Rozenwurcel, economista de la
Fundacion Argentina de Desarrollo Equitativo (FADE), respaldada por
la oposicion, dice que los altos precios que cobran las companias
de servicios publicos tienen un efecto ``por lo menos igual de
importante'' en la reduccion de la competitividad. Menciona las
tarifas telefonicas y los peajes de las carreteras: el servicio
telefonico cuesta entre 15 por ciento y 30 por ciento mas que las
normas internacionales, y el peaje de las autopistas puede llegar a
ser 50 por ciento mas elevado por kilometro.
 &HT;    Otro punto conflictivo es el derroche del gobierno. A pesar de
la baja inflacion, el gasto publico crecio de US$66.000 millones en
1992 a US$93.000 millones en 1999, segun la Fundacion de
Investigacion Economica Latinoamericana. Y a pesar de recaudar
US$40.000 millones con la privatizacion, la deuda publica ha
aumentado en mas del doble durante la decada, de US$61.000 millones
a US$139.000 millones, mientras el costo financiero ha saltado de
US$4.000 millones a US$10.000 millones al ano. Se calcula que la
relacion deuda-PIB llegara al 40 por ciento este ano; en 1997 fue
del 35 por ciento.
 &HT;    Preocupada por los problemas monetarios de Argentina, Duff &AMP;
Phelps redujo en agosto la clasificacion de la deuda soberana
argentina de positiva a estable. ``Las perspectivas positivas
asignadas en octubre de 1997 dependian de que el gobierno diera
pasos positivos en la reforma fiscal y del mercado laboral, y en un
mejoramiento gradual pero firme de los indicadores tributarios y de
la deuda'', dice Jaime Sanz, director de calificacion de deuda
soberana en America Latina de la firma. ``Los resultados no son muy
alentadores en ninguno de esos frentes, y no vemos grandes
posibilidades de mejoria en los proximos seis a 12 meses''.
 &HT;    Pero los grandes gastos del gobierno no han hecho gran cosa por
detener la declinacion de los sistemas de educacion y salud. La
reforma institucional tambien requerira poner alto a la corrupcion
estatal. El publico senala constantemente ese problema como su
segunda o su tercera inquietud, pero tambien muestra escepticismo
sobre la capacidad de los dos principales candidatos a la
presidencia, De la Rua y Duhalde, de atajar la corrupcion.
 &HT;    Por lo tanto, no es extrano que en la clasificacion de
percepciones sobre la corrupcion en 1998, organizada por
Transparencia Internacional, Argentina tuviera un promedio de solo
3,0 de 10 (10 es la maxima honradez). Entre los 85 paises mas
corruptos, ocupo el lugar 25.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, Luis Moreno Ocampo, presidente regional de
Transparencia Internacional, no pierde el optimismo. ``Si uno
hubiera dicho que Menem era capaz de implementar una reforma
macroeconomica, la gente se habria reido'', comenta. ``Los
politicos estan interesados en el poder. Saben muy bien que el que
controle la corrupcion adquirira mucho poder''.
 &HT;    Para Menem, la tarea se ha hecho imposible porque un presidente
solo puede atajar la corrupcion en sus dos primeros anos en el
cargo, afirma Moreno Ocampo. ``Despues [de los dos anos, el
corrupto es el, no otro''.
 &HT;    Con el delito al parecer insoluble y poco espacio para maniobrar
en el terreno economico, es posible que la oposicion descubra que
poner tras las rejas a miembros del gobierno anterior le ganaria el
apoyo popular. En el lanzamiento de su plataforma electoral en
mayo, el candidato De la Rua prometio que si salia electo, se
ocuparia de que ``los culpables de corrupcion desfilen por los
tribunales''.
 &HT;    Varios ministros ya andan en esa procesion, entre ellos un ex
ministro por su papel en los envios ilegales de armas a Croacia y
Ecuador. Si se deja que ese caso siga su curso, podria llegar hasta
el mismo presidente, que esta entre los que firmaron decretos
autorizando los envios. La mayoria de los analistas politicos
piensa que cualquier purga solo llegaria al nivel de los ministros
de Menem, y que lo peor que podria pasarle a Menem seria el
desempleo. Pero de todas formas, siempre quedan las elecciones
presidenciales del 2005, y en esas elecciones Menem podria aspirar
de nuevo.

SHOOTING VICTIMS WERE PART OF `LITTLE FAMILY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HEATH FOSTER and RUTH TIECHROEB  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Peter John Giles didn't have any doubts about what he
wanted to do with his life when he graduated from college about
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The handsome, green-eyed young man loved being near the water
and had spent most summers in Alaska working on fishing boats his
grandfather and uncles owned. At 22, Giles left his parents behind
in Libertyville, Ill., and went to work for his two uncles in their
shipyard business on the northside of Lake Union. He told his
family the shipyard was his future.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, that future was stolen when a gunman killed Giles and
coworker Russ Brisendine and wounded two others.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy just barged into the office and killed my grandson
and wounded three others,'' said his shaken 82-year-old
grandfather, Richard Kelly. ``It's just a terrible thing. Who would
expect decent law-abiding citizens to get just shot down in cold
blood?''
</P>
<P>
   Giles came to Seattle to be Northlake Shipyard's book-keeper and
general manager, his grandfather said. His easy smile and upbeat,
energetic personality soon made him a favorite around the shipyard.
Kelly said his grandson's hard work also won him the trust of his
uncles, Richard Kelly, Jr. and Peter Kelly, owners of Northlake
Shipyard Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he really liked his uncles, and, of course, the fact
that he didn't have to put on a tie,'' his grandfather said.
</P>
<P>
   Giles' uncles, who are Richard Kelly's sons, relied on him so
much that they left the 27-year-old in charge of the shipyard this
week when they went away on vacation, Richard Kelly Jr. to Mexico,
and Peter Kelly to Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, he was the one left there to manage the
business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Giles died at the scene. Brisendine, a 43-year-old marine
engineer at the shipyard, died later at Harborview Medical Center
from multiple gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Brisendine left behind a wife, Naomi, who is Australian, and
four sons. Brisendine's neighbor of six years in Lynnwood, Wash.,
Cliff McMullen, said two of the boys are teenagers, and the other
two are younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Russ) enjoyed his family and camping with them,'' a shocked
McMullen said. ``He was just a good neighbor. If you needed a hand
or a cold beer, he was always around.''
</P>
<P>
   McMullen said the father of four went crazy decorating his house
every Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had kind of a competition going to see who could string up
the most lights,'' said McMullen.
</P>
<P>
   His work as a marine engineer sometimes took him offshore to
repair ships, McMullen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He enjoyed what he did,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shipwright Don Gomes said Brisendine and Giles, who was known as
``Little Pete,'' were well-respected and warm-hearted. He said
Brisendene was often generous in giving work to casual laborers and
was admired for his skills in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just great people to work for,'' he said. ``This is
like a little family. Everyone here are fishermen or ex-fishermen.
I can't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Kelly said when Giles was just 12-years-old, he spent
his first summer working on family-owned ``tender'' boats that
would pick up salmon from fishermen in Alaska and ferry them to
canneries. He guessed Giles had spent about 10 summers on Alaskan
waters and said that eventually Giles got his captain's license.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a lot of experience and he was a pretty capable boat
operator,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the family has sold all but one of its boats,
the 160-foot Ariga, a king crab fishing boat that has been leased
to a California company, Kelly said. His sons instead have focused
their energy into making the shipyard repair business a success,
and Giles was an important part of that effort.
</P>
<P>
   He was remembered well by those who worked at other businesses
in the Northlake Shipyard building. Jennifer Faller, president of
Surface Technology, described him as charmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a really upbeat, energetic, smiley, wonderful, old
peach of a guy,'' Faller said. ``He would do anything for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Giles' gradfather said the quality people noticed most about
Giles was his warmth.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a young kid, he was extremely gracious and polite,'' Kelly
said. ``Almost everyone how met him would tell me, `I would love to
have a grandson like that.' And when he got dressed up, he was real
handsome. The girls really like him, though none of them had nailed
him yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Giles had an apartment on the top of Queen Anne hill, not far
from his office. Lee Henrickson, the owner of Giles' condo unit,
described the young man as a good tenant who was quiet and timely
with his rent during the approximately three years he lived there.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Miami, Henrickson said Giles
``liked to be out on the water'' and had traveled to some islands
near the Phillipines in the last couple of years to snorkel.
Henrickson was dismayed that the young man was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a shocker,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Giles grandfather said that Giles' parents, George and Kathryn
Giles, will be flying in from Illinois today to help plans Giles'
funeral service. He said Giles also had an older brother, Craig,
and a younger sister, Monica.

SAFETY RECORD OF GENE THERAPY COMES UNDER INCREASED SCRUTINY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Pa., N.Y.)  (sw) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Six weeks after an 18-year-old Arizona man died
unexpectedly ne therapy experiment, the field's safety
record is coming under increasing scrutiny and new information is
coming to light about patients who may have been harmed in other
clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular concern to federal health officials are studies
that employ an inactivated cold virus, called adenovirus, as what
scientists call the vector that carries new genes to the proper
cells. The Arizona patient, Jesse Gelsinger died four days after
doctors at the University of Pennsylvania injected a corrective
gene, encased in a deactivated adenovirus, into the hepatic artery,
which leads to the liver.
</P>
<P>
   Leading scientists and government officials said Gelsinger was
the only person known to have died as a direct result of receiving
gene therapy. Other patients receiving gene therapy have died, but
doctors treating them in the trials say their diseases, not the
therapy, killed them.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a spokesman for Schering-Plough Corp., the drug
manufacturer, said that three liver cancer patients who had been
treated the same way as Gelsinger had experienced serious side
effects that might have been related to their therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman, Robert Consalvo, would not disclose details,
except to say that the Food and Drug Administration and the
National Institutes of Health had been notified. ``These were
reported prior to the Penn study death,'' Consalvo said. ``The
similarity is that we were using an intra-hepatic artery route of
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Gelsinger's death, the FDA temporarily halted two
Schering-Plough gene therapy experiments using adenovirus, one for
the treatment of liver cancer and another for colorectal cancer
that had spread to the liver. At the same time, the health
institutes office that oversees gene therapy has asked all
scientists using adenovirus vectors to submit data relating to
patient safety.
</P>
<P>
   The data will be made public Dec. 8 and 9 at a meeting of the
Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, the health institutes' panel
that reviews gene therapy protocols. In preparation for that
meeting, committee staff members, as well as FDA officials, have
been analyzing the safety reports in an attempt to determine if
there are connections between experiments that might shed light on
Gelsinger's death, or if there are circumstances in which the
adenovirus vector should no longer be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``The promise of adenovirus was that it's the common cold
virus,'' Dr. Amy Patterson, who directs the health institutes'
office that provides administrative support to the committee, said
in an interview last week. ``How bad could it be?''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Patterson said her office had been receiving ``disparate
reports'' of drops in platelet counts, fever and flu-like symptoms
among patients who received gene therapy with adenovirus. ``There
are enough reports now that we can start to piece together an
accurate description'' of what the patients experienced, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists already know that inactivated adenovirus causes an
inflammatory reaction and flu-like symptoms in patients who receive
it in experiments. There are currently about 50 gene therapy trials
using the adenovirus vector, and while its loss would not be a
devastating blow for the field, it would undoubtedly slow down
certain aspects of the research.
</P>
<P>
   While there there are other, safer versions of adenovirus vector
in development, said Dr. Savio Woo, president of the American
Society for Gene Therapy, they are not yet ready for testing in
patients. He described the virus in use today as the ``early
generation adenovirus.''
</P>
<P>
   Woo said that it was probably safe for scientists to inject the
early generation adenovirus directly into tumors or muscle. But he
said scientists would have to be extremely careful about putting it
into the bloodstream, at least until the cause of Gelsinger's death
is fully understood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know whether this particular incident is a freak
incident or the beginning of a trend,'' Woo said. ``That has to be
critically evaluated by the FDA'' and the the Recombinant DNA
Advisory Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The government's gene therapy inquiry comes amid growing concern
that some researchers and companies have not been entirely
forthcoming with information about the technology's harmful side
effects, as well as patient deaths from causes other than gene
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is how much information scientists and their companies
should share with their competitors in what is still a relatively
novel, and unsuccessful, field. Typically, companies experimenting
with new drugs and therapies are monitored by the FDA, which keeps
information about deaths and adverse reactions secret until a drug
is approved.
</P>
<P>
   But gene therapy has always been held to a higher standard. The
health institutes advisory committee was established in the early
days of the research to foster public discussion. But in recent
years, its role has been scaled back, and scientists have
apparently begun reporting primarily to the FDA, sidestepping the
health institutes' panel.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Their view is, if they go down a wrong path, why should they
tell their competitors?'' said Dr. Patterson of the health
institutes. But, she said, it is important that all deaths be
reported _ whether directly caused by gene therapy or not _ so that
the committee could publicize them and the public could learn from
them. ``We have a very obvious responsibility to make this
information generally known,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Schering-Plough has insisted that information about side effects
of gene therapy be classified as a propriatary trade secret. In
addition, a researcher at New York-Hospital Cornell Medical Center,
Dr. Ronald G. Crystal, reported to the NIH last year the death of a
heart disease patient in gene therapy trials but asked that it be
``kept confidential and not part of the public record.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, The Washington Post reported that six additional
deaths had been reported to the FDA, but not to the advisory
committee. The researchers involved, who include Crystal, said the
deaths had been caused by the patients' underlying disease, as
opposed to gene therapy, and so they did not believe they had to
report them.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal said on Wednesday that he suspected there had been
``literally scores of deaths'' among very sick patients who
participated in gene therapy trials. But he said he thought it
would unnecessarily violate patient confidentiality to publicly
discuss deaths that were not directly related to gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   As the debate continues, at least one critic, Jeremy Rifkin,
author of the the book ``Biotech Century'' and a longtime critic of
genetic research, says he is considering asking for a moratorium on
all gene therapy research until an independent panel can
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have too many red flags here,'' Rifkin said in an interview
on Monday. ``We have someone who is dead. And now we have some
scientists who are saying they want to keep private information
about their therapy trials. Is it time to introduce a short-term
moratorium until we have had an independent review?''

 &HT;    Braves a logical bidder with Griffey available
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ken Griffey Jr. an Atlanta Brave? It has moved from
scuttlebutt in July to full-fledged opportunity in November.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably the best player in baseball made his availability to
the Braves official Tuesday when he requested to be traded after 13
seasons in the Seattle Mariners organization.
</P>
<P>
   All eyes are on the Braves, who have emerged as the team with
the most talent to offer the Mariners and the money to lock up
Griffey after the next season. They also have the all-important
geographical proximity to Griffey's residence in Orlando, Fla.,
plus their spring-training complex there.
</P>
<P>
   Braves general manager John Schuerholz is tight-lipped as ever.
But he could be doing some listening to Seattle's new general
manager, Pat Gillick, when baseball's general managers meet this
weekend in Laguna Niguel, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz has said the Braves don't have weaknesses that can't
be addressed by the return of Andres Galarraga, Javy Lopez and
Kerry Ligtenberg. However, they still have plenty of motive to
consider this deal seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the Braves were a flop in the postseason. Putting
Griffey's bat into the lineup would give them instant credibility _
not to mention insurance, as Galarraga makes the difficult return
from cancer at age 38.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the appeal of Griffey possibly making a run at Hank
Aaron's career home-run record in the city where Aaron broke Babe
Ruth's record can't be denied.
</P>
<P>
   The cost to the Braves would be Andruw Jones, the 22-year-old
with enormous potential. Jones already is considered the best
defensive center fielder in the game, but his offensive progress
has been slow the last two years. Even so, Jones is the only
legitimate candidate in baseball to swap for Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, who are looking for four players in return, might
also ask for Kevin Millwood or John Rocker or both. The Braves,
however, would seem unlikely to be willing to part with either. A
team built around pitching would not want to give up the youngest
and most promising members of its staff.
</P>
<P>
   The big three of Greg Maddux, John Smoltz and Tom Glavine are
off limits, basically. They have 10 years of major-league service
each, including the last five with the Braves, giving them veto
power over any trades.
</P>
<P>
   Young pitchers Kevin McGlinchy and Bruce Chen could be
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners also could go after shortstop Rafael Furcal, the
Braves top minor-league prospect. Furcal would appeal to Seattle if
the Mariners are unable to re-sign Alex Rodriguez. They also might
look at minor-league second baseman Marcus Giles. Outfielder George
Lombard is a possibility, although his stock has fallen after a
disappointing AAA season.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Braves have reason to be cautious. The Mariners
are not expected to allow Griffey's potential new team any advance
contract conversation with him. It will be tougher on teams to
justify trading for a player who becomes eligible for free-agency
at the end of the 2000 season. Also, Griffey reportedly wants to
play out the 2000 season with his new team before entering into
contract discussions.
</P>
<P>
   With a payroll already at $75 million, the Braves have to see if
they have the money to sign Griffey and also extend Chipper Jones'
contract, at perhaps $12 million or more per season. Griffey, who
will make $9 million this season, rejected a July offer from the
Mariners that reportedly would have paid him nearly $17 million per
season for the next seven years. He said money wasn't the reason he
turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   General managers in Cincinnati and Cleveland already have said
they're interested in Griffey. Houston has an outside shot, but it
also has its own future free agents in Craig Biggio and Jeff
Bagwell. But the Braves should get the first chance, meaning that
their offseason might not be so quiet after all.

 _ SF CHRON   State Regulators Consider Dumping 11-Digit Phone Dialing 
 &HT;     By Deborah Solomon

<TEXT>
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; California residents would not have to dial 11 digits when making
a local phone call under a proposal submitted to state regulators
this week.
<P>
   A judge with the state Public Utilities Commission is
recommending that California halt the remaining ``overlays''
scheduled for the state, potentially putting to rest a contentious
issue that has gripped the PUC in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, if approved by the full commission, would relieve
the Bay Area from the four overlays slated to go into effect here.
Residents in the 408, 415, 510 and 650 area codes are all supposed
to get 11-digit dialing over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Overlays were implemented by the PUC to deal with the growing
shortage of phone numbers. Instead of dividing a region
geographically and giving customers in one half a new area code, an
overlay lets existing customers keep their area code and assigns a
new area code to new phone lines. However, everyone in the overlay
area must dial 11 digits _ 1 plus the area code and seven-digit
phone number _ on every call, even when making calls within their
own area code.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Thomas Pulsifer, an administrative law judge with
the PUC, recommended ending the overlays, saying they cause
confusion and disruption among customers.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal comes in the wake of the PUC's decision to end the
state's first overlay in the 310 area code. The overlay, which
began in April in the West Los Angeles region, caused severe
problems and prompted a huge consumer outcry. After it went into
effect, customers were unable to get through to some phone numbers
and some security systems did not work with 11-digit dialing.
</P>
<P>
   Pulsifer said that experience, combined with a recent decision
by the Federal Communications Commission that gives California more
flexibility in how it assigns phone numbers, should preclude the
need for overlays across the state.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the FCC gave California the right to hand out new
numbers to phone companies in blocks of 1,000 instead of 10,000.
The FCC also told the state it could require phone companies to
return any unused phone numbers so they could be reassigned to
other phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Both decisions should free more phone numbers for California.
Until now, phone companies had to get numbers in blocks of 10,000,
regardless of how many customers they had. They could not return
any unused portions, even if they only had 500 customers.
</P>
<P>
   Pulsifer is also recommending the state do a study to see how
many phone numbers are actually in use and ask the phone companies
to return any unused ones.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, consumer advocates, local politicians and state
legislators asked the PUC to end the overlays, saying they were bad
public policy.
</P>
<P>
   The full PUC is expected to vote on the proposed decision
December 2. While it's not clear how the five-member commission
will vote, the PUC has been under incredible pressure from
consumers, legislators and Gov. Gray Davis to do away with 11-digit
dialing.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates said if the proposal is approved, it will
benefit customers across the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is outstanding. It's good for consumers, who don't want
or need area code overlays,'' said Regina Costa, a
telecommunications analyst with The Utility Reform Network.

 Internet Pet Sites Vie for Bucks, Partnerships  &HT;     Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The online dog fight for the hearts and wallets of American pet
lovers got fiercer yesterday.
<P>
   Petstore.com of Emeryville announced $97 million in new
financing and a strategic alliance with Discovery Communications,
parent of the popular Animal Planet cable network.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, San Francisco's Pets.com said it has raised an
additional $35 million from Amazon.com and three venture capital
firms. And as a sign that Pets.com doesn't believe marketing wars
can be won with cash alone, the company staged an unusual dog show
last night at New York's Kit Kat Klub featuring ``Canine Couture''
from leading designers such as Todd Oldham and Donna Karan.
</P>
<P>
   The two online companies are vying in the highly competitive pet
food and supply market. In the United States alone, about 60
million households spend more than $30 billion on kibble and other
basics as well as tons of treats.
</P>
<P>
   In little more than a year, Petstore.com has raised close to
$110 million in cash, in-kind promotions and licensing agreements
to become the leading pet portal. Pets.com has raised nearly $100
million to fill the same niche.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Petopia.com, another San Francisco contender, raised
$66 million last July from a unit of France's Moet Hennessey Louis
Vuitton and Petco, one of the largest U.S. pet supply retailers.
Publicly traded Petsmart of Phoenix also is going after the
e-commerce customer.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest competitors are raising huge amounts of money to
build market share, establish partnerships and scare away would-be
rivals. As part of its deal with Discovery Communications of
Bethesda, Md., Petstore.com will get cash, exclusive license to
Animal Planet content, merchandise and its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Launched three years ago, Animal Planet is available in more
than 53 million U.S. homes. Petstore.com President Chris Luhnow
said that the partnership ``will allow us to create the first and
foremost destination for `all things animal.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Barrett, partner of the investment firm Battery Ventures,
added that the ``clicks-and-cable partnership will redefine the
landscape for Internet e-tailing.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its TV programming, Discovery sells hundreds of
products, including those made by the Nature Company, its Berkeley
subsidiary. Next year, it will also offer Animal Planet-branded
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Luhnow said that the new funds from Discovery as well as Battery
Ventures and Advanced Technology Ventures will be used to build the
business. Last week, the company opened its third and largest
warehouse in San Leandro. It also is opening a 75-seat customer
call center in Emeryville and this week it launched a national
advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pets.com landed another $35 million from original
investors Amazon.com and Hummer Winblad Venture Partners as well as
Bowman Capital Partners and Phoenix Capital Partners.
</P>
<P>
   While Petstore.com has more veterinarians and animal
behaviorists on show at its Web site, Pets.com has displayed more
flair.
</P>
<P>
   At last night's ``Fashion Goes to the Dogs'' benefit for
fighting AIDS and aiding animal humane organizations, ``futuristic
Fido'' fashions were on display. Dogs escorted by Ford Agency
models wore coats with connected leashes, doggie vests that turn
into umbrellas, and outfits with pockets to hold doggie snacks and
the owner's cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   The collection will tour several cities, including San
Francisco, next year.

 State Opens Door to Union At UC Hospitals  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
A state board has ruled that 2,000 residents and interns at three
University of California hospitals are employees, not students,
clearing the way for them to hold an unprecedented union election.
<P>
   The ruling issued this week by the Public Employment Relations
Board in Sacramento affects interns and residents working at UC San
Francisco, UC Davis and UC Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The decision comes at a time when doctors are considering unions
as a way to counter cuts in the medical industry.
</P>
<P>
   Legal observers said the UC decision could influence the
National Labor Relations Board, which is mulling whether to reverse
a 1976 federal decision that deemed interns and residents as
students _ preventing some 85,000 residents at private and
nonprofit hospitals in the United States from unionizing.
</P>
<P>
   A UC official said that if the ruling stands, it would give
doctors-in-training at UC Irvine and UC San Diego similar
organizing rights. UC has 20 days in which to seek an appeal of the
board's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't made a decision,'' said UC attorney Jim Odell.
</P>
<P>
   The case began in 1996, when UC opposed an organizing drive by
the University of California Association of Interns and Residents,
saying medical students were not covered by state labor laws.
</P>
<P>
   `'Throughout this litigation, the university has taken the
position that the nature of their duties makes them primarily
students,'' said UC spokesman Brad Hayward.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers challenged the UC position before the state
board, which arbitrates labor disputes involving state agencies.
After San Francisco administrative law judge James Tamm ruled in
favor of the union in 1998, UC appealed his verdict to the board,
which decided this week that interns and residents did enough work
to deserve union representation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Andrea Cervenka, president of the intern and residents
group, said the ruling gives her union the chance to schedule
elections sometime early next year, when 700 residents at each of
the three campuses will be asked whether the union should bargain
for them.
</P>
<P>
   Interns are trainees fresh out of medical school who earn about
$29,000 a year, Cervenka said. Residents are in their second, third
or subsequent years of training, and earn from $33,000 to $37,000
annually. When they complete training and become certified
physicians, their salaries typically jump to $90,000 or more, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the money as much as it is the working conditions,''
Cervenka said. ``Residents work 36-hour shifts and 120-hour weeks.
You don't want to be the patient who gets seen at the end of one of
those weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time UC interns and residents have fought
for the right to organize _ and won in the courts. In 1986, after a
seven-year legal battle, the California Supreme Court declared
interns to be workers with organizing rights.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the ruling came down, however, the Physician's
National House Staff Association had collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say the intern and residents union itself nearly came
apart during its battle with UC, but was held together by its
affiliation with two more experienced national unions, the
Committee on Interns and Residents, and Service Employees
International Union.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Scherzer, associate director of the Committee on Interns
and Residents, said the general climate toward physician's unions
is more receptive than it was 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Scherzer is hopeful the new group will win union status at the
three UC medical centers, swelling his organization's ranks by 20
percent. But he said the larger target remains overturing the NLRB
ban.
</P>
<P>
   But Stanford law professor Bill Gould, a former NLRB chairman,
said residents elsewhere shouldn't hold their breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pressure from the Republicans in Congress is preventing the
NLRB from issuing a decision,'' said Gould, who tried and failed to
get the resident ban reversed before he left Washington, D.C., in
August 1998.

 NBC Peacock Tries to Frighten Away Other Suitors for KRON  &HT;     By Dan Fost 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The bidding for San Francisco television station KRON (Channel 4)
closes today with five media firms vying for the local NBC
affiliate.
<P>
   The contestants are NBC itself, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.,
Gannett Co., Young Broadcasting and Lin Television.
</P>
<P>
   NBC is playing hardball in its attempt to gain control of its
local affiliate. But its pre-emptive $700 million bid earlier this
week was rejected almost immediately by Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, the investment bank handling the sale of KRON.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the bidding aid NBC made its offer around 6:30
p.m. EST on Monday. Two hours earlier, a blurb appeared on trade
publication Electronic Media's online site at www.emonline.com,
reporting NBC's offer and noting that the network _ a division of
the giant General Electric _ wanted a 30-day exclusive negotiating
period, ``and if that is not granted by Wednesday, NBC may not bid
on the station at all.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't granted, the sources say &LR;  said.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has been unusually aggressive in pursuing KRON. Last month,
it sent the investment bank a letter saying, in effect, that if
someone else bought KRON, the network might not give them such a
favorable affiliation deal. The letter was seen as a tactic to
discourage other bidders.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the special consideration, don't count NBC out yet.
The Peacock may still decide to pony up for KRON.
</P>
<P>
   That's because one of the bidders is likely to be Murdoch's News
Corp., the parent of the Fox broadcast network. If Murdoch gets
hold of KRON, he could move the local Fox station off Channel 2
(KTVU), which is owned by Cox Communications, and therefore own his
own affiliate. That would leave NBC scrambling to switch to KTVU.
</P>
<P>
   Although anything is possible, A.H. Belo Corp., owner of the
Dallas Morning News and numerous TV stations _ identified in a Wall
Street Journal story as a likely bidder _ has not been actively
kicking KRON's tires, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   One other local media possibility in the sale is the uncertain
fate of the Marin Independent Journal if Gannett ends up with KRON.
Federal Communications Commission rules prohibit ownership of a
television station and a newspaper in the same market; if Gannett
buys KRON, it might have to unload the Marin IJ. Officials at
Gannett refused to comment. (Full disclosure: As a former employee
of the IJ, I own Gannett stock.)
</P>
<P>
   The folks selling KRON are the same ones who earlier this year
agreed to sell The Chronicle to the Hearst Corp. Chronicle
Publishing Co. is selling off all of its assets; it's already
unloaded The Chronicle and two other newspapers, and the next week
could see deals announced for two book publishing companies and two
Midwestern television stations. KRON would then be the last, and
most lucrative, property sold.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ALOHA, EXAMINER?:But the sale of The Chronicle to Hearst is not a
done deal yet. Legal maneuverings in the closing of a Hawaii
newspaper are coming ashore in San Francisco and could influence
the fate of the two dailies here.
</P>
<P>
   In Hawaii, the afternoon Honolulu Star-Bulletin had announced
its intention to close as of October 31, but the state sued the
Star-Bulletin and the morning Honolulu Advertiser, saying a
one-paper town would violate antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge ordered the Star-Bulletin to keep publishing
until the lawsuit is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Briefs in the Hawaii case are due this week at the U.S. Court of
Appeals in San Francisco, and the court will probably rule before
the end of the month, according to Stephen Barnett, a law professor
at the University of California at Berkeley who is following the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be the Justice Department will wait for that decision
before deciding what it wants to do about the San Francisco case,''
Barnett said. That's because the ruling will be ``precedent
setting,'' Barnett said, spelling out how newspapers can proceed in
dismantling a joint operating agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Honolulu differs from San Francisco in that Hearst has put the
afternoon Examiner up for sale, while Star-Bulletin owner Liberty
Newspapers wants to close its paper without even seeking a buyer.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the San Francisco deal say Hearst's sale
attempts are a sham. Justice Department lawyers are in town combing
through records now.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst has received some bids for the Examiner, but they might
be off the mark. New Times, the Arizona parent of the SF Weekly, is
interested in buying the Examiner's news racks, but not in keeping
the Examiner alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't afford to buy the Examiner,'' said New Times Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Jim Larkin, who is based in San
Francisco. But if the intention is to preserve diverse editorial
voices, he said, the Weekly offers just such a voice and should be
sold the news racks and distribution arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was given the bum's rush out of there,'' Larkin said. ``We
were told that two bidders were interested in the whole
megillah,cq &LR;  which I don't think is accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FORTUNE FOR A HERRING? The folks at Red Herring magazine got a
chuckle about the news that Fortune plans to launch a new San
Francisco magazine to cover the Internet economy. That's because
Fortune came to the Bay Area last year and poked around the Herring
and a number of other tech publications before deciding to start up
its own venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came through the valley, looked at Business 2.0, Red
Herring, the Industry Standard _ they took a look at everybody,
gathering information to see if the market was full, if they should
invest in one, buy one or start one,'' said Herring Publisher Ted
Gramkow. ``They gathered the market was strong enough to support an
additional publication. We welcome all comers.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortune's eCompany Unlimited _ which will be a stand-alone
monthly magazine, not a supplement, as I reported last week _ will
compete for stories and ads in the crowded marketplace Gramkow
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Will eCompany be any different? Its editor and president says it
will.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge appetite for reading about the Internet in
general and more specifically how it's changing business,'' said
Ned Desmond.
</P>
<P>
   There's ``room for another one,'' Desmond said, ``as long as
you're the best. ... As they say in Silicon Valley, it's all in the
execution. If we don't do a good job, we won't be around for
long.''

BILL TO COMBAT DRUG TRAFFIC CAUGHT IN LOBBYING BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Fla., Neb., MEXICO)  (js) 
 By TIM WEINER with TIM GOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Efforts by the Republican chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee to soften a bill that would expand economic
sanctions against drug traffickers and the businesses that work
with them has touched off a furious dispute on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   His aides say that the chairman, Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama,
is merely trying to fix flawed legislation that might allow
overzealous government officials to seize the assets of legitimate
companies tied to drug trafficking by scant evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But some of Shelby's fellow Republicans have taken unusually
vehement exception to his stance, suggesting that opponents of the
law have been influenced by Washington lobbyists working for
companies that might be affected by the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have discovered in this Congress that we are not insulated
by the efforts of the kingpins to buy influence and corrupt our
political institutions,'' Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., a member of
the House intelligence committee, said on the floor shortly before
the legislation passed overwhelmingly Tuesday night. ``Their
narco-lobbyists were paid well to try to shape and gut this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   McCollum did not mention Shelby or name any of the lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation has run into trouble in the Senate where Shelby
and a few of his colleagues, including the Democratic vice chairman
of the intelligence panel, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, have raised
objections.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Shelby said he would like to see the bill amended so
that potential targets of the law would have strong protections.
Assets could not be seized without a legal finding that the
companies were deliberately involved in the drug trade. Shelby,
aides said, also wants provisions that could protect the assets of
owners or subsidiaries of drug-trafficking firms which are not
themselves connected to the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the bill has been orchestrated by some of
Washington's most powerful law firms, according to congressional
aides who have been the subject of their lobbying. The most
prominent of those firms, Verner, Lipfert, Bernhard, McPherson &AMP;
Hand, a lobbying firm that employs the former Senate majority
leader Bob Dole, has been hired by Transportacion Maritima
Mexicana, the biggest transit company in Mexico. The company has
fought vigorously to clear its name after news accounts were
published that quoted U.S. intelligence reports as tying it to the
drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   John Merrigan, a partner at Verner, Lipfert, said his Mexican
client had been put in the impossible position of having to refute
untrue reports based on anonymous sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been proposing in every forum, at every stage that
this legislation provide for the full prosecution of drug
traffickers and their associates,'' Merrigan said. ``On the other
hand, we have serious concerns that the bill may not even provide
minimal due process, judicial review, or other reasonable
protections for innocent companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrigan acknowledged that his firm had paid particular
attention to Shelby and other members of the Senate Intelligence
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby declined to answer questions about the legislation, his
role in it, and the dismissal of one of his staff members, who had
said in an interview that he lost his job because he opposed the
senator's efforts to reshape or block the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence committee chairman referred questions to his
press secretary, Andrea Andrews, who said it was ``completely
untrue'' that his objections were based in anything but the desire
to improve a faulty bill. As for the dismissed staff member of the
intelligence committee, J.K. Stinebower, she said: ``The primary
reasons for his dismissal had nothing to do with this
legislation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Stinebower played an important role in drafting the bill and
pushing it forward. He said he was dismissed for continuing to try
to produce a tough bill after his boss, Shelby, changed his views.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fired for my work in initiating and drafting the bill,''
Stinebower said. ``The phrase they used was my `failure to follow
the priorities and directives of the chairman.''' He said he had
also been accused of abusing his annual leave.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., a principal sponsor of the
drug-trafficking legislation, said it was ``being bottled up'' by
concerns voiced by Shelby and Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., who also
sits on the Senate intelligence committee.
</P>
<P>
   No public hearings have been held on the legislation, which was
passed as a separate bill in the House and is attached to the
Senate bill authorizing intelligence activities.
</P>
<P>
   The ranking Democratic senator on the intelligence committee,
Kerrey, said public hearings on the bill should be held in the
Senate to determine its potential impact on trade. Mexican business
have expressed concerns that companies unknowingly associated with
firms connected to drug-running might be damaged by the law.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey disputed the notion that lobbyists _ ``K Street,'' in
Washington shorthand _ were steering the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that K Street is rolling us is false,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation looked as if it was sailing through the Senate
until late in September. Then, according to Republican and
Democratic members of Congress, a new draft version of the
legislation appeared from Shelby's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It suddenly appeared about a month ago,'' said Coverdell. ``I
know that Verner-Lipfert has been involved, promoting language that
we feel nullifies the legislation _ that makes it not work.''
Documents circulated in Congress by the firm, and provided by
congressional aides, advocate changes similar to those proposed by
Shelby.
</P>
<P>
   The key element, he and other members of Congress said, was
language in the bill that said a target of the law would have to be
a ``knowing, willful and intentional'' drug trafficker and that the
target could go to court to keep the government from invoking the
law.
</P>
<P>
   These changes, according to Treasury Department officials and
supporters of the bill, like Coverdell, would make it unworkable.
And a staff member of Congress involved in the process called the
influence of the lobbyists and their clients on the bill ``one of
the smelliest things i've ever seen, if not the smelliest.''
</P>
<P>
   The issues in question may be subtler than the allegations of
influence, however. They include free trade, intelligence, U.S.
counternarcotics efforts and the interplay of law and lobbying. The
way they play out will be determined by negotiations between the
Senate and the House in coming days.

 Software Lets Users Scribble Comments  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
A $49.99 software package slated for release next month could make
it almost as easy to jot and scribble on digital documents as on
the proverbial paper napkin.
<P>
   The new program, called Enotate, will let users add handwritten
notes and sketches to files displayed on their PC screens. The only
hardware required will be a 3Com Palm or Palm clone, devices which
are already used by some 5 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Developed by Santa Clara's Informal Software, Enotate will make
it easy for users to draw a map, sketch a rough layout for a
product or brochure, highlight key passages in a document, jot
comments or questions on reports and presentations, and add
captions to digital photographs. For people who like to edit the
old-fashioned way, Enotate lets you draw lines and circles and put
notes in the margins.
</P>
<P>
   Informal Software's founder and CEO, Ian Cullimore, played key
roles in the creation of two of the first handheld computers, the
Atari Portfolio and Poqet Computer's Poqet PC. At least initially,
Enotate will be sold only on Informal's Web site, www.informal.com.
</P>
<P>
   The first version of the program will let users add handwritten
markings and comments only to Microsoft Word and PowerPoint
documents and to digital photos in the industry-standard JPEG
format. Later versions will add support for Microsoft Excel and
other popular applications, and will give users the option of
making their marks on Windows CE handhelds and eventually ``smart
phones'' instead of Palm products.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has the potential to be as important as the
mouse,'' said Jim Soriano, an Enotate tester and chief technologist
at Xircom in Thousand Oaks (Ventura County). ``It's about as close
as you can get to the informality of a pen and paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Soriano said he uses the product to draw maps, to edit business
documents _ by circling or striking out passages and adding written
comments _ and to jot notes on digital photos of his young
daughter, which he then e-mails to his brother.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm-Enotate combination, Soriano said, ``has the best
chance of anything I've seen yet to become the fourth standard
peripheral for PCs,'' alongside the keyboard, mouse and monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts have predicted that voice-recognition software
would fill that slot, but those programs don't yet deliver the
speed and accuracy that would satisfy most users. Besides, Soriano
noted, ``talking to your PC is still somewhat embarrassing for most
people,'' at least in the work environment, whereas ``moving a pen
on a surface is just so natural.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Purdy, founder and CEO of Mobile Insights, a Mountain View
market research company, said Enotate creates ``a new paradigm that
could become part of the daily routine for many computer users.''
It will, he said, ``make it easy to do things you could only do
with a PC now by adding a digitizer to the screen, which is
expensive and not very comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Enotate includes software for both the handheld device and the
PC. Once it's installed on the two machines, and they're connected
via a serial cable (standard equipment with Palm products), a
rectangular box the same size as the Palm screen appears on the PC
monitor whenever Word, PowerPoint or Informal's own JPEG-editing
application is launched.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of any text or graphics inside the box appears on the
Palm's black-and-white screen. You can move the box around the
document, so you can see and mark different parts of it, using only
the plastic stylus that comes with Palm devices.
</P>
<P>
   To annotate a document, you simply write or draw with the stylus
directly on the handheld screen. Markings appear in real time on
the PC monitor as well as on the handheld screen. Cursive or
block-printed text appears as written. Enotate does not use
Graffiti, the technology Palm uses to translate written letters
into editable digital text.
</P>
<P>
   Controls on the Palm screen will let users vary the color of
their virtual ink, the width of their pen and other formatting
features. Annotations and drawings are saved within the Word,
PowerPoint or JPEG file; they'll be visible to anyone else
subsequently opening the file, even if he doesn't have Enotate on
his own machine.
</P>
<P>
   Informal, however, will provide a lightweight viewer application
Enotate users can include when they send annotated documents to
others. The viewer will let the recipients remove annotations, but
not add their own, unless they also have the full Enotate software
installed.
</P>
<P>
   A command within Enotate can send the current document directly
to the user's e-mail program.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Palm-branded handhelds, Enotate will work with
other Palm OS products, such as IBM's WorkPad and Handspring's new
Visor series.
</P>
<P>
   Although Enotate is apparently the first program that will let
users easily add handwritten notations to ordinary PC documents,
it's not the first to convert handhelds into PC-input devices.
</P>
<P>
   WriteHere, from Foundation Systems of Palo Alto, uses the
handwriting-recognition capabilities of Palm devices and Apple's
now-orphaned Newton to enable users to write on handhelds and have
the text appear in digital form within a PC or Mac document.

DOLE TO ANNOUNCE EARNINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTLAKE VILLAGE -- With Europeans curbing their appetite for
bananas, Dole Food Co. Thursday is scheduled to report that
third-quarter earnings have slipped dramatically from year-ago
levels.
</P>
<P>
   The grower and marketer of fruits and flowers -- based in the
Westlake Village area of northwestern Los Angeles County -- is
expected to report a loss of 3 cents per share for the quarter,
said a poll of four analysts by First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Dole earned 26 cents a share in the 1998 third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The company gave Wall Street ample warning of the disappointing
results.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Dole expected to earn 13 cents per share for the
quarter. But on Sept. 20, the company advised investors that
earnings would likely be well below that level.
</P>
<P>
   Company chairman David Murdock said the company would just break
even at best for the quarter because of price weaknesses from an
oversupply of the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   That situation resulted from an increased allocation of banana
licenses into the European Union for the third quarter and
continued softness in demand from Eastern Europe and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, lower-than-expected prices in the fresh-cut
flowers division and the negative effects from last year's citrus
freeze also contributed to lower earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Also the company continues to feel the impact of costs
associated with the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   As these factors abate, the company expects its financial
picture to improve.
</P>
<P>
   Dole had 1998 revenues of $4.4 billion. It is the world's
largest producer and marketer of high-quality fresh fruit and
vegetables, and markets a line of packaged foods and fresh flowers.

 MAC Q&AMP;A/HENRY NORR  Not All Mac Programs Ready for Y2K 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: A few months ago, you mentioned in your column that even though
Mac hardware and the Mac OS are Year 2000-ready, some Mac
applications may not be. Can you provide any more details?
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Thanks for an important reminder, because Mac users can't afford
to be complacent on this issue. Current versions of most Mac
applications seem to be ``Y2K compliant'' _ in other words, they
will work properly with dates after Jan. 1, 2000 _ but earlier
versions of some very common programs could cause serious problems.
</P>
<P>
   The most complete source of information on this subject that
I've found is Richard Barron's ``Not-So-Compliant List,'' which is
regularly updated at a Web site called Macnologist.com
(www.macnologist.com/y2k/). You owe it to yourself to skim through
it, see if any applications or utilities you use are listed as
noncompliant, and, if so, pursue the links on the list until you've
found an upgrade _ or an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds too hard, a utility called Y2K App Checker for
Macintosh, created by Blue Line Studios of Basel, Switzerland, will
automatically check the applications installed on your hard drive
against Barron's list. You can find both a free version and $20
``Professional Edition'' at www.blueline-studios.com/ykMain.html.
</P>
<P>
   Another Y2K checker, which I haven't tried, is Year 2000
Software Audit from Pedagoguery Software. Both the full program,
which costs $38, and a free but limited demo version are available
at www.peda.com/y2ksa/.
</P>
<P>
   Among the popular programs you may need to update:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Apple's own FileMaker Pro. For details, read the Year 2000
Disclosure and Q&AMP;A files listed at
www.filemaker.com/support/y2k.html.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Several products from CE Software. These include older versions of
QuickMail Pro and versions prior to 3.5.3 of the QuicKeys keyboard
shortcut utility. QuickMail Pro client and server updates are free,
but if you use QuicKeys 3.0 or earlier, you'll have to pay for an
upgrade to the current release, version 4.1, which will cost you
$50. See www.cesoft.com/y2k/y2khome.html.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Global Village fax software prior to GlobalFax 3.0.6. In other
words, the software that came with many of the company's PowerBook
fax modems is not Y2K-compliant. If you own any Global Village
product, check it at
www.globalvIllage.com/support/softwarelocator.html.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Intuit's Quicken personal finance program and QuickBooks small
business accounting package. For details, start at www.intuit.com
/corporate/year2000/findyourproduct.html.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Version 4.0 of Outlook Express, Microsoft's free e-mail program.
(Version 4.01, which was included with Mac OS 8.5 and 8.6, and
later releases, including the current 5.0, are safe, according to
Microsoft.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Version 3.0x of Microsoft's Internet Explorer Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Microsoft Excel. Various versions of the industry-standard
spreadsheet handle dates with two-digit years inconsistently (see
support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q164/4/06.ASP). Even
though the current version, Excel 98, is officially Y2K-compliant,
Microsoft strongly recommends that you convert all such references
to four-digit format. You can find Wizards that help with the
conversion at
support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q193/3/44.asp?PRCHS&AMP;T17d
&AMP;SU.  &QL; 
Mac Incompatibility
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I've heard rumors that Mac OS 9 is incompatible with a lot of
Mac models and a lot of third-party products. Is that true?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: In a word, yes. The latest version of Apple's operating system,
which just came out at the end of last month, requires an Apple
computer with a PowerPC chip and at least 32 megabytes of RAM. (If
you have less than 40 megabytes of real RAM, you'll need to keep
virtual memory on.) Officially, Apple didn't test and doesn't
support the new OS on Mac clones, although it seems to work
normally on such systems.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger problem is that Mac OS 9 conflicts with some of the
software and peripherals most widely used by Mac owners. The list
includes Adobe Type Manager, version 4.5.1 and earlier, and pre-4.0
versions of Adobe Acrobat; a number of utilities from Aladdin
Systems, including StuffIt Deluxe and StuffIt Expander, the
decompression utility I recommended here just last month;
Connectix' RAM Doubler, Speed Doubler, and versions of Virtual PC
prior to 2.1.2; versions of Dantz Development's Retrospect prior to
4.1E; and all versions of Symantec's Norton Utilities and Norton
AntiVirus for Macintosh prior to the recently released versions 5.0
of the former and 6.0 of the latter.
</P>
<P>
   There are even problems with some of Apple's own software. All
versions of ClarisWorks and AppleWorks prior to 5.04 are
incompatible with Mac OS 9. So is Final Cut Pro, a video-editing
program Apple released just a few months ago. And some features of
HyperCard, which the company is no longer updating, reportedly slow
to glacial speeds.
</P>
<P>
   On the hardware side, Mac OS 9 conflicts with Kingston
Technology's EtheRx PCI 10/100 Ethernet cards. It's also
incompatible with a long list of Hewlett-Packard inkjet printers,
including the DeskWriter 600, 660, 680 and 690 series and the
DeskJet 610, 612, 670, 680, 690, 850, 855 and 870 series.
</P>
<P>
   In short, proceed with caution. For further information and
links to vendor sites, check the special reports posted and
regularly updated on MacInTouch (www.macintouch.com/m90.html) and
MacFixIt (www.macfixit.com/reports/macos9.shtml).
</P>
<P>
   Macadam Computers, for my money San Francisco's best Mac dealer,
also provides a hard-copy list of incompatibilities. It's located
at 1062 Folsom St., between Sixth and Seventh streets.

ROCKFISHERS SOON TO TAKE BIG HIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Here we go again. Another proposal to ban
recreational rockfishing along the Southern California coast. This
one, however, has some very real teeth and a
will-get-done-immediately attitude.
</P>
<P>
   It's all very complicated, but essentially the state is striving
to closely match significant new angling restrictions proposed by
national fishery managers. Included in the language is a moratorium
on all rockfishing in January and February _ the very heart of the
rockfishing season _ and a reduction in bag limits during the
remainder of the year. The move is part of a West Coast-wide effort
to restore depleted stocks of rockfish and other related fish.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike a separate open-ended plan by the state government to
iron out better definitions for marine protected areas _ which may
lead to a ban of commercial harvesting and sport-fishing along
portions of the northernmost Channel Islands _ the federal
blueprint to manifest statewide changes in fishing regulations
!ital!has!off! a date it will go into effect: Jan. 1. The state
Fish and Game Commission _ the agency responsible for such matters
in California _ is largely on board; apparently all that is left to
do is cross the Ts and dot the Is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, these are the options we are considering,'' said Bob
Treanor, executive director of the Fish and Game Commission's
staff. ``I guess that is the nature of the process. We have a wide
range of suggestions, recommendations, alternatives to consider;
you narrow it down based on recommendations from the department (of
Fish and Game) and the public.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fish and Game Commission meets Friday beginning at 8:30 a.m.
at Hubbs-Sea World Research Institution at 2595 Ingraham St. in San
Diego _ for information, call the commission office at (916)
653-4899 _ to hear public comment, yet little change is expected to
come of it. The commission has set Dec. 3 at its next meeting in
Sacramento as the date to adopt the policy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, also on Friday, the Pacific Fishery Management
Council _ the Portland, Ore.-based federal arm of this process _ is
expected to hear its own regulation proposals next week. If all
goes according to plan, if the state's propositions are on the same
page as that of the feds or vice versa, new
recreational-rockfishing restrictions will be on the books Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In much of Southern California, saltwater angling in winter is
defined by rockfishing. It will have to be redefined. Among
considerations other than the two-month rockfishing moratorium:
</P>
<P>
   _Reducing the general rockfish bag limit from 15 to 10 or 12.
</P>
<P>
   _Reducing the cow rockfish (cowcod) limit from 10 to zero or
one, with a boat limit of five cowcod.
</P>
<P>
   _Reducing the canary rockfish limit from 10 to two or three.
</P>
<P>
   _Reducing the bocaccio limit from three to two.
</P>
<P>
   _Limiting rockfish or lingcod hooks to three per line instead of
an unlimited number of hooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is science that says we have a problem, we have to do
something,'' Treanor explained. ``The commission knows that the
sportfishing hasn't created the problem, but everybody has got to
share in the pain of rebuilding the resources. We are not just
focusing on sportfishermen; commercial anglers also are being
targeted. Commercials take the vast majority of the fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Treanor said it is thought that 85 percent of rockfish takes are
by commercial endeavors. Yet such rockfishing limitations not only
impact the recreational angler, but also those employed in the
sport-fishing industry. And the impending regulations will
significantly change the atmosphere at oceanside landings that
depend on wintertime rockfishing for survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that definitely some measures need to be taken to
protect rockfish,'' said Fred Benko of Santa Barbara, skipper of
the Condor out of Santa Barbara's Sea Landing. ``I hate to see the
lion's share of the mitigation measures fall on the shoulders of
the recreational fishermen, though. The current proposal is to drop
by either a third or a half of our catch limit and to shut fishing
down altogether for a couple of months, January and February, which
(fishery officials) surmise are the worst weather months of the
year when actually those of us who fish the area know January and
February are a couple of the best-weather months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be very tough on the majority of the charter
fleet, especially in the northern part of this range, say from
Oxnard, Ventura, Santa Barbara and Morro Bay, because rockfish is
the bread-and-butter catch. It's pretty hard to charge somebody
$60, $70, and, in our case, $80 to go fishing when they can only
catch a seven-fish bag limit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By taking (those in the charter fleet) off the water, they are
going to have to find some way to earn a living for a couple of
months and many of the charter operators, especially the small-boat
fleet, are very close to the edge all the time,'' said Benko, whose
situation may not be as bleak, since in winter months he
complements his recreational rockfishing business with
whale-watching tours. ``This has always been a lifestyle profession
and not a way for anyone to make great quantities of money. So it
has a real serious deleterious effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Treanor takes exception at the notion that only recreational
anglers are being impacting by any new rockfishing restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a misconception that is out there,'' he said.
``Commercial anglers are taking some very large hits. The Pacific
Fishery Management Council is dealing with the offshore trawlers.''
</P>
<P>
   And the inshore commercial fisherman will be dealt with by the
state, though that process is in the works. The state Marine Life
Management Act that went into effect this year gives the state Fish
and Game Commission authority over nearshore commercial-fishing
regulations. ``But,'' Treanor said, ``development of the management
plan is two years off, so the department (of Fish and Game) is
looking at interim management recommendations because we need to
address this action.''

   LOS ANGELES -- With their acquisition of a Florida insurance
company still a drain on its revenues, Zenith National Insurance
Corp. is expected Thursday to report third-quarter earnings 32
cents lower than the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   A poll of three analysts by First Call predicts the workers'
compensation insurer will report a loss of 20 cents for the 1999
third-quarter compared to a profit of 12 cents a share for the same
period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Zenith National attributed the loss to a $32.5 million cut in
third-quarter net income reserves that were needed to cover claims
on policies sold by Sarasota-based insurer Riscorp, which the
company purchased in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Riscorp wasn't as good of a deal as Zenith originally
thought,'' said Gary Ransom, an analyst with Conning &AMP; Co. in
Hartford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a gradual turnaround, but it will be difficult
and won't happen for the next couple of quarters,'' Ransom said.
</P>
<P>
   Zenith National warned nearly three weeks ago of a third-quarter
loss due to continued softness in workers' compensation insurance
market where competition has led to price cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a difficult market in California,'' said Ransom.
``Premiums have declined, squeezing the margins.'' Seventy-eight
percent of Zenith's workers' compensation policies are written in
California.
</P>
<P>
   The third-quarter charge, which amounts to $1.89 a share, will
be offset in the next four years as the company recognizes $16.5
million a year from reinsurance, the company said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Zenith closed down 18.75 cents Wednesday at $22.25.

DISNEY TO RELEASE EARNINGS REPORT

<P>
   &LR; BURBANK -- The news about Walt Disney Co. has been so negative
for so long it no longer has much impact on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   When Walt Disney Co. releases yet another downbeat quarterly
earnings report Thursday for its fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, the
effect will probably be minimal unless the numbers are well under
the First Call consensus forecast of 10 cents a share. That would
represent a decline of 28 percent from profits of $296 million, or
14 cents a share, in the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect of the earnings report is likely to be
insignificant unless it's a blowout on the downside of something
under 8 cents a share,'' said Barry Hyman, an analyst with
Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum who has forecasted 10 cents a share. ``I
look at film to have a decent quarter, so there could be a penny of
upside surprise. I'm also looking for further progress at ABC.''
</P>
<P>
   But, lacking a stunning revelation, Wall Street will likely have
little reaction. ``There's not much focus on this quarter,''
admitted Linda Bannister of Edward Jones &AMP; Co., who is near the
high end of estimates with 13 cents. ``What will be more important
is what the executives say at the analyst meeting at Disney
headquarters next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Many institutional investors abandoned the stock, which was
trading above $42 as recently as May 1998, when the Burbank-based
entertainment giant began reporting disappointing earnings last
year due to a multitude of problems at ABC, its Disney Stores
retail chain and its home video and consumer products divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The stock has not traded over $30 since June and will likely
stay in the mid-$20s until the middle of next year since short-term
investors are now avoiding the stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street is pretty unforgiving,'' said Steve Cesinger, a
media analyst with investment bank Greif &AMP; Co. ``Everybody believes
the stock is not going anywhere in the near term. As an
institutional investor, you live by how your performance is
compared to the S&AMP;P 500 quarter to quarter so the institutions that
now own Disney are likely to be those with a long horizon.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Disney closed up 43.75 cents at $26.875 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cesinger said the power of Disney's brand names _ Disneyland,
Disney World, ESPN, ABC _ have created a double-edged sword for the
company. On the one hand, the company still has growth potential
but doing so when it already generates $25 billion in annual sales
is difficult even with Chairman Michael Eisner's focus this year on
cost-cutting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see Eisner's cost initiatives having an impact for
another six to nine months,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman agreed, saying, ``They're doing what's necessary, but it's
a long-term situation. Right now, they're at the precipice of a
turnaround.''

   LOS ANGELES -- Despite massive lawsuits that threaten the
long-term financial stability of the managed-care industry,
Foundation Health Systems Inc. is expected to report third-quarter
earnings nearly 50 percent higher than the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   A poll of 16 analysts by First Call predicts the Woodland
Hills-based managed care company today will report earnings of 31
cents per share for the 1999 third-quarter, compared with 21 cents
for the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have only begun to see these lawsuits being filed,'' said
Todd Richter, an analyst with Bank of America Securities in San
Francisco. ``Both large and small managed-care companies will have
legal action brought against them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These lawsuits have more merit than those in the health care
industry would have you believe . . . and will be a cloud hanging
over the industry for the next five to 10 years,'' added Richter.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, several of the country's most powerful
attorneys turned their attention from suing tobacco companies to
filing class-action lawsuits on behalf of clients claiming health
maintenance organizations had denied patient benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Richter describes Foundation Health as a company that has done a
``very solid job building a core group of assets they can control.
It's hard to see how they are going to grow their business without
a unique position in any product or market.''
</P>
<P>
   In a printed statement, Foundation Health Systems said it offers
HMOs, administration of government health contracts, life insurance
and specialty plans such as dental and vision care services.
</P>
<P>
   Formed in April 1997 from the merger of Health Systems
International and Foundation Health Corp., Foundation Health is the
nation's fourth-largest publicly traded managed-care company. FHS
serves 6 million members in California, Arizona, Florida and the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Foundation Health Systems Inc. closed up 25 cents, or
2.7 percent, Wednesday at $9.4375.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Peter John Giles didn't have any doubts about what he
wanted to do with his life when he graduated from college about
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The handsome, green-eyed young man loved being near the water
and had spent most summers in Alaska working on fishing boats his
grandfather and uncles owned. At 22, Giles left his parents behind
in Libertyville, Ill., and went to work for his two uncles in their
shipyard business on the northside of Lake Union. He told his
family the shipyard was his future.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, that future was stolen when a gunman killed Giles and
coworker Russ Brisendine and wounded two others.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy just barged into the office and killed my grandson
and wounded three others,'' said his shaken 82-year-old
grandfather, Richard Kelly. ``It's just a terrible thing. Who would
expect decent law-abiding citizens to get just shot down in cold
blood?''
</P>
<P>
   Giles came to Seattle to be Northlake Shipyard's book-keeper and
general manager, his grandfather said. His easy smile and upbeat,
energetic personality soon made him a favorite around the shipyard.
Kelly said his grandson's hard work also won him the trust of his
uncles, Richard Kelly, Jr. and Peter Kelly, ownNorthlake
Shipyard Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he really liked his uncles, and, of course, the fact
that he didn't have to put on a tie,'' his grandfather said.
</P>
<P>
   Giles' uncles, who are Richard Kelly's sons, relied on him so
much that they left the 27-year-old in charge of the shipyard this
week when they went away on vacation, Richard Kelly Jr. to Mexico,
and Peter Kelly to Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, he was the one left there to manage the
business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Giles died at the scene. Brisendine, a 43-year-old marine
engineer at the shipyard, died later at Harborview Medical Center
from multiple gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Brisendine left behind a wife, Naomi, who is Australian, and
four sons. Brisendine's neighbor of six years in Lynnwood, Wash.,
Cliff McMullen, said two of the boys are teenagers, and the other
two are younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Russ) enjoyed his family and camping with them,'' a shocked
McMullen said. ``He was just a good neighbor. If you needed a hand
or a cold beer, he was always around.''
</P>
<P>
   McMullen said the father of four went crazy decorating his house
every Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had kind of a competition going to see who could string up
the most lights,'' said McMullen.
</P>
<P>
   His work as a marine engineer sometimes took him offshore to
repair ships, McMullen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He enjoyed what he did,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shipwright Don Gomes said Brisendine and Giles, who was known as
``Little Pete,'' were well-respected and warm-hearted. He said
Brisendene was often generous in giving work to casual laborers and
was admired for his skills in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just great people to work for,'' he said. ``This is
like a little family. Everyone here are fishermen or ex-fishermen.
I can't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Kelly said when Giles was just 12-years-old, he spent
his first summer working on family-owned ``tender'' boats that
would pick up salmon from fishermen in Alaska and ferry them to
canneries. He guessed Giles had spent about 10 summers on Alaskan
waters and said that eventually Giles got his captain's license.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a lot of experience and he was a pretty capable boat
operator,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the family has sold all but one of its boats,
the 160-foot Ariga, a king crab fishing boat that has been leased
to a California company, Kelly said. His sons instead have focused
their energy into making the shipyard repair business a success,
and Giles was an important part of that effort.
</P>
<P>
   He was remembered well by those who worked at other businesses
in the Northlake Shipyard building. Jennifer Faller, president of
Surface Technology, described him as charmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a really upbeat, energetic, smiley, wonderful, old
peach of a guy,'' Faller said. ``He would do anything for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Giles' gradfather said the quality people noticed most about
Giles was his warmth.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a young kid, he was extremely gracious and polite,'' Kelly
said. ``Almost everyone how met him would tell me, `I would love to
have a grandson like that.' And when he got dressed up, he was real
handsome. The girls really like him, though none of them had nailed
him yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Giles had an apartment on the top of Queen Anne hill, not far
from his office. Lee Henrickson, the owner of Giles' condo unit,
described the young man as a good tenant who was quiet and timely
with his rent during the approximately three years he lived there.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Miami, Henrickson said Giles
``liked to be out on the water'' and had traveled to some islands
near the Philippines in the last couple of years to snorkel.
Henrickson was dismayed that the young man was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a shocker,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Giles grandfather said that Giles' parents, George and Kathryn
Giles, will be flying in from Illinois Thursday to help plans
Giles' funeral service. He said Giles also had an older brother,
Craig, and a younger sister, Monica.

CHINESE GOVERNMENT NOT EXPECTED TO LET-UP AGAINST FOLLOWERS OF
FALUN GONG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (CHANGES ``social wound'' to ``social divisons'' in 4th graf) (rk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING, _ Has it come to this: that the Chinese Communist Party
is terrified of retirees in tennis shoes who follow a spiritual
master in New York?
</P>
<P>
   So it has almost seemed here during recent days of bizarre
arrests and flying invective against the Falun Gong movement.
</P>
<P>
   As security forces worked frantically to pick up believers who
converged on Beijing to plead Falun Gong's case, the government
left no doubt that it intends to wipe out all organized traces of
the movement _ even if that requires jailing thousands of people
who never considered themselves enemies of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Behind closed doors in recent weeks, many Chinese, from
professors to cab drivers, have said the government has
overreacted. Many say its blunt repression of a spiritual movement
that attracted hordes of ordinary people seeking health and
happiness will cause lasting social divisions and further erode
faith in the party.
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts say that even so, China's communist leaders
probably saw little choice. Their first principle is preserving the
rule of the party, which they equate with protecting social
stability. And they have consistently tried to stamp out any
competing loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Logically, they had to do this,'' said Suesheng Zhao, a
Chinese-born political scientist at Colby College in Maine who is
currently a visiting fellow at Stanford. ``For the Communist Party,
the greatest threat is a nationally organized force.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its founding in 1992, Falun Gong, a mix of cosmic healing
theories, Buddhism and Taoism that promises salvation in a corrupt
world, has gained millions of followers _ retirees, middle-aged
women and even many officials and students, who gathered regularly
in public parks to practice their mystical exercises.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the party, this was a big problem,'' said Roderick
MacFarquhar, a professor of Chinese politics and history at Harvard
University. ``The party cannot allow the existence of a rival mass
organization with control over the hearts and souls of the ordinary
people _ and exposing their own ideological vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the group was outlawed on July 22, unknown thousands of
its core believers have refused to fade away, creating an
unexpected crisis and forcing the government to mobilize all its
media and social organizations, even bosses in many work places, to
engage in ritual condemnations.
</P>
<P>
   In the months since the ban, official vilification of the group
and its elusive founder, Li Hongzhi, who moved to New York in 1998,
has grown ever more shrill _ a sign that the eradication campaign
has not gone smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, senior communist legislators described Falun Gong
as ``unprecedented in the 50-year history of the People's Republic
in terms of its size of organization, influence, number of illegal
publications as well as the damages it brought to society,'' the
New China News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   These were strong words for a group that had received little
high-level attention before it held an unauthorized vigil in
Beijing on April 25, when some 10,000 members from several
provinces quietly gathered around the leadership compound to
protest published critiques of their movement and to demand
official recognition.
</P>
<P>
   By its very existence _ and as government officials later
charged _ this gathering was the most serious challenge to
Communist Party authority since the student-led demonstrations of
1989.
</P>
<P>
   When they outlawed Falun Gong, the authorities charged that Li
and a small cabal of leaders had a secret political agenda to
subvert the nation, though no evidence was offered.
</P>
<P>
   Li, who keeps in touch with an expanding global following on the
Internet, insists he has no political aims. He has never advocated
the overthrow of Communist rule or even a more liberal policy on
religion. And his believers insist they just want to be left alone
to focus on their inner ``cultivation.''
</P>
<P>
   But the believers have also been quick to mobilize in defense of
their movement, in hundreds of smaller protests before and since
the giant April demonstration in Beijing. In China, such defiance
of authority is inevitably considered deeply political.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has retreated from many spheres of personal and
social life, the Communist Party still demands the stated
allegiance of every organization. But as is evident in their
willingness to face arrest, the more fervent followers of Falun
Gong give their supreme loyalty to Li and what they consider his
life-transforming theories.
</P>
<P>
   When it banned Falun Gong, the government brought a variety of
criminal charges against Li and arrested a number of top
organizers. Thousands more who persisted in proclaiming their faith
have since been detained or harassed in cities all around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing over the last 10 days, more than 3,000 protesters
were rounded up as soon as they were detected, officials said. Many
were bused back to their hometown police for ``re-education,''
which may mean loss of jobs or time in labor camps.
</P>
<P>
   But the police seem unable to mop up a core of believers, in
Beijing and elsewhere, who say they are prepared to risk everything
for their faith and have made smart use of e-mail, mobile phones
and pagers to communicate with each other and with supporters
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the effort to discredit and destroy Falun Gong,
using the familiar scripts of Communist dictatorship, has shifted
into high gear.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, in an effort to bolster the moral and legal case,
the party's newspaper, People's Daily, featured a front-page
commentary arguing that Falun Gong is an ``evil cult'' that any
government would have to suppress.
</P>
<P>
   The rank-and-file believers, it said, were mere dupes of Li's
``sorcery.'' Small numbers of people continue to operate under Li's
``remote control,'' it said, and are ``unable to see the
blood-soaked truth.'' Chinese authorities have blamed the group for
at least 1,400 deaths of members who refused needed medical care.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, another People's Daily editorial said, ``Like all
cults, Falun Gong is an anti-social, anti-human, anti-science and
anti-government malignant tumor.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The group does have some cultlike features, including fervent
devotion to one man's offbeat doctrines, obsessive secrecy and
often extreme reactions to criticism. Master Li, as followers refer
to him, has been caught dissembling about aspects of his
background, about his presence in Beijing just before the April
demonstration and about some of his wilder claims of supernatural
powers, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   But the government offered no convincing evidence for its
comparisons of Falun Gong to the Jim Jones cult, whose members
committed mass suicide, and the Branch Davidians, who died while
under FBI attack in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese who sampled Falun Gong in recent years, usually to see
if it would improve their health and spirits, say that beyond the
purchase of books, they were never asked to hand over large sums of
money to the group. While differing loyalties to Falun Gong
sometimes caused bitter divisions within families, followers were
not asked to cut all normal social bonds. Nor, in contrast to the
more notorious cults, was it difficult to leave the group.
</P>
<P>
   The reported deaths of believers who refused medical treatment
pose a far more complex issue than the official victim counts would
have it, especially in a country where many people believe that
cosmic forces influence health and rely on traditional treatments
not always supported by modern medicine.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday the national Parliament, laying one of the final
planks for coming show trials, adopted a stringent anticult law
that was tailored expressly for prosecution of Falun Gong leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, in a step being strangely touted as progress
toward the ``rule of law,'' prosecutors charged four reported
ringleaders with major crimes under that new law _ for actions
supposedly taken months before it was adopted.
</P>
<P>
   In China's long history of authoritarian government, the danger
to rulers from emerging national organizations has been repeatedly
demonstrated, said Zhao, the political scientist.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson was not lost on Mao Tse-tung, Zhao noted. During his
Cultural Revolution of 1966-1976, for example, Mao sent in army
troops to disperse the Red Guards he had created as soon as local
groups began to coalesce into broader entities. Mao had brutally
crushed a religious sect in the 1950s, undoubtedly mindful of how
mystical movements like the Taiping rebels and the Boxers disrupted
the country in imperial times.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with rising unemployment, anger over official corruption
and a slowdown in economic growth, the government feels insecure
and vulnerable, many experts say. The authorities also worry about
the long-term effect of new communications technologies _
skillfully wielded by Falun Gong and democracy advocates _ on the
party's ability to monopolize power and public discourse.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders are only beginning to hint in public about the
possible extent of their Falun Gong problem. Until this week,
official statements about the crackdown stressed that while a small
number of top leaders would be harshly punished, other adherents
would simply need education about how they had been duped.
</P>
<P>
   But an article Monday in People's Daily described for the first
time the likelihood of ``long-term resistance.'' Beyond the top
leaders, it said, ``second and third tiers'' of leaders have been
created.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a few areas, illegal meetings are still being held,'' the
article said, the only clue for Chinese readers of the continuing
subterranean struggle.

   GENEVA, Switzerland _ Iraq's foreign minister said Wednesday
that his government would reject any U.N. move to suspend economic
sanctions in return for Iraq's cooperation with a new
weapons-monitoring program.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are saying they might suspend sanctions but Iraq has to
accept a long list of new conditions,'' the minister, Muhammad Said
al-Sahaf, told reporters. ``No Iraqi would accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq insists that sanctions be completely lifted, not suspended,
Sahaf said. France, Russia and China have submitted a draft
resolution to the U.N. Security Council calling for the suspension
of sanctions if Iraq accepts a new commission to monitor its
weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Security Council resolutions ``say clearly that
sanctions are to be lifted,'' he said. ``Now they want to rewrite
the resolutions for their own purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   He also denied that Iraq had any forbidden weapons, declaring
that it had met its obligations under U.N. resolutions that call
for eliminating biological, chemical and nuclear weapons. ``Nothing
in Iraq has anything to do with prohibited weapons,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-member Security Council is trying to decide how Iraq must
account for its weapons of mass destruction to secure the end of
the sanctions imposed on the country after Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait in January 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Intensive negotiations have been going on among the five
permanent Security Council members _ the United States, Britain,
Russia, France and China _ on whether to reconstitute an
arms-inspection commission as a step towards easing sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. inspection program in Iraq was suspended last December.
A short time later, the United States and Britain began a bombing
campaign against Iraq for its refusal to cooperate with
international inspectors. ``The monitoring system was there since
1994,'' Sahaf said. ``Then they came and bombarded it. They
destroyed the system they built.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain had also been pressing for the
dismissal of the U.N. relief coordinator in Iraq, Hans von Sponeck
of Germany, although Secretary-General Kofi Annan decided this week
to reappoint him.
</P>
<P>
   They have criticized Sponeck, who oversees programs that allow
Iraq to sell oil to buy food and medicine as exceptions to the
sanctions, on grounds that he has allowed Iraqi officials to
stockpile these goods.

EFFECT OF GENETICALLY ALTERED CORN ON BUTTERFLIES IS DEBATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<P>
   ROSEMONT, Ill. _ An unusual scientific symposium organized and
financed by a biotech trade group ended Tuesday with conflicting
assertions about the risks that genetically engineered corn might
pose to the monarch butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   Makers of the genetically altered corn were put on the defensive
in May when a study by Cornell researchers was published in the
journal Nature showing that pollen from corn producing the
insecticidal toxin Bt could kill monarch caterpillars in the
laboratory. Since then the potential threat to the monarch has
become a focus for the growing opposition to genetically engineered
crops by environmental and other groups.
</P>
<P>
   After the study, the biotech industry sponsored further research
on the issue, including some presented at the meeting here. The
Agricultural Biotechnology Stewardship Working Group, the industry
group that organized the symposium, issued a statement Wednesday
morning saying scientists were expected to conclude that the
altered corn pollen did not harm the monarch.
</P>
<P>
   But far from culminating in a consensus, the day was marked by
sometimes heated exchange and ended with some scientists concluding
that the bioengineered corn was safer than had been feared while
others said it was premature to drawn any such conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we will all be a little patient, and allow good science
to work its way to good data and good discussions,'' said Dr.
Adrianna Hewings, who represented the Department of Agriculture at
the meeting, in a concluding statement.
</P>
<P>
   The department is the primary federal regulator of genetically
engineered crops.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the researchers emphasized that their results were
preliminary, with many studies still far from complete. Some
presented data suggesting that pollen from different varieties
differ in their toxicity, with one genetic variety of corn known as
176 posing a much greater threat than other more common varieties.
In addition, researchers presented evidence that suggests that Bt
corn pollen might not travel as far away from fields as had been
feared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst-case scenario is not true,'' said Dr. Stuart Weiss,
a researcher at Stanford University. Dr. Richard Hellmich, a
research entomologist at Iowa State University, was among the most
positive about the safety of the corn. He said that ``research
today had no bias to it'' and that ``there was a lot of information
presented that was positive about Bt corn.''
</P>
<P>
   But others noted that data presented showed that within and
nearby cornfields, plants like milkweed, which monarch caterpillars
eat, do get a heavy dusting of toxin-producing pollen. What remains
unknown, researchers agreed, was where monarchs were really coming
from and what proportion were likely to be growing up on plants
with harmful amounts of pollen.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers expressed concern that so many studies, still
far from completion and none peer-reviewed or published, should be
given such a public airing, in particular in a forum orchestrated
by the industry whose products safety has been brought into
question. The industry group sponsoring the event includes Monsanto
Co., Novartis AG of Switzerland, Pioneer Hi-Bred, which is owned by
DuPont Co., and other makers of genetically engineered seed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it was dirty pool and the fox was guarding the chicken
coop,'' said Dr. Lincoln Brower, a monarch expert at Sweet Briar
College in Virginia. ``It was not conclusive.''

   SEATTLE _ A gunman dressed in camouflage, sunglasses and a brown
hat opened fire Wednesday morning at a shipyard building near Lake
Union here, killing two people and wounding two others, police
said. The man then fled, sparking a huge manhunt through north
Seattle during which police advised residents to stay in their
homes and kept children at 20 schools locked inside their
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The dragnet, with helicopters and police dogs, continued into
the evening. Police said they had no identification of the suspect
and no idea of his motive. Employees at the Northlake Shipyard
shop, where the shooting occurred shortly after 10:30 a.m., said
the man did not work there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He walked in and started shooting,'' said Pam McCammon, a
police spokeswoman. ``That's all we know.''
</P>
<P>
   The victims, both men, were not identified as of Wednesday
evening. A spokesman at Harborview Medical Center said that two
other victims were in the hospital, a 58-year-old-man with critical
injuries and a 19-year-old man listed in stable condition.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings, which occurred one day after seven people were
shot to death in a Xerox Corp. office in Honolulu, were covered
extensively on Seattle local television, with some footage shot
from news helicopters overhead. But, sensitive to possible
criticism, local stations insisted they had followed guidelines to
insure that their accounts were not giving the killer, in case he
was watching, information about exactly where and how the police
search was being conducted.  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   American Home Products Corp. and Warner-Lambert Co. are expected
on Thursday to announce a merger that would form the world's
largest drug company, people close to the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, valued at about $70 billion, would combine some of the
world's best known brands, including Warner-Lambert's Listerine
mouthwash and American Home Products' Advil painkiller, and two New
Jersey-based companies based less than 10 miles of each other.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, to be known as AmericanWarner, would be based
in Madison, N.J., the headquarters of American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
   The boards of both companies were meeting last night and were
expected to approve the deal. As in any merger negotiations, until
the boards approve the deal a transaction could fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   If a deal is consummated, the company would be a combination of
equals. Investors in both companies would trade in their stock for
shares in AmericanWarner, which would be divided evenly between
American Home and Warner-Lambert. The companies would each get 10
members on AmericanWarner's 20-member board, according to people
close to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   AHP had announced two huge mergers last year _ first with the
British drug maker SmithKline Beecham PLC and later with Monsanto
Co. _ that subsequently fell apart, primarily over who would run
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at AHP and Warner-Lambert have been talking about a
combination for several months, said one person close to the
companies. It is believed that AHP had approached Warner-Lambert as
early as last year, but the company was not eager to merge until
Warner-Lambert chairman Lodewijk . de Vink took over in January.
</P>
<P>
   Executive egos are unlikely to derail this deal, however. People
close to the negotiations said Wednesday that John Stafford, the
62-year-old chairman and chief executive of American Home Products,
would become chairman of AmericanWarner, but only for 18 months. He
would then be succeeded by de Vink, who would serve as the chief
executive of AmericanWarner. He is 54 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Stafford has strong opinions as to how the executive office
should be structured. One person close to the talks said that
Stafford had insisted that AmericanWarner have no mandatory
retirement age for its chairman or chief executive, a policy that
is in place now at American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
   An AHP spokesman declined to comment on the management
structure.
</P>
<P>
   The birth of AmericanWarner might be the beginning of the next
set of large mergers in the drug industry. The company, which would
have $23.7 billion in total sales, would have an enormous presence
in consumer brands and agricultural products as well as
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Wednesday that they still expect AHP ome to
continue its plan to sell its troubled agricultural division,
allowing the new company to concentrate on its core prescription
drug business.
</P>
<P>
   With $13.8 billion in worldwide prescription sales,
AmericanWarner would be the biggest concern in its industry. Its
nearest competitors _ Novartis, Astra/Zeneca and Merck _ each have
about $11 billion in worldwide sales in an industry so fragmented
that its leaders have single digit shares of the market, according
to IMS Health, an industry consultant.
</P>
<P>
   After the merger, AmericanWarner would have 5.5 percent of the
world prescription drug market, compared with Astra/Zeneca's 4.2
percent, IMS said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts insist that AmericanWarner's size would be an
advantage. The combined company's research and development expenses
last year totaled $2.5 billion, compared with just $877 million at
Warner-Lambert. By comparison, Merck spent $1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unlikely that there will be any significant antitrust
issues with the merger,'' said Viren Mehta, a partner at Mehta
Partners. ``There is very little obvious overlap in the products
the two companies make. The only noticeable problem is the sizable
gap that would exist between the world's top drug maker and its
nearest competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Wednesday that they were surprised at how quickly
American Home Products has moved to correct its ill fortunes. Aside
from AHP's two ill-fated mergers, the company had several product
calamities, including a $54 million settlement over its Norplant
contraception device and a $3.75 billion payout to settle claims
over the fen-phen diet pill combination.
</P>
<P>
   The product disasters had caused shares of American Home
Products to tumble 45 percent from its 52-week high of $70.25 on
April 13 to $38.50 on Sept. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Wednesday that AHP executives feared that the
company could become prey to hostile competitors, notably Novartis,
which has a sizable agricultural and consumer division, or
Glaxo-Wellcome, a company analysts believe to be actively looking
for a deal.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted giddily to the possibility of an all-American
merger. Shares of American Home Products jumped 11 percent, or
$5.625 Wednesday, to $56. Warner-Lambert's stock jumped $5.625, to
$83.8125.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts believe the merger, which was reported Wednesday
in The Wall Street Journal, is necessary. In the last few years,
the pharmaceutical industry has become so competitive that
companies can ill afford to not have blockbuster drugs on pharmacy
shelves or be boasting about others in their pipelines.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even though Warner-Lambert had been one of the drug industry's
hottest performers _ routinely reporting quarterly earnings gains
of more than 30 percent _ analysts were concerned that its pipeline
lacked the depth of some of its competitors.

 UNDATED: its competitors.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AmericanWarner would have a strong presence in several drug
categories. Sales of Lipitor, Warner-Lambert's cholesterol
reduction drug, should near $5 billion next year, according to
analysts, while American Home Products' Effexor antidepressant line
and Premarin hormone replacement are projected to each top $1
billion in sales in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, we like the deal between American Home Products and
Warner-Lambert,'' said Neil Sweig, an analyst with Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co.
``But it's not a done deal by any means. But it has some positives.
Warner-Lambert is not so dependent on Lipitor and American Home has
a good drug pipeline.''
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have potential top selling drugs under
development. AHP is developing two vaccines _ one for flu and one
for pediatric pneumonia _ that analysts project to notch sales of
more than $250 million. Warner-Lambert is developing a treatment
for neuropathic pain that could sell more than $600 million. All
three drugs are expected to be released within the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a bounty of new products, the merger is expected to
create $1 billion in synergies, according to people close to the
negotiations. One target may be the two companies' home operations,
which employ some 6,700 people in New Jersey alone. Analysts could
not project how many jobs could be eliminated, although some
duplication could result in virtually all of the new company's
prime businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Even though some analysts were cautious that the deal could be
scrapped, others believed it would succeed by how well the two
companies' chief executives appeared to be getting along. Stafford
has a reputation for being one of the industry's most aggressive
bosses, to the point of throwing the occasional elbow on the
company basketball court, according to one of his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   But de Vink, while confident, does not need to be in the
limelight, analysts said, making him the perfect executive office
companion to Stafford.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be hard for an outside company to break this
deal up,'' Mehta said. ``Few management teams fit as neatly
together as this one.''  &QL;

A CREW'S ACCOUNT: ALONE AT SEA, WHEN A TERRIBLE ROAR SHOOK THE
NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ Far offshore, in waters shrouded by darkness and
a light haze, the crew of the fishing vessel Hedy Brenna worked
through the night last Saturday and into Sunday morning, hauling
lobster pots from the deep water south of Nantucket. The seas were
nearly flat calm. The air was unseasonably warm. A routine trip had
just begun.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly before 2 a.m., the vessel's captain, Christopher D.
Lutyens, slipped the engine into idle to let his deckhands clear a
snarled line. With almost no breeze and the boat's engine purring,
he heard a noise different from anything he had ever heard on the
sea: a terrible roaring off the starboard side, oddly close to the
water, and metallic. A bit like the peal and rumble of thunder, he
said, but not quite.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an immense crash,'' Lutyens said Wednesday, standing in
the wheelhouse after his crew lashed the vessel to a state pier and
concluded a five-day trip. ``It sounded like aluminum hitting the
water, and tearing apart.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hedy Brenna, a 77-foot steel lobster boat that roams the
offshore fishing grounds of southern New England, is believed to
have been the vessel nearest to EgyptAir Flight 990 as it slammed
into the sea 33 minutes after departing Kennedy International
Airport en route to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   News that the vessel had been in the area of the crash had
circulated on Rhode Island's fishing ports for days, and Wednesday,
two agents from the FBI interviewed Lutyens and his crew just hours
after the Hedy Brenna slipped into the harbor and left the
wind-whipped seas behind. The FBI's face-to-face interviews
followed a preliminary inquiry by an agent who called the vessel by
radio.
</P>
<P>
   The agents met with the crew for roughly an hour, questioning
them one by one in the wheelhouse in the presence of Lutyens and
the vessel's owner, Paul Bennett, who was not aboard during the
trip. Three of the five deckhands said they had heard the noise.
Two others, who were on the port side of the vessel when the others
heard the strange sound, said they had heard nothing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In interviews after the agents departed the pier, Lutyens, 39,
and his first mate, Max Unger, 31, gave an account of their time at
sea, a trip that started in balmy weather, was punctuated by the
crash, and ended with rough water and waiting FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   They left Saturday and steamed to an offshore area where they
had suspended groups of 50 pots, called trawls, below the water.
The gear they checked early Sunday is in an area known as the
Nantucket Lightship closed area, a traditional cod, flounder and
lobster ground that, for conservation reasons, has been closed to
most cod and flounder fishing in recent years, leaving prime areas
for lobster fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the crash, Lutyens and Unger said, they were
tending gear roughly five miles east-northeast of the initial
debris field that the Kings Pointer, a training vessel from the
U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, would find hours later.
</P>
<P>
   A line had become tangled, Lutyens idled the engine, and then
they heard the noise, he said. Because of the darkness and a light
surface haze, the men said the visibility was limited to two to
three miles and they saw no sign of the airplane's descent, crash
or debris. ``No flares, no fireballs, no explosion _ nothing,''
Lutyens said.
</P>
<P>
   What did penetrate the mist, he said, was a rumble that lasted
for two or three seconds, distinctly off the vessel's starboard
side and apparently at water level. Then there was silence. The men
kept at their work. Later in the morning, after the Hedy Brenna had
traveled out of the area, details of the crash came to them over
the vessel's marine-band radio.
</P>
<P>
   Only then did they realize what they had heard. The men
emphasized that the noise appeared to come from the horizon, not
from up in the air, and that they had heard nothing else: no
explosions, jet engines or sonic booms. On Tuesday, investigators
said the EgyptAir jet plunged from the sky so quickly, it reached a
supersonic speed before it hit the water.
</P>
<P>
   Lutyens said he hears sonic booms as often as twice each day
when Concorde supersonic jets pass over the lobster grounds on
their trans-Atlantic flights, and this noise was much different.
``A sonic boom is like something that goes `kapow!' and shakes the
boat,'' he said. ``It wasn't like that.''
</P>
<P>
   And Unger, who has also heard many sonic booms before, said the
noise lacked a sonic boom's sharp echo. ``I've never heard anything
like it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lutyens said he believed that the rumbling was the impact of the
Boeing 767 as it struck the ocean surface, and perhaps broke apart.
``If the plane blew up at 33,000 feet, I didn't hear it,'' he said.
``But I don't think that's what happened. I think it hit the
water.'' &QL;

   U.S. ACCUSES SEVEN UTILITIES OF VIOLATING CLEAN-AIR LAW
</P>
<P>
   The federal government sued seven electric companies in the
Midwest and South, accusing the utilities of defying anti-pollution
regulations and illegally contaminating the air breathed by
millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants are American Electric Power, Cinergy,
FirstEnergy, Illinois Power, Southern Indiana Gas and Electric,
Southern and Tampa Electric. The government accused them of
modernizing their generating plants without modernizing their
pollution controls as required by the Clean Air Act.

</P>
<P>
   TYCO TO SHIFT ACQUISITION STRATEGY
</P>
<P>
   Tyco International, whose share price has declined in recent
weeks over concern about its accounting practices, said that it was

   Prime Minister Jean Chretien named Beverley McLachlin as the
first woman to be chief justice of the Supreme Court. Ms.
McLachlin, who has served on the court for a decade, has been
called an egalitarian jurist and a radical feminist. In a September
decision, Ms. McLachlin wrote that an aerobics test that led to the
firing of a woman as a firefighter was discriminatory. In a July
decision she barred a boy from suing his mother for prenatal
injuries. The conservative Canada Family Action Coalition,
denounced the appointment, calling her ``a radical feminist.''

GALLAHER OF BRITAIN CONSIDERS BID FOR FRENCH TOBACCO RIVAL
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The British cigarette maker Gallaher Group may scuttle
the proposed merger between tobacco makers Tabacalera of Spain and
Seita of France by making its own bid for Seita.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gallaher confirmed Wednesday night that the
company had approached Seita this week about a possible bid, though
no decision to make a formal offer had been made. Word of the offer
was reported in the French newspaper Le Figaro.
</P>
<P>
   Gallaher, which manufactures Silk Cuts and Benson &AMP; Hedges, said
it had informally offered 75 euros a share, valuing the French
tobacco concern at 3.9 billion euros, or $4.1 billion, a 26.5
percent premium over Seita's valuation of 59.28 euros a share when
it announced plans to merge with Tabacalera last month.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Gallaher confirmed the details of its informal
offer after not commenting all day. The statement said the approach
did not represent a firm offer by Gallaher for Seita shares.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that if Gallaher acquired Seita, it would finally
make the British company competitive with bigger rivals like
Phillip Morris and R.J. Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bold move,'' said Jonathan Fell, an analyst at Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Company in London. ``It would definitely add the
international business that they've been lacking.''
</P>
<P>
   The report in Le Figaro sent shares of Gallaher, Seita and
Tabacalera up on investor optimism that a bidding fight would
follow. Shares of Seita rose the most, up 9.9 percent to 56 euros,
or about $58.91, in Paris, gaining the largest percentage among
European blue-chip stocks. Shares of Gallaher rose 0.54 percent, to
372 pence, or about $6.10, in London. While investors remained
anxious about Tabacalera's ability to cope alone, if the deal
between it and Seita collapsed, its shares still increased 0.45
percent, to 15.79 euros, or about $16.61, in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   One question that analysts raised was whether Gallaher would be
able to create any substantial savings from an acquisition of
Seita.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the tremendous synergies from this deal,'' Fell
said. ``But I didn't see many from the other deal either.''
</P>
<P>
   While a deal might not result in cost savings, analysts said a
merger of the companies would help them expand abroad at a time
when they are losing market share at home.
</P>
<P>
   And a combined company of Gallaher and Seita would have a market
value worth about $1 billion more than combined Seita and
Tabacalera. Analysts pointed out that investors did not respond
positively to the Seita and Tabacalera merger plan, sending the
value of the combined concern down about $520 million since the
deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Seita and Tabacalera declined to comment on the
Gallaher offer. Both the French and Spanish governments had
supported their merger plans. Analysts said they thought Gallaher
and Seita would also gain backing from the British and French
governments if a deal moved ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, though, the news of Gallaher's acquisition plan was ill
timed for the British company because it is likely to raise the
cost of any deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fairly obvious that Gallaher didn't want this to come
out,'' Fell said. ``It's a bit messy.''

TIGHT GOVERNOR'S RACE WILL BE DECIDED BY MISSISSIPPI HOUSE
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Miss., Va., Pa., Ky., Ala., S.C., Ohio, Ind.)  (With INITIATIVES-ELECT) 
(nk) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 740,000 people went to the polls in Mississippi on
Tuesday to choose a new governor. But it appears the race will be
decided by the 122 members of the state's House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   That is because neither candidate ended up with more than half
the vote, barring a recount or absentee ballots tipping the balance
over the next several days. And, under Mississippi law, such
outcomes are decided by the House.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-to-1 in the state House. So if
the decision is left to that body, in all likelihood the next
governor of Mississippi will be the Democratic candidate, Lt. Gov.
Ronnie Musgrove.
</P>
<P>
   With 100 percent of precincts reporting, Musgrove had 49.5
percent of the vote, his Republican opponent, Mike Parker, a former
congressman, had 48.6 percent, and the rest was split between two
little-known candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the state's closest governor's race, certainly in the
20th century, and I think forever,'' said Eric Clark, the
Mississippi secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the race was so close was that the two candidates
held almost identical views on the issues, especially on how to
improve Mississippi's schools and economy. Both also played up
family values, a hot issue in a conservative, Bible-belt state
whose incumbent governor, Kirk Fordice, has had very public marital
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Under Mississippi law, a winning candidate for a state office
must have 50 percent of the vote, plus one more vote. Until now,
there has never been any reason to resort to the law to decide a
governor's contest.
</P>
<P>
   Should Musgrove end up the winner, his victory will do more than
return control of the office to the Democrats after eight years in
Republicans hands, the only period of Republican control in the
past 125 years. A Musgrove victory also would be a significant
addition to an already impressive string of victories around the
country by Democrats in Tuesday's off-year balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans had some signal victories too, most notably
capturing control of the Virginia Legislature for the first time.
But the Democrats had the most victories, though not enough, in the
opinion of many political analysts, to draw any reliable indication
about what might be in store for the major parties in 2000
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats took over the mayors' offices in Indianapolis and in
Columbus, Ohio, putting together inner city multiracial coalitions
to end almost 30 years of Republican control in each city. At the
same time, Democrats also narrowly beat back a determined
Republican challenge in the mayor's race in Philadelphia and they
easily brushed aside Republican efforts to capture the mayors'
offices in Baltimore and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the Democratic incumbent in the Kentucky governor's
race, Paul Patton, readily won re-election.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton called Tuesday's results a big win for his
party and characterized the Mississippi race as ``truly historic.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Andrew, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee,
proclaimed that ``the Democratic Party is on the move'' and saw the
victories in Indianapolis and Columbus as encouraging
demonstrations of resurging Democratic strength in urban America,
especially in the industrial Midwest, which could be a major
battleground in Election 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, the chairman of the Republican National
Committee, chose to focus on his party's win in Virginia, calling
it ``a bellwether for all the elections which are going to be held
all over America next year.'' He also found victory in the narrow
Republican defeat in heavily Democratic Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   More dispassionate observers of national politics tended to take
less definitive views of Tuesday's results.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Hess, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in
Washington, said that ``you really can't make an awful lot out of
an election like this.''
</P>
<P>
   And Earl Black, a political scientist at Rice University, said
that ``no party goes into 2000 with a clear, comprehensive national
victory from these off-year elections'' because of their
``obviously mixed results.''
</P>
<P>
   Both national parties poured big money into the Virginia and
Mississippi contests.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in Virginia, from a national standpoint, was which
party would be in control of the legislature in 2001, when
congressional district lines will be redrawn around the country.
That process ultimately could help determine which party controls
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in Mississippi, from a national standpoint, was whether
Democrats could keep a victory roll going in Deep South governors'
races, having stemmed a long Republican roll by winning last year
in Alabama and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But outside help in the Mississippi race was not limited to
outside money. In the case of the Democrats, the Rev. Jesse Jackson
also provided some help, bringing in volunteers to help register
black voters in the Delta, a region that reported a particularly
heavy turnout on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The black vote also played an important role in the mayor's
elections in Indianapolis, Columbus and Philadelphia. In
Indianapolis and Columbus, where black voting power has expanded as
more and more whites have moved to the suburbs, blacks teamed with
working-class whites and gave the Democratic Party the edge it had
previously lacked to take over the mayor's office.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, many black voters took the politically rare
step of going over to the Republican side, drawn by a candidate
willing to address their issues. In the end, however, not quite
enough jumped across to provide a victory, especially after worried
Democratic leaders persuaded Clinton to come in for a rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Tuesday's voting in Mississippi and the Midwest and
elsewhere ultimately tells us,'' said Jackson, ``is that blacks and
whites increasing are voting shared economic interests and not just
racial issues. That's an important new pattern.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In what federal officials called one of the biggest
enforcement actions in the nation's history, the federal government
sued seven giant electric companies in the Midwest and the South on
Wednesday, accusing the utilities of defying anti-pollution
regulations and illegally contaminating the air breathed by
millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The government took action against 32 coal-fired plants in 10
states, saying that if the plants reduced pollution as required it
would have the same effect as taking 26 million cars off the road.
</P>
<P>
   The government accused the companies of modernizing their
generating plants without modernizing their pollution controls as
required by the Clean Air Act, which exempts many old power plants
from the law's toughest requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department filed the lawsuits on behalf of the
Environmental Protection Agency. The government contends that 17
power plants run by the companies have fouled the atmosphere for
years and have contributed ``to some of the most severe
environmental problems facing the United States today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When children have trouble breathing because of pollution from
a utility plant hundreds of miles away, something must be done,''
Attorney General Janet Reno said. The civil suits, which seek to
fine the companies and force them to install modern anti-pollution
equipment, were filed in U.S District Court in five Midwestern and
Southern cities.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA administrator, Carol Browner, said the seven defendants
had committed ``very, very significant violations of the Clean Air
Act,'' an accusation that the utilities immediately denounced.
</P>
<P>
   Browner said the companies had illegally retooled old,
pollution-spewing coal plants without notifying regulators, getting
the necessary permits and installing expensive new equipment to
reduce emissions and meet pollution standards that apply to new
plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They chose not to,'' Browner said, ``because they knew that if
they did they'd have to reduce their pollution, and they didn't
want to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The utilities' motive, she added, was to prolong the lives of
the old plants and to avoid the cost of building new plants because
of the tough, modern standards.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants denounced the government's action. ``We regret
that the agency has again demonstrated that it prefers headlines
and confrontation over consensus-building,'' said Dale Heydlauff, a
vice president of American Electric Power of Columbus, Ohio. ``We
are fully prepared to vigorously defend against these allegations,
and we believe we will prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the lawsuits, the government took administrative
action against the Tennessee Valley Authority, accusing the agency
of similar violations at seven of its plants. And it issued
violation notices _ possible precursors to additional suits _
accusing the seven electric utilities of pollution violations at
eight other plants.
</P>
<P>
   The government's actions Wednesday are the latest volley in a
long-running battle over the air pollution that starts in the
Midwest and drifts on the wind toward the highly polluted New York
region and on to New England. Northeastern states and the federal
government have argued that unless new controls are imposed in the
Midwest, the chronic air pollution problems of the Northeast can
never be cured. But they have met mixed success in their efforts to
solve the problem with new air pollution regulations, which always
end up being challenged in court.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits brought immediate praise from environmental groups.
``This is a major and much-needed enforcement action,'' said Frank
O'Donnell, executive director of the Clean Air Trust, in a typical
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever side prevails, it was clear Wednesday that a
fundamental dispute is over definitions _ most importantly, the
difference between major renovations and ``routine maintenance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clean Air Act of 1970 sets strict standards for new
pollution sources, in this instance power plants, and much looser
ones for older sources. The older sources are ``grandfathered,''
meaning that they can continue to operate with relatively minor
improvements as long as their owners do not undertake major
renovations, in which case the plants are supposed to come under
the strict new standards.
</P>
<P>
   Browner said about 100 EPA investigators working over the last
two years had uncovered many instances in which the utilities had
embarked on big capital improvements, then tried to pass them off
as routine maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one plant they spent $60 million for five new furnaces,''
Browner said. ``That's hardly routine maintenance.''
</P>
<P>
   Or is it? Lawyers for the utilities are likely to argue that
spending millions of dollars to improve a decades-old plant could
be construed as ``routine maintenance,'' especially if the
alternative is to spend hundreds of millions on a new plant.
</P>
<P>
   Peter H. Lehner, chief of the New York Attorney General's
Environmental Protection Bureau, said both sides would recruit
experts to argue points like that. ``If it's routine maintenance,
we lose,'' he said. ``If it's not, they lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York attorney general's office has been preparing
similar lawsuits against some of the same defendants named in the
federal suits lodged Wednesday, and Lehner said his office would
work closely with lawyers in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki of New York welcomed the action by the
Environmental Protection Agency. ``I hope this is only the first
step by the EPA to hold these power plants accountable and give New
Yorkers the protection we need and deserve from pollution
originating in the Midwest and Southeast,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides American Electric Power, the defendants in the federal
suits are Cinergy of Cincinnati; FirstEnergy of Akron, Ohio;
Illinois Power; Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Co.; Southern
Company, based in Atlanta, and the Tampa Electric Co. of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The 32 target plants are in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,
Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Ohio, Tennessee and West Virginia.
Ms. Browner said she expected more plants to be cited, either in
suits or citations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigation is ongoing,'' she said.

   Ms. Reno and Ms. Browner said the government could seek fines
amounting to millions of dollars _ $27,500 for each day in
violation after Jan. 30, 1997, and $25,000 for each day in
violation before that under the Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Browner said extracting fines was not her agency's main
goal. ``Our first order of business _ we just want to be very clear
about this _ we want the pollution out of the air,'' she said.
Lawyers familiar with the litigation predicted that some parts of
the suit might be settled.
</P>
<P>
   The federal officials and environmentalists said the pollution
involved _ blends of sulfur and nitrogen and old-fashioned soot _
strip leaves from trees, foul lakes and stain old copper statues.
Far more important, they said, the pollution makes it harder for
people to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   And while the west-to-east flow of air pollution on the
prevailing winds can create the impression that pollution is a
problem foisted upon the East by people in the West, that is not
altogether true, environmentalists have long argued. The Clean Air
Task Force said in a statement Wednesday that Midwesterners are
more susceptible to pollution-related ailments than
Northeasterners.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Browner asserted that the utilities sued Wednesday could
effect proper anti-pollution controls by spending $3 million or $4
million a year _ relatively small change when compared to the $100
million or more generated by some of their power plants. Therefore,
she said, rates for consumers would rise only slightly.
</P>
<P>
   That assertion is likely to be disputed as the cases move
through the courts. Another issue will be if the utilities are
doing their best to safeguard the environment.
</P>
<P>
   One defendant, FirstEnergy, said it was. ``As a company that has
spent more than $4.25 billion on environmental protection, we take
our environmental responsibilities very seriously,'' the company
said in a statement Wednesday.

U.S. CITES CRIMINALS' RAIDS ON MEDICARE AND MEDICAID
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.C., Ill., N.J., Maine, Calif.)   (Exclusive) 
(rk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Organized criminal groups have infiltrated Medicare
and Medicaid, and they are skimming hundreds of millions of dollars
a year from the programs, federal investigators said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a new report to Congress, the General Accounting Office said
the criminal groups had formed scores of ``medical entities'' _
clinics, physician groups, diagnostic laboratories and medical
equipment suppliers _ for the purpose of bilking Medicare and
Medicaid, the insurance programs for people who are elderly,
disabled or poor.
</P>
<P>
   The companies, many of which ``existed only on paper,'' billed
the government for services and equipment that was not provided or
not medically necessary, the report said. In some cases,
beneficiaries had died before the dates on which the services were
supposedly provided.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators looked at what they said were 160 sham
companies in Florida, North Carolina and Illinois, and they visited
New Jersey as well, but they suspect the problem is nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Criminals previously involved in other types of crime are now
migrating into the health care fraud arena,'' the General
Accounting Office said in a report to Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine,
who requested the study as chairwoman of the Permanent Subcommittee
on Investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Under one type of scheme described by the General Accounting
Office, criminals paid people to recruit Medicare beneficiaries,
who were sent to clinics and offices for unnecessary medical tests
or services. The ``recruiters'' received a fee _ $100 to $135 _ for
each patient they found, and they shared the fees with cooperating
beneficiaries. Medicare was billed for services and equipment never
provided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Licensed physicians sometimes participated in such schemes,
typically exchanging their signatures on medical records for cash,
without actually performing or overseeing any medical services,''
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Under another type of scheme, the accounting office said,
members of criminal groups ``rented private mailboxes, set up bogus
corporations and opened phony corporate bank accounts.'' Payments
from Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance companies were sent
to the mailboxes, deposited in bank accounts and quickly converted
to cash or moved to other accounts beyond the reach of
law-enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, John Krayniak, deputy attorney
general of New Jersey, said: ``The face of Medicaid fraud has
changed dramatically. Ten years ago we were generally faced with an
individual doctor or pharmacist billing for services not rendered.
In the last couple of years, we've seen an influx of organized
criminal groups who exist solely to defraud Medicaid and Medicare,
frequently jumping from program to program.''
</P>
<P>
   A Monmouth County man was recently sentenced to 10 years in
prison after he pleaded guilty in a scheme to bilk New Jersey's
Medicaid program of more than $5 million. The defendant, Mohammad
A. Javid, managed a medical laboratory that paid kickbacks to the
owners of clinics in Paterson, Newark and Jersey City. The clinics
hired ``blood brokers'' to recruit people willing to give blood
samples. The labs performed expensive tests on each specimen, and
Medicaid reimbursed the labs.
</P>
<P>
   In return for their blood samples, Krayniak said, those
recruited, many of them drug addicts, received prescriptions from
doctors who worked at the clinics. Medicaid paid for the drugs,
which the patients then sold on the street or to pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office had no estimate of total losses to
the federal government. But the magnitude of the problem is
suggested by the fact that a criminal group in one Florida case
filed fraudulent Medicare claims worth more than $120 million and
$1.5 million in fraudulent Medicaid claims.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office said that ``organized criminal
groups tend to be quite transient,'' and should not be confused
with traditional organized crime groups like the Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   In one case, it said, suspects fled from New Jersey to
California and started new operations on the West Coast before they
could be arrested for violations that had occurred in New Jersey.
In other cases, it said, New Jersey shut several clinics, but later
found that ``the New York Medicaid fraud control unit was
investigating the same individuals for different schemes.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Collins said the findings of the study were
``very troubling.'' She said that she and Sen &UR; .  &LR; Richard J. Durbin,
D-Ill., were drafting legislation that would require federal
officials to conduct criminal background checks on health care
providers before allowing them to participate in Medicare. The
bill, she said, would also toughen penalties for people who buy or
sell the names and identification numbers of doctors or patients
with an intent to defraud the government.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office said criminals often used the
names of unsuspecting patients and doctors on the claims they filed
with Medicare and Medicaid. The information on beneficiaries is
``sometimes stolen from hospitals, taken from trash bins or
obtained by computer hackers,'' while the names and identification
numbers of doctors are obtained from ``unscrupulous hospital
employees,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   (STORT CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Criminal groups often launder money through foreign countries,
the accounting office said. For example, it said, the leader of a
North Carolina group filed fraudulent claims with Medicare and sent
the reimbursement checks, by Federal Express, to friends and
relatives in Mexico, where they were cashed or converted to
traveler's checks. Some of the money was spent on jewelry, which
was shipped to the United States and sold by the group leader from
his home.
</P>
<P>
   In another Medicare case described by the General Accounting
Office, the leader of a criminal group in Florida instructed his
wife to send $4.5 million overseas, and ``the money was then
transferred back into the United States through an alleged mortgage
fraud scam involving politicians in Florida.''

2 CONVICTED IN CAVIAR SMUGGLING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.Y.)  (js) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A major caviar importer who supplies restaurants and
retailers across the United States was convicted Wednesday of
smuggling thousands of pounds of the delicacy into the country to
avoid new restrictions that seek to protect dwindling sturgeon
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   A jury in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn found that Eugeniusz
Koczuk, the owner of Gino International, had brought millions of
dollars worth of Russian sturgeon roe into the United States from
Poland by hiding the tins in the luggage of airline passengers who
were paid several hundred dollars to act as couriers. He was found
guilty of smuggling, of conspiracy, and of four charges of
transportation of illegally possessed wildlife or its products.
</P>
<P>
   The second defendant in the trial, Wieslaw Rozbicki, the
marketing director of Gino International, was convicted of a single
illegal-transportation charge and acquitted of five other charges.
</P>
<P>
   Each man theoretically faces a maximum sentence of five years in
prison and a $250,000 fine. Judge Frederic Block did not set a
sentencing date.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for both men said that the convictions would be
appealed. Block directed that until sentencing, Koczuk, 48, be
confined at his Stamford, Conn., home with an electronic monitoring
device. He permitted Rozbicki, 37, who lives in Brooklyn, to remain
free on a $25,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
   Gino International was operated out of Koczuk's home, and among
the well-known shops it supplied was Zabar's on the Upper West Side
of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The jury issued its verdict after deliberating for nearly a day
and a half in a two-and-a-half-week trial. The defendants were
charged with violating U.S. laws _ intended to enforce an
international threatened species provision in effect since April
1998 _ that ban the importation of caviar without proof that it was
legally harvested.

WOODS COULD BECOME FIRST $6 MILLION MAN
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOTOGRANDE, Spain _ After winning his past three starts, Tiger
Woods hopes to continue his streak in Spain. Returning to the site
of the 1997 Ryder Cup, Woods heads a world-class field competing in
this week's American Express Championship, the final official event
of the 1999 golf season.
</P>
<P>
   Having already clinched the PGA Tour money title, Woods will try
to become the first tour player to win four consecutive starts
since Ben Hogan in 1953. And Woods, who has won more than $5.61
million, could become the first player to surpass $6 million in a
season if he wins this week's $1 million first-place check.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Woods competed at Valderrama Golf Club, he was
part of the 1997 losing U.S. Ryder Cup team, and he struggled to a
1-3-1 record. But Woods has been playing so well lately, no golf
course looks intimidating to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shots that I have in my repertory now are far better than
what I had in 1997,'' said Woods, who has won eight times worldwide
this year, including seven victories in his past 10 starts. ``I'm
very excited about getting out there and playing in a tournament.
It's going to be really interesting to see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the world's top players will be teeing off Thursday in
the 62-man field, including Colin Montgomerie, Sergio Garcia, Davis
Love III, Lee Westwood, Ernie Els and Nick Price. Several top names
who qualified for this new World Golf Championships event, however,
elected not to come, including David Duval, Mark O'Meara and Jesper
Parnevik, who has been told by doctors that he has an irregular
heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik's condition, first discovered at this year's Ryder Cup,
is not believed to be serious, but he took this week off as a
precautionary measure. Duval, O'Meara, Fred Couples, Steve
Stricker, Craig Parry and Lee Jansen head the list of those who
passed up the chance for $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time of year, big money events don't get everybody,''
said Love, who admitted he almost decided not to come. ``These
days, there are so many good golf tournaments, there are a lot of
choices. It makes it easy for us not to travel the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods loves to play worldwide, and the return trip to Valderrama
will give him a chance to conquer a course at which he struggled in
1997. Valderrama is an unusual layout, characterized by tight
target areas and cork trees that overhang many fairways and even
some greens. Many European players are familiar with Valderrama,
having competed there during the Volvo Masters, an event on the
European Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings back good memories every time I play here,'' said
Montgomerie, who is trying to finish No. 1 on the European money
list for the seventh consecutive year. ``It's the first time I
played the course since the '97 Ryder Cup. I stand on the first tee
very, very, confident on this course, as opposed to some, where I
don't feel as comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie added: ``Length is not the greatest advantage on
this course. It's more positioning. I love when other people think
it's tight. I think reward should be given for somebody who hits it
straight.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Montgomerie liked his chances, he knew Woods would be
difficult to beat, coming off a victory Sunday at the Tour
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's determined to prove that there's no course in the world
that Tiger Woods can't win on,'' Montgomerie said. ``That's what we
all want to feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Woods feels as if he can win against anybody,
anywhere. And his superb physical conditioning allows him to stay
sharp during weeks like this, when he is coping with jet lag and
playing his third event in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the greatest players, Gary Player, kept himself in
phenomenal shape,'' Woods said. ``Look at the career he's had. If
you take care of your body, your body will take care of you. That's
what I've done. It hasn't been easy at times when you don't want to
go in that gym. But I've been very dedicated to it, and it has paid
off.''
</P>
<P>
   The payoff on Sunday to the winner will be $1 million. That was
not the only reason Love came. But the prize money didn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never won a $1 million purse before, and I played well
enough to finish second to Tiger last week,'' Love said. ``I'd like
to beat him this week. But he is playing very, very well.'' &QL;

HAVE-NOTS MAY YET HAVE A DAY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As soon as the Seattle Mariners announced that Ken Griffey Jr.
wanted to be traded to a team closer to his Orlando, Fla., home,
the gloom-and-doom set in baseball pounced on the development as
another blow to low-revenue teams. Griffey, they instantly assumed,
would wind up with one of those high-revenue teams with seemingly
unlimited payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, the Texas Rangers traded Juan Gonzalez because
they didn't want to pay him $15 million or more a year in a new
contract and they didn't want to lose him to free agency a year
from now and get nothing for him. But the Rangers did not trade
Gonzalez, their two-time most valuable player, to one of those
high-revenue teams, the Yankees, the Braves, the Orioles, the
Dodgers or a couple of others. Gonzalez next season will wear the
uniform of the Detroit Tigers, heretofore not mistaken for a
high-revenue team.
</P>
<P>
   What's a low-revenue team like the Tigers doing with a
prospective $15 million-a-year player? The answer lies in
definitions and developments.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers traded for Gonzalez because they are moving into a
new park next year and they wanted a marquee player to spur their
season-ticket sales. They estimate that once their 11,500 season
ticket-holders renew for next season, they will have 12,500 season
tickets sold and they hope to reach 18,000. They will be able to
afford Gonzalez because the new park will produce significantly
increased revenue.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco and Houston will also move into new parks next
season. The Mariners moved into a new home this past season.
Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and San Diego have new parks
pending while Boston and Minnesota, maybe Montreal and Florida,
too, have plans or hopes for new playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   The point is the playing and the revenue landscape is changing.
New parks will produce greater revenue, and unless those clubs have
other worthwhile recipients for their added income, they may as
well give it to players who can make them contending teams,
attractive enough to keep those customers coming after the novelty
of new wears off.
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Blue Jays are a prime example of a team that did not
maintain its talent on the field and consequently suffered a severe
drop-off in number of victories, attendance and revenue. They are
trying to resuscitate their fortunes on the field and in the
stands, but they could face a further setback in the coming weeks
and months, just as the Mariners might.
</P>
<P>
   Tigers, Giants, Astros, beware. That could happen to you, too,
once the new park is a couple of years old.
</P>
<P>
   Why is this lesson in income and outlay relevant in November
1999? It's the Gonzalez effect.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez is one of a glittering group of players who, if they
don't sign new contracts, can be free agents a year from now.
Seattle's Griffey and Alex Rodriguez, Manny Ramirez of Cleveland,
Toronto's Shawn Green and Carlos Delgado and Chipper Jones of
Atlanta are others at the forefront of what would be the most
stunning free-agent class in the 25-year history of free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Because Kevin Brown's $15 million-a-year contract established
the floor, market value for these players has skyrocketed and they
have become prime candidates for trades this off season. Like the
Rangers with Gonzalez, clubs are reluctant to hold onto unsignable
players too long, either because they want to avoid the resulting
distraction or because they don't want to suffer the loss with no
return.
</P>
<P>
   But with so few existing high-revenue teams, how are all of
these players supposed to be traded? The Braves aren't trading
Jones, and maybe the Indians will hold onto Ramirez. But that still
leaves a lot of talent for a relatively few teams, if each of those
teams is even inclined to acquire one of those players.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Tigers, though, other teams are likely to step forward,
even some that don't have a new park on the horizon. Jim Bowden,
Cincinnati's crafty general manager, already has expressed a desire
for Griffey and a willingness to take on a big salary for a year.
He did it with Greg Vaughn this year, and the move turned out to be
mightily beneficial for the Reds. Bowden would be happy to pay
Griffey $8.25 million next season, then let him move on.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez at $4.25 million and Ramirez at $4.25 million (as well
as Green and Delgado, who are not signed for next season) are
affordable players for many teams for one season, not just the
high-revenue elite. Unless the trading team makes the price in
players so absolutely prohibitive, one or more of these stars could
wind up in an unexpected place.

   NEW YORK _ Actor Danny Glover, known for his roles in the
``Lethal Weapon'' series, ``Beloved'' and other films, filed a
complaint Wednesday with the city Taxi and Limousine Commission,
charging a cabdriver with discrimination Oct. 9 for refusing to
allow him to ride in the front passenger seat.
</P>
<P>
   Glover, who is black, said he was already angry because several
hours earlier five yellow cabs had failed to stop for him, his
daughter and her roommate at 116th Street and Seventh Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday in the lobby of the Taxi and
Limousine Commission, Glover, with his daughter, Mandisa, a senior
at New York University, at his side, said he had been visiting her
from San Francisco. When those cabs passed them by, Glover said:
``I was so angry. The fact that my daughter's here to go to school,
it really upsets me that if she's standing on the corner waiting to
get a cab, she can't get a cab. It happens to her, it happens to
countless people every single day. The fact that I'm a celebrity,
the fact that I'm visible, allows me to draw attention to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, about 1 a.m., he said, they were trying to flag a cab on
the corner of Houston Street and Second Avenue. A taxi stopped at a
red light. His daughter tried to open one of the cab's back doors,
but found it locked.
</P>
<P>
   The driver unlocked the doors and the two young women got in the
back seat. Glover said he climbed in the front seat and the driver
objected and pushed him. The 6-foot-4 actor said he has a bad hip
and has found the back seats of taxis too confining.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he was going to call the police,'' Glover said. ``I
told him, `I want you to call the police.'''
</P>
<P>
   Glover said he flagged down a passing police van, but the
officers told him he would have to appear before the commission to
file a complaint himself.
</P>
<P>
   The driver could face a fine if Glover's complaint is found to
be valid. Allan Fromberg, a spokesman for the commission, said
Wednesday that passengers are allowed to ride in the front seat of
cabs. ``It seems to me a valid request for a valid reason,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the driver's name was not released because it was
unclear whether Glover wanted to attend a hearing with the driver
or have the matter adjudicated. Indeed, Glover and his lawyer,
Randolph Scott-McLaughlin, a law professor at Pace University, said
they were interested in helping the commission in diversity
training.
</P>
<P>
   The actor and his lawyer said they planned to meet with
officials from the taxi commission to help develop a training video
and to discuss having new drivers meet with ordinary black New
Yorkers as part of their training. ``I think it's a positive way to
go,'' Glover said. ``It would not be in my best interest to just
file a simple complaint. My interest is to change something.''

SENATE PASSES BILLS TO PROMOTE TRADE WITH AFRICA, CARIBBEAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Wednesday approved a far-ranging
package of trade bills for African and Caribbean nations intended
to help flagging economies in those regions by opening new markets.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, passed by a vote of 76-19, would reduce or
eliminate tariffs and quotas on a wide range of goods made in
sub-Saharan Africa, Central America and the Caribbean, mostly
products assembled with textiles made in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   If the legislation, the Africa Trade and Development Act of
1999, becomes law, it will be the first major trade promotion
measure enacted in the United States since the North American Free
Trade Agreement in 1994, a law that established duty-free commerce
between Canada, the United States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation not only offers a solid package for Africa
and the Caribbean basin, but it is good for our people here at
home,'' said Sen. William Roth, R-Del., who heads the Senate
Finance Committee. ``The textile industry says it will bring in
$8.8 billion over five years and provide jobs for 121,000
Americans. And this is just the textile industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The passage of the bill is considered a victory for President
Clinton, who has been lobbying senators by telephone for two weeks,
hoping that the legislation would clear the Senate before a meeting
of top international trade officials on Nov. 30 in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said the vote
would benefit the Seattle talks by demonstrating that ``the
bipartisan consensus for trade, which had been absent in recent
years, has been re-established.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The package now goes to a conference committee with the House,
which approved a bill for Africa that excluded the Caribbean, by a
narrower vote, 234-163, in July. The two sides now have to agree on
whether to include the Caribbean in a final bill, an action that
they are quite likely to take, aides said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the Senate may modify a provision in its bill that
would limit duty-free designations only to clothing made from
fabric, thread or yarn from the United States, a concession to the
textile industry, aides said. The House did not include the
Caribbean in its initiative largely because lawmakers from textile
states and those with labor union constituents had argued that
exports from that region would threaten American jobs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Critics of the Senate bill's provision on Africa have made the
same argument. But the measure's proponents say that U.S. trade
with Africa is relatively small and that any increase in imports
from there would not harm the robust U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for example, U.S. merchandise exports to Africa
totaled $6.7 billion, and imports from Africa amounted to $13.4
billion. Merchandise exports from the 24 nations in the Caribbean
Basin region totaled $19.2 billion, and imports ran to $17.1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, U.S. trade with Japan alone totaled $180 billion
last year, according to the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's supporters contend that removing all quotas and taxes
on African products would stimulate economic growth in the region
and nurture the increasing number of fledgling democracies there.
</P>
<P>
   ``By voting for a new trading partnership with Africa, the
Senate is saying Africa is now too important to ignore,'' said Rep.
Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., a principal sponsor of the measure in the
House. ``There is an economic and political renaissance under way
in sub-Saharan Africa, and this bill allows us to encourage it and
share in it.''
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, the legislation is generally expected to
benefit the Caribbean and Central American regions by allowing
those countries to compete more strongly in a region that has been
hurt by NAFTA. Supporters say the measure would also help offset
the overwhelming devastation caused by a series of hurricanes that
have smashed into the region over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   During its long debate Wednesday, the Senate defeated all but
one amendment offered by critics of the Africa trade bill. On a
vote of 96-0, the Senate adopted an amendment by Sen. Tom Harkin,
D-Iowa, that would deny trade benefits to any country whose
government condoned child abuse like child prostitution and forcing
children to handle hazardous materials.

RADAR SHOWS DOOMED JET DIVED, THEN CLIMBED BEFORE CRASHING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ERIC BERGER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ After a harrowing 40-second dive in which
EgyptAir Flight 990 lost half its altitude, the jetliner climbed
nearly 8,000 feet before plummeting again and breaking apart, radar
data released Wednesday night indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Although National Transportation Safety Board officials refused
to speculate about what happened on board the doomed airliner
Sunday, the finding raised assumptions that its pilots managed to
regain control of the aircraft before a final catastrophic crash
into the Atlantic Ocean, killing 217 people.
</P>
<P>
   The radar data show the airplane following a straight path from
its cruising altitude of 33,000 feet through its fall to 16,700
feet shortly before 2 a.m. EST, about 30 minutes after departing
John F. Kennedy Airport in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The plane held to its straight heading as it climbed, perhaps
for about 8 seconds, to 24,000 feet. It then swerved and descended
to 10,000 feet in half a minute, at which point radar picked up the
apparent breakup of the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (final) descent was rapid,'' said John Clark, deputy
director of the NTSB's office of research and engineering.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB officials said they did not have readings below 10,000
feet.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacular account of the plane's descent provided new
information on a day that otherwise stymied investigators. Fifty
mph wind gusts and 22 foot seas kept all but one Coast Guard cutter
from the search area about 65 miles south of Nantucket, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Port-bound crews spent the day unloading the materials they had
found in the first three days of searching the sea's surface,
including personal effects, seat cushions, a nose tire, a wheel,
five emergency slides and some spoiler panels.
</P>
<P>
   One sailor said he cried when he found a child's pair of
Rollerblades.
</P>
<P>
   So far none of the retrieved materials have shown burn marks
from explosions or other causes that might explain the crash, said
NTSB Chairman Jim Hall.
</P>
<P>
   FBI and NTSB officials continued to refuse to describe the
accounts of two eyewitnesses in Nantucket who reported seeing a
streak of light across the sky at the time of the crash. Hall said
officials did not want those accounts to influence other people who
may have witnessed the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Hall and the NTSB's investigator-in-charge, Gregory Phillips,
spent much of Wednesday night discussing engine thrust reversers,
which some observers have focused on as a possible cause of the
Boeing 767 crash.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots who flew the plane reported to the NTSB that one of
Flight 990's engine thrust reversers was not working and had been
deactivated.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1991 crash, 233 people were killed when a Lauda 767 slammed
into a jungle hilltop in Thailand after its thrust reversers
deployed about 10 minutes into the flight. Boeing then redesigned
the mechanism that controls the thrust reverser. The reversers are
used only after touchdown, to slow the plane on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   EgyptAir made the recommended changes to the thrust reversers on
the Flight 990 plane in 1993, the airline said.
</P>
<P>
   But since the post-Lauda recommendations, the Federal Aviation
Administration has proposed two more airworthiness directives this
year that deal with thrust reverser safety issues.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, EgyptAir officials said one of Flight 990's thrust
reversers was deactivated before the flight left Cairo last week
because maintenance crews there found a leak in the system that
controls the reversers. The flight still met regulations for safe
flying, U.S. investigators said, because airplanes are allowed to
fly with only one operating thrust reverser.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not uncommon to deactivate a thrust reverser,'' Phillips
said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The airline did not fix the leak in Cairo because it did not
have the correct spare parts. But EgyptAir planned to repair the
problem within the 10 days allowed by international aviation
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Several aviation experts discounted the possibility of thrust
reversers contributing to the Flight 990 crash.
</P>
<P>
   If a thrust reverser were to malfunction during flight, the
engine would fire in the opposite direction, causing the plane to
turn sharply, likely sending the plane spinning out of control,
they suggested.
</P>
<P>
   At an elevation of 33,000 feet, Flight 990's cruise altitude,
several aviation officials said, the pilots would have had time to
regain control of the plane, discounting the possibility of a
thrust reverser problem.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots also would have been able to radio a distress call if
the reverser misfired, said Isam Ahmed, head of Egypt's Civil
Aviation Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something had happened inside the cabin that prevented the
pilot and the co-pilots from sending the distress warning,'' Ahmed
told The Associated Press in Cairo. ``Maybe something happened
inside the cabin first that cut the communications. We must
concentrate on the cabin area.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Phillips noted that the Lauda pilots in 1991 did not
make an SOS call to the control tower during its tragic descent.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are banking on the successful efforts of the USS
Grapple and other Navy ships to recover the flight data and voice
recorders, which are the keys to deciphering what happened.
Previously, acoustic signals locating the ``black boxes'' were
found, but the storms moved in before they could be recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the flight data recorder will show us if the thrust
reverser activated,'' Hall said Monday night.

 &HT;    MEXICO'S RULING PARTY HOLDS SELF-CONGRATULATORY CAMPAIGN CLOSURE
 &HT;    (600&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ After three months of unprecedented internecine
warfare, Mexico's ruling party Wednesday night closed its first
presidential primary campaign with a self-congratulatory event
unifying its four candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the candidates _ underdog Manuel Bartlett _ used his
speech to strongly attack what he characterized as an unfair,
undemocratic campaign conducted by the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI. Mexico's voters go to the polls Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't deceive ourselves,'' said Bartlett, a former
governor of Puebla state, who, ironically, has a reputation in
Mexico for being autocratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has not been a race run in accordance with the rules,''
he said. ``The (campaign) spending has been scandalous and has
exceeded the established limits . . . The misuse of (government)
resources has been denounced in vain.''
</P>
<P>
   The surprise of the night was that Roberto Madrazo, who is
running a close second to frontrunner Francisco Labastida, offered
a tempered speech after conducting the most aggressive campaign of
any of the contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI, the world's longest ruling party, has controlled
Mexico's presidency for 70 years. The sitting president of the
republic has always selected the PRI's nominee for elections. But
this time, in a historic event billed as a major democratic opening
in Mexico, the PRI will hold a primary election open to all Mexican
voters this Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The winner will go on to compete in Mexico's July 2, 2000
presidential election, where the PRI could face strong competition.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI, which is supervising its own primary, has invited
national and foreign observers to witness the balloting. But the
highly respected Carter Center in Atlanta, which has observed many
elections in Mexico and Latin America, said it would not
participate because the invitation arrived only a week before the
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a professional organization,'' said Shelley McConnell,
the center's Latin American and Caribbean Program associate
director. ``We're not doing an observation on a week's notice.
We're not election tourists.''
</P>
<P>
   Just days before the primary, one candidate _ Labastida, a
former interior minister _ appears to have gained a healthy lead in
some new polls. But the competition has been fierce, particularly
from Madrazo, the former Tabasco state governor.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, the campaign's image has been tarnished by
accusations that Labastida has benefited from the PRI's
old-fashioned political machine, which has guaranteed votes by
employing pressure tactics by government and party officials as
well as gifts of pre-election food and other services for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo has been particularly aggressive in these denunciations,
as well as in his unusually hard-hitting television ads attacking
Labastida's competency and labeling him a status-quo candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday night _ after offering a more fiery speech to
supporters at a closing rally in Mexico City _ Madrazo appeared
subdued and supportive of the party's leadership. He portrayed
himself again as a candidate of change that could help the party
retrieve its revolutionary roots and connection to the poor and
disenfranchised.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to vote for change because that's what elections
are about,'' Madrazo said. The primary election, he said, is a
choice for voters to ``vote for the same (candidates) we always
vote for, or vote for a change that will strengthen our party and
put it at the center of a national transformation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With the PRI, this can be done,'' Madrazo said, ending his
speech with a show of confidence for the party.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, at his closing campaign rally, Madrazo was
more hostile, distancing himself from the current government, which
is comprised of a faction of the PRI with which he has had
disagreements.
</P>
<P>
   Although he didn't refer to Labastida by name, Madrazo took a
veiled swipe at the frontrunner by referring to ``those who instead
of offering proposals, make threats, who instead of winning
consciences, want to buy them.''
</P>
<P>
   Labastida is widely viewed in Mexico as President Ernesto
Zedillo's favorite choice as a successor, but Zedillo has remained
publicly silent on who he prefers.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida Wednesday night focused less on himself than on
praising the PRI for opting to hold a primary election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are making history,'' he said. ``Our party is showing that
it is at the vanguard of a democracy. No other party has allowed
itself to have a primary election as democratic as this one. No
other party has allowed its grassroots so much power to elect its
candidate. With this new PRI, democracy will be consolidated in
Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Mexico City's Reforma newspaper published a poll
showing that Labastida was preferred by 44 percent of likely
voters, compared to Madrazo's 33 percent. The same poll found that
51 percent of those surveyed didn't know about the primary or had
forgotten about it.
</P>
<P>
   The primary is open to all Mexicans with a voter credential, but
most of those who turn out are expected to be PRI sympathizers.

EDITORIAL: CHARTER REFORM LOSES  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Nov. 4:
</P>
<P>
   Only sheer determination propelled voters from New York City and
Nassau County out into the wind and rain Tuesday to send their
unmistakable messages. In New York they defeated Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's misguided attempts to revise the City Charter, to leave
what he called a ``shadow'' of his strong personality behind in the
structure of city government. In Nassau, voters ended a century of
one-party rule and gave Democrats their first turn at fixing that
suburban county's humiliating fiscal crisis in an era of personal
and governmental plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani later acknowledged, in an admirably conciliatory
manner, that he had made a mistake by creating this year's Charter
Revision Commission. Composed of his supporters, the commission
hastily created a package of items that camouflaged other changes
that would have hampered the city's budget-making process and
disrupted the balance of power between mayor and City Council. Now
that the package has been defeated, some of the better ideas, like
a ``gun-free'' zone around schools, can be considered on individual
bases through the normal process in the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   While the ballot proposal might have looked reasonable to voters
who had not studied its details, those who made it to the polls
apparently recognized it for the chicanery that it was. The City
Charter should not be anyone's political plaything. Revising this
document, which serves as a kind of constitution for the city,
should be an extremely serious business, like the deliberative
process that resulted in the last worthy charter revision a decade
ago.
</P>
<P>
   This year's charter process was also a waste of the taxpayers'
money. The charter commission used over $1 million on its various
promotional efforts, including mailings emblazoned with large
photos of the mayor. City Council Speaker Peter Vallone and Mark
Green, the public advocate, also sent out publicly financed
mailings that appeared to veer from education to advocacy. There
are better ways to spend the city's money.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, Republican-run Nassau County has been
managing public funds so badly in recent years that voters gave
Democrats a 10-9 edge in the county's legislature. While the rest
of the country prospered, Nassau found itself facing a $300 million
deficit earlier this year because lawmakers there held property
taxes to a minimum, allowed expenses to rise and filled the gaps
with one-time sales of assets.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaning this up, however, might not be as easy as the Democrats
expect. Property taxes have already risen once this year, and
Democrats could end up controlling a county legislature that has to
give residents even more bad tax news to balance the budget. Still,
voters apparently agreed that they no longer wanted a Republican
Tammany Hall, preferring instead two parties watching each other
carefully.

FEAR STALKS SEATTLE IN WAKE OF SHOOTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ People locked their doors, pulled their shades and hid
in their homes last night in the normally placid Wallingford
neighborhood as police searched for a gunman responsible for a
deadly rampage hours earlier in the offices of a shipyard building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm totally freaked,'' said schoolteacher Debbie Black, who
had a friend help check the doors and windows of her home Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm hoping police know more than they're saying, but
that's probably ridiculously optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   As the gunman remained at large, police urged residents to
report open garage doors, broken windows or anything else amiss at
home. Their neighborhood had been added to the list of American
communities shaken by a mass shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday it was Honolulu. Wednesday it was Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman, who wore a dark trenchcoat over camouflage clothing,
shot four men at the Northlake Shipyard building _ killing two _
just before 10:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Then, witnesses say, he walked calmly outside, vanishing into
the crowded commercial district on the north side of Lake Union and
the tree-lined streets of Wallingford above it.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were apparently strangers to him. Police did not
know the gunman's identity or his motive last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's a real whodunit,'' said Sgt. Cynthia Tallman
of the homicide unit.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman, however, seemed sure of his target. He walked
through the front door of the Northlake Shipyard building, passed
other offices and arrived at a small back office that contained
only a desk, two tables and four workers.
</P>
<P>
   He shot and killed Peter Giles, 27, who lived in the Queen Anne
neighborhood of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Brisendine, 43, was shot three times in the chest.
Brisendine, who had a wife and four children at home in Lynnwood,
died later on the operating table at Harborview Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   A 58-year-old man who was shot once in the chest was in serious
condition in Harborview's intensive-care unit last night. A
19-year-old man who was shot in the arm was in satisfactory
condition last night.
</P>
<P>
   During the rampage, the gunman said nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in calmly,'' said Jeannie Parr, who works in the same
building across the hallway. ``I didn't hear any sounds of a
confrontation or argument. ... All I heard was gunshots.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the carnage created by up to nine shots from a
semiautomatic 9-mm pistol was left for arriving police and
paramedics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were bodies all over the place and gunpowder was still
in the air. All I saw was smoke and a lot of blood,'' said a
mechanic who works at Jeff's Diesel Works below the shipyard
office.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds before he saw the slaughter, the mechanic heard cries
for help. He headed upstairs to find the wounded Brisendine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard Russ screaming `Help me' and I found him hanging out
the window,'' said the mechanic, who didn't want to be named.
</P>
<P>
   Brisendine soon lost consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Slava Kharchenko was working on a crane in the shipyard when he
heard what he thought was a piece of metal hitting the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I looked down and I saw Russ, our electrician, bent over
and hanging out of the window,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Climbing down from the crane, Kharchenko ran into the office to
discover each man there had been shot.
</P>
<P>
   Giles was slumped in a chair, his back to the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``His lips already were bluish. His eyes were wide open. He is
the best guy I ever saw. It is too sad,'' Kharchenko said.
</P>
<P>
   Giles was running the business for his uncles, who own the
shipyard at 1441 Northlake Way. They were vacationing Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Kelly, Giles' 82-year-old grandfather, said the four men
just happened to be in the business office when the gunman walked
in. Kelly said robbery couldn't have been a motive: The business
never had more than $50 in petty cash on hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy just barged into the office and killed my grandson
and wounded the other three,'' said Kelly, a Magnolia resident.
`It's just a terrible thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Next door to Northlake Shipyard, someone ran into Mike
Magnussen's business and yelled, ``There's been a shooting in the
building!'' Magnussen, who owns Seaborn Pile Driving Co., was told
to hide in a back room and wait for police.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just terrible; it's unnerving,'' said Magnussen. ``It's a
really awful thing to have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Paul Schell called the shooting a sad day for Seattle.
``Our hearts go out to everyone impacted by this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there's a lesson here that we need to be much more
vigilant about guns,'' he added quietly.
</P>
<P>
   In Olympia, Gov. Gary Locke also expressed sorrow at what had
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their
families, and with the police officers who are putting themselves
at risk as they search for the individual responsible for this
horrible act,'' Locke said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, D.C., President Clinton noted with sadness the
Seattle shootings and Tuesday's tragedy in Honolulu in which seven
people were killed at a Xerox office by a former employee. Clinton
said the incidents underscore the need for stronger gun control.
</P>
<P>
   After the Wallingford gunman fled, dozens of heavily armed
officers aided by police dogs launched a manhunt, scouring
businesses, homes and parks in the vicinity. SWAT team members in
an armored personnel carrier rumbled down neighborhood streets.
</P>
<P>
   Police had a helicopter in the air and boats patrolling Lake
Union in case the shooter attempted to flee by water.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of a gunman being loose on city streets prompted
the lockdown of eight Seattle public schools. Only three, however,
were close to the shooting scene: B.F. Day Elementary, Hamilton
Middle School and Latona Alternative Elementary.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-afternoon, officials allowed the students to go home for
the day. Several day-care centers also locked down.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Norm Stamper went door to door, urging Wallingford
residents to take caution, while officers mounted an intensive
search of Gasworks Park on Lake Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our doors are locked, and our blinds are down, and we're
terrified,'' said Keri Cross, the receptionist at Restaurants
Unlimited next to Gasworks Park where 60 employees were trapped.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours after the shooting, police chased numerous leads
that proved false.
</P>
<P>
   Officers brandishing guns boarded a Metro bus on 15th Avenue
near the Interbay golf course in hopes of finding the gunman. Metro
dispatchers, meanwhile, radioed out reports of the suspect's
description.
</P>
<P>
   After reports of a disturbance near some small businesses at
Bagley Avenue North and North 36th Street, the SWAT team deployed.
Officers and dogs surrounded the complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they find him, and he's not hiding in there after they
leave,'' said Christian Weber, president of Liquisite.com, the
business at which employees called police.
</P>
<P>
   Neighorhood residents watched the SWAT team take up positions in
the rain. ``I heard on the radio that the guy may be in our
neighborhood,'' one resident said. ``I hope they find him in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Andre Teves and her friend, Michelle Pleasant, sat in Pleasant's
hair salon at 11:15 a.m. with the door deadbolted shut, only
allowing people in if they showed identification.
</P>
<P>
   In the more residential area that police were concerned with,
people peeked through window blinds at police and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Police closed part of the Burke-Gilman Trail while SWAT team
members in the personnel carrier looked for the suspect in the
bushes. The hunt blocked joggers and bicyclists, who stood in the
rain in Spandex shorts and windbreakers, wondering if the man they
saw in a house's window playing steel drums had anything to with
the shooting. He didn't.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the gunman's description was broadcast, people
bombarded police with possible sightings. Three were reported in
Ballard in just 15 mintues.
</P>
<P>
   Another involved the Fremont branch of the Seattle Public
Library. SWAT officers dispatched to find the man, described as
wearing a dark coat and camouflage, returned empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   It was at least the second fatal shooting in the neighborhood
this decade.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1992, David Tippet, who owned another shipyard in the
area, was shot to death at a neighborhood restaurant. A former
employee offered an ex-convict $35,000 to kill Tippet.
</P>

BUSH _ American Indian leaders say Texas Gov. George W. Bush
misconstrued 200 years of constitutional law when he asserted that
state law takes precedence in such Indian issues as gaming. Bush,
in Syracuse, N.Y., four weeks ago for a fund-raiser for his
Republican presidential campaign, was quoted in the Syracuse (N.Y.)
Post-Standard as saying, ``My view is that state law reigns supreme
when it comes to the Indians, whether it be gambling or any other
issue.'' By JEFF BARKER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL;

MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) _ Lynda Bertelson Jensen, who was 53, died
alone in her home in Tempe about a month ago. She was a mother and
grandmother, a sister, an aunt. She'd been in Arizona for several
years working as a pharmacist. She had friends here, and
co-workers. Her obituary didn't appear in The Arizona Republic,
however. As far as her family is concerned, Lynda's death notice
already had been printed in the paper. It ran Sept. 27 on page B-1
under a headline reading: ``Druggist trails record of addiction.''

BAFFERT HAS A WAY OF CHARMING OWNERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ The Houston football owner sends horses to
Bob Baffert because the wise-cracking trainer makes a day at the
racetrack more fun. The Riverside County freeway landscaper employs
Baffert because he's a straight shooter _ and because he charmed
the man's wife.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon lumber baron praises Baffert's ``eye and empathy''
for horses. The San Diego grocer likes Baffert's knack for running
fit horses in races they can win.
</P>
<P>
   And the Washington-state cheeseburger king, the best friend who
brought Baffert to the thoroughbred world in the first place, isn't
surprised that such a variety of racehorse owners are drawn to the
46-year-old trainer with the distinctive _ if not quite
distinguished _ white hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got 'em in all shapes and sizes, hasn't he?'' said Mike
Pegram, the operator of 21 McDonald's franchises and the owner of
two of Baffert's horses in Saturday's Breeders' Cup at Gulfstream
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert will be represented in six races by eight horses,
including morning-line favorites Silverbulletday (Distaff), Forest
Camp (Juvenile) and Chilukki (Juvenile Fillies), on what could be
the greatest Breeders' Cup day a trainer has ever had.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert's horses will race under the colors of five different
owners, without whose confidence he wouldn't be where he is this
week. &QL; 
BOB AND JANIE McNAIR
</P>
<P>
   Racing under the name Stonerside Stable, they'll have Chilukki
in the Juvenile Fillies and Tuzla in the Mile.
</P>
<P>
   McNair sold his power cogeneration business for $1.5 billion and
bought Houston an NFL franchise for $1 billion a few months later.
So how much of a thrill can he get watching a filly purchased at
auction for $875,000 run in a $1 million race?
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets a tremendous thrill out of it,'' said John Adger, the
McNairs' racing manager. ``I kid Janice (who grew up on dressage in
South Carolina) the horses are her NFL franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   The McNairs got into racing as co-owners of Southern Truce
shortly after she won the Santa Monica Handicap at Santa Anita on
the day of the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. They had shares of 1994
Kentucky Derby runner-up Strodes Creek and 1997 Belmont Stakes
winner Touch Gold. They've won graded stakes with four trainers in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, people who have made it in the business world
are in racing to have fun,'' Adger said at Gulfstream Park on why
Baffert is their West Coast trainer. ``On top of (his training),
he's just a very engaging guy. He doesn't take himself too
seriously.'' &QL; 
HUGO REYNOLDS &UR; !dtpost!!off! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   He'll have his first Breeders' Cup in 25 years as a thoroughbred
owner when River Keen, a $1.3 million earner since Reynolds claimed
him for $100,000 last December, runs in the Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, a 60-year-old Georgia native, lives in Norco and runs
a freeway landscaping (or ``erosion control'') business in Corona.
He beat prostate cancer and wife, Patsy, lost a leg to a blood clot
after suffering a heart attack during back surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The success of 6-year-old River Keen ``has turned our lives
around,'' Reynolds said on the phone. ``We think this was actually
destined to come to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reynolds met Baffert five or six years ago, when they sat in
adjacent boxes at Fairplex Park. Patsy was taken with the trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were with him before he became what he is now,'' Hugo said.
``One thing that I didn't have with other trainers _ if a horse
isn't any good, it doesn't take him long to tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Reynolds, not Baffert, who decided they should claim
River Keen, an Irish bred with a history of foot problems and
respiratory bleeding. Under the care of Baffert and staff, River
Keen won the Grade I Woodward at 5-1 odds and Jockey Club Gold Cup
at 12-1 in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's trainers who don't care a lot about (Baffert),
but I think that's a bit of jealousy. He did come up pretty
quick,'' Reynolds said. ``His type you can't hold down too long.'' &QL; 
AARON AND MARIE JONES
</P>
<P>
   They'll seek their first Breeders' Cup wins with Forest Camp in
the Juvenile and Forestry in the Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 78, founder of the Seneca Sawmill and Seneca Timber
companies in Eugene, Ore., was about to sell his farm and
racehorses after the damaging capital-gains tax law change of 1986.
Then Jones was diagnosed with cancer and called off the sales
``because I didn't want people to think it was a death sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Cured by surgery, Jones began buying horses again in 1996. He
got in touch with Baffert through a Kentucky farm owner after
seeing how much fun his University of Oregon classmates Bob and
Beverly Lewis had with Baffert-trained Kentucky Derby and Preakness
winner Silver Charm.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert had met the Joneses only by phone when he led them to
purchase Forestry for a sales-topping $1.5 million at a July 1997
Kentucky yearling sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a natural-born horseman. It's been his life ever since
he's been big enough to walk,'' said Jones, who, like Baffert, grew
up in Arizona. ``I swear he can read (horses') minds. He trains
horses hard, but he breaks down fewer than any trainer I've ever
known.'' Jones called Baffert ``second to none when it comes to
picking a good racing individual.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't buy the image of Baffert as a late riser who leans on
his assistants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been there at midnight or 1 or 2 in the morning with a
sick horse, and Baffert's there,'' Jones said on the phone, joking
that with their seven-days-a-week work schedules, ``I think
trainers shouldn't be allowed to get married.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, in fact, is separated from his wife, Sherry, and four
children, and is living in a hotel near Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   Jones isn't put off, as some older racing people are, by Baffert
pranks, like putting the Kentucky Derby trophy on his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just letting off steam,'' he said. &QL; 
JOHN AND BETTY MABEE
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge, the 3-year-old Santa Anita Derby and Pacific
Classic winner who's running in the Classic, represents the Mabees'
14th attempt at a Breeders' Cup win.
</P>
<P>
   John Mabee, 78, founded the Big Bear grocery chain and the
Golden Eagle Insurance company _ he was forced to sell the latter
in 1997 after a run-in with state regulators _ and is one of San
Diego County's largest land owners.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of Golden Eagle Farm in Ramona, best known for producing
Best Pal, the Mabees are perennially California's top breeders.
They added Baffert to their ever-changing list of trainers five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obvious to me he was getting as much out of horses as
any trainer I'd seen (and) he knows how to spot horses,'' Mabee
said while watching General Challenge get a bath Wednesday morning.
``I learned from one of my first trainers that you want to win 25
percent of your races and be in the money 50 percent. It's amazing
how many trainers don't think that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert's stats in 1999: 25 percent winners, 54 percent in the
money.
</P>
<P>
   Does Mabee like the fun Baffert brings?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the thing,'' he said stiffly. ``Just the fact he
gets the best out of the horse.'' &QL; 
MIKE PEGRAM
</P>
<P>
   Silverbulletday, the 1998 Juvenile Fillies winner, would be the
first horse to win two different Breeders' Cup races. Pegram also
has Captain Steve in the Juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   The freewheeling Pegram, 47, wore jeans to the Derby and
flaunted his love of Silverbullets and Big Macs before a recent
no-beer and no-burgers diet. (``I got on the scale and I said, `How
can I do this (lose weight) the quickest?' '')
</P>
<P>
   Pegram bankrolled his trainer's step up to thoroughbreds in
1991. A year later he was a partner in Thirty Slews, Baffert's
first Breeders' Cup winner. He owns Kentucky Derby and Preakness
winner Real Quiet and about 30 other Baffert-trained horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Baffert) gets along with people and he respects people,
from his owners to the employees in his barn,'' Pegram said.
</P>
<P>
   Pegram remembers when Baffert worried that he'd wouldn't be able
to attract thoroughbred owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier now,'' he said with a laugh. ``Owners are
seeking him out.''

LODGING MARKET REBOUNDS IN LOS ANGELES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON TAKENOUCHI 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The upcoming Democratic Convention, the new
Staples Center and other major projects will push Los Angeles-area
hotels' occupancy rates to their highest levels in two decades,
according to an annual forecast to be released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The report by Los Angeles-based PKF Consulting estimates that
demand for hotel rooms will increase 2.5 percent in the coming
year, with occupancy hitting 75.5 percent, 1 percent more than the
1999 estimate. Room rates are expected to grow at an even faster
clip _ around 4.5 percent _ because of limited supply.
</P>
<P>
   Increased business in the hotel industry is reflected behind the
scenes as well, as some older hotels complete major refurbishments
and new hotels open in hot spots such as Santa Clarita and Santa
Monica.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gods are going to be shining on us next year,'' said Jack
Kyser, chief economist with the nonprofit Los Angeles Economic
Development Corp. ``Right now we're in the midst of a tremendous
amount of development of tourist projects.''
</P>
<P>
   PKF will release the report as part of the UCLA Extension's 11th
Annual Southern California Visitor Industry Outlook Conference,
which begins Friday at the Long Beach Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   The study draws a generally positive picture of the overall
lodging market.
</P>
<P>
   The $400 million Staples Center, the Democratic Convention in
August and the return of the Grammy Awards to Los Angeles should
stoke hotel demand in the near future, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   But the study said real opportunities for growth will occur in a
year or two, when the Hollywood/Highland redevelopment project,
Disney's California Adventure theme park and other major
attractions open their doors.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its glowing news about growing demand, however, the
report underscores one serious problem in the area's hotel market:
undersupply.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the total supply of available rooms
will grow by just 1.2 percent next year, far slower than the growth
in demand. In the heady days of the late 1980s, room supply grew by
nearly 5 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are pulling back on hotel development,'' Kyser said.
``They don't do good market research to understand there's still a
lot of good market potential in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huntington Development Group is one developer that is doing
the research and making the investment.
</P>
<P>
   The Maryland-based company has plans to build hotels in Burbank,
Santa Clarita and El Segundo. The Santa Clarita proposal _ a 130-
to 135-bed Courtyard by Marriott _ was approved last month by the
Santa Clarita Community College District that owns the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``California in general is a strong hotel market, but Los
Angeles has really rebounded since the early '90s, when the defense
industry went south,'' said Jeremy Andrus, the Los Angeles area
representative for Huntington Development.
</P>
<P>
   Andrus said he was particularly surprised by the growth of area
office markets, which Huntington Development considers a
prerequisite for a good hotel market.
</P>
<P>
   The AirTel Plaza Hotel in Van Nuys also is betting on the
upswing. Spokesman Jack McGrath said $1 million is being spent to
renovate meeting rooms, guest rooms and other parts of the
15-year-old hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Wycoff, senior managing director of Landauer Realty
Group, Inc., a Los Angeles-based real estate consulting firm, said
tourism is behind much of the new demand for hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   But Wycoff said demand will not lead to a building boom because
investors have been wary of hotel projects in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems stem from a little bit of overbuilding, primarily
in the Southeast,'' he said. ``Usually when investors tire of an
asset class, they cease making distinctions.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the study's sub-market forecasts:
</P>
<P>
   -- The San Fernando Valley market will remain flat at 72.2
percent occupancy rate in 2000, with average room rates rising to
$109.
</P>
<P>
   -- In Santa Clarita, newly added supply will push occupancy
rates down to 68.9 percent in 2000, with average rooms rates rising
to $90.

OREGON STATE NO LONGER A DOORMAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A small forest has been felled to accommodate the
newsprint required for all the stories documenting the decline of
the Pacific-10 Conference. But up in Oregon, there is a compelling
success story that has nothing to do with the Ducks or Nike.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State is just a victory away from the school's first
winning season since 1970 and first bowl berth since the 1965 Rose
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not the same Beavers we used to be,'' said wide
receiver Imani Percoats. ``We're the New Age Beavers, the
millennium Beavers.''
</P>
<P>
   The transformation really began under former coach Mike Riley,
who guided the Beavers to a 5-6 record last season with harrowing
losses to UCLA and Washington before departing for the San Diego
Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   But just as impressively, new coach Dennis Erickson has made the
transition from Riley almost seamless, without any
getting-to-know-you difficulties associated with first-year
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN was in Corvallis last week and the Beavers got considerable
coverage in a Sports Illustrated story that ran a few weeks ago
about the spread offense.
</P>
<P>
   Bowl representatives are even starting to show up at Oregon
State games and one bowl prognosticator has penciled the Beavers in
for the Oahu Bowl on Dec. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Erickson dismisses the hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not fazed by it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy for the players. Happy that they can have this
success and have the opportunity to do something great for this
program. I don't think Oregon State has sat here at 5-3 going into
November with so much hope, not for a long, long time, anyway.''

   Rose Bowl mess: Stanford was the flavor of the month for the
Rose Bowl berth in October, but now Washington has suddenly become
the popular choice after defeating the Cardinal last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But Arizona and Oregon remain in the race, and truth is, nobody
really knows what will happen in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a few possible scenarios if the Huskies fail to win their
final three games.
</P>
<P>
   _In a two-team tie with Washington and Stanford, or Washington
and Oregon, the Huskies would go based on having beaten Stanford
and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   _Oregon would win a two-team tie with Stanford because of its
better nonconference record.
</P>
<P>
   _In a three-way tie involving Stanford, Washington and Arizona
at 6-2, the Wildcats would go to Pasadena by virtue of their 3-0
nonconference record (the loss to Penn State in the Pigskin Classic
doesn't count).
</P>
<P>
   _In a four-way tie involving Washington, Oregon, Stanford and
Arizona at 6-2, Oregon would go if Arizona beats Washington because
Stanford and Washington would be eliminated by the points system,
leaving Oregon and Arizona _ and Oregon beat Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   _If, somehow, Washington, Stanford, Arizona and Arizona State
all tied (possible only if all finish 5-3), the bid would go to
Arizona based on its nonconference record.
</P>
<P>
   Stolen signals: Before the season started, Colorado coach Gary
Barnett said his staff included ``one of the best there is'' at
deciphering sideline sign language. The unidentified staffer's
presence paid off last weekend against Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, the Sooners showed a formation that
included motion and usually resulted in a screen pass. When a
delay-of-game penalty stopped it before it started, the staffer saw
the Oklahoma offensive coordinator ``roll his hands for the same
play.''
</P>
<P>
   The signal was caught on the Colorado sidelines and relayed to
cornerback Ben Kelly, who intercepted a pass at the 3-yard line and
nearly scored a touchdown. The Buffaloes did score a touchdown and
ended up defeating Oklahoma 38-24.
</P>
<P>
   Crank calls: Last Thursday night, Colorado quarterback Mike
Moschetti received a series of telephone calls at his Boulder
apartment from persons saying things such as, ``Hey Moschetti,
you're the worst. You're meat Saturday. You're going down.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at 1:30 a.m., Moschetti dialed 69 to determine the
calls' origins. It was area code 405 _ ``Some funky area code'' _
so he called an operator. ``That's an Oklahoma area code,''
Moschetti was told.
</P>
<P>
   Moschetti, who didn't know how his telephone number got to
Oklahoma fans, finally unplugged the telephone and went to sleep,
thinking, ``I'm going to stick it up, well, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami update: During Tuesday's Big East presidents meeting in
Philadelphia, University of Miami president Tad Foote stole the
show.
</P>
<P>
   Foote was so convincing in declaring to the other 12 Big East
presidents that Miami is solid in its commitment to the Big East,
the league decided to move Virginia Tech's full-time inclusion up
by one year to July 1, 2000 instead of July 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't just the message, it was the expressions of the
message,'' Big East commissioner Mike Tranghese said. ``Our people
were ecstatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami had been talking to the Atlantic Coast Conference about
switching leagues. &QL;

<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ After EgyptAir Flight 990 dove steeply in its
final minutes, approaching or even reaching the speed of sound, the
plane slowed its decline and then climbed again before plunging
once more and apparently breaking up, according to new radar data
released here Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the National Transportation Safety Board said that
they would wait until they had the flight data recorder and cockpit
voice recorder in hand before concluding that the plane broke up,
but John Clark, the deputy directory of the board's office of
research and engineering, said that the radar showed multiple blips
at an altitude of 10,000 feet that were no longer ``consistent with
a flying airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane turned right at one point during its descent, but
seemed, as it finally appeared to cease flying, to turn to the
left. The parts drifted with the wind and took some two minutes and
forty seconds to fall below the radar horizon, about 1,800 feet
above the sea.
</P>
<P>
   As previously reported, the plane took 40 seconds to descend
from 33,000 feet, its assigned altitude, to 16,700 feet, where the
device that reports back to shore on its altitude ceased to
function. Investigators said Wednesday night that two Air Force
radars then tracked to 24,000 _ a sudden ascent of about 8,000 feet
_ and then resume its descent.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators would not speculate on whether the pilots were
trying to regain control as the plane stopped its descent and
climbed more than a mile and resumed its plunge. The flight data
recorder, which the Navy is seeking to recover, would indicate
whether the engines were still running and what forces the crew and
passengers where subjected to in the plunge and climb. The climb
came after the plane's transponder stopped working, raising the
question whether the electrical systems were still working to power
the black boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The airplane is not designed to fly above 90 percent of the
speed of sound, about 743 miles an hour at sea level, and could
have been weakened by flying too fast, or could have broken up from
stress if the pilots tried to pull it out of its initial dive, or
for other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force radars, located at Riverhead, N.Y. in eastern Long
Island, and Truro, Mass., on Cape Cod, cannot see below 8,800 feet,
but a civilian radar on Nantucket can see down to 1,800 feet. Its
data has not been fully analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday a storm system brought whipping winds and 20-foot
swells to the patch of ocean roughly 50 miles off the shore of
Nantucket, Mass., where the Boeing 767 plunged into the sea early
Sunday morning, killing all 217 aboard. The storm drove all but one
of the search and salvage ships back to port here.
</P>
<P>
   (START OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At the Naval station here and the Rhode Island Air National
Guard base across Narragansett Bay at Quonset Point where the
recovery operation is being mounted, it was a day of preparation
for the difficult search ahead and one of rest for some of the men
and women who had gone to the crash site Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``By design, I haven't let myself hear what's going on or feel
what's going on,'' said Lt. j.g. Craig Jaramillo, who was the
acting operations officer at the Coast Guard station at Woods Hole,
Mass., when the call came in that an airplane had disappeared from
radar. ``Later on I'll let myself think about the 217 families and
how it is to lose their loved ones, and I'll think about the kids
that we have in the Coast Guard, young men and women 17 and 18
years old, who are pulling teddy bears out of the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty Officer 3rd Class Philip Dequine, 26, recalled how the
Coast Guard cutter Juniper left on a rescue mission only to find
what he called ``popcorn-sized'' debris. Hopes rose briefly when
his shipmates spotted some intact seat cushions. ``When we saw
bigger stuff, we were hoping somehow, some way, someone would make
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some relatives of the 217 people who died in the crash,
meanwhile, complained that they were running out of patience. At a
tense meeting with government officials Wednesday, several asked to
visit the makeshift morgue that has been established on Quonset
Point for the few human remains that have been collected so far,
and others said they would like to be taken out to sea to visit the
crash site.
</P>
<P>
   Three relatives who were apparently distraught were
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   With the weather expected to improve, investigators can continue
their efforts to recover the plane's flight data recorder and
cockpit voice recorder. Searchers plotted the tentative locations
of the recorders _ the so-called black boxes _ earlier this week
after ships picked up the pinging sounds the boxes emit. Their
recovery from the ocean floor is the mission of the U.S.S. Grapple,
a 255-foot Navy salvage ship that was outfitted here Wednesday with
an underwater robot nicknamed Deep Drone.
</P>
<P>
   The robot, an orange and yellow submersible known in military
circles as a Remotely Operated Vehicle, is equipped with sonar, a
still camera, a video camera and pincers that searchers hope will
be able to grasp the boxes and pull them up.
</P>
<P>
   But should Deep Drone fail in its mission _ if the black boxes
are tangled in wreckage, for example _ the Navy will have to send
divers down to try to retrieve them. Since the wreckage lies in
waters that are estimated to be 240 to 270 feet deep, that will be
a difficult and dangerous endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   Divers will be able to spend only about 30 minutes on the
bottom, where the visibility will be extremely limited and the
water will be so cold that they will need to wear special suits
that circulate hot water pumped from the ship above.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But while safety board investigators hope the black boxes
provide a valuable clue, like a telling conversation captured on
the cockpit voice recorder or some glaring anomaly on the flight
data recorder, the information they contain may not be so
cut-and-dried. If that proves to be the case, investigators from
the board may ask the Navy salvagers to begin recovering more
pieces of the plane for a prolonged forensic inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   It all begins with making a map of the ocean floor, which will
be done by the Whiting, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration ship that pulls a sonar device behind it to collect
data.
</P>
<P>
   With the primary evidence lying in salt water, the recovery
effort will have to be quick. ``The longer the materials are under
the water, the greater the propensity for corrosion and damage,
which can mask the characteristics of bomb damage,'' said William
A. Tobin, a former FBI forensic metallurgist who worked on the
inquiry into the crash of TWA Flight 800 and is now a private
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the ravages of salt water, he said, strong tides
that push sand and silt can damage the underwater wreckage and
destroy valuable evidence, especially when they smooth jagged
fractured surfaces, which are among the most valuable bits of
debris for investigators to study in their quest to learn how the
plane came apart.
</P>
<P>
   In this respect, at least, the cold water could prove an
advantage. ``A cold environment will retard corrosion
significantly,'' Tobin said.

EX-PUBLISHER ASSAILS PAPER IN LOS ANGELES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Otis Chandler, the former publisher of The Los Angeles Times and
the former chairman of the board of its parent company, Wednesday
night offered a sweeping denunciation of the newspaper's current
management for its ``unrealistic and impossible'' circulation
goals, its ``unbelievable stupid and unprofessional'' agreement to
share profits with the management of a downtown arena, and its
contribution to the decline in morale among the newspaper's staff.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler made the comments in a letter to the newspaper's staff.
In a frank repudiation of the policies of the current publisher,
Kathryn M. Downing, and Times Mirror's chief executive, Mark H.
Willes, Chandler, an heir of the family that founded the newspaper,
wrote, ``One cannot successfully run a great newspaper like The Los
Angeles Times with executives in the top two positions, both of
whom have no newspaper experience at any level.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler resigned from the board of Times Mirror last year after
reaching the compulsory retirement age of 70 and has remained
largely silent about the company's new direction under Willes.
While Chandler remains a large stockholder, he has had no
day-to-day role in the company in 19 years. Thus his statement was
regarded as a powerful piece of symbolism, but its likely effect
was unclear at best.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at a car museum he runs in Ojai, Calif., Chandler said
he would not comment on the letter until he had had a chance to
speak to reporters at The Los Angeles Times. The opening sentence
of the letter is addressed to ``the employees of The Los Angeles
Times, particularly of the editorial department because they have
been so abused and misused.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement came as The Times newsroom was still seething over
last week's revelation that the newspaper had entered into an
agreement with the new Staples sports center to share the profits
of a special Oct. 10 issue of the Times Sunday magazine devoted
solely to the center.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler concluded his message with a reference to the members
of his family who founded and ran The Times, saying: ``When I think
back and realize the history of this great newspaper under the
hands of General Otis, Harry Chandler and my father Norman and
succeeding publishers, I realize how fragile and irreplaceable
public trust of a newspaper is. The trust and faith in a newspaper
by its employees, its readers and the community, is dearer to me
than life itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Downing, in an interview conducted shortly before Chandler's
letter was read to the newsroom by the city editor, Bill Boyarsky,
said she had not seen a copy of it. Willes could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Willes, who became chairman and chief executive of Times Mirror,
the newspaper's parent company, in 1995, undertook cutbacks and
economies at The Times and the company's other newspapers that
resulted in a swift rise of the company's stock price, which was
re-energized this summer after languishing in the early part of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Chandler family, through a series of trusts, still holds a
majority of the voting shares in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler's statement came as it was learned that the Staples
Center not only had entered an agreement with the newspaper to
share the profits from the magazine but encouraged one of its
suppliers to buy advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The role of the arena in selling the advertising has become a
bone of contention inside the newspaper, even after Ms. Downing
moved last week to quell a fierce protest in the newsroom over the
profit-sharing arrangement, apologizing to the staff and saying it
reflected her ``fundamental misunderstanding'' of the role of a
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Michael Roth, a spokesman for the
Staples Center, denied that the center had any role in selling
advertising in the magazine. ``It was 100 percent the ad department
at the L.A. Times,'' he said. At a meeting attended by 200 staff
members on Thursday, Ms. Downing was asked about the ad-selling
issue, raised first in an article in The Los Angeles Business
Journal, and left the impression among many editors and reporters
that she had denied it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the answer was pretty categorically no,'' said John
Lindsay, a managing editor in charge of the magazine. ``That's my
recollection.'' But, in two letters sent by the center to a
subcontractor, Anthony Crane Rental, Staples urged that advertising
be purchased. One was signed by Tim Leiweke, the president of the
center.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of the two letters were faxed to The New York Times by
Bob Burt, the marketing director of Anthony Crane Rental's parent
company in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Asked who was soliciting the advertisements, Burt said, ``it was
more a joint thing, and mostly the Staples Center.'' The company
did purchase an advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   In a June 11 letter, the senior vice president for development
of the L.A. Arena Company wrote, ``As an important part of the
Staples Center development team, we expect and would appreciate
your participation in this magazine by purchase of an advertisement
of appropriate size to represent you.''

INVESTIGATORS FOCUS ON A DEVICE THAT CAUSED A '91 CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT NAVAL STATION _ On Sunday, only the second Boeing 767
ever to fall out of the sky _ EgyptAir Flight 990 _ smashed into
the sea under mysterious circumstances. The first 767 to crash, in
May 1991, in Thailand, did so because a thrust reverser, a device
meant to slow a plane on the runway, somehow activated in flight.
In that crash, 223 people died.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, with hardly any wreckage to work with,
investigators talked about what little information they had
concerning EgyptAir 990. One fact they had, though, was destined to
sound provocative: A maintenance job pending on the doomed EgyptAir
flight involved a thrust reverser that had been intentionally
rendered inoperable because of a recent hydraulic leak.
</P>
<P>
   With little new evidence and information coming in because
18-foot seas at the crash site hampered salvage operations, the
mention of a troubled thrust reverser on Egyptair 990 seemed
tantalizingly important. It sounded more so because the Federal
Aviation Administration recently proposed two new directives on
thrust reversers because of problems encountered by planes in
service.
</P>
<P>
   How significant a role the troubled thruster on EgyptAir played
in the crash _ if it played any role at all _ may well not be known
for days, even months or years, and experts said Wednesday that
their current best guess was that its significance may well be
negligible.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have said they are interested in learning
everything they can about the thruster problem, but also everything
else about the plane. There are hundreds of corrective actions that
over the years have been ordered on the 767, and the investigators
want to know if EgyptAir complied with all of them, covering
everything from the fuel pumps, the main landing gear, wire bundles
above the main passenger door, and engine fire detection systems to
instrument-landing-system radio receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, virtually every plane flies at some time with at least
some equipment that is ``inoperable'' and waiting for repair. The
FAA has a formal analysis, called a ``Minimum Equipment List,'' for
each model plane, specifying what can be broken and how long it can
stay that way without disqualifying the plane from flying. Planes
can fly without thrust reversers for days.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, then, some experts are skeptical that the
thrust reversers could have played much of a role in the EgyptAir
crash. Boeing officials suggest that because of the Thailand crash,
involving a Lauda Air plane, there is a better chance that the
thrust reversers had nothing to do with the Egyptair crash, since
all operators of 767's made extensive changes to their thrust
reversers to make sure the same thing did not happen to them.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, one expert, in looking at what is known about how
the Egyptian plane fell to the sea, pointed out that it was the
left engine of the EgyptAir plane on which the reverser had been
disabled, and the plane turned right in the last few seconds of
flight, hardly a likely direction if the left engine was pushing
back _ the way a deployed thruster would force it to _ instead of
pulling forward.
</P>
<P>
   Still, experts are ruling out nothing, and everyone acknowledges
that thrust reversers have a curious and problematic recent
history.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The 1991 crash of the Lauda Air 767 was a nasty surprise to the
industry, and it was followed by more surprises. One contributing
cause of that crash was that a sensor to measure the reverser
position was out of adjustment. When the FAA checked 767's in this
country, 90 percent of them had sensors out of adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   Attached to the jet engines of almost every big airliner is a
device called a thrust reverser. On the big twin-engine planes like
the 767, it is an arrangement of doors and vents that redirects the
gases shooting out of the back of the jet, and instead vents them
from the middle of the jet back towards the front in a pattern like
a shower nozzle's, in a broad spray pointed towards the front of
the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Thrust reversers help big jets land on short runways, a
commercial advantage, but they are considered safety devices,
because, among other functions, they assure that a plane can stop
quickly if the pilot needs to abort a takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   The reversers on the 767, though, are different from reversers
on earlier planes with smaller engines, like the 737. One key
difference is that the 767 engine, because it is bigger, is
attached to the wing on a shorter pylon, and when it reverses it
blows gas against the wing, not only providing reverse thrust but
also spoiling the wing's lift.
</P>
<P>
   Thus a deployment in flight, which happened to the Lauda plane,
was what experts call ``unrecoverable,'' or impossible for a pilot
to counter, because the loss of lift made the plane roll upside
down very quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``A technical change occurred that we hadn't properly thought
about,'' said one FAA official Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Three months after the Lauda crash, the FAA ordered all thrust
reversers on 767's disabled. Later that year, Boeing and the FAA
came up with a fix. First, a valve that was supposed to pipe
hydraulic fluid in one direction to deploy the thrust reverser and
in another direction to stow it was replaced by two valves, to
reduce the chance of the valve going bad.
</P>
<P>
   And a locking mechanism, controlled by a separate circuit to the
cockpit, was installed. The lock is invisible to pilots; when they
manipulate the lever on the pedestal between their seats, near the
throttles, they are unlocking the reverser as well as deploying it.
But deployment now needs two electronic signals from the cockpit,
not just one.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines in the United States were required to make the change
by the FAA. Boeing said that all its customers, including
foreign-flag carriers like EgyptAir, did the same. Airlines
commonly follow the manufacturer's advice, out of self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   But the FAA recently proposed two new rules on inspection and
maintenance of thrust reversers on the 767's and other planes. One,
last month, called for changes in the pin used to make reversers
inoperable. The draft rule was issued because of an incident
recently on a 747, which has a different engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aircraft had landed with what appeared to be a partially
deployed thrust reverser, which was supposed to be pinned at the
time,'' said an FAA official. ``But it was not to the point of us
being outrageously concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   But the pin was showing more wear than anticipated, the official
said, who asked not to be identified because the National
Transportation Safety Board, as the agency in charge of the
EgyptAir investigation, bars others from commenting.
</P>
<P>
   The other proposed change would require more frequent
inspections of other parts that have shown more wear, because some
thrust reversers have shed parts in flight and the FAA proposals
are just that: They may never become requirements.
</P>
<P>
   One fear is that parts from a thrust reverser _ like any parts
shed from a plane _ could hit the fuselage or the tail and cause
serious damage. That, too, is a possibility in the EgyptAir flight,
but one of hundreds of possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The cockpit voice recorder could have captured a sound like
that, and the flight data recorder could clear up a lot of those
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guess what, the pinger's working,'' said one aviation expert,
referring to the device that emits a sound to locate a black box.
The 767's black box monitors thrust reverser deployment, he said.
``Hopefully, when we pull that puppy up, everything will be
answered immediately,'' he said.

U.S. PROGRAM AIMED TO MAKE HANOI THINK RELEASED PRISONERS WERE
SPIES, BOOK SAYS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A secret American program was created during the
Vietnam War to frame enemy prisoners as spies and then send them
back to North Vietnam, where they would face possible execution,
according to a new history of covert action during the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In a program begun in 1968 and code-named Project Urgency, some
North Vietnamese soldiers and others held as prisoners by American
forces were handpicked from prisoner-of-war holding areas and sent
back to North Vietnam, either landed by helicopter or dropped by
parachute, the book states.
</P>
<P>
   Incriminating espionage items were hidden in their clothing
without their knowledge, so that when they were picked up by North
Vietnamese security forces, they would appear to be American
agents.
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, ``The Secret War Against Hanoi,'' to be
published next month by HarperCollins, Richard H. Shultz Jr., a
national security historian, says that the program was designed to
make the North Vietnamese believe that America had infiltrated far
more spies into the North than it actually had. The United States
wanted the Communist regime to ``worry about its home front,''
Shultz said in an interview on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In another secret operation run by the Studies and Observation
Group, the military's covert arm during the Vietnam conflict, North
Vietnamese fishermen were kidnapped, blindfolded and taken to an
island off the coast of South Vietnam, where the United States had
created a phony North Vietnamese village, according to the book.
</P>
<P>
   The ruse was designed to convince the fishermen that they had
arrived in the North Vietnamese haven of an anti-Communist rebel
group called the ``Sacred Sword of the Patriots League.'' After
three weeks, they were blindfolded again and returned home, in the
hope that they would spread the word that there was a liberated
area in North Vietnam controlled by rebel forces. About 1,000 North
Vietnamese were kidnapped and secretly brought to the island
between 1964 and 1968, the book states.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on thousands of pages of classified documents and
interviews with many of the participants, Shultz's book also states
that President John F. Kennedy had urged the CIA to launch
guerrilla operations against North Vietnam almost immediately after
taking office in 1961. The request came at his first National
Security Council meeting on Jan. 28, 1961, the book states.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's initiative led to nearly a decade of covert operations
in Vietnam and Laos that spawned troubling actions by American
troops in the field and bitter interagency feuds back in
Washington, while failing to turn the tide of the battle.
</P>
<P>
   The actions of the military's covert arm during the Vietnam war
became a renewed topic of debate last year after a CNN report
alleged that nerve gas was used during a secret U.S. military
operation in 1970 to assassinate American defectors in Laos.
Confronted with overwhelming evidence that the broadcast was wrong,
CNN subsequently disavowed the story.
</P>
<P>
   Shultz, director of the international security studies program
at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, is completing a study
of the controversy surrounding CNN's ``Operation Tailwind'' report
for the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public
Policy at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   With the cooperation of the U.S. Army Special Operations
Command, which he obtained while previously on the faculty at West
Point, he began his own history of Vietnam-era covert operations
long before the CNN account was broadcast. He now argues that,
while the CNN story was false, the historical record does raise
some troubling questions about actions of the military's covert arm
during the war.
</P>
<P>
   In Project Urgency, for example, Shultz found that the
military's covert arm understood that it was sending North
Vietnamese POW's to face possible death in their homeland. Lt. Col.
Robert McKnight, who was a key officer in the covert group in 1968,
is quoted in Shultz's book as saying that it ``was hoping they'd
all be killed or give false information that we planted.'' It is
unclear how many POWs were sent back to North Vietnam through the
operation, Shultz said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Project Urgency, the military's covert group also
created Project Borden, through which North Vietnamese POWs were
recruited, this time supposedly as willing agents, to return to the
North. They were fed false information, however, about how to make
contact with nonexistent guerrilla teams, according to the book, in
order to make the North Vietnamese believe that there were
guerrillas operating throughout the North.
</P>
<P>
   But both Borden and Urgency were just gearing up when President
Lyndon Johnson, seeking to conduct peace talks with the North
Vietnamese, ordered a halt to such operations in late 1968.
</P>
<P>
   For the remainder of the war, the military's covert group
focused primarily on efforts to interdict North Vietnamese supply
shipments along the Ho Chi Minh trail in Laos, the book shows.

IAN BANNEN, 71, WHOSE CAREER SPANNED O'NEILL AND `NED DEVINE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ian Bannen, who scored a film triumph late in his career as a
charming con man in the 1998 hit comedy ``Waking Ned Devine,'' died
Wednesday in a car crash in his native Scotland. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred near Loch Ness while Bannen was taking a
short break from his latest role in a film provisionally entitled
``Strictly Sinatra,'' said his agent, Jean Diamond.
</P>
<P>
   Bannen's body was found in an overturned automobile near Loch
Ness, said a police spokesman. His wife, Marilyn, who was driving
the car, was flown by air ambulance to a nearby hospital. Her
injuries were not immediately known, the police added.
</P>
<P>
   In the whimsical ``Ned Devine,'' the comic capstone of Bannen's
long career in English and Irish theater, in films and onstage on
both sides of the Atlantic and on television, Bannen and David
Kelly portrayed the aging Irishmen who attempt to con the tiny
village of Tulaigh Mohr (or Tully More) into claiming a lottery
jackpot for themselves after the actual winner, Ned Devine,
perishes from shock.
</P>
<P>
   Bannen's film career, which stretched across more than 40 years,
included roles in ``Braveheart'' (1995), ``Hope and Glory'' (1987),
``Gorky Park'' (1983), ``Gandhi'' (1982), ``Eye of the Needle''
(1981) and ``The Flight of the Phoenix'' (1966), in which his
performance as one of the men stranded in the Sahara beside their
downed plane earned him an Academy Award nomination for best
supporting actor.
</P>
<P>
   As an actor, he ranged from roles in plays by Shakespeare and
O'Neill to a leper in Mel Gibson's Academy Award-winning
`Braveheart'' and a foxy grandpa in John Boorman's ``Hope and
Glory.'' In the early 1960s, Bannen was a member of the Royal
Shakespeare Company during its initial season in Stratford-on-Avon.
He appeared on the London stage in 1958 in O'Neill's ``Iceman
Cometh'' and ``Long Day's Journey into Night'' and in an acclaimed
1983 revival of `A Moon for the Misbegotten.''
</P>
<P>
   His television credits included ``Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy''
and ``The Politician's Wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Bannen, who was born in Airdrie, Scotland, on June 29, 1928, was
the only son of a lawyer. He served as a corporal in the army
before making his stage debut in 1947 in Dublin in ``Armlet of
Jade.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife.

BAFFERT FIGURES HE CAN'T WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ Somebody has finally had enough of the Bob
Baffert hype leading up to Saturday's Breeders' Cup at Gulfstream
Park.
</P>
<P>
   It's Baffert himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I hear, `You should win four (races),' `You should
win five,' '' the trainer said Wednesday. ``I don't want to hear
that. It takes all the fun out of it. If I win two, then they'll
say, `He (begin ital)only(end ital) won two.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Tell it to the morning-line maker.
</P>
<P>
   After the eight Breeders' Cup races took shape Wednesday,
Gulfstream handicapper Chuck Streva released a morning line in
which Baffert horses are favored to win three.
</P>
<P>
   Streva makes Silverbulletday 5-2 in the Distaff, which opens the
program; Chilukki 8-5 in the Juvenile Fillies; and Forest Camp 3-1
in the Juvenile. He also made Baffert's General Challenge (4-1) and
River Keen (6-1) contenders in the Classic, in which Jim
Bond-trained Behrens is a 3-1 favorite.
</P>
<P>
   (The morning line is, of course, only a forecast. Official odds
will be determined Saturday by the wagering patterns here and
around the country.)
</P>
<P>
   The line does offer some support, though, for Baffert's
complaint. Except for heavily favored Chilukki, none of the
Breeders' Cup favorites is lower than 5-2, reflecting unusual
parity at the top of a sport in which public choices win one-third
of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Other favorites: 7-2 Brave Act in the Mile, 7-2 Artax in the
Sprint, 7-2 Soaring Softly in the Filly and Mare Turf and 7-2
Daylami in the Turf.
</P>
<P>
   David Flores will ride two of Baffert's favorites, and Jerry
Bailey and Jorge Chavez will ride two favorites each. Bailey is the
only jockey with assignments in all eight races.
</P>
<P>
   Breeders' Cup Ltd. president D.G. Van Clief Jr. called
Saturday's event ``as competitive a Breeders' Cup as I think we've
ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Every race except the pair for 2-year-olds drew overflow
pre-entries and had to be pared down to the maximum 14 horses
before Wednesday's random draw for post positions.
</P>
<P>
   If racing luck is going to be decisive, Baffert got some early
good news when none of his horses landed worrisome starting slots.
Baffert seemed concerned only about Chilukki, whose No. 3 draw
could force the undefeated filly to go fast early to avoid traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on how they break,'' he said. ``You have to have a
Plan A and a Plan B. If you have to go to Plan C, you're in
trouble.''

   SEATTLE _ A gunman dressed in camouflage, sunglasses and a brown
hat opened fire Wednesday morning at a shipyard building near Lake
Union here, killing two people and wounding two others, police
said. The man then fled, sparking a huge manhunt through north
Seattle during which police advised residents to stay in their
homes and kept children at 20 schools locked inside their buildings
for part of the school day.
</P>
<P>
   The dragnet, with helicopters and police dogs, continued into
the evening. Police said they had no identification of the suspect
and no idea of his motive. Employees at the Northlake Shipyard
shop, where the shooting occurred shortly after 10:30 a.m., said
the man did not work there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He walked in and started shooting,'' said Pam McCammon, a
police spokeswoman. ``That's all we know.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials identified the victims as Russell James Brisendine,
43, and Peter Giles, 26. A spokesman at Harborview Medical Center
said that two other victims were in the hospital, a 58-year-old-man
with serious injuries and a 19-year-old man listed in stable
condition.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings, which occurred one day after seven people were
shot to death in a Xerox Corp. office in Honolulu, were covered
extensively on Seattle local television, with some footage shot
from news helicopters overhead. But, local stations insisted they
had followed guidelines to ensure that their accounts were not
giving the killer, in case he was watching, information about
exactly where and how the police search was being conducted.  &QL;

CAN A STRONG-WILLED CHIEF SHARE POWER IN MERGER? 
</HEADLINE>
  (With DRUG-MERGER) 
(nk) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The planned merger between American Home Products and
Warner-Lambert once again raises the question of whether John R.
Stafford, American Home's famously strong-willed chairman and chief
executive, is capable of sharing and, perhaps more important,
letting go of power.
</P>
<P>
   His latest would-be colleague, Lodewijk J.R. de Vink, is little
known outside the pharmaceutical industry but may well be the best
candidate yet to make a merger with Stafford work.
</P>
<P>
   De Vink, a 54-year-old native of the Netherlands, is younger
than the chief executives of the two companies that American Home
failed to merge with last year, SmithKline Beecham PLC and the
Monsanto Co., creating a more natural succession path for Stafford,
62. Although it has been reported that de Vink would be named chief
executive from the outset, analysts do not expect Stafford to be a
retiring or retired chairman any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he has any intention of being a part-time
employee,'' said Neil B. Sweig of Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co., adding that
Stafford seems fully recovered from a bout with prostate cancer in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   De Vink has plenty of experience working with an aggressive,
high-profile boss. De Vink so impressed Melvin R. Goodes, a
colorful Canadian who had been widely hailed for turning
Warner-Lambert from an also-ran into one of the industry's more
prosperous companies, that Goodes retired and turned the company
over to him in May, a year earlier than Goodes intended.
</P>
<P>
   But if de Vink is green enough as a chief executive to still be
able to benefit from Stafford's expertise and experience, he also
arrives with the kind of ambitions Stafford can easily relate to.
In his 13 years running American Home, Stafford has pushed the
company deep into the prescription drug business from its base in
over-the-counter products like Advil and household products from
spaghetti to oven cleaners. He has not come close to his goal of
becoming No. 1 in the drug industry, but acquisitions of A.H.
Robins and American Cyanamid made rivals sit up and take notice.
</P>
<P>
   De Vink, for his part, has told analysts he wanted
Warner-Lambert to be among the top 25 enterprises in all of
business by the time he retires in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lodewijk has just arrived and is keen to get a running
start,'' said Viren Mehta, founder of the Mehta Group, a New
York-based firm that follows the drug industry. ``He recognizes the
importance of size and wants to address it head on. He's a very
pragmatic, decisive industry veteran.''
</P>
<P>
   De Vink struck his first deal, Warner-Lambert's $2.1 billion
acquisition of Agouron Pharmaceuticals, which makes drugs for
cancer, viral diseases and eye diseases, soon after becoming chief
executive in May.
</P>
<P>
   Before then, though, he was most widely known in the industry as
a marketing expert with a background in international business. He
joined Warner-Lambert as head of its international business in
1988, leaving a similar post at the Schering-Plough Corp. He became
executive vice president and head of American operations in 1990.
In 1991, the year he became a U.S. citizen, he was also promoted to
president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   De Vink served as chairman of the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers Association, the industry's main trade group, in
1995. In a speech to the group, he bluntly warned, ``The changes we
see are so dramatic, so comprehensive and so constant that we no
longer plan in years, but in weeks and months.''
</P>
<P>
   De Vink went on to become active in TransAtlantic Business
Dialogue, an organization of senior European and American business
executives dedicated to reducing trade barriers. He served as
co-chairman last year with Juergen E. Schrempp, the chairman and
chief executive of DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very quick study who has respect for other people's
experience,'' said Paula Stern, the former head of the
International Trade Commission whose consulting firm, the Stern
Group Inc. in Washington, has advised the TransAtlantic group.
</P>
<P>
   De Vink has sometimes been described as chatty and diplomatic,
two terms that are not commonly applied to the intense Stafford,
who became chief executive of American Home in 1986. Stafford had
joined the company in 1970 as chief counsel and risen through its
ranks as a financial expert.
</P>
<P>
   A former football player at Dickinson College in his native
Pennsylvania, Stafford practiced law in Washington from 1962 to
1966 and worked at Hoffman-LaRoche for four years before joining
American Home.
</P>
<P>
   He has been known both for transforming American Home through
deal-making and keeping a sharp eye on expenses. In his early days,
Stafford was regarded as unusually open compared with others in the
industry. But as he rose in influence, he became more guarded. He
once went six years without meeting with Wall Street analysts. Some
analysts noted that if the merger with Warner-Lambert went through,
that would be one task most likely to go immediately to de Vink.

3 CULTURAL OFFICIALS DEFEND ACTIONS OF BROOKLYN MUSEUM
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a joint letter Wednesday, three executives of
cultural institutions in the city defended the Brooklyn Museum of
Art's decision to finance its controversial ``Sensation''
exhibition in part by soliciting substantial donations from
companies and individuals with a direct commercial interest in the
artwork on display.
</P>
<P>
   Such fund-raising practices are common and pose no ethical
problems so long as museum directors are careful not to allow the
donations to compromise their artistic judgments, the letter
stated. ``If there were any evidence that a museum had compromised
its mission and its professional judgment because of the demands of
current or potential sponsors, then there would be a criticism to
make here,'' the executives wrote. ``But not a shred of such
evidence has appeared.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter was signed by Karen Brooks Hopkins, president of the
Brooklyn Academy of Music, Betsy Gotbaum, president of the New York
Historical Society, and Alan J. Friedman, director of the New York
Hall of Science and chairman of the city's Cultural Institutions
Group. All three said the letter reflected only their views, not
those of their organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the city, however, signaled their intent Wednesday
to closely examine the financial arrangements behind ``Sensation,''
an exhibition of contemporary British art that Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani has condemned as offensive and sacrilegious. In a court
hearing in Brooklyn, Leonard Koerner, the chief assistant
corporation counsel, told Judge Nina Gershon of U. S. District
Court that the city needed two months to complete ``extensive
discovery'' into the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Gershon granted the request, but she also ordered the city to
immediately pay nearly $1 million in city subsidies that Giuliani
had withheld to punish the museum for going forward with
``Sensation.'' In doing so, Gershon rejected the city's request to
place the money in escrow while it appealed her temporary
injunction, issued on Monday, forbidding the mayor from penalizing
the museum in any way. The judge ruled that the mayor's campaign to
evict the museum and cut its public financing constituted a clear
violation of the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The letter from the three cultural executives was written in
response to an article in The New York Times on Sunday that
described, among other things, how top officials at the Brooklyn
Museum of Art concealed a $160,000 donation from Charles Saatchi,
the owner of the ``Sensation'' collection, and how they offered
Christie's, for a $50,000 donation, special access to the museum to
entertain clients who frequently buy contemporary art.

   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ Too much baseball?
</P>
<P>
   It might be an alien concept to Yankee fans still giddy from the
World Series, but a proliferation of baseball businesses with more
on the way is producing a weary sense of overload in this town best
known for the venerable Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had always managed to keep this balance between baseball
and our natural ambience, but the balance has tipped,'' said Polly
Renckens, executive director of the Chamber of Commerce. ``We're
really at a crossroads.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame, officially the National Baseball Hall of Fame
and Museum, was one thing. Its brick home is so subdued and
tasteful that tourists often ask how to find it as they stand in
front of it.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few years, baseball has taken over Main Street
and has spread along the roads into and out of the village. And
while most of America may consider Cooperstown synonymous with
diamond glory, that is not how Cooperstown sees itself. Residents
say they want to enjoy their peaks and lakes in peace, and many
wish that visitors were as passionate about James Fenimore Cooper,
whose father founded this village and who set two of his
Leatherstocking Tales here, as they are about Hank or Ty or the
Babe.
</P>
<P>
   The hardware store has been replaced by a memorabilia shop
called Mickey's Place, which promises to replace ``the baseball
cards your mother threw away.'' The pharmacy is now America's Game,
with Derek Jeter necklaces. The former cinema is Seventh Inning
Stretch, the place to buy Nolan Ryan steak sauce and Yankees
fishing lures. The bank has become the American Baseball
Experience, the home of virtual-reality batting cages.
</P>
<P>
   In the window of Augur's Book Store is not ``The Deerslayer,''
but ``Curious George Plays Baseball'' and ``The Bat Pack.'' A local
brewery sells Strike Out Stout and Benchwarmer Porter.
</P>
<P>
   It all crept up like a sneaky steal, and nobody said much. That
just changed. Capitalizing on the Cooperstown magic, Eddie Einhorn,
vice chairman of the Chicago White Sox, has filed plans to build a
fantasy baseball camp five miles from the Hall of Fame. He said he
hoped to open it next summer and expected to draw a total of 1,500
young players and coaches during 10 weeklong sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The camp, Cooperstown Baseball World, is to be built on what is
now a strawberry field and pumpkin patch, and would adjoin
Cooperstown Dreams Park, a similar operation that opened in 1996. A
third camp has been proposed nearby, and a fourth is rumored to be
in development. The camps are provoking wide and loud opposition,
and are causing village leaders to re-examine their relationship
with baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Wendell Tripp, 71, said ruefully that if today's average
visitor were asked about Hawkeye, a character in ``The Last of the
Mohicans,'' ``They'd think you were talking about MASH.''
</P>
<P>
   Some local leaders complain that baseball tourists, in contrast
with resortgoers, are simply not their sort. ``They're more
inclined to stay overnight 60 miles away, where they can get a room
for half price, and maybe stop at McDonald's on the way out,'' said
Jessie A. Ravage, a historical research consultant who led a
successful drive to get the area listed on the National Register of
Historic Places.
</P>
<P>
   Henry S.F. Cooper Jr., 65, a science writer who is a
great-great-grandson of the novelist, said Cooperstown Dreams Park,
with its huge influx of parents, players and coaches, is ``like
having a military base in your area.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he feared that the camps would spawn ``chain things;
major inns, video game parlors, amusement parks, you name it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooperstown, a village of 2,200, is a quaint time capsule about
200 miles northwest of New York City, with rows of Victorian
mansions and a thriving opera. In summer, big terra-cotta pots of
geraniums hang from the gas-light-style street lights on Main
Street, and in fall the poles are surrounded by cornstalks and
accented by pumpkins.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Historians now discount the notion that baseball, probably a
descendant of an English game called rounders, was invented here by
Abner Doubleday in 1839. Whatever the game's origins, Cooperstown
has had a prickly relationship with it since long before the Hall
of Fame opened in 1939. In ``William Cooper's Town,'' a history
that won the Pulitzer Prize in 1996, Alan Taylor wrote that in 1816
the village enacted an ordinance declaring that ``no person shall
play at Ball in Second or West street, in this village, under a
penalty of $1.'' Taylor wrote that the trustees were acting against
townball, a bat-and-ball game that evolved into baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters will come to Cooperstown Baseball World as teams,
whether Little League, recreation league or club teams, and most
will be 11 and 12, Einhorn said, adding that he planned to have two
former major league stars at camp each week.
</P>
<P>
   An opposition group has three lawyers looking for ways to stop
Einhorn. Some parents gave out fliers opposing the camp when their
children went trick-or-treating last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Einhorn is pushing ahead with his application for
a state environmental review. He said he was being punished over
dissatisfaction with the earlier park, and said he hoped to
overcome objections by controlling lights and noise, and by
planning evening activities so that the players don't annoy
residents of Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Einhorn said he planned to make an announcement of Cooperstown
Baseball World in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a soap opera up there,'' Einhorn, 63, said from his
home in Alpine, N.J. ``It's a whole complicated story of trouble in
paradise. We're trying to stay out of it as best we can.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The earlier camp, Cooperstown Dreams Park, draws 800 youngsters
each week for 11 weeks during the summer. They play in tournaments
on 10 lighted diamonds with eight-foot-high fences, and sleep in 62
bunkhouses with mattresses featuring a sports motif. All
participants receive a ring, regardless of finish.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the the-more-the-merrier stance of attractions in
places like Orlando, Fla., the Hall of Fame is not rolling out the
red carpet for Einhorn. Jeff Idelson, the Hall of Fame's vice
president of communications, said that before taking a position,
officials wanted to determine whether the environment and the roads
could handle ``something of that magnitude.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the quality of life is degraded, we all lose forever, and
forever is a long time,'' Idelson said.

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - Lynda Bertelson Jensen, who was 53, died alone in her
home in Tempe about a month ago. She was a mother and grandmother,
a sister, an aunt. She'd been in Arizona for several years working
as a pharmacist. She had friends here, and co-workers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Her obituary didn't appear in The Ari zona Republic, however. As
far as mem bers of her family are concerned, Lynda's death notice
already had been printed in the paper. It ran Sept. 27 on Page B1
un der a headline reading:
</P>
<P>
   ``Druggist trails record of addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   The focus of that story was Lynda Jen sen. Tempe police say not
long after it was printed, she killed herself. Tests are being done
to determine the exact day.
</P>
<P>
   Police say a note Lynda left behind specifically mentioned the
article, which was written by reporters Susie Steckner and Jodie
Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   I spoke briefly with Lynda's sister, Judy, this week. She told
me, ``It's your paper's fault, and if that makes you guys feel
good, that's wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't make anyone feel good.
</P>
<P>
   It's not wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   RECORDS LED TO ARTICLE
</P>
<P>
   The reporters came upon Jensen's story while researching a
lawsuit filed by technicians against some of the pharmacists at NCS
Healthcare. They studied records at the state Board of Pharmacy on
those named in the suit. Jensen was one of them. She'd had drug
problems for years. They were outlined in detail in the newspaper
article. I won't list them again.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen said in the story, ``It's all very upsetting to me. I
have nothing to say.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Pharmacy Association op erates a support program for
members with an addiction. Lisa Yates, who coor dinates the
program, knew Jensen.
</P>
<P>
   ``She left a message on my recorder the morning the story came
out,'' Yates said. ``She said she was not going to be where she was
supposed to be that day. That was the last contact I had with
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Jensen, who also suffered from depres sion, didn't return any of
the calls Yates and others made to her that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all aware this would affect her,'' Yates said. ``When
a person is in recovery, they're not happy with them selves anyway.
I only wish more people understood addiction. She wasn't a terri
ble person. She was a person who had problems and was working on
those prob lems. She just didn't want the whole world to know about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Who would?
</P>
<P>
   A newspaper must do stories like this to protect the public. In
this case, you needed to know how the state Pharmacy Board handles,
or doesn't handle, the po tential danger an impaired pharmacist
poses to the public.
</P>
<P>
   So, the worst part of Lynda Jensen's life became the biggest
part, the only part, of a story in The Republic.
</P>
<P>
   NO CONSUMER COMPLAINTS
</P>
<P>
   The other parts of her life _ some of them, anyway _ appeared in
an obituary printed recently in the Billings (Mont) Gazette.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was raised in Billings and gradu ated from Billings High
School,'' it read. ``She went on to graduate with a degree in
pharmacy from the University of Utah in 1969.''
</P>
<P>
   It goes on to say Lynda was married that same year, and had two
children, a boy and a girl. Lynda's daughter recently became a
mother. Lynda never saw her new grandchild. There's more to know
about her, of course, but the family isn't interested in telling
anyone who works where I work. Not now.
</P>
<P>
   After her death, Pharmacy Board Presi dent Dennis McAllister
sent an e-mail to the paper saying his board ``has an excel lent
record of protecting the public from deficient practitioners and
views Lynda's case as one of failure because we were not able to
help Lynda return to a sober lifestyle while maintaining her chosen
profession. It is important to note that never was Lynda the
subject of a con sumer complaint, and she had no record of
misfilled prescriptions. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Her obituary in Billings ended this way: ``Lynda was a brilliant
and talented woman. She knocked on God's Door, and he welcomed her
with open arms. Fare well, Lynda, we love and will miss you.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: A CHALLENGE TO YUGOSLAVIA  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Nov. 4:
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has signaled an important and welcome
change in its policy on economic sanctions against Serbia. Hoping
to strengthen the democratic opposition to Yugoslavia's president,
Slobodan Milosevic, Washington now says it will ease its
restrictions on commerce and travel as soon as Milosevic submits
himself to free and fair elections. Previously the administration
said these sanctions would continue as long as Milosevic remained
in power.
</P>
<P>
   There are risks to this new approach. Milosevic, though
unpopular, might still prevail in free elections by playing off the
divisions among his chronically fragmented opposition. But the
chance is worth taking. If anybody is going to rid European
politics of Milosevic, his wars and his ethnic persecutions, it
will be the Serbian people, who should now recognize that his
leadership has repeatedly brought them moral and military disaster.
</P>
<P>
   With its new policy, Washington gives encouragement to Serbian
opposition parties and sends exactly the right message to the
Serbian people. The main purpose of sanctions all along has been to
discredit and weaken Milosevic by making it difficult for his
government to sustain jobs and incomes and provide the European
amenities Serbia enjoyed in earlier years. The White House also
hoped that economic pressure would take a toll on the military and
police forces that Milosevic has used for ethnic and political
repression.
</P>
<P>
   But with the prospect that sanctions might continue for many
years to come, Belgrade could contend that they amounted to unjust
and permanent punishment of the entire Serbian nation. Now
Washington can fairly argue that the sanctions will eventually
benefit all Serbs if they compel Milosevic to let them choose their
government.
</P>
<P>
   To make it even clearer that Washington is not out to punish
ordinary Serbs, the administration should build on its recent
decision to accept a European plan to provide winter heating oil to
two Serbian cities. Oil should be made available to all Serbian
households. It is a form of humanitarian relief and never should
have been included in the ban on aid aimed at rebuilding factories,
bridges and roads hit by NATO bombers in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions are generally most effective when they have a clear
and specific goal and target their punishment as clearly as
possible on those who have the power to bring about the desired
change. By linking the sanctions against Serbia to free elections
and by limiting the pain inflicted on innocent parties, Washington
will improve its chances of forcing Milosevic from office. &QL;

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Americans spent more than they earned in September.
Meanwhile, the personal savings rate was 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The new Commerce Department statistics, published this week,
were a post-Halloween horror story for anyone worried about
financial security.
</P>
<P>
   These overview statistics, we know, aren't one-size-fits-all.
Some families pay their kids' college tuition from trust funds.
Some families plunk down cash for towering sport-utility vehicles
and luxury sedans. Some families outfit themselves at Nordstrom's.
</P>
<P>
   Want it? Buy it. No problem.
</P>
<P>
   But most working families aren't in that cushy spot. They're on
a budget. They make choices. They do without. They agonize over 4
percent annual raises (if they're lucky). They keep barely, just
barely, ahead of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In many jobs, it doesn't matter how hard you work or how well
you do. You're not on commission. You don't get a cut from your
sales rep's efforts. There's no pay-for-performance bonus.
</P>
<P>
   You make a set wage or salary and that's it, unless you're paid
for overtime hours. Even then, there's a drawback, a quality of
life trade-off for overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Longer hours at work steal time from home, family and leisure.
And what little free time is available often is spent in front of
the television, where consumerism and the lifestyles of the rich
and famous reign.
</P>
<P>
   Then the old car conks out. The daughter needs braces. The water
heater dies. You dig into your limited savings. You charge it to a
credit card.
</P>
<P>
   You vow that next year _ or the year after that _ you'll get
into your employer's employee stock ownership plan. You'll
contribute to a holiday savings account. But right now you can't
afford to deduct a dime from your paycheck. You need it to live
today.
</P>
<P>
   True picture?
</P>
<P>
   For many, it is. The struggle to maintain a certain quality of
life on a set amount of money invades house after house, forcing
finances to be a factor in most decisions. Living from paycheck to
paycheck is a Sisyphean burden, always keeping the prospect of
prosperity out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, economic reality threatens the potential joy of work.
Workers are forced to decide if the job pays enough to pay the
bills. Money becomes the motivator for choosing or staying in a job
_ not whether you love what you do.
</P>
<P>
   Responsible breadwinners may say that life is hard, life's not
fair, nobody promised you a rose garden, buck up, quit complaining,
carry on. Those are accurate observations and reasonable advice.
</P>
<P>
   But bless those who see their work as more than drudgery.
</P>
<P>
   Bless those who work for money _ yes _ but also for joy.
</P>
<P>
   Bless those who don't measure professional pride and success by
bank account size or conspicuous consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Bless those who know that frugality is not poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Bless those who pay their bills on time, not just because they
can, but because they choose to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Bless those who work for the good they can do rather than the
wealth they can amass.
</P>
<P>
   Bless those who save.
</P>
<P>
   And bless those who share their blessings.

RODRIGUEZ, NOT GRIFFEY, MAY LEAD MAJORS IN TRADE OFFERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Ken Griffey Jr. ranks among the game's greatest players
and may break Hank Aaron's career home run record _ he needs two to
reach 400, 358 to surpass Aaron _ the market for his services could
be surprisingly thin, affected by his apparent intention to test
free agency after the 2000 season and the glut of star players
available for trade this off-season.
</P>
<P>
   As good as Griffey is, many baseball executives view him as the
second most attractive player available _ behind shortstop Alex
Rodriguez, his Seattle teammate _ and unaffordable to the vast
majority of teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just aren't that many people who could put together a
deal for the guy,'' one general manager said. ``And why would you
trade a package of players when you don't know if Griffey is going
to stay with you?''
</P>
<P>
   Another executive, who does not expect his team to be involved
in the bidding, said, ``I'd probably have to give up my Triple-A
affiliate and my Double-A affiliate to get him, and there's no
guarantee this guy is going to take you to the promised land.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle officials have indicated they would like at least four
very good players in return for Griffey, who has turned down an
eight-year, $135 million offer and requested a trade on Monday.
Given those parameters, some executives and agents speculated on a
list of suitors for Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey has said he wants to be traded close to his home in
Orlando, Fla., although he doesn't seem to have any interest in
playing for the Florida Marlins or the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. In
other words, ``I want to be close to my family, but as long as I
can play on a good team.''
</P>
<P>
   That being the case, the Atlanta Braves would seem to be a
natural fit for Griffey. The Braves are contenders; they could
build a deal for Griffey around their own center fielder, Andruw
Jones. But rival executives believe that if the Braves put together
a package for any available player, their preference will be
Rodriguez; the Braves, after all, need a shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds are the first team to indicate publicly that they will
pursue Griffey, who grew up in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're interested,'' general manager Jim Bowden said Wednesday.
``We're going to do everything we can to see if we can't be a
player in this.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Reds do piece together an acceptable deal for
Griffey _ they could deal pitchers Brett Tomko and Scott
Williamson, center fielder Mike Cameron and others _ they will then
face a daunting task of re-signing Griffey despite their
middle-market status. The Reds had a payroll of $35 million last
season, and Griffey's salary may eventually reach $20 million a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers, some executives said, might be the best
fit for a trade. Pat Gillick, Seattle's new general manager, is the
former boss to Kevin Malone, the Dodgers' GM; the two have a strong
relationship and trade dialogue would come easily. The Dodgers can
piece together a package that includes right fielder Raul Mondesi
and pitchers Chan Ho Park and Darren Dreifort.
</P>
<P>
   But one National League official believes strongly that the
Dodgers will not be seriously involved in the bidding for Griffey.
``How much is too much?'' the official said of the Dodgers'
payroll, about $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles isn't exactly close to Orlando and wouldn't seem to
meet Griffey's requirement for being close to Florida. ``Yeah, and
I remember how Kevin Brown said he wanted to be close to home,
too,'' a baseball official said. ``Then the Dodgers gave him access
to a jet and Florida didn't seem so far away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers must also determine if they can afford three players
earning $11 million to $20 million a season: Brown, outfielder Gary
Sheffield and eventually Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees have the wherewithal to swap for Griffey,
but Griffey has whined about how the principal owner, George
Steinbrenner, was mean to him when he was a kid and trying to play
in the clubhouse at Yankee Stadium during his father's Yankee days.
With Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera not signed to long-term deals,
Bernie Williams locked into a seven-year contract and the Yankees
facing questions about their pitching, it would seem foolhardy to
unload top prospects for Griffey when he wouldn't necessarily
improve them.
</P>
<P>
   But with Steinbrenner, you never know.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets could put together a deal wrapped around
pitcher Octavio Dotel, and general manager Steve Phillips indicated
Wednesday that he could afford to take on another major salary, in
addition to those of Mike Piazza ($13 million), Al Leiter ($8
million) and Robin Ventura ($8 million). But like the Braves, the
Mets would probably prefer Rodriguez over Griffey, if they had to
make a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips added that the Mets need to be cognizant of what the
Braves are doing, to maintain the competitive balance between the
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland has its own potential free-agent headache after next
season, with right fielder Manny Ramirez looking for an annual
salary of $18 million. John Hart, the Indians' general manager,
could simply swap Ramirez and others for Griffey (and others),
trading one headache for another in the hope Griffey could take the
Indians further than Ramirez did, if only for one season.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has demonstrated a willingness to spend money, but with
Steve Finley coming off a strong season in center field, and given
the Diamondbacks' need for a shortstop, Rodriguez makes a whole lot
more sense for them than Griffey. &QL;

BUSH OFFENDS INDIANS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American Indian leaders say Texas Gov. George W.
Bush misconstrued 200 years of constitutional law when he asserted
that state law takes precedence in such Indian issues as gaming.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in Syracuse, N.Y., four weeks ago for a fund-raiser for
his Republican presidential campaign, was quoted in the Syracuse
(N.Y.) Post-Standard as saying, ``My view is that state law reigns
supreme when it comes to the Indians, whether it be gambling or any
other issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Allen, first vice president of the National Congress of
American Indians, said Wednesday, Nov. 3rd, that he did not think
that Bush's remark was a slip of the tongue, but rather a political
calculation.
</P>
<P>
   When contacted Wednesday, Nov. 3rd, the Bush campaign did not
attempt to clarify the remark.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he becomes the president, then he has to uphold the
Constitution, and I think his lawyers will teach him really fast
that this political view cannot be advanced as a matter of
policy,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could cost him a lot of votes.''
</P>
<P>
   There are about 1 million eligible voters in the Native American
population, on and off the reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Some tribal leaders said they were deeply insulted that Bush
would seem to overlook numerous treaties, along with years of court
rulings and executive orders affording tribes the protection of
sovereign governments.
</P>
<P>
   In many treaties, the United States also pledged to make
provisions for Indian health and education, in exchange for taking
over a significant portion of land in North America once held by
the tribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strongly stand on sovereignty to run our government, just
like the states and different countries,'' said Bernadine Boyd,
president of the Fort McDowell Indian Community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably need to educate him (Bush),'' Boyd said. ``It's
kind of unfortunate it became misconstrued.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwen Carr, a Cayuga Indian who is executive director of the
Arizona Democratic Party, said Bush's remark could cost him in the
Arizona GOP primary in February.
</P>
<P>
   She said the state counts about 275,000 Indians as residents.
The Navajo Nation, whose reservation is in Arizona and New Mexico,
is fond of saying that it commands at least one electoral vote all
by itself because of its size.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a presidential candidate to say that state law reigns
supreme when it comes to Indians, it's obvious he fell asleep in
history at school and really doesn't know the issue at all,'' Carr
said. ``For him to say that in New York, or any other state where
there are sovereign nations within their borders, is insulting.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyd said she was not writing Bush off, and would invite him to
meet with Arizona's Indian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Fort McDowell Community is hosting a dinner
featuring Ernestine Bradley, wife of Democratic presidential
candidate Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have Democrats and Republicans and the Reform Party (on the
reservation),'' Boyd said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said Wednesday, Nov. 3rd, that
the remark came in response to a question about Indian land claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush believes the states should have the opportunity
to work out a fair settlement with Indian tribes without
interference from the federal government,'' McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's response included a reference to Indian gaming.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Bush and the Tigua Indians have been battling in court
over the state's efforts to shut down slot machines and card games
on the El Paso reservation. The tribe says its rights are being
trampled.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, who is also chairman of the Jamestown S'Kallam Tribe in
Washington state, said, ``The support so far is leaning more
towards John McCain because he is firm in his beliefs about tribes'
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator is Bush's rival for the Republican
presidential nomination and a former chairman of the Senate Indian
Affairs Committee. McCain has argued that states should not legally
be able to unilaterally block tribal casinos by refusing to
negotiate in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's pro-Indian positions have often placed him at odds with
many governors, including Bush and former Arizona Gov. Fife
Symington, who tried to stop the proliferation of Indian casinos.
</P>
<P>
   McCain spokesman Dan Schnur said McCain has defended Indian
rights ``to make decisions for themselves as to the best use of
their land and its resoures.'' &QL;

MRS. CLINTON PREPARES FOR RESIDENCY AND CAMPAIGNING
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RYE, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton said Wednesday that she had
cleared her schedule of most first lady obligations after Jan. 1 so
she could spend the ``majority of my time'' campaigning for the
Senate next year. Her new house now officially in hand, Mrs.
Clinton said she would establish herself as a New York resident as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to be a registered voter and taxpaying citizen of New
York _ just as soon as I can,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``We'll start
doing whatever we have to do to make that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   After a women's conference and a news conference here, Mrs.
Clinton set off for an unscheduled visit to the $1.7 million home
in Chappaqua that she and President Clinton officially purchased on
Monday night. Mrs. Clinton, who has not owned a home in 17 years,
spent an hour touring the house with aides and a carpenter and
discussing, among other things, decorating ideas. They also ate
lunch _ a turkey sandwich for her and pizza for her aides _ in her
new kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's remarks about her new home settled a number of
questions about how the Clintons would make the transition from
Washington to Westchester in the year ahead. But her vague
responses to some queries served, as well, to reinforce just how
complicated a situation Mrs. Clinton is in as she attempts to
become the first sitting first lady to run for public office.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said that the new home would be ``my primary
residence,'' but made no mention of her spouse. Asked if the home
would be a primary residence for the president as well, she
responded: ``That's a good question. I haven't really talked to him
about that. But you know, I will be declaring it my primary
residence, and I'll have to talk to him about that.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart later said he was uncertain
of the president's exact plans, other than that he intended to
split his time, after leaving the White House, between Little Rock
and Chappaqua.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton also said that she would register to vote as a New
Yorker and begin paying taxes to the state that she hopes to
represent in the U.S. Senate. She currently votes and pays taxes in
Arkansas. But she said she was unsure about how, or when, she might
begin paying New York taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, the Clintons would have to pay state income
taxes of up to 6.85 percent if they filed jointly as a married
couple and spent more than 183 days in the state within a calendar
year. But Mrs. Clinton could be liable for pro-rated income taxes
based on the number of months she was a New York resident this year
in the event that security renovations on her new home were
completed by the end of December and she was able to move in.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is Mr. Clinton _ and not Mrs. Clinton, who described
herself Wednesday as a ``full-time volunteer'' _ who brings in the
bulk of the income for the couple. His annual salary is $200,000,
and the presidential blind trust last year produced just over
$200,000 in income.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Clintons' New York State tax liability could be
limited if Mrs. Clinton declared herself a full-time New York
resident and the president did not. Jim Kennedy, a spokesman for
the White House counsel's office, said he could not elaborate on
the Clintons' plans beyond what Mrs. Clinton said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she would pay New York taxes this year or next, Mrs.
Clinton responded: ``We'll do whatever our accountant tells us
we're supposed to do, and I don't know those rules. I haven't
looked into that.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that she and her husband would spend as much time in
New York as possible, adjusting their living habits to mirror those
of past presidents who kept primary residences outside of
Washington. ``We will be moving in and spending whatever time we
can here in our house,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The date of the move, she said, was a function mostly of when
the Secret Service finished installing security devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily, the house is in great, great shape,'' she said. `I
have to do some work. I have been having a really interesting time,
though, because I have been pulling out all the things that I
haven't been able to use for quite some time. You now, we haven't
had our own house for 16 years, 17 years, I guess. So it's a great
opportunity for us to go through things.''
</P>
<P>
   But she added, ``I'm not going to have a yard sale.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton was relaxed and expansive during her news
conference. Even after her aides sought to cut off the session, she
came back to answer more questions. And when a reporter asked
whether she considered Al Gore an ``alpha-male'' _ a reference to
the disclosure that the vice president had hired a consultant to
counsel him on ways to improve his stature _ the first lady's only
reaction was a long burst of laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has been criticized by some Democrats for spending
so much time outside of the state dealing with White House
business.
</P>
<P>
   She said Wednesday that she was now trying to finish her first
lady duties to make way for her campaign. ``I'm trying to fulfill
my obligations that I already scheduled, or had under way this
year, as much as possible so I will be free come the year 2000 to
spend the vast majority of my time on the Senate campaign,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   On another matter, Mrs. Clinton declined to criticize those of
her supporters, including Rosie O'Donnell, who ridiculed Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, her prospective opponent for the Senate seat,
during a recent fund-raiser.

SPREWELL PUTS HIS GAME FACE ON TO LEAD KNICKS PAST BULLS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Latrell Sprewell slipped into something more
comfortable when he ducked into the locker room at halftime
Wednesday night and emerged with a look more suited for his
personality.
</P>
<P>
   The change in his demeanor looked like the difference between
Muzak and rock 'n' roll. A suddenly inspired Sprewell atoned for
his lethargic and scoreless first half with 15 of his 19 points in
the third quarter to help the New York Knicks pull away and
overcome the Chicago Bulls, 84-74, Wednesday night at the United
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell awoke by hitting his first four shots of the third
quarter. After going 0 for 5 in the first half, he found his edge
and motivation. He turned and snarled when the Bulls' Randy Brown
dared him to score, and he yelled back when a Bulls fan heckled
him. Paced by Sprewell and Allan Houston, who led the Knicks with
23 points, the Knicks were able to turn a close game in the third
quarter into a nonthreat midway through the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   By the time it was over, the Knicks, who shot 47.4 percent, had
overwhelmed the Bulls, who ended the night shooting 30 percent from
the floor. The Bulls, led by Dickey Simpkins' 17 points and Ron
Artest's 14 off the bench, hung close but could not weather the
fourth quarter push by the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed inconceivable for the experienced Knicks to struggle
against a young Bulls team built on the back of No. 1 pick Elton
Brand and the future of promising reserve players like Artest, the
former St. John's star. But the Knicks were the ones who made their
way through the United Center hallways Wednesday night and out to a
court that marked the spot where the team all but flicked a Bic to
light last season's turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   It was here where the Knicks turned in one of the worst
performances in franchise history, a humiliating 76-63 loss last
March to a Jordanless Bulls team that resembled a car on cinder
blocks. That game set in motion six weeks of behind-the-scenes
turmoil that left coach Jeff Van Gundy precariously close to being
fired and resulted in general manager Ernie Grunfeld's being
dismissed from his position on April 21.

CLINTON VETO JUMP-STARTS TALKS WITH GOP ON SPENDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: UPDATES with deal reached on financing Wye accord,
differences remain elsewhere; trims.) 
 (With BUDGET-CAPS) 
(nk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Wednesday vetoed another of
the spending bills passed by Congress, but after speaking with the
two top Republican leaders, he said he was ready to work around the
clock to settle the standoff over the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   There was little progress during the day as the two sides
wrangled over a variety of issues having less to do with how much
money the government will spend than with how it should be spent.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, White House and congressional negotiators
reached agreement to fully finance Clinton's proposals for
underwriting the peace agreement between Israel and Palestine at
$1.8 billion over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   But the meeting broke up at 10 p.m., with the two sides still
far apart on all the remaining issues in a bill to finance foreign
aid and the nation's foreign operations.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said the two sides were still about $600 million apart on
pay for three of Clinton's proposals: debt relief for poor nations
that owe money to international financial institutions, measures
aimed at reducing the threat of unsecured nuclear weapons in the
former Soviet Union and peace operations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The aides said Congress was willing to offer less than $370
million for these programs, and &UR;  &LR; the White House wanted $950
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gone all week with no appreciable movement forward,''
said Rep. David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the
Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Although the agreement to pay for the peace accord was the first
clear sign of a thaw in the budget conflict, the dispute was
continuing with no clear end in sight. The foreign operations bill
will have to be settled before any of the other bills are
negotiated, Republican and Democratic members of Congress said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, White House negotiators said they were
encouraged that House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois and Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi had called Clinton on
Wednesday afternoon in an effort to give the talks a push.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not given up, and neither have they,'' Clinton told
reporters during an appearance in the White House Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   In public, though, the two sides continued to assail each other.
</P>
<P>
   The bill vetoed by Clinton would fund labor, health and
education programs, and would cut spending for most federal
agencies by nearly 1 percent from the levels contained in this
year's appropriations bills. In explaining his veto, Clinton called
the bill ``a catalog of missed opportunities, misguided priorities
and mindless cuts in everything from education to national defense
to the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton suggested that Republicans in Congress were eager to
adjourn for the year and go home, but said he would insist that
they ``do their work first.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans repeated their argument that Clinton and Democrats
in Congress want to spend so much money on foreign aid that they
are endangering the financial stability of the Social Security
system.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ernest Istook, R-Okla., said that Clinton had spent 180
days during his presidency ``on foreign soil,'' and that during
those trips, to 104 countries, the president had proposed a total
of $22 billion in foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course there's no way to give that much money away unless
you did go into the Social Security surplus, which we're not about
to do,'' Istook said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas, said that Clinton ``ought to stick
his passport in the drawer for a while, and certainly remove that
credit card from his pocket when he goes to travel.
</P>
<P>
   But White House officials and Democrats in Congress said foreign
aid was a good investment in the security of the United States.

EDITORIAL: THE SHEPARD CASE VERDICT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Nov. 4:
</P>
<P>
   The killing of Matthew Shepard, a gay college student in Wyoming
who in 1998 was beaten, lashed to a fence and left to die, shocked
Americans by lifting homophobia to a new level of savagery. A jury
has now convicted Aaron McKinney of murder, kidnapping and robbery
in the case, and he could face the death penalty. The other
defendant, Russell Henderson, pleaded guilty to murder and
kidnapping earlier, and is serving two life sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Although McKinney admitted that he had committed the attack, his
lawyers hoped to raise a type of ``gay panic'' defense. In their
opening statements they argued that McKinney was guilty only of
manslaughter because sexual abuse in childhood had caused him to
respond in a rage to the victim's alleged homosexual advances. The
presiding judge, Barton Voigt, rejected that argument as
inadmissible at trial, ruling that it amounted to a
diminished-capacity or temporary-insanity defense, neither of which
is allowed under Wyoming law.
</P>
<P>
   The ``gay panic'' defense has no statutory basis, but it has
been invoked in other cases. Typically, the argument is that the
attacker, stirred by fears that he is himself homosexual, becomes
so offended by what he perceives as a sexual advance that he is
provoked to kill the victim. In other words, the attacker should
not be held fully responsible for acts triggered by his own
homophobia. Excusing violence motivated by prejudice would not be
tolerated in racist attacks against ethnic minorities, and should
not be allowed to stand in cases involving attacks against gays.
</P>
<P>
   Voigt's ruling leaves open the possibility that testimony about
McKinney's childhood sexual abuse could be presented in the penalty
phase of the case. Childhood abuse would clearly be relevant in
sentencing deliberations. But that is quite a different matter from
allowing anti-gay hatred to be employed as an affirmative defense
for criminal acts.

EGYPTAIR FLIGHT CRASH MYSTERY DEEPENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ The mystery of what happened to EgyptAir Flight
deepened Wednesday with the stunning word from investigators that
new radar data shows the plane climbed 8,000 feet back into the
night sky after it had plunged more than three miles from its
cruising altitude at near supersonic speeds.
</P>
<P>
   The bizarre roller-coaster flight path would suggest the crew
was attempting to control the plane as it climbed, though
investigators refused to speculate on that.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 767 climbed back to 24,000 feet, only to dive again
rapidly toward the Atlantic, this time breaking up when it reached
about 10,000 feet. Radar showed what were probably pieces of the
airplane drifting down in the direction of the wind for another 2
minutes and 40 seconds before dropping off radar scopes.
</P>
<P>
   All 217 people aboard the plane were killed.
</P>
<P>
   At a late-night news briefing here Wednesday, investigators with
the National Transportation Safety Board said they need to study
data from the jet's two black boxes to try and piece together the
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   But it could be next week before those boxes are recovered from
nearly 300 feet on the bottom of the Atlantic off Nantucket Island.
A storm that is churning up 22-foot waves in the crash area has
halted most of the recovery operations, though a few pieces of
surface debris was collected Wednesday, including spoiler panels on
the wing, seat cushions, a main wheel, the nose tire and five
passenger emergency slides.
</P>
<P>
   High winds and rough seas are expected to continue through the
weekend, said Navy Capt. Burt March.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has said it needs seas of no more than about eight feet
before they can send out the USS Grapple. That ship is the same one
that used its highly specialized equipment to recover the recover
wreckage of TWA Flight 800 in 1996 and Swiss Air Flight 111 last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Until they have the black boxes, the lack of information will
continue to frustrate investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran aerospace journalists who have covered many crashes said
they could not recall a commercial airliner acting as strangely as
Flight 990 as it made its final wayward journey up and down over
the Atlantic some 30 minutes after taking off from Kennedy Airport
in New York on a flight to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   The new radar data came from the Air Force. Earlier, using
tracking information from civilian radar facilities in Boston, New
York and on Nantucket Island, investigators believed the jet never
climbed after its sudden dive from cruising altitude.
</P>
<P>
   John Clark, deputy director of the NTSB's office of Research and
Engineering, gave this account Wednesday night of what
investigators now believe happened in the final minutes of Flight
990.
</P>
<P>
   A half hour out of Kennedy, flying at 33,000 feet, the Boeing
jet suddenly entered a steep but straight dive, down to 16,700
feet.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, information was lost from the plane's
transponder, which provides information to air traffic controllers
about a plane's altitude. The Air Force radar, though, continued to
track the plane down to 16,000 feet. Early in its 17,000-foot dive,
the plane may have exceeded the speed of sound, though it began to
slow as it neared 16,000 feet. Then the plane, its transponder
still out, climbed back to 24,000 feet, when it began a rapid
descent to 10,000 feet where radar showed multiple targets,
indicating it had broken up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stopped being a flying airplane,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark would not speculate on what kind of event could have
triggered the initial dive, or whether the sudden climb indicated
the pilots were struggling to regain control of the huge jet.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the new radar data, investigators also provided
more detail Wednesday night about the deactivated thrust reverser
on the twin-engine plane.
</P>
<P>
   It was deactivated before the plane left Cairo on the first leg
of its trip to Newark. It then flew to Los Angeles and then to
Kennedy before leaving on its last and fatal leg.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Phillips, the NTSB's chief crash investigator, said the
NTSB is sending someone to Cairo to check the plane's maintenance
records and better understand what prompted maintenance crews to
deactivate the thruster on the plane's left engine.
</P>
<P>
   Information from the plane's flight data recorder, one of the
two black boxes, should tell investigators if a thruster deployed
in flight, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because another 767 crashed in Thailand in 1991 when a thrust
reverser deployed, there has been speculation that may have been
what happened on Flight 990.
</P>
<P>
   But Jim Hall, chairman of the safety board, stressed again at
Wednesday night's briefing, ``We have no evidence at this time that
the thrust reverser system played any role in this accident.''
