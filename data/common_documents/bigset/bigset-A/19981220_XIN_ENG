<HEADLINE> Stern Doubts Entire Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- NBA commissioner David
Stern said it is "virtually inevitable" there will be no NBA
season, a belief he said was based on union chief Billy Hunter's
written analysis of the league's latest proposal for a labor
agreement.
</P>
<P>
In the analysis, which players received yesterday, Hunter
wrote that Stern was telling "only half the story" and that the
"NBA's proposal represents steps backwards from the freedom and
benefits that NBA players have enjoyed under the last and even
earlier collective bargaining agreements."
</P>
<P>
"I think the players have been directed on a tragic
course,"Stern said yesterday from his New York office as he
wrapped up work before leaving for a holiday vacation.
</P>
<P>
"Hunter continues to counsel an intransigent stance on the
assumption the owners will hold the season at any cost. Sadly,
he's going to be wrong. In light of Billy's comments to his
players and the position it represents make cancellation of the
season virtually inevitable."
</P>
<P>
Hunter responded last night to Stern's dire outlook by calling
for more negotiating and less rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
"It's David Stern's decision whether or not to cancle the
season," Huntersaid through an aide. "David is well aware that
the players' association is ready and willing to compromise so
long as there are meaningful negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not interested in raising the level of rhetoric at this
point. I'm interested in meaningful negotiations at this time."
</P>
<P>
There have been no negotiations since last Saturday and it seem
s unlikely there will be anu further bargaining before December
26 at earliest.
</P>
<P>
The two sides remain 4 1/2 percentage points apart on the
amount of league revenue the players are to receive in salaries,
according to sources and the league proposal.

or challenging allied aircraft," he said.

<HEADLINE> NBA All-Star Game Atttracts Little Interest from Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- NBA players hope their
exhibition game tonight in Atlantic City proves to their fans
that they still want to play basketball, and shows the NBA that
there are alternative markets for their product if the league's
172-day lockout doesn't end soon.
</P>
<P>
But in the morning of the game, to be televised on
Showtime,many of the tickets have been sold not to eager NBA
fanss, but to the companies who are sponsoring the game. The
tickets range in price from $25 to $50.
</P>
<P>
Company's tickets will be given away, many to charities, in
order to help fill Convention Hall. Proceeds from the game will
be donated to UNICEF and six other charities in the
Philadelphia-Atlantic City area.
</P>
<P>
The NBA has shown little concern about the possibility that
players agents have found an alternative to the league.
</P>
<P>
"I will them well and I hope no one gets hurt,"NBA
commissioner David Stern said.
</P>
<P>
Sponsors laid out $10,000 to $20,000 for blocks of tickets,
and Showtime reportedly paid at least $750,000 to broadcast the
game.
</P>
<P>
But organizers said today that only about 8,000 of the 12,500
tickets to the game had been sold. Few of those reportedly were
sold to the general public.
</P>
<P>
According to a local press, fewer than 600 tickets had been
sold through Ticketmaster.

WASHINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said
on Saturday to the Arab world in a Ramadan message that the
U.S.-led airstrikes against Iraq serve the interests of the entire
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"We believe this action is in the interests of the Iraqi people
and all the people in the Middle East," Clinton said, referring to
the missile attacks starting on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Islam's holy month of Ramadan which starts this

for the holy month of Ramadan. In the days ahead I hope all
Muslims will consider America's sincere desire to work with all
people in the Middle East to build peace."

"We have the most profound admiration for Islam. Our dispute
is with a leader who threatens Muslims and non-Muslims alike," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were videotaped for broadcast on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said when announcing the strikes Wednesday he wanted to
launch the attack before Ramadan started, although officials have
not ruled out continuing the attacks into the holy month.

The third goal is "to strengthen our engagement with Iraqis who

However, he stressed that "We must not harbor illusions... that
change will come easily or quickly."

"But we should go forward and we will with determination,
working with opposition groups, strengthening the global consensus
for bringing Iraq a government worth of its people," he added.

<P>
LONDON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. troops dug trenches on
Saturday close to the Iraqi border and readied Patriot missile
batteries in the face of possible Iraqi retaliation for U.S. and
British air strikes.
</P>
<P>
"We are in a high state of alert. We have established our
defensive position... we are prepared for any attack," Lieutenant
Colonel Paul Hand, Commander of the U.S. Marine Expeditionary Unit
(MEU) Battalion Landing Team 2-4, was quoted by British media as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"There are over 1,000 marines here... We are here to
demonstrate that we have the capabilities," he added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said more than 20 warships and 200 aircraft,
including 15 B-52 bombers, were deployed in the Gulf region
carrying more than 400 cruise missiles and other bombs.
</P>
<P>
Site Commander of the U.S. Patriot battery, Lieutenant Dan
Kolva, said some five Patriot anti-missile missiles had been
deployed in strategic locations around South West Asia.
</P>
<P>
"We are here as long as we are needed... We are here to deter
aggression... shoot down scuds," Reuters quoted him as saying at
one location.
</P>
<P>
Kolva said that additional Patriots, nicknamed "Scud Busters"
during the 1991 Gulf War, could be rushed to various locations in
the region if needed.
</P>
<P>
Officers stressed that the deployments close to the Iraqi
border were defensive measures.
</P>
<P>
So far Iraq has not responded to three days of relentless
night-time bombings by U.S. and British forces in and around the
region.

<P>
DAMASCUS, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Embassy in Damascus
was stoned Saturday by protesters opposing U.S. and British
military strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Syrians took to the streets and marched to
the U.S. Embassy in Damascus while chanting slogans against the
U.S.and British military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
They raised placards voicing solidarity with the Iraqi people
and denouncing the U.S.-British military operations. Among the
slogans are "Down with the U.S.," "Syrian People with you, our
brothers in Iraq" and "One, One, all the Arab people is one."
</P>
<P>
Several hundreds of the demonstrators, mainly students gathered
in front of the U.S. embassy in Damascus to protest the aggression
against Iraq and the Embassy building, which is believed to be
largely empty, was later stoned.
</P>
<P>
The Embassy guards fired tear gas to disperse the outraging
crowds who surrounded the Embassy for at least ten minutes.
</P>
<P>
local observers say that the large demonstration throughout the
city is seldom seen for years in support for a foreign country and
could not take place without government approval.

<P>
ANKARA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister
designate Bulent Ecevit announced here Saturday that he will
return his mandate for a government formation to President
Suleyman Demirel on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit, also leader of the Democratic Left Party (DSP), the
fourth biggest party in the parliament, said that "I have fixed a
meeting with President Suleyman Demirel at 10:00 local time
(08:00 GMT) on Monday, aimed at returning his mandate for a
government formation."
</P>
<P>
Ecevit was assigned by Demirel to form the 56th coalition
government on December 2 after the former minority government led
by Mesut Yilmaz collapsed for his corruption scandals on November
25.
</P>
<P>
Despite Ecevit's 17-day tour of the political parties in
parliament, his efforts fell short of coming up with a government
formula that could pass a vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
The True Path Party (DYP) Chairwoman Tansu Ciler and the
Republican People's Party (CHP) leader Deniz Baykal had rejected a
proposal for a coalition to be formed by the Motherland Party
(ANAP), the DYP and the DSP and another proposal for the DSP
minority government.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish constitution requires a designated prime minister
to form a new government within 45 days.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said on Saturday that Britain and the United States still
need time to complete their military objectives in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Confirming that four British Tornado warplanes had taken off
from their base and were once again in the air over Iraq, Blair
told reporters that the United States and Britain were "well on
course to meeting our objectives" in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said the allied airstrikes had done very serious damage to
Saddam's air defense systems, command and control systems, missile
production capability, and "particularly serious damage" to the
Iraqi Republican Guard organization.
</P>
<P>
But he also attempted to give some indication of what might
happen when the bombing stopped, saying that a forward strategy
was already under discussion.
</P>
<P>
"As well as the military dimension, we are already in
discussion with our colleagues and allies and partners around the
world as to how we then adopt a forward strategy to make sure
there is stability and containment in the long term," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is without any doubt at all, our desire to see the end of
Saddam Hussein," Blair said.

CAIRO, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
Amman -- Trading activities between Jordan and Iraq came to a
partial halt after trade routes were attacked by the U.S. and
British forces, Egypt's daily Al-Alam Al-Youm reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Measures have been taken by the two countries to limit
cross-border movements and the Iraqi oil exporting was also
affected.
</P>
<P>
Amman is concerned over possible economic difficulties
inflicted by the U.S.-British air strikes against Baghdad as
Jordan depends mainly on the Iraqi oil which is provided to it at
preferential prices under a trade protocol.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait City -- The Kuwaiti Ministry of Trade and Industry
adopted an emergency plan to depend largely on the strategic stock
that can meet Kuwait's needs for six months.
</P>
<P>
The stock seems to be kept intact so far as the commercialists
and traders filled their showcases with commodities in preparation
for the holy month of Ramadhan, Al-Alam Al-Youm newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Ministry is confined to monitoring
fraudulent traders and controlling the prices.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics from the U.S. Department of Commerce show
that the United States imported up to 19.5 million barrels of oil
from Iraq in October compared with 13.8 million barrels in
September.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait City -- The Islamic Development Bank (IDB) approved
about 88 million U.S. dollars to finance new development projects
in its member states, an IDB press release said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain will get 24.3 million dollars to update its power
networks. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) will receive 1 million
dollars for an agricultural project. The rest money will be
allocated to enhance inter-Islamic trade.
</P>
<P>
The Jeddah-based IDB is an international financing
establishment of the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC),
with a capital of around 9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt's budget deficit in the first quarter of the
1998-1999 fiscal year starting July 1 stood at 2.642 billion
Egyptian pounds (777 million U.S. dollars), Egypt's Middle East
News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The total expenditure in the three months amounted to 17.579
billion pounds (5.17 billion dollars), including 14.444 billion
pounds (4.25 billion dollars) of the current expenditure and 3.135
billion pounds (922 million dollars) of the capital expenditure.
</P>
<P>
A monthly report issued by the Central Bank of Egypt said the
total revenues in the period were 14.937 billion pounds (4.39
billion dollars), including 14.318 billion pounds (4.21 billion
dollars) in current revenues and 619 million pounds (182 million

CAIRO, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Iraq requested the Arab League
Saturday to exert efforts to press the United States and Britain
to stop military strikes against it, a league official said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's request was included in a message to Arab League chief
Esmat Abdel-Meguid from Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed
al-Sahhaf, Ahmed Bin Hali, league assistant secretary general, was
quoted by Egypt's Middle East News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf expressed Iraq's appreciation for Abdel-Meguid's
stand demonstrated in his condemnation and rejection of the U.S.
military strikes against Iraq, Bin Hali said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the message was handed over to Abdel-Meguid, who
is on a visit to Italy, by Iraqi Charge D'Affaires in Rome Wassan
al Zahawi.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., supported by the Britain, has fired hundreds of
missiles at Baghdad and other areas in Operation Desert Fox since
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The air strikes have reportedly killed more than 30 Iraqi
civilians and wounded over a hundred others.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League Thursday denounced the U.S. attack as a
unilateral action, which it said will "not help settle the pending
issues" between Iraq and the U.N. Special Commission.
</P>
<P>
The commission is responsible for overseeing the elimination of
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, a must for the U.N. Security
Council to lift the crippling economic sanctions imposed on Iraq
after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

BAGHDAD, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Vice President Taha
Yassin Ramadan said Saturday Baghdad will end all dealings
with the U.N. Special Commmission charged with disarming Iraq
, in response to the American and British air strikes.
</P>
<P>
"The Special Commission is now behind us. Its mission is over,
" Ramadan said at a press conference shortly after anti-aircraft
guns shot bright flashes into the Baghdad sky on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan repeated that UNSCOM is a tool of the American, adding
"It's only mission in Iraq now is to find a cover for the genitals
of those who want to carry out agression against Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Ramadhan said the U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq in
the past three nights caused civilian casualties 10 times higher
than military ones.
</P>
<P>
He accused the chief U.N. arms inspector Richard Butler of
providing pretext for U.S.-British aggression against Iraq by
submitting a false report in which he said Iraq did not fully
cooperate with U.N. arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
Butler, chairman of the U.N. Special Commission for disarming
Iraq (UNSCOM) was strongly criticized by some permanent member
states of the U.N. Security Council, said Ramadhan.
</P>
<P>
He elaborated that 80 percent of UNSCOM's activities were
carried out together with the International Atomic Energy Agency,
yet the latter submitted a factual report saying Iraq provided
cooperation at necessary level.
</P>
<P>
Ramadhan said the U.S.-British raids in the first night
were aimed at cutting off the contacts between the southern
part of the country and the central part by bombing TV and
radio stations.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. and Britain spread leaflets in southern
Iraq calling on the people there to rise up and topple
President Saddam Hussein.

TEHRAN, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami said Saturday that Iran is opposed to the U.S. bombardment

Iran believes that the problem should be resolved within the

Prikhodko said that Russia strongly condemns the U.S. and

WASHINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives Saturday voted 285-148 to pass the Third
impeachment article -- obstruction of justice -- against Bill
Clinton about his relationship with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky.

The third article alleges obstruction of justice by Clinton,
in connection with Lewinsky's grand Jury testimony, his
conversations with presidential secretary Betty Currie about her
testimony, and other issues.
</P>
<P>
The House vote for impeachment would send the case to the
Senate for a trial, where 67 votes, or two-thirds majority, would

<P>
LONDON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair on Saturday refused to comment on the impeachment against
U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"I say what I have always said about President Clinton, I don't
want to comment on the impeachment proceedings, it would be out of
place for me to do so," Blair said during a press conference in
Downing Street hours before the United States House of
Representatives in Washington voting on four articles of
impeachment against the American leader.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister then returned to discuss U.S. and British
military action in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Blair generally has stood foursquare with Clinton, most
recently in the conflict with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, while briefing the parliament on Britain's
decision to attack Iraq, Blair defended Clinton as "has shown the
courage to do the right thing" and said Clinton had his "full
support."
</P>

U.S. House of Representatives on Saturday approved to impeach
President Clinton on the grounds of perjury.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: Bombing Inflicts Significant Damage on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen said on Saturday that the U.S.-led air strikes had
inflicted "significant damage" on Iraq's military system.
</P>
<P>
At a Pentagon news conference, which came after the United
States launched the fourth wave of bombing against Iraq, Cohen
told reporters that U.S. analysts believe the assault had set
back Iraq's ballistic missile program by one year.
</P>
<P>
"We have diminished his ability to threaten his neighbors,"
he added. He acknowledged, however, that it is possible Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein eventually will be able to rebuild at
least some of the bombed facilities.
</P>
<P>
At the same news conference, Army Gen. Henry Shelton,
chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, expressed his satisfaction
over the result of the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
"I am very pleased by the result of our strikes," he said.
About 90 targets had been struck in Iraq so far, and some targets
had been hit more than once, he added.
</P>
<P>
When asked when the bombings will come to an end, Cohen said
it would continue until the president decides the mission has
been completed.
</P>
<P>
Shelton Echoed Cohen by saying: "It will stop when the
president orders it to stop."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Clinton said in his weekly radio address that he
believed "the mission is going well."

<HEADLINE> Millions in Syria Protest against Air-Strikes on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Syrian capital of
Damascus witnessed large demonstrations on Saturday with millions
of protestors shouting slogans denoucing the U.S.-British attacks
on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Among the slogans are "Aggression on Iraq is aggression on the
Arab nation," "No to unjust embargo on Iraq, Sudan and Libya,"
"Syria's people sides with brothers in Iraq," "U.S. aggression is
the rule of jungle not international legitimacy," "Down with
aggression on brotherly Iraq, Palestine, the Syrian Golan,
Lebanon, Sudan and Libya."
</P>
<P>
The angry protesters broke into the security barricades and
entered the U.S. embassy in Damascus. They destroyed the window
glass of the embassy and the nearby U.S. cultural centre and
pulled down the U.S. flag on the embassy.
</P>
<P>
They also broke into the British cultural center in Damascus
and stoned its windows and doors.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators gathered at Al-Shahrbandar park, downtown
Damascus, and one of the female students read a message addressed
to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan urging him in the name of the
demonstrators to stop the U.S.-British aggression on Iraq
immediately.
</P>
<P>
The message also called on Annan to halt the horrible
atrocities committed against the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
A group of students handed the text of the message to the
resident representative of the United Nations who expressed hope
of an early end to the sufferings of the Arab people with the
start of the holy month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
Aleppo, the second largest city in Syria, also saw similar
demonstrations by students and youth against the air strikes on
Iraq.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 19 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki has met Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba and said the rebels are an
important element of a cease-fire agreement, South African
television, SABC, reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, the television did not say when and where the meeting
was held.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said the cease-fire would be followed by a political
dialog among the Congolese people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rebels said they were ready to sign the
cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with SABC, Wamba dia Wamba said his
movement did not want to be an obstacle to peace.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to be made responsible for the breakdown of the
talks, or the breakdown of the process which would lead to
cease-fire. But otherwise we still think that fundamentally this
process of formal mechanisms may end up really entertaining
Congolese President Laurent Kabila and protecting him, not
necessarily advancing the process per se," Wamba dia Wamba said.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader led a delegation to an Organization of
African Unity (OAU) summit in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, this
week but once again was sidelined by African leaders, SABC said.
</P>
<P>
Delegates to the OAU meeting agreed to meet again in Lusaka,
Zambia on December 27 to finalize the cease-fire.

</P>
<P>
On September 9, Office of Independent Counsel submitted
Referral to Congress, accusing President Clinton of perjury and

</P>
<P>
On September 11, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to

</P>
<P>
On October 5, the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Groups Oppose U.S. Strikes Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Some Egyptian and Arab
professional groups Saturday denounced the U.S. and British
military strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Cinema Professions Syndicate
condemned the "flagrant aggression under a pretext that Iraq was
not cooperating with UNSCOM," Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The syndicate declared solidarity with the Iraqi people,
calling on the U.S. to realize that the aggression threatens its
own interests in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Pharmacists Syndicate said that it has decided to
boycott medicines made by U.S. and British firms in Egypt during
the holy month of Ramadan to protest their attacks on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The group appealed in a statement to other syndicates and the
Egyptians to take similar steps with regards to other U.S. and
British goods in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Teaching Professions Syndicate, in a statement
issued in the day, condemned the double standards which the
U.S. applies in dealing with Mideast affairs, saying that the
U.S. turns a deaf ear to Israel's possession of weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
The General Union of Arab Journalists denounced the
U.S.-British aggression against Iraq, saying it was aimed at
rendering the Iraqi people homeless and exposing them to hunger.
</P>
<P>
During the day, some members of Egypt's opposition parties held
a demonstration in front of the Cairo-based Arab League
headquarters in protest against the attack on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators called for the expulsion of U.S., British and
Kuwaiti ambassadors in Cairo and boycott of American and British
goods.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a group of journalists staged another demonstration
in Cairo, shouting anti-U.S. slogans and burning flags of the

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Impeaches Clinton for Perjury, Obstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives impeached President Bill Clinton on Saturday for
lying under oath and obstructing justice about his relationship
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, voting largely
along party lines to send his case to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
It was only the second presidential impeachment in U.S.
history.
</P>
<P>
The House approved two of the four articles of impeachment
lodged against Clinton, formally recommending that he be tried in
the Senate for committing perjury before a federal grand jury and
obstructing justice. Lawmakers rejected two other articles
accusing the president of perjury in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment lawsuit and abuse of his presidential powers.
</P>
<P>
The first vote was announced at 1:24 p.m. EST (GMT 6:24),
leaving the 42nd president to face the gravest moment of his
political career. Clinton was secluded with a minister at the
time, but planned a public appearance later in the day.
</P>
<P>
For Clinton to be removed from office, two-thirds of senators
would have to vote to convict him.
</P>
<P>
After being stunned by the abrupt resignation of its incoming
speaker, lawmaker Bob Livingston, the House proceeded with the
first impeachment votes since those against Andrew Johnson 130
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Five members of each party defected on the first article as the
House voted 228-206 to impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
The House then voted:
</P>
<P>
_229-205 to reject a second article, accusing Clinton of
committing perjury in the Jones suit. More than two dozen
Republicans defected to join Democrats.
</P>
<P>
_221-212 to approve a third article, accusing Clinton of
obstruction of justice in the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
_285-148 to reject a fourth article, alleging he abused the
powers of his office by giving false written answers to questions
posed by Congress during the impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Democrats briefly walked out of the chamber in protest when
Republicans blocked their effort to force a vote on the lesser
penalty of censure as an alternative to impeachment. They returned
to vote on the articles of impeachment, ending a three-month
constitutional drama that at the end played out amid U.S. military
action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The House immediately turned to votes on articles of
impeachment accusing Clinton of committing perjury in the Paula
Jones sexual harassment lawsuit, obstructing justice and abusing
his presidential powers.
</P>
<P>
Final arguments on the historic House votes paralleled those
laid out by Republicans and Democrats during a months-long debate
over the fitting punishment for a president who deceived the
nation, the Congress and his family.
</P>
<P>
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, a Republican
lawmaker, told legislators that Clinton's actions required
impeachment to ensure equal justice under the law.
</P>
<P>
Absent some sort of deal, a Senate trial of uncertain duration
will follow next year with Chief Justice William Rehnquist
presiding. It would be the first such proceeding since Andrew
Johnson escaped being removed from office by a single vote during
a Senate trial 130 years ago.
</P>
<P>
A quarter century ago, Richard Nixon resigned before facing a
certain impeachment vote in the House.
</P>
<P>
The somber House debate was brought to an instant hush when
incoming House Speaker Livingston called on Clinton to resign and
then told lawmakers he himself was resigning from Congress next
year because of revelations this week that he had extramarital
affairs.
</P>
<P>
"I must set the example that I hope President Clinton will
follow," Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
Democrats, buoyed by a last-minute visit to Capitol Hill by
Hillary Rodham Clinton, made one last move to force a vote on
censure as an alternative to impeachment. It was defeated 230-204.
</P>
<P>
Beforehand, they argued that neither Livingston nor Clinton
should succumb to the "politics of cynicism and smear."
</P>
<P>
House Minority Whip David Bonior charged that "angry partisans"
were seeking to undo the elections with a presidential impeachment
opposed by two-thirds of Americans.
</P>
<P>
In an early-morning visit to the Capitol, Mrs. Clinton rallied
Democrats and told them that the impeachment process against her
husband "should be done right and that up to now it has not been."

Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) Sunday
agreed to form a new coalition government with it under its
leadership, Radio Nepal said.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement, the NC said that its President and Prime
Minister of the present government Girija Prasad Koirala will head
the next government, the state-run radio said.
</P>
<P>
The party called on all political parties in the Lower House of
Parliament to be involved in forming the next government for free,
fair and impartial elections, which are due before November, 1999.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued earlier Sunday, the NC decided to
include all the parties in parliament into the cabinet under its
leadership.
</P>
<P>
With the support of the CPN-UML, which has 49 seats in the
Lower House, the NC with 88 seats now garners a majority in the
205-seat Lower House, making it impossible for the Communist Party
of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML) and its supporters to pass a
no-confidence motion registered Sunday against the NC government.
</P>
<P>
King Birendra had decided to call a special session of
parliament on December 24 to discuss the no-confidence motion.
</P>
<P>
A majority of 103 votes is needed in the Lower House to pass
the motion.
</P>
<P>
The new round of political turmoil erupted after the CPN-ML
quit the government on December 10 after sharing power with the NC
for three and a half months.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-ML alleged that its ruling partner had failed to
implement the agreements reached with it and other left parties in
August.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has witnessed five governments since the mid-term
elections in November 1994 which produced a hung parliament where
no single party holds a majority.

<P>
BONN, December 20 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer on Suanday appealed to the international community to
strive for a lifting of the sanctions against Iraq and
reintegrating that country into the international community.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Fischer welcomed the halt of the U.S.-British
air attacks on Iraq and said that the living conditions of the
Iraqi people must be improved.
</P>
<P>
But he added that a precondition for the lifting of the
sanctions is that Iraq no longer possesses weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said the air strikes became inevitable after Iraq
continued to refuse to cooperate with the U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the relations of the West with Russia and
the Arab world must not suffer as a result of the Iraq crisis.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Regrets over Stray Missile Strike on Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Sunday
expressed regret over a stray missile strike on Iran's
southwestern port city of Khorramshahr during the first stage of
its attacks on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Administration conveyed its regret to Iran through the
Swiss embassy in Tehran, which represents the U.S. interests in
Iran, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Washington said it has no intention to violate the territorial
integrity of the Islamic Republic of Iran and will probe into the
errant fall of its missile in Khorramshahr, Khuzestan province
which borders Iraq.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the joint U.S. and British strike against Iraq
on Thursday morning, a stray missile hit downtown Khorramshahr,
causing no injury but some damages.
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon spokesman on Friday denied all knowledge of a
stray missile strike on Iran and said that Pentagon knew
"nothing" about the incident.
</P>
<P>
A British Defense Ministry spokesman also rejected
responsibility for a stray missile attack, but said that Iran
should "really speak to the Americans" about the errant cruise
missile strike on Khorramshahr.
</P>
<P>
Iran has lodged a strong protest to both London and
Washington on Thursday by summoning the British charge d'affaires
in Tehran Nic Browne and the Swiss ambassador, representing the
U.S. interests in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran considered the stray missile attack as a "violation of
the Iranian territorial integrity" and warned the U.S. and Britain
not to repeat such a mistake.

<HEADLINE> Extremism, Terrorism Main Threats to Russia: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia is threated by the
growing extremist and chauvinist manifestations, terrorism and the
Western special services' intensified activities, a senior Russian
security officer said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a televised speech, Valdimir Putin, director of the Russian
Federal Security Service, said that the four factors are the main
present-day internal and external threats to Russia's security.
</P>
<P>
Putin said that against the backdrop of the current economic
crisis, "the problem of preserving Russia's territorial integrity
has become particularly acute" and "crime and corruption have
reached a dangerous level".
</P>
<P>
He said that daring and regular terrorist acts are posing an
increasing threat to the state and the general public, adding that
one of the main aspects of the Federal Security Services' work is
to take prompt steps to combat terrorism.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said, the Western special services have
been trying to obtain information about Russia's defense and
scientific and technological potential.
</P>
<P>
Foreign intelligence services are also trying to get
information about the combat readiness of the Russian armed
forces, primarily its nuclear deterrence component, he added.
</P>
<P>
Putin noted that the goal for the Federal Security Service is
to prevent foreign services' subversive acts, to ensure Russia's
economic security, to cut and eliminate channels of illegal drug
and arms trade, and to combat terrorism, organized crimes and
corruption.

<HEADLINE> Iran Blasts U.S.-British Strikes on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Iranian parliament's vice
speaker Hassan Rouhani on Sunday blasted the United States and
Britain for launching "illegal, inhumane and aggressive" strikes
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session of the Majlis (parliament),
Rouhani said it is under the pressure of world public opinions
that the the U.S. and Britain stopped their illegal strikes on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Rouhani dismissed the claims by the U.S. and Britain that their
attacks were aimed at eliminating Iraq's ability to make weapons
of mass destruction and forcing Baghdad to abide by relevant
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He called on Iraq to respect U.N. resolutions and not provide
the U.S. with pretexts for aggression and military build-up in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 151 parliament members on Sunday strongly condemned
the four-day air attacks on Iraq as "brutal", saying the joint
aggression was aimed at justifying their illegal military presence
in the Gulf and covering up U.S. President Bill Clinton's moral
scandal.
</P>
<P>
The attacks have once again caused tension in the region,
massacred a number of innocent people and damaged economic
resources in the Muslim world, a letter read at the end of the
session said.
</P>
<P>
The parliament members also condemned the stray missile attack on Iran's
southwestern port city of Khorramshahr, Khuzestan province on
Thursday, saying the move proved that the U.S. hostility against
Iran has not decreased.
</P>
<P>
They urged the Iranian Foreign Ministry to follow up the issue
through the U.N. until the damages are compensated and the
U.S. administration offers an apology.
</P>
<P>
The responsibility of preserving security in the region should
be undertaken by the countries themselves so as to restore calm
and tranquility to the region, they stressed.

<HEADLINE> Well Built Dykes Vital to Preventing Floods, Says Vice Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINGZHOU (HUBEI PROVINCE), December 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese
vice-premier Wen Jiabao stressed here today that well built river
dykes are vital to preventing floods, to the safety of people's
lives and property and to the on-going reform, economic growth and
stability of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader made the remark at a on-the-spot meeting on
the river dyke construction which ended here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
As work continues on rebuilding dykes along the Yangtze and
other major Chinese rivers following this summer's catastrophic
flooding, the Chinese vice-premier made an inspection trip along
sections of the Yangtze River to check on construction progress.
</P>
<P>
"The dykes must be of the highest quality. Every procedure
during the dyke building process must be carefully checked and
re-checked," insisted Wen, who is also a member of the Political
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
"Effective dykes are an essential part of any flood-control
projects and they have played an extremely important role in
helping combat this summer's flooding," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, one of the problems of existing dykes which became
apparent this summer, according to the vice-premier, was the
relative poor quality of many, which sprung leeks and holes and
were simply not solid enough to withstand turbulent waters.
</P>
<P>
"There is still the potential for damaging floods to occur
again along such major rivers like the Yangtze River, the Yellow
River, Haihe River and Huaihe River in the next flood season," the
Vice Premier warned.
</P>
<P>
He urged all relevant officials and local government
departments to give this matter their full attention and to make
careful preparations to prevent similar events.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the responsibility system must be earnestly
carried out and there must be strict supervision of the project
construction.
</P>
<P>
Active efforts should be made to spread the use of new
technologies and new materials, he added.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier said he was confident that within two to three
years, thanks to the ongoing construction of new dykes and dams
along China's major rivers, such serious flooding, which has been
an annual event, would no longer be such a problem and could even
be manageable.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Sanctuary Crucial for Migrant Birds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Two Chinese ornithologists
have revealed that Chongming Island off Shanghai is of great
importance for the survival of migrating birds between Northeast
Asia and Australia and that a development plan to establish it as
a nature reserve is needed.
</P>
<P>
The specialists, Qian Fawen and Zhang Xu, who have spent ten
years ringing thousands of migrating birds, told delegates at the
6th Northeast Asia and North Pacific Environmental Forum Workshop
here, which ended today, about the bird sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that the water-logged Chongming Island,
China's third largest, has become a major stop-off point for
birds migrating from Australia.
</P>
<P>
Now, they estimate that every year more than one million birds,
from approximately 103 species, arrive on the island, residing
mostly on its eastern side in a water-logged area of some 220 sq
km, about one fifth of the island's land mass.
</P>
<P>
The two specialists have urged the regional government to
introduce a special development plan to ensure the continued
existence of this habitat for birds. Failure to do so, they
insist, would have an unimaginable negative impact on the
environment.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Cabinet Approves More Demands on PNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Cabinet on Sunday
approved a list of conditions that the Palestinians must fulfill
before the implementation of the peace agreement signed two months
ago could continue.
</P>
<P>
These conditions demand the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) halt the violence and incitement against Israel, reduce the
police forces and collect all illegal weapons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PNA must give up its demand for the release of
Palestinian political prisoners in Israeli jails and abandon all
unilateral statements on declaring statehood on May 4, 1999,
according to the conditions.
</P>
<P>
The list of conditions was presented by Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, who has insisted that no more territory in the
West Bank would be handed over to the PNA until these demands are
met.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the PNA signed a land-for-security agreement on
October 23, under which Israel would withdraw its troops from 13
percent of the West Bank in exchange for tougher Palestinians
measures against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Israel suspended the withdrawal early this month, citing the
PNA breaches. However, local media said the real reason was the
pressure from the right-wingers in the Israeli government to halt
the process.
</P>
<P>
These conditions approved by the cabinet will be submitted to
the Knesset (parliament) on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has said that he will initiate early elections if he
is not able to muster enough backing in the Knesset on these
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a bill calling for dissolution of the Knesset and
early elections will be voted in the Knesset on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Haaretz on Sunday quoted Knesset members as saying
that early elections are inevitable.
</P>
<P>
And the main question now is whether Netanyahu will announce
his support for the current bill or will initiate a bill of his
own to the same end.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Confident on Macao's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Chen Ziying, deputy director
of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office under the State Council,
today expressed his confidence that the return of Macao to China
will be smooth and will follow the principle of "one country, two
systems".
</P>
<P>
On the one-year countdown of Macao's return, he told Xinhua
that China's resumption of exercise of sovereignty over Macao on
December 20, 1999 will mark the end of all foreign occupation
of Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who is also secretary general of the Preparatory
Committee for the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR), said
that the committee has started its critical work for Macao's
return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Outlining his plans, he explained that the Preparatory Committee
will concentrate its efforts on forming a broadly representative
Selection Committee for the First Government of the Macao SAR, in
accordance with the decision of the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
"The Preparatory Committee has already drawn up a specific
blueprint for the Selection Committee using the guidelines and
principles of justice, openness, democracy and honesty," Chen
said, adding that he expected it to be set up by early next year.
</P>
<P>
In terms of how China and Portugal will cooperate on the
handover, Chen stressed that this should be done responsibly and
that common sense should be used on such matters as the transfer
of government assets and records, the localization of civil
servants, nd on the details of the handover ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that in the transitional period the Portuguese
Macao government is responsible for making arrangements for
housing the Chinese garrison.
</P>
<P>
"This is because Macao will still be under Portuguese
administration until midnight on December 19, 1999, and the Basic
Law of the Macao SAR stipulates that China's central government
will be responsible for SAR's defense," Chen added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the people of Macao will play an important
role in the transition, and that the successful election of the
Selection Committee's members and chief executive, as well as the
celebrations for Macao's return to China, will depend on them.
</P>
<P>
"The people's participation in the transition is part of the
process of implementing the principle that 'the Macao people will
govern Macao with a high degree of autonomy'," he emphasized.

<HEADLINE> US Attack Against Iraq Is Dangerous Move: Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The attack against Iraq by the
United States has set a dangerous precedent for the use of force
to violate the sovereignty of an independent country which is a
member of the United Nations, said Vietnamese party's daily Nhan
Dan (the people daily) Friday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said in a commentary that the attack by the
United States and Britain on Iraq on December 16 was a dangerous
move, violating Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity and
running counter to the UN Charter.
</P>
<P>
It points out that the attack has aggravated tensions in the
gulf area.
</P>
<P>
The attack also shows that when necessary, the United States is
prepared to ignore the role of the UN security council as well as
the efforts made by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan to find a
peaceful solution to the conflict, the newspaper notes.
</P>
<P>
"For whatever reason, a military attack launched with modern
war means by the United States against Iraq is unacceptable," the
commentary of Nhan Dan stresses, saying that the move has trampled
upon international law and the sacred rights of nations and caused
grave consequences.

Majali on Sunday called for Arab countries and the world community
to help put an end the sufferings of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
During a parliamentary debate on the U.S.-British attacks on
Baghdad, the speaker denounced the military action as
"aggression," and reiterated his supports for the "steadfast"
Iraqi people during the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
Majali also called on his parliament, people and government
to join efforts and work for improving Iraqi people's miserable
situation.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government has expressed regret at the U.S -led
air raids on Baghdad, triggered by what the U.S government called
Iraq's failure to cooperate fully with U.N arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian King Hussein called U.S. President Bill Clinton,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and French President Jacques
Chirac after the attack began, calling for a diplomatic solution
to the current Iraqi crises.

<P>
BAGHDAD, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Sunday refuted claims
made by British Prime Minister Tony Blair that Britain and the
U.S. tried to observe feelings of Muslims throughout the four days
of air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency quoted an Information Ministry spokesman
as saying that "Blair and his master (U.S. President Bill) Clinton
had despised feelings of Muslims by not respecting traditions of
the holy month of Ramadan."
</P>
<P>
Ramadan, during which Muslims exercise fasting from sunrise to
sundown, began in Iraq on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"How could one dare to say that he respected the month of
Ramadan while firing hundreds of missiles and bombs and carrying
out air raids on the people of Iraq and destroying their plants,
schools, hospitals and economic institutions," the spokesman asked.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched a fourth round of raids against
Baghdad at around 6:45 p.m. local time Saturday (1545 GMT) when
Muslims were praying.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Blair's claims that the air strike were not
an attack on Iraq's sovereignty proved that "this is the logic of
colonialists who seek to give themselves the right to attack
others to serve their narrow-minded interests."
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqi people will remain loyal to their patriotic regime
under the leadership of President Saddam Hussein," said the
spokesman.

<HEADLINE> China, U.S. to Cooperate in Diabetes Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Health has
teamed up with a major U.S. medical equipment company to establish
a special fund to help train doctors to tackle the rising diabetes
problem in the country and to launch a public awareness campaign
in this regard.
</P>
<P>
MiniMed Inc. of the United States, which was founded by people
with diabetes, will be one of the main financial backers. The
company manufacturers pager size insulin pumps which are
considered to be the most advanced method for intensive treatment
of the blood disease.
</P>
<P>
Experts from China and the United States have been in
discussions about current and future research into diabetes, its
increase in China and how international cooperation can be
mobilized for improving treatment.
</P>
<P>
Professor Qian Rongli from the No. 1 Hospital attached to the
Beijing Medical Sciences University, said: "We can surely reduce
and prevent diabetes, although we do know that western and
traditional Chinese medicines are not able to completely cure the
disease."
</P>
<P>
"Accurate monitoring of blood sugar levels are an important
indicator in helping control complications caused by diabetes," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Experiments carried out during the past two decades in
developed countries show that by effectively controlling blood
sugar levels as many as half of those with diabetes can avoid
complications or at the very least delay their onset.
</P>
<P>
The results also demonstrated that such controls can help
reduce the chances of the incidents of related cardiovascular and
cerebral in elderly patients by as much as 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
Over 50 million Chinese diabetics are spending more than 170
billion yuan (about 20 billion U.S. dollars) every year on medical
care, according to a recent national epidemiological survey.
</P>
<P>
In the United States last year it cost medical care
organizations and insurance companies 100 billion dollars to treat
diabetes and 60 percent of that figure was used for kidney
failure, blindness, necrosis of lower limbs and neurological
problems caused by the disease.
</P>
<P>
MiniMed vice president Linda Fredrickson, who has suffered with
diabetes for 37 years, invented a 24-hour monitoring device to
control blood sugar levels, which are used in conjunction with the
tiny insulin pumps.
</P>
<P>
The pump delivers a sustained supply of insulin by imitating
normal body secretions of the chemical. Linda Fredrickson revealed
that since she began using the insulin pump 18 years ago she has
not suffered any complications from her diabetes.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhao, an official with the Ministry of Health, said that
if people continue to pay little attention to the diabetes, it
could have damaging effects on their lives and working habits.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to launch an effective preventive health education
publicity program in Chinese communities to advise on the
treatment for diabetes." he added.

<HEADLINE> Thai Women Hit Hard By Economic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Thai women workers, hit hard
by the economic recession, faced family problems because of job
losses, a survey revealed.
</P>
<P>
The mass lay-offs in 1998 mostly took place in the textiles
and electronics industries where 90 percent of workers are women,
according to the survey, made public on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the laid-off workers are aged 40-50 or nearing
retirement. These workers had been working for long periods and
received high payment and welfare, said the survey, conducted by
the Friends of Women Foundation.
</P>
<P>
In many lay-off cases, it was found that employers only used
the reason of business losses or cutting operation costs as a
claim for laying off workers.
</P>
<P>
Female workers had suffered a lot after they were laid off
because most of them are low-skilled laborers who have spent most
the their lives in the industrial sector. Their income was not
enough for savings and they had no idea of what to do and where to
turn. Many found it hard to find new jobs because their
qualifications do not match requirements in current job markets.
</P>
<P>
The most important problem was that these women were the main
supporters of their families and they had children to take care
of.
</P>
<P>
Many female workers have been turned away by their husbands
who felt a heavier burden in taking care of their unemployed
wives. Some were beaten by their husbands, who sometimes looked
for new wives with more secure jobs.
</P>
<P>
Such conflicts between parents also caused problems to
children. Children suffered from stress and many became drug
addicts. Some even tried to commit suicide.

<HEADLINE> U.S., British Embassies in Lusaka Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S and British Embassies
here have been closed as a precaution against possible terrorist
attacks in the wake of their air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Two Zambian policemen guarding the U.S. embassy told Xinhua
here Sunday morning that the embassy has been closed since last
Thursday, soon after the U.S. and Britain launched the air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
A security guard in the British High Commission also confirmed
here Sunday that the commission has been closed since last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
But both said the embassy and the commission may be reopened
Monday.
</P>
<P>
After Xinhua checked a local newspaper report of the closure
of the two missions, a Zambian sergeant drove to where the U.S.
embassy is situated along with some other policemen and brought
the Xinhua correspondent to a Zambian police office nearby.
</P>
<P>
A police officer asked the reporter to show his press card and
raised such questions as what he does and how long he has been
staying in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the correspondent was let go after the police officer
checked the Sunday Mail which reported the closure.
</P>
<P>
But when the correspondent passed by the U.S. embassy again on
his way home, a U.S. embassy staff member also asked him similar
questions like those put to him by the Zambian police officer.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official explained that the measure was taken as the
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania had been bombed on August 7
this year, killing over 260 people.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Baghdad Residents Relieved at Completion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Baghdad residents said on
Sunday morning that, after four sleepless nights, they felt
relieved at the completion of the U.S.-British air strikes against
the Iraqi capital.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy, and we can sleep comfortably tonight," said a
group of school boys playing soccer near the Ramadan 14th Street.
</P>
<P>
"I feel relieved at the news," said Muthana Salman, a government
staff in a taxation office.
</P>
<P>
He said he thought the strikes had no use but harming the Iraqi
people. "We are not surprised at this aggression. As Muslims, we
expect Zionists (Israel) to strike us at any time," he said
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair announced on Saturday the end of the four-day U.S.-British
air strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The fourth round of U.S.-British raids against Baghdad came at
around 6:45 p.m. local time when Muslims were praying. Saturday
was the first day of the holy fasting month of Ramadan in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua correspondent met a housewife called Faeza Jaafar near
a mosque Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
"Allah prohibits fighting during the holy month of Ramadan. We,
as Muslims, respect this very much. But it seems that the U.S. and
Britain do not respect this and violate the laws of God," said
Jaafar angrily.
</P>
<P>
"I cried as I heard the bombardment mixed with the voice of the
clergy guiding the evening prayers in the mosques. This is painful
and not easy for Muslims to tolerate, because we are fasting," she
added.
</P>
<P>
"America is not supposed to strike Iraq during the holy month
of Ramadan, the aggression will not change anything," said Ali, a
shopkeeper.
</P>
<P>
"As Muslims, we denounce the bombardment during the holy month
of Ramadan. This is illegal and inhumane and provocative," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"I wonder why America did this, I think Clinton wants to avert
people's attention from his sex scandal and the Congress debate on
impeachment," said Salaah Mohammed, a graduate student in Baghdad
University.
</P>
<P>
"Clinton sacrificed lives of innocent people for his personal
interests, this is absolutely inhumane and insane," he added.
</P>
<P>
Relieved as they were over the suspension of the air strike,
the Iraqi people are concerned more with the lifting of the
eight-year-old U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is not in the strike, rather it is in the
continuation of embargo which is a genocide that reaps more souls
than the strike," said an officer who refused to be identified.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy at the news, but I dream of lifting the sanctions,"
said Mustafa Mahmood, a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed sweeping economic sanctions on Iraq
following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait which touched off the 1991
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
"I don't care about the end of strike, I care about the lifting
of sanctions. Then I will be really happy to see the Iraqi people
living normally, just like all the other nations," said Mohammed
Kamel, a government employee.
</P>
<P>
A mass funeral procession was held in Baghdad on Saturday for
68 civilians who were killed during the U.S.-British air raids in
the past three nights.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Banks Spend Much to Sort Unfit Notes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Nigeria
(CBN) and commercial banks have spent a large amount of money on
the sorting of the local currency Naira in order to ensure the
unfit notes are removed from circulation.
</P>
<P>
Yemi Akju, Managing Director of Interprods Limited which is a
notable currency sorting machine producer, said that the CBN
spends more than 35 million U.S. Dollars on note sorting project
annually, The Guardian newspaper Sunday quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Despite the huge expenditure on Naria management, he noted,
only about 20 percent of the Naira notes in circulation had been
sorted and the huge pile of currency notes lodged by banks into
the CBN since 1995 are yet to be sorted.
</P>
<P>
In view of this, according to Akju, the CBN had to direct
commercial banks in this west African country to sort their cash
into fit and unfit before lodging them into the CBN.
</P>
<P>
About 16.5 million Dollars have been paid as fine by
commercial banks in the country which violated the CBN directive
of sorting their Naira notes before lodging them into the CBN, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Ayo Awojide, a commercial banker, observed that asking
commercial banks to sort currency notes is not the solution to
the problem of mutilated notes in circulation.
</P>
<P>
The banker noted that banks had to spend an enormous amount of
money not only on the acquisition of the sorting machines but
also on provision of security and insurance cover for the large
volume of cash to be moved to sorting centers.
</P>
<P>
The current exchange rate is about 86 Naira to one Dollar and
the highest value of the local currency note in circulation is 50
Naira.
</P>
<P>
The low denomination of Naira costs the country a lot of money
to keep the currency in circulation and sorting.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has approved the new denominations of
100 Naira and 500 Naira in view of inconveniencies and security
implications of moving large sums of money in 50 Naira notes.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Congress Decides to Induct All Parties Into </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 20 (Xinhua) -- In a move to consolidate its
leadership in the government, the ruling Nepali Congress (NC)
Sunday decided to include all the political parties in parliament
into the cabinet under its leadership.
</P>
<P>
The party made the decision in order to end the present
political crisis and hold elections in a free, fair and impartial
manner, the party said in a press release issued after its Central
Working Committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
The decision came three days after King Birendra decided to
call a special session of parliament on December 24, where a
no-confidence motion is expected to be tabled against the NC
government.
</P>
<P>
The decision was welcomed by the minor Nepal Sadbhavana Party,
but others, including the main opposition Communist Party of Nepal
(United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) and NC's former ruling partner
Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML), have not made
comments.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-ML pulled out on December 10 after sharing power with
the NC for three and a half months. It alleged that the NC had
failed to implement the agreements reached with it and other left
parties in August.
</P>
<P>
On December 11, following a recommendation by Prime Minister
Girija Prasad Koirala for dissolution of parliament for elections
on March 31, 1999, 62 members of parliament from the CPN-ML and
its supporters made a submission to the Royal Palace for a special
parliament session to discuss a no-confidence motion they were
planning against the government.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML and other parties said that elections were the only
way out and they demanded the formation of a new coalition
government comprising all the major political parties for free,
fair and impartial elections.

<P>
RIYADH, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia "has not and will
never allow any foreign troops to attack a third country through
its territory," a news report said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A Saudi Arabian official was quoted by newspaper al-Riyadh as
saying that his country has definitely repudiated reports by an
Iranian press agency that the U.S. and British forces on Friday
entered Iraq through Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The official added he was regretful that a Qatar radio station
broadcast the reports from Iran, which would produce chaos.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British forces in the Gulf began a four-night air
strike against Iraq Thursday after Richard Butler, chairman
of the U.N. Special Commission on disarming Iraq, reported that
Iraq had not cooperated fully with weapons inspectors.

<HEADLINE> India Yet to Recognize Magnitude of AIDS: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 20 (Xinhua) -- India is yet to recognize
the magnitude of AIDS menace and lacks unified and integrated
infrastructure to tackle this problem, Press Trust of India (PTI)
quoted a senior Indo-American AIDS projects expert as saying here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"India still lacks an integrated comprehensive strategy to deal
with this epidemic and has ignored the predictions of
international bodies," said Professor S. K. Mishra, who is the
leader of the HIV/AIDS collaborative projects between India and
the University of South California, U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
"About 38 million people suffer from HIV/AIDS all over the
world at present out of which over four million are from India,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Maharashtra State, including Bumbai is the most severely
affected where the prevalence rate is two percent among the adult
population," he said.
</P>
<P>
The University of South California is planning to set up a
center for prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS in India. The
university would be working with the World Bank, USAID, WHO and
other agencies active in this field, he further said.
</P>
<P>
The center intended to develop a comprehensive, collaborative
and integrated model to fight AIDS at every level by ensuring the
participation of religious, social, educational and other
institutions in the country, he added.

<HEADLINE> Strikes on Iraq Spurs Business for Jordanian Travel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.-led strikes on Iraq
spurred business for Jordanian travel agents, car and taxi
drivers, who have doubled their charges for trips between Amman
and Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian taxi drivers are currently charging 400 to 500 U.S.
dollars for a full car load of people traveling between the two
capitals, against an average 150 dollars in normal time.
</P>
<P>
"One man's misfortune being another man`s fortune," said the
semi-official Jordan Times in a story covering the price hike on
the Amman-Baghdad routine.
</P>
<P>
Abul Fatah, a Jordanian car transport agent said much of the
businesses depend on Jordanian students and other nationals who
are based in Iraq but came to Jordan for holidays. They had to
return to Baghdad by Jordanian means of transportation.
</P>
<P>
Companies in Amman are paying truck drivers a tip between 30 to
50 Jordanian dinars (44 to 60 dollars) for each Amman-Baghdad
round trip against the basic salary of a driver of about 150
Jordanian dinars (210 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Most of the drivers are oil tank drivers who shuttle between
the Amman-Baghdad highway, shipping crude oil and oil products
from Iraq, the only source of petroleum of Jordan since the
1990-91 Gulf crises.
</P>
<P>
However, some Jordanian drivers are reluctant to make the
journey, though they admit the pay is handsome, out of fear for
their lives on the way.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 Jordanian drivers were killed or injured on the way
during the 1991 Gulf War.

<P>
JERUSALEM, December 20 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli injured in an
explosion in Jerusalem's Old City was detained Sunday, suspected
of attempting to attack Arabs, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
The man was brought to a Jerusalem hospital early Sunday
morning with wounds to his hands and was held by police, who
suspect him of attempting to bomb attack Arab Palestinians in the
Old City.
</P>
<P>
The radio speculated that the suspect was trying to plant a
bomb in the Old City's Arab quarter when it exploded at the
northwest gate of the Old City.
</P>
<P>
The police also suspect the man of being responsible for seven
stabbing attacks on Palestinians in Jerusalem in the past year.
</P>
<P>
The last stabbing incident occurred in the Old City on
November 2, in which a 41-year-old Palestinian, Mousa Al-Natsheh,
was stabbed to death, apparently by Jew.

<HEADLINE> Cleanest Asian Games Rings Down Curtain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The 13th Asian Games, hailed
by organizers as one of the cleanest ever, concluded here on
Sunday with South Korea trailing unbeatable China and Japan
languishing in third place.
</P>
<P>
China remains Asia's top sports power although it has declined
in swimming and track. Its collection of 129 golds was nearly
double South Korea's haul.
</P>
<P>
High-tech and greater awareness made the Bangkok Games one of
the cleanest sports events in the world. There were only two drug
cases involving a Jordanian and a Kuwaiti weightlifter, none of
whom was among the medal winners.
</P>
<P>
The 1994 Asian Games in Hiroshima was tarnished by widespread
drug use including 11 positive tests by Chinese. A dark chapter
in Asian sports was not repeated in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
South Korea snatched the second place from Japan, which
finished after China and South Korea in the Hiroshima Games but
was later raised to second after seven Chinese swimmers tested
positive and their medals were stripped of and redistributed.
</P>
<P>
Despite winning 52 golds against South Korea's 65, Japan
emerged the best performer in this games.
</P>
<P>
Japaese Naoko Takahashi opened the competition with probably
the top performance of the games, winning in Thailand's tropical
heat in the fifth fastest women's marathon ever.
</P>
<P>
Koji Ito, Japan's golden boy, posted the Asian record of 10.00
seconds in the 100m dash. His incridable time over 100m and three
golds earned him the honor as the games' most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
Chinese table tennis player Wang Nan turned out the most
crowned athlete in the games. She won four golds from women's
team, doubles, singles and mixed double and is set to take over
invincible Deng Yaping as the world top player.
</P>
<P>
West triumphed over east in soccer field as Iran and Kuwait
finished 1-2 and 2002 World Cup co-hosts South Korea and Japan
suffered early exits.
</P>
<P>
A golden goal against South Korea made Thailand forget about
all its economic difficulties for two days until the host team was
blanked 3-0 in the semifinals by Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The list of title-winning delegations was expanded as 23
countries and regions stuck gold in this games against 20 in
Hiroshima and 15 in the 1990 Games in Beijing.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Italian Industry Minister
Pierluigi Bersani is expected to arrive in Turkey Monday for talks
on removing obstacles between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish-Italian political and economic ties soured after
Italy rejected a Turkish warrant for the extradition of Turkish
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Italian law bars the extradition to a country where the
suspect can face the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Turkey started to impose embargo on Italian goods after Italy
refused to hand over to Turkey Ocalan, leader of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) that has been fighting a 14-year-old
separatist war in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Anatolia News Agency reported Sunday that Bersani will
hold talks with Turkish Industry and Trade Minister Yalim Erez and
Energy Minister Cumhur Ersumer.
</P>
<P>
Italy is Turkey's second largest trade partner in Europe. And
Turkey is eager to join the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was detained November 12 by Italian police upon his
arrival in Rome by a flight from Moscow. He was jailed for a week
and then put under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
An Italian court has decided to lift all restrictions on Ocalan
after Germany dropped its own request for his extradition. Ocalan
has applied for political asylum in Italy.

<P>
CAIRO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Egyptian newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Al Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt's ambassador in Mogadishu Mahmoud Mustafa said Egypt
has distinguished role in backing peace in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Egypt pursues efforts to achieve national reconciliation in
Somalia in a bid to maintain Somali unity and re-build the state's
institutions devastated over the civil war, he added.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- The Economic Committee at People's Assembly in its meeting
Saturday, approved Egypt-Morocco free trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is designed to promoting the two countries' trade
exchange.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Minister of Information Safwat Al Sherif said Saturday that
Egypt will be the first Arab and African country to began radio
transmission via satellite.
</P>
<P>
He said that the first stage of radio satellite transmission
will begin in March 1999. The new service will cover the whole
world clearly.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Gazette
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Saturday that the
U.S.-led military actions against Iraq "raised many question
marks."
</P>
<P>
Regretting Washington's decision to use force to end the
Iraq-U.N. standoff, Moussa blamed both the Iraqi government and
the United Nations Special Commission and its chief Richard Butler
for the escalation of the situation.
</P>
<P>
He also criticised Washington and London for acting
unilaterally without the authorization of the U.N. Security
Council.

<HEADLINE> Japan Fails to Reach Target in Bangkok Asiad, Sports Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Despite toppling China from
the swimming pool, Japan still felt unsatisfied with the second
spot in the overall gold tally at the Asian Games which had its
last event concluded here Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
As South Korea took the men's marathon, Japan was kept at bay
with 52 golds against South Korea's 65, not to mention the distant
front-runner China who has 129 golds to its credit, which was far
below its 64 golds collected in Hiroshima.
</P>
<P>
Teruji Kogake, Chef de Mission of the Japanese delegation, was
reluctant in cheering for the Japanese success in athletics and
swimming, saying the results were mainly due to China sending
younger and less experienced athletes, not Japanese improvement.
</P>
<P>
Japan outbeat China 15-13 in the swimming pool as Chinese woman
swimmer Chen Yan skipped three events due to diarrhea, and more
than doubled its athletics gold tally from five to 12, with a sole
Asian record set up by its man sprinter Koji Ito who clocked 10.00
seconds in the 100m semifinal.
</P>
<P>
However, the Japanese top official was still full of sorrow as
its team sports had the worst performances in the Bangkok meet.
</P>
<P>
"We were shocked that our soccer team did so poorly, and our
baseball team suffered a called game in the finals," he said at a
news conference prior to the end of the Games, "There are cases
where we expected victories, but ended up with painful losses."
</P>
<P>
As the Games to be rolled down its curtain this evening, Japan
had gold medals from 11 sports as opposed to 20 in the Hiroshima
Games four years ago, Kogake said.
</P>
<P>
In an overall review, Japan lost to South Korea in 14 of 15
encounters in team events, losing one of its most prized medals in
baseball to South Korea 13-1 in the final.
</P>
<P>
The first shock was the team's early exit from the football
tournament when the United Arab Emirates dampened Olympian dreams
of Japan's under-21 football squad in the early stage.
</P>
<P>
Its volleyball players, who once dominated the world, ended
their worst Asian Games tournament with the men finishing fourth
and the women third.
</P>
<P>
The only bright spot was the women's basketball team, winning
gold against China, Kogake said.
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of work to do in the next one year and nine
months before the Olympics," Kogake said.
</P>
<P>
With its biggest-ever squad of 630 athletes, Japan had aimed to
do better than in Hiroshima to narrow a wide gap behind China, who
dethroned them in the Asian Games gold-medal standings in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the gap was widened instead and would have been ever worse
but for a series of brilliant performances from its swimmers and
track stars.
</P>
<P>
"It is very disappointing to miss our main target," said
Kogake, "If we don't take an appropriate action, we won't even get
50 at the next Games in Pusan."
</P>
<P>
"We must use the setbacks in the games as an impetus to put
together the strongest possible team for the Sydney Olympics,"
said Kogake.

<HEADLINE> Youths' Party Formed in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- A new political party to cater
for the interests of youths has been formed in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The party known as the Young Democrats Revolutionary Movement
(YDRM) was formed in Lusaka last week and will be officially
launched in February next year, government-owned Zambia Daily
Mail reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted YDRM's interim president Obed Ivase as saying
in an interview at the weekend that the newly-founded party which
will limit its membership to those 35 years old or below is being
financially and materially supported by political organizations
in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The party, as Ivase said, is designed to give Zambian youths a
say in national issues rather than limiting their roles to slogan
chanting and stone throwing on behalf of elder politicians.
</P>
<P>
"Youths make up about 75 percent of our country's entire
population, but these youths are just exploited by political
parties and none of them have been given an opportunity to
participate in running party affairs or the country," Ivase
argued.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that his party is targeting its full political
involvement on the 2001 presidential and parliamentary elections
and that the party will start campaigning as soon as it is
registered.
</P>
<P>
Ivase elaborated on YDRM's target by saying the party will
take part in the 2001 elections but will only contest for
parliamentary seats and it is not interested in contesting the
republican presidency now.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that some experienced politicians older than
35 years could be incorporated into the party to assist its
operations although these "old" politicians will not be allowed
to be in the majority.
</P>
<P>
The formation of YDRM, according to the paper, was motivated
by the Swedish Young Conservative Party and the Young Socialist
Party which has a youth member in the Swedish parliament.

<HEADLINE> China Still Dominant in Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 20 (Xinhua) -- After taking 129 gold medals
to top the medal table at the 13th Asian Games, China proved they
are still the dominant force in Asian sports.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation, which clean swept gold medals in the
sports of Wushu, rowing, diving and the women's weightlifting,
collected 129 gold, 78 silver and 67 bronze medals for a total of
274 in the 15-day Asiad.
</P>
<P>
With South Korea and Japan finished a distant second and third
with 65 and 52 gold medals respectively, China's domination in th
Asiad is even more eminent.
</P>
<P>
But as Chinese sports officials were satisfied with the number
of gold medals their athletes won, they had the reason to be
dissatisfied with the performances their athletes put up in the
Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
At the Bangkok Asiad, Chinese athletes failed to deliver the
usual spree of stunning world records and gold medals.
</P>
<P>
The only eye-catching performance of Chinese athletes came in
the women's weightlifting in which China is a powerhouse even at
the Olympic level.
</P>
<P>
Chinese women's lifters broke 13 world records and won all the
7 gold medals.
</P>
<P>
But they found their domination being challenged by those from
Myanmar, Thailand and DPR Korea for the first time in Asiad
history. And the Chinese head coach admitted that in the
following two or three years, Chinese women lifters will have to
face a even more serious challenge.
</P>
<P>
Chinese world-class gymnasts also felt a bit uneasy as two of
the 14 gold medals slipped off their hands as they only managed a
mediocre performance.
</P>
<P>
Chinese women's cagers were even humiliated by their Japanese
counterparts in the final, losing with a big margin of 24 points.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese athletics team, which said could win at least 18-20
golds before the tournament, missed their target and barely edged
their Japanese opponents 15-12 in medal table.
</P>
<P>
But in the swimming pool, China suffered a bitter defeat to the
Japanese, winning only 13 golds to Japan's 15.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time since the 1990 Asian Games that China was
beaten in the pool by their Japanese rivals.
</P>
<P>
Even the all-conquering Chinese diving team could fully enjoy
their victories in the competitions though they as usual took all
the four gold medals with great ease.
</P>
<P>
As deputy team manager Zhou Jihong put it, the performances of
Chinese divers at the Asiad were not so satisfactory, "if we
compete at this level in major international meets, we will be no
match to ace divers like Demitry Sautin." Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
But taking the fact China fielded mostly the young hopefuls at
the Asian Games into consideration, China have basically achieved
all their aims.
</P>
<P>
Tu Mingde, Secretary General of the Chinese Olympic Committee,
said:"Our athletes have learnt a lot about winning fairly and
sportsmanship. We've basically achieved all our aims."

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The NBA all-star
exhibition game attracted no big attention from fans and only
drew half of a packed-crowd in Atlantic City tonight.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition was more about showmanship than defense and
teamwork, about half of the 12,500-seat Convention Center was
occupied by the crowd, made up mostly of teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
Neither owners nor players got much sentiment from
action-starved fans who attended "The Game on Showtime".
</P>
<P>
Shawn Kemp has gained at least 15 pounds during the 5
1/2-month lockout. Both he and Mitch Richmond sweated all over on
the court.
</P>
<P>
Karl Malone also looked rusty on the court, fumbling the ball
on his way to a fast-break slam and losing it out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
The players, 16 current and former All-Stars, received an
ovation when they took the court. Showtime and the public address
announcer were prohibited from using their team's nicknames or
the letters NBA.
</P>
<P>
"They don't look fresh," said Robb Lasane, 16. "The ball is
good, they're just out of shape a bit."

<HEADLINE> More Election-Related Incidents Reported in S.Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Twenty election-related
incidents have been recorded since nominations began on December
8, police said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The incidents include attempted murder, arson, assault, damage
to property, intimidation and mischief and the latest one was the
burning of a People's Alliance (PA) party office at Mundel in
Puttalam district.
</P>
<P>
Police said clashes had been reported between supporters of the
United National Party (UNP) and the PA. The other five parties and
four independent groups running for the North Western Provincial
Council have had no problems.
</P>
<P>
PAFFREL, the Poeple's Action for Free and Fair Elections, has a
made joint appeal to all parties and groups to cooperate in a free
and fair election due on January 25, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The polls monitoring group's Executive Director Kingsley
Rodrigo said the PA's chief minister candidate leader S.B. Nawinna
and his UNP counterpart Jayawickrama Perera had signed a
no-violence agreement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement renews hopes that the provincial poll which
assumes national significance would be relatively peaceful,
analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
Party leaders are planning to join the campaign after Christmas
and throw everything into the poll which is seen as a test of
strength for both the PA and the UNP, the two major parties in the
country.
</P>
<P>
UNP sources said party leader Ranil Wickremesinghe would
personally lead the campaign in Kurunegala district while party
secretary Gamini Atukorale would concentrate on Puttalam district.
</P>
<P>
President Chandrika Kumaratunga will personally join the PA
campaign while each constituency in the province is being handled
by a cabinet minister.

<P>
NEW DELHI, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Pivotals crashed on the
Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) market during the week on selling
pressure following the U.S.-led air strikes against Iraq coupled
with lack of speculative support.
</P>
<P>
The BSE sensitive index dropped from the week's best level of
3,029.15 to 2,850.48 before finishing at 2,875.09 with a sizable
loss of 127.42 points from the previous weekend's close of
3,002.51.
</P>
<P>
The national index also lost by 59.82 points to 1,267.86 from
the previous weekend's close of 1,327.68.
</P>
<P>
The volume of business remained moderate and the weekend
sentiment was weak. The sellers dominated the market with
pharmaceutical and consumer goods shares showing heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
Business remained thin by the absence of foreign funds who were
holding their stocks waiting for an opportunity to sell at higher
levels before the year end.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Press Condemns Attack Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. and British
bombings of Iraq for the past four consecutive days have evoked
strong criticism from the Mexican press.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican daily El Sol de Mexico said on Saturday that it is
the United Nations Security Council which should have taken the
resolution to sanction Iraq, and not one of its member countries,
however mighty it can be.
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper "El Heraldo" said that the most concerning
aspect of the case is that it has already been said that every
time William Clinton is in trouble, he starts some kind of armed
persecution against some "enemy."
</P>
<P>
It added that to divert the public attention from the trial
started against him seems to be his favorite strategy, and every
time he feels cornered he seeks to deviate attention in this
insensitive and cruel manner.
</P>
<P>
The Novedades published a bylined article saying that all the
acts of almost one year, including the launching of the armed
attacks against Iraq are the result of Clinton's efforts to hide
his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
La Jornada said the political crisis brought about by the
so-called sexgate and its possible links with the bombing of Iraq
shows the hypocrisy, the decadence, the opportunism, the abuse of
power, and the oligarchic character of the U.S. political system.
</P>
<P>
The Excelsior recalled that President Clinton ordered the armed
attack against Iraq just on the occasion of the 50th anniversary
of the Human Rights Universal Declaration.
</P>
<P>
"This genocidal action is killing a big number of civilians who
do not have anything to do with the personal confrontation between
Hussein and the United States," it said.
</P>
<P>
"What is most surprising is that supposedly the war of the Big
Gendarme against Saddam is to prevent him from accumulating
arsenals of chemical weapons, but the United States does use
them. They are very popular in the catalogs of the orders
Washington fulfills for his allies in all the world," said the
Excelsior.

<HEADLINE> Shipbuilders Struggle to Remain Afloat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Hit hard by currency
devaluations in Japan and South Korea and a slack international
shipping market, China's shipbuilding industry has lost a
significant number of orders, and is struggling to enhance
competitiveness to escape the doldrums.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily (Business Weekly) reported that China's
shipbuilders lost orders totalling about 1.8 million dead weight
tons to foreign competitors in the first nine months this year.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign ship owners are reluctant to take deliveries from
Chinese shipyards due to a sluggish global shipping market and
fluctuations in their own currencies.
</P>
<P>
To bolster vessel exports, the government twice this year
raised the tax rebate rate for the shipbuilding sector from nine
to 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
For most shipbuilders, however, focusing on the domestic market
may be their best option.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that over the next four years, Chinese shipping
companies need at least 120 vessels, totalling about five million
dead weight tons, to replenish their current fleets and satisfy
newly emerging market demand.

<HEADLINE> Closer Scrutiny for Drugs Make Asiad One of Cleanest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December (Xinhua) -- High-tech and greater awareness
have made the 13th Asian Games one of the cleanest sports
extravaganzas in the world.
</P>
<P>
All drug tests for the two-week games, which is to close Sunday
night, were carried out with the most sophisticated tool
available. Only two turned positive.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot say whether it is the cleanest games, because we have
not conducted tests on every athlete, but we think so," said Dr
Ruangsak Siriphol, chairman of the Games Medical Committee, which
supervised drug testing.
</P>
<P>
There were only two drug cases involved a Jordanian and a
Kuwaiti weightlifter. Both men were not among the medal winners
when their drug-taking was discovered.
</P>
<P>
Jaber Tashid al-Ajimi of Kuwait, who finished 10th in the men's
over 105kg class on Monday, tested positive for the streroid
nandrolen.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's Ayed Jassar Khawalde, in the 56kg division, was
thrown out of the games after testing positive for triamterene,
a diuretic.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Games in 1994 in Hiroshima was tarnished by
widespread drug use including 11 positive tests by Chinese. Among
those Chinese failures, seven were swimmers.
</P>
<P>
Chinese swimmers further disgraced themselves in the world
swimming championships in Perth, Australia, in January, where four
tested positive for diuretics and the other caught in the Sydney
Customs for bringing human growth hormone.
</P>
<P>
Dr Ruangsak said more than 700 of nearly 7,000 athletes who
took part in the Bangkok Games were tested during the event.
</P>
<P>
He said the lack of drugs allowed the world to at last see
the true potential of Asian athletes.
</P>
<P>
"It means that the true potential of Asian athletes is the same
as in any other region in the world," Dr Ruangsak said.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Games used a half-million-dollars piece of
equipment called a carbon isotope ratio mass spectrometer.
</P>
<P>
The new technology, first used at the Winter Olympics in
Nagano, Japan, allows the laboratory to differentiate between
testosterone naturally produced by the body and that illicitly
ingested to boost muscle mass.
</P>
<P>
A cleaner games underlines that awareness against doping has
been raised in Asia.
</P>
<P>
International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio
Samaranch said days before the Asian Games that China set an
example in doping control and education.
</P>
<P>
Chinese athletes received random tests in the run-up to the
games. Blood tests, more rigorous than the standard urine tests,
were carried out in Chinese swimmers.
</P>
<P>
"We had tested the games-bound swimmers several times, none was
positive," said Chinese swimming head coach Zhang Xiong.
</P>
<P>
Shang Xiutang, Secretary General of the Chinese Athletics
Association, repeatedly reminded Chinese athletes not to take any
medication even though they had fever or cough.

KIEV, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian former Prime Minister
Pavel Lazarenko Saturday went back to his hometown Dnepropetrovsk
on a chartered plan after he was bailed out from a Geneva court.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax-Ukraine news agency said after a few days of rest,
Lazarenko would explain to the public why he was arrested in
Switzerland,.
</P>
<P>
The news agency said the Geneva court would bring him on trial

<P>
Lazarenko, carrying a Panamanian passport, was detained in
Basle on December 2. He was officially arrested in Geneva later on
charge of involvement in money laundering.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva court planned to detain him for another month, but
later decided to release him after receiving a bail of 4 million
Swiss Francs.
</P>
<P>
Lazarenko was prime minister from May 1996 to July 1997. He was
now leader of the opposition center-left Hromada party and a

<P>
"Tourism generates 500,000 direct and indirect jobs and this

Minister Jose Miguel Gamarra said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Gamarra said that from December 1997 to November of this year,
826,000 tourists arrived in Peru, adding that the whole year is
expected to see a total of 835,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 900,000 tourists mark is expected to be
surpassed in 1999, and that the big target of the government is to
receive one million tourists in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Quality is much more important than quantity, said Gamarra,
referring to the tourism development plan.
</P>
<P>
"World Tourism Organization studies show that for every tourist
who is not satisfied with his visit to a country, seven more will
not come, while for every satisfied visitor, only four more will
come. That is why it is so important to work for quality," he
said.

<P>
BANGKOK, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Olympic silver medalist Lee
Bong-Ju of South Korea overcame heat and humid to win the men's
marathon, the last event of the 13th Asian Games, here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Lee, 28, led all the way to win the Games' final gold with a
time of two hours 12 minutes 31 seconds. Japan's Manai Akira
finished second in 3:13:24 and DPR Korea's Kim Jung-Won third in
2:16:30.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy to get the last gold medal, though the time was
not very good. I have strong confidence to win from the start," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"At 35 kilometers, the Japanese chased me hard, but I have more
energy and was mentally powerful," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the heat and an old injury spoiled his hope of setting
a record.
</P>
<P>
"I have a long-time injury. I should have had a better race if
I had no injury. It was very cool after start at seven O'clock,
but it got really hot after the sun rose."
</P>
<P>
Manai had always trailed Lee by just one second before Lee
pulled away at 35km. The Japanese then faded and was out of
contention.
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough race. I wanted to go ahead but the South Korean
was a tough runner and much better than I," Manai said.
</P>
<P>
"I had expected to run a good time. But before the start I
changed my target to winning a medal because I could feel the
heat," he said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 14 runners competed in the race which was started in
Ayuttaya province, 40km on the north of Bangkok. But only 10
finished the Games' most grueling race of 42.195km.
</P>
<P>
Lam Weng-Hei of Macau became the last to cross the finish line
in 2:49:51, over 37 minutes after Lee won the gold medal.

<HEADLINE> Colombian President Welcomes Guerrilla Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Andres Pastrana on Saturday urged guerrilla forces to put money,
not gunfires, in the country's troubled zones, as the government
is drawing up a Plan Colombia to promote economic development.
</P>
<P>
"I invite the insurgent groups, for the good of the true
reconciliation of the Colombian people, to be present in the
preparation, formation, and implementation of the programs and
projects of the Plan Colombia," Pastrana said at a public meeting
in the northern town of Puerto Wilches.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, peasants in and around the town will receive
state financing for the cultivation of African palm. The plan
features support for the cultivation of alternative plants to
replace coca, marijuana, and opium poppy in several parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
"This is a serious and reliable invitation," Pastrana noted in
his message to the rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
The two biggest guerrilla forces, the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia and the National Liberation Army, have said
they are ready to negotiate a peaceful settlement to their
three-decade-old uprising that has cost 35,000 lives in the last
decade.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana said the guerrillas have agreed to abandon their
illegal drug business and engage in alternative economic
operations.
</P>
<P>
The plan also offers land compensations for peasants displaced
by armed conflicts, allowing them to either return home or to
resettle in new places.
</P>
<P>
The government has so far enlisted financial backing from the
Interamerican Development Bank and some 5,000 business people for
the Plan Colombia, which will be coordinated by the office of the
high commissioner for peace, Victor Ricardo.

STOCKHOLM, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Foreign Minister
Anna Lindh Saturday discussed with his French counterpart Hubert
Vedrine on U.N. role to solve the Iraqi issue.
</P>
<P>
She told reporters that she made a telephone conversation with
the French foreign minister on Saturday afternoon, but declined to

</P>
<P>
She said it is very important to exchange views on what
measures should the Security Council take after the United States

</P>
<P>
In an interview with a Swedish television earlier Saturday,
Lindh criticized the United States and Britain for their
unilateral action against Iraq, which bypassed the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
She said it would not work to strike a country with bombs to
prevent it from acquiring weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Now it is "very important" to let the U.N. weapons inspectors
return to Iraq, she said.

<HEADLINE> Would-be Buyers Put Off by Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey revealed that
Chinese urban residents have a strong desire to buy homes of their
own, but housing prices are still beyond their reach.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily (Business Weekly) said about 8.3 percent of
urban residents surveyed in Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing,
Guangzhou and Wuhan were prepared to buy their own homes in the
fourth quarter, rising from seven percent in the second quarter of
this year.
</P>
<P>
About 12.2 percent planned to buy homes in 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, majority of families are not capable
of affording even "economy" housing. In Beijing, economy housing
refers to homes priced at between 2,000 and 4,500 yuan (241-542
U.S. dollars) per square meter.
</P>
<P>
However, experts say housing prices will not drop dramatically
in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Lower prices will be decided by two factors: improvement in the
country's macro economy, and the implementation of government
preferential policies.
</P>
<P>
China's macro economy is expected to pick up in 1998 as a result
of the government's efforts to expand domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a series of preferential policies to lower
development costs and abolish unreasonable construction fees will
help cut prices.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of mortgage policies is important to help home
buyers, experts said.
</P>
<P>
About 37 percent of people said they would buy homes if they
could get a mortgage that covered 50 percent of the housing
cost. About 58 percent said they would buy homes if the mortgage
covered 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, the central bank, issued a circular
early this year urging commercial banks to earmark no less than 15
percent of their total loans to support housing construction and
consumption in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Chile to Request Arbitration in Pinochet Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Chile will ask the Human
Rights Interamerican Court of San Jose of Costa Rica for
arbitration on whether its lifetime Senator Augusto Pinochet
should be extradited to Spain.
</P>
<P>
Chilean Senate President Andres Saldivar made the announcement
on Saturday upon his return from Europe, where he advocated before
the European Parliament and the Spanish authorities for the
release of Pinochet, detained in London on October 16.
</P>
<P>
Saldivar said he was satisfied with his visit to Spain, where
he was received by the government leaders.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Chile is defending the right of its democratic
transition, he said his trip aimed to make "a political statement"
before all the agencies he visited as well as the Spanish media.
</P>
<P>
Britain's highest court, the House of Lords, will announce a
new decision by the middle of January about Pinochet's immunity.
It annulled its former decision on Thursday by a 5-0 vote,
ordering a new hearing on the case after the revelation that one
of its five ruling judges had ties with the human rights group
Amnesty International, which is campaigning for Pinochet's
extradition to Spain.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Chilean President Eduardo Frei said "it seems
logical that Senator Pinochet be allowed to return to Chile and to
allow us Chileans to decide our own affairs."

<HEADLINE> UK's Blair Confirms Ending of Air Attacks on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The air attacks on Iraq have
ended with all their objectives achieved, British Prime Minister
Tony Blair confirmed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Blair made the statement in his Downing Street office
simultaneously with U.S. President Bill Clinton, who was
announcing the end of the U.S.-British operation from the White
House.
</P>
<P>
"The last wave of air strikes on Iraq has just ended. The final
wave of British Tornados returned just before 10:00 pm (2200
GMT). All British and American aircrews have returned safely." he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister said it had always been envisaged that
Operation Desert Fox would last four days, because it "is the
right and proportionate response to Saddam's breach of
U.N. obligations and also because of our sensitivity to the holy
month of Ramadan."
</P>
<P>
"Our objectives have been achieved. We set out to diminish and
degrade Saddam's' military capability, and we have done
so ... Tonight significant parts of Saddam's military
infrastructure are in ruins."
</P>
<P>
He said that substantial damage was done to Iraq's air defence,
command and control, missile production, and systems which could
be used for chemical and biological warfare.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, there has been real damage done to the special
Republican Guard organization." the Prime Minister added.
</P>
<P>
However, Blair warned that Britain and America stood ready to
take military action if Saddam Hussein ever again defied his
international obligations.
</P>
<P>
"He should be in no doubt that we remain ready to act again...
as long as Saddam stays, the threat and our readiness to confront
it stays," Blair said.

HANGZHOU, December 20 (Xinhua) -- In spite of the negative
impact of the Asian financial crisis, east China's Zhejiang
Province has reported an increase in overseas investment in the
first ten months.
</P>
<P>
The provincial planning and economic commission reports 817
contracts with overseas investors, up 17 percent from the same
1997 period. The amount of committed overseas capital was up 60
percent to 1.52 billion U.S. dollars worth.

center for China's freshwater pearls, providing further avenues to
the international market. But, the continued growth in pearl
production has caused some nasty competition between local
producers and dealers, partly resulting in a decline in quality
and drop in price recently.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Hengyou, a specialist with the China Gem Association,
says that steps should be taken to integrate production,
processing, and marketing of pearls to guarantee healthy growth of
the industry.

<P>
JAKARTA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- There was no immediate plan to
hold the proposed meeting between Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie and former president Soeharto, Minister/State Secretary
Akbar Tanjung said on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting between Muslim leader Abdurrahman Wahid and
Soeharto at the latter's residence in Central Jakarta on Saturday,
the former president expressed his readiness to meet with his
successor Habibie, Minister of Defense/Armed Forces Chief Gen.
Wiranto and Wahid for a "dialogue that would determine the fate of
the nation".
</P>
<P>
Wahid, popularly known as Gus Dur, has spoken about the need
for national dialogue, citing the threat of social revolution
looming large in the country.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Wahid met Wiranto and Habibie separately, and they
agreed that a national dialogue is needed to solve national
problems and an earlier presidential election will be held
following general election on June 7 next year.
</P>
<P>
Habibie has previously turned down the plan to hold a national
dialogue among the country's top leaders, saying he doubted the
effectiveness of such a notion.
</P>
<P>
He softened his stance after meeting with Wahid, but added that
although national dialogue was important, there was no need to
formalize it.
</P>
<P>
Akbar told the state television network TVRI that Habibie
welcomed the meeting between Wahid and Soeharto to discuss a
number of issues related to the life of the nation.
</P>
<P>
The president also described as "a good step" towards solving
the nation's problems the series of meetings held by Wahid with
him and Wiranto recently, and with Soeharto on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Wahid, Chairman of the country's largest Islamic organization
Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), told reporters following the meeting with
Soeharto that the dialogue would be limited to the four, as
inviting too many people would prevent it from producing a
consensus.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, who had ruled Indonesia for 32 years, stepped down on
May 21 this year amid the serious political and economic crisis in
the country. But Wahid said the former president still has "real
power" because many people follow him.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Akbar stressed that the dialogue would not impede
efforts by the Attorney General's Office to investigate Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
"The mandate stipulated in the MPR (People's Consultative
Assembly) number 11/1998 regarding the investigation of officials
and pensioners over corrupt allegations must be implemented,"
Akbar was quoted by Antara News Agency Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The president had to implement a number of MPR decrees, Akbar
added.

<HEADLINE> Taxation Reform to Ease Burdens on Businesses, Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese think tank worked on
feasibility of reforms replacing administrative fees with taxes
and proposed solutions to problems relating to implementation of
the reforms.
</P>
<P>
"Road maintenance fees and vehicle purchase fees should be
replaced by a fuel tax, and an agricultural tax should take the
place of fees collected from farmers," today's Business Weekly
quoted a report as saying.
</P>
<P>
A think tank affiliated with the State Bureau of Taxation
recently submitted a research report to the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 fees are estimated to be imposed on motor vehicles
across the country.
</P>
<P>
The report also envisioned launch of two other taxes by the end
of 2000. Payments to unemployment funds, pension funds, medicare
funds, and for benefits for the disabled, will be channeled via a
social security tax. Extra education fees, previously levied on
enterprises running no schools, will be turned into a culture and
education tax.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of tax revenues to gross national product is expected
to rise by at least 1.5 percent if the proposals get the nod from
the State Council and are passed by the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The report suggested the next step be to implement an even
wider range of taxes instead of fees by 2010, including an
environmental protection tax, stock trading tax and land-use tax.
</P>
<P>
But some analysts say that the difficulties ahead will be
formidable in terms of legislation and practical application.
</P>
<P>
It would be unrealistic for millions of laid offs to pay social
security tax with their government-allocated subsistence wage.
</P>
<P>
And ministries, local governments and authorities would be
deprived of vast financial resources if the new taxes were
collected by the central government.

XI'AN, December 20 (Xinhua) -- A rare mushroom weighing over
7.5 kg and kept for more than ten years by a venerable Chinese
traditional doctor has been donated to medical institutes for
research today in Yangxian, northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Classified as a ganoderma, the huge fungus was put on public
display recently by Du Mingwen, from Guanxi Town in Yangxian
County, who found it growing originally in a forest in the
Qingling Mountains in 1984.
</P>
<P>
This type of fungus is used in traditional Chinese medicine and
is credited with miraculous powers as well as being considered a
symbol of good luck, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
"When I first picked the fungus it was 65 cm in diameter and
weighed 18.5 kilograms," said Dr Du.
</P>
<P>
"It is the largest fungus I have ever seen," added Du, who has
collected herbs in mountain areas for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Shusen, a professor of biology from Huanzhong
Teacher's College, the fungus is also of great value.

<HEADLINE> Beckenbauer: Brazil is German 2006 Rival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Franz Beckenbauer said Saturday
that neither Africa nor England, but rather Brazil, were
Germany's most dangerous rivals in the bidding race for the 2006
Football World Cup.
</P>
<P>
"I rate Brazil a much more dangerous rival for Germany than
England," Beckenbauer said in an interview with the Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
</P>
<P>
Beckenbauer, the German federation vice president and Bayern
Munich boss, had last week personally submitted Germany's bid to
host their second World Cup after 1974 to world governing body
FIFA boss Joseph Blatter.
</P>
<P>
The 2006 edition will be awarded by the 24-strong FIFA
executive board in March 2000. The current bidders besides
Germany are England, Brazil, Argentina, Ghana, Morocco and South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Blatter has repeatedly said he favoured the African continent
to finally host the World Cup. Beckenbauer said he agreed in
principle, but that the time was not yet ripe and that three
bidders were simply too many.
</P>
<P>
"The Africans are right to say it is their turn because all
other continents have already hosted the event. But the Africans
have three candidates, Morocco, Ghana and South Africa. That is
as harmful as the two European bidders Germany and England.
</P>
<P>
"I know South Africa and am therefore not sure if they will be
able by 2006 to have the infrastructure for a spectacle like the
World Cup with 32 teams," said Beckenbauer, who won the 1974
title with Germany as a player and again in 1990 as a coach.
</P>
<P>
Beckenbauer said the Germans should not look at the other
bidders but rather concentrate on their own efforts: "We have to
show the world that Germany is the best country to organise a
World Cup."
</P>
<P>
He said he did not expect England to withdraw their bid after
the recent manipulation scandal surrounding their Football
Association (FA) president Keith Wiseman, but said the English
were making a very different mistake.
</P>
<P>
"I do not want to criticise them, but the English are about to
shoot their bolt. It is much too early for a lot of noise. I belie
ve that the best final spurt will make the difference and for
that we have to save our energy," Beckenbauer said.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning to Fire Incompetent Factory Directors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The heavy-industry center of
Liaoning Province has decided to dismiss a number of incompetent
factory directors and managers before next February as part of its
effort to save money-losing state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The vacancies will be filled by younger and more professional
people with good modern management skills, according to provincial
authorities.
</P>
<P>
This decision comes at a crucial time, as the central
government is requiring that the northeast China province must
turn losses into profits in more than half of its state-owned
enterprises by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The province has the largest number of large and medium-sized
state-owned enterprises in the country--926 in all, most of
which are operating in the red.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning has decided to institute a system for assessing the
qualifications and performances of enterprise leaders early next
year.

<HEADLINE> UK's Blair Confirms Ending of Air Attacks on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The air attacks on Iraq have
ended with all their objectives achieved, British Prime Minister
Tony Blair confirmed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Blair made the statement in his Downing Street office
simultaneously with U.S. President Bill Clinton, who was
announcing the end of the U.S.-British operation from the White
House.
</P>
<P>
"The last wave of air strikes on Iraq has just ended. The final
wave of British Tornados returned just before 10:00 pm (2200
GMT). All British and American aircrews have returned safely." he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister said it had always been envisaged that
Operation Desert Fox would last four days, because it "is the
right and proportionate response to Saddam's breach of
U.N. obligations and also because of our sensitivity to the holy
month of Ramadan."
</P>
<P>
"Our objectives have been achieved. We set out to diminish and
degrade Saddam's' military capability, and we have done
so ... Tonight significant parts of Saddam's military
infrastructure are in ruins."
</P>
<P>
He said that substantial damage was done to Iraq's air defence,
command and control, missile production, and systems which could
be used for chemical and biological warfare.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, there has been real damage done to the special
Republican Guard organization." the Prime Minister added.
</P>
<P>
However, Blair warned that Britain and America stood ready to
take military action if Saddam Hussein ever again defied his
international obligations.
</P>
<P>
"He should be in no doubt that we remain ready to act again...
as long as Saddam stays, the threat and our readiness to confront
it stays," Blair said.

<HEADLINE> Southern China Expecting More Laborers From Flooded Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 20 (Xinhua) -- More transient laborers,
many of them from areas hit by this summer's devastating floods,
are expected to go to the economically booming Guangdong Province
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
A local official in charge of labor affairs made this
prediction at a recent provincial meeting on how to deal with
transient workers during the Spring Festival, the traditional
Lunar New Year.
</P>
<P>
There are now about 6 million people here in this "floating"
world from other parts of the country, and after the Spring
Festival is over, some will return bringing more friends and
relatives hoping to make more money. In addition, farmers from
flood-stricken areas are expected to leave their hometowns for
Guangdong and other areas to find ways to make a living.
</P>
<P>
The labor departments of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi and Anhui
provinces expect transient workers from their flood-damaged areas
to go to work in other parts of the country like Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
The Guangdong official has asked his province's labor
departments to be prepared for this possible influx and a
publicity effort is underway to encourage people from outside
Guangdong not to come here blindly.

JINAN, December 20 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province
saw the growth of its export sector resume in November, after 10
continuous months of decline.
</P>
<P>
According to customs statistics, Shandong delivered two million
tons of export commodities in November, up 8.2 percent from the
same month last year. Most of the shipments consisted of coal and
non-metal ores.
</P>
<P>
The total tonnage of export commodities from Shandong had
decreased by 11.6 percent in the first 10 months of this year due
to the negative effects of the Southeast Asian financial crisis.

<P>
BEIJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Residents in the Chinese
capital have not felt the strong cold air of winter for more than
a week as daytime temperatures have hovered around 10 degrees
Celsius.
</P>
<P>
The highest temperature on December 16 reached 13 degrees
Celsius, the highest for that date since 1940, according to the
Beijing Meteorological Station.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists attribute the high temperatures to a
combination of strong warm high pressure over north China and
cold air remaining far away.
</P>
<P>
Warm weather has resulted, however, in an increased number of
viral flu cases in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The warm weather is expected to remain for the next several
days, according to the experts from the meteorological
station.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Michael Jordan won't play
anymore and he will announce his retirement as soon as the NBA
lockout ends, said Charles Barkley today in Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
"Michael is done," Barkley said Saturday after a charity
exhibition game. "Let me tell you something, you can hope and
hope and hope, but Michael is gone.
</P>
<P>
"He's not going to play anymore. He's just waiting for the
lockout to end. Everybody keeps tring to make him play, or ask if
he will play if they shorten th season. But he has said from Day
1 he's not going to play. He wants this thing to end so he can
make it public."
</P>
<P>
Barkley said he played golf with Jordan last week and talked
about Jordan's future.
</P>
<P>
"Look, he has had enough. He's done everything. He made his
last shot to win a world championship. What more do you need?
That's every player's fantasy.
</P>
<P>
"Let the man enjoy the rest of his life. I'm more concerned
about the other 399 guys."
</P>
<P>
Barkley, who coaches the White team in today's exhibition
game, said he would like to play for a team looking like to win a
championship.
</P>
<P>
"I want to stay in Houston," he said. "If they sign Scottie
Pippen or Antonio McDyess, our team would be very good. The money
doesn't matter to me. The Knicks are a team I will consider."
</P>
<P>
Barkley will be a free agent when the lockout ends. He said he
has been in contact with six teams.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vows to Stay in Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Saturday he intends to stay in office "until the last hour of
the last day" of his term.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the House of Representatives approved two
articles of impeachment against the president: perjury before a
grand jury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
"I want the American people to know today that I am still
committed to working with people of good faith and good will of
both parties to do what's best for our country," Clinton said at a
White House event.
</P>
<P>
"We must get rid of the poisonous venom of excessive
partisanship, obsessive animosity and uncontrolled anger," said
Clinton, the second president in history to face impeachment trial
in Senate.
</P>
<P>
He said he accepted responsibility "for what I did wrong in my
personal life," and he criticized House Republicans for rejecting
his call for a punishment that was "reasonable, bipartisan and
proportionate."
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead to the prospects of the Senate trial on his
behavior in the Monica Lewinsky affair, Clinton said, "I hope
there will be a constitutional and fair means of resolving this
matter in a prompt manner."
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Democratic lawmakers burst into applause and
surrounded the president as he stepped onto a makeshift stage on
the South Lawn.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore called it "the saddest day."
</P>
<P>
Some 80 Democrats followed Clinton from a private East Room
meeting to the lawn.
</P>
<P>
"We will stay with you and fight with you until this madness is
over," Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of the House of
Representatives told the president.
</P>
<P>
Clinton asked the American people "to move with me" and to
"rise above the rancor."

<HEADLINE> Shandong to Accelerate Highway Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 20 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province
plans to allocate over 75 billion yuan for highway construction
over the next five years, according to Governor Li Chunting.
</P>
<P>
Some 53.9 billion yuan, or 20 percent more than total
investment in the transportation sector over the 10 years, will go
for the construction of expressways, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
He said Shandong's expressway system will stretch some 2,700 km
by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
Shandong's 1997 investments in highway construction hit 15
billion yuan, a figure equal to approximately 8.3 percent of the
national total for the year.
</P>
<P>
Shandong, one of China's leading economic powerhouses, is
widely recognized for its relatively advanced highway system. The
province has expanded its highway system by an average 2,000 km
annually over the past 10 years. The province's highway system
covered 59,300 km by the end of last year, including expressways
stretching 833 kilometers.

Clinton called anew for the removal of Saddam Hussein,
saying "so long as Saddam remains in power, he will remain a
threat to his people, his region and the world. With our allies
we must pursue a strategy to contain him and to constrain his
weapons of mass destruction program."

rebuilding its weapons program."

House of Representatives voted to impeach him earlier in the
day.
</P>
<P>
"I will continue to do my job for the American People," said
Clinton at the White House with Democratic Lawmakers behind him.
</P>
<P>
"We must stop the politics of personal destruction," Clinton
said. "We have important work to do."
</P>
<P>
The House impeached Clinton for lying under oath and
obstructing justice about his relationship with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky, voting largely along party lines to send
his case to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that he hoped for fair, reasonable, prompt
resolution in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The president avoided any attacks on Republicans in his
remarks.
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by dozens of Democratic defenders, President Clinton
ignored calls for his resignation in the face of impeachment
Saturday, vowing to remain in office "until the last hour of my
last day of my term." Joining calls for an end to bitter
partisanship, he declared, "We must stop the politics of personal
destruction."
