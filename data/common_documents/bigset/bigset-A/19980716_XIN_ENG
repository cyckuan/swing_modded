<HEADLINE> Pakistani Envoy Holds Talks With Taliban Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Special Envoy on
Afghanistan Iftikhar Murshid held in-depth talks with the Afghan
Taliban militia Wednesday on various options to restore durable
peace in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Murshid arrived in Afghanistan's southern city of Kandahar, a
stronghold of the Taliban, Wednesday as part of Pakistan's
diplomatic efforts to bring the militia and the opposition
Northern Alliance to the negotiation table, official sources said
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Mullah Muhammad Omar, the supreme
leader of the Taliban, Murshid briefed him about his recent visit
to Iran and his talks with Iranian officials on the Afghan issue,
according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Murshid visited Iran last week. He held consultations with
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi and Iranian envoy on
Afghanistan Alaedin Boroujerdi on the Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
The consultations were follow-ups of a Pakistan-Iran joint team
visit to Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan and Kandahar on
June 30 and July 1, where the team held talks with leaders of the
Northern Alliance and the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that there was a proposal that the next joint
Pakistan-Iran team comprise the two Pakistani and Iranian envoys
on Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Murshid also discussed with the Taliban leader the possibility
of the next Pakistan-Iran joint team's visit to Kandahar, the
sources said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Views Bailout Loans as "Most Favorable" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia is receiving bailout loans
from international bodies "on the most favorable terms," said
Russian Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the State Duma, the lower house of parliament,
Zadornov said: "More favorable credits than these (loans) ever
issued by international financial organizations do not exist."
</P>
<P>
The Russian government said on Monday it would get 22.6 billion
U.S. dollars from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World
Bank and Japan in 1998 through 1999 to help rescue the economy.
</P>
<P>
The IMF loans will be disbursed in three tranches with yearly
interest rates ranging from 4.6 to 4.8 percent, Zadornov said.
</P>
<P>
The first tranche will be repaid in five years and the second
in 10 years. And during these years, he said, Russia will pay
only the interest, not the principal.
</P>
<P>
Loans from the Japanese government are even more favorable,
with a repayment period of 17 years and an annual interest rate of
2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government will use 3 to 4 billion dollars of the
foreign loans to repay its state debts, the finance minister said.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the loans will help make up Russia's foreign
reserves. In the event of any future financial turmoil, the
Russian Central Bank can at any moment apply 5 billion dollars
from its foreign reserves to stabilize the market, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The goal of the accords (with international bodies) is
single," he said, elaborating that it is not to support the budget
but make up our foreign reserves to secure financial stability.
</P>
<P>
As the ITAR-TASS news agency reported, the Duma is debating
laws necessary to approve the package of austerity program the
government has put forth.
</P>
<P>
Many Duma deputies disagree with the government on receiving
foreign loans, fearing that Russia will have to rely on
international organizations heavier than ever.
</P>
<P>
Zadornov was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying that
the first 5.6 billion dollars of the IMF loans is due to arrive
this month and a Japanese loan of 400 million dollars will come
this week.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Business Inventories Dip in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. business inventories
in May declined 0.1 percent to 1.07 trillion U.S. dollars, marking
the first drop since a similar fall in June 1996, the Commerce
Department report here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The decline followed a record buildup in inventories during the
first three months of this year, when businesses were increasing
105.7 billion dollars in stockpiles at an annual rate. It was that
gain that propelled overall economic growth to a robust 5.4
percent annual rate from January through March.
</P>
<P>
Without the huge buildup in inventories, economic growth would
have been a much slower 3.7 percent in the first three months of
the year.
</P>
<P>
Today's reported decline in inventories supports some
economists' forecast that growth slowed dramatically in the second
quarter with some analysts believing the gross domestic product
was growing at an annual rate of just 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
As a result of economic crisis in Asia, U.S. manufacturers and
farmers are losing sales to Asia, a region that buys one-third of
total U.S. exports, and American manufacturers are facing
increased competition from Asian goods made cheaper because of the
decline in currency values.
</P>
<P>
The decline in total business inventories displayed a 1 percent
cutback in stockpiles being held by retailers. That was the
biggest decline since 1 percent in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
Inventories held by manufacturers edged up a slight 0.1 percent
while inventories at the wholesale level climbed 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The inventory report showed that total sales in May edged up
0.1 percent after a 0.3 percent decline in April. That increase
reflected a 0.4 percent drop in sales by manufacturers, a 0.3
percent decline in sales by wholesalers and the 1.2 percent
increase in sales at the retail level.
</P>
<P>
The overall 0.1 percent rise in sales and the 0.1 percent drop
in inventories was not enough to change the inventory-to-sales
ratio, which remained at 1.38 months. That means it would take
that long to deplete all inventories at the May sales pace. The
ratio had been 1.38 months in April and also in May a year ago.

<P>
LONDON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Four suspected Irish republicans
appeared in court on Wednesday charged over last Friday's alleged
terrorist bomb plot in London.
</P>
<P>
The three men and one woman -- Darren Mulholland, Liam Patrick
Gregory, Anthony Harland and Elaine Moore -- were remanded in
custody in London's top security Belmarsh prison.
</P>
<P>
They were charged with bombing central London after police
found six fire bombs primed to go off during Friday afternoon's
rush hour. Police said the suspects were arrested minutes before
the bombs were set to explode.
</P>
<P>
The defendants, who did not speak during their brief court
appearance, were separated from one another by lines of police
officers at the court.
</P>
<P>
Police said the arrests were the result of a joint
investigation in Britain and Ireland into "dissident criminal
Irish Republican terrorist groups" that included a surveillance
operation.
</P>
<P>
A total of 10 people were arrested after the attempted attacks
on Friday in both Britain and the Irish Republic during the joint
operation, but six were released later.

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Housing for College Faculty Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The State Council, China's highest
governing body, plans to allocate an additional two billion yuan
(about 240 million U.S. dollars) to transform rundown housing at
colleges directly under central government departments in order to
provide improved living conditions for faculty members.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a work conference on the transformation of rundown
buildings on college campuses, Vice-Premier Li Lanqing pledged to
accomplish the work within two years.
</P>
<P>
This is an important measure in implementing the strategy of
invigorating the nation through science and education, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China,
stressed that officials with concerned departments must exert
greater efforts to ensure the removal of rundown housing buildings
prior to the advent new century.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, China has invested over 60 billion yuan in the
construction of housing for teachers and college staffers working
in urban areas. The average per capita housing space grew from
6.9 sq.m. in 1993 to 8.45 sq.m. by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, teachers and staffers continue to face
difficulties related to housing. For example, young married
college teachers are forced to live in buildings lacking adequate
kitchen and toilet facilities.
</P>
<P>
China initiated a program to transform rundown college housing
in the latter half of 1997, said Li, adding that the Ministry of
Finance has allocated more that 150 million yuan for related
during the first half of this year.

<HEADLINE> Iran: Security Council Indecisive on Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Wednesday criticized the
United Nations Security Council for not taking a decisive action
against Israeli's controversial plan to expand Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi told the official
news agency IRNA that lack of a decisive stance by the Security
Council has encouraged Israel's expansionism.
</P>
<P>
He condemned the Israeli expansion plan and its "expansionist
policy," which he said has worsened the crisis and insecurity in
the occupied territories as well as the whole Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council issued a presidential statement Monday
night, calling on Israeli government to stop its "serious and
damaging" plan to expand Jerusalem, a violation of the Oslo accord.
</P>
<P>
Israel on Tuesday rejected the U.N. statement and pledged to
continue its plan to create a greater Jerusalem, while the
Palestinians expressed regret that the Security Council failed to
take concrete action to stop the Israeli scheme.
</P>
<P>
The council failed to vote on an Arab-sponsored resolution
condemning Israel, due to the obstruction by the U.S. and Britain,
but compromised on a watered-down presidential statement, which is
non-binding and does not carry the same weight as a resolution.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi called on the world community, international
organizations and Islamic countries to "decisively deal with the
expansionist measures" of the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Experience has shown that inaction by the world community
vis-a-vis Israel's expansionism has only made the regime more
persistent in its policies, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent statement by former Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres intimating that Israel possesses nuclear
arms, the spokesman said this was indicative of "a policy to force
acceptance of the occupation of Muslim lands by using the threat
of nuclear arms in the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
"The policies of the Zionist regime are testimony to its war
mongering nature and also its opposition to peace and security in
the Middle East," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Donate 25,000 Tons of Wheat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican government signed an
agreement here Wednesday with the United States government under
which the U.S. will donate 25,000 tons of wheat to the southern
African country.
</P>
<P>
The wheat, worth five million U.S. Dollars, is aimed to
support Mozambican government's balance of payment, according to
a news communique issued by the U.S. embassy in Maputo.
</P>
<P>
Once the wheat is sold in the country, the money collected
will be used for development programs, said the communique.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. grain assistance to Mozambique in 1998 will be 99,000
tons, with a total value of 28 million Dollars, whereas in 1997,
the assistance was 88,000 tons with a value of about 25 million
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Frances Rodrigues, deputy foreign minister of Mozambique, and
Brian Dean Curran, U.S. Ambassador to Mozambique, signed the
agreement on behalf of their respective government.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. suspended its grain assistance in 1996 due to the
disappearance of a few thousand tons of rice in the Maputo port,
and restored its supply last year when the grain thief was
punished by the Mozambican government.

<HEADLINE> New Software Makes Computer Networking Easier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Sun Microsystems Inc., a
competitor of software giant Microsoft, is to introduce new
software that it says will make computer connection as easy as
plugging in a phone.
</P>
<P>
If successful, the Jini technology by Sun Microsystems could
boost the market for interconnected consumer products ranging from
cell phones and digital assistants to home appliances that would
all talk with each other.
</P>
<P>
It also could let computers easily share information and
computing power, The New York Times said.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Jini, which uses Son's Java programming
language, could be introduced as early as today, while the San
Jose Mercury News reported today that Sun expects to make its
first release by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Accessory devices such as data-storage units, scanners and
printers today are often linked directly to a single PC, or may be
shared only by PCs that use the same operating system, such as
Microsoft's Windows.
</P>
<P>
With Jini, devices have more intelligence to communicate with
others along a network, said a researcher of the project. They can
be more easily shared by all the computers on that network,
including those that use different operating systems.
</P>
<P>
In effect, different devices could operate together almost as
if they were a single computer, without having another computer
acting as traffic police.
</P>
<P>
Sun said several computer-storage and printer companies,
including Seagate Technology Inc., phone maker Ericsson, and
Japan's Canon Inc., are evaluating the Jini technology.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) is planning a meeting later this
month to consider progress in removing landmines in the
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The conference, being organized by SADC's Demining Committee,
is expected to take place in Maputo, capital of Mozambique,
Southern African Broadcasting Association (SABA) reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to SADC's Executive Secretary Kaire Mbuende, so far
only Mauritius, Mozambique and South Africa have ratified the
international convention banning the lethal devices.
</P>
<P>
The SADC has 14 member states. In addition to Mauritius,
Mozambique and South Africa, there are also Angola, Botswana,
Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, Seychelles, Swaziland,
Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Namibia recently decided to endorse the treaty to prevent
stock-piling, transfer and use of anti-personnel mines. However,
President Sam Nujoma's administration has not yet certified it.
</P>
<P>
The SADC region has recruited a specialist to coordinate a
program to clear the lethal devices under a technical cooperation
program between the European Union and the SADC.
</P>
<P>
Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe still have landmines hidden under
their soils. The anti-personnel mines were left behind after the
victories of nationalist war against colonial regimes.

to stop kidnappings while making other efforts to help end the
country's 34-year civil conflict.
</P>
<P>
Under a 21-point accord reached between leftist rebels of
Colombia's National Liberation Army and some 50 representatives of
Colombian political parties, churches and trade unions, the rebel
group had agreed not to hold hostages for ransom and to stop
planting landmines, negotiators said at a news conference after
the talks.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks, brokered by the German Roman Catholic Church,
were held behind closed door in the southern German city of
Wuerzburg.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators also agreed to take concrete steps to protect human
rights and to build pubic facilities like schools and clinics.
</P>
<P>
Both sides at the talks described the accord Wednesday as a
breakthrough and the first step towards a comprehensive peace
agreement in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
However, a German church official involved in the talks, Rev.
Hans Langendoerfer, warned at the news conference in Mainz that a
viable compromise would only be possible when the Colombian
government and other parties to the conflict were also involved.
</P>
<P>
The talks with the National Liberation Army came after an
historic direct meeting in the Colombian jungle last week between
Colombia's president-elect, Andres Pastrana, and leaders of the
largest Colombian rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana, the Conservative former mayor of Bogota, was elected
Colombia's new president last month and will be sworn in on August
7. He has vowed to begin negotiations with the rebel groups in a
bid to put an end to the country's civil conflict that has claimed
more than 30,000 lives over more than 30 years.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Cuba
resumed Wednesday direct passenger charter flights after a
two-year break.
</P>
<P>
A United Airlines aircraft, chartered by ABC Charters, left
Miami International Airport with around 200 passengers and landed
at Havana International Airport some 50 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton canceled direct fights in 1996
after Cuba downed two American civilian aircraft. He lifted the
ban on direct flights in March after Pope John Paul II visited
Cuba in January.
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba remains in place,
the Treasury Department has approved nine companies to resume
direct flight. ABC is one of the companies.
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, flights to Cuba had to stop in the
Bahamas or Mexico, increasing flight time to three hours or more
from 45 minutes.

LAGOS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian head of state General
Abdulsalam Abubakar Wednesday ordered the dissolution of the
three transition institutions, according to a government
statement.
</P>
<P>
The Transition Implementation Committee, the National

The announcement followed the dissolution of Abacha's cabinet
by Abubakar a week ago.

<HEADLINE> EU Envoy to Visit Cyprus Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU)'s envoy for
Cyprus David Hannay will visit Cyprus next week to discuss the
Cyprus problem, British High Commissioner to Cyprus David Madden
said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with President Glafcos Clerides,
Madden said David, who is also Britain's special envoy on Cyprus,
will come to the island to discuss issues pertaining to the Cyprus
problem, including the resumption of peace talks, Cyprus' EU
accession process and Cyprus' decision to purchase Russian-made
S-300 anti-aircraft missile system.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it is important for David to visit Cyprus during
the Austrian presidency of the EU. Austria took over the rotating
presidency of the EU as of July 1 from Britain.
</P>
<P>
Asked if it is feasible to overcome the obstacles placed by
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash for resumption of peace
talks, Madden said "we shall continue efforts in coordination
with others, and try to do our best to ensure that the
U.N. process can be resumed with direct meetings."
</P>
<P>
Denktash walked out of a U.N.-sponsored peace talks with
Clerides last summer in Switzerland to protest against the EU
decision to start accession talks with the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader has said that he would not return to
the negotiating table unless he gains recognition of his breakaway
entity in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He has also said he would not participate in negotiations
unless Cyprus withholds its application for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
Madden said that "it is possible to envisage a resumption of
direct talks and I hope we will be able to find the conditions
that will make that possible."
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council has very recently reset the framework,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council resolution 1179, adopted last month,
reaffirms that a Cyprus settlement must be based on a state of
Cyprus with a single sovereignty and international personality and
a single citizenship, with its independence and territorial
integrity safeguarded, and comprising two politically equal
communities in a bicommunal and bizonal federation.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also supports U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's mission of good offices and for the efforts of his special
adviser on Cyprus to resume a sustained process of direct
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" in the north, which is recognized
only by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Russian Communists Withdraw from Round-Table Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Communists on Wednesday
stated that they will no longer participate in round-table
meetings with the executive branch, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov confirmed at a press
conference that his party "has never been pleased" with the
government's policy and gave up the idea of round-table
discussions in March.
</P>
<P>
Zyganov pointed out that because Russian President Boris
Yeltsin has not kept his word to convene roundtable meetings
regularly for discussion of the country's most urgent issues, the
Communist leaders will not attend them.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Tuesday's discussion was not a round table,
but a "usual working meeting" and demanded that all further
meetings be recorded by shorthand typists so that no one could
distort deputies' views.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party leader said impeachment proceedings are
under way, and the documents justifying their commencement have
already been considered by 22 and approved by 14 regions.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Yeltsin met with Duma leaders in the Kremlin and
discussed with them the stabilization program.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov's deputy Valentin Kuptsov, who was also at the press
conference, blasted the media, above all TV stations, for
misreporting the Tuesday meeting between parliamentary party
leaders and Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
He rejected the statement made by Kremlin representatives that
"peace has been restored" with the opposition or that the
government and the opposition "are working as one team".

<HEADLINE> Romanian Leader Appeals to U.S. on NATO Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu appealed to the United States on Wednesday to
support his country's bid to join the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the House of Representatives Chamber on Capital
Hill, Constantinescu expressed his hope that the U.S. help it
develop as an anchor in the unstable Balkans.
</P>
<P>
"But for that anchor to keep steady, we need the acknowledgment
and support of the United States of America," Constantinescu said.
"We, the people of Romania, have earned it."
</P>
<P>
Congressional support is crucial to Romania, seeking inclusion
in the next group of countries to join NATO. NATO enlargement
supporters on Capitol Hill say the expanded alliance will
contribute to stability and security in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Critics contend it could entangle the United States in a series
of Bosnia-style peacekeeping missions.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Constantinescu said his country welcomes the
chance "to share our part of the burden of securing a peaceful
future for all of Europe."
</P>
<P>
Romania and Slovenia are the two countries considered most
likely to be chosen first in a second wave of expansion of the
NATO after Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic join the
alliance next year.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton, who has vowed to keep NATO's door open
to further expansion, visited Bucharest last July to show his
support for the country's reforms as well as the country's
application for NATO membership.
</P>
<P>
No time has been set for a further expansion, but it is
estimated that it will likely happen soon after the three new
members are inducted into the alliance next year.

UNITED NATIONS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of the
United Nations on Wednesday decided to extend the mandate of the
United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka for a further
period of time until January 15, 1999.
</P>
<P>
In its resolution unanimously adopted, the Security Council
called on the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia to take further steps to reduce tension and improve

</P>
<P>
The Council reiterated its call upon the parties to cease

</P>
<P>
The Security Council urged the parties to abide by their
mutual commitments and to implement fully the Agreement on
Normalization of Relations between the two countries, in
particular their commitment to reach a negotiated resolution to
the disputed issue of Prevlaka in accordance with the Agreement.
</P>
<P>
It requested the U.N. Secretary-General to submit to the

LONDON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The British government announced
Wednesday it would contribute one million pounds (about 1.6
million U.S. dollars) to Holocaust survivors in Britain and some
eastern European countries.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a statement issued

be used to provide medical assistance to Nazi Holocaust survivors
in Russia, Moldova, the Ukraine and Belarus.
</P>
<P>
The other money will be contributed to the Board of Deputies of
British Jews to help Holocaust survivors in Britain, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
"We all have a responsibility to ensure that people who
survived the greatest crime of our century do not live out their
remaining years in poverty," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that this announcement will encourage countries which
have not yet contributed to the International Fund to do so," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar's External Trade Volume Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The volume of trade between
the Zanzibar isles and foreign countries increased last year when
goods worth 6,779.87 million Shillings (about 10.2 U.S. Dollars)
were exported compared to 2,774.46 million Shillings (4.18
Dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Trade, Marketing and Industry, Khamis Ahmada
Mussa, told the Zanzibar House of Representatives Monday evening
that the bumper clove harvest contributed to the increase in the
trade volume.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here Wednesday, Mussa said the
bulk of imports included foodstuffs, drinks, petroleum products,
industrial raw materials, veterinary and human medicine,
machinery, construction and electrical appliances and transport
facilities.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of exports from the isles was made up of seaweed,
fish, octopus, prawns and spices including curry, ginger,
cinnamon and chillies.
</P>
<P>
Mussa told the house that in 1997 the volume of imports was
less than that of exports. He urged local manufacturers to
improve the standard and quality of their products in an effort
to promote exports.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the trade between Zanzibar and Mainland
Tanzania went on well despite some problems arising from
harmonization of customs tariffs between the two sides. He said
the issue is being handled by the concerned authorities and
expected to be amicably solved.
</P>
<P>
Mussa named the bulk of products in trade between the isles
and the mainland as electric and electronic goods, agricultural
produce, skins and industrial products including construction
materials.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will carry out a special program to motivate
small-scale industrial manufacturers to produce goods which are
competitive in markets both at home and abroad, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, 27 production groups will be provided with
modern technologies.
</P>
<P>
Mussa asked the house to approve his ministry's 1998/99
estimates amounting to 310.356 million Shillings for recurrent
expenditure and 10 million Shillings for industrial development.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Urges Stakeholders to Protect Children's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Vice-President Christon
Tembo Wednesday appealed to service providers and other
stakeholders to channel their resources to the protection and
promotion of children's rights, according to Zambia News Agency
ZANA.
</P>
<P>
Opening a national consultative workshop on children in need
held in Lusaka Wednesday morning, Tembo acknowledged that the
country's economic restructuring program and AIDS pandemic have
adversely affected the Zambian children.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for children to have unlimited access to
education and food security if they are to be moulded into future
leaders of the nation.
</P>
<P>
"Zambian children must be given unlimited access to education
and health services while they are provided with maximum
protection against all forms of abuse," Tembo said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 50,000 Zambian children can not have the access to
education due to various reasons and more than 25,000 children
are roaming about in the streets begging.
</P>
<P>
Tembo also called on members of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) to interact and collaborate in
dealing with common problems such as the plight of children.
</P>
<P>
He said SADC members must through their various joint
permanent commissions exchange experiences and work out common
approach in dealing with the problems.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same function, William Harrington, Minister of
Youth, Sport and Child Development, said that while Zambia has
made great strides in protecting children's rights, a lot still
needs to be done in curbing child abuse.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Zambia's future is dependent on the
quality of life being offered to children and the youth.

<HEADLINE> Egypt-U.S. Aid Program Talks to Begin on Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and the United States will
start talks Thursday on the U.S.-Egypt aid program in light of the
U.S. intention to cut the aid in the future, Egypt's Middle East
News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The discussions will center on the possibility of replacing the
volume of aid to be cut with an increased joint trade, a
suggestion floated by several Egyptian ministers who visited
Washington in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
During the coming months, an array of talks will be held in
both Cairo and Washington.
</P>
<P>
At his meeting Wednesday with the members of the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce in Cairo, Richard Brown, the new director of the
U.S. Agency of International Development (USAID), said he is due
to meet Thursday with Egyptian Minister of State for Planning and
International Cooperation Zafer Al Beshri on the aid topic.
</P>
<P>
The USAID will attempt to cement trade relations with Egypt
over the coming period, added Brown.
</P>
<P>
The USAID chief said his country will, by the end of this year,
establish the first economic and trade base in Egypt for providing
Egyptian businessmen and companies with information helping them
increase exports.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the necessity of increasing foreign investments
in Egypt through reducing customs duties and raising saving rates.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Washington, the U.S. administration has piled
pressures on the Senate and House of Representatives to endorse a
13.5 billion U.S. dollar-foreign aid budget for the coming fiscal
year, while the committees concerned wanted to ratify only 12.5
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The current U.S. foreign aid budget includes 815 million
dollars to Egypt, while a possible new aid program will take
effect after June next year.
</P>
<P>
Congressional sources said that there are suggestions that
Washington's economic aid to Egypt be cut by 40 million dollars
annually.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who is visiting the U.S.,
has met with a number of U.S. officials to discuss suggestions on
the U.S. economic aid. Moussa said that Egypt wants the cuts to be
gradual, allowing the two sides to establish a free trade zone and
encourage joint investments.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Administration to Fight Starr's Secret Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
Wednesday challenged Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's demand
that members of President Bill Clinton's Secret Service testify
before the Monica Lewinsky grand jury.
</P>
<P>
Justice Departments lawyers and prosecutors from Starr's office
met privately for about an hour Wednesday afternoon in the
chambers of U.S. District Judge Norma Johnson, who oversees the
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
A government official told The Associated Press earlier the
department would file a court challenge to the new subpoenas to
the Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
Starr also subpoenaed six uniformed officers and demanded that
the agency turn over documents detailing the president's nighttime
whereabouts from 1995 through 1997, the years Lewinsky was a White
House intern and a Pentagon staffer.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's personal lawyers, Robert Bennett and David Kendall,
were quoted by the Associated Press as saying, "Any backdoor
attempt by this prosecutor to invade the president's right to
consult with personal counsel will be aggressively and firmly
resisted."
</P>
<P>
At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Chairman Orrin Hatch
said he is "extremely dismayed" that the Justice Department seeks
further court appeals to keep Secret Service personnel from
testifying.
</P>
<P>
Hatch declared the department had "concocted" the argument that
Secret Service personnel don't have to testify because of a
protective function privilege. The Clinton administration's
pursuit of the case "calls into serious question the real
motivations of both the Department of Justice and the Secret
Service," said Hatch, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday the Justice Department sought further appeal of
court decisions that declared the prosecutor is entitled to
evidence from the agency sworn to protect the president.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department is seeking a review by the full U.S.
Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia Circuit of the ruling
of a week ago by three appeals court judges.
</P>
<P>
Starr and the Clinton administration are engaged in a court
battle to determine whether Secret Service employees can be
compelled to divulge what they observe while protecting the
president.

BONN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The second largest Colombian rebel
group concluded a four-day peace talks with the country's
non-governmental representatives Wednesday in Germany by agreeing
to stop kidnappings while making other efforts to help end the
country's 34-year civil conflict.

Both sides at the talks described the accord Wednesday as a

<HEADLINE> Sudan Government Accepts Ceasefire with Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government has
declared to accept a ceasefire starting Wednesday with rebel group
the Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA) commanded by John
Garang.
</P>
<P>
The ceasefire, brokered by Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi,
was to allow the delivery of humanitarian relief supplies to
hundreds of thousands of starving people in the war-torn southern
areas.
</P>
<P>
The government avoided direct reference to the duration of the
ceasefire. Mio had requested for it to last a month, but the SPLA
has declared earlier Wednesday a unilateral three-month ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The SPLA limited the truce to areas "afflicted by famine" and
said it has nothing to do with issues of war and peace in southern
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
This stance drew criticism from chief coordinator of the
Southern provinces, Riak Mashar, who said the SPLA's limiting
truce to Bahr AlGhazal and Upper Nile states only is to continue
fighting with government troops in other areas.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail said in an
interview Wednesday that the government hoped the ceasefire could
pave the way for the next round of negotiations in Ethiopian
capital Addis Ababa in August.
</P>
<P>
Their previous two rounds of peace negotiations last October
and April for an end to the 15-year-old civil war ended in Kenyan
capital Nairobi without any breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
The Garang movement is the only rebel group continuing fighting
the government for autonomy of the predominantly Christian and
animist region from the Muslim north. In April last year, six
rebel factions signed a peace treaty with the government to end
their armed struggle.

<HEADLINE> Assad to Seek French Mediation in Peace-Making </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad will
begin a three-day state visit to France from Thursday to seek
French mediation in peace-making between his country and Israel.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first time for President al-Assad to visit
France in particular and a western country in general, since his
previous visit to Paris 22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The visit comes at a time when the Middle East peace process
remains completely deadlocked while peace talks between Syria and
Israel had been suspended since 1995.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the French TF1 television channel which
was broadcast Wednesday evening, al-Assad said that Syria hopes
that France and the European Union play a role in the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Before, the conditions were not favorable... But now, France
and the European Union have the right and even the duty to play a
role, this is in their interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shareh
in early June in Paris, French President Jacques Chirac said that
France and Syria were living a most positive period of time.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine has also indicated that
that France wishes to contribute to an improvement of the
situation of and even a solution to the confrontation between
Syria and Lebanon for one side, and Israel for the other.
</P>
<P>
He said that France is ready to mediate between Syria, lebanon
and Israel to help them better understand the positions of each
other.
</P>
<P>
France has recently arranged the exchange of the remains of the
dead in the conflict between Lebanon and Israel, as a gesture to
help them seek a relaxation of the tension on their border.
</P>
<P>
The visit could also be aimed at seeking economic cooperations
with the European Union.

<HEADLINE> Libya Says Relations with France Will Improve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The relations between Libya and
France will improve, a Libyan government minister who was the
first to visit France in eight years, said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The relations between the two countries were reduced to the
minimum since the explosion of a French passenger plane above
Niger in 1989, in which Paris suspected Libyan involvement.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan Minister of Planning Jadallah Azouz al-Talhi, who
was received by French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, said that
the Libyan-French relations have seen some positive evolution
recently.
</P>
<P>
He said that both of the two countries wish that relation will
improve.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux said that
France and Libya are studying what can be accomplished in
bilateral relations while respecting the United Nations Security
Council resolutions on Libya.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed economic sanctions, including
an air flight ban, on the North African nation in the early 1990s
for its alleged support of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
France is seeking to increase economic cooperations with Libya
and is interested in the country's oil resources.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Criticizes EU Decision on Turkish Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Minister of Agriculture
Mustafa Tasar Wednesday accused the European Union (EU) of
suspending preferred treatment on certain Turkish goods, Turkey's
Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing representatives of agricultural chambers at his
ministry's building, Tasar said that the EU decision should be
seen as "a retaliation" against previous Turkish ban on EU meat
products.
</P>
<P>
The EU recently decided to suspend privileges bestowed on
Turkey on tomato ketchup, watermelon and hazelnut, triggering
harsh reactions among Turkey's farmers.
</P>
<P>
Defending Turkey's ban on EU meat, Tasar said that this move
was taken to protect people's health.
</P>
<P>
The minister also accused those merchants who continue
importing EU meat of not applying to the Ministry of Agriculture
for approval.
</P>
<P>
Tasar denied allegations that a powerful lobby, in order to
keep high meat price on domestic market, was trying to prevent
meat imports from the EU member countries.
</P>
<P>
State Minister Isin Celebi had reportedly said that the ban on
EU meat led to the increasing smuggling of unqualified livestock
products across the southeastern border areas.
</P>
<P>
"We do not have to have our people eat diseased meat," said
Tasar, stressing that all the border provinces in the east had
been warned against smuggling of unhealthy meat.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Turkish Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchange
Chairman Murat Miras also called on the Turkish government to put
quotas on certain EU goods in response to EU decision on the
above-mentioned Turkish goods.
</P>
<P>
"It would be useful if we would sit down around a table and
talk about this issue rationally with the related ministers," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has attached special importance to its economic and
trade cooperation with the EU but this relationship has been
undermined due to recent row over Turkey's EU membership bid.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Urges Free Elections in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Wednesday called on the Cambodian authorities to ensure a
free atmosphere for the elections due on July 26.
</P>
<P>
He welcomes the progress achieved in Cambodia's electoral
process and he is satisfied with freedom of movement and guarantee
of security enjoyed by international and national observers, Annan
said in a statement issued through his spokesman here.
</P>
<P>
However, he "remains concerned by discrepancies in access
enjoyed by opposition parties to the media and by persistent
reports of intimidation and impunity", the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Due to great importance he attaches to the elections the
Secretary-General called for an atmosphere free from fear and
intimidation, guarantee of ballot secrecy to the voters and
impartial access to news media by campaigners.
</P>
<P>
He said the United Nations remains committed to all possible
assistance to Cambodia for free and fair elections.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission in Cambodia, set up since last October, has 40
persons now. The U.N. role in Cambodia is to coordinate
international observation, according to a U.N. senior official who
briefed reporters on condition of anonymity on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It will be the Joint International Observers Group (JIOG) which
will announce whether the elections are fair, and the U.N.
Secretary-General can express his own views on other occasions,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
About 300 international observers are expected to arrive in
Cambodia by the weekend. The army and policy are only allowed to
stay 300 meters away from the 11,000 polling stations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The official expects the new government to be a coalition with
one prime minister as no party is expected to be able to win two
thirds of the 120 seats in the parliament.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Exempts Agricultural Products From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said
Wednesday he had signed legislation exempting agricultural
products from sanctions imposed on India and Pakistan to protect
U.S. farmers' interests.
</P>
<P>
The action, which came after the House and Senate rushed the
bill through Tuesday, cleared the way for the United States to
restore U.S. export credits for agricultural sales to India and
Pakistan, giving U.S. farmers a chance to sell 350,000 tons of
wheat to Pakistan -- the third-ranking buyer of American wheat.
</P>
<P>
"We need to make sure that our sanctions policy furthers our
foreign policy goals without imposing undue burdens on our
farmers," Clinton said in a statement. "This action allows us to
send a strong message abroad without ignoring the real needs of
those here at home."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he signed the bill into law so that "U.S. wheat
and other farm products will not be the unintended victims of an
important nonproliferation law. When implementing sanctions, we
must never forget their humanitarian impact."
</P>
<P>
The United States imposed sanctions in accordance with its
nonproliferation law on India and Pakistan after both countries
conducted nuclear tests last month.

<HEADLINE> S. African-EU Trade Talks Near Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Trade talks between South
Africa and the European Union (EU) were nearing a point where the
two sides have to agree to disagree on some issues, South African
Press Association (SAPA) quoted negotiators as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Head of the South African delegation, Elias Links, told
reporters after the 20th round of talks in Pretoria: "We will not
be able to cover everyone's ambition, and will have to have the
right to withhold the liberalizing of trade in certain areas."
</P>
<P>
Chief EU negotiator Philip Lowe echoed this view, saying both
sides wanted the other to improve its offer in several respects.
</P>
<P>
"In the end we are going to have to... agree on the areas
where we can go further and reach an agreement which represents a
balanced package."
</P>
<P>
Lowe said the talks were entering a decisive stage.
</P>
<P>
"We are in a phase that is firmly ongoing, but also firmly
hard-pounding," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lowe said both parties were committed to concluding a trade
treaty by September which would promote the commercial interests
of both regions while supporting South Africa's development
efforts.
</P>
<P>
The two parties had not yet agreed on the final list of points
which would form part of the compromise in September, Lowe said.
</P>
<P>
Proposals discussed in the latest round related to the areas
such as textiles, clothing, footwear, cars and steel, according
to SAPA.
</P>
<P>
Further talks would focus on fields that would contribute
significantly to South Africa's development potential, while
respecting areas vital to the EU.
</P>
<P>
"We also have sectors which are sensitive from an employment
point of view," Lowe said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to agriculture, he said the South African side
stressed the potential of EU tariff concessions to contribute to
the expansion of South African exports.
</P>
<P>
"We said we would look at the problem sector by sector,
whether in the area of dairy products, vegetables, processed
fruit or wine," Lowe said.
</P>
<P>
Links said EU negotiators made what he labeled ambitious
requests in the previous round of talks with regard to areas such
as cars, textiles, clothing and ceramics.
</P>
<P>
In this week's talks, South Africa clearly outlined the limits
it faced in opening its markets for these products.
</P>
<P>
"We have restated our sensitivities. So, it would be very
difficult to sign off on these areas in one session," Links said.
</P>
<P>
It would be difficult for South Africa to improve its offer
without flexibility from the EU, especially in the agricultural
and industrial sectors, Links said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Leader Orders Release of Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar Wednesday ordered the immediate release of
prisoners in the country, the state television station reported
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Among the prisoners are 362 convicts of the miscellaneous
offenses tribunals who have completed their jail terms.
</P>
<P>
The directive, which was contained in a statement signed by
the chief press secretary to the head of state, also ordered the
release of prisoners who have overstayed their terms in jail.
</P>
<P>
The order was made in line with the determination of the
present administration to decongest prisons and protect freedom
and basic rights of individuals, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement did not say whether or not the prisoners to be
released include political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
General Abubakar has earlier promised to free all the
political prisoners and detainees after ordering the release of
about 30 of them.
</P>
<P>
The head of state, who assumed office on June 9 after the
sudden death of his predecessor General Sani Abacha, also ordered
Wednesday afternoon the dissolution of three of the six
transition institutions.
</P>
<P>
The Transition Implementation Committee, the National
Reconciliation Committee and the Committee of the Devolution of
Power were given a key role by late General Abacha in his
political transition program scheduled to end October 1 this
year.
</P>
<P>
The National Electoral Commission of Nigeria, another most
important one of the six transition agencies, remains untouched,
according to a government statement.
</P>
<P>
The announcement followed the order to disband Abacha's
cabinet made by Abubakar a week ago.
</P>
<P>
As it has entered a crucial time for the military's transition
to civil rule program, Abubakar is expected to announce his own
timetable for the way Nigeria move forward in the next step.

<P>
HONG KONG, July 16 (Xinhua) -- "It is so fast that i can get
my baggage without waiting," said Charlie Weston, an university
student, told Xinhua when he arrived at the new Hong Kong
International Airport from London Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Weston from Oxford University and his two classmates Doug
Corkemil and Sarah Bolton, who have come here for a seven-day
sightseeing, praised the new Hong Kong Airport for its highly
efficient service.
</P>
<P>
"It is fantastic", said Corkemil with a smile.
</P>
<P>
This is the 10th day operation of the Chek Lap Kok airport
since it was commenced on July 6. Passenger Terminal operations
are now being running orderly and smoothly instead of chaos in
the first several days after opening.
</P>
<P>
Indicator boards can clearly tell the time for flights arrivals
and departures while shops and banks at the airport are running
orderly.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Lau, who is going to leave Hong Kong for San Francisco,
told Xinhua: "Compared with Kai Tak Airport, I feel it is more
convenient for passengers to go through procedures for boarding."
</P>
<P>
The latest figures released by the Airport Authority show that
as at 2 P.M., Thursday, there had been 29,000 arrivals and
departures.
</P>
<P>
Most flights left within 15 minutes as scheduled, and the
average passenger waiting time for baggage was 16 minutes. Most
inbound flights arrive here on schedule.
</P>
<P>
"These have all surpassed that of the Kai Tak Airport and met
the international standard," said Ng Ki Sing, general manager of
the Terminal Operations of the Airport Authority.
</P>
<P>
"The overall smoothness of passenger terminal operations has
been the pattern for the past week, showing the situation is
normal," Airport Authority Corporate Development Director Clinton
Leeks added.
</P>
<P>
Ng said: "Over the past week, we have adopted immediate
measures to solve various problems mainly caused by the
non-coordination between different companies in the first several
days' operation of the airport."
</P>
<P>
He said: "Now we have fixed the breakdown of computers and
increased indicator boards."
</P>
<P>
Besides, "We have also mobilized more than 100 staff members
for provisional services at the airport," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Everything at the airport are in good order," he said,
adding: "We will continue to do whatever we can to improve
our service."

<HEADLINE> Appeals Court Blocks Testimony by Clinton's Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Thursday temporarily blocked the head of
President Bill Clinton's Secret Service security detail from
testifying before the grand jury in the Monica Lewinsky
investigation.
</P>
<P>
The appeals court said its emergency stay would remain in
effect until it decides whether to accept the Clinton
administration's appeal of two court decisions ordering Secret
Service agents to testify before Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr's grand jury.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department made a last-minute legal onslaught, and
even prepared to go to the Supreme Court, to stop Special Agent
Larry Cockell from testifying.
</P>
<P>
Cockell, who heads the president's protective detail, arrived
at the courthouse earlier Thursday morning in case he was forced
to testify. He left the court after the appeals court decision.
</P>
<P>
A three-judge panel recently rejected the White House's request
to grant a new privilege for the Secret Service officers and
prevent its personnel from testifying. A judge also had ordered
the testimony.
</P>
<P>
The administration had appealed to the full U.S. Court of
Appeals to rehear the case.
</P>
<P>
That same three-judge panel of Judges Stephen Williams, Douglas
Ginsburg and A. Raymond Randolph issued today's ruling.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson
refused to block the testimony by Cockell and eight uniformed
Secret Service officers who had been subpoenaed by Starr. That
prompted the appeal.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department also sent protective paperwork to the
Supreme Court in case it lost the appeal, The Associated Press
quoted legal sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the subpoenas to the Secret Service, Starr "appears
to be tracking private counsel's meetings and conversations with
the president in an effort to intrude on that relationship,"
Clinton lawyers Robert Bennett and David Kendall said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"Any backdoor attempt by this prosecutor to invade the
president's right to consult with personal counsel will be
aggressively and firmly resisted," they added.

<HEADLINE> France Denies Having Proposed New Arms Sales to Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- France Thursday denied having
proposed to sell missiles to and to build warships for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwanese daily United Daily News reported this week that
France had made these proposals and had sold more than 1,000 Apila
 anti-tank rockets to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"The information reported by the Taiwanese daily does not
correspond to the reality," said French Foreign Ministry spokesman
 Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Daily News, French arms industry
officials made the proposals on building F17 torpedos and SANRAL
surface-to-air missiles at a meeting with Taiwanese military
officials in Taibei two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the meeting in Taibei only "had the
technical character ... on the execution of the contracts signed
in January 1994."
</P>
<P>
"Our position on the question of armament of Taiwan is well
known. It results from the Franco-Chinese joint communique of
January 12, 1994 to which France subscribed and respects
strictly," he said.
</P>
<P>
The arms sales by the former French government under President
Francois Mitterrand had greatly harmed France's relations with
China.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Eritrea Seek to Strengthen Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Eritrea Thursday
pledged to strengthen their bilateral relations in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's Supreme Head of State Tuanku Ja'afar said at a state
banquet in honor of visiting Eritrean President Isayas Afreworki
Thursday night that Malaysia is optimistic that it can work
closely with Eritrea to strengthen their political, trade and
economic relations.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian King said Malaysia is willing to share its
experience on economic and social development with other
developing countries and exchange information and technology.
</P>
<P>
"We have much to gain by cooperating with one another, for in
doing so we prosper each other," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tuanku Ja'afar said he is confident that the state visit by the
Eritrean president will foster greater understanding between the
two countries, improve existing collaborations as well as enable
both governments to explore new avenues for cooperation with a
view to "augmenting the overall bilateral relations."
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Afreworki said Eritrea would sign an agreement
of bilateral cooperation with Malaysia to pave the way for future
closer ties of trade and investment between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean president hoped that his visit would set pace for
Malaysian businessmen to be more aggressive in seeking
opportunities in Africa and invest in various sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said Eritrea has been directing public investment towards
rehabilitating and expanding physical infrastructure while
developing a liberal and conducive climate for private sector
investment.
</P>
<P>
Afreworki arrived here earlier Thursday for a two-day visit to
Malaysia, the first by an Eritrean president since the East
African country gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea has an area of 125,000 square kilometers and a
population of 3.5 million comprising Christians and Muslims.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Steps Up Efforts to Ease Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has
approved a program to generate more jobs and ensure employment for
capable working people through the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam now has about 8.5 million jobless people, mainly in
rural areas, said a Vietnam News Agency (VNA) report on Thursday
quoting latest Ministry of Labor statistics.
</P>
<P>
What makes their job prospects worse, and turns joblessness
into an urgent problem, is that some 1.3 million young Vietnamese
are approaching the working age bracket each year.
</P>
<P>
Some 110 employment centers are now operational in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Under the new government program, measures will be taken to
help unemployed and underemployed people, especially those in the
"under-privileged group" in the labor market, quickly find jobs.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the program aims to create extra 1.3-1.4 million
jobs each year, lower urban jobless rate to 5 percent and raise
rural laborers' working schedule to some 275 days a year by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The government will finance an equivalent of 370 million U.S.
dollars for the program through 2000, and extra funding will be
mobilized from foreign aid and other sources.

<HEADLINE> Regional Crisis Dampens Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Shrinking income and massive
depreciation of currencies in Southeast Asia are expected to
reduce the regional demand for imports while helping strengthen
export competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Imports of commodities whose demand is income- and
price-sensitive would drop considerably, the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FA0) said in a review available here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The review dealt with possible consequences of the financial
turmoil in Asia on the global agricultural commodity market.
</P>
<P>
The FAO does not expect the impact to be marked on the global
level for the majority of agricultural commodities. But the review
said that among commodities imported by the crisis-affected
countries, the impact is expected to be the greatest for maize,
bovine meat, soybean meal, temperate fruit, cotton, hides and
skins, while tropical fruit and rubber are the export commodities
to be most affected.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the impact is expected to be felt mainly through the
reduced import demand, the review said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, weather-related production shortfalls in some cases
and the severe squeeze on working capital are likely to reduce to
some extent the ability of the countries affected to take full
advantage of their increased export competitiveness, according to
the review.
</P>
<P>
It noted that in Thailand, the government recently announced a
policy to encourage production of the agriculture and livestock
sectors in an attempt to increase exports. Furthermore, private
sectors related to food industries have once reviewed a plan to
become the world's food center for both fresh and finished
products.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government and exporters together have laid down an
action plan to develop the entire export industry by upgrading
production technologies. The plan is expected to be implemented
this year, according to the review.

<HEADLINE> UK Govt Welcomes IRA "Signals" over Decommissioning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Britain government welcomed on
Thursday what it described as "signals" that the Irish Republican
Army may be about to decommission its weapons.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said the IRA accepted that
decommissioning was an indispensable part of the Northern Ireland
peace agreement reached last April.
</P>
<P>
But he denied newspaper reports which said arrangements for a
hand-over had already been made.
</P>
<P>
"There have been signals that we welcome. There are signals
that they are aware of the importance of decommissioning," he
said.
</P>
<P>
But he said how the process would happen was not yet clear. "It
is wrong to say venues have been identified," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Express newspaper said on Thursday there was a growing
belief that the IRA would hand over a quantity of guns and bombs
before the Northern Ireland assembly meets in September to begin
selecting the 10-man executive.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, aimed at ending the 30-year conflict in Northern
Ireland, stated that guerrilla groups should give up their weapons
in exchange for the release of prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Tony Blair was due later Thursday to
meet senior officers of the Royal Ulster Constabulary police at
his official London Downing Street residence to discuss the crisis
sparked off by the Protestant annual parade in Portadown since
July 5.

<HEADLINE> Preparatory Work for SAARC Summit Completed: SAARC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The preparatory work for the
10th summit of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) has been completed and the programs follow the
traditions of past summits, SAARC Secretary-General Naeem U. Hasan
said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hasan told a press conference at the Kathmandu-based SAARC
Secretariat that the secretariat team is leaving in a few days for
Colombo, Sri Lanka, to help the host nation in organizing the
summit to be held late this month and the meetings preceding it.
</P>
<P>
"We have confirmation from all the countries that their
respective leaders will go to Colombo," he said.
</P>
<P>
SAARC, formed in December 1985, groups Bangladesh, Bhutan,
India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Hasan said that the official programs of the three-day summit
beginning on July 29 are based on traditions of past summits,
which include speeches and statements by all the leaders,
discussions on issues of common interest and adoption of the
declaration.
</P>
<P>
Besides the official programs, there is a time-honored
tradition that the leaders have their own bilateral meetings on
the sidelines of the summit, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The 10th SAARC summit is to be held in a changed situation in
the region where India and Pakistan conducted nuclear tests in
May.
</P>
<P>
"As far as the summit agenda is concerned, we have two or three
subjects which have traditionally figured in all the summits," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The subjects are poverty eradication and social problems
particularly those regarding women and children, he said.
</P>
<P>
And economic and trade issues, which have figured very
prominently in the last two or three years, are naturally going to
be very high on the agenda of the forthcoming summit, he added.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure they would like to see what are the exact steps
required for the smooth transition from SAPTA (SAARC Preferential
Trading Arrangement) to SAFTA (South Asian Free Trade Area), and
hopefully by the targeted date agreed upon last year at the
summit," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the ninth summit held in May 1997 in Male, the Maldives,
SAARC leaders decided to achieve the SAFTA preferably by the year
of 2001.
</P>
<P>
At the coming summit, the leaders will spend a lot of time,
among others, on the report submitted by the Group of Eminent
Persons (GEP) commissioned by the ninth summit to undertake a
comprehensive appraisal of SAARC and prepare an action plan for
the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The report contains many recommendations both on institutional
reform and future vision, the secretary-general said.
</P>
<P>
Kanti Kumar Poddar, president of the SAARC Chamber of Commerce
and Industry, told the press here last month that he had learned
from the SAARC Secretariat that the GEP had recommended the
postponement from 2001 to 2008 of the realization of SAFTA.
</P>
<P>
"I'm quite surprised that some people have gone around making
statements about (the report)," Hasan said. "I'm quite surprised
that he said that. He didn't get information from the secretariat,
this I can assure you."
</P>
<P>
He said that the secretariat cannot give anything about the
report till it has been seen by the countries and the leaders.

<HEADLINE> Visitor Arrivals to HK Down 5.4 percent in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Visitor arrivals to Hong Kong in
June this year fell by 5.4 percent compared with the same period
last year, reaching a total of 746,000, according to figures
released Thursday by the Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA).
</P>
<P>
Over the first half of this year, arrivals totaled 4.5 million,
a drop of 21 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In June alone, a sharp increase of 70 percent was recorded in
the Chinese mainland market. This can be attributed primarily to
the low base recorded for June last year when travel restrictions
to Hong Kong from the mainland were introduced during the pre- and
post-handover period.
</P>
<P>
Other markets showing moderate growth included Australia,
Singapore and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Northeast Asia continued to show the effects of the economic
turmoil, with arrivals from Japan down by 16 percent and those
from South Korea by 52 percent.
</P>
<P>
The largest drop in arrivals from individual markets in June
was recorded by Thailand, down by 61 percent, due to a continuing
poor economy and a doubling of the departure tax, and Indonesia,
down by 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
The HKTA expects that arrivals for the entire year of 1998 will
be down by about 6 percent and total less than 10 million.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Current Account Surplus Up 62 Percent in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current account surplus in
May was up 62.2 percent from a year earlier to stand at 1,409.1
billion yen (about 10.4 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The increase, for the 14th straight month, was the result of a
sharp decline in imports due to the stagnant domestic demand, the
Finance Ministry said Thursday in a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
Imports dropped 18.1 percent from a year earlier to 2,499.9
billion yen (18.5 billion dollars) in May while exports edged down
1.8 percent to 3,909.8 billion yen (28.9 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The current account measures the flow of goods and services, as
well as investment income and other monetary transfers.
</P>
<P>
In goods and services trade in the fifth month, Japan's surplus
jumped to 935.3 billion yen (6.9 billion dollars), up 144.3
percent from a year earlier, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The surplus in merchandise trade grew 51.9 percent to 1,409.9
billion yen (10.4 billion dollars), up for the 14th straight month.
</P>
<P>
In services trade, Japan had a deficit of 474.7 billion yen
(3.5 billion dollars), down from a year earlier because of a
decline in the number of Japanese tourists going abroad.
</P>
<P>
The income account, consisting of income from investments by
Japanese in foreign securities and payments by foreign employers
to workers in Japan, marked a surplus of 535.9 billion yen (3.9
billion dollars), the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The average exchange rate used for the May report was 135.00
yen to the dollar, compared with 118.99 yen a year earlier.

<P>
OTTAWA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Sulphur-dioxide emissions from U.S
electric utilities rose significantly in 1996, thus worsening
Canadian environmental and health problems caused by acid rain.
</P>
<P>
As reported by the newspaper The Globe and Mail on Thursday,
emissions from the U.S. utility sector rose to 11.4 million tons
in 1996, up from 11 million tons a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
About half the acid rain falling on Eastern Canada comes from
U.S. sources, the biggest of which is the electricity industry.
</P>
<P>
The figures are contained in a U.S. report to be released later
Thursday that ranks the discharges of three major air pollutants
-- sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide -- from the
100 largest electric utilities in the United states.
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared by the New York-based Natural Resources
Defense Council and Public Service Electric and Gas Co. of New
Jersey, indicates that many of the utilities with the highest
emissions of air pollutants are located in the same air shed as
Ontario and other parts of Eastern Canada and the northeastern
United States.

recorded in 1997, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Canada's cost of living was 0.1 percent higher in June than it
was in May. The month-to-month rise was attributed to higher
prices for fresh produce, meat and women's clothing.
</P>
<P>
"Offsetting most of these advances were prices declines for
computers, telephone service, men's and children's clothing," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
On the average, Canadian consumers paid 4.5 percent more for
fresh fruit and 1.7 percent more for fresh vegetables in June than
they did in May.
</P>
<P>
The weakness of the Canadian dollar, coupled with unusual
weather in the southern U.S. earlier this year, has put upward
pressure on the fresh produce prices.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the cost of computers and related gear fell
6.5 percent in June, continuing a trend which has seen prices fall
18.1 percent over the year.
</P>
<P>
"Many large producers of personal computers have passed on
reductions in the cost of components resulting from weak Asian
currencies." the report noted.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's State Budget for 1998-99 Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's state budget for
fiscal year 1998-99 has increased by 88.2 percent from 147.2
trillion rupiah (14.34 billion U.S. dollars) to 277.1 trillion
rupiah (about 27 billion dollars), Financial Minister Bambang
Subianto said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"This change was made to bring the projection closer to a more
realistic budget aim following the economic crisis," he told a
plenary session of the House of Representatives on the amendment
of Law No.3/1998 stipulating the state budget for the present
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
He told the session that the basic assumptions used in
formulating the state budget include the economic growth, the
inflation rate and the rupiah's exchange rate against the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
If in Law No.3/1998 the economic growth is set at zero percent,
in the revised budget, it would be minus 12 percent, while the
inflation rate would increase from 20 percent to 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
It also stipulates that the price of crude oil would decrease
from 17 dollars per barrel to 13 dollars, while the rupiah
exchange rate would be adjusted from 5,000 rupiah to 10,600 rupiah
per dollar.
</P>
<P>
Based on the new assumptions, the minister said, there are also
changes in state revenues, routine expenditures, routine payment
for debt principals and interests.
</P>
<P>
"These changes are in accordance with the assumption on the
change in the exchange rate and the average price of Indonesian
crude oil exports in the international market which tends to
decrease," he added.

<HEADLINE> Somali Militiamen Attack WFP Convoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Six people died and more than
14 others were wounded in Somalia Thursday when opposing
militiamen exchanged heavy fire at the strategic point of K-7
controlled by faction leader Osman Hassan Ali Atto.
</P>
<P>
Reports said all of the deceased and the wounded are combatant
militiamen.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, the shooting began as the
militiamen manning the strong point K-7 tried to intercept and
ambush a large convoy consisting of 28 trucks transporting food
donation to the flood and famine stricken regions in southern
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The eyewitnesses said six battle wagons escorting the convoy
from the World Food Program (WFP) returned fire as the militiamen
manning the junction fired indiscriminately on the food convoy
for what is characterized as a looting attempt.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the shooting, the checkpoint runners managed to
seize two trucks which they had moved to the former university
compound controlled by Osman Ali Atto, while four other trucks
are still trapped in between the opposing militiamen.
</P>
<P>
The sources said four of the deceased are still lying under
the trucks in between the two sides, while five of the wounded
are now being treated in a private hospital in south Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the headquarters of Osman Ali Atto indicated
that the group attacking the WFP food convoy were mutineers who
opposed Osman Ali Atto's administration of the faction.
</P>
<P>
The over 50 heavily armed infantry militiamen were using three
battle wagons. Osman Ali Atto has allegedly tried to stop them
from the attack, however, he failed in the end.
</P>
<P>
The attack on the WFP food convoy, which halted the traffic
movement along the main road to Afgoie Town, has also coincided
with the start of new floods which has already displaced as many
as 400 people in 11 villages in Lower Shabelle region.
</P>
<P>
The attack also came at a time when there is an optimistic
mood in the Somali capital following the return of the faction
leaders from Libya on Saturday.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in major U.S. newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- House Republicans signaled an emerging willingness to
finance the International Monetary Fund fully, indicating a
concern that the economic crises overseas might spread to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton Administration said that it would impose trade
sanctions on nine Russian companies and institutions that have
been helping Iran with its missile program. The action came as
the Russian government for the first time publicly announced an
investigation into these nine enterprises for violating export
control laws.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The World Bank has hired outside auditors to investigate
expenditures from its annual 25 billion dollar fund for
development projects after an internal examination uncovered
"alarming information" about possible kickbacks and embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The farm economy has problems ranging from low prices for
wheat, corn and soybeans to a Southern drought that may stunt
cotton and peanut harvests. Meanwhile, Asia's turmoil is cutting
into demand. Some farmers are retrenching, sending shivers
through the farm-equipment industry and causing concern among
bankers and farm-policy makers.
</P>
<P>
-- Russia's parliament gave its nod to some economic reforms
the government must implement to qualify for billions of dollars
in IMF-led aid. The Communist-led Duma passed several bills aimed
at cutting and simplifying tax levies on small business, and
trimmed the corporate-profit tax to 30 percent from 35 percent.

<HEADLINE> Battle Against Crime to Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Public Security Minister Jia
Chunwang said today that the rising trend in major criminal cases
must be reduced in order to create a stable social environment for
China's reform and development.
</P>
<P>
Jia instructed public security bureaus across the nation to
"concentrate on major problems," and "continue the ongoing battle
against serious crimes."
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that efforts should focus on violent
offenses, including bombings, murder and plunder, as well as
crimes related to guns, drugs and smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Jia said coastal bureaus should pay special attention to crimes
committed by overseas criminal gangs and inland bureaus should
concentrate on resolutely eliminating evil forces.
</P>
<P>
He urged bureaus across the country to increase crime
prevention efforts by increasing patrol activities, improving
security in more communities, towns and villages, confiscating
illegal weapons and explosives and materials, and tightening
controls over the migrant population.
</P>
<P>
China's law enforcement agencies have cracked a large number of
serious criminal cases since April, 1998, with the massive
nationwide campaign of combating crime and protecting the country
and general public from substantial losses.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that some 681,000 criminal cases, including
211,000 major cases, were solved during the first half of the
year.

wholeheartedly serve the people.
</P>
<P>
Wei called on Party members to learn from Jiang Yunsheng, a

Committee in Wafangdian, northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Wei, who also serves as secretary of the CPC Central Commission
for Discipline Inspection, pointed out that Jiang Yunsheng has set
an example for Party officials by steadfastly serving the people

He added that promoting model work styles will be important for
nurturing more qualified Party members and ensuring the smooth
progress of the reform, opening-up and socialist modernization
drive.
</P>
<P>
Wei stressed that following Jiang's example will require Party
members to carry out the principle of serving the people with
heart and soul, and vigorously developing the economy in order
to raise living standards.
</P>
<P>
He also called on Party members to carry forward fine
traditions of the Party, strictly follow Party discipline and
handle matters in an impartial manner.

<HEADLINE> Future World Youth Games to Be Decided: Samaranch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Juan Antonio Samaranch, the
International Olympic Committee President, said here Thursday that
it remains to be decided whether there will be a second World
Youth Games.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch told a press conference in the local Luzhniki Stadium
on the sixth day of the first World Youth Games that international
Olympic officials will review a report on the Moscow games next
December in Lausanne, Switzerland, and decide on the "continuation
or non-continuation" of the games.
</P>
<P>
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov has already declared the games a
success and said the city is now bidding for the right to hold the
2012 Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch declined to issue an express endorsement for the
Moscow bid, but said Moscow has the capacity to stage such an
event.
</P>
<P>
"Moscow is a strong candidate," Samaranch said, adding that
hosting the first World Youth Games is the "best propaganda and
publicity".
</P>
<P>
Arranging the press opportunity for Thursday is apparently
another attempt by Moscow to please Samaranch, who was elected IOC
President exactly 18 years ago in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch, who arrived here Monday to attend the opening
ceremony of the Youth Games, is to leave Moscow later Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Wants SAARC Cooperation to Move in Measured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is definitely committed
to cooperation in South Asia, but wants the cooperation to move in
a "measured and deliberate fashion," Pakistani Ambassador to Nepal
Kamaran Niaz said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Niaz said that his country has
played a positive role in the process of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and is not opposed to
a South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA).
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan has been sort of insisting that it must be measured,
it must be careful and it must venture into areas after thorough
preparation," he said. "Desire to have things done quickly
prevents them (from) being done thoroughly."
</P>
<P>
"What we don't want is that no single state or two states or
whatever should enjoy undue advantages at the expense of other
member states, so the benefits must be as equally distributed as
possible," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said this is not easy given the disparities in size,
potential and economic strength of the SAARC member countries --
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
He said that even in the best of circumstances, it takes a long
time to fully tap the cooperative potential of any region. It
took the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the
European Union a long while to achieve the stage where they are
now, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the case of SAARC, which was formed in December 1985, the
objective becomes even more difficult to be realized mainly
because of four reasons, he said.
</P>
<P>
First of all, bilateral disputes exist between member states
and some of them, like the Kashmir dispute between Pakistan and
India, are far more serious and long-standing.
</P>
<P>
The second is that the economies of the member countries, say
in terms of export, are essentially more competitive rather than
complementary, Niaz said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that Pakistan and India export in agricultural
domain similar items while carpets are exported by Pakistan, India
and Nepal, and tea is an export item for India, Nepal, Bangladesh
and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The third problem is the extreme poverty prevailing in the
region, which alone remains an impediment to cooperation, he said,
citing inadequate infrastructure like communication, roads and
power.
</P>
<P>
But the most serious obstacle is political problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the central step in tapping the full potential
of the SAARC region lies in the "peaceful and just" settlement of
the difficulties, problems and differences existing in the region,
especially those between Pakistan and India, the region's two
powers.
</P>
<P>
"It's only through peaceful, fair and durable settlement of
various issues that we can seriously start diverting attention
toward greater cooperation, put more resources in the economic and
social sectors. That's what SAARC is all about," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that the 10th SAARC summit to be held on July
29-31 in Colombo, Sri Lanka will provide an opportunity for the
prime ministers of Pakistan and India to discuss the issues of
concern, especially the Kashmir problem, and set in motion a set
of meetings or mechanisms to seriously address the problems.
</P>
<P>
"For its part, Pakistan has been willing to discuss every issue
with India in a comprehensive and sincere manner," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that cooperation in agreed areas among
SARRC member countries has proceeded more or less on the expected
lines.
</P>
<P>
"The progress has been steady," he said, but adding that it has
not been spectacular because of the obstacles mentioned above and
the fact that spectacular results are not easy in the agreed
areas.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, these areas were chosen because of hope or
calculation
that these will not lead to any friction," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that progress in areas such as trade, commercial
and economic ties has to be slow because of they are complicated
areas. "Then the backward nature of the economies of the South
Asian countries tends to make the process slower than what will be
in more developed economies," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the forthcoming SAARC summit, Niaz said that Pakistan would
like it to be a success, but the difficulty is that it is held in
a situation where the region is nuclearized after India and
Pakistan's nuclear tests in May.
</P>
<P>
Niaz said that it is up to the leaders to see how best to
continue to promote the objective of SAARC in an altered situation
and convert the sort of crisis situation into a fresh opportunity
for a fresh beginning to revitalize SAARC rather than weaken it.
</P>
<P>
The most urgent tasks for the SAARC region are economic
development, greater allocation of resources to the social sectors
and alleviation of poverty, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Urged to Strengthen Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings
reiterated Wednesday the need to integrate the continent's
economies and strengthen the already existing sub-regional
groupings and revive the spirit of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
However, such efforts require the support of government
through good governance, democracy and wider consultations, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The recognition of the need for a wider consensus in
governance is critical and in the case of Ghana, has been the
bedrock of the political stability and economic progress that we
have made so far," he said.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce
annual congress and business leaders forum in Victoria Falls in
north Zimbabwe, Rawlings urged African businesses to plough back
their earnings into their economies to help develop the
continent, the daily Herald reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said some of the economic problems faced by developing
economies are a result of business leaders' depositing funds
earned from the exploitation of local resources into foreign bank
accounts.
</P>
<P>
Such unpatriotic businesses have caused low growth rates in
most Third World economies, enriching advanced ones which have
doubled their capacities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Africa requires a massive economic renaissance to speed up the
pace of development and improve people's living standards.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the United Nations Economic Commission for
Africa shows that the continent, with about 10 percent of the
world population, accounted for only one percent of the gross
domestic product while half of its population lived in abject
poverty with no access to health, education and other basics.
</P>
<P>
"To achieve a true renaissance, we must reverse the
deteriorating trends by jump-starting our flagging economies,
practising sound macro-economic policies, giving opportunities to
our respective private sectors to become the engine of growth,
and improve the life chances of our peoples through education,
health and social security measures," said the president.

BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The growing exposure of
international automotive manufacturers has helped upgrade the
technology of Chinese auto parts manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
For example, a Ningbo joint venture established by US-based
Eaton Corporation, the world's leading manufacturer of both
engines and hydraulic valve lifters, will source 70 percent of
components from Chinese manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
David Chen, president of Eaton China, said the company was
surprised to find that various local manufacturers have the
technological capability to challenge Eaton, a company widely
recognized for producing the world's best viscous fan drives.
</P>
<P>
One particular manufacturer in Shanghai is one of many local
companies supplying Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive, a Sino-German
joint venture. Shanghai has joined foreign companies in
establishing some 30 joint venture automotive components
ventures which have helped the city's automotive industry
leap forward by raising technological capabilities from 1960s to
1990s level.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government grants tariff reductions to foreign
automotive manufacturers operating in China and sourcing more than
40 percent of components locally.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, an increasing number of international automotive
components manufacturers are establishing joint venture operations
in China to serve global clients. For example, Eaton will use the
Ningbo joint venture to serve major customers such as Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the State Statistics Bureau show that China
has 453 foreign-funded automotive components manufacturers
offering the world's most advanced technological levels. FAW
Volkswagen, a Sino-German joint venture in northeast China's Jilin
Province, has already sold several hundred million sets of engine
parts to Volkswagen in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Heinz Hellmann, general manager of Eaton's Ningbo joint
venture, pointed to the excellent growth prospects for China's
automotive components market. He said Eaton plans to invest 100
million US dollars in China by the year 2000, and will increase
its annual sales in China to 25 million US dollars within five
years.
</P>
<P>
Competition posed by foreign-funded manufacturers has forced
local companies to form large enterprise groups. For example,
Shanghai's automotive industry has gained control of over 66
component manufacturers in 13 provinces. The scale of production
enabled Shanghai Volkswagen to lower retail prices for components
by over 40 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that China has more than 15,000
automotive components manufacturers, including 130 with annual
operating revenues of over 100 million yuan (about 12 million US
dollars) each. Figures also show that 2,700 enterprises have
annual revenues of less than 500,000 yuan (about 60,000 US
dollars) each.

The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) has played a positive role in
promoting mutual trust, dialogue, and cooperation among countries
in this region, Tang said, and is the sole channel for dialogue
and cooperation among governments in the region.
</P>
<P>
China is satisfied with the development of ARF and hopes that
it will develop further in the future, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Post-Ministerial Conference (PMC) that ASEAN began is a
place to promote mutual understanding and cooperation and a
channel for dialogue and cooperation between the south and the
north, Tang said, and China appreciates ASEAN's efforts to have
dialogues and cooperation inside and outside the region. China has
been active in each PMC meeting since it joined ASEAN, he pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that all participants will discuss increasing
cooperation between developed and developing countries to help
Asian countries overcome their current difficulties, and hopes to
listen to ASEAN's plans and proposals and to discuss coordination
and cooperation of problems between nations with all participants,

<HEADLINE> Festina Team Director Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, France, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Festina team director Bruno
Roussel, currently detained for questioning in a doping case
probe, has been suspended by the International Cycling Union (UCI)
pending the investigation.
</P>
<P>
The UCI announced the decision on Thursday at the start of the
fifth stage of the Tour de France in the Cholet.
</P>
<P>
Roussel and two others were held for questioning by police on
Wednesday following the arrest last week of a Festina masseur
Willy Voet who was carrying hundreds of doping products in a team
car. Voet is currently jailed in Lille.
</P>
<P>
Tour director Jean-Marie Leblanc said Roussel's suspension was
provisional and that it would not affect the riders. Assistant
team director Miguel Moreno will look after the team while Roussel
is detained.
</P>
<P>
Roussel was held along with the team doctor Eric Rijckaert and
another team member in Cholet at the end of the fourth stage of
the Tour on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Festina, who have denied involvement, said Roussel wanted to
be heard as quickly as possible by the police to set the record
straight.

OTTAWA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced Thursday it will
provide additional 5 million Canadian dollars (3.4 million U.S.
dollars) in food aid to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK).

Observer missions in the DPRK, sponsored by the WFP and the
Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), have concluded the food
crisis in the country is far from over due to weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
With the announcement on Thursday, Canadian aid to the DPRK
since 1995 will total over 20 million Canadian dollars (13.6

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Taxi Drivers End Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan taxi drivers and
operators have ended their three-day strike following a promise
by Transport Minister John Nasasira to review the newly-passed
traffic law.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the taxis in the capital city Kampala have resumed
their normal operations Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The motocycles, which were very busy ferrying people to and
from work during the strike of the taxi drivers, are now seen
staying along the roadside or waiting idly for passengers at bus
stops.
</P>
<P>
According to a New Vision report Thursday, the transport
minister will review the new traffic law in consultation with
the drivers.
</P>
<P>
Nasasira was quoted as saying that the law is not yet in force
and the drivers are supposed to put their grievances in a
memorandum.
</P>
<P>
"Our problem is the new law. The minister has suspended its
implementation which enabels us to work without fear," Godfrey
Ssepuya, a driver at the Gayaza Road stage, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The newly-passed traffic law imposes heavy fines on taxi
drivers who are involved in fatal traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has no government financed public transport systems,
people therefore have to take taxis to and from work. The
three-day strike shut down part of the economy in the capital
city.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Rise for Fourth Straight Day in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices in Tokyo were helped
Thursday by soaring prices in some blue-chip issues and therefore
closed higher for the fourth consecutive trading day.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange gained 117.78 points, or 0.71
percent, from Wednesday's close to end at 16,731.92.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX) covering all First Section
issues rose 5.42 points, or 0.42 percent, to 1,280.73.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the First Section fell to an estimated 430 million
shares from Wednesday's 473.43 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Nippon Steel was Thursday's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei finished the morning slightly lower, but an
afternoon report that former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku
Kajiyama will run in the race for presidency of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) jolted investors into buying more stocks.
</P>
<P>
Kajiyama is seen as one who has the ability to push forward
unpopular reforms.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has resigned over the
LDP's defeat in Sunday's House of Councillors election. A new
prime minister and cabinet are expected to be decided by the end
of the month.
</P>
<P>
Until that political puzzle is solved, traders said investors
are likely to continue buying stable, blue-chip issues because
fears over Japan's bad loan-ridden banking sector have yet to
dissipate.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,332 issues listed on the First Section, gainers
outnumbered losers 621 to 506, with 142 issues remaining
unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Parties Planning New Organization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Talks among four of Nigeria's five
registered parties on the formation of a full-fledged political
organization to play a role in the current democratization
process have reached advanced stage, according to politicians.
</P>
<P>
The four parties have gradually developed into an alliance
known as Group of Four, or G4, since they were defeated by the
United Nigeria Congress Party (UNCP) in the national assembly
election last April.
</P>
<P>
The step was taken in anticipation of the disbandment of the
the registered parties in the country by the government led by
General Abdulsalam Abubakar, who became head of state one day
after the sudden death of his predecessor, the late General Sani
Abacha on June 8.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar had by Wednesday dissolved the country's cabinet and
three out of the six transition agencies established during the
time of Abacha.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the leadership of the four parties
arrived at this decision immediately after the death of Abacha,
particularly against the background of the trenchant calls on
government to scrap parties, said a national facilitator of the
group.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed politician, who is also a national executive of
one of the parties in question, said the G4 would essentially
form the nucleus of a new political organization envisioned by
the leadership of the parties.
</P>
<P>
The four parties had little or no option but to fuse into one
political unit, because the government may have made up its mind
not only to scrap the parties, but also to reduce the number of
the parties to two, he said, quoted by the Daily Times Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, the military administrators in all
the 36 states across Nigeria have submitted to the government
reports on the performance of each of the five parties in their
respective states.
</P>
<P>
The reports, made at the request of Abubakar, are to enable
the government to decide the future of the parties, which the
national facilitator said the group was simply waiting for before
it swings into real action.
</P>
<P>
The G4 had already set up two main committees to ensure a
smooth transformation of the alliance to a registered political
organization, he added.

<HEADLINE> Rubin to Arrive in Kenya Thursday Night </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin will arrive here Thursday night on the last leg of his
five-nation African tour.
</P>
<P>
Rubin's visit has been widely seen as the U.S. seriousness at
opening Africa's market and trying to shift its policy from aid
to trade with Africa, an idea highlighted by U.S. President Bill
Clinton's African tour in March.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Rubin is scheduled to hold talks with
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, visit the Nairobi Stock
Exchange and give a speech at Kenya School of Monetary Studies.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. treasury Secretary is accompanied by a 30-strong
delegation including entrepreneurs, businessmen and World Bank
and International Monetary Fund officials. The trip is said to
be the most extensive trip by a U.S. treasury chief to
sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
Rubin started his African tour last Sunday which has already
brought him to Cote d'Ivoire, South Africa, Nambia and
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana told reporters last
Friday that the Americans are keen on African markets because of
the fact that the continent has abundant resources.
</P>
<P>
"We are the ideal entry point for the American market to
penetrate the COMESA (Common Market of Eastern and Southern
Africa) unity of the markets," said Godana.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the U.S. was the sixth largest market for
Kenya's exports.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that in 1996 Kenyan exports to the U.S.
were worth some 3.017 billion Shillings (about 51 million U.S.
Dollars), while imports reached 8.802 billion Shillings (149.2
million Dollars).

<HEADLINE> Russia Urged to Stop Aiding Iranian Missile Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel renewed its demand
Thursday that Russia immediately stop aiding Iran's missile
development program, citing it poses threat to the stability of
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The demand was put forward by Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai when he met here with Director of Russia's Security
Services Nikolai Kovalev.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said that if Tehran succeeded in developing
non-conventional weapons and long-range missiles, then not only
Israel but also all other countries in the Middle East would be
threatened.
</P>
<P>
He said Israel was interested in building "open and serious
relations" with Russia, but the goal would be more easily achieved
if Moscow stopped aiding Iran with missile technology.
</P>
<P>
Israel has long been regarding Iran as its leading military
threat in the region.
</P>
<P>
Kovalev, heading a delegation of eight security and
intelligence officials, is in Israel on an official visit. He is
the first senior Russian security official to visit Israel.
</P>
<P>
Besides the Iranian missile program, the two officials also
discussed cooperation in fighting organized crimes and
international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Fearing Tehran will produce its own prototype for
ground-to-ground missiles that can hit its territory, Israel has
been exerting tremendous efforts to persuade Moscow to halt the
alleged flow of missile technologies to Iran by some Russian
companies.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Russia announced Wednesday that it
was conducting an investigation against nine scientific institutes
and companies suspected of transferring ballistic missile
technologies to Iran.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came just hours before the U.S. House of
Representatives was scheduled to override a veto by President Bill
Clinton to imposing sanctions on the involved Russian
companies. Both Israel and the White House welcomed the Russian
move.

<HEADLINE> Aussie Banks to Spend 630 Million U.S. Dollars on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Australian banks will spend
almost one billion Australian dollars (630 million U.S. dollars)
to fix the millennium bug and thousands of staff will be assigned
to ensure their organizations are Year 2000 ready, the Reserve
Bank of Australia (RBA) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The RBA, or the nation's central bank, also said that it would
spend a total of 3 million U.S. dollars on the problem, the bulk
of which would be for redeploying existing staff from other
activities.
</P>
<P>
The RBA, as well as the Australian Prudential Regulation
Authority, Thursday released a publication called "Year 2000
Preparations in the Australian Banking and Financial System."
</P>
<P>
Year 2000 problem, nicknamed y2k, also known as Millennium
Bug, has evolved as most computer software use only two digits to
specify a year. This means the year 2000 would appear as 00 and
would be read by a computer as 1900, potentially causing chaos for
computerized systems around the world.
</P>
<P>
As part of the study banks were surveyed in May 1997 and again
in March 1998 to gauge their efforts to address Year 2000
concerns.
</P>
<P>
It found that banks around the country expected to spend almost
630 million U.S. dollars on their Year 2000 projects, up from just
over 360 million U.S. dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 percent of that amount had now been spent compared
with only 10 percent previously.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, banks have over 1600 information technology (IT)
staff, or around 20 percent of their total IT staff, working on
Y2K renovation and testing.
</P>
<P>
The RBA began work on the Year 2000 problem in 1996, all
inventory had now been completed and assessment of all core
processes were undertaken by March this year.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government unveiled a 78 million U.S. dollar
package two months ago to tackle the millennium bug facing
government agencies.

<HEADLINE> Visitor Arrivals to HK Down 5.4 percent in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Visitor arrivals to Hong Kong in
June this year fell by 5.4 percent compared with the same period
last year, reaching a total of 746,000, according to figures
released Thursday by the Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA).
</P>
<P>
Over the first half of this year, arrivals totaled 4.5 million,
a drop of 21 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In June alone, a sharp increase of 70 percent was recorded in
the Chinese mainland market. This can be attributed primarily to
the low base recorded for June last year when travel restrictions
to Hong Kong from the mainland were introduced during the pre- and
post-handover period.
</P>
<P>
Other markets showing moderate growth included Australia,
Singapore and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
North Asia continued to show the effects of the economic
turmoil, with arrivals from Japan down by 16 percent and those
from South Korea by 52 percent.
</P>
<P>
The largest drop in arrivals from individual markets in June
was recorded by Thailand, down by 61 percent, due to a continuing
poor economy and a doubling of the departure tax, and Indonesia,
down by 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
The HKTA expects that arrivals for the entire year of 1998 will
be down by about 6 percent and total less than 10 million.

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Curb Won's Appreciation by Paying Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government may use
part of the country's foreign exchange reserves to pay its
foreign debts as a way to contain the rapid appreciation of the
South Korean currency won against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Park Jie-won, a presidential spokesman, Thursday made the
remarks when the won's recent gains against the U.S. dollar become
a hot topic in the country.
</P>
<P>
The won soared to a seven month high against the greenback
Tuesday, thanks to an over-supply of the U.S. dollar and the South
Korean government's decision not to intervene in the market.
</P>
<P>
The won Thursday continued to strengthen, closing at 1,258
against the dollar. It was the first time in seven months that
the won broke the 1,300 level since the country began suffering a
financial crisis late last year.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's foreign exchange reserves, which now stand at 37
billion U.S. dollars, are expected to reach 50 billion
U.S. dollars in the near future as South Korean companies have
been working hard to bring in foreign capital, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that if the foreign currency reserves exceed
"a certain level," part of them may be used to pay short-term
foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
"We may consider repaying short-term debts earlier than
expected," he said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea signed an agreement with the International Monetary
Fund last December for a rescue loan of 57 billion U.S. dollars
after it was gripped by the financial crisis caused by corporate
bankruptcies and bad loans of financial institutions.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa, long troubled
with high crime rate, has had its serious crimA
'`xN levels
stabilized, according to a statement by the Department of Safety
and Security.
</P>
<P>
The Citizen newspaper Thursday quoted the statement as saying
that based upon a statistic in the first three months this year,
the serious crime levels had stabilized and there was a
"downward" trend in this period.
</P>
<P>
A survey by the Crime Information Management Center of the
South African Police Service (SAPS) shows that rape levels which
had increased during the first three months last year and in
1996, have stabilizeuXUdyear.
</P>
<P>
HogA!@M&AMP;wd robbery without aggravating assault as well as cases
of illegal possession of firearms have increased, the department
said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
"Although the statistics continue to indicate that the crime
situation in South Africa is stabilizing and on downward trend,
levels of crime in the country are still high and much work still
needs to be done to reduce the levels to the acceptable
international standards," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that following a constant flow of
experienced members leaving the SAPS, "the performance of police
in solving crime and their ability to cope with the case docket
load, leave much room for improvement."

<HEADLINE> Power Shift Problem Yet to Be Solved in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The problems that led to the
overthrow of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah of Sierra Leone in May
last year have not been solved, according to a senior officer of
the west African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG).
</P>
<P>
The issues that arose from the power shift from military to
civilian and from the northern elite to their southern
counterparts were yet to be redressed, said Maxwell
Khobe, task force commander of ECOMOG which has been in charge of
the security in Sierra Leone since February.
</P>
<P>
Khobe made the remarks at a forum organized by the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) on conflict management
and resolution, which just closed in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
In a paper titled "Anatomy of Sierra Leonean Conflict and Its
Resolution by ECOWAS", Khobe said that there are still widespread
fears and apprehension about the intention of the Sierra Leonean
People's Party (SLPP).
</P>
<P>
"The origin of the crisis in Sierra Leone lay in part in the
struggle for political power between political parties -- the
SLPP, dominated by elite of southern and southeastern ethnic
groups, and the All Peoples' Congress (APC) led by the educated
elite of northern and northwestern origins," he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to Khobe, the educational imbalance and other
disadvantages arising out of colonial experience between these
two geopolitical areas created prejudices and fears which
politicians in both parties exploited for their own selfish
purposes.
</P>
<P>
The SLPP led the country to independence in 1961 and until
1967 when the APC took over and ruled for 24 years before Maada
Bio conducted elections which gave the control back to SLPP in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Khobe said that the emergence of the ill-trained,
poorly-recruited, inadequately-supervised and disgruntled troops
in the country's armed forces, assembled mainly to prosecute the
civil war, became easy collaborators with political and economic
elite, who had scores to settle with democratic government.
</P>
<P>
There was deep division on what to do with the old army, the
civil defense unit Kamajors and other civil defense militia, he
said, adding that this division permeates the country's political
landscape.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, there is a need to reorganize, retrain and reorient
the armed forces, and another compelling need to restore public
confidence in the military and to restore honor, respect and
prestige to the institution.
</P>
<P>
"Although the resolution of political conflicts in the country
remains the sovereign right of the Sierra Leonean people, the
people and leaders of west Africa must continue to keep watchful
eyes on the events in the country as they require regional and
international support, understanding and concrete assistance to
sail through this difficult era," the commander said.
</P>
<P>
He urged all Sierra Leoneans -- military, politicians,
academicians and the civil society -- to seriously view the
implications of the programs of national reconciliation, which
"must be seen as a total process that excludes no one or
institution."

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Tie Knot Saturday: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 16 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela will finally tie knot with his long-time
sweetheart, Graca Machel, widow of late Mozambican president
Samora Machel, The Star daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Reportedly the wedding is to take place in Mandela's Houghton
home in Johannesburg on Saturday, Mandela's 80th birthday, the
paper quoted sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's spokesman, Parks Mankahlana said Wednesday night
that he knew nothing about the wedding and described reports as a
rumor that had been circulating for a while.
</P>
<P>
But the paper said that the South African Home Affairs
Department has been asked to arrange the formalities around
Machel's status as a citizen of Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Mandela and Machel, 52, went public about their relationship
last year. But the two have always scotched rumors of marriage,
even when Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Mandela's close friend,
publicly but light-heartedly castigated them for setting a bad
example for the youth in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mandela has publicly declared his willingness to tie the knot,
indicating that the reluctance to marry came from Machel's side.
He said in an interview with SABC-Television in February that he
was "blooming like a flower" because of Machel's love.
</P>
<P>
He met Machel in 1990, shortly after his release from prison.
</P>
<P>
Mandela married his first wife Evelyn in 1944 and his second
wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, in 1958. He got divorced from
Winnie in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Trained as a lawyer, Machel is one of the most influential
figures in Mozambique, notably as an international campaigners
for children's rights.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has imported six rhinos
from Namibia to beef up the rhino population which had depleted
over the years due to poaching, according to Zambian Permanent
Secretary of the Tourism Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Times of Zambia newspaper Thursday quoted Permanent
Secretary Xen Vlahakis as saying Wednesday that his country was
forced to import the rhinos to increase stocks in its national
parks.
</P>
<P>
"We have bought six rhinos from Namibia to revive our rhino
population in the parks," said Vlahakis.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are only five other rhinos in the parks
imported from South Africa and the indigenous rhinos have been
wiped out by poachers.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian breed will be distributed to the areas which
complements the natural habitats as they are prone to sleeping
sickness.
</P>
<P>
He called on the public to guard Zambia's wildlife because it
is costing the state huge amounts of money to replenish the
parks.
</P>
<P>
Vlahakis said that tourism, earmarked to be the country's
major foreign exchange earner, need massive investment to boost
itself.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Japan's Political Orientation Attracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Japan produced a piece of breaking
news recently when Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto stepped down
to take responsibility for his ruling Liberal Democratic Party's
severe loss in the Upper House elections.
</P>
<P>
Then, who will become the next steersman in Japan? It is not
only the topic of the day for the Japanese people but also a
question of concern of the international community.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Japan was stuck in the economic mire which
resulted in a full-scale recession in fiscal 1997 when a negative
growth of 0.7 percent occurred, triggering off a sharp devaluation
of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
These economic hardships produced a direct impact on Japan's
politics. In fact, the House of Councillors or the Upper House
poll Sunday reflected the voters' dissatisfaction with the present
economic situation as well as their concern over the future.
</P>
<P>
Japan, the second biggest economic power in the world, is a
country with important influence in Asia and the world. Whether
Japan can maintain economic and political stability will not only
affect its own interests, but also exert influence upon the
situation in Asia and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
In circumstances where east Asian countries are still severely
disturbed by the financial crisis, the international community,
Japan's neighbors in particular, are expecting Japan to take
effective measures to overcome its own difficulties and carry out
its commitments to helping other Asian countries in trouble and
promoting regional economic development.
</P>
<P>
What path Japan will take in the future deserves careful
consideration by Japanese politicians as well as the Japanese
people. It is also an issue of world interest.
</P>
<P>
Although the policies to be taken by the new government is not
known at present, it is hoped that Japan will maintain its
political stability and revive its economy at an early date. It is
also hoped that Japan's new leader and his administration will
follow the trend of the times, have a peace-loving and steady
image, and make more contributions to peace and development in the
region as well as the world.

<HEADLINE> HK-Mainland Expert Group on Sewage Disposal Holds First Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong-Mainland Expert
Group on Sewage Disposal agreed here Thursday to set up a
technical group to discuss the likely environmental impact of
various outfall and treatment options for stage II of the
Strategic Sewage Disposal Scheme (SSDS).
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at the first meeting of the group
held on Thursday, which was co-chaired by Bowen Leung, secretary
for Planning, Environment and Lands, and Zhang Liangdong, director
of the Hong Kong Economic Affairs Department of the Hong Kong and
Macao Affairs Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
A report viewing these options for Stage II is due to be
presented to the government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR). The Technical Group will then convene
its first meeting around mid August 1998.
</P>
<P>
Both sides reaffirmed the importance of efforts by the Mainland
and Hong Kong to protect coastal water quality, so as to maintain
a healthy living environment and guard against environmental and
economic damage.
</P>
<P>
The expert group reconfirmed the commitment of both sides to
work together to this end.
</P>
<P>
The group agreed to continue its discussions after the
technical group had considered the review of Stage II options for
the SSDS.
</P>
<P>
Stage I of Hong Kong's SSDS includes the construction of a
chemically enhanced primary treatment facility at Stonecutters
Island, and the building of deep underground tunnels to divert
outfalls from Tseung Kwan O, Kowloon, Tsuen Wan, Kwai Chung and
Hong Kong Island East to the new treatment plant.
</P>
<P>
Stage II of the SSDS involves the construction of a deep
oceanic outfall to take treated sewage out of the inner harbor
areas.
</P>
<P>
A review of the options and environmental impact assessment for
locating the outfall, and for the level of final treatment
required, is due to be completed later this month. Further works
to construct collection tunnels to link the remaining areas of
Hong Kong Island to the system are being planned.

<HEADLINE> HK TV Series Draws Awareness of Communicable Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A TV documentary series was
introduced Wednesday by the Hong Kong government to promote public
awareness of communicable diseases.
</P>
<P>
The series of 10 half-hour programs focuses on subjects
including cholera and bacillary dysentery, immunization program
for children, influenza, food-borne diseases, social hygiene
diseases, tuberculosis, travelers' health, blood-borne diseases
and enteroviruses.
</P>
<P>
Jointly produced by Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK), the
Department of Health (DH) and Hong Kong Medical Association
(HKMA), the series also forms an integral part of the Hong Kong
government's Healthy Living into the 21st Century campaign
launched earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held Wednesday to introduce the
TV series, DH's Consultant on Community Medicine, Dr. Mak
Kwok-hang, expressed concern over the increase in some
communicable diseases including food-borne diseases in Hong Kong
in the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to DH statistics, there were 53 cholera cases and 314
food poisoning outbreaks involving 1,209 persons in the first half
of 1998, compared with 13 cholera cases and 148 food poisoning
outbreaks involving 818 persons in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The upsurge in the number of cholera cases was mainly due to a
large number of imported cases in March who contracted the
infection while traveling abroad. The increase in the number of
food poisoning cases was related to the consumption of large coral
reef fish, according to Dr. Mak.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Mak noted, while the government has been stepping up health
education and increased the inspection of food premises, it is
important for the public to support these actions by maintaining a
healthy living lifestyle.

make a statement on the postal strike, which began throughout the
country eight days ago.
</P>
<P>
The striking postal workers demanded higher wages and more
benefits of postal employees, and accused the communication
minister of getting the nation into great difficulty by making the
dispute a prestige issue.
</P>
<P>
Congress leader in the House Manmohan Singh said that the whole
House was agitated about the prolonged strike by postal employees
and the country has been put to immense inconvenience. It is of
utmost importance that an amicable solution is found without
further loss of time, he said.
</P>
<P>
While the communication minister tried to clarify the
government position on the strike, the determined opposition
wanted the prime minister to clarify. Rejecting the opposition
demand, leader of the House Sikandar Bakht said that "You cannot
dictate the House" and disallow the minister to place facts. This
sparked off heated exchanges between the ruling and opposition MPs
and the chairman's appeal for order went unheeded.
</P>
<P>
Later, sharing the concern of the opposition MPs, Vajpayee
appealed to postal employees to end their strike immediately to
pave the way for an amicable solution through negotiations.

<P>
NEW DELHI, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Indian Defense Minister George
Fernandes said Thursday that India has started production of the
pilotless target aircraft (PTA) "Lakshya" and two such aircraft
are scheduled to be delivered to the air force by next month.
</P>
<P>
In a written reply to a question in the Lower House of
Parliament here, Fernandes said that the Defense Research
Development Organization (DRDO) has undertaken limited series of
production of PTA to meet the urgent need of the air force, navy
and army.
</P>
<P>
The technology is also being transferred to some companies such
as the Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. and the Bulk Production Agency
to meet further requirements of the three services, he said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to India's frigates projects, Fernandes said that
projects for indigenous production of frigates by Mazgaon Dock
Ltd. and Garden Reach Ship Builders and Engineers Ltd. have been
delayed due to manifold increases in their costs.

<HEADLINE> China to Expand Health Care Project to All Rural Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to expand an
experimental rural health care project in 14 counties to all rural
areas because the project with the collaboration of the World
Health Organization (WHO) has been a great success, said a WHO
expert here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The project, having involved 8.7 million Chinese farmers, has
been run in 14 counties in seven provinces for the past four years.
</P>
<P>
"Since it was judged successful, the government of China has
decided to promote it for the country's 900 million peasants,"
said Guy Carrin, a health economist with WHO's Division of
Intensified Cooperation with Countries and Peoples in Greatest
Need (ICO).
</P>
<P>
China has a total population of around 1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, China experienced a boom in rural cooperative
medical services, and by the end of the decade more than 90
percent of the country's villages had set up such health care
systems.
</P>
<P>
The experiences learned in the 14 pilot counties between 1994
and 1997 enabled the Chinese Ministry of Public Health to
formulate a series of regulations and a national program to
promote a rural health insurance system.
</P>
<P>
These have now been officially listed in China's long-term
development targets to the year 2010. At present between 10
percent and 15 percent of the rural population is covered. The
goal for 2010 is 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has planned to create a medical
insurance system in most villages, according to Dr. Zhang
Zhaoyang, division chief in charge of primary health care
promotion at the Chinese Ministry of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
Carrin said that the joint Chinese-WHO initiative to promote
the health of almost one billion women, men and children is surely
a cause to rejoice.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Hopes IMF Assistance Strengthens Rupiah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior Indonesian minister
Thursday expressed the hope that the release of 1 billion U.S.
dollars in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) assistance would
help restore international confidence in the country's economy and
eventually strengthen the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
"The disbursement of the IMF fund would increase the certainty
of support for the balance of payment," Coordinating Minister for
Economy, Finance and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF board of directors on Wednesday approved the release of
1 billion dollars as part of its 43-billion-dollar rescue package
for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Of the package, 10 billion U.S. dollars was pledged by the IMF
and the rest by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB)
and friendly countries.
</P>
<P>
The IMF released the first tranche of the aid worth 3 billion
dollars in November 1997, but the second disbursement was delayed
due to riots in Jakarta in May and the following political crisis
in the country which forced former president Soeharto to step
down.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to arrest the country's economic crisis, the
Indonesian government has signed a revised bailout agreement with
the IMF on June 24, which paved the way for the resumption of the
43-billion-dollar IMF-led rescue package.
</P>
<P>
After meeting President B. J. Habibie here Thursday, Ginandjar
told reporters that the country needs 10-11 billion dollars this
year.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the 1 billion dollars from the IMF, he said,
Indonesia will receive 550 million dollars from the ADB and 600
million dollars from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia also obtained direct and indirect help through
bilateral and multilateral assistance from other countries, such
as the postponement in the repayment of debt principals.
</P>
<P>
"Rescheduling (debts) is not a shameful thing because other
countries like Mexico have done the same," he said.

<HEADLINE> 700 People Killed in China's Summer Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Civil Affairs
today reported 760 people killed by the summer flooding .
</P>
<P>
The provinces of Fujian, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang in
eastern China, Hubei and Hunan in central China, Guangdong and the
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in southern China, and Sichuan in
the Southwest were all hit by severe flooding.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary statistics showed more than 70 million people in
these areas were affected by floods that have destroyed more than
1.4 million houses and 4.7 million hectares of crops, causing
losses of over 47 billion yuan (nearly 6 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Civil Affairs Ministry's Disaster Relief Department says
that the flooding started quite early and affected many parts of
the country.
</P>
<P>
In early March, this included Jiangxi, Fujian, Hubei, Hunan,
and Guangdong provinces and the municipality of Chongqing, and in the
Northwest, including Gansu and Qinghai provinces and Ningxia and
Xinjiang regions in late May.
</P>
<P>
Since mid June, most regions south of the Yangtze River have
seen unusually heavy rainfall that made the situation worse in
already-flooded areas and led to new serious flooding in Anhui,
Guangxi, Sichuan and Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Civil Affairs has sent officials to
flood-stricken areas to direct disaster relief, allocated
nearly 100 million yuan for relief funds and provided several
thousand tents for people who are homeless.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Flights Grounded by Pilots Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Most flights of Lebanese national
carrier, the Middle East Airlines (MEA), were grounded Thursday as
its 160 pilots started a 24-hour strike since midnight Wednesday
in demand for better pay and benefits.
</P>
<P>
The strike has paralyzed 22 flights of the MEA to and from the
Beirut International Airport, the Orient radio reported here.
But the 15 flights of foreign airlines will not be affected.
</P>
<P>
The pilots decided to launch the strike after the company
management failed to meet their demands for salary hikes, better
indemnities and medical insurance, which were raised in March in
their first confrontation within the year.
</P>
<P>
The pilots planned a six-hour strike but cancelled it later in
March at the request of the MEA administration after it promised
to examine their demands.
</P>
<P>
After the passage of three months, the pilots finally lost
their patience and went ahead the strike to protest the inaction
of the company management.
</P>
<P>
Calling it an illegal act, the MEA Chairman Mohammed Hout said
he was taken aback by the strike which would aggravate the already
grave MEA financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the company maintained its rights in taking
the stand that served its interest best. But he didn't say what
measures the company would take against the striking pilots.
</P>
<P>
The pilots are scheduled to hold a news conference at the MEA
headquarters Thursday afternoon to elaborate their demands.
</P>
<P>
The MEA, 99 percent of which is owned by the country's central
bank, has been beset with financial and managerial problems in
recent years, with its 1997 losses standing at 53 million
U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Rawlings Urges Economic Coop in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings
has reiterated the need to integrate the continent's economies
and strengthen the already existing sub-regional groupings to
revive the spirit of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
However, such efforts require the support of governments
through good governance, democracy and wider consultations, the
Ghanaian president said Wednesday when officially opening the
Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce annual congress and
business leader forum in Victoria Falls of north Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"The recognition of the need for a wider consensus in
governance is critical and, in the case of Ghana, has been the
bedrock of the political stability and economic progress that we
have made so far," said Rawlings.
</P>
<P>
He urged the African businesses to plow back their earnings
into their economies to help develop the continent, the daily
Herald reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings was quoted as saying that some of the economic
problems faced by developing economies are a result of business
leaders depositing funds earned from the exploitation of local
resources into foreign bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
He said that Africa requires a massive economic renaissance to
prop up the pace of development and improve the living standards
of people.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) shows
that Africa, with about 10 percent of the world's population,
accounted for only one percent of the gross domestic product
while half of its population are living in abject poverty with no
access to health, education and other basics.
</P>
<P>
"To achieve a true renaissance, we must reverse the
deteriorating trends by jump-starting our flagging economies,
practising sound macro-economic policies, giving opportunities to
private sectors to become the engine of growth, and improve the
life changes of our peoples through educations, health and social
security measures," said the Ghanaian president.

PARIS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Thursday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad Thursday will begin his
state visit to France to seek French support in the great
diplomatic gamble in the Middle East. Assad is afraid that Syria
will be isolated by the United States in Washington's diplomatic
efforts to persuade Israel to resume the peace process. Syria is
also faced with troubles in relations with Lebanon where it
maintains 30,000 troops, as Israel has repeatedly indicated that
it will withdraw from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
-- Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek, who is on a visit
to France, Wednesday called on the European Union not to stop its
enlargement process toward central and eastern Europe. He also
regretted the lack of the will among some European leaders to
integrate central and eastern European countries.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- During Syrian President Hafez al-Assad's visit to Paris
which is expected to be start on Thursday, French President
Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin will present to
him a French position on the Middle East peace process and the
development of bilateral relations in economic, scientific and
cultural fields.
</P>
<P>
-- The Paris Bourse Thursday inscribed its 47th record high
with 4,344.96 points, 2.07 percent higher than the previous
day. The CAC 40 index has increased by 44.8 percent since the
beginning of the year, as compared with 43.7 percent in Frankfurt,
20 percent in London and 16.2 percent in New York.

<HEADLINE> 1,000 Passengers Stranded in Lake Victoria Ports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Suspension of ferry
services between two Tanzanian towns along the Lake Victoria have
forced over 1,000 passengers to cancel their journeys or
wait in anxiety.
</P>
<P>
The transport services from Mwanza to Bukoba ports were
suspended Wednesday after the engines of the only remaining ship
MV (motor vessel) Serengeti had mechanical problems, The Guardian
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Two other two vessels, MV Victoria and MV Clarias, are still
under repair.
</P>
<P>
"I have 100 bunches of banana worth one million Shillings
(about 1,504 U.S. Dollars). Without ship transport, I'm sure to
incur a loss," the paper quoted a businessman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Passengers, especially businessmen from Karagwe, Kyaka and
neighboring Uganda, who opted to take buses have to suffer the
hike of fare from 7,000 to 13,000 Shillings, and risk
encountering bandits on the Bukoba-Mwanza road.
</P>
<P>
A few have chosen Precision Air but it cannot accommodate all
passengers.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Tanzania Railways Corporation, which is in
charge of the ferry services between the two ports, have promised
to deal with the situation as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> 8 Percent Economic Growth in Central Chinese Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The economy in China's
Hunan Province picked up in April and ended the sluggish first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, the province has had a GDP of
nearly 132 billion yuan, an 8.1 percent rise from the same 1997
period, a change that analysts attribute to fixed assets
investment, which helped stimulate demand.
</P>
<P>
During that period, the province put more than 20 billion yuan
into fixed assets, up 19 percent from the same 1997 period, mainly
in water conservation, power, transportation, and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the province had 9.35 billion yuan in industrial
output value in June, up 15 percent from June of 1997, and nearly
25.6 billion yuan in added value from agricultural production, up
3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hunan has used price adjustment to stimulate consumer
spending. In the first half, retail prices fell 2.7 percent and
the consumer price index was down 0.6 percent from the same period
of 1997. Retail sales were about 52.7 billion yuan, an 8.6 percent
rise from the same 1997 period.

<HEADLINE> Hainan's Economy Maintains Growth Momentum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The island province of Hainan saw
an economic growth rate of 6.9 percent in the first half of this
year, with its gross domestic product reaching 19.238 billion yuan
(2.3178 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
This momentum was not easy to achieve, because the island has
been developing as one of the country's most bubble-like economies
since becoming a province ten years ago. Many analysts have
previously said that it would be a miracle if the Hainan's economy
did not report a negative growth rate following excessively high
growth of 1992 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government attributes this steady growth to the
successful restructuring of the economy, away from the previous
emphasis on real estate development and toward the overall growth
of agriculture, industry, tourism and infrastructure investment.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Workers Brave Heat Wave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Millions of workers in Shanghai
have been braving the heat to try to keep production lines
operating as normal.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers of air conditioners, electric fans, and
refrigerators are operating at top speed to meet the soaring
market demands.
</P>
<P>
The heat wave has been around since June 30. On July 14, it
reached 38.6 degrees centigrade, a record high for July, since
1944.
</P>
<P>
Local industries produce 1.6 billion yuan worth of goods
daily for Chinese and overseas consumers, according to the
municipal government.
</P>
<P>
Record high temperatures have forced many factories to find
ways to protect workers. Shanghai Suoguang Electronics recently
spent 400,000 yuan on air conditioners and improved ventilation.
</P>
<P>
People working on the No. 2 Subway more than 20 meters below
ground say they seem to be in a sauna as underground temperatures
remain as high as 40-50 degrees centigrade and humidity hovers
around 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
The city's 30,000 power-supply workers are kept on a state of
emergency as transmission lines get overloaded and repair teams
rush to sites of shutdowns caused by excessive use of power.
</P>
<P>
Local vendors of refreshment may be among the happiest. Output
at the Shanghai Guangming Food Company in the first half of this
month has far surpassed that of all of July in previous years,
according to General Manager Yang Weiliang.

<HEADLINE> Britannica Unveils New Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELOS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Encyclopedia Britannica took
its first major step Wednesday to compete with some Internet sites
that have supplanted it online.
</P>
<P>
Britannica, one of the best-known in the publishing industry,
launched a new web site aiming to become a major research tool for
internet surfers.
</P>
<P>
The new free service of Britannica, named eBLAST, is a Web
navigation service featuring a searchable and browsable directory
of more than 125,000 sites selected by the company's editors for
their quality and usefulness, said the company in an announcement.
</P>
<P>
eBLAST also offers a forum for today's leading writers and
thinkers.
</P>
<P>
eBLAST is not designed to replace the encyclopedias the company
has published since 1768. Britannica, with its headquarters based
in Chicago, still puts out book and CD_ROM versions of its
encyclopedias, and sells access to its electronic version on the
Internet for 85 U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The new Web navigation service, a "thinking person's guide to
the Web," as called by the company, aims to grab a piece of the
market dominated by better-known Internet brands such as Yahoo,
Excite and America Online.
</P>
<P>
Britannica is hoping to gain 5 percent of the market for
research-oriented internet searches by stressing quality over
quantity in its search results.
</P>
<P>
"eBLAST is an important step in redefining the role of the
encyclopedia in the digital age," said Britannica publisher Paul
Hoffman.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Minister on International Situation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, who
spoke about the international situation and President Clinton's
visit with senior officials today, said that developed countries
have adjusted strategic relations with each other to get a better
strategic position.
</P>
<P>
They want a better environment for development, Tang said, as
the current international situation causes important and profound
changes in relations and things become multi-polar.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic activities are more active, with strategic relations
or partnerships characterised by equality, mutual benefit, and
mutual respect being formed, he said, and these are not for
confrontation and not alliances targeted at a third country.
</P>
<P>
They try instead to seek a common ground while dealing with
differences in a flexible way, he said.
</P>
<P>
This adjustment is the outcome of multi-polization and at the
same time speeds up the multi-polization process, Tang
said.

<P>
With greater strength in the international arena, developing
countries on the whole have become an important force for the
development of multi-polization, which is in the interest of all
countries in the long run, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Economic factors have played an increasingly important role in
international relations, with economic globalization and
regionalization growing so fast that competition has become more
fierce, he said, but countries are also trying to increase
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that economic globalization has brought enormous
opportunities for the development of the economy of the world as a
whole and all countries, and tough challenges that are mixed with
risk, especially for developing nations so that economic security
now is getting more attention.
</P>
<P>
Some new destabilizing factors like the Asian financial crisis
and South Asian nuclear tests have also emerged, he said, and in
this China also faces unprecedented opportunities and tough
challenges.
</P>
<P>
As long as China sticks to Deng Xiaoping's ideas on diplomacy
and an independent foreign policy of peace, he said, China, under
the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee
with Jiang Zemin at the core, can use these opportunities to
create a new situation in diplomacy.

Tang said that President Clinton's visit was a major event in
Sino-U.S. relations and the two countries made progress in their
partnership and decided to continue efforts to forge relations
oriented with the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan issue has been the most important and sensative part
of the bilateral ties, he said, and the key to healthy growth of
Sino-U.S. ties lies in strict adherence to the three
Sino-U.S. joint communiques.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. said that it will adhere to the "One China" policy and
observe the principles of the three Sino-U.S. communiques.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, President Clinton made a public commitment for the
first time not to support Taiwan independence or "One China, One
Taiwan", or "Two Chinas", or Taiwan's entry into any international
organizations composed of sovereign countries, Tang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese are willing to increase talks and cooperation with
the U.S., he said, to seek common ground, and deal with
differences properly for the development of Sino-U.S. relations.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Stock Market Finishes Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Share prices moved up on the
Singapore Stock Market Thursday as firmer regional currencies and
a Wall Street inspired rally in regional stocks helped push local
shares to a rise for the second consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) rebounded
by 17.26 points to close at 1073.96 points.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said share prices finished higher because most regional
currencies appreciated against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Regional currencies were being pulled up by the Japanese yen
which is moving higher against the U.S. dollar, they noted.
</P>
<P>
The total turnover dropped to 90.96 million shares worth
196.61 million Singapore dollars (about 116.43 million U.S.
dollars). Advances led declines by 145 to 121 while 324 stocks
remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
TAC 200 was the most active stock as it registered a turnover
of 8.85 million units. It was followed by SingTel which had 7.07
million counters done. UIC was next with 6.10 million shares
changing hands.
</P>
<P>
SPH was the top gainer of the day as it edged up 50 cents to
end at 12.20 Singapore dollars. DBS increased by 45 cents to
finish at 9.65 Singapore dollars. UOB inched up 30 cents to close
at 5.65 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Bwii was the biggest loser as it lost 39 cents
to finish at 0.90 Hong Kong dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The heat wave has been blamed
for 50 deaths and withering crops throughout the southern states
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday was the 23rd day this year that the temperature hit
or exceeded 38 degrees centigrade in the Dallas area, and the 10th
in a row. It was 40 degrees centigrade Wednesday afternoon at Love
Field airport in Dallas, according to reports reaching here late
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, intense heat in southern Arizona set several
records, including a new peak of 47 degrees in the area near the
Arizona-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
The heat wave has stretched from Arizona into Colorado and east
to Florida. But it has been particularly deadly across the
southern states, causing 25 deaths in Texas, 6 deaths in Oklahoma
and at least 20 in Louisiana since mid-May.
</P>

Sources said that many of those killed by the searing heat had
heart disease or other medical problems before their deaths. All

"This is definitely the hottest summer since 1980," said Roland
Nunez, a meteorologist of National Weather Service in Fort Worth.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israel's Trade With Egypt Slides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel's trade with Egypt fell
to 32.7 million U.S. dollars in the first half of this year, down
46 percent from the same period last year, the latest report
issued by the Central Bureau of Statistics showed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Exports to Egypt dropped to 24.5 million dollars from 28.5
million, while imports to 8.2 million dollars from 12.2 million,
the Jerusalem Post quoted the report as reporting.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Industry and Trade Ministry attributed the decline to a
lack of contacts between Israeli and Egyptian business communities
as result of the absence of a good diplomatic environment.
</P>
<P>
"The political situation creates fears among businessmen who
might otherwise be interested in advancing dealings," said Gabby
Bar, head of the ministry's Middle East Trade Department.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian commercial counselor in Israel Magdi Farahat also said
that the Israeli-Egyptian trade has been harmed by the stalled
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Egypt have even failed to realize 50 percent of
their trade potential and "there is no longer the wish to push it
forward," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel Export Institute's Director-General Amir Hayek said he
did not believe that those people who are doing good business
with Egypt will stop their activities due to the stalemate in the
peace process. But even he acknowledged that the political
situation hampers the establishment of new business ties.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report said exports to Jordan climbed in the
first half of this year to 13.4 million dollars from 6.8 million
in the same period last year, as imports rose to 7.1 million
dollars from 6.2 million, a 14 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
Hayek said trade ties with Jordan have developed at a rapid
pace partly due to its geographic proximity, compared with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Bar said trade agreements signed earlier this year and the
increasing exchange of businessmen between the two countries help
the Israeli-Jordanian trade boom.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan are the first two Arab countries to make peace
with Israel. But the Egyptian-Israeli ties have remained strained
while Israel keeps warm relations with Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Hawkish Minister Warns against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli National Infrastructure
Minister Ariel Sharon, the leading hawk in the Likud-led
coalition, has warned of a government downfall if it accepts a 14
percent overall troop redeployment, the Haaretz daily said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sharon told a turbulent three-hour session of the Inner Cabinet
chaired Wednesday by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the
government would be toppled if it accepted a 13.1 percent
withdrawal from the West Bank in the second stage and an
additional 1 percent in the third.
</P>
<P>
The coalition would be brought down by a Knesset (Parliament)
vote of no-confidence, although not necessarily on the withdrawal
issue since the opposition Labor Party might support the
decision. But it could fall on future no-confidence vote on any
other issue, Sharon said.
</P>
<P>
Sharon complained several times during the meeting, which was
also attended by Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Industry
and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky, that Israel was too liberal in
the negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The hawkish minister, who will leave for a 12-day trip to China
and Mongolia later Thursday, cautioned his colleagues against
making any new decisions over the redeployment during his absence.
</P>
<P>
"If you decide on anything while I'm away, my position should
be known to you in advance: I oppose any pullback that exceeds 9
percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Mordechai also clashed with Netanyahu at
the meeting over the agenda of the direct talks between him and
Palestinian officials, that are expected soon.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai was unhappy about the limitation set by the inner
cabinet that he should only talk about two issues -- the
cancellation of those clauses in the Palestinian Covenant calling
for Israel's destruction and the scope of next Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
As far as the withdrawal was concerned, Mordechai was asked by
Netanyahu to discuss the nature of the newly-designated Area D,
which is among the 13.1 percent areas due to be handed over to
Palestinian administrative control.
</P>
<P>
According to Israel's plans, the Israeli army will retain the
right to re-enter the Area D for security reasons after the
withdrawal while the Palestinians will be barred from building in
the area.
</P>
<P>
The issue of the Area D is reported to be among the main
disputes in talks between Israel and the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) has reiterated that
the 13.1 percent withdrawal proposed by the U.S. would never be
renegotiated.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli Allied Militiaman Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A member of the Israeli allied
South Lebanon Army was killed in south Lebanon Thursday morning in
guerrilla attacks, the Orient radio reported here.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, launched
attacks with machineguns and rockets at several posts manned by
Israeli troops and the SLA militiamen in the western sector of the
Israeli-occupied zone, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, Israeli warplanes heavily pounded suspected
targets of Hezbollah in Iqlim al-Toufah, a Hezbollah stronghold
which faces the occupied zone, and the villages in the western
sector of the zone, destroying several civilian houses.
</P>
<P>
The latest killing brought to 15 the death toll of the SLA
militiamen so far this year. Israel has lost eight soldiers in
clashes with Hezbollah fighters.
</P>
<P>
Israel has occupied the 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in
south Lebanon since 1985, and the heavy loss of lives of its
troops there has sparked increasing calls in the Jewish state to
withdraw its troops from the region.
</P>
<P>
In April, Israel for the first time in 20 years approved the
United Nations Resolution 425 calling for its withdrawal, but it
conditioned its implementation on security guarantees from the
Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon rejected the offer, insisting the withdrawal must be
carried out unconditionally as stipulated in the resolution.

BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- China has offered not only

to make greater efforts in order to prevent the situation from
aggravating, Tang noted.

strategic choice, and will stick to the cause of peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
Arafat expressed the hope that China will play a greater role
in promoting the peace talks out of deadlock and achieve a
comprehensive settlement including Syria and Lebanon.
</P>

Chinese leaders appreciate and encourage Palestine to adopt a
flexible and pragmatic position and continue the Middle East peace
process, Tang said, adding that China supports the Middle East

cause until a comprehensive and just peace is realized in Middle
East.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Venture Capital Up 31 Percent in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Venture capital-backed
companies in the United States received 3.2 billion U.S. dollars
in financing during the first quarter of 1998, a professional
services firm reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This represented a 31 percent increase over the same period
last year, said Coopers &AMP; Lybrand. The firm's survey also found
that the average size of each financing was 4.6 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 3.2 billion dollars invested in the first
quarter, venture capitalists also participated in 2.8 billion
dollars of private equity deals that included leveraged buyout,
growth equity and recapitalization financings.
</P>
<P>
From a U.S. industry standpoint in the first quarter,
technology-based companies received approximately 68 percent of
the investment. Communications companies were on the top draw,
receiving 800 million dollars, followed by software investments,
totaling 724 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
As an indication of the strong interest in a variety of
businesses that have grown out of the popularity of the Web,
start-up Internet companies gathered 540 million dollars in 114
financings during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the online industry has become the biggest recipient
of money from venture capitalists, who provide funding to young
companies in exchange for a stake in the business.
</P>
<P>
From a geographic point of view, California received the lion's
share of venture capital funding in the quarter, with 1.2 billion
dollars, followed by Massachusetts at 321 million dollars.

"These improvements were due largely to the reduction in

<HEADLINE> First Flood Peak on Yellow River Passes Xiaolangdi Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 16 (Xinhua) --This year's first flood peak on
the middle reaches of the Yellow River smoothly passed the ongoing
Xiaolangdi water control project at 17:00 hours on July 15.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Yellow River Flood Control and Drought Relief
Headquarters based in Zhengzhou, capital of Henan Province, said
that the flood peak was recorded at 5,100 cu. m. when it hit the
reservoir at Xiaolangdi.
</P>
<P>
The flow of the first flood peak downstream from the reservoir
was 4,460 cu.m. per second. The flood peak arrived earlier and
was faster than that of last year's on the Yellow River, said
sources from the flood control office of the Xiaolangdi water
control project.
</P>
<P>
By 20:00 hours yesterday the flood began to recede, and by
early morning today the water flow at Xiaolangdi was recorded at
3,670 cu. m. per second.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the Xiaolangdi project continued as planned
despite the torrential rains.
</P>
<P>
The flood peak was first formed during July 11-12 when
torrential and heavy rains hit some areas in Shanxi and Shaanxi
provinces. At 22:00 hours on July 13, the Longmen Flood
Monitoring Station on the middle reaches of the Yellow River
recorded the flood peak at 7,100 cu.m. per second.
</P>
<P>
This flood peak was also the first to pass the Xiaolangdi
hydrologic station since the Xiaolangdi project successfully
dammed the Yellow River in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
Three other tunnels were put into use for diverting water via
the Xiaolangdi project construction area. These tunnels are
said to be able to pass floods with a flow capacity of 8,700
cu. m. per second.
</P>
<P>
The Xiaolangdi Water Control Project is the largest of its kind
on the Yellow River. In terms of workload, it is second only to
the Three Gorges Project on the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
The project, located 40 km north of the ancient city of Luoyang
in Henan Province, controls an encatchment of 694,000 sq km, 92.3
percent of the total along the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to prevent flooding and ice runs and reduce
silting. It will also function as water supplier, irrigator and
power generator.
</P>
<P>
The estimated cost of the project is around 40 billion yuan,
and there is a plan to use more than one billion U.S. dollars in
overseas funds.  Construction of the project began in September
1991 and is scheduled to be completed in the year 2001.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The consumers Price Index (CPI)
in New
Zealand is now 1.7 percent higher than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
According to government statistics, the CPI rose by 0.5 percent
in the
second quarter of this year. This rise follows an increase of 0.2
percent
in the first quarter and 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter of last
year.
</P>
<P>
The cost of mortgage interest increased by three percent in the
second
quarter, the highest since the third quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Cigarettes and tobacco products increased in price by 4.2
percent as a
result of a rise in tobacco tax. They are now 8.1 percent higher
than a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
Transport costs fell in the second quarter by 1.2 percent. The
main
contributors to this decrease were petrol prices dropping by 5.6
percent,
along with new and used car prices falling by one percent and 0.7
percent
respectively, as a result of the removal of vehicle tariffs.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Budget Deficit Swells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Government posted a
wider budget deficit of 24 billion pesos (585.4 million U.S.
dollars) by end-June compared with the 15.4 billion peso (375.6
million dollar) deficit as of end-May, according to the latest
figures released by the Department of Finance.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said the deficit was 10
percent lower than the preliminary estimate of 26.8 billion peso
(653.7 million dollar) shortfall in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
He blamed shortfalls in revenue collection for the government's
dismal fiscal performance, according to a Philippine Daily
Inquirer report on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A slowdown in business activities spawned by the region's
financial crisis reduced tax payments and triggered a decline in
imports, which in turn reduced duties collected by the Bureau of
Customs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu earlier warned that the budget deficit could swell to
70 billion pesos (1.7 billion dollars) this year if no steps are
taken to cut expenditures and raise tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
Total revenues collected by the government in the first half
stood at 219.1 billion pesos (5.3 billion dollars), 12 percent
less than the projected level of 249.3 billion pesos (6.1 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Government expenditures totaled 243.1 billion pesos (5.9
billion dollars), 2.5 percent lower than the programmed level of
249.3 billion pesos. The expenditures, however, rose 15 percent
from the same period a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Investors Optimistic About Chinese Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Despite Asia's current economic
recession, most American investors in China have expressed their
"prudent optimism" about the Chinese economy, saying their
confidence is not affected by the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Among the 162 businessmen responding to a recent survey by the
American Chamber of Commerce in China, more than 60 percent say
that problems in other parts of Asia will not hinder their
investment in China, and 33 percent plan to promote their
businesses in the country to counter the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The survey has brought to light U.S.investors' faith in the
Chinese economy, though their successful operations depend on good
Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
The survey, following a similar one conducted last December,
raised four questions for Chamber members concerning their
business operations in China over the next year.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, U.S. investors see no change for their
business prospects in China, with 61 percent expressing prudent
confidence, five percentage points more than last year's 56
percent.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 90 percent say they intend to expand their business in
China within three to five years, and eighty percent plan to hire
more Chinese employees.
</P>
<P>
The problems encountered in China by the respondents include
limits on their business scope, lack of transparency in laws and
regulations, difficulties in employing local personnel, and high
tariffs and taxes.

BEIRUT, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel has dismissed as "baseless"
a report that it plans to withdraw from south Lebanon
unilaterally and establish a puppet state there, the Lebanese
Daily Star newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a senior Israeli security source as saying
that Israel has no intention of withdrawing unilaterally from
south Lebanon at present and "therefore any speculation about this
is baseless."
</P>
<P>
The Paris-based Arabic-language weekly al-Watan al-Arab last
week quoted "well-informed sources" as saying that following a
sudden Israeli withdrawal, the Israeli allied South Lebanese
Army militiamen would head a military government in a "state of
Free Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
"Israel has a policy which is based on the cabinet decision of
April 1 to pull the army out in the framework of (the United
Nations Security Council) Resolution 425 with security
guarantees," the source said.
</P>
<P>
In announcing its endorsement of the U.N. resolution, Israel
also demanded the Lebanese government negotiate security
arrangements before carrying out the unilateral pullout.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has rejected the offer, insisting that the withdrawal
should be unilateral and unconditional according to the resolution.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 to allegedly protect its northern areas from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese Muslim guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> Kodak: Profit Up, Sales Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Eastman Kodak Co., the world's
largest photographic film maker, reported Wednesday a 35-percent
profit growth in the second quarter, though its sales fell by 8
percent during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Kodak, suffering from a financial slump since December last
year, said it earned 495 million U.S. dollars in the April-June
quarter, up from 368 million dollar a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
However, its sales still fell by 6 percent to 3.54 billion
dollars from 3.85 billion dollars during the same period.
</P>
<P>
The company took a tumble last year when its Japanese rival
Fuji slashed color-film prices and grabbed 3 to 4 percentage
points of Kodak's market share, which dropped to around 65
percent. Kodak was forced to cut costs by 1.5 billion dollar last
winter and trim 19,900 out of the 100,500 jobs by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Kodak said it recovered around 1 percentage point of the market
share in the United States in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
"We were all very encouraged by the quarter," said the
company's chief financial officer Harry Kavetas. "It's the first
good quarter in some time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Industrial analysts were also impressed by the growth. "it is
minimal but it is a reversal, so it's significant," said Rebecca
Runkle, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, adding that "they are
positioning themselves to be certainly more competitive than they
have been."
</P>
<P>
For the first half of the year, Kodak earned 720 million
dollars, up from 517 million dollars a year ago. First half year
revenue amounted to 6.67 billion dollars, down from 7.09 billion
dollars during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The results are better than Wall Street had expected and
Kodak's stock surged more than 10 percent in the early trading.

<HEADLINE> Heat Wave Kills Six in Nanjing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The current heat wave in Nanjing,
capital city of east China's Jiangsu Province, has claimed six
lives and left more than 100 others suffering from heat stroke.
</P>
<P>
Local hospitals report that most of the victims are senior
residents, pregnant women and children. Some younger people
involved in strenuous exercise were also included, according to
today's China Youth Daily.
</P>
<P>
The city's meteorological department reported that temperatures
had climbed above 38 degrees Celsius, the highest in ten years.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing, together with Nanchang, Wuhan and Chongqing, are known
as China's "furnaces."
</P>
<P>
The heat wave has led to a surge in the demand for air
conditioners in Nanjing. However, after several years of more
moderate temperatures, ill-prepared air-conditioner manufacturers
and stores have been unable to satisfy the demand.
</P>
<P>
The city has issued an appeal to air-conditioner producers and
stores nationwide to help take up the slack.
</P>
<P>
The normal life of Nanjing residents has been affected by
several power outages reportedly caused by high electricity
consumption.
</P>
<P>
City services are remaining on alert to deal with any problems
stemming from the hot weather, said a city official.
</P>
<P>
Heat waves have hit many cities on the middle and lower reaches
of the Yangtze River, the longest river in China.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei Province, is sweltering
in temperatures up to 39 degree Celsius, and residents there have
been flocking to swimming pools to escape the heat.
</P>
<P>
Animals in the Wuhan City Zoo are also groaning under the
blazing sun, according to today's "Beijing Youth Daily," which
features the photo of a tiger enjoying a cold shower from the zoo
keeper.
</P>
<P>
The paper says Shanghai has also been reeling from searing heat
in recent weeks, with daily temperature remaining above 34 degrees.
</P>
<P>
Some experts attribute the prolonged hot spell to the El Nino
phenomenon.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Foreign Trade Continues Growth in First Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The import and export volume of
south China's Guangdong Province, the country's most dynamic
economic powerhouse, climbed 8.7 percent in the first half of this
year to 62.69 billion U.S. dollars, according to just-released
customs statistics.
</P>
<P>
This figure accounts for 41.6 percent of the national total for
the period.
</P>
<P>
The province had a trade surplus of 11.04 billion U.S. dollars,
according to official figure.
</P>
<P>
Imports inched up by six percent to 25.83 billion U.S. dollars
in the first half. This low growth rate was attributed to
shortage of floating funds at foreign-trade companies and a weak
domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
It has also been blamed on strict state control of the
importation of processing industry goods such as vegetable oil,
sugar, wool, cotton and finished oil products.
</P>
<P>
Exports amounted to 36.8 billion U.S. dollars, up 10.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Major export items were machinery and textile products. Exports
of machinery alone earned 15.85 billion U.S. dollars, a surge of
16.3 percent over the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
The province's exports featured a larger proportion going to
European and American countries. In the Jan-June period,
Guangdong's exports to the United States were up by 15.7 percent,
to 8.42 billion U.S. dollars, and those to the the European Union
up by 23 percent, to 4.74 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The province's exports to Asian countries totaled 21.1 billion
U.S. dollars, an increase of only four percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan business community has
imported investment goods worth 625 million U.S. dollars during
the first five months of this year, according to the Ministry of
Industrial Development sources Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said these goods were for new industries and to
upgrade and modernize the existing industries using the incentives
offered by the government.
</P>
<P>
This capital formation is expected to help strengthen the local
industrial sector to meet the needs in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The main aim of providing such concession to these industries
was to equip them with modern machinery and equipment so as to
make them competitive in the world market, they pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the investment goods imported, local industries
had also imported about 1.3 billion dollars worth of intermediary
goods from January to May this year due to the expansion of the
production activities of the existing factories.
</P>
<P>
Between 1995 and 1997 over 600 large industries and 2,446 small
and medium new industries started providing employment to a large
number of persons.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,241 existing small industries also expanded their
production capacity during this period.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the government-owned industries and big private
ventures have also shown significant improvement.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Compaq Computer Corp., the
world's largest personal computer maker, reported a substantial
net loss in the second quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Compaq said it had a net loss of 3.6 billion U.S. dollars in
the quarter, compared with net profit of 257 million dollars in
the same period a year earlier. Company revenues rose from 5.5
billion dollars to 5.8 billion dollars, according to reports
reaching here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The loss was related to its purchase of Digital Equipment
Co. and plant closings, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Compaq spent 3.63 billion dollars on acquisition of Digital
Equipment on June 11 and close of selected Compaq facilities
following the acquisition.
</P>
<P>
It announced last month that it was closing six plants overseas
and eliminating 5,000 jobs, including 1,000 at its Houston
headquarters as part of a previously announced cost-cutting drive
following the Digital acquisition.
</P>
<P>
However, Compaq chief executive officer Eckhard Pfeiffer said
in a statement that the company had achieved its goal of reducing
inventory backlogs among distributors of its corporate PC
lines. The backlogs had hurt its competitiveness versus other PC
makers and had dampened earnings results in the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Sales for the first half rose slightly to 11.5 billion dollars
from 10.8 billion dollars a year ago.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Some Senate Democrats voiced
their anger Wednesday at Senate Republican Leader Trent Lott for
using the issue of alleged technology transfer to China to reap
political benefits.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the Senate Intelligence Committee empowered to
lead a Senate investigation of possible leaks of sensitive
satellite technology to China, Democrats blasted Lott for jumping
to conclusions in the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Lott told a press conference Tuesday that an interim conclusion
was that United States control of sensitive technology exports
were "wholly inadequate", and China benefited militarily from
launching American commercial satellites.
</P>
<P>
His comments sparked heated attacks from Democrats on the
panel. Senator Robert Kerrey, vice chairman of the committee, said
Lott had "put our ability to function at great risk."
</P>
<P>
"He could not pass up the opportunity to turn our partially
completed efforts into momentary political advantage," Kerrey said.
</P>
<P>
Michigan Democratic Senator Carl Levin, who is involved in the
probe by three Senate committees, said: "To my knowledge, not one
of the Senate committees investigating the allegations have
reached these conclusions."
</P>
<P>
The Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, a
Republican, said that Lott could have his interim conclusion, but
the committee would "follow the facts regardless of politics."
</P>
<P>
David Tarbell, director of the Defense Technology Security
Administration, testified to the committee that allowing American
companies to launch their satellites atop Chinese rockets was not
at the expense of U.S. national security.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the safeguards that we have in place on these
activities, combined with the monitoring program, significantly
reduce the risk to national security," Tarbell said.
</P>
<P>
Tarbell had presented himself both to the Intelligence
Committee in closed session and to other committees for testimony
along with many other officials from different government
departments.
</P>
<P>
The White House stated that it provided Congress committees
with relevant documents to disprove the charges by the Republicans
for the alleged lack of protection of U.S. sensitive technology.
</P>
<P>
Kerrey questioned if the committee should spend too much time
on the inquiry. "I do not think this hearing is the best use of
this committee's time."
</P>
<P>
He believed that the committee was "over-concentrating" on the
matter, ignoring other important issues such as nuclear tension in
South Asia and violence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Senate and House each set up four committees to investigate
whether the Hughes Electronics Corp. and Loral Space and
Communications Ltd illegally gave China sensitive data after
failed launches of their satellites in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Governments of China and the United States as well as
companies involved in the business have all denied any
wrongdoings. But it is uncertain when the inquiries will end.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Eases Ban on Illegal Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has decided to
allow some 95,000 illegal foreign workers to work in five specific
occupations for another one year, Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai
Rattakul said.
</P>
<P>
The decision followed complaints from proprietors who were set
to suffer a serious shortage of workers should the foreign labor
be deported by the July 10 deadline, said Bhichai, who chairs a
sub-committee in charge of tackling the problem of alien workers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier rice millers had staged protests against the
government's ultimatum to deport their alien workers. A survey
showed that 44 kinds of businesses located in 53 provinces had
been trying in vain to recruit about 230,327 local workers to
replace the alien workforce.
</P>
<P>
"After the consideration, the sub-committee agreed that there
should be a relaxation on the ban in five occupations, in which
few Thais are employed," said Bhichai, quoted by Thursday's Nation
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The five businesses are rubber plantations, sugar cane
plantations, pig breeding, rice mills and water transport.
</P>
<P>
About 88,000 alien workers in 39 other occupations will face
deportation when their temporary working licenses expire on
November 29, said Bhichai.
</P>
<P>
However, Bhichai insisted that the government was still
remaining firm on its policy to deport 300,000 illegal workers
from the country within the year.
</P>
<P>
He said that from January until July 10, the Police Department
had deported 230,327 illegal workers. There are about 500,000
illegal workers still residing in Thailand, according to Bhichai.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is trying to find short- and long-term
measures to solve the problem. As for the short-term measures,
Bhichai said the government would allow alien workers to continue
working in five occupations suffering from shortfalls of
personnel.
</P>
<P>
The long-term measure would be the deportation of all alien
workers at an appropriate time.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why Trade Deficit in Latin America Keeps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The persisting Asian
economic crisis is to blame as one of the major causes for the
continuously increasing trade deficit in Latin America, local
economists say.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficits of Colombia and Chile in June represented
six percent of their gross domestic product (GDP). In Brazil it
was 4.5 percent of its GDP, in Argentina and Mexico three percent,
higher than the average deficit of 2.9 percent registered in the
region as a whole in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The economists said the Asian economic crisis had affected
trade performance in the region either directly or indirectly.
</P>
<P>
Currency devaluations in Asian economies has reduced the
competitiveness of Latin American goods in Asian markets. This has
resulted in an income fall of 2.1 billion dollars in the seven
most important Latin American countries: Argentina, Brazil,
Mexico, Chile, Venezuela, Colombia and Peru.
</P>
<P>
Besides the exports decline, imports of many other countries
were also down due to the crisis. As a result, prices of raw
materials kept dropping on the international market.
</P>
<P>
The price drops deeply affected Latin America countries, which
are much dependent on exports of raw materials, such as crude oil,
copper and cereals, among others.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela, Colombia, Mexico and Ecuador have experienced a
dramatic reduction of crude oil exports. Venezuela, for example,
sold six billion dollars worth of oil, much less than planned.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chilean copper exports, coffee sales by Brazil and
Colombia and cereal exports of Argentina and Brazil all had a
down-turn.
</P>
<P>
The depreciation of Asian currencies made it possible for
Asian economies to produce and market their products at a
relatively low cost. These products have replaced Latin American
goods in the industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
Latin American exports to the United States, Japan and European
countries have decreased by 7.6 billion dollars. Mexico lost 4.28
billion dollars and was the nation that suffered most, followed by
Brazil with a 1.583 billion dollars loss and Argentina with 492
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the Asian crisis, other internal causes in these
countries have helped contribute to their economic problems.
</P>
<P>
The adverse consequences began after Latin American countries
began economic and financial reforms based on the model proposed
by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Without considering
their economic circumstances, they opened their markets and
imposed drastic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The measures taken encouraged excessive consumption, which led
to an imports rise.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the Latin America Economic System showed that
between 1990 and 1997, the trade deficit in the region showed a
steady increase, from 2.1 percent of the gross national product
(GNP) in 1996 to 2.9 percent last year. The deficit is estimated
to be higher than four percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The economists said the rise of the deficit would certainly
affect economic growth in the region. A growth rate of 3.5 percent
is projected for Latin America in 1998, two percent lower than
last year.
</P>
<P>
At present, some Latin American countries have resorted to
selling dollars in an effort to balance their deficits.

on about one-tenth of the affected 866,600 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Since mid June, flocks of locusts have been attacking areas
around Qinghai Lake and caterpillars are infesting pastures in the
southern area of the province, one of China's major pasture lands.
</P>
<P>
The situation is so grave that the pest density in five large
pasture regions encompassing 333,000 hectares in the lake area has
reached 82.9 locusts per square meter. The highest density has
been measured at 400 locusts and 1,000 caterpillars per square
meter.
</P>
<P>
The province predicts that this catastrophe will reduce the
amount of fresh grass by 20 to 80 percent in affected areas.
</P>
<P>
So far, the province has completed the combat against the
insects in about 66,660 hectares of pasture land, and is fighting
in another 30,000 hectares.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Merapi ash Hits Town 150 km Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The volcanic ash spewed by Mt.
Merapi in Central Java, Indonesia, has fallen on parts of Gombong
town, Kebument regency, about 150 kilometers west of the volcano,
reports reaching here Thursday from Magelang said.
</P>
<P>
Merapi, the most active volcano in Indonesia, erupted last
Saturday but no casualty has been reported.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Volcanology Directorate's research office in
Magelang, Central Java, Ratdomopurbo said Wednesday a strong
easterly wind blew the ash over the town.
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time volcanic ash ever fell on this town," the
report quoted a resident as saying.
</P>
<P>
Despite its warning status has been lowered from "danger" level
to "alert" level two days ago, residents living near the volcano
were still asked to remain on alert Wednesday, particularly for
hot clouds that followed the volcano's lava flows.
</P>
<P>
"By 6:00 p.m. the mountain had spewed hot clouds five times,"
Ratdomopurbo said.
</P>
<P>
Merapi lies in Central Java, one of the world's most densely
populated areas. But residents in the ancient royal capital of
Yogyakarta, a city of 2 million people, said they were not
affected by the fresh volcanic activity.
</P>
<P>
Residents of villages near the volcano have been warned to get
ready for evacuation and dams have been built to channel the lava
if it begins to flow in earnest.
</P>
<P>
In November 1994, Merapi killed 60 people when it erupted
without warning.

<HEADLINE> American Scientists Link Hair Loss to Thyroid Hormone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Abnormally low levels of a key
thyroid hormone may cause alopecia, a medical condition
characterized by significant hair loss, a study shows.
</P>
<P>
The study was published this week in the Archives of
Dermatology, a journal published by the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
The condition, which affects four million people in the United
States, was always presumed to be an auto-immune disease, the
report said. But no one had ever been able to identify immune
markers.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the Nassau County Medical Center on Long Island
tested the blood of 18 alopecia patients and 69 healthy people,
and determined that the patients had a 50 percent lower level of a
thyroid substance called calcitonin gene-related peptide
(CGRP). The substance, first identified in the mid-1980s, is a
potent blood-vessel dilator, allowing blood to flow more easily.
</P>
<P>
"Blood doesn't flow to the area and the hair falls out," the
researchers so explained their findings.
</P>
<P>
Although the finding pointed directly to the thyroid
abnormality, the researchers said, there was also evidence that
CGRP had a role in mediating immune-system responses such as
inflammation.
</P>
<P>
Biopsies from patients routinely showed white blood cells
attacking the hair root, they said, noting that more CGRP might
lessen the attack.
</P>
<P>
According to a study last year endorsed by the American Academy
of Dermatology, hair loss has many causes. The most common is
hereditary baldness, and androgenetic alopecia (AGA), which is
autosomal dominant. Contributing factors to hair loss include
drugs, endocrine disorders (diabetes, thyroid), anemia,
auto-immune disease, stress, hormones, surgery, pregnancy,
nutritional and metabolic deficiencies.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Headway in New and Renewable Energy Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- China has made remarkable progress
in developing new and renewable energy from water, solar, wind,
geothermal and tidal sources, according to a senior official at
the State Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
To date, the country's annual utilization rate of new and
renewable energy has reached the equivalent of 300 million tons of
standard coal, accounting for a quarter of the national
consumption of primary energy and more than 47 percent of energy
consumption in rural areas, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The country has also made progress in small hydropower
utilization. Nearly 7,000 small hydropower stations have been set
up with an installed capacity of 20 million kilowatts (kw),
generating more than 50 billion kwh of electricity, accounting for
25 percent of the total available.
</P>
<P>
Some 75 percent of rural households in China have installed
coal-saving stoves, and more than 5.7 million rural households use
bio-gas which is produced at an annual volume of 1.5 billion cubic
meters.
</P>
<P>
As for solar energy, there are 5 million square meters of solar
heaters, 6 million square meters of solar-heated housing, 40,000
square meters of solar greenhouses for agricultural uses and
150,000 solar stoves.
</P>
<P>
Wind energy is also being used for electricity generation. At
present, 160,000 household use mini-and small-sized wind
generators with a combined capacity of 15,000 kw, mostly
distributed in remote pastoral, mountain and island areas. China
has imported medium-and large-sized wind generators from Denmark,
the Netherlands and the United States to equip 15 power plants
with 120 generating units and a capacity of 30,000 kw.
</P>
<P>
China is also rich in tidal energy, 90 percent of which is
located in Zhejiang and Fujian Provinces. Some 10 tidal-power
stations have been set up nationwide with a total installed
capacity of 7,000 kw.
</P>
<P>
The reserves of small coal mines that can be exploited is
estimated at more than 10 billion tons, and they are being mined
for more than 500 million tons of coal annually, making up 40
percent of national raw coal production.

<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan province
is about to launch a massive anti-drug campaign to stem the flow

It will concentrate on stamping out cultivation of plants used
to make drugs, drug manufacturing, trafficking and drug abuse,
said director Sun Dahong.

In addition to stemming the influx of overseas drugs,
authorities have also set up a provincial-level department
responsible for managing 28 kinds of special chemical products in
the province, Sun said.

<HEADLINE> Italian Economy to Pick Up, but Little Impact on Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Italian economy would continue to
grow in 1998 and 1999, but with little effect on unemployment, the
National Economic Trend Studies Institute (ISCO) predicted
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In its biennial report, ISCO forecast that the gross domestic
product (GDP) of Italy would grow by 2.2 percent in 1998 and 2.7
percent in 1999, compared to a 1.4 percent growth in 1997 and 0.7
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending, which affects the economic growth to a large
scale, would increase by two percent in 1998 and 2.5 percent in
1999, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate, which dropped to 1.5 percent -- a 30-year
low -- last year, would rise to 1.8 percent this year but would
slide to 1.6 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Italy's efforts to consolidate its public finances would result
in a deficit-to-GDP ratio of two percent in 1999. The figure was
2.7 percent in 1997, said the report.
</P>
<P>
However, the positive trend in economic growth would do little
to improve the unemployment situation.
</P>
<P>
The report forecast a 12.1 percent jobless rate this year and
11.9 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Sustained growth needs to be combined with structural measures
which would increase the impact on labor demand." said the ISCO.

<HEADLINE> More Beijingers Watch TV News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Most Beijingers turn on their
television sets mainly to satisfy their cravings for news,
according to a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Public Opinion Research Institute
of the People's University of China, shows that 55 percent of
viewers watch news programs regularly, and two-third view them
often.
</P>
<P>
The most popular program is the 30-minute "News Network"
broadcast by the official China Central Television (CCTV) at 7:00
p.m. every day, featuring all sorts of news stories from at home
and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The other ones favored by Beijingers include news commentary
programs on CCTV and the Beijing TV Station, the survey shows.
</P>
<P>
One example is CCTV's "Focus," a program on hot topics relating
to China's reform and people's daily life, with stories that often
expose corruption and criticize bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
Media experts say that the Chinese people in the 1990s have
become more enthusiastic about knowing what is going on in their
country and in the world, in an era of the information explosion
and stronger competition.
</P>
<P>
Millions of Chinese choose TV as their first source for
breaking news such as the live broadcasts during U.S. President
Bill Clinton's visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, many viewers believe that TV, often described as the
"First Media," provides the most comprehensive explanations about
the changing society.
</P>
<P>
"There have been reforms in recent years to make Chinese news
programs more transparent," said Yu Guoming, a mass-
communications scholar.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that most people hope the anchorpeople
will improve their images and appear more knowledgeable, humorous
and witty. In addition, three-fourths of the viewers hold that
"the ordinary people should have a bigger say in front of the
camera."

<HEADLINE> All-Natural Fast-food Container Passed State Assessment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- a new bio-degradable, all-natural
fast-food container designed to replace styrofoam and reduce white
pollution passed technical inspection on Wednesday, according to
today's "China's Daily."
</P>
<P>
Some 70 experts, government officials and entrepreneurs
gathered in Beijing and agreed that the technology, which
replaces styrofoam with a compound made of rice husks, wheat
shells and straw, peanut shells and other natural products to make
disposable take-out containers and plates, will vastly improve the
environment. The new disposables tested non-toxic, safe and
dissolvable.
</P>
<P>
Inventor Wang Youtong, a local official of Yichun city of east
China's Jiangxi Province, said that production cost for the
natural tableware is cheaper than paper products, but slightly
more expensive than using plastics.
</P>
<P>
Larger production scales would bring costs down and make the
ecologically sound tablewares competitive in domestic and
international markets, Wang added.
</P>
<P>
Liu Hanjie, secretary-general of the China Association of
Resources Comprehensive Utilization, predicted that all-natural
disposable tablewares competitive in Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
At present, China produces more than 7 billion fast food
containers, but recycles only a little, causing serious white
pollution.
</P>
<P>
As a large agricultural country, China has abundant rice husks,
wheat shells and straw, peanut shells as raw materials for making
bio-degradable disposable tablewares, Liu said.

<HEADLINE> German Government to Step Up Fight against Hooligans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The German government pledged on
Wednesday to step up the fight against soccer hooliganism, urging
police to seize potential troublemakers before they got anywhere
near a stadium.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Manfred Kanther said the country must not
forget the violence of German hooligans at the World Cup, which
left a French policeman in a coma with irreversible brain damage.
</P>
<P>
Kanther said Germany, which is bidding to host the 2006 World
Cup, must crack down harder on the hooliganism which also
accompanies big soccer matches at home.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference here, Kanther said investigators
estimated there were between 1,000 and 2,000 soccer hooligans in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The minister said it was time to make more use of laws allowing
police to slap travel bans on suspected hooligans, seize their
cars and, in extreme cases, take them into custody to avoid
trouble at major sports events.
</P>
<P>
Kanther said he had therefore proposed setting up a working
group with his counterparts in the states to examine how
anti-hooligan measures could be improved.

<HEADLINE> Shandong Seizes Smuggled Articles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province has
cracked down on smugglers involving 57 cases, with a total value
of 159 million yuan, or 19.156 million U.S. dollars, for the first
half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The busts resulted from the province's determination to
maintain order in the import and export market, China Daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The total value of smuggled goods from January to June
increased by 4.5 times that of the same period last year, said
officers with the Qingdao Customs.
</P>
<P>
Some smugglers have used Shandong's 22 open ports, disturbing
the legitimate export and import businesses, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Sixty percent of the smuggling cases for the first half of this
year involved front companies, with a total value of 146 million
yuan (17.59 million U.S. dollars), it said.
</P>
<P>
The smuggling of container-held goods slipped by the mail
service system or went undetected by sea customs.
</P>
<P>
Electronics, gold, cigarettes, chemicals, automobiles, steel
and computers were brought in to China, while cotton and foreign
currencies were smuggled out.
</P>
<P>
The Qingdao Customs has set up special systems for analyzing
and managing information, a help in cracking a batch of big
smuggling cases.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says NATO far From Intervening in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States Defense
Department said Wednesday that the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) is still far from using military force to
intervene in the conflict in the Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"From a policy perspective, we're not anywhere near making a
decision for any kind of armed intervention in Kosovo right now,"
a senior defense official told reporters at a Pentagon briefing.
</P>
<P>
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, stressed
that diplomacy remains the preferred route.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that diplomatic option was difficult too,
because of problems of ascertaining who was in charge of the
ethnic Albanian insurgency, and whether negotiations could be
organized.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the area has changed sharply since last month,
when NATO warplanes engaged in a show-of-force exercise designed
to intimidate the Serb-led forces of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic into halting attacks on ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the Serb attacks, the ethnic Albanian insurgent
force has swelled to about 2,000 hard-core members, plus tens of
thousands of supporters, the official said during the background
briefing.
</P>
<P>
An intelligence analyst said: "The Serbs have done, overall, to
date, rather poorly. They have not contained the growth of the
(insurgents), so it appears that there's no military solution to
the conflict."
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials also pointed out that NATO leaders,
including Defense Secretary William Cohen, have been adamant that
the alliance will not step in to support independence for Kosovo,
but will back increased autonomy within Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"They need to know... that the cavalry is not coming. We are
not supportive of Kosovo independence," a defense official told
reporters. "NATO planning is not an ostensible movement towards
some kind of a military action there."

<HEADLINE> Japanese Donation for Forestation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Japan yesterday donated 1.25
billion yen (8.93 million US dollars) worth of forestation
equipment to China in a bid to reduce silting of the largest
tributary of the Yangtze River, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
This is the first Sino-Japanese forestation project using
donations from the Japanese Government.
</P>
<P>
The donated equipment will be used to assist the conservation
projects in the upper reaches of the Hanjiang River, the Yangtze's
biggest tributary.
</P>
<P>
About 30,000 hectares of forest will be planted in the Hanjiang
River area and another 30,000 hectares of hillsides will be closed
to help reforestation.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to alleviate erosion in the upper
stretches of the Yangtze and clean the headwaters of China's
longest river.
</P>
<P>
Historically, the Yangtze River area, one of the most important
ecological and economic zones in China, has been densely
developed. Forests and other natural vegetation have been cleared
for farms, letting soil fill the river, which causes flooding.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve the ecological environment of the Yangtze
River area, the Chinese Government has decided to construct a
forest belt in the middle and upper stream of the river to slow
the continual silting.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investors would not be
permitted to engage in the businesses of aquaculture of fresh
water fishes, forest concession and press sectors, press reports
Thursday quoted a minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
The rulings on business sectors closed to foreign investment
were announced by Minister for Investment Hamzah Haz here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After meeting President B.J. Habibie at the presidential
office, Hamzah said foreigners would not be allowed to engage in
film production and cinematic services, spectrum management of
radio frequencies and satellite orbits, radio broadcasting
services, private television, newspapers and magazines.
</P>
<P>
Sectors closed to foreigners also include the exploitation of
uranium and sponges, liquor, fireworks, pentachlorophenol,
dieldrin and chlordane.
</P>
<P>
The minister told reporters that the government had also issued
a decree on business sectors allotted to small scale businessmen
and those opened to medium-large scale businesses under
partnership conditions.
</P>
<P>
Indirect investment by selling shares of Indonesian companies
through domestic stock exchanges would be exempted from the
rulings, Hamzah said.
</P>
<P>
Exemption would be granted to large-scale retail trade, such as
malls, supermarkets, department stores, distributors, restaurants,
quality certification services, market research services and
pre-sale services, he added.

<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States' Liberty Mutual
Group opened a representative office in southwest China's
Chongqing Municipality on Wednesday, according to today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
The move kicks off the group's campaign to get an operating
license in China, which the company believes is one of the world's
fastest growing insurance markets.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the office in this largest municipality in
China also marks a new phase in Chongqing's cooperation with
foreign financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Edmund Kelly, the group's president, said that cooperation
could include development of special international investment
promotion facilities to focus directly on investment in Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
As an investment arm of Liberty, Newport Pacific Management
has started discussions with the Chongqing Planning Commission
about investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Kelly said, cooperation may include assistance to
social security and social welfare authorities in studying various
development models for workers' injury insurance and for a
worker's compensation system.

<HEADLINE> Crude Futures Surge Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil futures surged to their
highest level in five weeks Wednesday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange after sharp declines in U.S. stockpiles indicated output
reductions by world oil producers may begin to pay off.
</P>
<P>
Crude for August delivery rose as much as 47 cents, or 3.2
percent, to 15.02 U.S. dollars a barrel, the highest since June 8.
It settled up 32 cents, at 14.87 U.S. dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil futures rose after the American Petroleum Institute's
report late Tuesday that showed stockpiles fell an unexpectedly
sharp 6.2 million barrels last week, to 334.7 million barrels.
Those figures were reinforced by the U.S. Department of Energy's
findings Wednesday of a 6.7 million barrel decline.
</P>
<P>
The dwindling of those inventories indicated output reductions
by world oil producers may begin to pay off. Traders are expecting
prices to rise in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
Other oil products also rose on the market.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Dollar Continues to Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian dollar's sliding
accelerated Wednesday, dropped off 40 U.S. cents to a record low
close of 67.16 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth all-time closing low in as many business days,
and there seems no end in sight to the continuing depreciation of
the loonie.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian currency opened at 67.49 U.S. cents on Wednesday's
North American markets.
</P>
<P>
It went downward all the way to 67.25 U.S. cents when the Bank
of Canada stepped in to buy the local currency.
</P>
<P>
But the intervention did not prove very effective in preventing
the loonie from continuing its plunge, according to reports here.
</P>
<P>
At this stage, there is not much that either the Bank of Canada
or the government can do to stop the plunge, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics Canada reported Wednesday that shipments by Canadian
manufacturers fell for the second month in a row.
</P>
<P>
It was the second sign in recent days that Canada's economy is
cooling off.
</P>
<P>
With the market aware of a slowing in growth, it would take a
large and sustained rate hike to help the loonie.
</P>
<P>
But it seemed unlikely that the Bank of Canada would raise
interest rates very soon as the money market had hoped, since it
could further slow the economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The bank's position was further bolstered Tuesday by Canadian
Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who said the low dollar is nothing
to worry about.
</P>
<P>
"It's not a question of being happy," he was quoted as saying.
"It's a reality of life."
</P>
<P>
Besides, a low dollar would boost both tourism and exports,
Chretien said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Three-Year ESAF Loan for Guyana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) Wednesday approved a three-year loan under the Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) equivalent to about 71
million U.S. dollars to support Guyana's economic program for
1998-2001.
</P>
<P>
The first annual loan of about 24 million dollars will be made
available in two equal semiannual installments, the first of them
shortly.
</P>
<P>
The 1998-2001 medium-term program seeks to attain satisfactory
growth within the context of low inflation, a strengthened balance
of payments position and a robust exit from the debt-rescheduling
process after the delivery of assistance under the Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries Initiative.
</P>
<P>
The program aims at achieving average real GDP growth of about
4 percent a year, a reduction in inflation to about 3.6 percent,
and a narrowing of the external current account deficit while
maintaining gross international reserves at the equivalent of four
to five months of imports.
</P>
<P>
Guyana joined the IMF in September 1966. Its quota is about 89
million dollars and its outstanding use of IMF financing currently
totals about 39 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> U.S. May Impose Sanctions on Russian Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Wednesday it will likely impose sanctions on nine Russian
enterprises that may have provided goods or services to help other
nations develop weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The White House identifies the enterprises as the INOR
scientific center, the Grafit and Ployus research institutes, the
Tikhomirov institute, Glavkosmos, the Komintern plant in
Novosibirsk, the MOSO company, Baltic State Technical University
and Europalace 2000.
</P>
<P>
"These enterprises are believed to have violated Russian export
controls and attempted to export goods or services which could
contribute to weapons of mass destruction or missiles to deliver
them," White House spokesman Michael McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
"Consistent with the Russian actions and where consistent with
our own assessment, the United States will suspend immediately any
U.S. government program or assistance to entities on this list and
will proceed expeditiously to impose trade restrictions on such
entities," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also welcomed an announcement of the Russian
government in Moscow that the government commission on export
control was conducting the special investigations.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that those steps indicate the seriousness to which
the Russian Federation has taken the expression of concern we've
made on certain technology transfers," McCurry told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"They involve a lot of the premier Russian enterprises that
have been involved in technology transfers and they could be very
significant," he said.

NEW YORK, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Technology shares here propelled
the Nasdaq market to a sixth straight record, but most stocks
pulled back Wednesday on Tuesday's rally.

The downturn was cushioned by a big gain from Eastman Kodak,
which surged the equivalent of nearly 35 Dow points after posting

one of the Dow 30 soared on profit news. J.P. Morgan rose more
than 7 points Tuesday after the investment bank beat analysts

UNITED NATIONS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of the

over the incident and over the safety of U.N. personnel in Lebanon.
They also fully supported the strong protest which UNIFIL made to
the Israeli authorities regarding that incident," he said.

Members of the council called on Israel to respect a commitment
it made in July 1996 to respect a safety zone around UNIFIL

<HEADLINE> World Bank Lending Rises Sharply in Fiscal 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- New lending commitments and
disbursements from the World Bank to client countries went up
sharply in fiscal 1998, which ended on June 30, this year.
</P>
<P>
Commitments were at a record 28.6 billion U.S. dollars as
against 19.1 billion dollars in fiscal 1997 and 21.4 billion
dollars in fiscal 1996, while disbursements were 25.5 billion
dollars as compared with nearly 20 billion dollars in fiscal 1997.
</P>
<P>
The figures include both the market-rate loans made by the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and
the concessional loans to the world's poorest countries provided
by the International Development Association (IDA).
</P>
<P>
The high level of commitments was due in large part to the
World Bank's quick response to the financial crisis in some East
African countries, which led to some reshaping of the loan
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Investing in people, or human development operations, remained
a major focus in fiscal 1998, with total lending for health,
population, nutrition, education and social support totaling some
6.435 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the East Asia and Pacific region received 9.62 billion
dollars in new IBRD/IDA commitments for 45 projects as against 4.9
billion dollars in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
New lending commitments to Africa in the year totaled 2.87
billion dollars for 59 projects as against 1.74 billion dollars in
fiscal 1997. Of the amount, 2.81 billion dollars were IDA
interest-free credits for 57 projects and only 57 million dollars
were IBRD loans.
</P>
<P>
In South Asia, 3.86 billion dollars in new IBRD/IDA commitments
were approved in the year for 25 projects as compared with the
combined lending of 2 billion dollars to the region in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The countries of Europe and Central Asia received the total
commitments of 5.22 billion dollars for 69 projects for fiscal
1998 as compared with 5.1 billion dollars in the year earlier.
Russia was the largest borrower in the region, receiving loans of
1.63 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The total new commitments to Latin America and the Caribbean in
fiscal 1998 stood at 6.04 billion dollars for 68 projects as
against 4.6 billion dollars in fiscal 1997. New commitments to the
countries of the Middle East and North Africa amounted to 968
million dollars for 20 projects, compared to 915 million dollars
in fiscal 1997.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Approves Waiver for India, Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Wednesday
approved a measure to give President Bill Clinton the authority to
waive most economic sanctions on India and Pakistan for up to one
year.
</P>
<P>
Republican Sen. Sam Brownback, who suggested to add the
amendment to broader legislation to fund the agricultural program,
said after a voice vote that "it provides the waiver on everything
but military sales."
</P>
<P>
The broader appropriations legislation which contains the
Brownback amendment must still be approved by the full Senate.
Once approved, it would advance to a joint Senate-House committee
for review.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration said a waiver would help the United
States negotiate with India and Pakistan to contain the nuclear
arms race in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
A waiver would also let Washington cushion the blow for
Pakistan, which has suffered more than neighboring India.
Brownback's measure could clear the way for the International
Monetary Fund to restart loan payments to Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Canada Releases Bank Merger Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Canada's competition watchdog
Competition Bureau released here Wednesday its guidelines that
will direct its study of two bank merger proposals of the country.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said that it will use the same basic rules it
normally applies to mergers in its review of the banking industry.
</P>
<P>
Four of Canada's largest six banks announced mergers early this
year, saying that they had to combine their resources to better
compete on the world market.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidelines, mergers will not be challenged where the
post-merger market share of the merging parties would be less than
35 percent, or the market share of the largest four firms in the
post-merger market would be less than 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the two proposed bank mergers would
control about 75 percent of the market share by Canadian banks.
Obviously, the watchdog will have to rule on the mergers.
</P>
<P>
The Competition Bureau said it will make its decision after the
country's Task Force on the banking mergers releases its report,
which is expected to be in the fall.
</P>
<P>
It will then make its recommendations to Finance Minister Paul
Martin, who will have the final say as to whether the bank mergers
will go ahead or not.

<HEADLINE> German Minister Calls for Tougher Action Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- German Interior Minister Manfred
Kanther Wednesday demanded tougher police actions against football
hooliganism in the wake of a serious riot involving German
football fans last month in France during the World Cup
tournament.
</P>
<P>
Presenting an anti-hooliganism program in Bonn Wednesday,
Kanther said that it was first of all necessary to take advance
measures to keep violent hooligans away from sports events in
order to prevent possible violence.
</P>
<P>
Measures proposed by Kanther included imposing travel
restrictions on those known hooligans on match days or, if
necessary, taking them into temporary custody to prevent them from
traveling to a sport event.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated the demand for more efficient prosecution of
those hooligans involved in violent acts.
</P>
<P>
Kanther's proposals were made in reaction to an incident that
occurred on the fringes of a World Cup match between Germany and
Yugoslavia on June 21, during which a 44-year-old French policeman
was beaten up and seriously injured by several German football
hooligans in the northern French city of Lens.
</P>
<P>
Kanther described the incident as only "the tip of an iceberg"
of sports-related violence in Germany which he said could occur
every weekend.
</P>
<P>
According to official data, the German police authorities have
registered about 2,300 hooligans across the country who used to
participate in violence during sports events.
