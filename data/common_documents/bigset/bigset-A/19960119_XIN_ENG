<HEADLINE> Ciller Assigned to Form Coalition Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkish True Path Party (DYP)
Chairwoman and caretaker Prime Minister Tansu Ciller declared here
this evening that she had been assigned by President Suleyman
Demirel to form a new coalition government.
</P>
<P>
ciller made the statement after she met with Demirel in the
presidential palace and pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) leader
Necmettin Erbakan, who failed in forming a coalition government,
returned the mandate to the president.
</P>
<P>
She said, "We will work with great self-sacrifice. A
government will be definitely formed in the parliament within the
framework of democratic practice. We are now in the situation to
embrace all the people and all the parties."
</P>
<P>
However, it seems that Ciller will find it impossible to form a
government as the Motherland Party (ANAP) is determined not to
participate in a "Mother-Path" government led by Ciller.
</P>
<P>
Ciller is not expected to change her stance. Since she is
expected to continue rejecting both a "Mother-Path" coalition led
by a person other than herself as well as the rotational prime
ministry alternative, her attempt to form a coalition government
seems destined for a failure by the end of next week.
</P>
<P>
ANAP leader Mesut Yilmaz's current maneuvering is believed to
be aimed at making the general public see that the "Mother-Path"
government cannot be formed because of Ciller's stubbornness.

<HEADLINE> Geneva Meeting on Ban of Anti-Personnel mines ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The January 15-19 session on
strengthening restrictions on the use of anti-personnel landmines
ended here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Johan Molander from Sweden, President of the session, described
the result of the meeting as "modest". But even so, "it is a step
forward", he said at a press conference this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
I was proposed at the meeting that the use of anti-personnel
mines that are not detectable be prohibited and that
anti-personnel mines be self-destructed and self-deactivated when
laid in unmarked areas.
</P>
<P>
These measures would significantly reduce the number of future
victims, he said. With the self-destruction and self-deactivation
technology, mines will be self-destroyed within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
At present, 23 countries have expressed their support for an
overall ban on the use of anti-personnel mines, according to him.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from among the 50 state parties to the 1980
Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, and from United
Nations bodies and non-governmental organizations took part in the
meeting in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The session, following the September 25-October 13 meeting last
year in Vienna, will be resumed in April here.

<HEADLINE> Norway decides To Help Tanzania: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Norway today decided to
release funds for balance of payments support to Tanzania to help
her fight the existing economic shortcomings toward a sustainable
self-reliant economy.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced by visiting Norwegian Minister for
Development cooperation Ms. Kari Nordheim Larsen after having
discussions with President Benjamin Mkapa at the State House here
this evening.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement by the State House, Larsen said her
government decided to assist Tanzania's economic recovery drive
by releasing part of the funds which had been withheld following
donors' dissatisfaction with Tanzania's conduct of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The donors decided to freeze their assistance to Tanzania in
October 1994, unhappy with her failure to collect tax revenues
and widespread tax-evasion in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The steps that you have so far taken and the oral statements
you have been issuing have given us confidence that concrete and
positive results will be forthcoming," she noted.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian minister said Norway is optimistic that the new
Tanzanian government would be able to raise the living standards
of Tanzanians step by step through the measures taken in areas of
tax collection, corruption combating, budgetary discipline and
maintenance of favorable conditions for foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
On his part, President Mkapa thanked the Norwegian government
for its decision.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said Norwegian assistance in the vastly built Tanzania's
social infrastructure such as support for higher education,
health and provision of water supply, was highly valued and
appreciated by the government and people of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Tanzania is determined to live up to the
expectations of the donor community by accomplishing the
benchmarks set by the International Monetary Fund in terms of tax
collection levels, budgetary control, plugging loopholes for
corrupt practices and maintenance of good governance.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian Minister arrived here on Thursday on a three-day
tour of Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Ferry Hijackers Surrender to Turkish Authorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Hijackers of the Black Sea ferry
Avrasya surrendered to the Turkish authorities in Istanbul without
bloodshed and released some 240 hostages they held on board for
three days, according to the official television report.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities said some seven gunmen threw their
weapons into the sea before they were arrested at around 19:00
local time (17:00 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The 3,383 ton ferry, bound for Russian port of Sochi from
Turkey's Black Sea city of Trabzon, was hijacked on Tuesday
night, the first vessel hijacked in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers, most of whom were Turkish citizens of Caucasian
origin, claimed they did so to protest Russian troops' assault on
Chechen rebels in a Dagestan village of Pervomaiskoye.
</P>
<P>
Muhammed Tokcan, head of the armed hijackers, had said they
had no quarrel with the Turkish government and people and refused to
call themselves terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The ferry arrived at the northern entrance to the Bosphorus
Strait at 12:00 local time (10:00 GMT) today and anchored near
the Asian side since the Turkish authorities had refused their
entering into the strait.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers first released some 11 hostages, believed to be
ill or young children and continued their bargaining with the
authorities on how to end the incident.
</P>
<P>
The talks were once deadlocked and the hijackers ordered the
captain to sail back where they had gone from. But an agreement
was reached later and the hijackers told television stations that
they had reached their goals and were prepared to give up.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Turkey's care-taker Prime Minister Tansu Ciller
held an emergency meeting with her high ranking aides on the
ferry hijack and reiterated her call on the hijackers to
surrender.
</P>
<P>
She said there would be no other way out for the gunmen and
giving up would be "the first and principle" step toward a peaceful
ending of the incident.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that her government was not "bargaining" with
the hijackers, but persuading them to surrender.
</P>
<P>
Ciller maintained that only a lasting peace in the Caucasus
could "put an end once and for all to such kind of incidents."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish authorities have restrained from labelling the
hijackers as "terrorists" from the very beginning since most
Turks, with historical and cultural links with the Caucasians,
sympathize with Chechens' independent drive.
</P>
<P>
Televisions reports showed that many people gathered today at
the place where the ferry anchored, shouting slogans reflecting
their support to the hijackers.
</P>
<P>
Local reports say Chechen leader Cahar Dudayev has expressed
his opposition to such hijack and ordered the gunmen to end it
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
A representative from Chechnya reportedly took part in the
negotiation with the hijackers, who once threatened to blow up
the vessel in the Bosphorus.
</P>
<P>
About 242 people were on board of the ferry, some 125 of the
passengers are from Russia and ukraine, three are from Georgia and
one from Jordan. The others are Turkish passengers and crew
members.
</P>
<P>
Only one Turkish police officer was reportedly wounded when he
exchanged fire with the hijackers when they were forcing onto the
ferry at Trabzon.
</P>
<P>
But most of the Russians and Ukrainians were shocked by the
hijacking. They were generally traders coming to Turkey to
purchase goods for sales back in Russia.
</P>
<P>
There are several million Turks of Caucasian origin living in
the country. Many of them have relatives in the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has accused Turkey of supporting Chechen separatists but
Ankara denied the claim.
</P>
<P>
However, local media have reported that Muhammed Tokcan,
leader of the hijackers, who had his fiancee killed by Russian
troops during clashes, had gone from Turkey to Chechnya
several times to fight with Dudayev's troops against the
Russians.

<HEADLINE> Somali Cereal At Half Of Pre-war Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The 1995/96 cereal output
in war-worn Somalia mounts to only half of the pre-war production
levels and hardly covers half of the consumption requirements,
"Food Situation Report" of the 7-nation intergovernmental
authority of drought and development said.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that "Somalia continues to be plagued
by insecurity with sporadic outbreaks of civil conflicts which
hamper agricultural production and lead to new population
displacements".
</P>
<P>
Food production in 1995 was also negatively affected by the
1994 bumper harvest, as farmers responded to the resulting low
maize and sorghum prices by reducing the planting area, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
Cereal output of the main season in 1995 is estimated to have
decreased by 45 percent from the 1994 bumper harvest to some
172,000 metric tons (mt), while the forthcoming secondary season
crop harvest is expected at about 100,000 mt.
</P>
<P>
The report said there is a food deficit of 386,000 mt, about half
of which may be covered by commercial imports, leaving a food aid
import to be around 216,000 mt.

<HEADLINE> Bildt Says Reconstruction Key to Durable Peace in Bosnia  (By Jiang Yaping) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sarajevo, January 19 (Xinhua) -- High Representative for
reconstruction mission in Bosnia Carl Bildt said here today that
economic development and reconstruction "is key to a durable peace
in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"We need to give people in Bosnia a viable future and make
their life better," he said.
</P>
<P>
To this end,"jobs must be created for Bosnian soldiers as they
are demobilized and there is a strong need for macro-economic
framework within Bosnia and for free trade with its neighbors to
promote economic growth," Bildt told Xinhua at his office in an
exclusive interview.
</P>
<P>
The High Representative, who is coordinating the overall
civilian peace effort, has threatened to suspend financial aid to
both parties if internal trade and economic cooperation were not
realized.
</P>
<P>
Economic reconstruction is a formidable challenge for the
war-ruined country after nearly four pears of bloody war. The
economic life is almost halted.
</P>
<P>
The former co-chairman of international conference on the
former Yugoslavia said the world bank was establishing itself in
Sarajevo and has an important role on the basis of the good work
it has already done on urgent reconstruction priorities.
</P>
<P>
To activate the reconstruction work, "I shall be coordinating
the work of the many agencies to ensure the best use of the
funding provided by the international community," the chief
civilian administrator said.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the rebuilding work, the 47-year-old High
Representative, who was appointed to the current post after the
peace agreement was initialed in Dayton, said a lot of work has
been done and half of the 540 million u.s. dollars for the initial
start of the reconstruction has already been promised.
</P>
<P>
"We are proceeding well. We are on the half way and the
indications so far are good although many difficulties are still
ahead."
</P>
<P>
The former Swedish prime minister also mentioned the followup
donors conference in March which he thinks is very important as
the governments of donor countries have time to evaluate their
strategies.
</P>
<P>
At the first donation conference on December 20, 1995, in
Brussels, 540 million dollars had been pledged in Bosnia. World
Bank assessment put the amount of money needed for reconstruction
in the next three or four years at five billion u.s. dollars.
</P>
<P>
When asked about his current priority in the broader sense, he
summed up in one word: reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
"Reconciliation between the parties would make all the other
things much easier--economic reconstruction, security, human
rights questions, the building of a political structure in new
Bosnia, and so on."

<HEADLINE> Apple Computer Set for Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Apple Computer Inc., one of
the leading computer makers in the World, has put itself up for
sale, but cannot find potential buyers, the Wall Street Journal
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Discussions between Apple and Sun Microsystems Inc., a big
maker of workstations, broke off earlier this month because of a
dispute over a price, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Apple also recently solicited a bid from Hewlett-Packard Co.,
among others. In October, the company expressed interest in
rekindling talks with International Business Machines Corp., (IBM)
which in 1994 had offered to buy Apple but it disagreed on price,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, Apple encountered no active response this
time.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Apple reported a 69 million U.S. dollar loss
for the last quarter of 1995 and announced a restructuring that
would narrow its product focus and cut 1,300 of the company's
14,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Apple stock fell 6 percent Thursday and tumbled further today.
</P>
<P>
The company is ranked as the world's second-largest personal
computer maker with about a 10 percent market share. Apple faces
trouble mainly because all other major PC makers use a different
design: the so-called "IBM-compatible" format based on Intel Corp.
chips and Microsoft Corp. operating software.
</P>
<P>
Apple has to bear the entire design and marketing burden for
its products, making it difficult to stay competitive on market.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Concerns With New Influx Of Burundi Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(By Pei Shanqin)
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has expressed concern over the new influx of Burundi refugees
escaping from danger of ethnic fighting in their home country.
</P>
<P>
The Minister for Home Affairs, Ali Ameir Mohammed, told a
press conference this afternoon that the Tanzanian government
would allow more Burundi refugees to enter the country,
although Tanzania is bound to its obligation on the voluntary
repatriation of refugees.
</P>
<P>
"We are very much concerned with the new influx following the
new wave of fighting in Burundi, but we insist that we would like
to see all refugees, including those from Rwanda and Burundi,
return to their country as soon as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Over 10,000 Burundi refugees are reported to have fled into
Tanzania from a United Nations camp, which is sixty kilmetres
from the Tanzanian border.
</P>
<P>
Since the assasination of democratically elected president
Melchior Ndadaye in October 1993, Burundi has been plunged into
civil strife between the minority Tutsi led army and Hutu
militants.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has been a host country for over 300,000 Burundi
refugees, who have been concentrated in Kigoma and Kagera
regions.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian minister called on the internaional community to
help bring about a lasting peace in Burundi for the refugees to
return voluntarily and safely.
</P>
<P>
"The burden of caring for a large number of refugees cannot be
tolerated any more by Tanzania and we call on the Burundi
government to work hand in hand with us in the creation of
favourable environment for the return of refugees," the
minister added.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Tanzanian Minister for Defence and
National Service, Edgar Maokola Majogo, is to leave Dar es Salaam
tomorrow for a three-day tour of Kagera and Kigoma regions to
assess the situation along the border with Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The defence minister is to be accompanied by the chief of
defence forces, General Robert Mboma, and other senior military
officers.

HARARE, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A top ranking Israeli official
today called for increased trade and investment between Israel
and Zimbabwe, saying the former is willing to play its part in
developing zimbabwe's economy.
</P>

countries such as Zimbabwe," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that Israel was renowned for its sophisticated
irrigation and water management technology, which Zimbabwe could
use as it was prone to recurrent droughts.

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Start Peace Talks with Buthelezi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 19 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
said today he would initiate a round of urgent peace talks with
political leaders in Kwazulu/Natal to bring the unabating
violence in the province to an end.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a three-hour meeting with Zulu
King Goodwill Zwelithini at the king's Kwakhangela palace near
Nongoma, Mandela said a scheduled gathering of the Zulu nation
(Imbizo), authorized by Zwelithini, would hopefully reconcile
rival political parties in the province.
</P>
<P>
The Imbizo would be preceded by a meeting of Inkatha Freedom
Party (ifp) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and African National
Congress (anc) provincial leader Jacob Zuma on Saturday to
discuss plans for the long-awaited Imbizo, which was aimed at
stamping out violence in Kwazulu/Natal.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very important and significant development," said
the president, adding all the problems concerning the killings in
the province would be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Mandela stressed that political violence was turning
Kwazulu/Natal into a "ghost province" and continued to humiliate
the Zulu nation.
</P>
<P>
The Imbizo, expected to be a highly politicized event, would
also be an all-inclusive gathering, he added.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming Imbizo was first proposed by Zwelithini during
a meeting with Mandela in 1994, and subsequently supported by
Buthelezi.
</P>
<P>
However, Buthelezi later called his own Imbizo in Durban late
last year in a move that angered the king and strained relations
between the two Zulu leaders.
</P>
<P>
Ifp supporters also accused the king of becoming increasingly
anc-aligned.
</P>
<P>
Zwelithini said the royal council supported the Imbizo, but
further meetings were required before a final announcement could
be made.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be pushed to call in Imbizo where i don't
know what i'm going to say," said the king.
</P>
<P>
However, Zwelithini rejected claims that the royal house had
become politically aligned, saying he knew he was lined out with
some political parties.
</P>
<P>
"I am the king of everybody in this province," he added.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the political violence between the anc and
ifp supporters in Kwazulu/Natal had claimed the lives of
thousands of people in the province in the past two years.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Grain Production Declines in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea harvested only
142,000 tons of cereal in 1995, a 50 percent decrease than the
1994 bumper figure.
</P>
<P>
This was reported here by a food situation report of the
7-nation Intergovernmental Authority of Drought and Development.
</P>
<P>
The report said Eritrea food production is dependent on highly
unreliable rainfall, as the crop growing areas are located in the
northern fringes of the inter-tropical rain-belt.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 rainy season started late and rainfall was not well
distributed over the growing season, it said, adding that the
area planted to crops was less than average by four percent, and
production was affected by insect pests, particularly
grasshoppers and desert locusts.
</P>
<P>
the report pointed out that following the poor harvest and
exceptionally low food stocks, the food situation in Eritrea is
tight.
</P>
<P>
It estimated that commercial cereal imports in 1996 may not
exceed 100,000 tons, leaving a food aid import requirement of
192,000 tons of which 78,000 tons would be for emergency relief
food assistance for over 700,000 vulnerable people.

30 artworks from Kenya for international competition in New York
during the 3rd Session of the Preparatory Committee Meeting of
the Habitat II next month.
</P>
<P>
Ng'eno said he is impressed by the children's concept of human
settlements as was demonstrated in the exhibition and called upon
all concerned to support children in developing their artistic
skills.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Increases Cereal Production By 15 Percent In 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's cereal
production in 1995 increased by 15 percent over that in 1994, a
food situation report published by the 7-nation
Inter-Governmental Authority of Drought and Development said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a crop assessment mission from the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Food Program (WFP)
as estimating that Ethiopia's 1995/96 cereal harvest is at 8.7
million metric tons (mt).
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is the largest grain producer in the sub-region
contributing over 40 percent of the region's total annual cereal
output. It is also the region's most populous country with over
50 million people.
</P>
<P>
The report said, average cereal production of about 6.9
million mt can hardly cover consumption requirements in the
country and about one million mt of cereal imports are required
each year to meet the structural food deficit.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that "for the first time in many years,
Ethiopia's domestic cereal supply is able to cover domestic
requirements and food imports may not be necessary during the
January-December 1996 marketing year+.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said, two food security challenges that
Ethiopia has to grapple with are the sustenance of the attained
food production levels and ensuring long-term access to food by
some three million vulnerable people currently in need of relief
food. enditem

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Begins Negotiations With Liberian Faction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping
force in Liberia, known as ECOMOG, has begun negotiations with
the Liberian armed faction, ULIMO-J, after the Liberian faction
attacked and killed some peacekeepers earlier, the Nigerian defense
spokesman has said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria on Thursday,
Director of Defense Information Fred Chijuka said that the
hostilities, erupted after the faction of Roosevelt Johnson-led
ULIMO attacked ECOMOG near the town of Tubmanburg, have subsided
now.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman noted that there are indications
that the Johnson faction is taking on the Alhaji Kromah-led ULIMO
(the United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia).
</P>
<P>
Johnson used to be the commander of the ULIMO fighters while
Alhaji Kromah was the political leader of ULIMO.
</P>
<P>
The internal wranglings in ULIMO, a liberation movement
launched in 1991 by exiled Liberians to counter Liberia's major
armed faction, the National Patriotic Front of Liberia led by
Charles Taylor, blew open in 1993 when the two leaders parted
ways.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Reassures Mining Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba today reiterated his government's commitment to privatize
the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), the backbone of the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said ZCCM represents the state's largest investment
and the selling of such an enterprise will therefore take into
account the interests of the mining industry and the nation.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the fifth session of the seventh national assembly
here, Chiluba revealed that the necessary studies for the
privatization of ZCCM have been completed and the government is
currently negotiating with interested parties the pertinent steps
to follow before the mining conglomerate can be sold.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has also engaged the services of legal
consultants and a merchant bank to work out the modalities on the
sale of ZCCM.
</P>
<P>
The main aspect of selling ZCCM is the development of the
Konkola deep mine to its fullest potential, which will cost some
600 million US dollars, he explained.
</P>
<P>
The president told the national assembly that the government
is taking various measures to stop further decline in ZCCM's
production.
</P>
<P>
The government has 73 percent of shares in the mining conglomerate
whose exports account for 90 percent of the country's foreign
exchange earnings.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Welfare Party Leader Returns Mandate for Coalition to President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP)
leader Necmettin Erbakan returned the mandate to President
Suleyman Demirel for the formation of a new coalition government
as Erbakan failed in forming the government, a statement from the
press office of the presidential palace declared this evening.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Erbakan, who was assigned by demirel on
January 9 to form a coalition government, held an hour-long talk
with the president and returned the mandate to Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan did not succeed in his talks with other four political
parties' leaders to seek partnership for the coalition.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Motherland Party (ANAP) Chairman Mesut Yilmaz met
with Erbakan, their second meeting since Erbakan received the
mandate to form a government from Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, Yilmaz told reporters that there was no
way he could give a positive reply to the RP leader without first
assessing other alternatives.
</P>
<P>
It is still unclear whether a proposed "Motherpath" government
-- a coalition between the ANAP and the True Path Party led by
caretaker Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, will be formed, because
ANAP has said explicitly and repeatedly that it will not
participate in a government led by Ciller.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan has already announced that he would not agree to
become partners with the True Path Party (DYP) because that would
not be "elegant." In fact that is a farfetched idea because the
DYP leader has repeatedly declared that she would not even propose
a DYP-RP coalition.
</P>
<P>
Since ANAP is determined not to take part in a governmetn led
by Ciller, it seems that Ciller will find it very difficult to
form a new coalition.

ANKARA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish caretaker Prime

Ciller made this remark after meeting with Demirel at the

Earlier today, Turkish reliable sources told Xinhua that it was

government.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Favors Appointment of High Ranking European Coordinator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government would
back the appointment of a European Union (EU) coordinator on
Cyprus of the highest possible standing, government spokesman
Yannakis Cassoulides said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, Cassoulides said that
the 15 EU member states are carrying on consultations on the role
Europe could play in efforts to settle the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
"Greece can certainly play a substantive role in this
process. It is only reasonable that the Greek government would
consult with the Cyprus government on the position Greece will
adopt on the matter within the EU," he remarked.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides also noted that Italian Foreign Minister Susanna
Agnelli, who chairs the EU Council of Ministers, had said an EU
coordinator is expected to be appointed.
</P>
<P>
According to Agnelli, the EU coordinator would be involved in
efforts to solve the Cyprus problem, strengthen U.S. efforts in
this direction to boost the U.N. chief's good offices mission in
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The year 1995 witnessed a stalemate in the peace talks between
the two communities -- the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots
-- on the island. Since the beginning of the new year, the
U.N. and the international community have stepped up their peace
efforts to bring the two communities' leaders to a direct
negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
Referring to reports about replacement of U.N. special
representative on Cyprus Joe Clark, the spokesman said he did not
know anything about it.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish News Agency Anatolia reported that former
Norwegian Foreign Minister Thorvald Stoltenberg will probably be
the new U.N. special envoy for Cyprus, to replace outgoing
Canadian Joe Clark.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot daily Kibris also noted that the former
Norwegian foreign minister is the most likely replacement for Joe
Clark because his country is not an EU member.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President On Importance Of Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 19 (Xinhua)-- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba today stressed that agriculture is a focal point of the
country's development not only from the point of view of ensuring
the nation's food security but also promoting agro-based
industry.
</P>
<P>
President Chiluba made the remarks at the opening of fifth
session of the seventh National Assembly in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said the improvement in the agricultural sector will
have several beneficial effects as it creates jobs with modest
levels of investment.
</P>
<P>
" Agriculture, given the climatic and soil conditions of
Zambia, is very meaningful way of diversifying our export
earnings," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
" As a good example in this regard has been provided by the
horticultural sub-sector which raised its exports from 12 million
U.S. Dollars in 1994 to 20 million dollars last year," he added.
</P>
<P>
Therefore the government has injected a total of 20.7 million
U.S. Dollars into the agricultural sector investment program as a
prelude to donor funding, he said.
</P>
<P>
As another measure to boost the farming, the government has
also forgiven more than 210 small farmers their debts totalling
29.7 million dollars they owed to the lending institutins, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The government launched the agriculture sector investment
program late last year to resuscitate the country's agriculrual
sector ravaged by a successive drought in the past years.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Says Separation of Fighting Forces in Bosnia  Fulfilled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A month after the transfer of
authority from the UN Peacekeeping Forces to the NATO-led
multinational peace Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia, IFOR's
task to separate the fighting forces has been fulfilled, NATO
Secretary General Javier Solana said here today.
</P>
<P>
Solana said that he is very satisfied with the smooth
deployment of the IFOR troops.
</P>
<P>
The secretary general pointed out that NATO's operation in
Bosnia-Herzegovina is a "concrete contribution to build a new and
secure Europe," adding that IFOR's basic mission there is to
provide a "secure environment" for reconstruction in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, Solana expressed NATO's concern over the Croat-Muslim
disputes in the city of Mostar.
</P>
<P>
"We will put all the pressure we can on the two sides to unify
the city," he told a joint press conference.
</P>
<P>
At the joint press conference, General George Joulwan, NATO's
Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, said 34 countries have so far
participated in IFOR and more than half of the 60,000 troops have
been already deployed in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
He said the deployment will hopefully be completed by
mid-February, 45 days after the beginning of the operation.
</P>
<P>
He said IFOR would do everything within its mandate to react
quickly to any terrorist attack, but not do the work of an
international police force.

<P>
BRUSSELS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Vice-President of the European
Commission (EC), Manuel Marin said today that the European Union
"fully supports" the Palestinian elections to be held tomorrow and
the peace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference today, Marin called the elections a
"historical event" which will give a new impetus to the peace
process in the Middle East and contribute to the consolidation of
the Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Israeli-PLO Interim Agreement, signed in
Washington on September 28, 1995, invited the EU not only to
supply observers to, but also to coordinate the whole of the
international observation of Palestinian elections.
</P>
<P>
According to the EC Vice President, the EU has established a
35-strong Electoral Unit, headed by former Swedish Minister of
Justice, Carl Lidbom.
</P>
<P>
The Electoral Unit is responsible for the management and
monitoring of some 300 EU observers as well as of coordinating the
activities of other international observer delegations.
</P>
<P>
Marin announced that, on the occasion of the elections of the
Palestinian Council and the President of the Palestinian National
Authority, he will visit the West Bank and Gaza Strip from 20 to
22 this month.
</P>
<P>
He said the Troika composed of the Foreign Affairs Ministers of
Spain, Italy and Ireland, as well as he himself will participate
in the provisional announcement of the elections' results.

<HEADLINE> Power Workers Abducted in Grozny Alive: Itar-Tass </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The 29 Russian power workers who
were abducted in the Chechen capital of Grozny on Tuesday are
alive, the Itar-Tass news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The unidentified abductors have not made any demands, the
news service said.
</P>
<P>
The workers from Rostov and Volgodonsk, who had been working to
restore power in Grozny, were driven away in a bus by several
masked, armed men.
</P>
<P>
Some newspapers said that the workers are being held by Chechen
rebels in the village of Yermolovka.
</P>
<P>
But according to the press center of the Chechen Interior
Ministry, there are no Russian workers in the village which is
fully controlled by the pro-Moscow Chechen government.
</P>
<P>
The hijacking took place when the Russian forces stormed the
Dagestani village of Pervomaiskoye where Chechen militants were
holding more than 100 hostages after raiding Kizlyar last week.

<HEADLINE> Former Chechen FM Hopes for Peaceful Solution of Ferry  Hijacking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 19 (Xinhua)-- Former Chechen Foreign Minister
Shamseddin Yusef said today in Istanbul he hoped the hijacking of
the Turkish ferry boat by Chechen separatists would be solved
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Turkish television channel ATV, Yusef
said that the Chechen National Revival Government did not instruct
the pro-Chechen rebels to hijack the "Avrasia" ferry at the
Turkish port city of Trabzon on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ferry boat, heading for the Russian port of Sochi, was
seized by nine Chechen militants who demanded the Russian
commandos stop the storming of Chechen guerrillas in the Dagestani
village of Pervomaiskoye. The Russian government announced on
Thursday that Russian troops had wiped out the chechen rebels in
the village.
</P>
<P>
The hijacked ferry, with 120 passengers and 45 crew on board,
is moored at Anadolu Feneri near the mouth of the Bosporus Strait.
</P>
<P>
Yusef, who along with the rest of the Russian-backed Chechen
cabinet resigned on January 10, said that "it is a shame" to
hijack the ferry boat.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the incident would be resolved without fighting
or bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
Turkish caretaker Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said Thursday
that for the security of Istanbul, the Turkish government will not
allow the hijacked ferry, packed with explosives, to go through
the Bosporus Strait, a busy shipping route.

<HEADLINE> Eurofighter Program to Go Ahead as Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The program to build 230
Eurofighter aircraft for the Royal Air Force is set to begin this
summer after Britain and Germany settled a year-long wrangle over
the manufacturing work share, it was reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough came after Volke Ruhe, German Defense
Minister, announced that Germany would buy an additional 40
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting in London yesterday, officials of the two
countries agreed that the increase in German purchases could form
the basis for an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Under an outline deal, Britain's share of the 46 billion U.S.
dollars production work will rise to 37 or 38 percent, while
Germany's will shrink to 30 percent. The remainder will go to the
two other partners, Italy and Spain.
</P>
<P>
This means that British industry, including most companies
involved in aerospace, will earn about 16 billion U.S. dollars --
1.6 billion more than previously expected -- from work on the
aircraft, with British Aerospace being the biggest beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
The high-agility aircraft, which is expected to outperform
every fighter in the world except the American F22 now under
development, is expected to enter squadron service in 2002,
replacing the RAF's air defense Tornados.

<HEADLINE> US Unemployment Rate Remains Unchanged in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. unemployment rate
remained unchanged in December at 5.6 percent, the Labor
Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said 7.38 million Americans were out of work and
looking for jobs in December. About 4.4 million people were
working part time but preferred full-time work.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate was lowest for 1995 in February at 5.4 percent
and highest rate in April at 5.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
A separate survey said that 151,000 jobs were created outside
the farm sector last month.
</P>
<P>
The strength in the labor market came in manufacturing, where
employment rose by 52,000. But the number was inflated by a gain
of 31,000 returning aerospace workers who had been on strike
against the Boeing Co.
</P>
<P>
The retail industry, which has been hard hit by lackluster
sales during the all-important Christmas season, experienced a
drop of 48,000 jobs last month.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. businesses added 1.7 million workers to their payrolls
in 1995, down sharply from the 3.53 million jobs that added in
1994.
</P>
<P>
Today's report confirms other data that show the U.S. economy
is still growing modestly.

<HEADLINE> Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant Completes Plan for 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The two generation units of
the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant completed the annual plan by
channeling more than ten billion kwh of electricity into the
electricity grid last year, a spokesman for the Guangdong Nuclear
Power Joint Venture Co. Ltd announced today.
</P>
<P>
The power plant has strictly abided by the safety regulations
of both China and the International Atomic Energy Organization,
and no radiation accidents have occured, the company spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from seven radio-activity monitoring stations which
are within ten km of the power plant show that the ecological
environment there is normal.
</P>
<P>
The two-generation units went through first fuel change last
year. The No.1 generation unit channeled 3.7 billion kwh of
electricity into the electricity grid, registering an effective
power rate of 48.4 percent. The No.2 generation unit channeled 6.3
billion kwh into the grid, registering an effective power rate of
82.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Since it was put into operation two years ago, the power plant
generated a combined output value of over 700 million US
dollars. The construction of the plant cost four billion US
dollars. It was China's first nuclear power plant built with
foreign investment.

<HEADLINE> SDP Changes Its Japanese Name, Party Platform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Japan's main partner in the
three-party ruling coalition, the Social Democratic Party (SDP),
today changed its Japanese name and adopted a new party platform
in a bid to form a new political force.
</P>
<P>
At its 64th party convention, the SDP changed the name it has
held since its inception 50 years ago "Nippon Shakaito (Japan
Socialist Party)" to "Shakai Minshuto (Social Democratic Party)".
Though it changed its English name to Social Democratic Party in
1991, the party continued to use its Japanese name.
</P>
<P>
On January 16, former Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama was
reelected as the chairman of the party.
</P>
<P>
The change paved the way for a merger with the smallest partner
in the coalition government, Sakigake (New Party).
</P>
<P>
"We must begin to aim at establishing another party that can
take power with the partnership of New Party Sakigake, which
shares the same purpose," Murayama was quoted as telling the
convention.
</P>
<P>
The new party platform adopted at the one-day convention
describes the SDP as a "common home" for democratism and a party
which appeals to democrats and liberals.
</P>
<P>
It urges the building of a society where human dignity,
righteousness and fairness are respected and individualism and
collectivism are harmonized through freedom and democratism.
</P>
<P>
It says the SDP protects the ideals of the Constitution while
it regrets and apologizes for Japan's colonial rule and aggression
before and during World War Two.
</P>
<P>
It also says the party aims at creating politics led by "big
local governments and a small central government."
</P>
<P>
The SDP had previously planned to disband itself and launch a
new "liberal" party at the convention but postponed the plan at
Murayama's request.
</P>
<P>
The SDP was formed in late 1945.

<HEADLINE> China Turns Out 94 Million Tons of Steel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- China has grown to become one
of the world's major steel producers, with an expected steel
output of 94 million tons in 1995, up 1.39 million tons over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the Ministry of the Metallurgical Industry said that
China witnessed a rapid expansion in the industry during the
Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995) period, during which steel
output enjoyed an annual increase rate of 7.5 percent on the
average.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the country turned out 101 million tons
of pig iron, 80 million tons of rolled steel and 248 million
tons of iron ore last year.
</P>
<P>
With the steady growth of steel output, China is able to
produce more and better steel products, such as galvanized steel
sheet, tin plate, cold-rolled silicon steel sheet and oil pipes.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, standard coal consumption for producing each
ton of steel was reduced from 1.61 tons in 1990 to 1.52 tons in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years China has exported 13.4 million tons
of rolled steel, 5.31 million tons of steel billet, 8.22
million tons of pig iron and 4.45 million tons of iron alloy.
</P>
<P>
China exported metallurgical products worth more than five
billion US dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Between 1991 and 1995 China invested 15.6 billion yuan (about
1.88 billion US dollars) in infrastructure and technological
improvement in the industry.

<HEADLINE> "Buddhist City" to Emerge in Nanjing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A "Buddhist city" is expected
to be built in this capital of east China's Jiangsu Province over
the next 10 years, sources with the local government said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The city will cover an area of some 10 sq km and contain
building structures in typical Buddhist style, as well as Buddhist
sculptures and paintings. It will be enclosed by high walls.
</P>
<P>
This will be the second of its kind in China. The other is
located in Sanya City on Hainan Island. It features Buddhist
temples, schools and research institutes.
</P>
<P>
Sanya will also erect a big Buddhist statue near the city,
which is designed to be higher than the Statue of Liberty in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The two Buddhist cities are designed by leading architects,
historians and artists who got their aspiration from ancient
religious structures.
</P>
<P>
Buddhism found its way into China nearly 2,000 years ago and
since then numerous believers have built thousands of temples and
pagodas throughout the country. These sites have become major
tourism attractions.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the two Buddhist cities will help spur local
construction of highways, hotels, etc., sources said.
</P>
<P>
Both of them will involve large investments; the one in Nanjing
will possibly draw some 100 million US dollars of investment from
a Hong Kong company.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Briefs CIS Summit on Storm Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 19 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin told
CIS leaders today there was no other choice but to wipe out the
Chechen militants holed up in a southern Russian village with some
100 hostages.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the opening of the Commonwealth of Independent
States summit in the Kremlin, he described the Russian forces'
storm operation against Chechen militants as "a tragedy."
</P>
<P>
He told leaders of the former Soviet republics how the federal
forces wiped out the Chechen militants and freed hostages, first
in Kizlyar and then at Pervomaiskoye, both in the southern Russian
autonomous region of Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, this is a tragedy," he said. "Many civilians and
servicemen have lost their lives. We grieve for them but we had no
other choice."
</P>
<P>
The president told the summit that 350 Chechen militants
headed by Salman Raduyev raided Kizlyar and took more than 3,000
people hostage.
</P>
<P>
The militants then retreated to Pervomaiskoye taking 110 to 120
hostages with them as a human shield. Yeltsin said the figure was
based on the estimates of freed hostages.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that 29 Chechen militants were killed in Kizlyar
while 24 civilians and 9 servicemen lost their lives in the city.
</P>
<P>
In Pervomaiskoye, 153 Chechens were killed and 30 were captured
while the Russian forces lost 26 men. "All the villagers of
Pervomaiskoye are still alive," the president stressed.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that the Chechen militants tried on Wednesday and
Thursday to break through a ring of Russian troops surrounding the
village by hiding behind the hostages, mostly women and
local policemen. But he did not say whether the militants had
escaped or not.
</P>
<P>
However, according to a well-informed official source, some 100
Chechen militants including their chief Raduyev managed to break
through the ring.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the Procurator-General's office is
investigating who in Kizlyar was responsible for failing to
protect the civilians from terrorist acts.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Looks Forward to Palestinian Elections with Great Interest: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said Egypt is looking forward with great interest to the
first Palestinian elections to take place Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the state-run Middle East News Agency
issued today, Moussa said that the Palestinian Council elections
will lead to initiating talks in May on the final stage of the
Palestinian-Israeli peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
He added that the negotiations will cover several essential
issues, atop of which is the Palestinians' right for
self-determination and the establishment of a state of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian foreign minister said that for the first time the
Palestinians will be voting on the establishment of the 88-member
legislative assembly -- the Palestinian Council.
</P>
<P>
Moussa expressed hope that the voting will take place in a good
atmosphere to make the Palestinians proud of this historical day
and to allow the Israelis to consider this day as a true step
toward the emergence of a neighboring entity, namely Palestine, and
the realization of a real comprehensive peace in the region.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Calls for Economic Integration at CIS Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia will strive to strengthen
economic ties between the members of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) but will not force integration on them,
Russian President Boris Yeltsin said at the 17th CIS summit which
opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Enhanced economic, cultural and scientific relations between
Russia and other CIS nations is vital to Russia's "strategy",
but members would be free to choose whether or not they wanted
integration, Yeltsin was quoted as saying by the Itar-Tass agency.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president, unanimously reelected chairman of the
CIS leadership council at the beginning of the summit, said
integration could be achieved "while preserving the sovereignty and
independence" of states, and that does not mean a "return to
the past."
</P>
<P>
He denounced those who accused Russia of "imperial behavior."
</P>
<P>
"We know who they are, ... They are trying to sow seeds of
mistrust in Russia and in one another. I hope we will show
sufficient wisdom to live together in friendship and be respected
in the world," said Yeltsin, who has been head of the council
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The economy and security are the main topics on the summit
agenda. The heads of the 12 former Soviet republics attending the
summit are due to discuss the gradual introduction of an economic
union between states, including the setting-up of a tariff union
and a payment union.
</P>
<P>
The proposal of a payment union is aimed at curing the running
sore of the other republics' rising debts to Russia. In
the first 10 months of 1995 alone, Russia provided 15 trillion
Russia Rubles (3.2 billion U.S. dollars) worth of fuel to CIS
states for nothing, the CIS statistics committee reported.
</P>
<P>
The tariff union, which comprises Russia, Belarus and
Kazakhstan, will take in Kirghizstan as its fourth member at
the end of this year. Uzbekistan and Tadzhikistan have applied for
membership.
</P>
<P>
Other subjects on the agenda include regional conflicts in
Tajik-Afghan borders and the secessionist Abkhazia region in the
Georgian Republic, the overall security of the CIS, and the battle
against terrorism and crime.

<HEADLINE> More Food, Medicine Sent to Hostages in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Upon request of kidnappers
belonging to the Organisasi Papu Merdeka (OPM) in Irian Jaya, some
393 kilograms of food and medicine as well as two church leaders
have arrived at Mapunduma village today.
</P>
<P>
When the food and medicine were sent to Mapunduma, the area
around the village was closed to other aircraft, according to an
Antara report today from Wamena.
</P>
<P>
An Antara report quoted a reliable source from the military
regional command in Wamena as saying that the Indonesian Armed
Forces (ABRI) has been told not take action in any form, including
a military operation.
</P>
<P>
All ABRI forces near Mapunduma village were instructed not to
take action which could jeopardize the safe release of the
hostages.
</P>
<P>
The OPM kidnappers on January 8 abducted 24 people as hostages
including seven foreigners. Nine were released later and one
foreigner was temporarily sent out by the kidnappers as a mediator
on the condition that he must return back.
</P>
<P>
The ABRI has set up a command post in the town of Wamena about
160 kilometers or half an hour flight from Mapunduma.
</P>
<P>
The military has virtually ruled out using force to free the
hostages, saying that it was still using persuasion to guarantee
the safety of the hostages, and ultimately secure their release.
</P>
<P>
The OPM had not made any ransom demands, but a source close to
the negotiations said they are calling for the recognition of a
separate state in Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
The military and the OPM continued their contacts by radio
which could be monitored by local people in the area.
</P>
<P>
The hostage issue has already aroused concern of the UN
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali who was quoted by his
spokesman on Thursday as saying that he is calling for the
immediate release of hostages in Irian Jaya.

<HEADLINE> China's Non-Governmental Cultural Exchanges Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Non-governmental cultural
exchanges have become the mainstream of China's cultural exchange
work with foreign countries, according to an official with China's
Ministry of Culture.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that in 1995 over 90 percent of Chinese
performances and exhibitions in foreign countries were
non-governmental, and the same was also true with foreign
presentations and exhibitions in China.
</P>
<P>
As a part of non-governmental cultural exchanges, performances
on business terms also reaped satisfactory fruits last year, when
China dispatched 64 art groups with a total of 1,155 artists to
perform abroad, according to Sun Weixue, director of the
Department for Cultural Exchanges with Foreign Countries of the
Ministry of Culture.
</P>
<P>
"Commercial performances can not only demonstrate China's
colorful culture to the outside world but also serve as a cultural
exchange form which combines social interests with economic
interests," Sun said, adding that such performances would be
further encouraged.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, governmental cultural exchanges also witnessed
improvement last year when Chinese governmental cultural
delegations visited over 20 countries in Asia, Africa, Latin
America and Europe, and more than 20 similar foreign delegations
toured China.
</P>
<P>
Besides, China reached cultural agreements with Macedonia and
signed implementation plans with 25 countries based on cultural
agreements in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Also last year some 200 Chinese artists took part in
international competitions in the fields of acrobatics, ballet and
music, winning a dozen medals.
</P>
<P>
"China has also been successful in introducing foreign cultural
attainments," said Sun. He noted that in the previous year the
Chinese appreciated not only the presentations of some
world-famous dance and musical groups but also painting
exhibitions by acclaimed artists.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the Chinese government will take more active
steps this year to stimulate the country's cultural exchanges with
foreign countries.

<P>
PARIS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Saturday's Palestinian elections
represent a major step in the Middle East peace process, Egyptian
President Muhammed Hosni Mubarak said in an interview with the le
Figaro newspaper, which was published here today.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said the peace process should continue in a
comparatively relaxed atmosphere, which will help discussions on
the difficult and sensitive issue of the status of Jerusalem and
other areas of the Holy Land, according to the French newspaper.
</P>
<P>
He said the problem of the status of the Holy Land is very
important not only for Arabs but for all Moslems and he urged
people to be on the alert against Islamic extremists.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said the extremists, who use religion as a guise to
carry on their acts of violence, have a political agenda and are
distorting Islam.
</P>
<P>
Islam advocates peace, kindness and cooperation, not bloodshed
and hatred, and should not constitute threat to anybody, he said.

<HEADLINE> Senior Officer Calls for More PLA Self-Sufficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A senior military officer today
called for better agricultural and sideline production by the
country's armed forces to improve their self-sufficiency, cohesive
force and combat effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ke, director of the General Logistics Department of the
People's Liberation Army (PLA), made the appeal at a conference to
promote agricultural and sideline production among the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
The production helps relieve the burden on the state and raises
the living standard in the army, the director said, calling on
military officers to have an appropriate understanding of the
necessity and significance of this production.
</P>
<P>
Wang set the target that 80 percent of company-level units of
the armed forces should be able to produce themselves 70 percent
of the meat and vegetables they need in the coming three years.
</P>
<P>
He urged logistics officers at various levels to acquire more
knowledge of science and technology to manage the production well
and improve the living standards of the army.
</P>
<P>
With directions from the Central Military Commission and the
General Logistics Department over several years, China's armed
forces have been making great efforts to boost agricultural and
sideline production.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the PLA turned out 660,000 million tons of food
grains, together with large amounts of meat, fish, eggs and
vegetables. Its total income was a 20 percent rise over the
previous year.

</P>
<P>

<P>
At a joint press conference held at the end of the meeting, the
Cypriot official described the talks as "constructive."

negotiations between the Lebanese and the Israelis, hoping an
early resumption of the Lebanese-Israeli peace talks in order to
realize a comprehensive peace in the region.

which Cyprus and Lebanon could play in the present stage, and what

And the talks also dealt with the relations between the
Mediterranean countries and Europe, and the latest developments in
the Middle East peace process, Boueiz added.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on an Israeli request to integrate the
Israel-backed South Lebanon Army militia into the Lebanon Army,
the Lebanese Foreign Minister stressed that this problem is a
"interior affair" and does not concern Israel and the Lebanese
government will treat this problem on its own.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Visits Coal Research Institute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The workers and scientific
researchers in the coal industry have made great contributions to
energy construction and national economic development, Chinese
President Jiang Zemin said here today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC)
Central Committee, extended Spring Festival's greetings to the
workers and scientific researchers in the sector when inspecting
the coal slurry and coal liquefying workshop of the Ministry of
the Coal Industry this morning.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Coal Minister Wang Senhao, Jiang Zemin,
Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo, also a member of the Politburo of the CPC
Central Committee, and Zeng Qinghong, director of the General
Office of the CPC Central Committee, visited a research institute
under the ministry which does research into coal slurry and coal
liquefying techniques.
</P>
<P>
China is rich in coal resources. Chinese researchers have
worked out coal slurry and coal liquefying techniques since the
1980s. Coal slurry, consisting of 70 percent coal, 30 percent
water and one percent additives, can be used in industrial boilers
in place of heavy oil under proper conditions. And the coal
liquefying technique is used to change coal into clean and
convenient liquid fuel or chemical raw materials under high
temperature and pressure.
</P>
<P>
Jiang praised scientific workers for their efforts to improve
coal technology and pointed out that coal is China's main energy
resource. He expressed the hope that the ministry would strengthen
the work on coal slurry and liquefying techniques, and that the
State Council and departments concerned under it would pay more
attention and give more support to the work.
</P>
<P>
He also asked officials at all levels in the industry to care
more about the livelihood of the workers, beef up safety work,
improve productivity by relying on science and deepen the
reform to advance the modernization drive of the industry.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Filipino Businessmen Bullish About Economy (by Xiong Changyi) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine business
community continues to be optimistic about the country's economic
prospects.
</P>
<P>
In a survey conducted by the Makati Business Club, 70.9 percent
of the respondents believed that "economic expansion will be
higher in 1996 than the six percent growth in 1995."
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said today that the
economic expansion in 1996 will come from increased investments
and higher exports and imports during the year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the turmoil in the financial markets during the early
and latter parts of 1995 due to the Mexican crisis, the Philippine
peso remained relatively stable.
</P>
<P>
The destabilizing effects on domestic prices of the rice
shortage during the third quarter last year and expectations of a
fuel price increase posed a significant challenge.
</P>
<P>
However, the average inflation rate of 8.1 percent for 1995 was
still the second lowest during the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
Singson identified the main concerns for 1996 as the wages
issue and the oil price increases.
</P>
<P>
These important issues will influence inflation this year,
which in turn will have a bearing on interest rates and the
exchange rate, he added.
</P>
<P>
He assured that the central bank will remain vigilant in its
conduct of monetary policy so that the negative effects of these
factors can be minimized.
</P>
<P>
The country's economy grew by 5.8 percent in the first three
quarters of 1995 and is estimated to grow by 6 percent for the
whole year of 1995. The government is projecting a 6.5 percent to
7 percent economic growth this year.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted within January 5-15, 1996, with 19
percent of the Makati Business Club members responding to the
survey.
</P>
<P>
Of the respondents, 73 percent occupy top management positions
in their companies while another 22 percent belong to the middle
management positions. Almost 80 percent of the respondents are
Filipinos.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Continue Reform Trade System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is to step up trade and
market reforms as part of its "renovation" policy to transform the
economy into a market-oriented system, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Communist Party has put forward a series of nine
measures, including completion of a comprehensive legal system,
restructuring state-run industries and strengthening state-led
management of trade to improve the distribution of goods and
services which has hindered rapid development of the economy.
</P>
<P>
But the state will continue to play a leading role in key areas
of the economy, a resolution issued by the Communist Party's
central committee said.
</P>
<P>
Although significant improvements have been made through the
change from a centralized to a market-oriented economy, there are
still major problems in some key areas, the Communist Party says.
</P>
<P>
Small-scale, fragmented markets, the lack of long-term
relationships between manufacturers and traders as well as among
traders themselves to guarantee steady supply, illegal trading,
have all limited the development of the economy and adversely
affected the relationship between rural and urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The party urged the country to make better use of its economic
resources to improve the circulation of goods and services.
</P>
<P>
It also stressed that the expansion of overseas markets will
have to be based on the stable development of the domestic
market.

<HEADLINE> State Reserve Purchases 80 Billion Kg of Grain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- By January 10 over 80 billion
kg of grain had been purchased across the country for the state
reserve, accounting for 89.8 percent of the purchase plan for
1995, according to the State Grain Reserve Administration.
</P>
<P>
Of this grain, 45.31 billion kg was purchased in line with
state quotas, and over 34.785 billion kg was purchased by the
market. At present, Henan, Shandong, Guizhou, Guangdong, Jiangsu,
Fujian and Hebei provinces, and the Xinjiang Uygur and Ningxia Hui
autonomous regions have met the purchase quotas set by the central
government.
</P>
<P>
Although there was a relatively big gap between the purchase
price for grain within the state quotas and the market prices, the
purchase has been proceeding smoothly. The State Grain Reserve
Administration attributed this to the efforts of localities to
take effective measures to protect the interests of grain
farmers.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Singapore Steps Up Efforts to Protect IP Rights (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the 11 months after it came into being, the units carried
out 288 raids resulting in the seizure of copyright and trade mark
infringing goods worth more than 1.4 million Singapore dollars, or
about one million US dollars at market value.
</P>
<P>
In addition, at least 246 cases with intellectual property
rights as their subject-matter were brought to the courts in the
year 1995 alone, according to the TDB.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, in early November last year, the Singapore
parliament up-dated the country's Patents Act, which was adopted
in 1994, to conform to the World Trade Organization (WTO)
Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights
(TRIPS).
</P>
<P>
"Singapore is fully committed to the WTO TRIPS Agreement, and
will continuously uphold the protection of intellectual property
rights," said Ms. Ng Kim Neo, Senior Director of Trade Policy,
TDB, when commenting on IPR protection in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The TDB noted that surveys conducted by IPR watch-dog
organizations such as the US-based International Intellectual
Property Alliance and the International Federation of the
Phonographic Industry pointed to Singapore as having one of the
best IPR protection records in Asia.
</P>
<P>
As a result, recent figures from the Software Publishers
Association, an industry group representing more than 1,150
software firms, showed that software sales in Singapore increased
141 percent in the first three quarters of 1995.
</P>
<P>
This certainly reflected in part the higher market demand. But
it also came as an outcome of the successful efforts taken in
Singapore to combat software piracy, the TDB said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 19 (Xinhua) -- In its efforts to ensure that
the trade and investment environment at home remain competitive,
the Singapore government took additional measures to enhance the
protection of intellectual property rights (IPR) in 1995 and has
pledged to continue to uphold the IPR protection in the years to
come.
</P>
<P>
"The protection of intellectual property rights is integral to
economic competitiveness, since intellectual property is an
increasing component of trade and investment," the Trade
Development Board (TDB), a statutory board under the Ministry of
Trade and Industry, said today in its review for 1995.
</P>
<P>
Additional measures taken by the Singapore government in 1995
for IPR protection included imposing new film license conditions,
establishing a dedicated Police IPR Warrant Unit, prosecutions and
stiff penalties, and updating the patents act amendments.
</P>
<P>
Under the newly imposed film license conditions, video
companies, when submitting imported or locally made video
tapes/discs for censorship at the Board of Film Censors (BFC),
must make a statutory declaration that they hold the copyright or
have imported/made with consent of the copyright holders or have
made parallel imports.
</P>
<P>
The Police IPR Warrant Unit, set up in February in the Criminal
Investigation Department, now centralizes and speeds up the
execution of search warrants, thus assisting IPR enforcement
officers to secure the needed evidence for prosecution.

<P>
Momcilo Krajisnik, President of the Assembly of the Serbs, also

<HEADLINE> Fighting Spreads Towards Hargeisa In Northwestern Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 19 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 people were
killed and more than 17 others wounded after armed confrontations
erupted on Thursday in the south of Hargeisa, Northwestern
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The fighting was between supporters of the president of the
self-declared Republic of Somaliland and forces of the Somali
National Movement (SNM) supporting Abdurahman Ahmed Ali (Tuur),
the Deputy President of General Mohamed Farah Aideed.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts which took place yesterday flared up when the
SNM forces launched an attack on Hargeisa's airport which is
about five kilometers south of the city, capital of Somaliland.
</P>
<P>
The fighting which is steadily spreading towards Hargeisa may
endanger the international aid agencies operations in the region.
There is a growing fear that the aid agencies will desert

<HEADLINE> Huge Fall In Balance Of Payments Position In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's overall
balance-of-payments position in 1995 was estimated to have fallen
from a surplus of over 2,412 billion Zimbabwe dollars (260
million US dollars) the previous year to only 513 million
Zimbabwe dollars (52 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe yesterday said the reverse was
largely due to drought-related imports and a decline in exports
of over 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
''This is against the background of the drought and its
adverse impact on agricultural and agro-based manufacturing
exports, as well as higher import payments in 1995,'' the bank
said in its latest quarterly review.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that export earnings, which rose by 19.1 percent
in 1994, were estimated to have grown by only 6.8 percent in
1995.
</P>
<P>
It added that maize, sugar and beef exports had been affected
by the drought and were forecast last year to decline by 62.1
percent, 33.6 percent and 13.2 percent, respectively. enditem

HARARE, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Investment Center
last year approved a total of 362 projects valued at 390 million
US dollars compared to 365 projects valued at 580 million US
dollars approved in 1994, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The fall in investment level experienced last year has been
attributed to low savings.
</P>
<P>
Industrialists and economists said that the high interest
rates and inflation had made it impossible for companies to save
and invest and there had been fears that the country could be
turned into a nation of consumers if the trend continued.
</P>
<P>
Standard Chartered Bank Zimbabwe in its latest issue of

<HEADLINE> Tanzania: Food Imports To Be Inspected Before Shipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has directed that from now on, food importers will have to submit
samples to the National Food Commission (NFCC) for approval
before they ship the consignments.
</P>
<P>
This, however, does not substitute pre-shipment inspection on
ports of origin.
</P>
<P>
According to NFCC Registrar, Francis Shirima, the move is
aimed at curbing the rising violation of regulations governing
food imports.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters here on Thursday that the directive, which
takes immediate effect, also covers relief food imported by
religious bodies, non-governmental organization and donors.
</P>
<P>
Shirima hinted that flouting food importation procedures
before off-loading at the ports are on the increase. He warned
that importantion of inferior food on whatever reasons, is
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
He advised importers to maintain contacts with honest dealers
abroad in order to minimize chances of importing inferior food
stuffs.
</P>
<P>
He also directed dealers to ensure that their imports are
properly labelled and show manufacturer's addresses, identify the
brands, contents and manufacturing and expiry dates.
</P>
<P>
"This applies to both locally produced and imported food
products," stressed Shirima citing products people should be
aware of as tinned foods, canned beer and beverages in general.
</P>
<P>
According to the NFCC registrar, the regulations have been
imposed by NFCC in response to President Mkapa's instructive in
his new year message on importers of sub-standards goods.
</P>
<P>
Early December last year, 3,800 tons of imported wheat and
flour, property of a city-based businessman, Said Bakhresa, was
destroyed after it was declared unfit for human consumption.
</P>
<P>
In less than 30 days later, another 300 tons of wheat flour
imported by Biashara Jumla Limited was also destroyed in Dar es
salaam.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Sales of Ugandan cotton to
Kenya at Busia and Malaba border points are on the increase.
</P>
<P>
The cotton, according to a report reaching here today, is
being bought from the local farmers for 0.4 US dollars in stead
of the 0.35 dollars which have been the going price for a kilogram
of cotton.
</P>
<P>
In Kenya, the cotton is reportedly sold at 0.55 dollars per
kilogram.
</P>
<P>
The report claimed that this "unscrupulous" cross border
cotton sales are going because the dealers go deep in the
villages in the district in search for cotton and they offer more
money than the official Ugandan price for cotton.

KAMPALA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A dysentery has broken out in
Rukungiri district, southwestern Uganda and at least seven people

</P>
<P>
The first cases were reported early last December in Kambuga

Mugume attributed the outbreak of the disease largely to poor
sanitary conditions in the district.

He said records show that 55 percent of the latrines in the
district are dirty though latrines coverage is 90 percent.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank may suspend
project funding in developing countries for next three years
starting from July for the bank's failure to get money for the
development program from donors.
</P>
<P>
This was warned by the bank's Resident Representative in
Nairobi, Steve O'Brien when he was speaking to journalists
shortly after addressing the Eighth General Assembly of the
Non-Governmental Organization Council held here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He called on the poor countries to look for ways of
self-reliance because the bank and the UN agencies are
cash-strapped and are discontinuing with some of their operation.
</P>
<P>
O'brien said that high among the list of the bank's casualty
will be the sub-Saharan African countries which consume 50
percent from the international development agency's assistance
programs.
</P>
<P>
He said the current funds of the International Development
Association (IDA) which is the lending arm of the IMF and the
World Bank, for developing countries runs out in June.
</P>
<P>
But the donors have not agreed on whether or not to offer
more funds and in fact the largest donor, the U.S.A. has
expressed intention to cut its future spending and grants to
the IDA, Stephen O'Brien added.

<HEADLINE> HK Dollar Debt Market to Be Further Developed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong dollar market is
expected to be further developed, a spokesman for the Hong Kong
Monetary Authority said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the first comprehensive survey on local debt
market activities conducted by HKMA, the size of the Hong Kong
dollar debt market stood at 197 billion HK dollars (25.25 billion
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1995, the outstanding amount of exchange fund
bills and notes stood at 58.7 billion HK dollars (7.52 billion US
dollars) while that of private sector paper stood at 138.2 billion
 HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that as the Hong Kong dollar debt market is
still small compared with the banking sector and the stock market,
it has developed into an important avenue for raising funds in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 59.9 billion HK dollars (7.68 billion US dollars) was
raised through private sector debt issues, and the outstanding
amount of exchange fund bills and notes increased by 6.4 billion
HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, the increase in outstanding Hong Kong dollar
loans by authorized institutions was 115 billion HK dollars (14.74
billion US dollars) in the first 11 months of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Funds raised in the local stock market through initial public
offerings amounted to 7.6 billion HK dollars (974 million US
dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Yam, chief executive of HKMA, said "the results show
that the private sector Hong Kong dollar debt market is one of the
most liquid in Asia," adding that "with greater regional
cooperation, the potential for the Asian bond markets is
tremendous."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Palestinians Set for First Elections (By Xie Dongfeng) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 19 (Xinhua) -- For the first time in
history, over one million Palestinians are set to vote in
Saturday's Palestinian elections, which marks a watershed in the
development of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Although rejectionist groups are boycotting the elections, the
Palestinian Central Election Commission (CEC) calls them "the
beginning of a new democratic chapter in the history of
Palestine."
</P>
<P>
The CEC officials have estimated that more than 80 percent of
eligible voters will turn out Saturday at 1,697 voting stations,
a sign of democratic elections. They will elect an 88-member
Palestinian Council (PC) and its chairman.
</P>
<P>
The polls open at 7 a.m. and close at 7 p.m.. The 88 winners
from among the 672 candidates for the PC will be known by Sunday
morning, according to the CEC, while the winner of PC Chairman
will be announced Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Observers from 16 countries will monitor the elections.
</P>
<P>
The most prominent election monitor, former U.S. President
Jimmy Carter, heading a delegation from his Atlanta-based Carter
Center, arrived here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Premier Mario Soares and delegations from Egypt and
Jordan, 13 Japanese parliamentarians are also among the
monitors.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that the balloting goes on smoothly, thousands of
Palestinian policemen were deployed at polling stations
Thursday. Meanwhile, some 4,000 Israeli border policemen will
also be on duty to take care of overall security.
</P>
<P>
Despite stormy weather Thursday, candidates made their
last-ditch campaign effort to drum up support.
</P>
<P>
In Gaza, Fatah supporters sped down the main roads Thursday night
in two trucks decorated with flags and banners. They were rivaled
by independents such as Rawya Shawa, daughter of the late mayor
of Gaza City Rashid Shawa, who had four banner-bearing buses
exclaiming "Vote for Rawya Shawa" pass through Gaza.
</P>
<P>
In the Tufah neighborhood of Gaza, an outdoor rally in support
of Arafat were held.
</P>
<P>
Some candidates ran from street to street, from stores to open
markets, distributing their own propaganda materials to voters
in a bid to win as much support as possible.
</P>
<P>
Although the CEC officials predicted that the Fatah movement
will win over 60 percent of the 88 seats, the election battle
can still be very tough as there are 672 candidates.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is posed to be elected PC Chairman by winning more than
80 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
To some extent, it may be disappointing that only Khalil, a
social worker opposed to the peace deal with Israel, is running
against Arafat. Nevertheless, it clearly shows Arafat's
dominating position among the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
One of the last remaining issues of supervision was resolved
Thursday when Palestinians agreed that in Hebron, where the
Israeli army is still present, only uniformed and unarmed
Palestinian inspectors will patrol the 68 polling stations while
the Israeli army stay away.
</P>
<P>
So far, the radical opposition was relatively quiet despite
promises to campaign vigorously against the elections.
</P>
<P>
Israeli settler leaders said Thursday that they would not
disrupt the Palestinian elections.
</P>
<P>
Israel has sealed off the West Bank and the Gaza Strip from 4
a.m. this morning until the same time Sunday morning as part of
the tight security arrangements to protect against violent
attacks.
</P>
<P>
There have been numerous intelligence reports indicating that
Hamas and other rejectionist groups may attempt a massive attack.
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli soldiers were killed Tuesday near Hebron in a
drive-by shooting attack which Israel believed were carried out
by activists from the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine.
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, an anti-Israeli government rally
will be held in Jerusalem Saturday to protest against the
Palestinian elections.

thundered to a perfect run to lead a Swiss domination of the World
Cup men's downhill race at Veysonnaz, Switzerland, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under perfect weather conditions, Kernen dashed down the
formidable 3,500-meter course at Piste de l'Ours in a time of two
minutes 3.14 seconds for his first World Cup victory.
</P>
<P>
William Besse, the last Swiss to claim a downhill win in
Vail, Colorado in 1994, reluctantly yielded the title by merely
one-hundredth of a second in 2:03.15. He was followed by
compatriots Daniel Mahrer with 2:03.39 and Xavier Gigandet fourth
in 2:03.60.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time since 1987 in Mount Allen, Canada, that
Swiss skiers had claimed the top four places.
</P>
<P>
Brian Stemmle of Canada, having recovered from a near-dead
crash in Kitzbuehel six-years ago, registered a season-high fifth
place in 2:03.73.
</P>
<P>
Norway's Lasse Kjus, out of competitions for at least three
weeks with injuries sustained in last Wednesday's crash, remained
the overall leader with 956 points.

<P>
MANILA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
has received a 70.8 percent approval rating against a disapproval
rating of 23.1 percent in the latest survey conducted by Vox
Populi (the voice of the people), a public opinion magazine.
</P>
<P>
In its January 1996 issue, which published the results of the
survey, the magazine declared that "our figures giving the
president high marks, we believe, are more indicative of the true
sentiments of Metro Manilans."
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted from November to December last year.
</P>
<P>
The approval rating, however, was lower than the 77.2 percent
the president obtained for the period of September to October
1995.

<HEADLINE> Explosive Mixture Found in Malaysian Refugee Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian police today
recovered materials for making explosives which were buried in the
Vietnamese refugee transit camp in Sungai Besi here, where 24
people were injured in rioting by the inmates Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Police officials told the press that a bomb disposal squad dug
out a green cloth bag containing a white powder mixture in two
plastic bottles and several strips of wires. Police believed that
those materials could be used to produce explosives.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese refugees in the camp Thursday torched two blocks
of residential buildings and clashed with the police in the worst
rioting in the camp's seven-year history.
</P>
<P>
Police were forced to open fire and use water cannons and tear
gas when the armed Vietnamese refugees hurled stones on police
personnel. Police quelled the disturbance and seized an array of
home-made weapons.
</P>
<P>
The 4,368 Vietnamese boat people in the camp are scheduled to
be repatriated to their own country by June this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) representative Erica Feller said here today that at least
60 of the Vietnamese boat people would be repatriated to their
homeland next week.
</P>
<P>
"The word now is GO as nothing will deter the plan. The burning
of their shelters at the camp will not change our plan to go ahead
with the repatriation program," Feller said.

<HEADLINE> Seven-Year-Old HK Girl Died after Gas-Sniffing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A seven-year-old Hong Kong
girl died after sniffing lighter fuel with her brother last April,
an inquest heard here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
And an expert called yesterday for controls on the sale of
lighter gas to children and also for a ban on the sale of toy air
pistols that use lighter fuel.
</P>
<P>
The girl, named Leung Mei-ling, soaked her bed sheets with the
gas and fell asleep forever after inhaling the lethal fumes with
her brother for about three hours for fun, the local press
reported.
</P>
<P>
When their mother came home from work and saw her children
curled up on the bed on April 7 with her daughter's lips blue, she
immediately called for an ambulance to send them to hospital. But
doctors were unable to save Mei-ling, who had died of the diverse
effects of butane and propane gas.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy is the third reported case in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Last night, Mei-ling's nine-year-old brother, Chi-wing, told
the hearing how gas-sniffing cost him his sister. The boy bought
fuel from a local store a number of times, claiming he needed it
for his toy air pistol when he had actually become addicted to it.
</P>
<P>
Although lighter fuel abuse is fairly rare in Hong Kong
compared with other countries and regions, it is thought to be on
the rise.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Director of Electrical and Mechanical Services Keith
Whittle called for lighter controls on the sale of LPG gas
containing butane and propane and he stressed his concern at
hearing lighter fuel was being used in toy air pistols as a cheap
alternative to the recommended Japanese gas.
</P>
<P>
He called for a ban on toy air pistols using lighter fuel,
saying that it could cause an explosion.
</P>
<P>
Whittle told the inquest that measures such as new labelling on
canisters were being introduced in Hong Kong, and an additional
warning to keep fuel from children and not to inhale the contents
would become a standard practice by Spring.
</P>
<P>
The grim experience changed the life of the boy. "I'll never
dare to do it again," he said.
</P>
<P>
The boy's father, a fisherman, did not want to talk about his
daughter's death but said he had some precious advice for other
parents.
</P>
<P>
"Children do not know much. Keep an eye on them or they will
do something wrong," he said.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Chechen Hijacker: Hijacked Ferry Not to Reach Bosphorus Strait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Muhammed Tokcan, leader of the
pro-Chechen hijackers, declared today that the hijacked ferryboat
would not go into the Bosphorus Strait for the security of
Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Kanal D tv through radio telephone,
Tokcan said the ship, hijacked in the Black Sea port of Trabzon in
north-eastern Turkey Tuesday night, would arrive at Anadolu Feneri
Cakal port before 11:00 gmt.
</P>
<P>
Referring to whether to blow up the hijacked boat where there
are some 200 Russian and Turkish hostages, Tokcan said: "I have no
comment."
</P>
<P>
Turkish caretaker Prime Minister Tansu Ciller Thursday
strongly condemned "all acts of terrorism" that put the lives of
innocent people in jeopardy no matter what the underlying cause
might be.
</P>
<P>
Ciller said that the Turkish government would not allow the
hijacked ferry to reach the Bosphorus Strait.
</P>
<P>
She said she had received a message from Russian Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and had informed him on the measures
Turkey was taking to ensure the safety of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Despite the careful stance adopted by the government wary of
increasing chill in relations with moscow, the Turkish public and
media have openly sided with the Chechens in their struggle
against Russia.
</P>
<P>
Like most of the Caucasian peoples, Chechens have linguistic
and cultural ties to Turks.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been viewing with increased suspicion Turkey's
attempts to develop close political and economic ties with
Turkic republics in Asia which gained their independence after
the collapse of the Soviet Union. But Turkish officials have
been dismissing Russian complaints that volunteers from Turkey
were fighting in Chechnya and Chechen fighters were receiving
military training in Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Euro-Chinese Entrepreneurs Club Founded in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A new club composed of European
and Chinese entrepreneurs has been established here to enhance
trade and other exchanges between China's mainland, Macao and
nations of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Entrepreneurs from Italy, German, France, China's mainland, and
Macao held a meeting today to inaugurate the Euro-Chinese
Entrepreneurs Club, which aims to promote cooperation and
commercial exchanges among them.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the meeting said that the club will provide
members with information on trade, investment, technology transfer
and cooperation opportunities in the three regions involved.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the club will organize visits and business
meetings for members, give them assistance in dealing with the
necessary legal and other formal procedures, and give advice about
legal environment for business in Macao, China's mainland and the
EU.
</P>
<P>
Hu Deping, vice-chairman of the All-China Federation of
Industry and Commerce, spoke highly of the club at today's
meeting, saying that it will be beneficial to entrepreneurs in
the three regions.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the club will help reduce frictions between the
European Union and China, and help benefit both parties," he said.
</P>
<P>
Macao is regarded as an important channel for China to get
access to the EU market and vice versa, as it has preferential
trade agreement with the EU.
</P>
<P>
Victor Rodrigues Pessoa, under-secretary for economic and
financial affairs of the Macao Government, praised the forming of
the club as "of strategic importance" for Macao even after 1999,
when China will resume its exercise of sovereignty over Macao.

</P>
<P>
Within an area of 20 sq km, 11.4 billion cu m of gas is planned
for first phase development. The gas will be transported to the
newly-completed Beicai Coal Gas Plant for processing and then sent
to families with a daily supply of 1.2 million cu m.
</P>
<P>
As fuel, natural gas is more powerful and cleaner than coal
gas.

<P>
MANILA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A Filipino-Canadian joint
venture company will establish an industrial estate in a province
north of Metro Manila with an estimated investment of one billion
pesos (40 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Billy Lim, president and chief executive officer of Long River
Developers Corp., said today that the proposed industrial park
will cover about 160 hectares of land and is expected to be
operational by 1998.
</P>
<P>
The project, expected to boost the local economies of Pampanga
and Bulacan provinces, has already generated interest from local
and foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
Talks have already began with several possible locators,
including South Korea's Daewoo Corp., the beer-based food
manufacturing giant San Miguel Corp., and other medium-sized
industrial firms.
</P>
<P>
In partnership with Vancouver High-Tech Development Ltd., the
Philippine land developer plans to build another four to five
industrial estates all over the country.
</P>
<P>
According to Lim, company officials are currently looking for
possible sites in the provinces of Batangas, Cagayan de Oro, Cebu,
Iligan, Iloilo, Negros and Quezon.
</P>
<P>
"Investors would have a wider choice of the sizes of industrial
lots, providing an alternative to the already crowded areas in the
south," project director Wilfredo Espiritu noted.

<HEADLINE> HK People Shown Submissive to Air Pollution -- Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong people would rather
pay more to move to districts with fresher air than think of ways
to improve the environment, according to a survey.
</P>
<P>
Initial findings of a research report by the Open Learning
Institute indicated that a majority of people have a passive
attitude towards environment protection, the local newspaper
"South China Morning Post" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The one-year study, which was made public Thursday, covered
1,000 households on six estates in two areas widely regarded as
among the most polluted in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Air quality has its value," Dr. Ho Kin-chun, a researcher and
senior lecturer at the institute's school of science and
technology, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that about 30 percent of respondents believed
property prices would drop if the air quality in the district
worsened.
</P>
<P>
"And respondents with higher education and incomes are willing
to pay up to 10 percent extra on the price of a flat to move to
areas where air is cleaner," said Ho, who is also vice-chairman of
Green Power, an environmental concern group.
</P>
<P>
But he said that all interviewees failed to suggest
anti-pollution measures they believed could be effective.
</P>
<P>
They choose to rid themselves of the environmental hazard not
by seeking ways to improve ambient air quality, but by moving
out. And they say they would put up with the dirty air if they
could not afford to move to healthier areas," Ho said.
</P>
<P>
Residents in some areas had to keep their windows closed all
day to protect themselves from the polluted air.
</P>
<P>
Chartered surveyor and property consultant Tony Chan Tung-ngok
agreed that air quality was an important factor now affecting
property prices, particularly in older districts.
</P>
<P>
In Tsuen Wan for example, prices of flats in the old town
center could be 30 to 40 percent lower than those in recently
developed coastal areas, he said.

<HEADLINE> Aircraft Maintenance Plant Operational In Xiamen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A modern commercial aircraft
maintenance plant has become operational in this emerging economic
center in east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Southeast to the Gaoqi International Airport, the Taikoo
(Xiamen) Aircraft Maintenance Center is China's fifth major
aircraft maintenance base after those in Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou and Chengdu.
</P>
<P>
With a total investment of 63 million US dollars, the center is
the first project of the Taikoo (Xiamen) Aircraft Engineering
Co. Ltd., a joint venture partnered by six companies from China,
Britain, Japan and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
A key project in Xiamen's drive to establish an aviation
industry zone in the city, the center occupies an area of 156,000
sq meters.
</P>
<P>
Construction on the first phase of the project began in May of
1994, which includes a 151.5-m-wide and 90-m-long hangar able to
acommodate two Boeing 747 widebodies and three narrow-bodied
planes, a working site of 26,000 sq meters adjacent to the hangar,
a parking apron of 22,000 sq meters, and a living quarter of
30,000 sq meters for employees.
</P>
<P>
At present, the center's business focus is on maintenance of
Boeing 747 planes. It will gradually expand to service Boeing 737s
and other commercial airplanes. It has received business orders
up to September this year.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs, Croats, Muslims Wrangle over Map Dividing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Border-drawing talks between
Bosnian Serbs and the Muslim-Croat federation produced no results
Thursday as both sides rejected each other's proposals, a senior
Bosnian official said.
</P>
<P>
"The pace of (Serbs') talks with the Croat-Muslim federation is
dissatisfactory," Velibor Ostojich, Chairman of the Border-drawing
Committee of Bosnia told the Bosnian Serb Television after the
first round of negotiations between Serbs and the Muslim-Croat
federation in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
The talks were focused on the map dividing in the two regions
of Bihac and Majevica.
</P>
<P>
Ostojich said the Serbs demanded seven villages in the two
regions, while the Muslim-Croat federation requested a narrow
corridor in the Omarska region and villages in the Stolica region.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs refused to gave away some Serb-populated villages
west of a lake, which the Muslims and Croats are intent on getting.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides agreed to resume talks on next Monday,
Ostojich said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Former Thai MP Extradited to US (by Yu Zuncheng) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Thanong Siripreechapong, a Thai
MP only two years ago, was extradited to the United States
Thursday to stand trial over charges of marijuana trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Thanong was the first Thai to have been sent to the US to fight
charges under a US-Thai extradition treaty, concluded 67 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
At the Bangkok International Airport, Thanong was put aboard a
Northwest Airlines flight to San Francisco, after corrections
department officials handed him over to Thai Foreign Affairs
Division police and US embassy officials the day before.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, Thanong was secretly indicted in a US court on charges
of smuggling as many as 49 tons of marijuana to the US between
1973 and 1987.
</P>
<P>
After the US embassy in Thailand revealed the charges to the
Thai government and demanded extradition in 1994, Thanong strongly
denied the charges, but shortly afterwards, he resigned as MP for
the northeastern province of Nakhon Phanom.
</P>
<P>
Last July, the Thai criminal court ruled on his extradition and
the ruling was upheld by the appeals court in December. That
decision was final.
</P>
<P>
Thanong, an influential person in his province, parliament and
business, then asked the Supreme Court to overturn the appeals
court's verdict, but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
Since the ruling on his extradition was announced, villagers
from Thanong's province, his lawyers and some of his friends have
strongly protested or lobbied to delay or prevent the extradition.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, more than 200 Nakhon Phanom villagers
rallied in Bangkok against the legal action and demanded he stands
trial in Thailand to "maintain the nation's dignity."
</P>
<P>
According to court procedures, he would be free if he was not
sent to the US within three months of the ruling.
</P>
<P>
Thanong's final extradition reflected closer cooperation in
drug suppression with the US, according to Pol Maj-Gen Amarin
Niamsakul, commander of the Police Foreign Affairs Division.
</P>
<P>
He praised the court for clearing up doubts about applying the
1929 treaty to suspects in Thailand. The Thai constitution
stipulates that a Thai can not be deported out of the country.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that if convicted, Thanong could be jailed for
between five to 15 years, but could seek to complete his term in
Thailand after serving one-third of his sentence.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Thanong's extradition, Thai Justice Minister
Chalerm Yubambroong said, "the Justice Ministry cannot help (him)
with anything," adding that Thanong's case in Thailand was over
since the extradition.

<HEADLINE> Henan to Develop Ancient Culture Tour Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan
Province has worked out an overall plan to develop travel programs
featuring its cultural relics resources.
</P>
<P>
The plan features a travel route along the Yellow River, three
areas of historic importance, and 12 cultural relics spots,
according to Yang Huancheng, director of the provincial cultural
relics bureau.
</P>
<P>
The travel route along the Yellow River extends from Zhengzhou,
the provincial capital to the Sanmen Gorge, via the ancient
capitals of Kaifeng and Luoyang. And the three areas refer to the
Anyang, Xuchang, and Nanyang where large amounts of relics from
the Shang Dynasty (16-11 centuries BC) and the Three Kingdom
Period (220-280 AD) have been unearthed.
</P>
<P>
These travel programs cover 60 percent of Henan's cultural
relics and 80 percent of relics collected by museums in the
province, according to Yang.
</P>
<P>
The director said apart from preserving existing scenic spots,
10 to 20 new ones will be built, and supporting facilities for
all these spots will be improved.
</P>
<P>
Henan boasts more than 30,000 cultural relics spots and its
museums have collect nearly 1.3 million pieces of relics, both
figures ranking first in China.

<HEADLINE> Urban Residents in Ningxia Better off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Living standard of urban
residents in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has
greatly improved over the past five years, according to results of
a survey made public recently.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that per capita income of urban residents in
the region reached 3,050 yuan in 1995, an increase of 1.4 times
over 1990.
</P>
<P>
It also showed that non-staple food accounts for 68.1 percent
of people's dining tables. High protein foodstuffs such as beef,
mutton, chicken, fish and eggs-- delicacies enjoyed only at
festivals a few years ago-- have become daily dishes of those
people.
</P>
<P>
The amount of money they spent on clothing increased 150
percent from 1990.
</P>
<P>
The traditional "four big sets"--bicycle, sewing machine, radio
and wrist watch-- have given way to color television set, washing
machine, refrigerator and tape recorder. Meanwhile, such top-grade
housewares as video recorder, hi-fi set, piano and telephone have
found their way into the homes of those urban residents.
</P>
<P>
Now every 100 families have 99 color tv sets, 98 washing
machines, 65 refrigerators, 18 video recorders and 15 hi-fi sets,
an amazingly high ratio even in coastal cities.
</P>
<P>
During the 1990-1995 period, basic public facilities such as
transport, sanitation, water, gas and power were also upgraded.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Silk Road Sees Tourism Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese section of the
ancient Silk Road, in the provinces of Shaanxi and Gansu and the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in northwest China, has hosted
more than 200 million tourists in the past 15 years, becoming a
hotline for overseas visitors.
</P>
<P>
The road, totalling more than 7,000 km long, started from
Changan (now Xi'an in northwest China's Shaanxi province), capital
of the western Han Dynasty, passed along the Kansu Corridor, Tarim
Basin and the Pamirs, ran through Uzbekistan, Turkmenia,
Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq, and ended at the sea ports in the
Mediterranean in Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The main traffic on the important mercantile route was Chinese
silk. Now an increasing number of domestic and overseas visitors
came to the road to trace China's old silk culture and experience
on doing business.
</P>
<P>
Last year Shaanxi hosted nearly 500,000 overseas tourists,
earning more than 100 million US dollars in foreign exchange, and
Xinjiang 200,000 visitors, reaping a profit of nearly 50 million
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Visitors to the road can take bus, train or ride horse, camel
to appreciate the west China folklore. Moreover, they may take a
small-scale airplane to have a bird's-eye view of ancient cities,
towns and oases.
</P>
<P>
Ren Xizhong, deputy director of the Xinjiang Tourism
Administrative Bureau, believes the road would remain a tourist
attraction in the coming years, with the Asian-Pacific region
having become a center of overseas tourism, and tourism in west
China developing fast.

<HEADLINE> Data: Palestinian Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian elections,
historic and unprecedented, will be held throughout Palestinian
self-rule territories on January 20.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-eight members of the Palestinian Council and the
president of the Palestinian National Authority will be
elected.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 of the 88 elected will be chosen as members of the
council's executive authority -- the Palestinian National
Authority.
</P>
<P>
Five more, not elected members of the council, will be
appointed by the president, called Rais, in his function as head
of the executive authority.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Palestinian Council will be elected by the 88
elected members of the council from among them.
</P>
<P>
The president of the Palestinian National Authority is elected
in one ballot and the members of the council are elected in
another. Voters thus cast two separate ballots and deposit them
in two different boxes, a red one for the president and a white
one for the council members.
</P>
<P>
The elections are closer to constituency voting than
proportional representation. The candidate who gets the most votes
wins.
</P>
<P>
There is more than one candidate in 14 of the constituencies.
</P>
<P>
The number of representatives varies approximately according to
population. The largest is Gaza City with 12. Salfit and Tubas
are the smallest with one each.
</P>
<P>
There are 672 candidates, approximately 7 for each seat. The
largest contingent, 92, is running in Gaza City, followed by
Hebron, 72.
</P>
<P>
Fatah and the People's Party are two largest groups. The
former has 76 candidates while the latter 21. As many as 506 run
in the independent list and women candidates total 27.
</P>
<P>
There are 80,051 voters in the Jerusalem district, which is
broader than the Jerusalem Municipality. Some 49,500 voters have
Jerusalem identity cards.
</P>
<P>
There are 165 polling stations in the district. Five in post
offices in East Jerusalem. The vote is counted as a postal vote
and the ballot boxes resemble post boxes, with slots on the side
instead of on top.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), Islamic Jihad, the
Popular Front for liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the
Democratic Front for Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) are officially
boycotting the elections.
</P>
<P>
But several of members of these groups are running as
independents. Presidential candidate Samiha Khalil is identified
with the DFLP.
</P>
<P>
The result of the presidential election is expected by 10
p.m. Saturday and the council elections by the following
morning.
</P>
<P>
However, a sample of three unidentified polling stations will
be counted Saturday and the results published before midnight to
give an indication of the general trend.

<HEADLINE> Large Water Diversion Works under Construction in Anshan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Construction of a large water
diversion project has been launched in Anshan city, a major
industrial base in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The project is to divert water from Lanhe River to a reservoir
in the vicinity of Anshan through a man-made tunnel. With a daily
water supply of 100,000 tons, the project, scheduled to be
completed by the end of 1997, is expected to meet the city's
demands before 2000.
</P>
<P>
The water diversion tunnel, 6,150 meters long, will cost 77
million yuan. With a ten-million-yuan loan from the Ministry of
Water Resources, the local government will shoulder the lion's
share of the finance for the project.
</P>
<P>
As China's biggest iron and steel industry base, Anshan is also
advanced in such industrial sectors as machine building,
petrochemical product, building materials and electronics.
However, inadequate water supply has severely hindered its social
and economic development. Currently the city is short of some
70,000 tons of water daily.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops
today stormed the main bastion of the rebel Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in eastern Sri Lanka in a new round of military
operation codenamed "Rivikirana," military sources said here.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the troops attacked the LTTE bastion
in Thoppigala jungle in the Eastern Province after a visit by
Deputy Defense Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte and commanders of three
services to the eastern battle front on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the fighting today, the rebel Tigers suffered heavy
casualties and the headquarters of the LTTE's eastern military
wing were besieged by the government troops, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
In a radio conversation with the LTTE leadership in Kilinochchi
in the north, the LTTE's military wing leader Larum said in
Thoppigala that he would defend his headquarters to the last
though he was under heavy attack from the government troops,
according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The government troops Wednesday started the Rivikirana
Operation from Maduru Oya on the border of the Eastern and
Northcentral Provinces. The troops were now moving eastward.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan military authorities launched the Rivikirana
Operation following reports on the rebels' building up in
Batticaloa, the major town in the Eastern Province, and on
increased acts of sabotage by the rebels to disrupt the life of
civilians in the province.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE, an armed Tamil group, has been fighting a guerrilla
war for a separate Tamil state since 1983. More than 50,000
people were reportedly killed in the ethnic war.

<HEADLINE> Turkish FM Hopes to Improve Ties with Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Deniz
Baykal expressed his hope for a new page in relations between
Turkey and Greece, the Turkish Daily News reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Baykal said Thursday that the decision by Greek Prime Minister
Andreas Papandreou to step down for health reasons had made a
change in the administration in Athens inevitable.
</P>
<P>
He said that a New Prime Minister in Athens will "represent a
new Beginning" for Ankara in its ties with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Baykal said that Turkey wanted good relations with Greece
regardless of who is elected Prime Minister in that country,
adding that the new Greek Prime Minister would also accept the
need for good relations with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"If, within the context of such an understanding, the chance
for a new beginning can be captured, then both Turkey and Greece
will benefit," Baykal said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of cooperation between the two
countries, Baykal said his belief was that "there is no major
problem preventing such cooperation."
</P>
<P>
"The Aegean should not be seen as a sea that divides Turkey and
Greece but as a sea which unites them. There are many fields of
cooperation. These, unfortunately, have not been explored due to
political concerns and unfair perceptions," the Foreign Minister
said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that in the coming period a political dialogue can be
developed quickly between Turkey and Greece, political contacts at
every level can be revitalized, an environment of peace can
prevail, the two countries can develop joint projects in this
environment," Baykal added.
</P>
<P>
Citing tourism as a field in which the two countries can
cooperate , he called on Turkey and Greece to declare 1996 as
the year of the Aegean."

<HEADLINE> China to mark World Consumer Right Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- As a member of the London-based
Consumer International, China will launch a series of activities
with the theme "Protecting the rights by means of law", to mark
the World Consumer Right Day which falls every March 15, it is
learned here.
</P>
<P>
"The theme is aimed at further explaining China's Law on the
Protection of Consumers' Rights and Interests which came into
force two years ago", announced Wang Jingming, Deputy Secretary
General of China Consumers' Association, at a press conference
today.
</P>
<P>
The issue of protecting consumers' rights has become an
increasingly important topic as China is advancing within its
newly established socialist market economy framework, observers
said.
</P>
<P>
Government market watch-dogs and consumers' organizations in
China want to make use of the occasion to further improve the
protection of consumers' rights by the government and social
organizations and arouse consumers' awareness to protect
themselves in accordance with law, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
To be staged in the Workers Cultural Palace in downtown Beijing
between March 15 and 17, the event is expected to draw experts
from over 30 central governmental departments to handle consumer's
complaints, answering hot questions on such hot topics as the
purchase of housing and telecommunication facilities, and
after-sale services. In addition, over 200 producers of
famous-brand consumer goods will come to display and sell their
products.
</P>
<P>
Fake and shoddy goods will be exposed and legal documents will
be spread during the event.
</P>
<P>
Further, special programs will be broadcast through China's
Central Television Station and related documents will be
disseminated to over 200 major cities to make the event national,
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The World Consumers' Right Day was designated by Consumer
International in 1983. China began to mark the day in 1986, and
after becoming a member of the world body in 1987, it has expanded
the scale of the event. This year's event will be the largest
ever.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Develops Tourism Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Xinjiang Uygur Automonous Region
in the remote northwest China has decided to invest 50 million
yuan in developing the ancient silk road in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
The project heralds Xinjiang's efforts to boost its tourism
industry, which has been designated by regional and national
leaders to spearhead the region's economic takeoff in the next
half decade.
</P>
<P>
"China has started a major drive to promote economic
development in central and western China, and Xinjiang's
development comprise a key part of this grand project." said
Abdul'ahat Abdurixit, Chairman of the autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
Aiming at making Xinjiang a major travel attraction in
northwest China, Abdul'ahat Abdurixit said the strategy to promote
tourism in the region shows Xinjiang's determination to achieve
an all-around industrial development.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Xinjiang received 200,000 overseas tourists, and the
industry earned 60 million US dollars in foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
The region is projected to receive 350,000 overseas travelers
and turn out earnings worth 120 million US dollar in foreign
exchange by the year of 2,000, with planned annual increases of 12
percent and 15 percent respectively for the two quotas in the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
According to Ren Xizhong, deputy director of the regional
tourism bureau, Xinjiang is rich in tourism resources and has rosy
prospects for future development of the industry.
</P>
<P>
With a total area nearly one sixth of China's territory, the
region is covered with mountains, forests, grasslands, and
glaciers, and Taklimakan and Gurban Tungget deserts.
</P>
<P>
At the middle section of the ancient silk road, Xinjiang used
to be the hub for economic and cultural exchanges between the east
and the west, and a conjunction point where the ancient Chinese,
Indian and Greek civilizations meet.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to its historical position, Xinjiang's unique attraction
represented by the numerous ruins of ancient cities, folk customs
and culture make it the place most worth visiting in the
hinterland of the Eurasian continent.
</P>
<P>
Ren said,"with the focus of international tourism shifting to
the Asia-Pacific Region and that of China's to the central and
western parts of the country, Xinjiang is bound to become a global
travel hot-spot."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the region welcomes overseas businesses to
participate in its tourism development.

that the suggestion, which France raised since a long time and was
repeated by its Foreign Minister Herve de Charette when he was in
Beirut two days ago, followed consultations Paris has carried out
with the U.S., Israel and some European countries.
</P>
<P>
The senior Lebanese official, according to the report, noted
that these countries did not oppose this possible French
participation in the future security arrangements in South
Lebanon, and that de Charette would discuss this issue with Syrian
leaders during his visit in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
De Charette wound up Thursday a two-day visit to Syria in which
he had talks with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara and
President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese official added that France expressed "since a long
time" its readiness to take part in the possible security
arrangements in South Lebanon and the Golan Heights in case a
peace agreement is reached between Israel on one side and Syria
and Lebanon on the other, which provides an international
participation in security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to a French presence in South Lebanon within the
U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) which was sent there in
accordance with the resolution 425 adopted by the U.N. Security
Council in 1978.
</P>
<P>
"France puts forward the proposal now because of a possibility
that a peace agreement between Lebanon and Israel will lead to a
formation of a multi-national force to replace the UNIFIL," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted well-informed diplomatic sources as saying
that the French offer came following a coordination with the
European countries especially with Germany, and it will ensure a
European role in the peace settlement in the region.
</P>
<P>
On an Arab position on the French participation in the
security arrangements, the report quoted Lebanese sources close
to the talks which de Charette held in Beirut as saying that "the
Arab position generally, since a long time, welcomes any European
and French role."

<P>
CANBERRA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Third Seed Thomas Muster of
Austria overcame a right ankle injury to defeat Nicklas Kulti of
Sweden in the third round of the Australian Open tennis tourney in
Melbourne on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Muster, winner of last year's French Open, went all out to win
over Kulti 6-4, 7-6 (11-9), 6-4 with bandage on the injured ankle.
</P>
<P>
With the first set down, Kulti managed to make it level at 9-9
after trailing 6-7 in the second set. But Muster came back
strongly to take the crucial tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
The third set was as tough as the second. But Muster kept up
his speed despite the torn ankle and dominated the match.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian will face another Swede, Mikael Tillstrom in the
fourth round on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Muster's victory was preceded by the retirement of Dutch
Richard Krajicek, who was hit by a lower back injury in the third
set against French Jean-Philippe Fleurian when the two levelled at
one set all.
</P>
<P>
Krajicek, seeded 11th in the Open, is regarded as one of the
most injury-prone players on the men's circuit and last week
pulled out of the Colonial Classic match against Patrick Rafter
with an upper arm complaint.
</P>
<P>
Fleurian, the lucky 31-year-old, had beat former world number
one Stefan Edberg of Sweden in the second round on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Third seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain advanced to the
fourth round after beating American Sandra Cacic.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez, ranked third in the world, ousted Cacic in straight
sets of 6-3, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Sixth seed Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina also reached the
fourth round by beating German Karin Kschwendt 6-1, 6-2, while
American Chanda Rubin overwhelmed Laurence Courtois of Belgium
6-0, 6-2 in the third round.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Welcomes Drug Warlord's Surrender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The official English-language
newspaper New Light of Myanmar today carried an editorial
welcoming "the return to the legal fold" of drug warlord Khun Sa
and his Mong Tai Army (MTA).
</P>
<P>
The editorial said that peace is blooming in almost all areas
of Myanmar, with the latest in the Homong region.
</P>
<P>
"This was the area associated with the notorious Golden
Triangle where not peace, but opium poppies, bloomed and the
deadly derivatives of the drug flowed where the demand was," it
said.
</P>
<P>
"Today, as we welcome the MTA men to our embrace, we must
resolve to work together to rid the region of the root of that
evil, the menace of hard drugs," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar Minister for Progress of Border Areas and National
Races and Development Affairs Lt. Gen. Maung Thint and Khun Sa
attended the MTA surrendering ceremony in Homong region in eastern
Shan state Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the Myanmar State Law and Order
Restoration Council (SLORC) warmly welcomed Khun Sa and the MTA
under his command.
</P>
<P>
Khun Mong, a chieftain of the MTA, addressed the ceremony on
behalf of Khun Sa.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the determination to cooperate with the Myanmar
armed forces and people under the leadership of the government and
to work for the benefit and the future of the state while
forgetting the past.
</P>
<P>
Khun Mong also expressed apology that Khun Sa and his MTA had
done wrong to wage an armed struggle against the government in the
past.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official statistics, a total of 9,749
MTA members, together with 6,004 small arms and heavy weapons,
including surface-to-air missiles, surrendered to the government
between January 5 and 18.
</P>
<P>
At the opening of the Myanmar Industrial Fair in Mandalay
Thursday,  Second Secretary of the SLORC Lt. Gen. Tin Oo said a
3,000-strong splinter group led by Kan Jeed, who broke away from
Khun Sa last year, is now negotiating with the government. They
are expected to surrender to the government soon.
</P>
<P>
Tin Oo said that 15 out of the 16 armed groups in Myanmar have
now "returned to the legal fold" and the remaining one -- the
Kayin National Union led by Bo Mya is also negotiating with the
government.
</P>
<P>
Khun Sa's MTA began to disintegrate in the middle of last year
when ethnic Shans, the majority in the estimated 20,000-strong
MTA, defected from the MTA under the leadership of two Shan
leaders -- Dae Wain and Kan Jeed.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Reaches CONCACAF Gold Cup Final </HEADLINE>

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- An own-goal by host American
player in Thursday's semi-final match in Los Angeles sent Brazil
to head towards the CONCACAF Gold Cup final.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's final Brazil will meet the winner of the
Mexico-Guatemala semi-final in San Diego playing on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Americans got upper hand for most of the game and kept on
frustrating this under-23 Brazilian team that had scored nine
goals in its two first-round matches.
</P>
<P>
It was not until the 80th minute that Brazil had its turn. The
winning goal came when the young Brazilian forwards Savio broke
down the left and tried a low centre which deflected off the
dashing American Marcello Balboa and into the net past goalkeeper
Kasey Keller.
</P>
<P>
The result was most disappointing to the Americans who had
hoped to avenge two recent 001 defeats to Brazil in the second
round of 1994 World Cup and in the semi-final of Copa America last
September.

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Domestic Debt Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- China will increase the variety
and liquidity of treasury bonds this year in an effort to manage
domestic debt better and help the fledgling securities market.
</P>
<P>
"Starting this year, we will significantly increase the
proportion of tradable treasury bonds, especially short-term
ones," Li Dachun, deputy director of the Ministry of Finance's
Department of State Debt Management, told Xinhua here today.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of the bonds annually in recent years was around
30 percent. The remaining 70 percent were untradable certificate
bonds, which are similar to bank certificates but with a higher
yield.
</P>
<P>
This year's bond issue, which was determined by redemptions of
older bonds and the size of the budget deficit, is expected to be
larger than last year's record 153 billion yuan (about 18.4
billion US dollars) worth. China is to redeem 110 billion yuan
worth of due bonds in principal and interest this year, up from
75.67 billion yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
Another source says that since China resumed the issuing of
treasury bonds in 1981, the variety has stayed quite small, with
an overwhelming majority of them untradable. He explained tradable
ones accounted for only a third of the 330 billion yuan worth of
bonds outstanding by last year and the majority were in three or
two years.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the lack of variety and liquidity has to some
extent affected the development of the secondary market and soured
investors on them.
</P>
<P>
"Improving the structure and liquidity of bonds is a key point
in our reform of the treasury bond market," Li said, adding that
tradable bonds, short-term ones in particular, are also a must for
the central bank's plan to begin open market operations in April.
</P>
<P>
A major step in the reform of the bond market came at the start
of the year when the Ministry of Finance decided to issue discount
bonds for the first time. Valued at 13.5 billion yuan, the
one-year bonds have been underwritten by 46 primary dealers and 19
securities institutions and are currently on offer at a price of
89.2 yuan per unit with a par value of 100 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Li said that, starting this year, China will also float bonds
more regularly, instead of in one shot or two or three as was done
in the past, in order to avoid leaving funds idle.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that, if the economy continues to stabilize and the
inflation index keeps going down, the Ministry of Finance intends
to issue medium- and long-term bonds to reduce repayment pressures.
</P>
<P>
The director also said that China will issue foreign
currency-denominated bonds overseas but the timing depends on the
performance of the international economy and their financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
China has issued treasury bonds valued at 470 billion yuan
since 1981, with the annual amount growing quite rapidly in recent
years.

<HEADLINE> Israel Imposes Closure on Gaza, West Bank in Advance of Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Israel has announced to seal
off the Gaza Strip and West Bank as of this morning, one day
before the Palestinian elections.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement of a spokesman of the Israel
Defense Forces, the closure went into effect at 4 o'clock this
morning and will last until the same time on January 21.
</P>
<P>
The object of the closure is to prevent right-wing extremists
in Israel from reaching polling stations in Area B of the West
Bank, in which 800 polling stations will be located.
</P>
<P>
Under the Palestinian-Israeli Oslo 2 agreement, Israel is
responsible for the overall security of Area B. However, it is
apparent that the main concern is the possible cross-border
attacks from the fundamental groups during the period.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian notables, foreign observers monitoring the
election and journalists are not affected by the move. Special
permission will be given for humanitarian cases.

three games in the following three sets before winning 4-6, 6-0,
6-2 and 6-1.
</P>
<P>
It was a tremendous match to watch, in which Agassi moved
swiftly along the baseline and put flat, deep shots into his
opponent's open court.
</P>
<P>
It took Agassi only 19 minutes to finish the second set, the
fastest ever seen on the center court in Flinders Park this year.
</P>
<P>
His two-handed backhand strokes proved too powerful for Bryan
to handle.
</P>
<P>
The world number two also stormed across the court to return
shots and put a number of hard-stretch volleys into Ryan's court.
</P>
<P>
Bryan fought back with some smart shots that just landed on the
sidelines, but seemed to fall half a pace behind Agassi throughout
the last three sets.
</P>
<P>
"I just put a bit more in it and ensured that I got fair
control on the court," Agassi said after the match.
</P>
<P>
He said that Bryan played quite well and had a lot of
opportunities during the match.
</P>
<P>
Agassi will clash with the winner of the match between Todd
Martin of the United States and Swede Jonas Bjorkman in the next
round.

<HEADLINE> More HK People Switch to Healthy Living: Organization Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's traditionally
materialistic society is now changing, with emphasis on health and
nature, according to the Friends of the Country Parks Association.
</P>
<P>
Tam Wing-kun, the association's chairman, said that the number
of local people using country parks now averaged between 20,000
and 30,000 on peak weekends during November and December, the
local newspaper Eastern Express reported.
</P>
<P>
"People used to place more importance on material enjoyment --
nice dresses, good suits and good food -- but recently the trend
is to turn back to nature," Tam was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
People are learning to think of the country parks as more than
just empty land, and that they are places to rebuild family
communications, get fit and learn about Hong Kong's natural
environment, Tam said.
</P>
<P>
Walking on weekends is an activity for all ages, which provides
a chance for families to spend time together, the association
chief said.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is so busy now that it is difficult for parents to
get along with their children for a long period of time," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Either they have to work in the evenings or they are too tired
or they have their own entertainment like mahjong.
</P>
<P>
"There would seem to be a generation gap," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Tam cited the new 78-kilometer Wilson Trail as a future main
attraction for weekend walking. The Trail, named after the former
Hong Kong governor and a keen hiker Lord Wilson, opens on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It has been divided into 10 sections, each rated according to
the level of difficulty, ranging from easy family walks to
"professionals only" work-outs, according to Tam.
</P>
<P>
The Association was commissioned by the local government to
design the new trail and raise the 20 million HK dollars
construction cost, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Closer Ties with Taiwan for Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Exchanges between Shanghai and
Taiwan have increased over the past year in spite of the damage
done by Li Teng-Hui's visit to the United States, a senior
official in charge of Taiwan affairs said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This comment came from Zhang Zhiqun, head of the municipal
government's Office of Taiwan Affairs, at a city government
government reviewing its ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, China's largest city approved 388 Shanghai-Taiwan
joint ventures involving 825 million U.S. dollars in Taiwanese
investment, and approved 2,546 Taiwan-funded businesses, with a
total investment of 4.88 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the year, investment from Taiwan accounted for 14
percent of overseas investment promised to Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
A total of 351 projects or exchanges in health, education,
sports, banking, insurance, aviation and many other area, were
carried out last year, and more than 20 Shanghai art groups,
including acrobat and ballet troupes, and puppet show, were
invited to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Exchanges now involve visits to Taiwan by mainlanders. In 1995,
2,942 Shanghai residents visited Taiwan, 68 percent higher than
the previous year, while Taiwanese visitors totalled 110,000 in
1995. Senior officials and celebrities account for a large part of
the Taiwanese visitors to Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 8.31 million pieces of mail and 12 million phone calls
were exchanged across the Taiwan Straits, according to official
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Vice-mayor Sha Lin said at the conference that the
city will strive to develop economic ties between Shanghai and
Taiwan to the benefit and for the common prosperity of both.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai will make greater efforts at improving its investment
environment and protecting the interests of Taiwan investors, the
vice-mayor noted, adding that science and technology exchanges,
and in culture and education will also be pushed.

cents (456.58 US cents) a kilogram clean, down from 623 cents (461
US cents) last week, the Australian Council of Wool Exporters said
today.

<P>
The Council also projected that about 900,000 bales of unsold
wool are in the hands of brokers nationwide.
</P>

"This retention rate is much higher than normal, but is having
little effect on the market while demand remains subdued," the
Council said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Shortage of Specialized Personnel Severe in Guangdong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The shortage of technological
and scientific researchers and engineers is more severe in south
China's Guangdong province.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, Guangdong has been leading the country in GDP and
personal incomes.
</P>
<P>
"But the number of specialized personnel is even lower than the
country's average," said Zhong Gengrui, deputy director of the
Guangdong Personnel Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Zhong added that the lack of specialized personnel is
handicapping fast economic development in the region,
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that out of every 10,000 people only 1,338
have received more than two years college education, 116 people
fewer than the country's average.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, the figure is 6 times as many.
</P>
<P>
And the average age for senior technical professionals is 53
years old in Guangdong, and 90 percent of them will have reached
retirement age by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Since 1979 when Guangdong started a nationwide campaign to
recruit specialists, over 330,000 technical specialists from
outside of Guangdong have joined in the region's workforce.
</P>
<P>
However, Guangdong's ability to attract the nation's best and
brightest is diminishing today. Many specialists have returned to
their hometown or to new development zones such as Pudong in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the situation, Guangdong will channel more funds
to train their own government officials and technical
professionals. More money will also be spent on supporting
professionals.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Guangdong needs another 900,000 special
technical professionals to meet needs of economic development by
2000.

<HEADLINE> Fujian's Power Capacity Tops Two Million Kw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, January 19 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province had
generating units with two million kilowatts total capacity by the
end of 1995, according to the local power industry department.
</P>
<P>
An official with the department says that the province
increased its generating capacity by 300,000 kw in 1995, and
invested some two billion yuan in power plant improvements last
year, 17.6 percent more than in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, quite a number of hydro-electric power plants went
into operation.
</P>
<P>
The official said that fixed assets of the power industry rose
from 2.9 billion yuan in 1991 to four billion yuan in 1995, while
local power companies had a total of 500 million yuan in profit
turned over to the state.
</P>
<P>
Electricity supply is now available to all urban residents and
98.3 percent of rural families.

<HEADLINE> hke - - Russia, Azerbaijan Sign Economic Accords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, Jauary 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Azerbaijan signed here
today a package of economic cooperation documents including an
agreement on the transit of Azeri oil exports via Russia,
according television reports here.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Azeri President
Geidar Aliyev, who arrived in Moscow to attend the upcoming summit
of the Commonwealth of Independent States (IS) scheduled for
Friday, signed the key oil transit accord.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the oil transit deal, Chernomyrdin told reporters
that today's accord "has established the hydrocarbon fuel pumping
scheme which had worked for many years."
</P>
<P>
He said there had been two alternative projects, so-called
northern and southern variants, or transit routes.
</P>
<P>
However, the two countries chose the Russia-traversing route of
exports as more profitable for both Russia and Azerbaijan, the two
former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
Aliyev told a news conference that the economic documents,
especially the oil transit deal, has been another step to
strengthen the two countries' economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Both men said they had no differences on the status of the
Caspian Sea, with five nations bordering on it claiming their
share of its biological and oil resources, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Azerbaijan see the Caspian as their interior sea.
</P>
<P>
According to experts here, the choice of the Russian pipeline
for tansporting early oil from Azerbaijan, from Azerbaijan's Baku
to Russia's Novorossiisk, is most expedient from the economic and
technological points of view.
</P>
<P>
"Eight months and about 60 million U.S. dollars will be needed
to prepare this pipeline for oil transportation. It will be
completely ready by the end of the year, when oil extraction is
expected to begin on the Caspian shelf," the experts noted.
</P>
<P>
The experts said that at the outset it is planned to annually
pump 800,000 tonnes of oil through this pipeline, the maximum
capacity of which equals to 17 million tonnes.

<HEADLINE> Singapore CAD to Complete Probe into Barings Case Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Commercial Affairs
Department (CAD) of Singapore will soon complete its investigation
into the role of former Barings officials, which could lead to new
prosecutions over the collapse of the Barings bank, the Business
Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
It said Finance Minister Richard Hu indicated in the Parliament
Thursday that Nick Leeson's conviction and jailing last month has
not closed the case.
</P>
<P>
A report by the inspectors commissioned by Singapore had
suggested that "other people might be involved with Leeson in the
fiasco," he said while replying to questions at a Parliament
session.
</P>
<P>
"The Commercial Affairs Department has been pursuing these
leads and they are in the process of finalizing their report," the
Minister said.
</P>
<P>
The CAD said last October that it was investigating top
executives of Barings for possible criminal offenses linked to the
debacle of the 233-year-old bank of Barings.
</P>
<P>
It said that any executives found guilty of offenses committed
in Singapore which contributed to the collapse of Barings would be
charged and prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
Leeson, the 29-year-old former chief trader of Barings Futures
Singapore, was sentenced to six-and-a-half years imprisonment here
last month, after being extradited back from Germany.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Allow More Teams for Mountaineering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to the Tourism Ministry, the new arrangements ware
made in order to promote the mountaineering areas and expand
economic and employment opportunities there.
</P>
<P>
Under the new arrangements, which would take effect from March
1, more than one climbing team would be allowed to use the same
climbing route in one season. At present, only one team could get
permission to climb a given route during one season.
</P>
<P>
The government also raised the number of members in a climbing
team which was allowed to pay the minimum royalty. Up to seven
members would be included in a team climbing mount Everest or
other snow peaks for the minimum payment, and another five members
could added on payment of additional fee.
</P>
<P>
Previous regulations only allowed a team of up to five members
to climb mount Everest on payment of minimum royalty.
</P>
<P>
The changes on the number of members were made out of
considerations of security and climbing difficulties, the Tourism
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The new arrangements would charge additional 20,000 US dollars
for each team climbing mount Everest via the conventional
southeast ridge route. Some changes have also been made in
royalties for climbing other peaks.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The agricultural income of the
European Union (EU) rose by 2.6 percent in 1995 over 1994,
the EUROSTAT, the EU statistics office, announced today.
</P>
<P>
The increase was attributed to agricultural policy reform,
which checked excessive growth in farm production but gave more
direct subsidies to farmers, a slight rise in agricultural output
after a decline in 1993 and 1994 and relative price stability.
</P>
<P>
Franz Fischler, EU commission member in charged of agriculture,
disclosed that direct subsidies to farmers will reach 26 billion ecus
(33.8 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The reform will be extended to wine, fruit, vegetable and olive
oil production.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Talk to Iraq on Oil Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali said he is ready to hold talks with Iraq on
its limited oil export in accordance with the terms set by a
Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz, who
wrote to Boutro-Ghali proposing talks if no conditions would be
imposed on Iraq, the U.N. chief expressed his willingness to start
talks with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been enforcing economic sanctions
against Iraq after the latter's invasion of Kuwait in August
1990. As the sanctions have crippled its economy, the Iraqi
people, especially children, have suffered badly from a shortage
of food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council adopted Resolution 986 last April,
allowing Iraq to export oil up to 2 billion U.S. dollars every six
months in order to purchase food, medicine and other necessities.
However, Iraq had rejected the resolution, saying the terms
represented a violation of its sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> Juppe Raises Plan to Rescue French Slums </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Alain Juppe
today put forward a plan aimed to revive poor urban neighborhoods
within five years by mainly creating jobs for the youth.
</P>
<P>
Juppe, who had promised in his election campaign last year to
renew slum districts, announced the package plan, named "Urban
Relaunch Pact," in the country's second biggest city of Marseille,
a port on the Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
The pact needs an annual fund of 5 billion francs (1 billion
U.S. dollars), of which 2 billion francs will be used to create an
estimated 25,000 jobs. The government expects to create 100,000
jobs in the next four years.
</P>
<P>
In order to increase employment and business in slums, the pact
promises to give tax breaks and partial tax exemption to
businesses and enterprises in about half of the 700 slum
neighborhoods. More than 20 "tax-free zones" will also be set up
in the poorest slums.
</P>
<P>
The government will enhance management over slum areas by
reinforcing police forces and establishing more public utilities.
</P>
<P>
A latest report released by the government listed 700
neighborhoods as poor and most of them are urban suburbs, where
public services such as schools, hospitals and transportation
facilities are seriously insufficient.
</P>
<P>
These areas are crowded with foreign immigrants and residents
with a low income who often choose to live there due to low rents.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate among the youth in these districts is two
or three times higher than in others. Moreover, some unemployed
young people resort to drugs, create riots and commit violent
crimes.

SANTIAGO, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Chilean President Eduardo Frei
has appealed to the nations of the Americas to intensify cooperation
in establishing a time-frame to eradicate poverty in the region.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a meeting organized by the government of
Chile in coordination with the Economic Commission for Latin
America (ECLA), the Organization of American States (OAS), the
Interamerican Development Bank and the Panamerican Health
Organization.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the conference, Frei urged the countries of
the region to "channel all our moral energy, political will and
technical capacity towards assuring that all the peoples of the
Americas achieve their full development."
</P>
<P>
He also called on governments to "advance further in
establishing instruments of cooperation and support" in the region.
</P>
<P>
"If we achieve substantial progress in these aspects," he said,
"our countries will be able to seriously and realistically commit
to a date for achieving the objective of eradicating absolute
poverty."
</P>
<P>
The president said that a large part of Chile's progress in
eradicating poverty was due to "our having maintained a 6 percent
average growth rate for over a decade."
</P>
<P>
High-ranking officials from the ECLA and OAS and the former
Colombian president, Cesar Gaviria, also made statements.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Issue ID Cards to Monks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will issue
identification cards to monks in the country as an immediate step
to strengthen security, especially for tourists, after a British
tourist was earlier this month found murdered by a Thai monk, the
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Monks will be required to carry their identification cards
starting from the end of March, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry and the Education Ministry were
consulting with the religious circle on detailed procedures to
issue the cards, a senior official from the Local Administration
Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The department under the Interior Ministry will authorize its
local offices to issue the identification cards through a
computerized system, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The move comes after a recent increase in criminal cases
involving monks in Thailand. A British woman tourist was killed
by a local monk in Kanchanaburi and her body was found earlier
this month. The case sparked concerns in the country.
</P>
<P>
The cards for monks, similar to the standard cards held by
citizens, will give the name of the monk, his domicile, and the
temple where he was ordained.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry expressed the hope that the cards would
give the authorities a record for quick reference to identify
monks in criminal cases or whether the accused is really a monk.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also urged related institutions to screen
carefully every man who wishes to enter the monkhood.

ROME, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) urged
today that a political solution be found to the Chechen hostage
crisis and called on Russia and Chechen rebels to stop their
conflict to avoid new bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by Italy, which holds the rotating EU
presidency, the EU said it was concerned with the bloody conflict
in the Pervomayskaya Village and condemned the action of
hostage-taking.
</P>
<P>
The hostage crisis broke out on January 9 when a group of
Chechen rebels held more than 2,000 people hostage in the village
of Pervomayskaya, Daghestan.
</P>
<P>
When negotiations to free the hostages were stalemated, Russian
forces started fierce attacks against the rebels on Monday,
causing many deaths.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the incident in Pervomayskaya showed that
the crisis can not be solved by force and that a solution must be
found through the resumption of political dialogue.
</P>
<P>
It added that the EU will continue to support the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe and other international
organizations in their effort to find a way to end the Chechen
crisis.

The land-check campaign was carried out by provincial land
management and supervisory departments to watch over governments
at various levels in the area of law enforcement for land
protection and the use of non-agricultural land from 1993 to 1994.

The province has ordered law breakers to pay fines along with
taxes or construction fees that they have evaded, and to register
land that is illegally occupied. In addition, a total of 1,189

The bank reduced today its two key rates by a quarter of a
percentage point to the lowest level in 23 years, cutting its
tender rate from 4.45 percent to 4.2 percent and its five-to-10
day repurchase rate from 5.85 percent to 5.6 percent. It last cut
its repurchase rate on December 21.

The interest rate on a three-month term was lowered from 6.25
percent in 1994-95 to 5 percent at the end of 1995 while the rate
on a 10-year term was cut to 6.65 percent from 8 percent.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hunan Profiting from Air-Raid Shelters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The capital of central China's
Hunan Province has had an annual net profit of some 42 million
yuan (about five million US dollar) from use of its air-raid
shelters in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
This has also provided nine million yuan in state revenues and
created 6,000 jobs for local residents, according to Liu Yingqing,
deputy director of the local air-raid shelter office.
</P>
<P>
Most of the shelters were built in the 60s and 70s, but are now
being used for storing fruits and for growing fungus and
traditional Chinese herbs, for which they are suited because they
are warm in winter and cool in summer.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 90 percent of the bananas sold on local markets were
stored in these shelters, which also produced 42.9 percent of the
fungus grown here, Liu noted.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the province has developed another 33,000
sq m of floor space in the air-raid shelters, most of it for
modern department stores, he added.

<HEADLINE> Poland Seeks Early Entry Into EU, NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Poland's President Aleksander
Kwasniewski said here today that it is one of his country's
"fundermental goals" to join the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
While meeting with Jacques Santer, president of the Commission
of the EU, Kwasniewski stressed that the EU's eastward expansion
is closely associated with the future of Europe.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of Europe splitting into two parts -- one
secure and rich and the other unstable and less developed --
cannot be avoided if Poland could not achieve its goal of joining
the EU, the president said.
</P>
<P>
The EU expansion is the best way for Europe to play a bigger
role in world politics and economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the president stressed that the expansion will require
the efforts of Poland and other East European countries as well as
the EU.
</P>
<P>
He explained that Poland is ready to accept the EU's proposal
for political, economic and monetary union of the EU member
states. To be integrated with the EU will be a "historic
challenge" to Poland, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced his hope that Poland could join the NATO as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
He said the NATO plays a strategic role and is the backbone in
building a new security structure in Europe. Poland's
participation in the NATO does not mean its opposition to Russia,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Poland is willing to further promote its relations
with the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski, who arrived in Belgium on Tuesday for a three-day
official visit to the NATO, the EU and Belgium, will return home
tonight.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the president also met with NATO Secretary
General Javier Solana, King of Belgium Albert II and Belgian Prime
Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene.

<HEADLINE> All Chechen Militants in Pervomaiskoye Killed: Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 18 (Xinhua) -- All the Chechen militants in the
Daghestani village of Pervomaiskoye have been killed and the next
target for the federal forces will be the strongholds of the
separatists in Chechnya, Russian President Boris Yeltsin said today.
</P>
<P>
All the bandits were eliminated, unless they had gone into
hiding underground, said Yeltsin at a news conference held in the
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 250 militants headed by Salman Raduyev, the
son-in-law of separatist Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, were
trapped in the village on Monday when the Russian special forces
and Interior troops began their hostage-freeing operation.
</P>
<P>
"We taught Dudayev good lesson and now we have to deal a
blow to his strongholds where there is no civilian
population in order to put an end to terrorism on Russian
soil," Yeltsin added.
</P>
<P>
He said: "It (terrorism) has already spread to Turkey. This is
already international terrorism. This cannot be tolerated."
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that the hostage-freeing operation was
conducted with "minimal" loss of lives among the civilians and
the federal military.
</P>
<P>
According to Yeltsin, 82 hostages were freed and 18 are
reported missing. The missing were considered alive rather than
dead. The president said: "They could be in hiding or have
run away."
</P>
<P>
He put the Russian military death toll at 26. Two out of the
250 "Alpha" (special forces) commandos were wounded, he said. The
casualty figure came from a report by his Security Minister
Mikhail Barsukov and Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov.
</P>
<P>
The crisis began on January 9 when Chechen militants stormed
into the Dagestani city of Kizlyar and took over 3,000 people
hostage.
</P>
<P>
After releasing most of the hostages, the Chechens were allowed to
leave the city. But around 160 hostages were taken by the
militants to ensure a safe passage back to Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The separatists, however, were stopped at Pervomaiskoye not far
from the Dagestani-Chechen border on January 10.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Russian special forces and Interior troops,
backed by tanks, artillery and helicopter gunships, launched a
full-scale attack against the Chechen militants holding some 300
hostages.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will
set up a representative office in Sarajevo to coordinate
international aid for the reconstruction of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
This was announced at a press briefing by Hans Van Den Broek,
commissioner of external affairs of the EU Commission.
</P>
<P>
He said the representative office led by Joannes Ter Haar, the
EU's special commissioner in Bosnia, aims to carry out "The Basic
Assistance Program" adopted last December in Brussels at the First
International Conference on Donations for Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, 50 countries and 27 international and
regional organizations pledged to provide 500 million U.S. dollars
to cover the most urgent needs of rebuilding Bosnia in the first
quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
The EU office, together with the World Bank, will work out a
framework for coordinating donations, Van Den Broek said. It will
keep in close contact with the Bosnian government and help to plan
a long-term strategy for the reconstruction of the war-torn former
Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
A peace accord was signed in Paris in December last year in a
bid to restore peace in Bosnia, which groaned under a war last
more than three years.
</P>
<P>
He said an EU team of equipment and personnel will head to
Sarajevo on January 19 to set up the EU office.
</P>
<P>
Besides humanitarian aid, the EU will offer one billion ECU
(about 1.3 billion dollars) to rebuild the warring countries of
the former Yugoslavia in the four years from 1996 to 1999, Van Den
Broek added.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the EU had provided 1.18 billion ECU
(about 1.53 billion dollars) of humanitarian aid to the
former Yugoslav republics by the end of 1995, half of which went
to Bosnia.

countries, Latin American officials said here today.
</P>
<P>
The organization should also establish development
strategies on an international level, said Carlos Juan Moneta,
permanent secretary of the Latin American Economic System (LAES),
at a regional ministerial meeting prior to an upcoming UNCTAD
assembly.
</P>
<P>
The ninth UNCTAD assembly, to be held in April in South Africa,
should constitute an important step in formulating a program to
pave the way for a new model of development, Moneta said.
</P>
<P>
According to the LAES official, positive economic development
in the process of globalization should not mean ignorance of
national specifics but seize new opportunities for opening up
markets, without underestimating the risks involved.
</P>
<P>
Manuel Jose Cardenas, president of the ministerial meeting and
head of the Colombian delegation, said the fall of the Berlin
Wall eliminated ideological barriers, while simultaneously
maintaining and even deepening the differences in the degree of
development on a world level.
</P>
<P>
In this sense, said Cardenas, the success or failure of
development policies depends in large part on a favorable
or unfavorable international environment.
</P>
<P>
He said UNCTAD should focus on seeking joint solutions that
reflect the interests of both industrialized and developing
nations, consider all the components and complexities of
development and are not limited strictly to trade.
</P>
<P>
According to UNCTAD General Secretary Rubens Ricupero, the main
tasks of the ninth UNCTAD assembly will be to determine how to
maximize the impact of globalization and liberalization on the
development process, while at the same time minimizing the risk of
instability and marginalization.

<TEXT>
<P>
DJIBOUTI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice Premier
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen held talks with Djibouti Foreign
Minister Mohamed Moussa Chehem here today on bilateral relations,
the situation in Africa and global issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the Sino-Djibouti relations have developed on a
broad front with fruitful economic and trade cooperation since the

</P>
<P>
China, which values her friendship with Djibouti, is willing to

Chehem described Qian's visit to Djibouti, the first of its
kind, as a great event in bilateral relations, saying his visit
will surely promote the development of the relations between the
two countries.

of Africa, in particular the territorial dispute between Yemen and
Eritrea.

<HEADLINE> Research and Its Application in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, one of China's major
scientific research bases made more than 11,000 major research
achievements during the Eighth "Five-Year Plan" period
(1991-1995), 3,804 of which were in the forefront internationally.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 38.9 percent of the city's research findings were the
world's most advanced, two percentage points higher than in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
A 905-mm-long vane for 300,000 and 600,000 kw steam turbines
was first developed by the city for use in both thermal and
nuclear power generating units, adding 100 million yuan in
economic returns to the country annually.
</P>
<P>
During the five-year period, the funding for theoretical
studies of the city increased annually. In 1994, funding from the
Municipal Science and Technology Commission alone reached 10
million yuan. The figure increased 20 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The research findings range from genetic engineering and
medicine to new materials and applied physics, and include genetic
resistance to cancer, which has contributed greatly to
understanding cancer.
</P>
<P>
During the five years, more research results have been used for
commercial production. In 1991, only 30.8 percent of them were
used in production, while by 1995, over 90 percent were.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 7,864 scientific findings have been
applied to varying degrees over the past five years for the city,
adding around 45 billion yuan to output value, 50 percent more
than that during the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-1990).

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Two Bomb Blasts Rock Lahore, Pakistan (By Pan Yi) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Two bomb blasts rocked
Lahore, capital of Pakistan's Punjab province, leaving a total of
28 people injured and causing a huge damage to property on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The first explosion occurred at a library of the Diyal Singh
College at about 8:30 am, injuring 23 people, including 19
students and four employees of the college.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen of the injured were discharged from hospital while
four others were still in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
Students and teaching staff of the college told newsmen that
students were reading newspapers in the library when a defeaning
blast rocked the entire building.
</P>
<P>
Fire broke out in the thirty-year-old library after the blast
and as a result, more than 50.000 books were reduced to ashes,
they added.
</P>
<P>
A Pakistani Government spokesman condemned the library bomb
blast.  He said Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who is on a visit
to Japan, was immediately informed about the incident and
expressed her sympathies with victims of the blast.
</P>
<P>
Bhutto condemned the burning of the copies of Holy Quran and
other books in a subsequent fire.
</P>
<P>
While the investigation into the blast was going on, a second
bomb exploded at a medical store in Saddar Bazaar, a commercial
center of Lahore, at around 8:35 pm.
</P>
<P>
Five shoppers were wounded in the blast with two in critical
condition, and the store was seriously damaged.
</P>
<P>
Police said that nobody has claimed responsibility for the
attacks so far.
</P>
<P>
But they pointed out that the aim of the bomb attacks was to
destroy the peaceful atmosphere in Lahore, the political and
cultural center of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
It appears that bomb blasts have become a common occurrence in
Pakistan since November 19, 1995 when two terrorists launched a
suicide bomb attack on Egyptian Embassy in Islamabad, leaving 14
dead and 60 injured.
</P>
<P>
On December 21, 1995, a powerful car bomb went off at a
commercial center of Peshawar, capital of Pakistan's Northwest
Frontier province, killing 19 and injuring at least 40 others.
</P>
<P>
On January 7 this year, a bomb exploded on an over-crowded bus
in Karachi, capital of Pakistan's Sindh province, leaving six dead
and at least 14 injured.
</P>
<P>
Faced with the severe situation, the Pakistan government has
stepped up efforts to cope with the escalating terrorism.
</P>
<P>
However, in view of the complicated and deep-rooted social
problems, terrorism could not be eliminated in the foreseeable
future, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Ningxia Farmers' Income Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The average annual per capita
income of farmers in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region, one of China's poorest regions, has surpassed 1,000 yuan
for the first time in the region's history.
</P>
<P>
On average, each farmer has earned a net income of 1,050 yuan
by the end of 1995, 140 yuan more than the previous year's figure.
</P>
<P>
This should mainly be attributed to a bumper harvest, increased
supply of farm materials, farmers' great enthusiasm in grain
production and vigorous development of village industry and
service trade.
</P>
<P>
In despite of severe natural disasters, the region produced two
billion kg of grain last year, the second biggest harvest in its
history. The output of meat, eggs and dairy products all
registered a rise between 20 and 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Local township-run industry grew rapidly in recently years. Its
total output value is expected to reach 5.47 billion yuan this
year, 3.8 times of the 1990 figure. The profits and tax paid by
individual enterprises will also rise greatly.

HANGZHOU, January 19 (Xinhua) -- As many as 102 low-income
workers in Ningbo, a coastal city in east China's Zhejiang
Province, have received papers certifying that they are
impoverished as part of the provincial labor union's efforts to

<P>
Preferential treatment is being offered to the people with the

<HEADLINE> British Troops in Bosnia Ordered to Arrest War Criminals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior British defense
official confirmed today that British soldiers in Bosnia will
detain Bosnian Serb leaders if the opportunity arises.
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Soames, the armed forces minister, said British
soliders in the peace implementation force (IFOR) were under order
to arrest any of the 52 individuals sought by the United Nations
International War Crimes Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
But he made it clear that the British troops would not seek
them out, saying "If they bump into these people at checkpoints
they will want to detain them."
</P>
<P>
The British troops would provide escorts for war crimes
investigators who may want to explore the sites of suspected mass
graves in the Serb-controlled areas in Bosnia, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The British soldiers were in Bosnia to join the NATO-led
multinational force to implement the peace accord signed in Paris
in December last year.
</P>
<P>
Britain was committed to exercise a "central influence" over
the resolution of the conflicts in the former-Yugoslav areas, but
would not keep its troops there beyond the planned time limit of
next December, he said.
</P>
<P>
The British Defense Ministry announced earlier today that the
deployment of 13,000 British troops in Bosnia would be completed
on schedule later today.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Scientists in northwest China's
Shaanxi Province has succeeded in making local milk cow produce
iodine-rich milk by feeding them with iodine-bearing fodder.
</P>
<P>
One litre of such milk contains 250-480 microgramme of iodine,
much higher than that of ordinary milk. The milk is not only for
direct drinking but also can be turned into milk powder, said a
researcher.
</P>
<P>
The iodine-rich milk was obtained through food chain and
conversion of inorganic iodine into natural organic iodine inside
the stomach of a milk cow.
</P>
<P>
The invention has obtained a state patent and been used in some
experimental milk cow farms in Shaanxi.
</P>
<P>
An expert from the Ministry of Public Health said development
of the milk has opened a new channel for helping people to absorb
more iodine and for eliminating the Iodine Deficiency Disorders
(IDD).

<HEADLINE> Family Planning Service Center in Small Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A woman sat in the waiting
room on the second floor of a four-story building, waiting to have
a loop put in her womb. The building at the end of a narrow alley,
houses the office of The Family Planning Service Center of Lubu
Township, Gaoyao City, Guangdong province.
</P>
<P>
"My son is 100 days old," the woman told the nurse proudly. She
said her name is Chen.
</P>
<P>
"Are you nervous about an operation?" another woman in the room
asked.
</P>
<P>
"No at all," Chen replied, laughing. "We have a very good
doctor here. Many people come from other townships to consult her."
</P>
<P>
Zhong Xinu, who is the "good doctor" Chen referred to and the
director of the center, began doing family planning work in
1982. Her husband, also a family planning worker, is with the
Township Family Planning Office.
</P>
<P>
"Our family specializes in family planning," Zhong often says
jokingly.
</P>
<P>
She has a 12-year-old son, but cannot spare time with him
because "I'm often too busy," she sighed.
</P>
<P>
Zhong performs birth control operations and provides
contraceptive devices and medicines to local people at
child-bearing age.
</P>
<P>
However, she has also helped 20 sterile women to give births to
healthy infants so far.
</P>
<P>
The center, one of the 1,600 family planning service centers in
Guangdong Province, serves 60,000 residents in Lubu Township.
</P>
<P>
When the center was set up in 1984, Zhong could make simple
gynecological checks only. Now, equipped with advanced instruments
such as ultrasonic scanner, doctors can perform much complicated
operations, she said.
</P>
<P>
Zhong, who has performed birth control operations on more than
10,000 women, has never caused any accident.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhong admits, "We are working at a grass-roots unit.
So we have to send those who need to have a very complicated
operation to better equipped family planning service centers in
urban areas."

MANAGUA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Five members of a peasant
family were killed Tuesday by armed attackers in the Cedron
region, 45 kilometers northeast of the town of Waslala, a local
newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Javier Olivas, the only one who survived the massacre,
the daily "La Tribuna" reported today that some days ago, 12
persons searched his family's house for money, food and firearms,
and threatened to return after they failed to find what they were
looking for.
</P>
<P>
Olivas, 19, said that on Tuesday the armed band returned to the
house and started shooting when finding it hard to enter the house
through the door.
</P>
<P>
"I was saved because just moments before (the shooting), I went
out into the woods to go to the bathroom -- that's when I heard
the shots and saw how they entered the house," one of the
witnesses said, "They stole a 22 calibre rifle and a chain saw."
</P>
<P>
A police officer confirmed the killings and reported that an
investigation is underway to uncover the alleged murderers.

<HEADLINE> 1.7 Million People in Zhejiang Free from Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Over 1.7 million people in
East China's Zhejiang Province were reported to bid farewell to
poverty in the previous five years, accounting for more than half
of the poor population in the province.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang is relatively prosperous province in the country, but
its population at the central and western mountainous areas have
scarce natural resources and weak economic foundations.
</P>
<P>
With more and more investment from coastal cities like Hangzhou
and Wenzhou and migration of residents from the arid areas, the
province's poverty relief paces were quickened in the past few
years, a provincial government official said.
</P>
<P>
The annual per capita income for a villager in Panan County in
the Central Zhejiang increased to 1,300 yuan last year from 300
yuan eight years ago. The annual financial revenue for the eight
poorest counties in the province was tripled over the previous
five years, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government allocated 10 million yuan every year
to undertake poverty relief projects in the previous five years,
while offering tax reductions and free loans to the people in
economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The poor population were also encouraged to work for poverty
relief projects with their payments taken as their own investments.
</P>
<P>
Those projects covered the production of tea, fruits and
medicinal materials and the industries of forestry and animal
husbandry.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang province also made a breakthrough in the country's
poverty elimination drive by encouraging people living under poor
natural conditions to settle in nearby towns or coastal areas with
better conditions, according to the official. In the past four
years, over 50,000 people were made better off this way.

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin To Visit Ukraine in March to Sign Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
will visit Ukraine in late March to sign a friendship, cooperation
and partnerhsip treaty, Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma, who arrived in Moscow to attend the summit meeting of
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) scheduled to open on
Friday, told a news conference here that the signing of the treaty
will not be linked with a final accord on the Black Sea Fleet
division between the two big former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the fleet has forced Yeltsin to postpone
his Ukraine trip five times.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma reaffirmed, however, that the problem of the fleet,
which is "de facto Russian," is still central for bilateral
relations. "From a military viewpoint, no problem of the Black Sea
Fleet exists," he added.
</P>
<P>
The only question unsettled is, in essence, whether the Russian
fleet will base in Sevastopol, the capital city of Ukraine's
Crimea, Kuchma pointed out. It will be impossible to settle it "by
a single motion" but there is goodwill on both sides to come to an
agreement, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The two countries' Defense Ministers are expected to meet soon
in Transcarpathia to furter discuss the problem, the Ukrainian
President told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon the fact that he and Yeltsin on Thursday sacked
the fleet commander Admiral Eduard Baltin, Kuchma said: "The
military should busy themselves with military issues and not
politics."
</P>
<P>
He also told reporters that Ukraine is "categorically
against the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), warning against dividing Europe into two military blocs.
"We won't survive a new confrontation," he emphasized.

<HEADLINE> Liberians Appealed Not to Slide Back into War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States has appealed
to Liberians not to allow their country to slide back into war,
said a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The US permanent representative to the UN, Maeleine Albright,
made the appeal wednesday while speaking to newsmen in the
Liberian capital of Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
"This country must not slide back into the abyss of a
devastating civil war again," Albright said, noting US Presient
Bill Clinton asked her to convey "this very clear message" to the
Liberian people and their leaders.
</P>
<P>
A statement by the US embassy in Liberia said Albright's
"primary interest is in advancing the process of peace and
reconciliation in Liberia."
</P>
<P>
The Liberian civil war which started in December 1989, has
claimed about 150,000 people and rendered many more homeless.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the U.S. "strongly supports the Abuja accord,
and we remain committed to its timely implementation."
</P>
<P>
Under the Abuja peace accord signed by all parties to the
Liberian conflict last August, the Liberian council of state, a
collective presidency, and a cabinet have been set up to run
Liberia till the general elections next August.
</P>
<P>
However, the most important and difficult part of the peace
accord, disarmament of the armed factions, has been delayed.
</P>
<P>
Albright condemned the recent fighting in Tubmanburg, saying
it "threatens prospects" for lasting peace in the war-torn west
African country.
</P>
<P>
She said, "the U.S. strongly condemns the deaths of innocent
civilians and many brave peacekeepers of (the West African
Peacekeeping Force) Ecomog."
</P>
<P>
The US diplomat urged all parties involved in the dispute "to
cooperate with Ecomog and stop the fighting."
</P>
<P>
Frowning on the some 6,000 child soldiers in Liberia, Albright
said that the era of the child soldiers in the country "must come
to an end immediately."
</P>
<P>
According to Albright, the U.S. has provided 420 million
dollars in humanitarian assistance and 60 million dollars in
support of Ecomog's peacekeeping activities in Liberia.

<HEADLINE> UN on "Brink of Financial Collapse," Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations stood
on the brink of financial collapse because of the failure of
member states to fulfil their legal obligations, according to the
spokesman for the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the spokesman today said that the
Secretary-General has repeatedly called the attention of member
states to the very critical financial situation of the United
Nations and has encouraged discussions on a number of far-reaching
suggestions to alleviate the problem.
</P>
<P>
"Alternative sources of finance" for the programs and
activities of the United Nations system have been recommended by
many commissions and study groups over recent years, the most
recent of which was put together by Yale University, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
During the recent 50th anniversary session of the General
Assembly, a number of member states raised such ideas. The
Secretary-General's remarks in London should be considered against
this background, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
If member states were to agree to an alternative source of
revenue, the expenditures would be totally under the control of
member states, as is the case with all current expenditures in the
United Nations system, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
According to latest U.N. statistics, the outstanding assessed
contributions to the organization totaled 2.6 billion dollars. Of
this amount, 640 million was for the regular budget and 2 billion
was for peacekeeping operations and the International Tribunals.
The current annual regular budget for the U.N. stands at about 1.2
billion dollars.

role in efforts to settle all the conflicts on the former Soviet
territory, diplomats here believe.

Force known as ecomog will stay in Liberia despite the latest
attacks by a Liberian armed faction that left at least ten of its
troops dead, Ghanaian Preident Jerry Rawlings has pledged.
</P>

28, Ecomog commander, maj.-gen. John Inienger, said Tuesday, "the
attack on ecomog soldiers by the Krahn wing of the United
Liberation Movement (Ulimo-J), have kept the peacekeeping troops
to wonder whether they are indeed wanted here any longer."

report.
</P>
<P>
The proposed body would operate at heads of state and
ministerial level, sadc Executive Secretary Kaire Mbuende said.
</P>
<P>
"It has long been realized that regional cooperation in this
sector requires a new and different form of mechanism to sadc's
existing sector portfolios," said Mbuende.
</P>
<P>
The organ would be co-ordinated by one of the sadc member
states, but not on a permanent basis.
</P>
<P>
"The co-ordinating country will be rotated annually," Botswana
Minister of Foreign Affairs Mompati Merafhe said.
</P>
<P>
The sadc meeting debated a proposal by the Frontline states in
Windhoek in July 1994 to form asas, but did not endorse it. It
also discussed the recommendation by the sadc council of
ministers in August 1994 that conflict resolution and management
be formed.
</P>
<P>
Mbuende said the decision had been taken to merge the concept
of asas with the concept of a security sector.
</P>
<P>
However, Merafhe said the task of the Frontline states had
been completed, but the issues of security, defense and democracy
would be with the member states of sadc for some time.
</P>
<P>
"We have to have a mechanism whereby we can come together to
take a common position on vexing issues, particularly defense
matters," he added.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech at the meeting, sadc executive chairman
and Botswana President Ketumile Masire said Southern Africa had
been a region of conflict and confrontation for several decades.
</P>
<P>
Masire said: +Sadc member states have committed themselves to
democratic principles, political tolerance, transparency and
accountability in the conduct of their affairs, respect for the
rule of law and human rights."
</P>
<P>
"The countries of Southern Africa recognize and appreciate the
importance of observing these principles," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sadc comprises Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius,
Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia
and Zimbabwe.
