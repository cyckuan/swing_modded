<HEADLINE> World Wheat Output In 1997 Expected To Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The world wheat output in 1997
is projected at 585 million tons, 5 million tons more than in
1996, according to a latest report by International Grains Council
(IGC).
</P>
<P>
The figure is based on the current information about several
major producers which harvested their bumper crops in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The report said: "Normal growing conditions could sustain
production in the EC, India and the United States, and Bring a
recovery in output in Central/Eastern Europe, Kazakhstan, Russia
and Ukraine."
</P>
<P>
These gains could be partly offset by smaller crops in
Argentina, Australia, Canada and China, the report added.
</P>
<P>
As far as grains' supply and demand on market are concerned,
Argentina, one of the world's biggest producers, continued its
successful export activity in Norther Africa and Central/Eastern
Europe, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Australia, another big producer, sold 1 million tons of wheat
to india and made further sales to Iraq, which also secured
supplies from France.
</P>
<P>
The maize (corn) market saw numerous reports of China's
possible return as a significant exporters, IGC said. Sales of
modest volumes were confirmed to some Far-Eastern countries, but
the arrival of a new crop supplies from Argentina and South Africa
is expected to heighten competition on the world market.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government today
issued an alert against the bubonic and pneumonic plagues amid
reports the plagues have killed over 100 people in neighboring
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to enlighten the public on the symptoms and
transmission of the plagues, the Ministry of Health and Child
Welfare said the country is, however, not immediately threatened.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Buthelezi Sworn In As South African Acting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Home Affairs Minister and
Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi today
took the oath as South African acting president in Durban,
Kwazulu/Natal Province, said a source here.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, President Nelson Mandela, in a surprising move,
appointed Buthelezi as acting president of the country during his
absence at the weekend when he and his deputy Thabo Mbeki attend
the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi's term of office will be from Sunday until Tuesday
when Mandela returns from Switzerland, said the source.
</P>
<P>
In terms of South Africa's new constitution, it is Mandela's
prerogative to name an acting president when he and his deputy
are both out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters shortly before the swearing-in ceremony,
Buthelezi said his appointment was a contributory gesture to
reconciliation between the IFP and the African National Congress
(ANC).
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi also thanked Mandela for the trust and confidence
the president has shown upon him "even though it is well known
that our organizations are in opposition to each other".
</P>
<P>
When asked what changes he would like to make during his
three-day presidency, Buthelezi said he "would be mad" to do so.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Commerce Chamber Urged to Facilitate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Chamber of
Commerce was today urged to exert maximum efforts in
facilitating export activities to narrow Ethiopia's import-export
trade gap with the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, Ethiopian Economic and
Commercial Counsellor in Saudi Arabia Seid Shefedin said although
Ethiopian produces have high demand in the markets of Saudi
Arabia and other Gulf countries, Ethiopia comes short of
supplying the items in the desired quantities.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters here today that Ethiopian agricultural
produce like crops, oil seeds, fruit, fish, meat products as
well as mineral water are among the products highly needed in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He noted that failure on the Ethiopian part to export these
products in sufficient quantity is one of the major reasons for
the trade imbalance between the Middle East and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Referring to investment prospects, the counsellor said
investors from Saudi Arabia and other Middle East countries take
the largest share of the registered foreign investment capital in
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
He said 10 projects in hotel, agriculture and construction
works have so far been registered with an estimated total capital
of 1.5 billion Dollars, adding that when these projects are fully
launched they will provide job opportunities to 4,060 Ethiopians.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President, U.N. Chief Discuss Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides today discussed with new U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan the protracted Cyprus problem at a meeting in Davos,
Switzerland, Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation (CyBC) reported.
</P>
<P>
Clerides described as "excellent and constructive" the meeting,
which took place on the sidelines of the world economic forum.
</P>
<P>
They exchanged views on various aspects of the Cyprus problem,
and emphasized on what can be done to start a dialog between the
Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus, the president said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Annan accepted his view that talks for a
solution to the Cyprus problem should be well prepared for.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides added that proximity talks should start
and continue, to establish whether there are prospects for
face-to-face negotiations between himself and Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
The CyBC also quoted Annan as saying at a press conference in
Davos that there is a window of opportunity to solve the Cyprus
issue in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said he will urge both parties in the divided
nation to begin talks this year.
</P>
<P>
He noted presidential elections are to be held in Cyprus next
year and negotiations for Cyprus' European Union accession are
also expected to begin in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief stated he will insist on his efforts to
persuade the parties to begin face-to-face talks, noting this is
necessary because of a rise of tension on the island.
</P>
<P>
Annan also pointed out that the U.N. does not encourage the
build-up of arms in Cyprus, because it does not contribute to
reaching a settlement.
</P>
<P>
The Clerides-Annan meeting came amid tension on this eastern
Mediterranean island in the wake of Cypriot government decision to
buy Russian-made S-300 surface-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has threatened to take military action if the missiles
are deployed.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and seized 37 percent of the island following an Athens-backed
coup.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali
Abdullah Saleh arrived in Saudi Arabia today for talks on border
demarcation between the two countries and other bilateral issues.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait News Agency said negotiations between Saleh and Saudi
leaders on the border issue would be held in the Islamic holy city
of Mecca either tonight or Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two countries had been locked in border disputes in 1934,
but since February 1995 when a Memorandum of Understanding
concerning the solution of the border issues was concluded between
them, tensions have been eased and bilateral ties have been
improving.
</P>
<P>
Border demarcation negotiations have been conducted through
joint committees.
</P>
<P>
Saleh said in a recent statement that although the border
question remains one of the "most complicated issues in the
region, we are confident the two countries' political will would
overcome all pending issues in a brotherly spirit."
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed security and economic agreements last
year in efforts to boost bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time for the Yemeni President to visit Saudi
Arabia since the signing of the Memorandum of
Understanding. During his previous visit, he met Saudi Crown
Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz in Ramadan (Islamic fasting month)
in Mecca last year.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Saudi Arabia, the Yemeni President will
also discuss regional issues of common interest with the Saudi
leaders and perform the Umrah (minor pilgrimage).

<HEADLINE> Peru Government to Continue Talks with Guerrillas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori said today that his government will begin new talks with
guerrillas holding hostages in the Japanese embassy in Lima.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori said his government will contact the guerrillas to
begin the first new negotiations since talks between the two broke
off about two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after a two-hour summit between Fujimori
and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in a downtown hotel
in Toronto today.
</P>
<P>
"Both leaders have agreed to promote the commencement of
preliminary dialogues," Fujimori told a news conference after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori and Hashimoto arrived in the Canadian city of Toronto
Friday to discuss ways to resolve the hostage standoff. The
meeting was the first face-to-face encounter since the crisis
began 46 days ago.
</P>
<P>
On December 17, the Tupac Amaru guerrilas stormed the Japanese
embassy in Lima. They have since released most of the 500 hostages
they took, while still holding 72 captives.
</P>
<P>
Japan has been worried about the way the Peruvian government is
handling the standoff with leftist rebels and repeatedly urged
Fujimori to seek only a peaceful resolution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"President Fujimori has said he will do his utmost for a
peaceful solution of the problem," the Japanese prime minister was
quoted as saying by media reports here.
</P>
<P>
"Force will not be used. He reaffirmed that position,"
Hashimoto said. He also expressed his "full confidence in the
Peruvian government's handling of this incident."
</P>
<P>
However, the Peruvian president has ruled out releasing the 400
Tupac Amaru prisoners being held in Peruvian jails, a major demand
of the guerrilas.
</P>
<P>
"There will be absolutely no release of prisoners," Fujimori
said. "Potentially dangerous people will not simply threaten the
peace and security of Peru...We shall not release such people."
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Hashimoto and Fujimori met Canadian Prime
Minister Jean Chretien for lunch before flying home.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official on Hong Kong's Prosperity After July 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, SWITZERLAND, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The policy of "One
Country, Two Systems", the joint efforts of all Hong Kong
residents and the support of foreign investors are essential for
Hong Kong's prosperity and stability after its reunification with
the People's Republic of China on July 1, 1997, Vice Minister of
Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office under the State Council of
China Chen Ziying said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The principle of 'One Country, Two Systems' initiated by Deng
Xiaoping and used for Hong Kong means that on the precondition of
China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong,
the mainland of China will maintain the socialist system while
Hong Kong will continue to operate under its capitalist system
within the framework of one country," Chen said at a session on
the outlook for Hong Kong beyond July 1997 of the annual meeting
of the World Economic Forum in Davos.
</P>
<P>
"In other words, the socialist system and policies shall not be
practiced in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR),"
he explained.
</P>
<P>
Chen elaborated China's policies on Hong Kong after July 1,
1997 in the following five points:
</P>
<P>
- Upon the return of Hong Kong to China, the Chinese government
will firmly adhere to the policies of "Hong Kong people
administering Hong Kong" and "Hong Kong SAR will enjoy a high
degree of autonomy". Except for foreign and defense affairs which
are the responsibilities of China's central government, the Hong
Kong SAR will be vested with executive, legislative and
independent judicial power including that of the final
adjudication.
</P>
<P>
- The status of Hong Kong in the World Trade Organization (WTO)
remains guaranteed in post 1997, whether or not China has become a
member of the WTO. Trade between the Hong Kong SAR and the
mainland will be deemed as international trade. The monetary and
financial relations between the Hong Kong SAR and the mainland
will be regulated entirely according to the international
practice. Mainland enterprises in the Hong Kong SAR shall enjoy no
privileges.
</P>
<P>
- The current judicial system and principles, for instance, the
principle of trial by jury, shall continue to be practiced in Hong
Kong. In other words, laws protecting overseas investors in Hong
Kong shall remain unchanged after the establishment of the Hong
Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
- The Hong Kong SAR will develop democracy in a gradual and
orderly way. One of the Chinese basic policies towards Hong Kong
is that the government of the Hong Kong SAR shall be composed
entirely of local inhabitants and the legislature of the Hong Kong
SAR shall be constituted by election. These constitutional
arrangements will evolve gradually and orderly until they reach
the ultimate goal when both the Chief Executive and the
legislature will be chosen by universal suffrage.
</P>
<P>
- In addition to the legal guarantee for continued prosperity
and stability in Hong Kong provided for by the Basic Law and the
"One Country, Two Systems" policy, Hong Kong's economic
development after 1997 will continue to enjoy the unique advantage
of easy access to the outside world and strong backing of the
Chinese mainland. Hong Kong's close relations with the European
and North American regions in financial and trade fields, and the
economic growth in the Asian and Pacific region will also instill
new vigor into Hong Kong as an international financial, trade and
shipping center.

<HEADLINE> Air Crash in Senegal Kills 20, Mostly French </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Twenty people, most of them
French tourists, were killed this afternoon in a plane crash in
southeast Senegal, according to the latest reports from the west
African country, confirmed by the French Foreign Ministry this
evening.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-two others were wounded, several of them seriously, in
the crash of the British-made Hawker Siddeley 748 passenger plane,
which crashed soon after taking off at 15:30 local time (14:30
GMT) from the airport of Tambacounda, 400 kilometers southeast of
the Senegalese capital Dakar.
</P>
<P>
"The embassy of France has in its hand information from
Senegalese sources on the people who died or were wounded on board
this plane, and they are in majority from France," said the
foreign ministry, which has opened a telephone number for
relatives of the possible victims.
</P>
<P>
The plane, which belonged to the Air Senegal air company and
was flying to Dakar from a big regional hunting center near
Tambacounda, broke into two parts after crashing into a field at
the outskirt of the airport.
</P>
<P>
All the 18 passengers in the front part of the plane, including
two of its pilots, were killed as it exploded, while those in the
rear part of the plane survived and were transported to Dakar for
medical emergency treatment by a Fokker military aircraft of the
Senegalese army.
</P>
<P>
Although the cause for the air incident is undecided yet, AFP
said that the plane, which caught fire in the sky and failed to
take altitude, was apparently over-loaded with passengers.
</P>
<P>
The over-heating weather could also have contributed to the
crash.
</P>
<P>
The airline between Tambacounda and Dakar is opened each year
between December to April of the next year, which coincides with

<HEADLINE> Swaziland Trade Union Reaffirms Commitment to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Swaziland Federation of
Trade Union (SFTU) officials today reaffirmed their commitment to
proceed with a national strike next Monday, an informed source
has said.
</P>
<P>
Dennis Fruhwirth, a leading member of the banned opposition
People's United Democratic Movement (PUDEMO), said SFTU leaders met
secretly on Saturday after their Secretary-General Jan Sithole and
three other top officials in the union were arrested on Friday.
</P>
<P>
PUDEMO is a close ally of the SFTU, which has called the strike
to put pressure on the government to repeal legislation banning
political parties and write a democratic constitution for Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
The SFTU would issue a statement on Sunday calling on its members to
observe the scheduled strike which was designed to force King Mswati
III to agree to multi-party democracy, Fruhwirth said.
</P>
<P>
Swazi Prime Minister Sibusiso Dlamini on Thursday urged SFTU
leaders to call off the planned strike. Meanwhile, the Swazi armed
forces have also been mobilized to set up roadblocks on major streets
as preemptive measures against the two-day strike.
</P>
<P>
The Kingdom of Swaziland, a deeply conservative traditional African
monarchy, has been banning activities of political parties in the
country since 1973. enditem

<HEADLINE> Egypt Allows Foreigners to Build Airports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will allow domestic and
foreign investors to build and manage airports in the country
under new legislation designed to encourage investment, the
Egyptian MENA news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The bill approved by the country's People's Assembly (Egyptian
parliament) today allows local and foreign investors to build and
operate the airports before they hand the facilities over to the
Egyptian government under a Build-Operate-and-Transfer program.
</P>
<P>
But the program does not stipulate how long the operation can
last.
</P>
<P>
The bill was approved in principle on January 20.
</P>
<P>
As foreign investment has become a major force giving Egypt's
economic momentum, the government has put forward a string of
investor-friendly policies.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment added up to no more than 400,000
U.S. dollars annually in the first half of this decade, when the
country's reform program was in its cradle.
</P>
<P>
However, during the first 20 days of this year, the Investment
Authority has approved 140 investment projects, with a total
capital of nearly 700,000 U.S. dollars and investment of 1.62
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The investment projects operating in Egypt have totaled 5,183,
with 14.4 billion dollars in capital and 27.4 billion dollars in
investment costs, according to official figures.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Minister: Political Dialog Possible in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Minister of Cabinet
Affairs Salaheddin Karar has said the door to dialog between the
government and the opposition in Sudan is open.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published on the Bahraini newspaper Al-Ayam
today, Karar pointed out all the political sides involved in the
current crisis should sit together and work out a solution.
</P>
<P>
Other issues can be referred to the Sudanese people for
decision through a referendum, he said, adding that the government
is ready to hold such a referendum.
</P>
<P>
"The problem lies in the agendas offered by both the government
and the opposition, as either side turns down the agenda offered
by the other," Karar said.
</P>
<P>
The minister turned down the allegation that the northern
opposition forces resorted to the military option because the
government had closed the door to reconciliation and dialog.
</P>
<P>
He said there is an attempt with the support of foreign
countries to separate southern Sudan and set up a secessionist
state in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese minister added that Ethiopia, Eritrea and Israel
are involved in the military attacks launched against Sudan by the
southern opposition forces led by John Garang since mid-January.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has also accused its neighbors Ethiopia and Eritrea of
invading Sudanese territory and backing the opposition offensives
in eastern Sudan. But Addis Ababa and Asmara have denied any such
involvement.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Sudanese government charged Israel with being
behind a conspiracy with the United States to topple the Islamic
system in Khartoum.

<TEXT>
<P>
According to the latest official statistics, China now boasts
47,000 garment companies which annually produces 8.5 billion
pieces of clothes. In 1995, the retail sales volume of garments
was over 11 percent of the total commodities' volume in the
market, and in 1996, the figure surpassed 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some high and middle-income consumers have begun to be
attracted to the brand names and quality clothes. Therefore, some
imported world-famed brands, including Pierre Cardin and Goldlion,
began to open specialized shops or counters, and their products
sell well in many cities.
</P>
<P>
As for some low-paid people, the inexpensive and substantial
clothes are still their priority of choice, but some of them have
started to pay more attention to the colors and styles of the
clothes in a bid to dress themselves better and more attractive.
</P>
<P>
With regard to materials, 88.7 percent of consumers tend to be
fond of natural materials like cotton, linen, wool and silk in
order to seek the feeling of natural comfort, according to a
recent survey by the State Information Center and the State
Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
To date, thousands of Chinese magazines and newspapers have run
special columns on fashions, as a way to teach people how to dress
properly.
</P>
<P>
And since 1986, the China Fashion Research Institute has given
regular briefings on fashion trends and an increasing number of
Chinese fashion designers have become more mature in setting the
fashions.
</P>
<P>
"All these will inevitably have positive impact on the future
Chinese way of dressing," Wang Hua said.

<HEADLINE> New Israeli Treatment Saves Diabetic Foot From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 2 (Xinhua) -- A new treatment method
developed in Israel can effectively help prevent arterial
clogging and subsequently save many diabetic feet from amputation,
a clinic spokesman announced today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman of Diabetic Foot Clinic in Ramat Gan, Israel,
said the method involves a precise location of the clogging by
means of a highly sophisticated ultrasound equipment before an
artery-dilating cocktail of four drugs is injected and free
blood-flow is enabled.
</P>
<P>
Doctors say that diabetic foot syndrome is the most common
complication of diabetes. Diabetics are 17 times more likely to
develop gangrene due to artery clogging and 85 percent of major
amputations in the U.S. are done on diabetics.
</P>
<P>
One of the most challenging problems to deal with when treating
diabetic foot syndrome are the persisting harsh pains despite good
diabetic control.
</P>
<P>
These pains are treated up to now, first with medication that,
when fails, is replaced by surgical treatment which eventually
leads to amputation.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Olshanyesky initially developed the new method for
male impotence and later applied it on leg arteries.
</P>
<P>
Olshanyesky described the method as a "revolutionary approach"
and said it has proved valid.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Promotes Wetlands Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has made progress in
protecting its wetlands since an international convention on
wetlands was ratified by the country in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The convention, an inter-governmental treaty launched at
Ramsar, Iran, on February 2, 1971, partly aims to the
conservation of wetlands as habitats for migratory water birds
and enhance international cooperation in the field.
</P>
<P>
The day, adopted by a conference on wetlands held in Brisbane,
Austria in March 1996 as World Wetlands Day, was marked with a
theme "Wetlands and Community" in Masaka District, 120 kilometers
southwest of capital Kampala today.
</P>
<P>
In compliance with the convention, Uganda has made efforts to
raise awareness of the public about uses of wetlands and the need
of conservation.
</P>
<P>
The country has also developed a national wetlands policy,
including the designation of Lake George's wetland, southwestern
Uganda as a convention site, the research and evaluation of
wetlands for facilitating their wise use.
</P>
<P>
The authorities, in February, 1996, set up a hot line for the
public to report environment abuse and announced that new
draining of swamps for economic development is no longer allowed
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Netherlands offered Uganda funds for restoring
some swamps in the country.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's wetlands cover an area of about 29,600 square
kilometers and make for 12 percent of the country's territory.
</P>
<P>
The wetlands play a role as filters of waste before it drains
into lakes and rivers in the eastern African country.
</P>
<P>
However, Uganda's wetlands has decreased in acreage, mainly
due to human activities including grazing, brick-making, reduced
vegetation, rice planting and hunting especially of antelopes and
water birds.
</P>
<P>
Large tracts of wetlands in the country currently have been
drained into paddy fields.
</P>
<P>
In Kampala and Kabale District bordering on Rwanda, many
swampy areas have been drained for farming and house
construction. enditem

<HEADLINE> Hainan Makes Progress with Aid-The-Poor Programme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The southern most province of
Hainan has made fresh progress in combining exploiting resources
with developing the economy of poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Since Hainan Province was established in 1988, the provincial
government has put 50.8 million yuan (6.12 million US dollars) in
aiding 3897 projects in poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
By now, people in 64 percent of the poverty-stricken areas have
come to use electricity, and 68 percent of such areas have
highways.
</P>
<P>
An official with the provincial government said that the
average income of per person in the poverty-stricken areas was
24.4 percent higher than 1995.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, about 150,000 people in Hainan Province have escaped
poverty. Five state-aided poverty-stricken counties and 89
province-aided such counties have escaped poverty.
</P>
<P>
For 1997, the provincial government has drawn up new
programs. For example, enterprises and better developed localities
will be called on to invest in the poor areas, as a step to
achieve the goal of helping the remaining 450,000 people in the
province escape poverty by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Lose 18 Million Dollars on Cocoa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is expected to lose an
average of 18 million U.S. Dollars a year from the export of poor
quality cocoa, representing a loss of 10 percent in annual
revenue from the product.
</P>
<P>
Cocoa was prominent as the singular most important non-oil
foreign exchange earner in Nigeria before its marketing was
privatized in January 1987, the Guardian newspaper reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the privatization, the exclusive exporter of cocoa
was the Nigerian Cocoa Board, Mustapha Balagun, an official in
the Ministry of Commerce and Tourism, said at a meeting on
improving cocoa marketing here over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The agency was also authorized to fix cocoa prices on a
seasonal basis and to specify quality, so as to eliminate risks
of price fluctuations, guaranteeing export quality as well as
sound export performance, said Balagun.
</P>
<P>
"Consequent upon this performance, the international cocoa
community has confidence in Nigeria cocoa which has good flavor
and aroma," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Nigerian cocoa sold at a premium at the terminal
market, just as it is easy for the board to meet international
and local requirements in terms of data and other relevant
information.
</P>
<P>
However, the liberalization process aimed at promoting
efficiency has created troubles such as deteriorating product
quality, fluctuating prices and over-reliance on the spot market.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it became impossible to take advantage of forward
sales due to the instability of prices.
</P>
<P>
Efforts made in the past three years to enhance the quality of
cocoa in the country have yet to restore the country's premium
position, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
The country should take top measures on the training of
farmers and practitioners and the strengthening of both private
and public bodies engaged in certifying cocoa quality, he said.

<HEADLINE> China's Capital to Boost Service Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- A vice-mayor of Beijing has
stressed the importance of developing the service industry in
China's capital city.
</P>
<P>
Lu Yucheng said that Beijing, as the country's capital, enjoys
a solid foundation in the service sector. "Therefore, more efforts
should be made to develop it into a pillar industry," Lu noted.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show the city received 2.189 million overseas
travelers last year, raking in 2.25 billion US dollars, up 5.7
percent and 3.3 percent respectively over 1995.
</P>
<P>
The year 1996 saw 4,500 people from the city going abroad for
labor export, bringing in 430 million dollars, advancing 12.5
percent and 30.3 percent over the previous year, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The city's Great Wall Corporation has been listed as one of the
225 biggest contractors in the world. The city's designing and
constructing capability is listed top grade in the country, said
an official with the municipal government.

<HEADLINE> Clothing in China: From Patched, Pompous To Casual (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Ms Zhang, 31, with 40 pieces of
quality seasonal clothes, always finds difficulty to decide what
to wear the next day. She would have to clothe herself according
to the weather and the place she goes.
</P>
<P>
But in her girlhood, or one and half decades ago, she could
only wrap herself in blue or grey "Mao suits", sometimes with
patches, not to say of personal favor.
</P>
<P>
Zhang likes to divide her clothes into two parts, with the
serious ones for work, and the casual for leisure. Thus, she would
have casualwear at home and dress with personality and personal
flavor when she goes out, a fashion of the time.
</P>
<P>
"I can afford it now," she said with a sense of pride after a
glance of her full wardrobe. As a company account in Beijing, she
has a monthly salary of some 1,000 yuan (about 120 US dollars), a
sign of the better-off life in China with its 1.2 billion
population.
</P>
<P>
In Chinese cities and towns, now it is quite common for a woman
or girl to have a dozen or more pieces of clothes in their
wardrobe. Even a man or boy would have different kinds of dresses
for a single season.
</P>
<P>
Tremendous changes have taken place in the Chinese way of
dressing since the reform and open policy started in 1978.
</P>
<P>
However, any Chinese, aged above 30, might share the experience
of having very few pieces of single-colored clothes, usually blue
or grey "Mao suits", for all seasons. She or he would wash and dry
the dirty clothes to prepare for the next-day wear.
</P>
<P>
Wang Hua, a noted fashion designer and the author of the
country's first fashion book, said, "The prerequisite of the
people's dressing changes lies in the huge manufacturing capacity
of the fashion sector and the vast sales networks in the country."
</P>
<P>
When the people's dress aims not only to shelter and warm up
their body, the personality, quality and diversity are the natural
goals they are after, Wang added.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The city government of
Zhengzhou, the capital of central China's Henan Province, recently
invited overseas businessmen to evaluate the work of government
departments responsible for foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of more than 80 overseas-funded companies
commented on over 20 administrative offices, such as commercial,
industrial, land-use, taxation, telecommunications, and legal
administrative bodies.
</P>
<P>
According to 83 survey sheets collected, businessmen said they
were basically satisfied with local officials in implementing laws
and policies and the simplicity of procedures related to foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
One Singaporean entrepreneur praised the action, saying that it
could help in understanding foreign investors' attitudes towards
the local government's work, and that it is a way to supervise the
government.
</P>
<P>
Local officials who organized the evaluation explained that the
survey is a way for the city government to improve the local
investment environment. He noted that, "at least, it will let
government departments know what kind of help foreign businessmen
want and what they can do to improve things in the future."
</P>
<P>
Zhengzhou is an open city with business people from 45
countries investing in local industries, agriculture, real estate
and infrastructures, according to the officials.

deemed as precious as the giant panda. The United Nations
designated it as a rare and endangered species in 1973.
</P>
<P>
China spent several million yuan building Yangtze alligator
protection zones in Anhui Province in 1983, a main habitat of the
animal. China Yangtze Alligator Research Center was also set up,
and local people were mobilized to help rescue the alligators.
</P>
<P>
Breakthroughs have been made in breeding the alligators,
according to Xie Wanshu, director of the research center. At
present, the success rate of artificial breeding has reached over
60 percent, with a survival rate of up to 95 percent.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, the Yangtze Alligator Breeding and
Research Center of Anhui has shipped more than 100 alligators to
over a dozen zoos around the country. The second generation of the
alligators have been allowed for international trade.

<HEADLINE> S. Arabia, Yemen to Finalize Border Demarcation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia and Yemen will
finalize their border demarcation as soon as possible, according
to a statement made after Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh
ended his visit to the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The statement, released by the Saudi Press Agency following
talks between Saudi Arabian King Fahd and visiting Yemeni
President Saleh Saturday night, confirmed that the two leaders
agreed in talks held in Saudi holy city of Makkah on finalizing
the demarcation of the remaining part of common borders.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to continue consultations in a bid to
bolster bilateral relations on solid basis that serve the
security and stability of their peoples, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Saleh arrived in Saudi Red Sea coast city of Jeddah Saturday,
concluded his two-day visit this morning and left for home.
</P>
<P>
The two countries had been locked in border disputes since
1934, but since February 1995 when a Memorandum of
Understanding concerning the solution of the border issues was
concluded between them, tension was eased and bilateral ties
have been improved.
</P>
<P>
Border demarcation negotiations have been conducted through
joint committees formed in accordance with the Memorandum of
Understanding which was signed according to the 1934 Taif
Agreement and defines the basis for ending the border dispute
between the two neighbors on the Arab peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum also stipulates that the demarcation of the
borders not covered by the Taif Agreement should be completed.
</P>
<P>
Saleh said in a recent statement that although the border
question remains one of the "most complicated issues in the
region, we are confident the two countries' political will
would overcome all pending issues in a brotherly spirit."
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed security and economic agreements
last year in efforts to boost bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Economists, Entrepreneurs Call For Stronger Brandname Sense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese enterprises should
attach greater importance to the creation and protection of
brandnames, and China has suffered heavy losses due to the lack of
the sense.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing campaign to promote domestic brandname products is
the best way to protect the national industry.
</P>
<P>
These were remarked by over 100 local economists and
entrepreneurs at the '97 Economists and Entrepreneurs Get-Together
which began on Friday evening in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference National Committee Wan Guoquan and President of the
Chinese Trade Mark Association Liu Minxue were present at the
gathering.
</P>
<P>
The participants pointed out that in recent years, many foreign
products have successfully entered into the Chinese market through
the adoption of the brandname strategy, and meanwhile, local
products have kepted on withdrawing and many of them have failed
to protect their share of the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Showing their worry about the current situation, the speakers
expressed the hope that more and more Chinese enterprises should
pay greater attention to the issue.
</P>
<P>
To adopt the brandname strategy is a significant means to
change the mode of economic growth, which will be helpful for
improving the quality of economic operation, optimizing the
structure of products. Moreover, it will reinforce the ties of the
Chinese economy and the world economy and improve the status and
image of the country, according to the participants.
</P>
<P>
They further noted that brandname represents the whole quality
of an enterprise and is an important symbol of the viability of a
firm, and consequently, the issue is directly related to the
survival of an enterprise. And the attitude of an entrepreneur
towards the issue of brandname also reflects his own quality.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu Ji, Director of the Beijing Advertizers' Club,
to develop brandnames and create brandnames have gradually become
a topic among domestic economists and entrepreneurs. She said her
club had sponsored the meeting to bring economists and
entrepreneurs together to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
The club plans to make the gathering an annual event so as to
promote the implementation of the country's brandname strategy,
she said.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Enjoys Stable Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Tibetan farmers and herdsmen
earned an average income of 960 yuan last year, up 9.3 percent
over 1995, according to latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
The year witnessed the ninth consecutive harvest in the Tibet
Autonomous Region, as overall output of grain is estimated to
reach 770,000 tons, increasing by 7 percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of good weather, governments at all levels
increased financial and technological input in the sector,
investing 300 million yuan, up by 13.53 million yuan over 1995. As
a result, farming conditions were improved, with more practical
techniques and fine seeds used.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the regional government raised its purchasing price
of grain, a move that resulted in farmers' enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
Last year also witnessed rapid growth of the husbandry sector,
with the total output of meat in the region reaching 112,000 tons,
and that of wool 8,600 tons, according to statistics.
</P>
<P>
Another important source of the Tibetans' income was township
enterprises, whose output value reached 350 million yuan in 1996,
up 18.6 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Also, the regional government paid close attention to poverty
elimination work, launching 102 aide-the-poor projects last year
with an overall input of more than 300 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, another 120,000 people were lifted out
of poverty, figures show.

<HEADLINE> Cost of Living High in Nigerian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The mass relocation of civil
servants from Lagos to Abuja late last year has made life in the
new federal capital more difficult as the cost of living has
risen to an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying the price hikes is the unprecedented rise of
advance-fee fraud, pickpockets and prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
All Nigeria's ministries and parastatals had moved their
headquarters from the former capital of Lagos to Abuja before the
end of October last year.
</P>
<P>
Following the inflow of civil servants, the cost of
accommodation, which is very difficult to get at present, has
risen out of control in the city.
</P>
<P>
Survey shows that six months ago, a two-bedroom flat could be
obtained at 100,000 to 150,000 Naira (about 1,250 to 1,875 U.S.
Dollars) per year. The price has recently doubled or more.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of accommodation has also triggered "Abuja
marriages" so called by local residents. In an Abuja marriage,
opposite sexes agree to live in a room or flat and share
everything in common in the apartment.
</P>
<P>
Among most affected by the accommodation trouble are lower
grade civil servants whose branches could not secure sufficient
accommodation for its work force.
</P>
<P>
Those who were offered accommodation but could not relocate
with their families now have to in turn rent out parts of the
official quarters to the unfortunate ones at a price for a
self-contained apartment in the posh area of Lagos.
</P>
<P>
Some of governmental staff currently sleep in their offices or
lodge in hotels on governmentt accounts.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government issued a circular to stop governmental
bodies from lodging their staff in hotels without pre-paying
bills in last June following media reports that it had owed three
luxury hotels in Abuja 290 million Naira (3.6 million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, the governmental debts to the hotels rose to one
billion Naira (12.5 million Dollars) at the end of November.
</P>
<P>
The hotels, in hopes for maintaining good relations with the
government, their biggest patron, refuses to tell which
ministries are in the debt.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Ministry of Finance said some of these bills
are so large that they have to be paid with the approval of the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
So far no reports are available about how the government will
deal with the mounting debt it owed to the hotels.

<HEADLINE> Dialogue Likely Underway Between EU, Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Moves to resolve the strained
relations between Nigeria and the 15-member European Union (EU)
may be underway, the Sunday Champion newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Relations between EU and Nigeria soured after the EU imposed
punitive measures on the western African country in 1993 and
1995.
</P>
<P>
Netherlands, which has just assumed the presidency of the
Brussels-based body, has recently called for "constructive
dialogue" between EU and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Remco Van Wijngaarden, spokesman of the
Dutch Embassy in Nigeria, as saying that it is believed that
whatever differences that have arisen between the two sides can
be resolved through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"There have been issues in which Nigeria and the EU do not
agree and we believe that in order to make progress on these
issues there should be constructive dialogue," he said when
unfolding the EU programs for 1997.
</P>
<P>
On the sanctions imposed by EU on Nigeria, Wijngaarden
expressed regret that there had been what he called "a
misunderstanding in the Nigerian press."
</P>
<P>
He described as "absolutely untrue" the impression that EU
extended the scope of sanctions imposed on Nigeria in the EU
ministerial meeting on November 25, 1996.
</P>
<P>
EU sanctions, banning all military cooperation between EU
members and Nigeria, started in 1993 following the annulment of
the June 12, 1993 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Between November 20 and December 4, 1995, EU adopted a common
position on a number of additional measures, including limited
visa restrictions and halt of development of cooperation,
following the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa.
</P>
<P>
Exempted from the suspension are programs supporting human
rights and democracy as well as those that border on humanitarian
ground like poverty alleviation and, in particular, the provision
of basic needs for the poorest section of the population.
</P>
<P>
The leadership of the country's five political parties have
proposed a tour to Europe, especially Brussels that houses EU
headquarters, in a bid to muster European supports for the
current transition to civil rule.
</P>
<P>
The chairmen of the five political parties ended an 18-day
pro-transition program enlightenment tour of the United States
last month.

URUMQI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- In 1996, 210,000 people in
Xinjiang shirked off poverty, thus achieving local authorities'
set target to help 164,000 people get rid of poverty in the year.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, more than 1.7 million people in the
autonomous region have been freed from the burden of poverty.
</P>
<P>
The development of agriculture has served as a "point of
breakthrough" in poverty relief work. In 1996, the per capita
income in the poverty-stricken areas increased by one-fifth thanks
to agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
Last year, grain output of the 30 poor counties in the region
exceeded 1.8 million tons, while both cotton output and meat
produce reached 150,000 tons, bringing gross agricultural output
value to 8.2 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Local governments at different levels have worked out policies
to advance the development of the poverty-affected areas. More
than 120 government departments are involved in poverty relief
work.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Renews Warning of Israeli Settlement Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Presidential Political
Adviser Osama al-Baz said today that the Israeli settlements in
the occupied lands threaten to torpedo the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish settlements tend to dim the peace prospects because
every time Israel enlarges its settlements and colonies, the
problem becomes bigger and hopes for proceeding seriously on the
peace march dwindle, he said in an exclusive interview with Voice
of Arab radio.
</P>
<P>
In their latest move to expand settlements, Jewish settlers in
Hebron dug foundations for apartments in preparation for the
expansion of an enclave in the Israeli-ruled part of the West Bank
town Thursday.
</P>
<P>
David Wilder, a spokesman for the 400 Jews who live or study in
Hebron, said they planned to construct apartments for about 10
families and that building permits had either been issued or
promised by Israeli authorities.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Israel has further upset the Palestinians
with a military decree prohibiting Palestinians from renovating
Arab home near Jewish enclaves in Hebron. But the Palestinians
have vowed to pursue their renovation works.
</P>
<P>
Baz told the radio that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will
inform Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu of the Egyptian
view that the agreements signed with the Palestinian side should
be implemented to the letter.
</P>
<P>
Baz underscored the need to resume the negotiations on both the
Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese tracks from where they were
suspended.
</P>
<P>
On the speech Mubarak will deliver today at the Davos Forum,
Baz said that speech will dwell on Egypt's views regarding the new
economic situation in the world, the experiment of the Egyptian
economic reform besides issues of security and stability in the
Middle East region.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Orders to Look into Dumping of Toxic Wastes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today ordered two government departments to look into reports that
tons of hospital wastes were being dumped daily into the Pasig
River, the biggest waterway running across Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
Ramos issued the directive to Environment and Natural Resources
Secretary Victor Ramos and Health Secretary Carmencita Reodica. He
also directed them to give him a feedback not later than February
6.
</P>
<P>
Ramos was reacting to a revelation by industrial pollution
expert Manuel Gloria on the unchecked dumping of toxic and
hazardous wastes into the river, said a Presidential Palace
statement.
</P>
<P>
Gloria said in a recent research paper that the Pasig River
basin was not only a catchment for untreated sewerage and
industrial wastes but also a dump site for infectious wastes.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that the toxic wastes thrown daily into the river
by hospitals and clinics in Metro Manila at 4,600 kilograms,
accounting for some 45 percent of the total effluents dumped into
the river every day.

<HEADLINE> China Establishes First Dolphin Protection Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The first white-flag dolphin
protection center in China has been established in east China's
Zhenjiang city to care for the animal on the lower reaches of the
Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The white-flag dolphin, found only in China and under priority
protection by the state, is one of the six types of fresh-water
dolphins still surviving on the earth. The past decade has
witnessed the unexpected death of 59 dolphins, according to
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that the total number of white-flag dolphins
alive is less than 200, far below that of the giant panda. With
less-than-enough attention paid to protection, people might see
the extinction of the species in 25 to 100 years, they said.
</P>
<P>
"It is extremely urgent to save the animal, as it is so rare
now," noted an expert.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing Normal University and the Zhenjiang city government
have launched a serious of protection projects to save the
dolphin, and tests for artificial breeding has been carried out,
though without any breakthroughs yet.
</P>
<P>
The newly-established center is expected to make protection
work more scientific, systematic and regular, said a provincial
government official.
</P>
<P>
Chinese biologists have vowed not to let the animal die out in
their lifetime.

<HEADLINE> Strained Nigerian-Canadian Ties Delay Bitumen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian-Canadian relations,
soured by Canada's tough stance for further sanctions on the
western African country, has led to the standstill for a
multi-billion-U.S.-Dollar bitumen project in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Although related preliminary studies have been completed out
in Ondo, Edo and Ogun states, southwestern Nigeria, for several
months, the Canadian firm called Jerez Energy Incorporated (JEI)
is yet to get a prospecting licence by the Nigerian government.
</P>
<P>
JEI, starting its operation in the area about three years ago,
had spent over 1.5 million Dollars on the project by the end of
1996. It has paid more than 250,000 Dollars as compensation for
crops it destroyed, the Guardian newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
The company has applied for a prospecting license to the
Ministry of Solid Minerals Development, but there is no response
from the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Due to the delay of the issue of license, the firm could not
commence the second phase project aimed at whether to construct a
refinery or a 180 kilometer-long pipeline to run parallel to the
Escravos-Lagos national gas pipeline.
</P>
<P>
It could not drill another 20 bitumen wells in Nigeria too,
although it has drilled 11 bitumen wells in the areas where there
are an estimated 770 million barrels of recoverable reserves.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Nigeria and Canada became strained in
November 1995, following the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight
others by the Nigerian military government.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth has since suspended Nigeria's membership and
imposed sanctions and Canada has been putting pressures on the
body for further sanctions with a vow to do so itself when its
call was turned down.
</P>
<P>
As a response, Nigeria closed its high commission in Canada
last September.
</P>
<P>
Bitumen has been the bone of road construction in Nigeria,
whose present consumption level of bitumen stands at 150,000
barrels a year according to official data.

<HEADLINE> HK Newspaper Hails Preparatory Committee Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The documents adopted at the
eighth plenum of the Preparatory Committee, which ended yesterday
in Beijing, reflected the principle of "Hong Kong people governing
 Hong Kong", a local newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
An editorial carried by Ta Kung Pao hailed the two-day session
as "very important and fruitful", saying the meeting signaled that
 the work of the Preparatory Committee has achieved major progress.
</P>
<P>
The two decisions and one suggestion are about questions that
have drawn much attention of the Hong Kong people and that concern
 the smooth preparation of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR) government and its effective operation after July
1.
</P>
<P>
The decision empowering the first Chief Executive and the
Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) of the HKSAR to start their
work before June 30 was adopted by the session after receiving
advice of some local residents, and it gave full support for the
Chief Executive and the PLC to carry out their work, the editorial
 said.
</P>
<P>
The decision on the establishment of provisional regional
organizations will enable them to play a role in serving the
communities and will aid the smooth transition, it added.
</P>
<P>
According to the suggestion on how to handle the original laws
of Hong Kong, of the more than 600 Hong Kong ordinances and over
1,000 subordinate legislative items, only 14 ordinances and
subordinate legislative items and part of 11 other ordinances and
subordinate legislation will not be adopted by the HKSAR, the
editorial said.
</P>
<P>
This conformed to the spirit that the original Hong Kong laws
remain basically unchanged, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The editorial continued to point out that the documents shared
a distinctive characteristic, that is, full respect of the high
degree of autonomy of the HKSAR and full backing for the Chief
Executive to exercise his rights.
</P>
<P>
So Mr. Tung Chee Hwa was very glad to tell a press conference
after the meeting that the documents passed at the session embody
the spirit of "one country, two systems", "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong" and high degree of autonomy, the editorial
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the local newspapers, such as Wen Wei Po, Oriental
Daily News and Sing Tao Daily, gave wide coverage of the
Preparatory Committee meeting.

NEW DELHI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Indian Agriculture Minister

interest while honoring commitments to reducing import

Though the government is committed to reducing restrictions as

see that there is no adverse impact on the country's farmers, the

<P>
The government has constituted a high level committee to look
into the entire gamut of issues involved in the reduction of
import restrictions, Mishra said.

"The Indian farmers are not looking for doles. The basic
guarantees of easy and timely availability of credit, seeds,

<HEADLINE> Minister on Wetland Protection on Wetlands' Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Xu Youfang, the Minister of
Forestry, delivered a written statement today to mark the first
"International Wetlands' Day" designated by the international
wetlands organization.
</P>
<P>
He vowed in the statement that China will make further efforts
in the protection of wetland resources.
</P>
<P>
Wetlands, a kind of important natural ecological system and
known as the earth's "kidney", play an unreplaceable role in
climate adjusting, water conserving, soil-erosion preventing and
pollutant resolving in addition to serving as habitats for a
variety of the world's rare water fowls.
</P>
<P>
China has a total area of more than 25 million hectares of
natural and artificial wetlands of different types scattered
across the country, with many being waterfowl habitats of
international importance.
</P>
<P>
"History has told us that the protection of wetlands represents
the protection of ourselves, for the destruction of wetlands means
the destruction of man's living environment," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Xu said his Ministry will launch a drive to enhance the
awareness of wetland protection among the public, establish a
dynamic monitoring network and information system for China's
wetlands, conduct scientific research in wetland protection as
well as proper utilization and management of wetlands resources.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, China has set up more than 130 wetland nature
reserves, six of which have been listed as of "international
importance", according to the minister.

<HEADLINE> Work of HK SAR Provisional Legislative Council Outlined (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Rita Fan, newly-elected
president of the Provisional Legislative Council of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), has mapped out a blueprint
for the provisional legislature before and after July 1.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua during the Eighth Plenary Session
of the Preparatory Committee for the HK SAR, which closed here on
Saturday, she said the provisional legislature will faced with
arduous tasks, which involves some sensitive problems.
</P>
<P>
However, she said that she has the full confidence in doing the
work well.
</P>
<P>
Rita Fan went on say that the Provisional Legislative Council
is the first legislative body of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
Before June 30, she noted, her council will examine and approve
laws that are indispensable to guarantee the normal operation of
the HK SAR.
</P>
<P>
From July 1 this year to mid-1998 when the first Legislative
Council of the HK SAR is established, it will attend to the
matters which are urgently required to be dealt with, including
the formulation of a law for electing the Legislative Council of
the future HK SAR.
</P>
<P>
A panel of the Preparatory Committee will undertake to consider
this law for election, she said.
</P>
<P>
Rita Fan noted that before June 30, the Provisional Legislative
Council will, among others, enact a law for issuing passports of
the Hong Kong SAR and a law for protection of regional flags and
emblems and give a definition of permanent Hong Kong residents.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, she added, it will approve namelist of judges of the
Court of Final Appeal and the Chief Judge of the High Court to be
nominated by the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR and draft a
bill on the provisional district parliaments.
</P>
<P>
Rita Fan said the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR will
appoint a number of new provisional district organizations. The
original Hong Kong three-tiers parliaments, comprising the
Legislative Council, urban and municipal councils and district
boards, shall be terminated on June 30. This is because the law
base for their existence originates from the law system of the
British rule over Hong Kong, whose validity will vanish on June
30.

<TEXT>
<P>
On the working method for the provisional legislature, Rita Fan
said that it will firstly discuss, amend, and examine various
kinds of draft documents handed down by the office of the Chief
Executive. The documents will be defined and approved after all
members of the provisional legislature swear into office and then
will become valid and made public for implementation with the
Chief Executive's signature.
</P>
<P>
She said the preparatory work is being done by the Provisional
Legislative Council for formulating laws. But the whole
legislative procedures will be completed and laws go into effect
at zero hour of July 1.
</P>
<P>
Rita Fan estimated that the first draft document is likely to
be completed by the office of the Chief Executive in later March.
</P>
<P>
Before later March, the main tasks for the provisional
legislature are to attend to some internal matters, she said.
</P>
<P>
-- To prepare to set up a special group to draft rules of
procedure in accordance with the provisions of the Basic Law on
the legislative bodies and the Decision on the Establishment of
the Provisional Legislative Council adopted by the Preparatory
Committee on March 24, 1996 and,
</P>
<P>
-- to set up another group to mainly consider executive
framework and other relevant matters.
</P>
<P>
The Plenary Session of the Provisional Legislative Council will
be held in Shenzhen, Rita Fan said. "I am now choosing an
appropriate site for holding meetings and considering the issue of
whether the office of the provisional legislature will be based in
Hong Kong or Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
She noted that some work that the provisional legislature is
doing is sensitive.
</P>
<P>
Though the task for the provisional legislature is arduous, she
said, "I believe that the task, entrusted to us by history, will
be smoothly accomplished, because Hong Kong is entering a new era
of the "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong".
</P>
<P>
Rita Fan quoted Deng Xiaoping as saying that Hong Kong will be
governed and managed well by the Hong Kong people.

BELGRADE, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. government
official said here today that the U.S.-proposed initiative for
southeast European cooperation aims to establish peace and
stabilization in the Balkan region, stressing that Yugoslavia
should be included in this initiative.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with "Evening News" in Zagreb, the capital of
Croatia, U.S special advisor to the President for National
Security Affairs and Secretary of State for the Southeast European
Cooperative Initiative Richard Schifter said that the U.S. wants
the southeast European countries to cooperate economically for
regional stabilization.
</P>
<P>
The initiative, not a new Marshall Plan, is to provide
technical and other aid to help economic development in this
region, he said, adding that the U.S. expects Europe's full
understanding to its initiative.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was designed for cooperation among the 12 Balkan
countries. But Macedonian and Croatian foreign ministers rejected
it Friday, saying there is no need to institutionalize the
initiative.
</P>
<P>
They believed cooperation among central and southeastern
European countries could be carried out on concrete programs
without a designated institution.
</P>
<P>
Critics in Croatia held that the U.S. goal behind the
initiative was to build a "United States of the Balkans."

<HEADLINE> 2 Killed in Jet Crash in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- A jet plane which is scheduled
to pick up Defense Secretary Renato de Villa crashed into a
forested mountain in the southern Philippines on Saturday
afternoon, killing two pilots, the Air Transportation Office said
today.
</P>
<P>
Artemio Garcia of the Air Transportation Office said that
rescue helicopters today spotted the wreckage of the jet earlier
declared missing near Medina town in Misamis Oriental province in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
He said before the crash, the aircraft was on its way to the
Cagayan de Oro city airport to refuel after dropping by Defense
Secretary Renato de Villa and his aides in Butuan city. It is
supposed to fly back to send the Defense Secretary to Manila.
</P>
<P>
Garcia said the plane's last radio contact with the airport
control tower was at 2.30 p.m. Saturday while it was 10,000 feet
above, some 49 miles northeast of the Cagayan de Oro city airport.
</P>
<P>
He said the crash could be caused by sheer error because the
pilot was apparently disoriented as to the location of the Cagayan
de Oro city airport.
</P>
<P>
"He mistook the mountain as the runway," Garcia said as he
referred to the pilot's error induced by the poor visibility in
the high sky.

after the announcement of the long-awaited Supreme Court verdict
this week.
</P>
<P>
The much-delayed court ruling upholding the dissolution of the
National Assembly and the dismissal of Benazir Bhutto's government
has put all speculation at rest, paving the way for the general
elections tomorrow which will be the fourth such exercise in eight
years in this South Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
Many of the political analysts here are of the view that the
coming elections will be a tough trial of strength among
Pakistan's major political parties despite the lack of carnival
atmosphere and traditional festivities.
</P>
<P>
According to figures provided by the Election Commission, a
total of 53 political parties and 902 independents are involved in
the election process. More than 1,860 candidates are contesting
the National Assembly seats and another 4,500 are contesting
Provincial Assembly seats.
</P>
<P>
It is believed, however, the Pakistan Muslim League led by
Nawaz Sharif--PML(N) and the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) led by
Benazir Bhutto still occupy the dominant positions in the
country's political arena. And the two have been playing the
leading role in the whole election process.
</P>
<P>
The PML(N), which has already formed an alliance with the
powerful Karachi-based Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM) and the
PPP(Shaheed Bhutto), a breakaway faction of the Pakistan People's
Party, is considered to be the most potential winner in the coming
elections.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts here believe that it is hard for the PML(N)
to win a simple majority of 109 seats in the National Assembly to
form a single-party government.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls by the local press show that the most likely
outcome is for the PML(N) to form a coalition central government
with the MQM, the PPP(SB), the Awami (People's) National Party and
independents after the February 3 polls.
</P>
<P>
The PPP has dominated Pakistani politics since the late 1960s
and has won as many as four general elections. However, things are
not looking too rosy this time. Many of the PPP senior members
have privately admitted that the elections could not have come at
a worse time.
</P>
<P>
It seems likely that the PPP led by Benazir will suffer severe
setbacks in some of the constituencies and will be affected by the
boycott of some religious parties.
</P>
<P>
Yet it is still believed to be a powerful vote snatcher and the
largest party in the opposition in the next government if the
PML(N) comes to power.
</P>
<P>
In any case, the bi-partisan politics will still be the
dominant feature in Pakistan's future state governance.
</P>
<P>
However, the two major political parties are facing tough
challenges this time from a number of new political entities, most
prominently, Imran Khan, chief of the Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaaf
(PTI), and Ghinwa Bhutto, head of the PPP(SB).
</P>
<P>
Imran Khan, Pakistan's former national cricket team captain,
founded the PTI last March. His branding of all traditional
politicians as corrupt and dishonest has, to some extent, won him
support among Pakistan's rapidly growing middle-class.
</P>
<P>
Though some of the analysts feel that the PTI may prove to be a
classic case of too much too soon despite its effective campaign
and timely slogans against corruption, it will pose a major threat
to the PML(N) in its power base of Punjab, the largest and most
populous province of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it is believed that the Benazir-led PPP will be
severely affected in its power base of Sindh Province by the
aggressive participation of the PPP(SB).
</P>
<P>
With Ghinwa Bhutto, widow of Benazir's brother Murtaza Bhutto,
leading the party, and caretaker Chief Minister Mumtaz Bhutto
providing considerable backing, the PPP(SB) is posing a big
challenge to the PPP's monopoly over rural areas in Sindh.
</P>
<P>
The PPP(SB)'s standing has risen sharply following the death of
Murtaza Bhutto last September in a suspicious police shoot-out,
with a large number of PPP dissidents jumping on its bandwagon in
a bid to make a political comeback.
</P>
<P>
The MQM, which boycotted the general elections in 1993 on the
accusation of government oppression, has quickly proved that its
popular base remains intact.
</P>
<P>
This time, the MQM is expected to sweep the Urdu-speaking areas
of the urban Sindh, and will also play a crucial role in the
formation of the next governments in both Sindh and the Center.
</P>
<P>
For ordinary Pakistani people, what they are most concerned
with is whether the coming elections will hold any real meaning
for them, and will they be different in any way from all the polls
already taken place since the lifting of martial law in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe the coming elections are unlikely to
resolve the deeper constitutional crisis that has long plagued the
country's politics.
</P>
<P>
And many believe that no matter which party comes to power,
poverty, along with corruption, will remain at a similar level in
the country.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Use 4.8 billion US Dollars of Foreign Funds in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's plunge in foreign
backed real estate has led to a major shift in investment
priorities in the country's biggest city.
</P>
<P>
The municipality has pledged to work hard to make an actual
use of 4.8 billion U.S. dollars in foreign funded investments
during 1997.
</P>
<P>
The city also hopes to achieve the goal of having an agreed use
of eight billion U.S. dollars of foreign funds and helping
foreign-funded enterprises in the city to earn five billion
U.S. dollars from exports in 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the city has designated industry,
construction of municipal projects, agriculture and tourism as its
key areas for introducing overseas investment this year.
</P>
<P>
The decision has been made to counter a plunge in foreign funds
in the real estate sector in the past year. And it is predicted
that the slump will continue this year. The aim is to improve the
investment environment and expand fields for foreign investment to
develop the city's economy in an active, rational and effective
way.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that the promised use of foreign funds was
some 11 billion U.S. dollars last year, and the actual ratio of
paid-in foreign direct funds against the total promised sum was
38.5 percent, ranking in second place in the country.
</P>
<P>
Production-oriented foreign-backed enterprises generated 172
billion yuan in industrial value last year, up 35 percent over
1995, and accounting for one third of the city's total industrial
value for 1996.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, foreign-backed enterprises achieved 205
billion yuan of sales and earned approximately 4.2 billion
U.S. dollars from exports last year.
</P>
<P>
Industrial guidance and planning will be enhanced in Shanghai
so as to make the work of investment promotion more effective,
improve services and the investment environment, and to turn
foreign-backed enterprises into the municipality's new growth
outlet for a sustained development of the national economy.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Accuse Israel of Delaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian leadership
has accused Israel of dragging its feet on setting up joint
committees to negotiate matters left over from old agreements,
JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in East Jerusalem,
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The complaints were raised in a statement issued in Gaza
Saturday night at the end of the weekly cabinet session which
was also attended by the PLO Executive Committee members.
</P>
<P>
The meeting focused discussions on the latest political
developments pertaining the peace process, including Israeli
settlement activities in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The
issues of Palestinians imprisoned and detained in Israeli jails,
"safe passage" between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, and the
Gaza airport and sea port were also discussed.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that a joint committee on releasing
Palestinian prisoners had yet to meet. It added that Israel was
delaying work on a Gaza sea port and implementation of a "safe
passage" between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, preventing
operation of Gaza airport and holding up donations from abroad
to its ports.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority warned that the
continuation of these measures could mean the end of the current
chance to continue the peace process and push the region and its
people again into the past of clashes and confrontations.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat is expected to raise the
issues when he meets with Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu during the annual World Economic Forum meeting
currently being held in Davos, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Hanan Ashrawi, Palestinian Minister of Higher Education, said
in Gaza Saturday that "We have of course written statements which the
president will take with him to Davos...and we will submit it to
the sponsors and of course to the international community."
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Davos
Saturday night, Arafat said he also briefed Mubarak on the
Palestinian grievances. "I kept him informed of the hot
situation in my country," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who is also attending the Davos conference, is also
scheduled to meet with Netanyahu. But a tripartite Middle East
summit is not likely, Arafat was quoted as saying.

SEOUL, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Overseas direct investments by
South Korean firms on an approval basis last year amounted to 6.08
billion U.S. dollars, up 23.7 percent over 1995, the Finance and
Economy Ministry said here today.
</P>
<P>
However, the pace of the country's overseas direct investments
slowed down in 1996. The years earlier saw direct investments
abroad rising more sharply: 55.6 percent in 1993, 90.9 percent in
1994 and 37.2 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 2.99 billion dollars were invested in Asia, 1.31
billion dollars in Europe, 1.18 billion dollars in North America
and 407 million dollars in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
As of the end of 1996, South Korea's approved cumulative
overseas direct investments had reached 19.24 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Flood Victims Relieved In North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Flood victims in north
China's Hebei Province will not have to worry about their living
conditions this winter, thanks to an ample supply of food and
clothing, as well as housing provided by the local and municipal
governments.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the provincial government show that the
majority of those affected by the disasters have received food
grain, heavy clothing and a place to live.
</P>
<P>
Zanhuang County, the hardest hit by the flood in August last
year, has received more than 6,650 tons of food grain from the
provincial and city governments and Taiwan charity groups, greatly
relieving its shortage of 5,805 tons of grain reported after the
flood.
</P>
<P>
Over 4.65 million items cotton-padded clothes and quilts have
been allocated to 1.98 million needy people, according to
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Figures also show that 92,000 families have moved into
permanent housing, and another 40,000 live in temporary homes.
</P>
<P>
"All the victims that lost their houses in the flood have a
shelter to live in now," said a government official, adding that
some are sharing living quarters with their relatives or neighbors.

<HEADLINE> 6 Drug Smugglers Killed in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Six drug smugglers were killed
in a recent operation launched by armed policemen in Iran's
southeastern province of Kerman, Persian daily Salam reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that those killed among the big narcotics gang
include their chief, nicknamed Sultan Shahbakhsh, in the operation
which lasted for 74 hours.
</P>
<P>
Akbar Pouryani, Commander of Kerman Law-Enforcement Forces,
said Saturday that the Iranian forces captured 500 kilograms of
narcotics, 12 motorcycles and two automobiles along with large
quantities of arms and ammunitions in the operation.
</P>
<P>
However, the report gave no date about the recent
operation. It said that the local government forces had launched
22 anti-drug operations and killed 17 drug traffickers in the
past year.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier report, Iran's Law Enforcement Forces
seized 155 tons of various kinds of narcotics at border points
in the past 10 months.
</P>
<P>
Drug is regarded as one of the main social problems of
the country since it is one of the best transit for drug to
Europe and is close to the "Golden Crescent" in the border area
between Afghanistan and Pakistan, one of the biggest
drug-producing centers in the world.
</P>
<P>
Iran passed a strict anti-drug law in 1989, which empowered
the Iranian authorities to execute the smugglers who were caught
with more than 30 grams of heroine or five kilograms of opium.
</P>
<P>
According to an early report, Iran executed over 4,000 drug
traffickers since 1988 and there are over 12,500 foreign
smugglers in the Iranian jails.

<HEADLINE> Repression of Electric Activity in Human </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli researchers, using
a unique brain monitor they developed, have proven for the
first time the presence of repression of electric activity in
the human brain, until now known only in animals.
</P>
<P>
Senior neuroscientist and physiologist Avraham Mayevsky says
the discovery, published in the winter issue of Brain
Research, will bring about better understanding of the
physiological processes involved in strokes, epileptic attacks,
migraine and other traumatic brain events and help develop
better drugs to treat them.
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon shown in human brains is called cortical
spreading depression (CSD), which has nothing to do with
psychological depression, but refers to the repression of
electro-encephalogram (electrical) activity that spreads in the
cortex of the brain from the site of stimulation to the
rest of the hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
The CSD, discovered in hares 50 years ago, proceeds for
several minutes, after which regular brain activity recovers by
itself, on condition that the stimulus is halted.
</P>
<P>
However, the higher one goes in the phylo-genetic ladder,
the harder it is to stimulate the phenomenon, and until
recently, there were scientific studies showing it was
"impossible" to create CSD in the human brain.
</P>
<P>
Mayevsky and his team discovered the phenomenon in a man who
was admitted to Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv, Israel, for severe
head trauma. He was one of 14 coma patients whose relatives agreed
to testing with the brain monitor Mayevsky has developed over the
past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The monitor senses inter-cranial pressure, local blood flow,
oxygenization, spontaneous electrical potential, temperature and
potassium concentration outside the cells.
</P>
<P>
These cannot all be determined simultaneously and in real time
by a computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance
instrument (MRI) scan but can be determined by using the brain
monitor.
</P>
<P>
A small hole was drilled in the frontal bone area of
the skull and the monitor's sensor was inserted and fastened
for hours at a time.
</P>
<P>
This patient showed spontaneous CSD for a period of
24 hours, at a frequency of one wave every half hour.
Gravely injured, the man died later.
</P>
<P>
The team hypothesizes that the CSD was initially stimulated
by one of the suction procedures used to clear his airways.
</P>
<P>
Mayevsky noted that since CSD has been linked in animals
to stroke, epilepsy, migraine and other traumatic events, the
discovery of its presence in man has great significance in
research and will help clinical treatment of patients as well.
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, Mayevsky and his colleagues have
used the monitor to diagnose many patients who suffered severe
brain trauma, during and after operation. The device is
in the final stages of being patented.
</P>
<P>
"One must remember that most of the information on which
drugs are developed, and especially those for treating brain
disorders, are based on animal studies," Mayevsky said.
</P>
<P>
"Only at the final stage are they tested on humans to
test for toxicity and efficacy," he said. "Our monitor's
complete physiological and biochemical mapping makes it possible
to check the influence of drugs on internal brain processes."
</P>
<P>
The discovery of CSD in man shows that the basic
biochemical processes in man's brain are very similar to those
in animals, said Mayevsky, who wrote the journal article along
with scientists from Bar-Ilan University and Ichilov Hospital's
neurosurgery department.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Float Tender for Clearing Land Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 2 (Xinhua) -- A tender will soon be floated
by the Zimbabwean Defence Ministry for companies to clear about
1.5 million landmines planted around the country during the
period before winning independence in 1980, the Sunday Mail
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Tshinga Dube, a general manager of Zimbabwean defence
industries and member of the UN advisory board on disarmament,
said here last week that the government is making efforts and
seeking for funds to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
Half a million hectares of land were not in use due to
landmines in the country in 1980 and onl y few of the mines have
been removed since then.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has recently donated about 12 million U.S.
Dollars for the clearance of part of the landmines in the
southern African country.
</P>
<P>
The mines were mainly planted along Zimbabwe's eastern border
with Mozambique and its northern border with Zambia, covering
an area of almost 800 square kilometers. enditem

TEHRAN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- France is eager to upgrade
bilateral ties with Tehran, a French government official was
quoted as saying today by English language daily Tehran Times.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Claude Cousseran, French Foreign Ministry's Director
General for Middle East and North Africa, made the statement here
Saturday while meeting with Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister
Mahmoud Vaezi.
</P>
<P>
Cousseran lauded Iran's decisive role in the Middle East and
described as "indispensable" the role it played to solve the
crisis in south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Guatemalan Mutinous Police Exchange Gunfire with Army Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The military police, who
are staging a mutiny in their barracks outside Guatemala City,
Guatemala, today exchanged gunfire with the army troops trying to
surround the barracks.
</P>
<P>
Gunshots were reported tonight at 21:15 (0315 GMT) when the
troops began taking up position in the quarters of the Treasury
guards adjacent to the barracks.
</P>
<P>
The army troops loyal to the government were moved in after
Guatemalan President Alvaro Arzu delivered a strong-worded
statement, saying that the government will not engage in talks
with the mutinous soldiers under military pressure.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the mutineers took hostage the army's
negotiating team led by General Vietor Manuel Ventura after the
two sides failed to reach agreement on the former's demand for
10,000 U.S. dollars to be paid to each of them upon demobilization.
</P>
<P>
But they released General Ventura and General Hector Mario
Barrios about half an hour later, holding only General Hugo
Aguilar Barrillas in the barracks.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 soldiers started the mutiny by occupying the
headquarters of the the Mobile Military Police January 29, exactly
one month after the Guatemalan government and the guerrillas
signed a historic peace accord, under which the army will be cut
by one thirds and the rebels will lay down their arms.
</P>
<P>
The 5,000-strong military police, which were set up to protect
private businesses in the civil war, will be demobilized according
to the accord.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers believe that the guerrillas were given a better
deal in the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
It was widely believed that the rebellion has seriously
threatened the fragile peace process in the Central American
country and made the situation more complicated.
</P>
<P>
The capital of the country, Guatemala City, was living in
tension after the start of the police mutiny. Hundreds of army
troops have been deployed around the National Palace which houses
the presidential office.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 2 (Xinhua) -- About four million Zimbabweans
suffer from bilharzia, three-forth of them under age 18,
according to the latest statistics from the Ministry of Health
and Child Welfare.
</P>
<P>
Director of Blair Research Laboratory Steven Chandiwana said
most of those infected have contracted the disease from water
bodies in their villages where there is a high rainfall.
</P>
<P>
However, Zimbabwe has reached an advanced stage in the
development of a vaccine against biharzia, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Blair Research is introducing community-based health
programs to build toilets and use the praziquantel drug to wipe
out the infection.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China, US Sign New Textiles Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- China and the United States
reached a new textiles trade agreement here at noon today
following six-day "tough but fruitful" talks.
</P>
<P>
The new agreement, the fifth of its kind, is a replacement of
the last one which, signed in 1994 and expired by the end of 1996,
was extended to the end of January this year with consensus of
both sides.
</P>
<P>
Li Dongsheng, head of the Chinese delegation, told Xinhua at
the end of the talks that "the new agreement eloquently
demonstrates that China and the US share interests in advancing
bilateral trade and economic cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, the agreement is "once again a proof that
China and the US can settle their trade disputes through
negotiations based on equality and mutual benefits for the sake of
creating a stable environment for the long-term development of
bilateral economic and trade ties."
</P>
<P>
Describing the talks as "very difficult", US chief negotiator
Rita Hayes said that for the first time ever in the textile talks,
China and the US have worked out all of their differences.
</P>
<P>
"We wouldn't have this agreement if it hadn't been for the
mutual understanding and trust that prevailed," she added.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Minister of Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi said
that during the talks, both delegations safeguarded their own
national interests and approached the agreement from the overall
perspective of bilateral trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Although the talks were "tough and fruitful," Wu added, they
were the first bilateral trade talks ever held over recent years
without resorting to any threat of sanctions or retaliations. She
expressed the hope that such a situation would be maintained in
future bilateral talks.
</P>
<P>
The practice has given an eloquent proof that it is futile to
resort to threat of sanction or retaliation in resolving trade
disputes, she added.
</P>
<P>
The talks were the fourth round of negotiations aimed at
reaching the present new trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
The new trade agreement will last four full years.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- "Food, clothing and shelter are
the most basic human rights," a top Myanmar official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a donation ceremony of a high-school building,
Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt said that there is no way or there
is no need to follow the type of Western democracy and human
rights, stressing that the democratic system should conform to the
customs and traditions of the race.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the Myanmar people should not try to copy the
so-called Western democracy.
</P>
<P>
The government has been devoting itself to fulfilling the basic
needs of food, clothing and shelter for its people and has been
striving for the establishment of a proper democratic system, he
said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Myanmar foreign minister U Ohn Gyaw also
criticized the U.S. State Department report on human rights in
Myanmar as "misleading," saying that the report does not duly
reflect the actual situation.
</P>
<P>
The world-wide human rights report, which was issued by the
U.S. State Department Thursday, has been criticized by many
countries around the world.

<HEADLINE> ANC Calls for New Investigations into Hani's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The African National
Congress (ANC), the ruling party in South Africa, has called on
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) to reinvestigate
into the 1993 murder of Chris Hani.
</P>
<P>
"The ANC has never closed its eyes to the possibility of a
wider conspiracy to murder Hani," the South African Press
Association quoted an ANC statement as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Hani was the South African Communist Party leader before he
was murdered allegedly by right-wing activists in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Polish immigrant Janus Walzu and rightist Clive Derby-Lewis,
who have been convicted of killing Hani, are expected to apply
for amnesty soon.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, ANC Member of Parliament Winnie Mandela claimed that
ANC members may have been involved in the assassination of Hani.
</P>
<P>
The ex-wife of President Nelson Mandela said it was hard to
believe that Hani's murder was the work of the right-wing alone.
</P>
<P>
In response, the ANC statement said any speculation will be of
no assistance if it is not placed before the TRC.
</P>
<P>
TRC, a fact-finding group authorized by the ANC-led
government, is responsible for investigation into violation of
human rights activities in apartheid era. enditem

<HEADLINE> Inland Regions to Profit from ADB loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Asian Development Bank (ADB) is
expected to loan 3.7 billion US dollars to China in the next three
years mainly for development projects in the country's central and
western regions, according to China Daily "Business Weekly" today.
</P>
<P>
ADB sent a delegation to China last month to consult with
Chinese government on the candidate projects for 1997 to 1999, a
People's Bank of China official said.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, about 30 Chinese projects -- mainly in energy
and transportation -- would receive loans.
</P>
<P>
ADB is shifting its Chinese operation from the east coastal
areas to inland provinces to achieve a more balanced economic
development in China.
</P>
<P>
The change matches the country's development strategy, which is
giving priority to developing inland provinces.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, China will direct more loans from ADB into its
central and western regions to reduce the economic gap between
inland provinces and coastal areas," the bank official said.
</P>
<P>
Of potential projects, half are in inland provinces, the
official said, adding that ultimately, inland projects will
increase.
</P>
<P>
"The coastal areas may get ADB loans for urban development
projects involving water supply and transportation," he said.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the best use of ADB funds, the country will focus on
improving projects' quality.
</P>
<P>
"Since the economic base in inland areas is weaker than in
coastal provinces, we will be more strict and cautious in
selecting inland projects," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Since China joined ADB in 1986, the bank has approved 6.38
billion US dollars of loans for 68 projects and granted more than
100 million US dollars worth of technical assistance for 234
projects.
</P>
<P>
China has been the largest borrower of the Manila-based
regional development institution for the past three years.
</P>
<P>
This year ADB is expected to finance seven projects; four of
which will be in inland provinces.

<HEADLINE> Hebei Province's Electronics Plan Needs Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Hebei Province, north China, is
set to carry out an ambitious electronics programme this year by
recruiting more foreign investors, according to today's "Business
Weekly".
</P>
<P>
Officials of the provincial government said foreign investors
were expected to commit 50 million to 60 million US dollars this
year for several projects.
</P>
<P>
With more foreign capital and cutting-edge technology, the
local electronics industry plans to launch manufacturing projects,
including color TV bulbs, large-screen televisions, liquid crystal
display, computerized digital telephone exchanges, semi-conductors
and mobile telecommunications equipment.
</P>
<P>
Value-added output of Hebei's electronics industry is expected
to increase 25 percent to reach 1.8 billion yuan (216.8 million
dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
This year, the province plans to produce 4.5 million color TV
bulbs, 350,000 large-screen televisions, 400,000 lines of
computerized digital telephone exchanges, 1.2 million
semi-conductor chips, 20,000 sets of mobile telecommunications
equipment, 50,000 cellular phones and 200,000 telephones.
</P>
<P>
With an eye on domestic and foreign markets, the province is
developing an export-oriented electronics industry. The industry
is expected to earn 85 million dollars in foreign exchange from
exports this year, up 40 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
The priority of local electronics industry is to keep abreast
of market trends. The industry's 300 enterprises are expected to
earn 500 to 600 million yuan (60-72 million dollars) in pre-tax
profits this year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, their pre-tax profits were 420 million yuan (51
million dollars), up 10 percent from 1995.
</P>
<P>
With 55,081 workers, the industry is developing a backbone
industrial sector for the local economy. The province hopes to
attain that goal by the end of 2000, local officials said.

<HEADLINE> Graf Quits Toray Open Final with Knee Injuries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Steffi Graf's knee injuries kept
her from playing the final and left the title to Swiss teen
sensation Martina Hingis at the Toray Pan Pacific Open women's
tennis tournament Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very sorry that I couldn't play today," Graf told a
capacity crowd of 8,800 during the award ceremony at Tokyo's
Metropolitan Gymnasium. "I'm disappointed myself."
</P>
<P>
Organizers said Graf, top-ranked in the world and the
tournament's top seed, withdrew "due to a severely aggravated
patella tendon of the left knee, at the bottom front of the
kneecap."
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old Hingis, fresh from her triumph in the
Australian Open a week earlier, received the champion's trophy and
a first prize of 150,000 U.S. dollars out of the total purse of
926,250 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
It was Hingis' seventh career singles title and the third
straight this year alone in as many tries, including at the Sydney
International.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, ranked second in the world, was seeded second for the
Toray.
</P>
<P>
Graf, the 27-year-old veteran who has won 102 singles titles,
received the runnerup prize of 67,500 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In that semifinals match Saturday, Graf gained revenge by
downing No. 8 seed Brenda Schultz-McCarthy of the Netherlands 6-1,
7-5. It was Schultz-McCarthy who had ousted Graf in the fourth
round of the Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
In the doubles final Sunday, second seed Lindsay Davenport of
the United States and Natasha Zvereva of Belarus beat No. 1 seed
Hingis and American Gigi Fernandez 6-4, 6-3.

<HEADLINE> Bill on MPs' Defection to Be Tabled in Nepali House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 2 (Xinhua) -- A bill on defection of
Members of Parliament (MPs) is expected to be presented to the
forthcoming winter session of Nepal's House of Representatives,
the lower house of parliament, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1991 constitution of Nepal, a lawmaker's seat in
parliament will become vacant if the party, from which he was
elected, notifies the parliament that he has left the party.
</P>
<P>
However, such a constitutional provision has not yet put into
force due to the lack of a defection law, newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
Controversies and conflicts arose in the lower house during a
special session in December last year when ruling MPs demanded the
speaker to expel two colleague lawmakers, who had quit their party
and sat on the opposition bench for a no-confidence motion against
the three-party government.
</P>
<P>
The two MPs of the Nepal Sabdhavana Party (NSP), third partner
of the ruling coalition led by the Nepali Congress (NC) party,
defected their party to support the censure motion filed by the
main opposition -- the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist
Leninist, CPN-UML).
</P>
<P>
Due to the absence of a defection law, the case of the two
defected MPs was left undecided.
</P>
<P>
The Opposition motion later was narrowly defeated in a house
voting despite the support of some MPs from the ruling camp.
</P>
<P>
In the proposed defection bill, a MP's seat will be
automatically considered vacant after his party presents a notice
to the lower house speaker or upper house chairman, depending on
the case, about his defection, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming winter session of the Nepali parliament is
expected to be convened later this month.

<HEADLINE> China Lifts Ban on Some US Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
decided to call off its retaliatory measures concerning temporary
suspension of import of some products from the United States, a
spokesman with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (Moftec) announced here today.
</P>
<P>
A statement jointly issued by the Moftec and the General
Administration of Customs November 10, 1996, noted that China
would temporarily impose a ban upon the import of some US products
as a retaliatory measure against the quota reduction of China's
textiles imposed by the US.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the fourth round of textiles talks between the
Chinese and US delegations, the Moftec spokesman said, the Chinese
government decided on Saturday to lift the ban, since both sides
have found a proper solution to the issue during their
negotiations.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The State Development Bank
(SDB) of China and the Export Import Bank of Japan last week
signed a 280 million US dollar deal to help finance a nuclear
power project in east China.
</P>
<P>
The loan will help finance the third phase project of the
Qinshan nuclear power plant in Zhejiang Province, according to
today's China Daily. The project is partially financed through
1.84 billion US dollars in loans from the SDB, Export Development
Co. of Canada and Export and Import Bank of America.
</P>
<P>
The power plant plans to install two 700-megawatt heavy-water
reactors, the first of their kind in China. Others are light-water
reactors.
</P>
<P>
The first generator is expected to produce electricity by the
year 2003 and the second by 2004.
</P>
<P>
The third phase is expected to require 2.68 billion US dollars
in foreign exchange, which will be raised by the SDB, a
policy-oriented bank responsible for pooling funds for the state's
major infrastructure projects and basic and pillar industries.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be repaid in 15 years with a seven-year grace
period. The interest rate is 7.49 percent, lower than the
commercial loan rate.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Introduces High Yield Variety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has introduced a new
high yield variety of seed paddy named "Lanka Samurdhi" which
could yield 5 to 6 tons per hectare, according to a Sinhalese
newspaper here.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that this was initially introduced in the
South of the country by the Sri Lankan Paddy Research Institute as
 part of the effort to accelerate the ongoing agricultural
revolution in the Island.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that most of the arable low lands in the
country are neglected for want of suitable varieties of seed paddy
to grow specially in the country's wet zone.
</P>
<P>
Consequently wet zone farmers have neglected thousands of
hectares of paddy land as they could not meet their cost of
production due to poor yields.
</P>
<P>
The new variety of paddy introduced can be cultivated in any
part of the country and it will yield well under different
climatic condition, the reports said, adding that the varieties
can resist disease better than others.

<HEADLINE> Gold Policy Welcomes Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- China is determined to continue
drawing foreign investors to the gold industry, although foreign
companies haven's produced a speck of gold dust since China opened
the industry in 1993, said today's China Daily "Business Weekly".
</P>
<P>
"You can not expect everything to change in a short period of
time," said Ai Dacheng, deputy bureau director of the Ministry of
Metallurgical Industry (MMI). "During the long opening process,
China needs understanding from the overseas partners since the
management of the industry is still a planned one. China needs to
work out a series of regulations both suit the domestic situation
and international practice."
</P>
<P>
China decided to open low-grade gold mines on a trial basis to
foreign partners in August 1993.
</P>
<P>
In China, mineral resource prospecting work is conducted by the
Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources (MGMR), while
exploration is undertaken by industrial departments.
</P>
<P>
This means the opening of the industry is the responsibility of
several departments, which complicateds the implementation of
certain projects.
</P>
<P>
However, it is gaining some progress in co-operation with
foreign companies through efforts, Ai said.
</P>
<P>
A group of projects on co-operative exploration and risk
prospecting have been submitted to department concerned for
approval after negotiation and assessment.
</P>
<P>
For example, at the Zhaoyuan Gold Group's Dayingezhuang Gold
Mine in east China's Shandong Province, negotiations are underway
for a 50-50 joint venture with the Asia Minerals Corp of Canada.
</P>
<P>
The project, with a proven reserve of more than 70 tons of
gold, is approaching to its final stage of approval.
</P>
<P>
The State Council in May last year agreed that foreign
companies be allowed to conduct risk prospecting of the Chinese
gold reserves in central and western China.
</P>
<P>
The prospecting companies are expected to be given priority in
exploring the mines, Ai said.

<HEADLINE> Tax Officials' Strike to Affect Dhaka's Revenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi government officials
worried that the tax revenue collection may suffer badly if the
work stoppage of the income tax officials continues.
</P>
<P>
The period from January to June, the last six months of a
financial year, is the high time for tax revenue collection, said
officials of the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The income tax officials went on a work stoppage following the
assault on two taxation officers by the owner of Rajmoni-Razia
Cinema and Rajmoni Ishakha Hotel on Thursday last. It was also
alleged that the accused person also gave death threat to the tax
officials.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the incident, the income tax officials
convened an emergency meeting of the Taxation Association and
demanded exemplary punishment to Ahsanullah Moni, the proprietor
of the cinema and the hotel.
</P>
<P>
Officers and employees of all levels of the income tax
department on Saturday brought out a procession in Dhaka demanding
immediate arrest of Ahsanullah Moni within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
The row between tax officials and Moni began when the bank
accounts of Moni were frozen by the income tax department to
realize outstanding income tax worth more than one million taka
(about 25 thousand US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Moni was given a series of notices before his accounts in 14
banks were frozen, tax officials said.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Banker Calls For Compromise to Tide Over Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The only way to tide over the
current complicated situation in Bulgaria is to seek compromise
among all political parities in the country, said Bulgarian
National Bank President Lyubomir Filipov today.
</P>
<P>
Filipov made the remarks to reporters after meeting with
President Petar Stoianov.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Filipov told the president that the
financial situation in the country is also very grim and Bulgaria
should reach new agreements with the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his bank had done all it could against the
grim situation and pointed out that any more interference will
produce even worse side effects.
</P>
<P>
It is vital that a government supported by the parliament must
be established to tide over the financial crisis, to put an end to
the negotiations with the IMF and to adopt a system of monetary
commission, he put.
</P>
<P>
The bank president said that he would resign if he could not
get the trust and support from the parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, he also said that if he left his post now, it would
worsen the financial situation.
</P>
<P>
The financial situation looks very bad with foreign currency
reserves down to 500 million U.S. dollars due to the escalation of
political crisis and social instability in the country.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement, Bulgaria will have to pay a debt of 130
million dollars to the London Club within this month. If the
country could not get fresh foreign loans, its foreign currency
reserves will continue dropping.
</P>
<P>
The market of foreign currency has been out of control and the
central bank could not intervene in it as the Bulgarian currency
lev depreciated about 150-200 percent every day. Now many shops in
the country mark prices of goods in U.S. dollar and German Mark.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the lev depreciation, the real income of the
Bulgarians fell 70 percent in 1996 and further down in January.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of protesters organized by the opposition gathered in
central Sofia Saturday on the 27th day of anti-government rallies
to pressure Bulgaria's ruling Socialist government to step down
and call for elections two years in advance.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party suffered a sweeping defeat in the presidential
elections last November and is widely blamed for an economic
collapse in which the inflation rate has hit 50 percent a month
and still keeps rising.
</P>
<P>
Elected in December 1994, the ruling party has had a caretaker
cabinet since Prime Minister Zhan Videnov resigned at the end of
last year.

<HEADLINE> Central Bank to Tighten Payment Supervision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China
(PBOC), the country's central bank, will tighten supervision of
commercial bank's payment and settlement systems and pressure them
to improve.
</P>
<P>
The PBOC, the central bank, is determined to reduce risks in
commercial transactions and preserve a sound financial order,
today's China Daily quoted a senior official of the bank as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official blamed flawed payment and settlement systems as
reasons for complicated debt chains between enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying that the central bank will attempt to
upgrade payment and settlement services by spreading the use of
commercial bills. It would also promote the "Three Nos" system: No
delivery of goods without payment; no delivery without commercial
bills; and no delivery if the buyer does not repay outstanding
bills.
</P>
<P>
The coal, electricity, chemical and railway industries adopted
the practice last year. It helped speed up capital flow and
prevent defaults, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 95 percent of coal industry loans were recalled, while
some defaulted debts were returned.
</P>
<P>
This year, the central bank intends to exercise commercial bill
settlement in large and medium-size enterprises, grain plants and
agricultural producers, which have fixed buyers and sellers.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the PBOC will develop diverse credit
payment methods, including the letters of credit and other bank
drafts.
</P>
<P>
The government is expected to issue a regulation on letters of
credit to guide the practice in large and medium-size firms.
</P>
<P>
Other bank drafts also will be promoted as more banks will be
allowed to distribute and cash bank drafts.
</P>
<P>
Use of checks and credit cards will be expanded. Large cities
such as Beijing and Shanghai could extend the check settlement to
neighbouring areas.
</P>
<P>
Credit cards will play an increasing role in simplifying
routine payments, and the central bank will improve the
accessibility of credit cards by unifying technical standards and
expanding the network of businesses that accept credit cards,
according to the official.

<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
"People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- A spokesman from the Taiwan Affairs Offices of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State
Council has responded to the so-called "national development
conference" held by the Taiwan authorities, accusing them of going
to far down the path of separatism.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the Taiwan authorities recently held the
conference, during which they defined the relations between the
two sides of the Taiwan Straits as "two equal political entities,"
and said nothing about "one China" and the reunification.
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese President Jiang Zemin has appointed six new
ambassadors following a decision of the National People's Congress
(NPC) Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
-- North China's Hebei Province and the capital of Beijing
worked hard to implment the re-employment project in the past two
years, during which Hebei provided employment opportunity for
223,000 people in the past two years, whereas the Chinese capital
created 111,000 jobs for laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
"Xinhua Daily Telegraph"
</P>
<P>
-- The US side must stop its erroneous actions of interfering
in China's internal affairs with an excuse of human rights issue,
Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tang made the remarks when asked to comment on US Department of
State's annual "Human Rights Report" in 1996, which criticized
China's human rights situation.
</P>
<P>
-- Three documents concerned with Hong Kong's transition were
approved at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Preparatory
Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR),
which closed Saturday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The three documents included the decision mandating that the
first Chief Executive and the Provisional Legislative Council of
the Hong Kong SAR will start their work before June 30, 1997; the
decision on the establishment of the provisional regional
organizations in the Hong Kong SAR; and a suggestion on how to
handle the original laws of Hong Kong, according to a press
communique issued at the end of meeting.
</P>
<P>
China Daily "Business Weekly"
</P>
<P>
-- Imported capital goods for foreign-funded projects launched
in China between October 1995 and April 1996 will remain
tariff-free until July 1998 at the latest, thanks to a six-month
extension of the privilege.
</P>
<P>
China planned to eliminate the exemption by the end of 1996 for
projects worth fewer than 30 million US dollars. Those worth at
least 30 million dollars were eligible for the exemption until the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
-- China is determined to continue to attract foreign investors
to the gold industry, although foreign companies haven't produced
a speck of gold dust since China opened the industry in 1993.
</P>
<P>
-- The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is expected to loan 3.7
billion US dollars to China in the next three years mainly for
development projects in the country's central and western regions.

<HEADLINE> Taka to Be Fully Convertible Next Fiscal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is expected to go for
full currency convertibility in capital account next fiscal year,
in a bid to attain full confidence of overseas investors in a
maximum liberal atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
"We are now gathering the necessary strength so that we may
consider capital account convertibility of taka from the next
financial year", Lutgar Rahman Sarkar disclosed on Saturday, who
is the governor of the Bangladesh Bank.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh opted for the transitional path to convertibility
with the introduction of current account convertibility of taka in
1994.
</P>
<P>
In the case of capital account convertibility of taka, buying
of other currencies for settlement of all current external
transactions including trade, travel, services payments, transfer
of profits etc. can be done freely.
</P>
<P>
"Stable reserve position, increase of production base etc. are
necessary for opting for full convertibility", the central bank
chief executive said.
</P>
<P>
A stable reserve of two billion US dollars will be necessary
for opting for capital account convertibility, said Rahman Sarkar,
adding that the government has a target to develop 2.3 billion US
dollars reserve at the end of the current fiscal ranging from last
July to June 30 next.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the central bank governor ruled out any immediate
plan of devaluation as it may adversely affect the current low
level of inflation, now 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The overall economy is also doing well with exports marking
rise and imports, mainly of consumer goods, registering fall.
However, "we may consider adjustment in future for further growth
in export," he added.

<HEADLINE> Philippines for Creation of ASEAN-Wide Stock Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) should build an ASEAN-wide stock exchange in
response to the creation of capital markets groupings around the
world, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo as
saying that the ASEAN member economies should bind themselves
closer and enhance their regional interests through the
installation of an ASEAN-wide Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
He said since the creation of capital markets groupings around
the world became increasingly irreversible as a result of
globalization, it is imperative for Asian countries to make the
move.
</P>
<P>
De Ocampo said the establishment of an ASEAN-wide bourse would
complement these efforts since it will facilitate a smoother flow
of capital movement in the region.
</P>
<P>
He added that the mechanics for a smooth functioning ASEAN
stock exchange must be carefully drawn, beginning with common
regulatory standards, operational practices, common hardware and
software and electronic infrastructure to support an integrated
bourse.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam.

<P>
ROME. February 1 (Xinhua) -- A Rome court rejected today an
application for the 83-year-old former SS (Schutzstaffel) Captain
Erich Priebke to be transferred from prison to house arrest
pending his retrial on war crimes charges.
</P>
<P>
The charges against Priebke, concern his admitted part in a
reprisal killing of 335 men and boys at the Ardeatine Caves
outside Rome in 1944.
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Priebke was found guilty of the charges but
released under a statute of limitations.
</P>
<P>
The ruling sparked massive protests and Italy's highest appeal
court, the court of Cassation, later overturned the judgement and
ordered a retrial.
</P>
<P>
However, both civil and military courts in Rome subsequently
declared that the case is outside their competence and Priebke is
waiting for the Court of Cassation to rule on where he should be
retried.
</P>
<P>
Priebke was extradited from Argentina in 1994 and brought to
Italy for the trial.
</P>
<P>
His co-accused, former SS Major Karl Hass, 84, who originally
came to be a witness at Priebke's first trial but was later
charged himself, is being held under house arrest at a clinic
outside Rome.

<HEADLINE> Exemption Extended Six Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Imported capital goods for
foreign-funded projects launched in China between October 1995 and
April 1996 will remain tariff-free until July 1998 at the latest,
thanks to a six-month extension of the privilege.
</P>
<P>
China planned to eliminate the exemption by the end of 1996 for
projects worth fewer than 30 million US dollars. Those worth at
least 30 million dollars were eligible for the exemption until the
end of this year, said today's China Daily "Business Weekly".
</P>
<P>
But the country extended both deadlines for half a year under a
recently adopted customs decree.
</P>
<P>
The extension will quash foreign investors' fears they might
not be able to receive necessary capital goods before the
exemption expires, said Xu Yaping, a deputy director-general from
the State Council's Special Economic Zone Office.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, investors of projects forged before last April do
not have to worry about the expiration," he said. "Individual
companies with difficulty meeting the deadlines can appeal to the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec) for
more time."
</P>
<P>
In a related matter, China decided to retain border trade
tariff deductions through 1998. They were to be eradicated last
year.
</P>
<P>
For years, China has been tuning its investment and trade
policies to usher overseas funding to select sectors and areas, Xu
said.
</P>
<P>
China is justified in eliminating imported capital goods tax
exemptions because it helps to create a taxation regime based on
fair competition, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese government must differentiate among
sectors because the cuts would result in 30-40 percent increases
in investment costs for high technology projects. About 75 percent
of a technology project's value comes from equipment investments,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Xu said he doubted appropriate departments may
have underestimated the negative effects of eliminating the
privilege.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Justice Minister Visits U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Colombian Justice
Minister Carlos Medellin arrived in the United States today to
brief Washington about the progress of Colombia's fight against
drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit, Medellin is scheduled to meet with
U.S. government officials and legislators.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian minister will request Washington's collaboration
in the exchange of evidences on drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian government has begun to confiscate the
properties of Pablo Escobar Gaviria, Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha,
Jose Santacruz Londono, and Carlos Lehder Rivas, the most
notorious drug trafficking lords in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian minister expressed the willingness of the Samper
government to sign with the United States a bilateral anti-drug
maritime agreement.
</P>
<P>
Medellin's visit, accompanied by Myles Frechette,
U.S. ambassador to Colombia, comes one month before Washington's
scheduled discussions about Colombia's performance in the fight
against drugs.
</P>
<P>
The minister is the first Colombian government official to
travel accompanied by a U.S. ambassador.
</P>
<P>
In March, 1993, the U.S. government failed to pass a so-called
law, evaluating the Colombian government's struggle against drug
trafficking, because it considered insufficient of President
Ernesto Samper's drug fighting efforts.
</P>
<P>
Medellin said that he will also explain to the U.S. government
and Congress why the Miguel and Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela
brothers, found guilty of drug trafficking, were given lenient
sentences of less than six years in prison, saying that this has
something to do with the legislative history of the country.

<HEADLINE> Panama, Colombia Vow to Protect Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Colombia and Panama signed
today a joint statement on the protection of the El Darien
National Park ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
The statement was signed by Panamanian President Ernesto Perez
Balladares and the visiting Colombian President Ernesto Samper.
</P>
<P>
Both presidents reaffirmed in the document their willingness to
comply with the international juridical mandate in environmental
matters, especially the United Nations convention on biological
diversity, signed in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The presidents in the joint statement committed themselves to
"increase, within our constitutional and legal responsibilities,
cooperation, friendship and exchanges in the border area, within
a constitutional context for a sustainable development."
</P>
<P>
"We encourage the exchange of technical, cultural, scientific,
and demographic information on the communities and the
biodiversity in the border region between the institutions of both
governments," added the joint statement.
</P>
<P>
The presidents directed in their statement the Colombian
Environment Ministry and the Panamanian Renewable Natural
Resources National Institute to determine as soon as possible the
basis for an instrument that will consolidate the will of the two
governments to work in an effective manner toward this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Perez Balladares said in his speech that the sovereign right of
each country to exploit its natural resources does not go against
the superior obligation to preserve biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
The El Darien National Park, with an area of almost 5,800
square kilometers, was declared by the United Nations Education,
Science, and Culture Organization (UNESCO) a reserve of the
biosphere and man, and is one of the tropical rainforests most
important in America and the world.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian president and his entourage ended their two-day
visit to Panama with the signing of the joint statement.

BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- China plans to apply for a
fourth group of loans from the Republic of Korea (ROK) this year.
</P>

transportation, environmental protection, farming and urban
water-supply for the third loan.
</P>
<P>
China has been applying for ROK loans since 1993.
</P>
<P>
China has set up bilateral lending relations with 20 developed
countries, including Japan, France and Germany. To date, 17.2

<HEADLINE> Albania Raises Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Albania's central bank has
decided to raise interest rates to an all-time high as of today to
attract more savings amid efforts to stem inflation and
devaluation of the Albanian currency lek.
</P>
<P>
According to the decision, the country's commercial banks,
savings banks and agricultural banks will raise the three-month
savings rate to 20.5 percent from 18.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Rates for six-month and one-year savings will be 21 percent and
22 percent respectively, up from the original 18.5 percent and 19
percent.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate adjustment came in the aftermath of tumbling
financial markets rocked by failed pyramid investment schemes that
cost many of their life savings.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of the Albanian lek against the U.S. dollar,
which stood at 99.3:1 last July, dropped to a record low of 134:1
Friday. It recovered a little today to 127:1.
</P>
<P>
Disgruntled investors in the failed pyramid investment schemes
staged demonstrations that led to street violences late last
month. Fresh protests are being planned to demand the dismissal of
the government and a fair deal for the investors.
</P>
<P>
State television today broadcast appeals from intellectuals,
clergymen and ordinary Albanians to prevent a repeat of last
week's violence.

<HEADLINE> Cameroun's Legislative Elections Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Camerounian Vice Prime
Minister Andze Tsoungui Gilbert has announced that the
legislative elections scheduled for March will be postponed for
weeks, reported a local radio here today.
</P>
<P>
Gibert made the remarks on Friday when meeting with various
political party representatives in the capital, explaining that
the major reason for the postponement of the elections was the
low turnout of citizens for registration.
</P>
<P>
The postponement was aimed to give more time to militants of
the various political parties wishing to run for the legislative
elections to register massively, he said.
</P>
<P>
Only about 50 percent of the population has registered so
far, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He called on the officials to register all potential voters
without any discrimination. Voters can register using old or new
identity cards and even those which have expired, he added.
</P>
<P>
Legislative elections should be conducted every five years in
Cameroun. The last elections took place in 1992. End

<HEADLINE> US President Promotes Family Medical Leave Law  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today urged Congress to expand the family medical leave law to
allow workers to take up to 24 hours of unpaid leave a year to
deal with family obligations, such as taking children to medical
appointments.
</P>
<P>
In a weekly radio address, Clinton said that an expansion of
family leave could enable millions more Americans to meet their
responsibilities both at home and at work.
</P>
<P>
"Our society can never be stronger than the children we raise
or the families in which we raise them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton signed the Family and Medical Leave Act into law in
1993. The law offers workers at business with 50 or more employees
to get 12 weeks of unpaid leave within a 12-month period with job
protection to care for newborn or adopted child, or a sick family
member.
</P>
<P>
But the Family Leave Commission in a research found that fewer
than one third of workers have learned on the job about the
benefits of the law.
</P>
<P>
According to the research released today, the commission found
that in four years, the Labor Department has received 6,346
complaints, mostly resulting from an employer refusing to
reinstate an employee to the same or equivalent job after taking
time off.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said today that the Labor Department is launching a
multimedia campaign to help get information out to millions
employees covered by the law.
