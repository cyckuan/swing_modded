Elian To Meet With Grandmothers
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's relatives in Miami received
orders today from the government to allow the young boy to meet with his
grandmothers in a neutral site. Justice spokeswoman Carole Florman said the
government had reassured the relatives that Wednesday's session at the Miami
Beach home of the president of a Dominican college would be just a visit and
would not result in his being taken back to Cuba. The grandmothers will see
Elian privately, but the boy's Florida relatives will be nearby in the house at
the time, Florman said.

Snow Paralyzes Parts of East Coast
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A fast moving storm dumped up to two feet of snow all along
the east coast, closing airports and schools. At least four people were killed
in weather-related traffic accidents in the Carolinas, and a 5-year-old girl was
missing and feared dead in Massachusetts after falling into an icy river while
walking to school in heavy snow. The storm closed major eastern airports,
including New York's LaGuardia and Washington's Reagan National Airport, and
others had delays and cancellations. It was the third snowfall in a week for
some states, but for much of the region it was the first major storm in a season
that has seen little snow.

	   NASHUA, N.H. (AP) -- George W. Bush said Tuesday he looked forward to a
"spirited contest" for New Hampshire votes as his chief GOP rival John McCain
declared himself more prepared to lead and Steve Forbes said he was the
"authentic conservative" in the race. Bush, who won Iowa's contest -- the first
voting of the campaign season -- with 41 percent of the vote called the outcome
a "good beginning" for his front-running campaign. Bush rejected the notion that
Forbes is a threat and said he would focus on beating McCain, who is leading
Bush in New Hampshire polls after skipping Iowa to concentrate on the Granite
State.

	   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- State investigators have searched the home of a
Mississippi Ku Klux Klan leader as part of their investigation of a threat
against state Attorney General Mike Moore. Jimmie Maxey, 62, identified by
Moore's office as the Imperial Wizard of the South Mississippi Ku Klux Klan,
said Tuesday that the four investigators searched his home in Petal and
confiscated a computer, Klan-related newspaper clippings, phone lists and
videotapes. Lee Martin, a special assistant attorney general, said the search
was in response to threatening statements on the Web site of the Alabama White
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.

	   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- A raging snowstorm couldn't keep more than 1,000
people from streaming into the Statehouse today to weigh in on the debate over
gay marriage. Fewer than half that number were able to get into the House
chamber where two committees gave people their first opportunity to comment on
last month's state Supreme Court ruling that said gay couples must be given the
benefits of marriage. The debate was civil, but emotional.

Russian forces to take a strategic square in the rebel capital Grozny on
Tuesday, attacking from the front and the rear to stymie the Russians' drive.

province's steep southern mountains, where an estimated 6,000 rebels are based,

Rangers Beat Penguins 4-3
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mike Knuble scored twice in the third period and the New
York Rangers won their seventh game in a row, rallying twice from two-goal
deficits to beat the Pittsburgh Penguins 4-3 Tuesday night. The Rangers were
1-17-3 when trailing after two periods until Knuble tied it with his eighth goal
at 8:48, then won it by grabbing a loose puck along the goal line and lifting it
over goaltender Tom Barrasso at 15:37. The winning streak is the Rangers'
longest since the 1993-94 season and was accomplished largely on the road, as
they completed a four-game road sweep by winning three times in four nights in
three cities.

<HEADLINE> Psychology of Bad Hair Days Studied  </HEADLINE>
   By DIANE SCARPONI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Bad hair days affect not just what's on your head,
but what's in it.
</P>
<P>
	   A Yale University study of the psychology of bad hair days found that
people's self-esteem goes awry when their hair is out of place.
</P>
<P>
	   They feel less smart, less capable, more embarrassed and less sociable.
</P>
<P>
	   And contrary to popular belief, men's self-esteem may take a greater licking
than women's when their hair just won't behave. Men were more likely to feel
less smart and less capable when their hair stuck out, was badly cut or
otherwise mussed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The cultural truism is men are not affected by their appearance,'' said
Marianne LaFrance, the Yale professor who conducted the study. ``This is not
just the domain of women.''
</P>
<P>
	   The study was paid for by Procter &AMP; Gamble, which makes shampoo and plans a
new hair-care line called Physique to provide more control over hair.
</P>
<P>
	   Janet Hyde, a psychology professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison
who studies body image and self-esteem, said personal appearance can have an
enormous effect on people, especially adolescents. But Hyde said she was
surprised to hear bad hair had a stronger effect on men than on women in some
cases.
</P>
<P>
	   For the study, researchers questioned 60 men and 60 women ages 17 to 30,
most of them Yale students. About half were white, 9 percent were black, 21
percent were Asian and 3 percent were Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
	   The people were divided into three groups. One group was questioned about
times in their lives when they had bad hair. The second group was told to think
about bad product packaging, like leaky containers, to get them in a negative
mindset. The third group was not asked to think about anything negative.
</P>
<P>
	   All three groups then underwent basic psychological tests of self-esteem and
self-judgment. The people who pondered their bad hair days showed lower
self-esteem than those who thought about something else.

<HEADLINE> Advertisers Drawn to Super Bowl  </HEADLINE>
    By SKIP WOLLENBERG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Super Bowl players from Madison Avenue have been
fine-tuning their best moves this week as Sunday's matchup between the Tennessee
Titans and the St. Louis Rams approaches.
</P>
<P>
	   Their work will be on display for an expected audience of more than 100
million people for a program that has become a showcase for commercials as well
as for football.
</P>
<P>
	   Eight percent of those watching Sunday's game will be tuning in just to see
the ads, researcher Eisner Communications found.
</P>
<P>
	   "Virtually the whole country comes to a standstill when the Super Bowl comes
on," said veteran commercial buyer Bill Croasdale of Western Initiative Media.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, about a dozen Internet companies are forking over the highest
prices ever paid for TV commercials so they can join regulars like
Anheuser-Busch, Pepsi-Cola and FedEx on the show.
</P>
<P>
	   There were only two dot-coms in last year's game -- three if you count
lingerie marketer Victoria's Secret which advertised its fashion show Webcast.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some companies are out there on hope and a prayer, but it's part of the new
economy," said Jeffrey Taylor, chief executive of online job site Monster.com,
one of the Internet advertisers in the 1999 game.
</P>
<P>
	   Monster and a rival employment site, Hotjobs.com, each said that visits to
their sites soared after last year's Super Bowl exposure, and both are back.
Their experience inspired several of this year's young Internet entrants.
</P>
<P>
	   Information provider Britannica.com; the job site Kforce.com, wedding
stationery supplier OurBeginning.com and technology adviser Computer.com are
among the first-time Super Bowl sponsors.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC officials say the Internet companies helped push the commercial price to
an average of $2.2 million -- an astounding $73,333 per second -- for 61
half-minute commercials in the game. The top price for an ad was said to be over
$3 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The average is a whopping 38 percent more than the previous record $1.6
million that the Fox network claimed for ads in last year's Super Bowl. The
price went up even though the average audience rating tumbled 9 percent last
year to the lowest level since 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   The attraction is that the Super Bowl delivers the year's highest TV ratings
and audiences over the past seven years in the 120 million to 130 million range.
</P>
<P>
	   Anheuser-Busch, brewer of Budweiser, is the single biggest Super Bowl
advertiser with five minutes of commercial time in the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Its ads include one designed to tug on your heart strings by showing the
birth of a new Clydesdale horse and another with former hockey star Wayne
Gretzky driving a tipsy friend home from a bar -- on a Zamboni machine.
</P>
<P>
	   Pepsi-Cola will pitch its hot-selling Mountain Dew. One ad shows a bike
rider chasing a cheetah across African plains, capturing and reaching inside the
cat to retrieve a stolen can of the soda.
</P>
<P>
	   FedEx inserts a delivery truck into clips from the classic "Wizard of Oz"
movie to show its couriers reach "places other shipping companies can only
imagine."
</P>
<P>
	   Pets.com's ad features its sock puppet singing "Don't Go" in a plea to
owners to spend more time with their pets by using the Web retailer for pet
supplies. Hotjobs shows its new computer hand icon driving a hard bargain in a
job interview while Tropicana pitches orange juice as "the best 9.3 seconds you
can possibly spend on yourself."
</P>
<P>
	   The World Wrestling Federation and Seven-Up each had ads rejected by the ABC
standards office, but came up with alternatives. The WWF, which won't specify
what ABC found objectionable, says its new ad shows "the unabashed excitement of
WWF fans in unexpected places." Seven-Up's original ad got thrown out because it
contained an off-color phrase. Its new one may not be much better. It exhorts
consumers to "show us your cans."
</P>
<P>
	   The dot-coms include the well-established like E-Trade with $700 million in
revenue last year. Others like OurBeginning.com and Computer.com are startups
that are using investors' money for their ads because they haven't yet generated
enough revenue to pay the bill.
</P>
<P>
	   August Busch IV, head of marketing for Anheuser-Busch, says anticipation of
these expensive bids for recognition could ultimately benefit established brands
like his Budweiser.
</P>
<P>
	   "It heightens consumers' interest in the 'other game' being played along
with the Big Game," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some media buyers say the two small-market teams in this year's game could
lead to lower ratings since neither has a national following.
</P>
<P>
	   But others say the Super Bowl will attract a big audience no matter who is
in it -- and that a close game is the key to retaining viewers.

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Will Sport Clever Ads  </HEADLINE>
    By FRAZIER MOORE AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Other than the usual complaints that the Super Bowl was
boring, EDS Corp. hopes the nation's watercooler chatter Monday will focus on
... cat herding.
</P>
<P>
	   If every office resounds with someone's imitation of the advertising line,
"Herdin' cats -- don't let anybody tell ya it's easy," then EDS will know it got
a good buy for the roughly $4.4 million it's paying to air its goofy commercial
on Sunday's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Exactly what the 60-second spot is trying to say about EDS may be a mystery
to most viewers. The company, which manages computer systems for industry and
government, is by no means a household name and its ad says little about its
business.
</P>
<P>
	   A parody of John Ford westerns with a nod toward Marlboro Country, the spot
depicts weathered cowpokes driving hundreds of cats across the plains.
</P>
<P>
	   It's hilarious. And for a company like EDS ("managing the complexities of
e-business," according to the commercial's tag), getting viewers' attention and
getting them to talk ain't hay.
</P>
<P>
	   Other Super Bowl sponsors will be after the same thing: a little attention.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike EDS, everybody knows what Budweiser is. Rather than make claims about
superior taste, one of the three commercials will continue a campaign to tie the
product to an attention-getting catchphrase, "Whasssssssup?"
</P>
<P>
	   And whasssssssup? According to the commercial, a perfect combo: "Watching
the game, having a Bud."
</P>
<P>
	   Another Bud spot plays good citizen. Grabbing a buddy's keys, retired hockey
star Wayne Gretzky volunteers to drive his chum home from the bar in what turns
out to be a Zamboni (one of those vehicles used to clean ice). Only when we see
it do we realize that his buddy is a rink tender.
</P>
<P>
	   "Surprising how well this thing handles," Gretzky says as they chug down the
street.
</P>
<P>
	   The third Bud spot shows a dapper fellow being called away from a black-tie
affair to his stable, where, never even changing from his evening duds, he helps
deliver a foal.
</P>
<P>
	   "Congratulations, fella," the gentleman vet says to the new "dad," a
Clydesdale proudly prancing about in the corral.
</P>
<P>
	   Those are the only words spoken during the spot and never is the product
shown. But the message equates Budweiser with sophistication, prosperity and
manliness, chased with a bracing "awwwwwwww!"
</P>
<P>
	   The sell is harder, yet the approach zanier, in a spot for the HotJobs.com
Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   Two mucky-mucks from some blue-chip firm are entertaining a job prospect at
their club. Over cigars and brandy, the boss intones, "Nobody can beat our
offer."
</P>
<P>
	   But the job prospect is a human-size HotJobs trademark -- a giant hand with
raised index finger. The hand retorts, "Stanley, please," then reels off rival
offers that make "your starting salary look like cab fare."
</P>
<P>
	   "You know what?" says Stanley. "I don't like you. But I'll give you what you
want."
</P>
<P>
	   Tag: "All the best jobs and the tools to find 'em," as a hand scorches
itself on the smoking HotJobs logo -- yeow!
</P>
<P>
	   Ads like that can sure score in a boring football game, even if a viewer
doesn't need a new job.

<HEADLINE> Economic Topics Covered by Comic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has added another
comic to its strip.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Story of Consumer Credit" is the latest in a running series of
educational handouts the bank publishes to explain economic topics to America's
high school and college students.
</P>
<P>
	   While there's no action super-hero, the latest book keeps true to its genre
by using light-hearted situations to better acquaint younger people with terms
such as collateral, finance charges and explain how interest rates are set.
</P>
<P>
	   The book also lists ways to establish good credit, among them, opening a
bank account or shopping for a low-interest credit card and paying the bill on
time.
</P>
<P>
	   One caption says banks "protect your money" while another shows an irate
thief who can't find any money under a boy's home mattress, "I'm going out of
business!" he screams.
</P>
<P>
	   The comics, which the Fed has been making since the 1950s, have become
increasingly popular with instructors who praise their clarity.
</P>
<P>
	   Past comics on money and banks are in their fourth and fifth printings --
meaning that about a million copies of each have been used in classrooms. This
is the eleventh book and an updated version of one of the best-liked comics
among readers because of its wide appeal. Credit cards are becoming more and
more popular, especially among the college-age crowd. While many manage their
new-found credit responsibly, the spending power can spell trouble for others.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly three-quarters of full-time undergraduate students already hold some
type of plastic, studies show.
</P>
<P>
	   The average undergraduate has $2,226 in credit card debt, 14 percent of
students carry balances between $3,000 and $7,000, while 10 percent have
balances exceeding $7,000, according to Nellie Mae, a nonprofit student loan
provider. Many of the biggest debtors, it says, hold four or more cards.
</P>
<P>
	   ----
</P>
<P>
	   EDITOR'S NOTE: Copies of "The Story of Consumer Credit" or other comics can
be obtained by calling the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at (212) 720-6134 or
writing to the bank at 33 Liberty St., New York, NY 10045.
</P>
<P>
	   Up to 35 copies of the comics are free. After that, they cost 25 cents each,
with exceptions for classroom use.

<HEADLINE> Lobster Glut Good for Customers  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHELLE EMERY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- Forget about waiting for lobster bakes on sandy
beaches. While summertime is lobster season in Maine, those craving the
crustacean can curl up this winter with a piping-hot bowl of lobster stew
without taking a big punch to the pocketbook.
</P>
<P>
	   A glut of lobster in Canada caused by an overestimation of millennium
celebration sales and a plentiful winter harvest there has flooded Maine with
lobsters from its northern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
	   The pipeline has created a buyer's market, with prices headed downward
instead of upward, as they normally do in the winter. Retail prices dropped by
$1 and more per pound last week.
</P>
<P>
	   "Now's the time to go get lobster," said Jeff Holden, president of the
industry group Maine Lobster Processors Inc. and of the Portland Shellfish
processing plant in South Portland.
</P>
<P>
	   Lobster normally runs about $7 a pound retail during the Christmas and New
Year's holidays. During this year's millennium holiday, lobster prices in
Portland ranged upwards of $9. But because of the glut, prices have since
dropped as low as $6, said Bob Brown, executive director of the Maine
Import-Export Lobster Dealers Association in Edgecombe.
</P>
<P>
	   Some in the industry would not be surprised to see retailers taking
advantage of the glut by running specials for as low as $4.99 a pound at
supermarkets, a price more often seen in summer.
</P>
<P>
	   How long lobster prices remain low, or if prices go even lower, remains to
be seen. But customers should enjoy it while it lasts.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's never happened since I've been fishing that prices have gone down in
January," said Frank Strout of Cape Elizabeth, who has been lobstering for 25
years.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides being good for customers at the checkout counter, the lower prices
are good for Maine processing plants that normally shut down lobster operations
in the winter, Holden said.
</P>
<P>
	   But anyone caught holding onto lobsters in anticipation of the normal winter
price increase could be hurt.
</P>
<P>
	   Fortunately for Maine dealers, they did not stock up or hold lobsters back
like their counterparts in Canada. Brown said Maine dealers never bought into
the idea that there would be a worldwide run on lobster for New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
	   It's too soon to say how long the deflated prices will be around, Brown
said. But it's not terribly unusual for lobster prices to dip after the
holidays, then rise again in February, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   For now, there is no end in sight to the glut because Canadian lobstermen,
who fish mostly during the winter, are continuing to haul in bountiful traps.
Maine lobstermen do most of their fishing in the summer but some continue
through the winter.
</P>
<P>
	   The few Maine lobstermen who continue fishing in winter have seen the boat
price of lobster drop to $3.50 a pound and then to $3.25 a pound in the last
week, said Pat White, executive director of the Maine Lobstermen's Association.
Normally, the boat price ranges from $2.50 a pound in summer to $4 or more in
winter, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The lower price does hurt those doing winter fisheries," White said. "Even
when there's a good day, some of the guys aren't going out, just waiting for
this to pass."
</P>
<P>
	   The lower prices are a regional anomaly. Other parts of the country likely
won't see any decreases in price because of the costs of shipping the lobsters.
</P>
<P>
	   White said the fluctuations are all part of the unpredictable nature of the
lobstering business.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we had a crystal ball, we would all be millionaires," White said. "This
is a very funny business."

<HEADLINE> No. 24 Temple 59, Xavier 40  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Mark Karcher scored 19 points as No. 24 Temple beat
Xavier 59-40 Tuesday night, holding the Musketeers to their fewest points in 18
years.
</P>
<P>
	   Xavier (11-7, 2-4 Atlantic 10), coming off a 31-point home loss to La Salle,
has dropped four straight games for the second time in coach Skip Prosser's
seven seasons. The Musketeers, who beat No. 1 Cincinnati last month, shot 24
percent in their lowest scoring game since a 30-28 loss on Jan. 23, 1982 to
Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
	   Pepe Sanchez, in his eighth game back from an ankle injury, had nine points,
eight assists, eight rebounds and three steals for Temple (13-4, 6-1), which won
its 17th straight home game.
</P>
<P>
	   Darnell Williams scored 15 points, and Lloyd Price had 14 for Xavier, which
hadn't lost four straight since its first year in the Atlantic 10 in 1995-96.
The Musketeers hit only 7 of 27 3-point shots.
</P>
<P>
	   Lamont Barnes and Quincy Wadley each scored 11 for the Owls.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanchez, the Owls' steady point guard, had two assists and four turnovers in
the first half but committed no turnovers in the second half. He shot 1-for-7
from the field. Temple, which shot 37 percent, has won three straight and seven
of eight.
</P>
<P>
	   The Owls went on a 22-4 run spanning the first and second halves, building
the lead to 36-22 on Wadley's 3-pointer with 16:36 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Lynn Greer's 3-pointer made it 46-30 with 9:11 left, but Xavier scored the
next eight points. Maurice McAfee hit a 3-pointer, Price a driving layup and
Kevin Frey a 3-pointer to cut it to 46-38 with 4:27 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Temple sealed it with a 9-0 run, getting a basket and 3-pointer from Wadley,
a driving jumper from Karcher and two free throws from Sanchez to make it 55-38
with 1:36 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 3,500 fans braved a snowstorm that battered the East Coast. Not counted
among them were Temple athletic department officials Scott Cathcart and Bob
Lange, who were pressed into duty at the scorer's table because only a skeleton
staff made it to the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Temple led 23-19 at halftime amid atrocious shooting by both teams. Xavier
was 7-for-33, and Temple 7-for-25. Only six players scored in the first half --
three for each team.
</P>
<P>
	   It was so bad that Xavier was 2-for-15 with nine turnovers in the first 8
1/2 minutes and yet only trailed 6-4. It appeared for a while that the teams
might challenge the A-10's record for fewest points in a game, 29 by Rutgers
against St. Bonaventure in 1982.

<HEADLINE> No. 17 Texas 82, Nebraska 55  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM VERTUNO AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Lawrence Williams and Chris Mihm each scored 14 points
and No. 17 Texas held Nebraska to five points over the last 11 minutes of the
first half in an 82-55 victory Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Williams was 4-of-5 from 3-point range for Texas (13-5, 5-1 Big 12
Conference). Steffon Bradford led Nebraska (9-10, 2-4) with 13 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Long on talent under the basket, Williams and the Longhorns found their
shooting touch from the perimeter early. Texas hit five of its first six 3-point
attempts.
</P>
<P>
	   The Longhorns also forced 14 Nebraska turnovers in the first half which
Texas converted into 20 points. Texas forced 28 Nebraska turnovers for the game
as Williams also had four steals.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas looked like it could be in for a long night when Nebraska center
Kimani Ffriend caught Mihm flat-footed with a lighting quick spin move and layup
for the game's first points.
</P>
<P>
	   Ffriend also blocked Mihm's first shot attempt before the Longhorns' 7-foot
center made a layup and scored seven of his team's first 11 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The game was tied 14-14 at 12:28 of the first half when Texas caught fire
from 3-point range. Chris McColpin, Lawrence Williams and Darren Kelly each hit
3-pointers in a 17-4 run that put Texas ahead 31-18.
</P>
<P>
	   After a timeout, Ivan Wagner hit an off-balance 3 from the top of the circle
and Gabe Muoneke jammed two dunks as Texas reeled off a 14-5 run to close the
half with a 45-23 lead. Muoneke also grabbed 14 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   The Longhorns kept up the pace in the second half as Wagner and Williams hit
three straight 3-pointers to stretch the lead to 60-32. Texas held its largest
lead at 71-36 with 8:33 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   The loss left Cornhuskers coach Danny Nee one victory shy of 253 wins at
Nebraska, the school record held by Joe Cipriano (1965-80).

<TEXT>
<P>
    MIAMI (AP) -- Cobi Jones will be in familiar surroundings when the United
States opens CONCACAF Gold Cup against Haiti on Feb. 12 in the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the veteran members of the U.S. squad, Jones makes frequent visits to
Miami, calling it a "second home."
</P>
<P>
	   But Jones and his teammates probably won't have home-field support when they
play Haiti in the opener of the biennial championship of soccer's North and
Central American and Caribbean region.
</P>
<P>
	   Haiti figures to have the majority of the followers in the 75,000-seat
stadium along with Colombia, which plays Jamaica in the other half of the
doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is nothing new to us," U.S. defender Carlos Llamosa said. "Last week,
we played Iran in the Rose Bowl and the majority of the fans favored Iran."
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. team could use the lack of crowd support as a motivational tool in
the 12-nation tournament, which also will feature first-round matches in San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
	   Defending champion Mexico in the favorite. Colombia, Honduras and Jamaica
are in Group A; Haiti, Peru and the United States in Group B; Guatemala, Mexico
and Trinidad and Tobago in Group C; and Canada, Costa Rica and World Cup co-host
South Korea in Group D.
</P>
<P>
	   The top two finishers in each group advance to the quarterfinals Feb. 19 and
20. The semifinals will be on Feb. 23 and 24 in San Diego and Los Angeles, and
the final will be in Los Angeles on Feb. 27.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to its opener, the U.S. team's other first-round match will be
against Peru on Feb. 16 in the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is an important tournament," Jones said. "It's sort of the Euro 2000
for North American teams."
</P>
<P>
	   For coaches such as Jamaica's Rene Simoes, who led the Caribbean nation to a
1998 World Cup berth, the challenge is to assemble top players from their clubs
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   "We, as coaches, experience a very complicated situation trying to bring
back players from overseas," Simoes said. "Some of these club coaches don't
understand that this is an important event."

   BEIJING (AP) -- A strong earthquake jolted the Himalayan Mountains in Tibet
near the border of Bhutan early Wednesday, but there were no immediate reports
of casualties, China's official Xinhua News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 5 struck Cona county, 15
miles east of Bhutan, around 12:45 a.m., Xinhua said, citing government
seismologists.
</P>
<P>
	   The region is sparsely populated and has poor communication links with
Lhasa, Tibet's capital 150 miles to the northwest, and the rest of China, Xinhua
said.
</P>
<P>
	   China is going through a period of increased earthquake activity. Two
earthquakes hit Yunnan, the province neighboring Tibet, on Jan. 15, leaving
90,000 people homeless. The state-run China Daily reported Wednesday that the
death toll from those quakes has risen to seven people.

Snow Paralyzes Parts of East Coast
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A fast-moving storm dumped up to two feet of snow all along
the east coast, closing airports and schools. At least four people were killed
in weather-related traffic accidents in the Carolinas, and a 5-year-old girl was
missing and feared dead in Massachusetts after falling into an icy river while
walking to school in heavy snow. The storm closed major eastern airports,
including New York's LaGuardia and Washington's Reagan National Airport, and
others had delays and cancellations. It was the third snowfall in a week for
some states, but for much of the region it was the first major storm in a season

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A strong demand for prescription drugs will push spending
online for health care products and services to $9.8 billion in 2004, up from
just $200 million in 1999, a new study says. Even so, most consumers still find
buying in traditional stores more convenient, according to the report being
released Wednesday by the Internet research firm Jupiter Communications. In a
Jupiter survey of 1,667 shoppers last fall, nearly half said it is easier to
shop in a traditional drug store, where they can get personal attention, low

<HEADLINE> Competitors Appeal Tabloid Ruling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A group of newspaper publishers have appealed a federal
judge's decision that allowed a new competitor to continue distributing
newspapers at area train, subway and bus stops.
</P>
<P>
	   The publishers of The Philadelphia Inquirer, the Philadelphia Daily News,
The New York Times and USA Today contend that Metro enjoys an unfair advantage
because of an unconstitutional agreement with the Southeastern Pennsylvania
Transportation Authority.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeal was filed Tuesday as the tabloid published its second edition.
</P>
<P>
	   The other newspapers argue that Metro's contract with SEPTA is
unconstitutional because it allows a government agency to assert control over a
newspaper and allows the free paper to be distributed where other publications
cannot be sold.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Robert F. Kelly denied the newspapers a temporary
restraining order Monday, saying they failed to show that they would suffer
"immediate and irreparable harm" if the order was not granted.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspapers appealed Kelly's decision to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals and filed a motion seeking an injunction barring the distribution of
Metro pending the appeal.

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted in Murder on Tape  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A man who fatally shot his ex-wife at a
cemetery while a TV camera rolled has been convicted of murder and sentenced to
life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Tuesday's sentence, Emilio Nunez, 40, must serve at least 25 years in
jail before he can be considered for parole. Nunez was given credit for the
seven years he has already served while awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
	   A reporter for the Spanish-language network Telemundo was interviewing Nunez
in 1993 at the grave of his 15-year-old daughter, who had killed herself.
Maritza Martin, Nunez's ex-wife, arrived unexpectedly, and he accused her of
causing their daughter's suicide by slapping the girl because she was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
	   Nunez then pulled a gun, shot Ms. Martin in the head and fired 11 more times
as she lay on the ground.
</P>
<P>
	   The reporter, Ingrid Cruz, and her cameraman ran for cover, but not before
filming much of the shooting. The tape was shown in court.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorney Reemberto Diaz told the jury that Nunez was angered by the
reporter's questions. The attorney said Cruz had asked questions designed to get
an emotional response.
</P>
<P>
	   Telemundo spokesman Ted Guefen countered last week: ``It is irresponsible to
suggest that Telemundo or Ingrid Cruz are in any way responsible for this
terrible tragedy.''

<HEADLINE> Circus at City Hall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Pssst ... Hear the one about the circus that broke out
at City Hall?
<P>
	   Two protesters from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals tossed phony
money into the air at City Hall on Tuesday, just inches from Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, who was accepting the title Ringmaster for Life from a real ringmaster
and clowns from Ringling Bros. and Barnum &AMP; Bailey Circus.
</P>
<P>
	   "The elephants can't buy their freedom, but Ringling bought you," the PETA
protesters hollered at the mayor.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters claim that the historic circus is cruel to its animals and
that Giuliani has been bought by Ringling Bros. because his exploratory U.S.
Senate campaign accepted $2,000 from Kenneth Feld, a member of the family that
owns the circus.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani said after the disruption that he initially thought the protesters
were part of the collection of clowns and other costumed characters who gather
with him at City Hall each year to announce that the circus is coming to town.
</P>
<P>
	   His face tightened in fear when he realized the activists were not part of
the show. But when he realized they intended him no physical harm, he began
laughing.
</P>
<P>
	   The disruption, which occurred in the Blue Room, lasted about 25 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   "That was not part of the show," Giuliani said, smiling as the pair was
dragged from the room, still chanting. "But maybe it is in New York City, part
of the show."
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Giuliani joked that the protest was part of a left-wing conspiracy -
a reference to first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's insistence last year that the
impeachment proceedings against President Clinton were part of a vast right-wing
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton is expected to be Giuliani's opponent for a seat in the U.S.
Senate this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said the two demonstrators impersonated New York University
journalism students to breach the tight security at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
	   For the past year and a half, Giuliani has beefed up security at the
building to prevent possible terrorist attacks. Pop-up barricades block
vehicles, and police officers stationed around the perimeter prevent people
without business there from entering.
</P>
<P>
	   To get to the Blue Room, the PETA demonstrators had to pass through at least
three police checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
	   "If they can breach security, anyone can breach security," Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters, identified by PETA as Luke Downing, 20, of Lincoln, Neb.,
and Arathi Jayaram, 23, of Norfolk, Va., were charged with trespassing and
disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, outside City Hall, two other PETA activists placed themselves in
tiny cages in the 20-degree cold and snow for about an hour to protest the
treatment of the circus animals.
</P>
<P>
	   "Giuliani's turning his back on the suffering of animals," said Melinda
Duval, 34, of Norfolk, Va., from inside one of the cages.
</P>
<P>
	   During the past two years, several of Ringling's animal performers have
died, including an elephant that succumbed to respiratory failure and a tiger
that mauled its trainer and was shot by the trainer's brother.
</P>
<P>
	   Ringling spokeswoman Barbara Flughaupt said Tuesday that the circus's
animals are treated extremely well.
</P>
<P>
	   She said, referring to the PETA members, "They don't believe in the training
of any animals at all. Incrementally, they are for the segregation of all
animals and people."

<HEADLINE> Hormone Combination May Pose Risk  </HEADLINE>
    By LINDSEY TANNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Menopausal women using the common hormone supplements
estrogen and progestin run a 20 percent higher risk of breast cancer than those
who use just estrogen, researchers reported today.
</P>
<P>
	   While the risk of breast cancer is still low for women who take both
hormones, the increased odds might further complicate the decision menopausal
women must make about their health.
</P>
<P>
	   Estrogen is often prescribed to ease hot flashes and other menopause
symptoms. It also has been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease and brittle
bones.
</P>
<P>
	   After research in the 1980s linked estrogen use to uterine cancer, doctors
began prescribing it along with progestin, a synthetic form of the hormone
progesterone. It helps block estrogen's effect on the uterine lining.
</P>
<P>
	   Some previous studies have linked estrogen supplements, either alone or
combined with progestin, with higher rates of breast cancer. Other research has
found no increased risk.
</P>
<P>
	   Hormone-therapy proponents say the risks noted in the current study --
published in today's Journal of the American Medical Association -- were too
small to be significant. Others contend the findings bolster the notion that
women weighing hormone use should proceed with caution.
</P>
<P>
	   "If a woman is experiencing severe menopausal symptoms that affect her
quality of life, fear of breast cancer shouldn't discourage short-term use,"
said Catherine Schairer, a National Cancer Institute epidemiologist and the
study's lead author. With long-term use, she said, there is "considerably more
concern."
</P>
<P>
	   The study gathered data on hormone use from questionnaires given to 46,355
women participating in a nationwide breast cancer screening project from 1980
through 1995. The survey identified 2,082 breast cancer cases.
</P>
<P>
	   Compared with women who reported never using hormones, women who used
estrogen within the previous four years faced a 20 percent higher risk of breast
cancer. For current or previous users of estrogen-progestin, the risk was 40
percent higher than for non-users.
</P>
<P>
	   For each year of use, the risk of developing breast cancer increased 1
percent for estrogen-only users and 8 percent for estrogen-progestin users.
</P>
<P>
	   Women who had been off either treatment for more than four years faced no
increased risk, regardless of how long they had taken hormones.
</P>
<P>
	   Three Harvard University doctors, Walter Willett, Graham Colditz and Meir
Stampfer, wrote an accompanying editorial urging further study of the long-term
use of both hormones.
</P>
<P>
	   They said that the uncertainties raised by the new study and others suggest
that long-term treatments other than estrogen and progestin be considered.
</P>
<P>
	   "The commonly held belief that aging routinely requires pharmacological
management has unfortunately led to neglect of diet and lifestyle as the primary
means to achieve healthy aging," they wrote. "Now is an appropriate time to
reassess this emphasis."
</P>
<P>
	   Surveys by the North American Menopause Society show that about a third of
U.S. women ages 45 to 65 -- some 16 million women -- use hormone supplements,
either estrogen alone or combined with progestin.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Wolf Utian, executive director of the Menopause Society, said of the new
study, "I'd have to see another one or two papers at least before I'd accept
this as gospel."

<HEADLINE> U.S.-Libya Ties Become a Possibility  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Indications that Libya has backed away from its extended
history of radical policies are being carefully monitored by U.S. officials, who
say they are no longer inflexibly opposed to a new relationship with the
oil-rich North African country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Change can now be imagined,'' says Ronald Neumann, a top aide in the State
Department's Middle East bureau. But, he says, an accommodation with Libya ``is
not necessarily a near-term likelihood.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. willingness to reassess its policies is based largely on the decision
of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi last spring to allow two suspects wanted in the
1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 to be tried by a Scottish court sitting in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
	   Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, alleged Libyan
intelligence agents, are charged with murder and conspiracy to murder in the
Dec. 21, 1988, deaths of 259 people aboard the jetliner and 11 residents of the
Scottish village of Lockerbie.
</P>
<P>
	   In the context of U.S.-Libyan relations, the surrender of the two suspects
was an ``important threshold,'' says Herman Cohen, a former ambassador who
advocates reconciliation with Libya.
</P>
<P>
	   Neumann, who commented on the matter in a little-noticed speech in
Washington late last year, said Libya also has expelled the Abu Nidal
Organization, a militant anti-Israel group, from the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Neumann called this a ``serious, credible step'' by Libya ``to reduce its
involvement with that terrorist organization.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also took heart in Libya's decision to transfer his support from the ANO
and like-minded groups to Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser
Arafat, who has been seeking a settlement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   While characterizing these new policies as ``real and constructive
changes,'' Neumann said, ``much of the rhetoric that we see from Libya's
leadership remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As a result, we are uncertain about Libya's real intentions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the possibility of an accommodation seemed out of the question not
long ago. The two countries have been at loggerheads for most of Gadhafi's 30
years in power. Libya was the target of attacks by U.S. fighter planes twice
during the 1980's.
</P>
<P>
	   Neumann said a key test of Libya's intentions will be whether it complies
with U.N. Security Council requirements growing out of the Pan Am 103 bombing.
</P>
<P>
	   The requirements include payment of appropriate compensation to families of
the victims, cooperation with the Pan Am 103 investigation and trial, acceptance
of responsibility for the actions of its officials and a ``renunciation and end
to support of terrorism and terrorist groups.''
</P>
<P>
	   Neumann also said that unilateral U.S. sanctions against Libya, including
restrictions on trade and travel, also will remain in place at least until the
U.N. requirements are met.
</P>
<P>
	   A restoration of normal ties with Libya would allow the return of U.S. oil
companies to Libya for the first time since 1986. European companies have been
operating there without U.S. competition since then.
</P>
<P>
	   Neumann noted that there have been other sources of contention with Libya,
including its efforts to obtain missiles and weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We continue to want Libya to find a way to address these concerns,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen, the former U.S. official, believes Gadhafi has turned over a new
leaf. There was a time, Cohen recalled, when Gadhafi would give arms ``to any
revolutionary who came to his door,'' including the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
	   Those days are gone, Cohen says, adding that no terrorist incident has been
traceable to Libya over the past five years. But Libya, along with six other
counties, remains on the State Department list of sponsors of international
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
	   Since surrendering the two suspects for trial, many European countries have
reinforced diplomatic and trade ties with Libya. But efforts by Gadhafi to
wrangle an invitation from the European Union for a visit to its headquarters in
Brussels fell through over the weekend. The EU said conditions are not right for
a ``prompt and constructive visit.''

<HEADLINE> Landmark War Crimes Trial Set To End  </HEADLINE>
   By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Dusan Tadic's trial at the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal signified a landmark: the first international war crimes
prosecution since the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials in the aftermath of World War
II.
</P>
<P>
	   Now nearly four years later, the longest running case at the Yugoslav
tribunal was set to end today with an appeals ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   Tadic's case, which began May 7, 1996, has become a symbol of the sluggish
pace of justice at the U.N. tribunal, established in 1993 to prosecute suspects
of atrocities in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bosnian Serb reserve policeman was convicted in the torture and murder
of Muslims and Croats at detention camps in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
	   Initially sentenced in July 1997 to 20 years for war crimes and crimes
against humanity, Tadic had his term increased to 25 years in November by the
appeals chamber, following a prosecution appeal to reinstate dropped charges.
</P>
<P>
	   At a Jan. 14 hearing into a defense appeal against the higher sentence,
lawyer William Clegg argued that the court was putting too much emphasis on the
deterrent value of the sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's very doubtful that you can have a deterrent effect on foot soldiers
in a war situation,'' said Clegg.
</P>
<P>
	   Tadic, a former pub owner and karate instructor, was arrested by German
police in Munich on Feb. 13, 1994, after refugees recognized him from the
Omarska and Trnopolje prison camps in northwestern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the televised images of bony, emaciated detainees clinging to barbed
wire fences at those camps in 1993 that shocked the world and put pressure on
the U.N. Security Council to set up the war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
	   The opening of the case before the tribunal came as it was still struggling
to establish its credibility. That prompted allegations that the court was
making Tadic a scapegoat for the crimes of his superiors, who were still at
large. Critics echoed Tadic's lawyers' contention that he was a mere ``tadpole
in a pool of sharks.''
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Goldstone, the tribunal's first prosecutor, conceded the point in a
1996 interview.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Tadic was the only accused available to bring before the tribunal at a
time when the judges, the media, and the international community were clamoring
for us to begin prosecutions,'' the former South African judge said.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, the court has gained custody of dozens of suspects, including
several Bosnian Serb leaders held responsible for some of the worst massacres in
the 1992-95 war. So far, the court has handed down 13 convictions.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of those in custody, Gen. Momir Talic and Serb politician Radoslav
Brdjanin, allegedly masterminded the bloody ethnic purges in the area where
Tadic operated.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, NATO forces arrested another suspect on behalf of the tribunal.
Mitar Vasiljevic was captured in Visegrad on charges of torture, mass murder and
attempting to exterminate Muslim civilians in and around the eastern Bosnian
town.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 30 suspects wanted by the tribunal remain at large, including
former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his military chief, Ratko
Mladic, and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic -- wanted in connection to war
crimes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   Today's ruling effectively exhausts all of Tadic's legal recourses at the
tribunal. The appellate chamber is its court of last resort.
</P>
<P>
	   The case may be reopened only if significant new evidence is uncovered or if
judges hearing a related contempt of court proceeding against Tadic's former
lawyer, Milan Vujin, order a review. Neither scenario is likely, tribunal
officials said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Thai Rebels Storm Hospital  </HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK McDOWELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thai commandos who stormed a hospital in a hostage
rescue mission killed some of the 10 captors after they surrendered, Thai media
said today, citing hostages.
</P>
<P>
	   Thai leaders and the public, however, appeared satisfied that justice was
done when police and soldiers stormed the Ratchaburi hospital, 60 miles west of
Bangkok, on Tuesday and killed all the insurgents, who had trapped hundreds of
patients and staff. Police said all had been killed in fighting.
</P>
<P>
	   The hostage-takers were identified as members of God's Army and the Vigorous
Burmese Student Warriors, fringe rebel bands fighting the military regime in
neighboring Myanmar from the rugged jungles on Myanmar's side of the border.
</P>
<P>
	   Thai police stepped security today at Myanmar's embassy in Bangkok and along
the border to prevent revenge attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nation newspaper cited hospital officials and relatives as saying that
four patients, one of them 78 years old, had died from natural causes during the
22-hour siege. It was unclear how much the crisis contributed to their deaths.
The hostages were freed unharmed by the commando raid. Five police officers were
wounded.
</P>
<P>
	   Public reaction to the insurgents' deaths was summed up by Interior Minister
Sanan Kachornprasart in a statement bannered across the front page of The
Bangkok Post: ``They all deserved it since they've brought much trauma and
suffering to the Thai people.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Post cited hostages who said some of their captors were shot in cold
blood. One hostage, identified as a senior hospital official, said she saw
police hold the rebels at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were shot in the head after they had been told to undress and kneel
down,'' the official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities displayed the bodies of the captors, wrapped in white sheets, to
the press Tuesday before burying them without ceremony. Top police officials,
asked Tuesday whether they had been summarily executed, said they had died
fighting.
</P>
<P>
	   The Khao Sod newspaper published photos of five of the men taken before they
were shrouded. The bloody corpses were stripped to their underwear. Government
spokesman Akapol Sorasuchart said an investigation would be made into how the
photos were obtained.
</P>
<P>
	   Many patients and their relatives said the captors deserved to die. The
normally reserved prime minister, Chuan Leekpai, said they had crossed a line by
seizing a hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nation reported that a pregnant woman, who had been brought to the
hospital for a Caesarean, went into labor during the siege. She was sneaked out
an unwatched back entrance to another hospital, where she gave birth to a girl.
</P>
<P>
	   Details of the rescue began to emerge. Plainclothes police began
infiltrating the hospital -- a sprawling, 6-acre compound of 10 buildings that
the insurgents could not fully control -- dressed as patients and medical staff
hours after the siege began. They identified the number and locations of the
hostage-takers and helped sneak what patients they could to safety.
</P>
<P>
	   The insurgents, who entered from Myanmar, seized the hospital Monday to
force Thailand to aid their beleaguered movement. Their camp was under attack by
Myanmar government forces, and Thai troops had shelled them to stop them from
seeking refuge in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
	   They demanded Thailand cease the shelling and grant refuge to civilians and
combatants. Talks were held into the small hours of Tuesday, when the commandos
struck.
</P>
<P>
	   The Post reported that three hostage-takers took part in the seizure in
October of Myanmar's embassy in Bangkok by the Vigorous Burmese Student
Warriors.
</P>
<P>
	   They held some 40 people hostage for 26 hours but freed them unharmed in
exchange for a helicopter to take them to the border, where they took refuge
with God's Army, a fundamentalist Christian group of ethnic Karens led by twin
12-year-old boys believed to have mystical powers.

<HEADLINE> Highlights of Libya Evolution  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Highlights of Libya's evolution during the rule of Moammar Gadhafi and his
relations with the United States:
</P>
<P>
	   Sept. 1, 1969 -- Libyan military officers depose the conservative monarchy
of King Idris and adopt as their slogan ``socialism, unity and freedom.'' Col.
Moammar Gadhafi emerges as leader of the revolutionary government and orders the
closure of a U.S. Air Force base. The last U.S. servicemen leave in June 1970.
</P>
<P>
	   Dec. 2, 1979 -- Some 2,000 Libyans ransack the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli. They
chant support for the radical Islamic regime that had taken power in Iran
earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Aug. 12, 1981 -- President Reagan, citing alleged Libyan involvement in
terrorism, orders U.S. jets to attack targets in Libya.
</P>
<P>
	   Dec. 11, 1981 -- Concerned about the safety of Americans in Libya, the
Reagan administration asks them to leave. It also invalidates use of U.S.
passports for travel to Libya.
</P>
<P>
	   April 14, 1986 -- Convinced that Libya was responsible for a bombing at a
Berlin discotheque frequented by American servicemen, Reagan order U.S. Air
Force and Navy jets to attack five targets in Libya. An estimated 40 Libyans are
killed, including Gadhafi's baby daughter.
</P>
<P>
	   Dec. 21, 1988 -- Pan Am Flight 103, with 259 people aboard, most of them
Americans, is bombed over Lockerbie, Scotland. All aboard the U.S.-bound flight
perish, along with 11 more on the ground.
</P>
<P>
	   April 15, 1992 -- U.N. Security Council imposes arms sales and air travel
sanctions against Libya to prod Gadhafi into surrendering two suspects wanted in
the Pan Am 103 bombing.
</P>
<P>
	   April 14, 1999 -- Libya surrenders the two Libyans for trial by a Scottish
court sitting in the Netherlands. The U.N. Security Council quickly suspends
sanctions but does not lift them -- meaning they can be reimposed. The Clinton
administration says U.S. support for a formal lifting of sanctions must await
payment of appropriate compensation to families of the victims and cooperation
with the Pan Am 103 investigation and trial, consistent with U.N. Security
Council demands.

<HEADLINE> Immigrant Farmers Grow Unusual Crops  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTHA MENDOZA AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PACIFIC GROVE, Calif. (AP) -- When Efren Avalos left his home in Mexico for
a better life in the United States, he brought more than his farming skills. He
brought seeds.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, Avalos, who farms in California's lush Salinas Valley, grows a breed
of red corn common in his homeland but unavailable in local supermarkets. He
also grows small, unique tomatoes called tomatillos, an edible cactus called
nopales and special fava beans that are cooked in the pod.
</P>
<P>
	   Avalos wouldn't be growing these crops if there weren't a market. In fact,
business is booming.
</P>
<P>
	   "Although a lot of American people don't recognize my crops, we have so many
Latinos living in my area that I sell out," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Avalos is one of hundreds of immigrant farmers making a good living growing
fruits and vegetables from their homelands.
</P>
<P>
	   For Avalos, it's not just immigrants snapping up his produce. This year, he
sold 100 pounds of organic purple tomatillos a week to Whole Foods markets,
charging about $1 a pound. Whole Foods resells the tomatillos to customers for
twice that price.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wasn't sure I was going to find a market, but now I think I should plant
even more," he told farmers last week at Eco-Farm 2000, the nation's largest
annual gathering of organic farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   While Avalos grows primarily for the burgeoning Latino population in his
region, Central Valley farmers -- including thousands of Southeast Asian
immigrants -- are growing and marketing their own array of ethnic specialty
crops.
</P>
<P>
	   "Lemon grass, winter melon, red basil, bitter eggplant, lotus roots -- maybe
you never heard of this stuff, but this is what we love to grow and eat," said
Michael Yang, a Hmong immigrant who works with farmers in Fresno through the
University of California's cooperative extension program.
</P>
<P>
	   Yang said there are more than 850 Southeast Asian families farming in Fresno
County, including Hmong, Loa, Mien, Cambodian and Thai.
</P>
<P>
	   They sell their produce through wholesalers and at farmers' markets, renting
land from large property owners.
</P>
<P>
	   Because their crops are uncommon, Yang said they sometimes have a hard time
convincing brokers to buy it. However, as these items become mainstream, the
farmers have a distinct advantage over traditional farmers because they've been
growing the crops for generations, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lemon grass, for example, is traditionally used by Southeast Asians for tea,
medicine and flavoring meals. In recent years it's become a high-end product in
specialty markets, and Yang said Fresno growers are selling their lemon grass
for $180 for a 40-pound box.
</P>
<P>
	   "This has become a very good way to make a living off a small farm," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   It's not just immigrants cashing in on ethnic produce.
</P>
<P>
	   Glen Johnson, who runs Shady Glenn Farm in Nipomo said "dumb luck" led him
to the "yellow lime" market in the Latino community.
</P>
<P>
	   "I took a bucket of green limes to the farmers market and the Hispanic
customers picked through them and grabbed the ones that had already turned
yellow," he said. "Now I leave all my limes on the trees until they turn yellow
and they sell out."

<HEADLINE> Deport Case Causes Stir in Guyana  </HEADLINE>
   By BERT WILKINSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) -- Edgar Garfield Gibbons can't understand what he's
doing in Guyana.
</P>
<P>
	   He says he's a Louisiana-born car mechanic who had never left the United
States before being deported in an absurd bureaucratic blunder in April. That's
when he was freed from prison after serving a year for possessing and delivering
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
	   Guyana agrees -- and wants him returned to sender.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They met me as I was coming out of prison, took me to the airport, bought
me a drink and put me on a plane to Guyana,'' Gibbons said with a drawl. ``I had
never heard of Guyana before!''
</P>
<P>
	   Gibbons has languished in a police lockup for nine months here as his case
has gained notoriety and fueled criticism that the United States and other rich
countries are too cavalier about deporting criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   The Guyanese government, which is contending with seven more recent
deportations from Canada, announced last week it would take a tougher stance and
demand more advance warning and convincing documentation from deporting
countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Gibbons, a 41-year-old former Houston resident, met with U.S. diplomats on
Friday. A few days earlier, Guyanese officials arranged for a meeting between
him and a Guyanese woman U.S. officials believed was his cousin.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He is no relative of mine,'' Varnice Hunte announced as police looked on.
</P>
<P>
	   Hunte said she did have a cousin named Edgar Garfield Gibbons who left for
the United States with other relatives in September 1978, and she gave The
Associated Press his telephone number in East Orange, N.J.
</P>
<P>
	   That Gibbons, a telephone company employee, had not heard of the case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am Edgar Gibbons from Guyana, yes,'' he said in a British Caribbean
accent. English is the official language in Guyana. ``I have never been in any
trouble with the police, never.''
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service is now investigating the
possibility that the two -- born only five days apart -- might have been mixed
up.
</P>
<P>
	   An INS spokeswoman in Dallas, Mariela Melero, noted an immigration judge had
approved Gibbons' deportation, probably while he was still serving his sentence,
and that he was identified by photograph.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are double-checking Mr. Gibbons' file, but at this point the INS is
still standing by the fact that the man in Guyana is the man who admitted to
being a Guyanese national and asked to be deported to Belize or Guyana,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gibbons admitted making those statements, but said it was in anger and
sarcasm because officials would not believe that he was an American.
</P>
<P>
	   He says he was born Nov. 9, 1958, in Monroe, La., and moved to Houston at
age 2. A computer check by Louisiana officials turned up no birth record,
although a spokesman cautioned it might not be computerized.
</P>
<P>
	   Gibbons said his father, Byfield Gibbons, was killed in Vietnam 30 years
ago; but the Department of Defense reports no record of that name. Gibbons said
his mother, Belinda, died in 1969, and two sisters and a brother live in
England.
</P>
<P>
	   Gibbons noted that INS documents incorrectly list him as being born on Nov.
4 -- the birthdate of the man living in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   But he has no passport or other ID to back his claims.
</P>
<P>
	   Local attorneys are trying to contact the three mothers of Gibbons' three
children in the United States in hopes of turning up some proof of citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Gibbons sleeps on a sponge mattress in the police station and
spends his days chatting with officers, doing odd jobs and pressing his case
with letters and interviews. Concerned Guyanese have donated clothing,
toiletries, and food like curried chicken with roti bread.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a clear case of racism, and it is a mistake that the INS and
American officials do not want to admit,'' charged Dawn Holder, a lawyer acting
free of charge for Gibbons, who is black.

<HEADLINE> Oilers 5, Canucks 4, OT  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Ethan Moreau scored with a minute left
in overtime Tuesday night, lifting the Edmonton Oilers to a 5-4 victory over the
Vancouver Canucks.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Poti, skating up the left boards, centered a pass to Moreau who fired a
shot between Vancouver goalie Garth Snow's legs as the Oilers won their first
overtime game in a league-high 21 tries this season. The Oilers are now 1-7-13
in overtime games this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Pat Falloon, who forced OT by scoring with 80 seconds left in regulation,
Roman Hamrlik, Doug Weight and Jim Down also scored for the Oilers. Hamrlik
finished with a goal and three assists as the Oilers took over sole possession
of eighth place in the Western Conference standings, two points ahead of the
idle Los Angeles Kings.
</P>
<P>
	   Markus Naslund had a goal and an assist, while Adrian Aucoin, Darby
Hendrickson and Matt Cooke also scored for the Canucks, 0-4-2 in their last six
games. Vancouver hasn't won at home since beating Washington on Dec. 22, going
0-6-2 over that stretch.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oilers finish capped a wild game in which the two teams combined for
seven goals in the first period, after which Vancouver led 4-3, when Hendrickson
scored with 1:42 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
	   The four-goal first period was the most the Canucks have scored in one
period this season. The Oilers, meanwhile, had not given up four or more goals
in either of their last nine games.
</P>
<P>
	   The first period featured seven goals on a combined 22 shots, Vancouver's
Donald Brashear and Edmonton's Georges Laraque squaring off for a fight three
seconds into the game; three goals over a 105-second span; and two lead changes.
</P>
<P>
	   Sixty-nine seconds after Weight scored a power-play goal tying the game at
2-2, the Oilers went ahead when Dowd scored on a breakaway at 11:21 of the first
period.
</P>
<P>
	   The Canucks responded, tying the game on Cooke's goal with 4:03 left in the
period. When Artem Chubarov's shot went wide and bounced off the end boards,
Cooke raced to the net and tapped the puck in, ending Bill Ranford's night.
</P>
<P>
	   Ranford, making his first start in 11 games, has now given up 11 goals on
the last 39 shots he has faced. In his last outing, Ranford gave up eight goals
on 32 shots in an 8-2 loss to Los Angeles on Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
	   Tommy Salo, who allowed one goal on 18 shots, picked up the win.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wedged between the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire
primary, President Clinton grabs the spotlight Thursday night with a State of
the Union address intended to promote the last year of his presidency and the
political ambitions of his partner, Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   It will be a speech watched by millions of Americans, probably Clinton's
biggest audience of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton will boast about the nation's extraordinary prosperity, which in
February will turn into the longest economic expansion in history. He'll catalog
hundreds of billions of dollars worth of programs he'd like to see Congress
approve to crown the final year of his presidency -- from health insurance and
medical research to education initiatives and tax breaks for the working poor.
</P>
<P>
	   It's Clinton's night and his big speech. But the president probably will be
thinking, at least in part, about how his remarks could help Gore, the man
sitting behind him at the rostrum of the cavernous House chamber. Five days
before the New Hampshire primary, Gore will rush back to Washington to occupy
that seat and lead the applause for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   White House officials return the favor by keeping Gore's needs in mind.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked which team Clinton favors in the Super Bowl, presidential spokesman
Joe Lockhart turned to his staff and asked jokingly, ``What do you think the
vice president wants him to say?''
</P>
<P>
	   One of the most important contributions Clinton can make to his legacy is to
help Gore become president and carry on the work of the Clinton-Gore
administration. It is a factor in developing Clinton's own agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're not going to jeopardize the Gore campaign in any way with any
initiatives that might be politically unattractive to Gore,'' said political
scientist Shirley Anne Warshaw of Gettysburg College.
</P>
<P>
	   But on the other hand, she said, that doesn't mean Gore gets to write
Clinton's script. ``This is still the Clinton administration and they are very
firmly in charge.''
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas E. Mann, senior fellow at the Brookings Institutions, said Clinton
will make sure that Gore is protected. ``You proceed with your presidency but
check what you propose to do against its likely impact on the Gore candidacy,''
Mann said. ``The object is to do no harm -- and preferably to do some help.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Gore also realizes the strongest thing going for him in this election are
the governing successes of the Clinton administration and the broad successes in
the economy and improvements in American society,'' Mann said. ``It would be
foolish to run away from those.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also has his mind on the Senate race of his wife, Hillary. ``I think
she's done a good job with this and she's getting into it,'' he said Tuesday.
``I think it would be a good thing for New York and a good thing for our
country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Even before his speech, Clinton went out of his way to credit Gore for some
of the administration's big-ticket proposals. The president said, for example,
that it was Gore who persuaded him to expand a health care program for needy
children to include their parents, as well. ``I thank the vice president for
this proposal,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockhart said Clinton's administration was ``not in the business of
micromanaging our policies to try to help or hurt any campaign.'' But he
acknowledged there is coordination between the Clinton and Gore teams.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There always is. We talk to their staff all the time,'' Lockhart said.
``But the agenda that the president's going to lay out is the president's
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
	   The spokesman would not say how much of it came from Gore. ``There's a long
list of people in that category who want things,'' he said, but it is the
president who decides how to lay out the speech.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton will offer a boost in the minimum wage, a prescription drug benefit
under Medicare, tougher gun controls and a patients' bill of rights. In health
care coverage, alone, Clinton is proposing a $110 billion initiative -- saying
it would be the largest investment in health coverage since Medicare was
established in 1965.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans say this isn't the time for big, new initiatives because of the
elections; an election year like this one isn't the right time for big, new
initiatives. But Clinton is pretending he didn't hear their advice.
</P>
<P>
	   For weeks, the White House has been dribbling out details of Clinton's
proposals in ``leaks'' to the media in hopes of getting more attention. There
have been so many leaks that the Republican-run House Budget Committee has
redesigned its web page to poke fun at the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Under a section headed ``White House budget leaks,'' the committee keeps a
running tab of the cost of Clinton proposals ``tallied from about 50 leaks.''
The latest estimate was that Clinton's program would increase spending next year
by $30.4 billion over current totals.

<HEADLINE> Gotti's son-in-law indicted on racketeering rap  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - It was, suggested a prosecutor, like an episode of "The
Sopranos." Except this production, made with police audio and video equipment,
landed mob boss John Gotti's son-in-law behind bars.
<P>
	   Reputed mobster Carmine Agnello, the husband of best-selling author and
dapper daughter Victoria Gotti, was arrested Tuesday for allegedly using
extortion and arson to frighten a Queens business competitor.
</P>
<P>
	   Unfortunately for Agnello, authorities said, the competition was a police
sting operation set up in the hope of catching car thieves.
</P>
<P>
	   "Thereupon began a saga worthy of an episode of 'The Sopranos,"' said Queens
District Attorney Richard Brown.
</P>
<P>
	   The recording equipment allegedly caught Agnello threatening undercover
police officers - a surprise to authorities, who said their target was the
stolen car business in Queens, not the Gotti relative.
</P>
<P>
	   Agnello, 40, and three associates face up to 29 years in prison and the loss
of millions of dollars in assets if convicted, Brown and Police Commissioner
Howard Safir told a joint news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Agnello could personally lose his $4 million Long Island mansion, which he
put up in 1998 as bail for his since-jailed brother-in-law, John A. "Junior"
Gotti.
</P>
<P>
	   Agnello was "long believed to run the automobile crime and auto theft
business on behalf of organized crime," Brown said.
</P>
<P>
	   The suspect was arrested near his opulent home in Old Westbury.
</P>
<P>
	   His wife has said in the past that her husband was targeted because of his
infamous in-laws. Agnello's attorney, Marvyn Kornberg, did not immediately
return a call for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the indictment, Agnello and his co-defendants repeatedly
targeted a neighboring scrap metal company in the Willets Point section of
Queens for firebombing and intimidation.
</P>
<P>
	   Stadium Scrap, set up near Shea Stadium in April 1999, was an operation
fully run by undercover police from the Auto Crime Division. Agnello appeared
the next month, threatening the new business, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   Forty-eight other suspects were arrested on unrelated charges during the
lengthy investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Agnello was charged with the state equivalent of racketeering, along with
various auto-related crimes such as insurance fraud and criminal possession of
stolen property.
</P>
<P>
	   Ex-FBI Gambino Squad head Bruce Mouw said last year that Agnello was a
legitimate businessman who became a self-made millionaire - but still insisted
on becoming a made man, a ceremony that took place in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of these guys want to get made, and common sense doesn't prevail,"
Mouw said.
</P>
<P>
	   Agnello married Ms. Gotti, the Dapper Don's second daughter, in 1984. The
couple has three sons.
</P>
<P>
	   Charged with Agnello were Queens residents Joseph "Jumbo" Burger, 43, Mark
Lomonaco, 35, and Steven Scala, 37. Burger was ordered held on $1 million bail;
the other two were awaiting arraignment.

<HEADLINE> Snowplow accident kills one as surprise storm hits eastern New  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. (AP) - A collision with a snow plow on the Thruway
killed a driver and left six of her relatives seriously injured Tuesday as a
surprising nor'easter brought up to 14 inches of snow to the Hudson Valley.
<P>
	   In many areas of eastern New York, traffic was light on the heavily snowed
roads that crews worked overtime to clear. Businesses closed, flights were
grounded, and hundreds of schools canceled classes - distressing some students
who had prepared for Regents tests.
</P>
<P>
	   The widespread storm with heavy, wind-driven snow rushed up the coast and
buried New England after dumping a record 18 inches of snow on North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   An inch or two more is expected today in central and eastern New York, and
forecasters said there's a chance Syracuse could get a particularly hard blast
from the lake effect.
</P>
<P>
	   Catherine Simmons, 61, of Kingston, died after she lost control of her
vehicle and rammed into the back of a snowplow around 2 p.m. in Saugerties,
state police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Maryann Merritt, 35, of Troy, and five other relatives, ages 5, 8, 9, 12 and
16, were transported to area hospitals. The plow driver was uninjured, according
to officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Slick conditions shut down the Taconic State Parkway south of Interstate 84
Tuesday from 8 a.m. until after 1 p.m., according to state officials.
</P>
<P>
	   "There were vehicles sliding off the roadway," said Purdy Halstead,
assistant to the regional director of the DOT.
</P>
<P>
	   The DOT also closed a stretch of Route 9G in Staatsburg for about an hour
after a car carrier swerving to avoid another car overturned on the shoulder.
Hyde Park police reported no injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   In most areas, officials said drivers avoided going out.
</P>
<P>
	   "They've closed the world so no one is on the highways," DeWitt Sagendorph,
coordinator of Dutchess County's Emergency Response Department, told the
Poughkeepsie Journal.
</P>
<P>
	   In Greene County, which had the greatest accumulation with 14 inches in East
Jewett, sheriff's deputies reported a relatively quiet night, and crews
continued removing snow even around 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   In Hyde Park, Rotterdam and the town of Catskill, the National Weather
Service said 10 inches of snow piled up. Albany received 7.6 inches by 10:30
p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   In a rare twist, some students were upset that classes - and tests - were
canceled.
</P>
<P>
	   "I heard it on the radio in the morning and was disappointed," high school
senior Linda Angarita, who was prepared to take one of the Regents exams, said.
"I was looking forward to taking it because I wanted to get it over with."
</P>
<P>
	   Most students will now have to wait until June or August to take the tests,
state education officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Wappingers, district officials waited until the last possible minute
before canceling Regents tests.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our original announcement was if you make it in, we'll give you the test,"
said Superintendent Wayne Gersen. "Then, we decided when snow was accumulating
rapidly to cancel the exams. About five students showed up."
</P>
<P>
	   And the harsh January weather could mean more bad news for summer. Some
school districts' allotment of snow days has been depleted, meaning another bout
of bad weather could bring shorter spring vacations.
</P>
<P>
	   But 10-year-old Albany resident Anathea Gil was not worried about that
Tuesday. Instead, she profited from the weather, earning $21 for shoveling
neighbor's walkways.
</P>
<P>
	   She planned to add the money from other snowfalls to spend on a birthday
party for her dog. With Tuesday's take, she said, "We're inviting EVERY single
dog in the neighborhood."
</P>
<P>
	   Checker Cab drivers in Albany were out to make a buck too, despite dangerous
road conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's too good a tip day - people love you when you get someplace,"
dispatcher Zeke Marlaland said. "They're aggravated that it takes so long, but
they're happy when they see that red cab pull up and they're happy when they get
where they're going."
</P>
<P>
	   In Schenectady, Revere Video employee Joyce Hoffman also worked through the
storm. As snowbound families sought entertainment, copies of "Runaway Bride"
disappeared by early afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   "It has been a busy day," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   State emergency management officials had staff on hand at their Albany
headquarters overnight, but on Tuesday evening reported no major requests from
counties for help.
</P>
<P>
	   Albany airport officials said 95 percent of flights were canceled.
</P>
<P>
	   At Stewart International Airport, to the south, most flights took off with
only minor delays, except for those canceled because they were destined for
regions to the south and east.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche 4, Sharks 3  </HEADLINE>
    By DENNIS GEORGATOS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Chris Drury scored the go-ahead goal with 13:57
remaining and then assisted on a power-play score as the Colorado Avalanche beat
the San Jose Sharks 4-3 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharks rookie goaltender Evgeni Nabokov, who had a 39-save shutout during a
scoreless tie in his first NHL start at Colorado on Jan. 19, didn't come close
to duplicating the effort in the rematch. He had 20 saves while facing 24 shots.
</P>
<P>
	   Colorado goaltender Patrick Roy, who registered his 47th career shutout in
his last game against the Sharks, had 25 saves to remain unbeaten in his last
nine starts (6-0-3). Two of the stops came in the final 45 seconds after the
Sharks pulled their goaltender in favor of an extra attacker.
</P>
<P>
	   Owen Nolan scored two goals, including a slapshot at the end of a breakaway
with 4:04 remaining to boost his season total to 32, a new franchise record. He
eclipsed Jeff Friesen's 31 during the 1997-98 season.
</P>
<P>
	   Drury snapped a tie with his 14th goal, driving the puck into net with a
slapshot from between the faceoff circles.
</P>
<P>
	   Just over three minutes later, Drury sent a pass across the crease and
streaking Milan Hejduk pulled up in front of the net to knock the puck past
Nabokov for what proved to be the game-winner. It was Colorado's first win in
the past four games.
</P>
<P>
	   Colorado took a 2-1 lead on a tremendous effort by Peter Forsberg. Taking a
lead pass at the red line from Joe Sakic, Forsberg sped down the ice ahead of
San Jose's defenders and circled behind the net, beating Nabokov with a
wraparound shot at 8:09 of the second.
</P>
<P>
	   But San Jose tied it at 2 on Nolan's 31st goal of the season. He sent a
forehand shot past Roy from the top of the right faceoff circle after Vincent
Damphousse banged the puck out from a scramble along the boards.
</P>
<P>
	   San Jose caught Roy away from the net but lost a chance to take the lead
late in the second period when Ron Sutter was called for goaltender
interference, negating Tony Granato's shot into an empty net.
</P>
<P>
	   The teams traded goals in the first period. San Jose opened the scoring
15:51 into the game when Stephane Matteau, off a centering pass from Jeff
Norton, hit backhand shot from the slot past Roy.
</P>
<P>
	   Less than two minutes later, the Avalanche evened the score as Alexei
Gusarov broke through for his second goal of the season, knocking the puck into
the net after getting a feed from Forsberg.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Grandmothers To Meet Elian  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The grandmothers of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez are ready
to head to Florida for a government-ordered session with the Cuban boy while
political maneuvering intensifies over legislation to make him a U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
	   The two women made an impassioned appeal to Congress on Tuesday not to pass
such a bill, saying Elian was a Cuban citizen and belonged with his father and
them in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's our right to see our grandson and take him back home,'' Mariela
Quintana, the child's paternal grandmother, said during a visit to Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   They won't be able to do that at today's session with Elian in Miami,
however. The meeting, planned for 4 p.m. EST, was set as just a visit by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service after efforts by the grandmothers to see
their grandson in Miami on Monday fell through.
</P>
<P>
	   They still looked forward to the visit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know if I'll cry or if I'll laugh'' when seeing Elian for the
first time in more than two months, Raquel Rodriquez, Elian's maternal
grandmother, told CNN late Tuesday after the INS ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton supported the grandmother's cause, hinting he might veto
the citizenship legislation if it passes. And those in the Senate seeking
Elian's repatriation to Cuba suggested they might use delaying tactics,
including a filibuster, to keep the Senate from debating the measure.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The idea that the Senate and the House of Representatives is going to
determine the fate of a 6-year-old is pathetic,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian belongs with his father and grandmothers, Dodd said. ``We can have
good families in bad countries,'' he said after a meeting with the grandmothers.
``This is a good family.''
</P>
<P>
	   The snowstorm that gripped Washington, as well as much of the Atlantic
seaboard, and the rising combativeness of those opposing the citizenship bill
prompted Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., to put off trying to bring
the measure up until next week.
</P>
<P>
	   Lott earlier had said it could come up as early as today.
</P>
<P>
	   That same snowstorm also was making it unclear exactly when the grandmothers
would be able to leave for Miami, since Washington-area airports were mostly
shut down Tuesday. The grandmothers and their representatives said they would
leave for Miami today at the first opportunity.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS, which is part of the Justice Department, announced late Tuesday
that Elian's Florida family had agreed to today's visit. Earlier in the day the
INS had said it had the authority to order the family to agree to the meeting
under the arrangement by which the boy has been allowed to stay in this country
pending further immigration proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The meeting will take place at the time and site selected by the
Immigration Service,'' Justice spokeswoman Carole Florman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Florman said the government had reassured the relatives that today's session
at the Miami Beach home of the president of a Dominican college would be just a
visit and would not result in Elian's being taken back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers will see Elian privately, but the boy's Florida relatives
will be nearby in the house at the time, Florman said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Miami, the lead attorney for Elian's relatives, Spencer Eig, said,
``Elian has stated that he's a little bit afraid to go all by himself because
he's afraid they might be forced to take him back to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said today's visit was expected to last two hours and called the INS
``heavy handed'' in its dealings.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS has ruled that the boy should be returned to his father in Cuba.
Elian's Florida relatives have challenged the order in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy was found clinging to a life preserver in the Atlantic on Nov. 25
after his mother and 10 others died when their boat sank en route from Cuba to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The two grandmothers made the rounds of Capitol Hill on Tuesday, meeting
with legislators sympathetic to their wish to have Elian returned to Cuba and
their opposition to congressionally imposed citizenship on Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., said the grandmothers told them Elian's mother was
on the ill-fated boat not to flee Castro's oppression but because of pressure
from her boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We asked some rather pointed questions,'' Hagel said. ``She was forced on
that boat.''
</P>
<P>
	   Versions of the citizenship bill are before both the House and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   The measure, drafted by members of the Florida congressional delegation,
would confer U.S. citizenship on Elian, thus removing the INS jurisdiction from
the case.

<HEADLINE> First intense winter storm hits New York City  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - For some, it was a work of art - but for most, it was
just extra work.
<P>
	   New York's second snowstorm of the season left a 4-inch blanket of flakes in
Central Park on Tuesday. And though the snow helped raise the spirits of many,
more than 1,500 snowplows and salt spreaders were hard at work clearing the
roads and sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
	   "We need more of this. It adds beauty to this place, it adds life. It's
creative," said West Side doorman Rudy Williams. "This here is a winter's work
of art!"
</P>
<P>
	   But for a runner in Central Park, it was a workout too slippery to handle.
</P>
<P>
	   "My running shoes are no match for the snow. I was sliding and sliding,"
said Susan Dillon, 29, who never completed her morning run.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm was the cause of at least one fatality in the city. Rocco
Marabello, 58, of Staten Island, died after suffering a heart attack while
shoveling snow.
</P>
<P>
	   Snowfall in the area ranged from nearly 6 inches in the Westchester town of
White Plains, to about 4 inches in Nassau County on Long Island and slightly
more in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
	   Even high in the Manhattan sky, several inches of snow caked on window
sills. Fog and flurries enveloped the Empire State Building observatory, forcing
the closure of the outdoor section.
</P>
<P>
	   "We heard that in America you could do whatever you want whenever you want,
so we're rather disappointed," said Faye Roberton, of Worthing, England, who
made it to the top of the skyscraper but wasn't allowed outside.
</P>
<P>
	   Down on the ground, the white stuff didn't stay white for very long.
</P>
<P>
	   Broadway was already a brownish slush-fest for cars during the Tuesday
morning rush, just hours after the flakes began falling at 5:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   By 10 a.m., the snow had turned to sleet and freezing rain throughout the
region. The wintery weather continued through the day with more flurries, wind
gusts of up to 50 mph, and coastal flooding in the evening.
</P>
<P>
	   Weather officials said the morning snowstorm - which closed hundreds of
public schools in the suburbs, and some private and parochial schools in the
city - had developed more quickly than expected.
</P>
<P>
	   La Guardia Airport closed at 7 a.m.; one of its two runways reopened at 1:30
p.m. Delays of up to 90 minutes were reported at Kennedy and Newark airports.
</P>
<P>
	   "They did not announce the flight was canceled till well after 8 o'clock. We
were scheduled to leave at 7," said retired businessman Nate Safferstein of the
Bronx, who had hoped to get from La Guardia to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., with his
wife, Bernice.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor urged employers to stagger afternoon closings to ease the
rush-hour burden on the subways, buses and commuter lines.
</P>
<P>
	   People heading home early kicked off the Grand Central Terminal rush before
3 p.m. - about an hour earlier than usual.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd rather stay at work, because once you get in to work, you want to put
in the time," said Manley Klaleel, who was headed home to Westchester County
after half a day. "But there's nobody to do business with, so I'm headed home."
</P>
<P>
	   In Westchester, a water main burst Tuesday morning, flooding the Bronx River
Parkway and several Yonkers streets for hours and causing water problems for
tens of thousands of Mount Vernon residents.
</P>
<P>
	   In nearby New Rochelle, Jamaire Elegant, 16, faced a lineup of games at the
New Roc City entertainment complex: "No school, bad weather and I've got $11 in
my pocket."
</P>
<P>
	   The storm also stirred up love.
</P>
<P>
	   David and Amanda Howard, of London, tied the knot at Grand Central, on a
balcony of Michael Jordan's Steak House. The bride's bouquet matched the
weather: white roses.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was woken up this morning, and they told me the other minister couldn't
make it because of the weather," said the Rev. Paula Posman. "So I said, 'Relax.
You can get married. Take a breath."'

    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Is it her gender? The hairdo? Maybe she's just too
tall. Or too short.
<P>
	   On Tuesday, expected Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton said some
people may dislike her because she is a woman in public life, or because of her
hair.
</P>
<P>
	   She later said she was "kidding" about the gender remark, but added that "it
would be great if New York joined the rest of the country in electing a woman
statewide."
</P>
<P>
	   New York has never independently elected a woman to statewide office. Three
women have been elected lieutenant governor, but they ran as part of a ticket
where voters cast one ballot for governor and lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
	   During a morning interview with Albany's WGY-AM radio, Mrs. Clinton was told
that "in certain circles, just mention your name and you've got foaming at the
mouth."
</P>
<P>
	   After momentary laughter from Mrs. Clinton, she was asked whether she "ever
tried to understand that venom and does it bother you?"
</P>
<P>
	   "I know that it's out there and I think some of it is because of the
positions that I've taken and maybe a little of it is because I'm a woman taking
those positions," the first lady said with a serious tone.
</P>
<P>
	   "And, maybe some of it is people don't like my hair style. I don't know what
it is," she said, her voice taking on a lighthearted cast as she said that she
had sported her current hairdo "long enough. I'll probably get ready to change."
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Mrs. Clinton said she had been kidding when she made the gender
remark and really had no way of knowing why people might not like her.
</P>
<P>
	   "Maybe I'm not tall enough. Maybe I'm not short enough. You don't know," she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   But an aide to her expected Republican Senate rival, New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, was quick to jump on the gender remark.
</P>
<P>
	   "First, it was a right-wing conspiracy. Then, we were told about a secret
network of extremists. Now, Mrs. Clinton is blaming her campaign woes on her
gender. What's next?" Giuliani aide Bruce Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some recent polls have shown Mrs. Clinton running almost even with Giuliani
among female voters. Those same polls showed the mayor leading among white women
voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Given that, independent pollster Lee Miringoff said it is little wonder that
Mrs. Clinton might try to appeal to women voters by portraying herself as a
victim of gender discrimination.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's been an eroding of the gender gap," the head of Marist College's
Institute for Public Opinion said. "Clearly, she needs to win and win big among
women to be successful."
</P>
<P>
	   During an appearance before school superintendents from across the state,
the first lady leveled her harshest attack yet on school vouchers, a Giuliani
favorite. She called vouchers "gimmicks" that "divide our communities."
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no evidence that they work. There is evidence that they drain
dollars and students from the public schools when we need those dollars and
students," she said as the more than 200 superintendents offered sustained
applause.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have real problems that demand action, not rhetoric or political
posturing ... Will you spend your time firing people or fixing our schools? Will
you work to sell off the school board building or invest in our children?" Mrs.
Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani supporters on the New York City school board recently ousted
schools Chancellor Rudy Crew, and the mayor proposed moving the Board of
Education's offices into a smaller building. Giuliani has called for mayoral
control over the schools as a way to make them better.

<HEADLINE> Both Democrats and Republicans skeptical about superagency  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki's chief law enforcement official
has assured state legislators that no crime-fighting emphasis will be lost if
they agree to the governor's proposed creation of a super law enforcement agency
in state government.
<P>
	   Katherine Lapp tried to sell doubtful legislators Tuesday on the wisdom of
rolling the state Department of Correctional Services, the state Division of
Parole, the State Police and other criminal justice-related agencies into a new
Department of Justice. Officials said the consolidation would allow the
elimination of 180 full-time positions - in a new superagency employing 44,000
people - and save the state $10 million a year.
</P>
<P>
	   State Sen. Dale Volker, an Erie County Republican, said at a legislative
hearing on Pataki's $76.8 billion budget plan that he was worried that to
approve the plan as proposed would give the Pataki administration an
extraordinary ability, at least initially, to spend $2.18 billion with little or
no legislative oversight.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's a little bit of a problem, at least it seems to me to be and to a
lot of us who have been in criminal justice for a long time," Volker told Lapp.
</P>
<P>
	   For instance, Volker said it appeared that "you could transfer a great many
people out of the State Police and decimate the numbers of the State Police ...
without any legislative authorization."
</P>
<P>
	   Volker said he did not believe Pataki, a fellow Republican, would do any
such thing. But he also noted that Pataki will not be governor forever.
</P>
<P>
	   Legislative staffers evaluating the Pataki initiative have found only three
other states have tried a similar consolidation: Kentucky, Massachusetts and
Hawaii. All three states are tiny compared with New York, Volker said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki is asking for special discretion to spend the money normally
allocated to the various state agencies involved in the consolidation. Lapp said
that latitude will be needed at least during the first year as the
administration sets up the new Department of Justice and rearranges
responsibilities within the new superagency.
</P>
<P>
	   Lapp told Volker she understood his concerns and would be willing to give
legislators assurances that no major changes would be made in the traditional
services offered by the affected agencies.
</P>
<P>
	   "The intent was to allow the flexibility needed during a consolidation," she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   No uniformed state employees would lose their jobs because of the
consolidation, Lapp said.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic Assemblyman Alexander Grannis of Manhattan said New York City,
among other governments, has tried large-scale consolidations of agencies and
found that they sometimes do not work. He said he was concerned that a
Department of Justice would not give the proper attention to some of the duties
of agencies which become component parts, such as parole services.
</P>
<P>
	   "Very large doesn't necessarily lead to a better delivery model," Grannis
said.

<HEADLINE> Judge: allow television coverage of Diallo trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Although a judge surprisingly ruled to allow a
television camera in the trial of Amadou Diallo's alleged killers, court experts
warn other New York trials might not immediately be seen on the small screen.
<P>
	   Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi said New York's law banning cameras from
the courtroom is unconstitutional and Court TV will be allowed to broadcast the
Diallo trial beginning with opening arguments. "The denial of access to the vast
majority will accomplish nothing but more divisiveness," Teresi said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Teresi said his ruling should apply not only to the Diallo
trial but to all other trials in the state. However, it was unclear whether an
Albany judge's ruling would be binding on other judges around the state.
</P>
<P>
	   "A court in Buffalo will probably take note of the order issued by the
learned Judge Teresi but say, 'I'm not bound by this order and I'm free to
reconsider this issue and I respectively disagree,"' said James Acker, a
professor at the State University of New York at Albany. "I think that the other
judges are certainly not bound by Teresi's order."
</P>
<P>
	   Court TV had asked Teresi to allow a camera into the courtroom when he
presides over the trial of the four police officers accused of killing the West
African immigrant. The judge ruled that one of the cable network's cameras can
record the proceedings and that Court TV must share the feed with other
networks.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're delighted that Judge Teresi has affirmed the right of open courtroom
proceedings in New York state," said Henry Schleiff, Court TV's chairman and
chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
	   Allowing the trial to be televised will "further the interests of justice,
enhance public understanding of the judicial system and maintain a high level of
public confidence in the judiciary," Teresi wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   No mention was made of allowing a still camera into the trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard N. Winfield, an attorney for the Associated Press, said the news
cooperative and a group of newspapers were studying the ruling "and were
contemplating seeking a clarification from Judge Teresi that would enable a
still camera pool to cover the trial."
</P>
<P>
	   A Bronx judge refused another network's request to allow television coverage
of the trial. But a state appeals court moved the officers' trial to Albany
after defense lawyers argued that a fair and impartial jury could not be
assembled in the Bronx, allowing Court TV to make its request to a different
judge. Jury selection begins Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   A grand jury indicted the plain clothes officers in March 1999 after they
fired 41 bullets at Diallo, an unarmed street vendor from West Africa, while
searching a Bronx neighborhood for a rape suspect on Feb. 4, 1999. Diallo was
hit by 19 bullets.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for the officers - Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and
Richard Murphy - have said their clients mistakenly believed the victim was
reaching for a gun. The four officers were charged with second-degree murder.
All pleaded innocent.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense lawyer Stephen Worth, who represents McMellon, said the defense had
no immediate plans to appeal. "We respect his ruling and this will probably be a
good thing for everyone," Worth said. "I think this will stop this issue that in
any way things are being hidden and that once the public sees all the evidence
they're going to understand why these officers did what they did."
</P>
<P>
	   Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson generally supports having cameras in
courtrooms, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer will not appeal Teresi's ruling either,
spokesman Marc Violette said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is not uncommon for the attorney general not to be allowed in a
challenge of the constitutionality of state laws," Violette said. However,
Spitzer will reevaluate if the issue gets appealed to the state Court of Appeal,
the state's highest court.
</P>
<P>
	   It has been almost three years since trials and criminal court hearings were
televised in New York. Audio and video recording was first allowed into New
York's trial courts in 1987, but only on an experimental basis.
</P>
<P>
	   The last extender expired in June 1997 and state lawmakers have, thus far,
refused to renew the law allowing television and audio recording equipment back
into the state's trial courts.

<HEADLINE> State election officials to decide on McCain challenges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Sen. John McCain, looking for a boost for his
presidential hopes, should find out today how many New York Republicans will get
to see his name on the ballot for the state's March 7 GOP presidential primary.
<P>
	   McCain was knocked off the ballot in three congressional districts this week
by local election officials after state Republicans challenged the signatures on
the Arizona senator's presidential petitions.
</P>
<P>
	   The four-member state Board of Elections today will hear eight more
challenges to McCain's presidential petitions. On the four-member Board of
Elections - two Democrats and two Republicans - three votes are required to
declare petitions invalid.
</P>
<P>
	   State Republican leaders, who support Texas Gov. George W. Bush, had
challenged McCain's petitions in 16 of New York's 31 congressional districts,
claiming he failed to obtain the required number of signatures from party
members.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain will not sue to overturn the dismissals for the South Bronx and
Suffolk County districts, McCain campaign lawyer Henry Berger said. However, any
other possible disqualification will be challenged, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, in the 12th Congressional District covering parts of Manhattan,
Brooklyn and Queens, McCain is only missing one signature. That signature was
disqualified because the signer put the wrong house number on the petition,
Berger said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are one short because of a technicality," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   That one will be challenged in court, Berger said.
</P>
<P>
	   With polls showing McCain running ahead of Bush in New Hampshire, the battle
over the New York primary ballot has taken on extra significance.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, GOP candidates must get a certain number of signatures from
party members to qualify for separate convention delegate slates in each of the
state's 31 congressional districts in which they wish to compete. In effect,
there are 31 separate GOP primaries in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Should the challenges be upheld by the state Board of Elections, and
possibly by state courts thereafter, McCain could be without convention delegate
slates in more than half of the state.
</P>
<P>
	   The board hopes to certify the New York primary ballot by Jan. 31, but court
challenges could delay the final primary ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has also sued to get on the New York primary ballot. McCain's lawsuit
will be heard in federal court in Brooklyn Friday at 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also faces some petition challenges of his own from publisher Steve
Forbes in six New York City congressional districts. "We are highly, highly
confident we will prevail," said Jeff Buley, who works for the state Republican
Committee in support of Bush.

<HEADLINE> Bank, internet firm agree to curbs on releasing personal data  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The Harvard Law Journal argued for greater diligence
against businesses that violate privacy. That was in 1890.
<P>
	   In the age of the Internet - when data from bank balances and cellular phone
calls are a few keystrokes and a few dollars away - State Attorney General Eliot
Spitzer said protections against invasive firms must evolve too.
</P>
<P>
	   He seeks to require purveyors of personal information to get a consumer's
permission before it can be released. Currently, a consumer must take action to
be precluded from these lucrative lists
</P>
<P>
	   Two state settlements announced Tuesday will form a basis for some of this
reform under proposed laws.
</P>
<P>
	   In one, Chase Manhattan Bank has agreed to stop providing credit line and
balance information for as many as 22 million credit card holders, the attorney
general said.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank was providing information despite a privacy policy given to
customers. The information that included "encrypted account numbers" and loan
numbers was provided to marketing firms. Customers could then be called by the
marketers pitching emergency road service plans, discount shopping clubs, legal
services, travel clubs, garden supplies and magazine subscriptions, according to
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Chase would get a commission on sales, said bank spokesman Jim Finn. Finn
and Spitzer said they didn't know how much Chase made in commissions.
</P>
<P>
	   Chase will pay $101,500 for the cost of the state investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank emphasized that there was nothing illegal about its past policy.
Chase voluntarily imposed a moratorium on the marketing practice in July, Finn
said. The bank denies violating any consumer protection laws.
</P>
<P>
	   He also noted that the policy provided to customers reserved the right to
refer client information to firms if the bank felt its customers would be
interested in the products.
</P>
<P>
	   InfoBeat also had a privacy policy for its customers who signed on to the
computer e-mail service. It stated that InfoBeat wouldn't provide e-mail
addresses of its 2 million customers directly to its advertisers. But a computer
"software glitch" transmitted e-mail addresses directly to its advertisers,
according to Spitzer. A Spitzer aide said the company's marketing department
wrote the policy, but its computer programmers apparently didn't know about it
and allowed the information to pass unrestricted.
</P>
<P>
	   InfoBeat's policy stated it "will never release, sell or give a subscriber's
name or e-mail address to any other party or organization, without the
subscriber's explicit permission."
</P>
<P>
	   InfoBeat will pay $75,000 to cover the state investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   In both cases, the state's attorneys argued that the company's own written
policies were violated. Spitzer admits that if there was no policy, the cases
would have been harder to pursue.
</P>
<P>
	   That points to the need for legislation to protect information consumers
submit to companies and the record of Internet use on "browsers" that provide a
way to navigate the system, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is no longer just Big Brother we need to worry about, it's Big Browser,"
Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that for $100 a wife beater could locate his wife's phone number,
even if unlisted or cellular, and who she called. A prospective employer could
also hire a service for a small fee to find out what books a job applicant had
purchased online.
</P>
<P>
	   "Do we want to live in this kind of society?" Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer applauded Chase and InfoBeat for agreeing to what the state hopes is
a new standard. But it's just a start.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, Chase can continue to provide the name, address and telephone
numbers of customers to other firms. It can also share the additional
information - regarding credit and spending - to its own financial affiliates,
according to the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Senate pushes for release of oil reserves to cut prices  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson may take
action as early as today to stem a rapid rise in fuel prices across New York.
<P>
	   The issue that's drawn calls for federal action from top state Democratic
and Republican leaders will soon be felt in the state's 3 million homes heated
by oil.
</P>
<P>
	   A typical New York state family's home heating oil bill was about $360 last
January. This month, it is headed to $680, a retailer said.
</P>
<P>
	   State Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno is the latest to join the effort
to get the federal government to release part of its crude oil reserves. The
increased supply is expected to reduce prices. The state Assembly on Monday
plans to match the resolution approved by the Senate on Tuesday for the release
of the reserves.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican Gov. George Pataki and U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, a Democrat,
have also both called for the federally held oil to be made available.
</P>
<P>
	   The price for home heating oil in New York state rose from an average of 90
cents a gallon to as much as $1.70 a gallon - mostly in the last two cold weeks,
according to government and business surveys.
</P>
<P>
	   The increase has been blamed on factors ranging from a harsh European winter
that has sapped U.S. supplies to a frozen Hudson River that stretched overnight
trips by oil tankers into a day and a half. The Assembly and Senate will hold
hearings as early as next week to investigate suspicions of price gouging.
</P>
<P>
	   But the owners of the 3 million households in New York that heat with oil
might better not warm themselves with the strongly worded calls for immediate
action from Albany and Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Buhrmaster, the third generation to run Buhrmaster Energy Group in the
Schenectady suburb of Scotia, sees a longer term fundamental problem.
</P>
<P>
	   He blamed so-called "interruptables." They are major businesses, hospitals
and schools that switched to natural gas heat in the last few years, but which
must switch to oil when enough gas cannot be provided to customers - usually in
winter. He also blames the state's utilities that decide when to make the switch
because their gas systems haven't been expanded enough to handle their new
customers, and the state officials who have failed in recent years to force
improvements.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's why we're in the mess we're in," said Buhrmaster, chairman of the
Empire State Petroleum Association.
</P>
<P>
	   The frigid weather late last week prompted the Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. to
have the interruptables switch from natural gas to oil, said Nick Lyman,
spokesman for the utility.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a balancing act," Lyman said. "How much investment do you put into an
infrastructure you won't have to use most of the time? The question is how much
over-building do you do for an extreme situation that hasn't happened for two or
three years?"
</P>
<P>
	   Lyman agreed, however, that this winter is more of a typical winter than the
last two or three mild winters. He said all of these major customers are using
natural gas again and he doesn't know if the switch triggered the price
increases.
</P>
<P>
	   Assemblyman Paul Tonko, D-Amsterdam, agreed there is a fundamental problem
that will persist beyond this price spike. He said the state's energy policy
that lacks oversight and controls, and residents pay the price.
</P>
<P>
	   Tonko, for years the Assembly Energy Committee chairman, will be named
Monday to head the Assembly committee investigating the price increase. He said
it is hard to estimate how much the interruptables issue contributed to the
rise, but it points to a flaw in the state's energy system.
</P>
<P>
	   In Vermont, where there is no natural gas system, a shortage of home heating
oil that drove New York prices up 71.5 percent drove up prices there about 44
percent, according to Gov. Howard Dean. Dean also wants the national reserves
released.
</P>
<P>
	   Buhrmaster said the price spike will probably be felt most in just one
monthly bill, with market pressures likely dropping prices again in a week or
so.
</P>
<P>
	   "New Yorkers, especially the poor and the elderly shouldn't have to worry
that they can't afford heating fuel," Bruno said.

<HEADLINE> Appraiser describes, defends methodology for valuing land  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - The $335 million pricetag an expert land appraiser
has placed on the Cayuga Indian Nation's lost ancestral lands was derived
methodically, a federal court jury was told.
<P>
	   Arvel M. Hale spent Tuesday explaining and defending his appraisal approach
to jurors against a steady stream of questions and objections from the state's
attorney as the damages trial concluded its second day.
</P>
<P>
	   The nine-member jury must decide how much money the Cayugas should receive
for 64,015 acres of their former territory in Seneca and Cayuga counties.
Presiding Judge Neal McCurn previously ruled that the land was illegally
acquired by New York state in 1795 and 1807 because the state did not obtain the
federal government's required approval for the transactions.
</P>
<P>
	   The state has said the land is worth no more than $46 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to questions Tuesday from Justice Department lawyer Hank
Meshorer, Hale described in detail how he used county real estate records on
land use and data on selected sales to come up with his figure of $264.7 million
for the present-day fair market value of the land.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, during his first day on the witness stand, Hale testified that 69
percent of the claim area was in agricultural use while another 17 percent was
residential. Eight percent of the land was vacant while the remainder was either
wild forest or parks or used for commercial, recreational, community service,
industrial or public service purposes, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   To reach his conclusion, Hale said he considered 5,647 tracts in the claim
area. Assistant Attorney General David Roberts made sure jurors knew that Hale
only briefly toured the area and did not inspect the tracts individually.
</P>
<P>
	   Hale acknowledged that he didn't actually appraise any of the properties
himself. Instead, he obtained records on 14,407 property sales, a number he
pared down to 153 by eliminating all sales that occurred before 1996 and all
sales that involved improved tracts.
</P>
<P>
	   In a prior ruling, McCurn said the land must be valued as unimproved
property.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts again tried to undermine Hale's approach by questioning how
extensively he reviewed each record.
</P>
<P>
	   "You didn't personally review each individual sale? You hit a button on your
computer and ran a program?" Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I did not physically look at each record ... I wrote the program for the
computer. I developed the rules," Hale said in defense of his method.
</P>
<P>
	   As Hale went over his appraisal method, he used a computer and video screen
to help jurors understand his approach. Roberts challenged several of the charts
as they were introduced into evidence.
</P>
<P>
	   Hale also testified that he used a three-pronged analysis to derive at an
additional rental value of $70.4 million for the use and occupancy of the land
over 204 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Because only spotty records existed between 1795-1899, Hale said he
established a rental value for that period by considering all the land
agricultural and then using deeds and sales records to determine what the
average fair market price was for an acre for each year during that span.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bank, internet firm agree to curbs on releasing personal data  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The Harvard Law Journal argued for greater diligence
against businesses that violate privacy. That was in 1890.
<P>
	   In the age of the Internet - when data from bank balances and cellular phone
calls are a few keystrokes and a few dollars away - State Attorney General Eliot
Spitzer said protections against invasive firms must evolve too.
</P>
<P>
	   He seeks to require purveyors of personal information to get a consumer's
permission before it can be released. Currently, a consumer must take action to
be precluded from these lucrative lists
</P>
<P>
	   Two state settlements announced Tuesday will form a basis for some of this
reform under proposed laws.
</P>
<P>
	   In one, Chase Manhattan Bank has agreed to stop providing credit line and
balance information for as many as 22 million credit card holders, the attorney
general said.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank was providing information despite a privacy policy given to
customers. The information that included "encrypted account numbers" and loan
numbers was provided to marketing firms. Customers could then be called by the
marketers pitching emergency road service plans, discount shopping clubs, legal
services, travel clubs, garden supplies and magazine subscriptions, according to
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Chase would get a commission on sales, said bank spokesman Jim Finn. Finn
and Spitzer said they didn't know how much Chase made in commissions.
</P>
<P>
	   Chase will pay $101,500 for the cost of the state investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank emphasized that there was nothing illegal about its past policy.
Chase voluntarily imposed a moratorium on the marketing practice in July, Finn
said. The bank denies violating any consumer protection laws.
</P>
<P>
	   He also noted that the policy provided to customers reserved the right to
refer client information to firms if the bank felt its customers would be
interested in the products.
</P>
<P>
	   InfoBeat also had a privacy policy for its customers who signed on to the
computer e-mail service. It stated that InfoBeat wouldn't provide e-mail
addresses of its 2 million customers directly to its advertisers. But a computer
"software glitch" transmitted e-mail addresses directly to its advertisers,
according to Spitzer. A Spitzer aide said the company's marketing department
wrote the policy, but its computer programmers apparently didn't know about it
and allowed the information to pass unrestricted.
</P>
<P>
	   InfoBeat's policy stated it "will never release, sell or give a subscriber's
name or e-mail address to any other party or organization, without the
subscriber's explicit permission."
</P>
<P>
	   InfoBeat will pay $75,000 to cover the state investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   In both cases, the state's attorneys argued that the company's own written
policies were violated. Spitzer admits that if there was no policy, the cases
would have been harder to pursue.
</P>
<P>
	   That points to the need for legislation to protect information consumers
submit to companies and the record of Internet use on "browsers" that provide a
way to navigate the system, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is no longer just Big Brother we need to worry about, it's Big Browser,"
Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that for $100 a wife beater could locate his wife's phone number,
even if unlisted or cellular, and who she called. A prospective employer could
also hire a service for a small fee to find out what books a job applicant had
purchased online.
</P>
<P>
	   "Do we want to live in this kind of society?" Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer applauded Chase and InfoBeat for agreeing to what the state hopes is
a new standard. But it's just a start.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, Chase can continue to provide the name, address and telephone
numbers of customers to other firms. It can also share the additional
information - regarding credit and spending - to its own financial affiliates,
according to the agreement.

<HEADLINE> McCall: State board poorly monitoring contribution reports  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Financial disclosure reports filed at each of the
state's 58 election boards should be reviewed by the state Board of Elections,
according to state Comptroller H. Carl McCall.
<P>
	   An audit released by McCall Tuesday listed 34 potential violations of
corporate campaign contribution limits filed with boards of elections in Albany,
Erie, Rockland, Suffolk, Tompkins and Westchester counties and in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   "The laws are weak and weakly enforced and corporations can exceed the
$5,000 legal contribution limit by spreading contributions around to several
candidates in one county," McCall said. "There is no one adding up all these
contributions and instead of a system that routinely reviews all financial
filings and enforces the law, we have what amounts to an honor system in New
York."
</P>
<P>
	   The state Board of Elections is responsible for determining if state
contribution limits have been violated. The board is also required to report
violators to local district attorneys.
</P>
<P>
	   But officials from the board said they do not have the personnel to visit
the 58 local boards and review thousands of campaign filing documents. McCall
agreed that not having enough personnel is a problem for the board.
</P>
<P>
	   "Something we've discussed, however, is an electronic filing system for the
counties," said Lee Daghlian, a spokesman for the state Board of Elections.
"We've got an electronic system in place where state candidates file their
financial statements with the board, it would only be a logical extension for us
to extend this to local and county government as well."
</P>
<P>
	   McCall said he favors the extension of such a system and has urged the
commissioners of state elections boards to seek legislation requiring state and
local candidates to file electronically.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall's auditors reviewed records from 11 county boards of election and
found 58 corporations that appeared to have contributed more than the $5,000
limit to campaign committees.
</P>
<P>
	   In June, 1999, the auditors provided information on potential violations to
board officials for review and investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   As of Dec. 3, 1999, state Board officials reported they had conducted
follow-up inquiries and determined 24 had not violated the law. The board is
continuing to review the 34 remaining entities.
</P>
<P>
	   "In 1998, I was elected to my second term as state Comptroller and I'm here
to tell you that I hope I never have to run for office under the same campaign
finance rules again," McCall said. "Years ago when I started out in public life,
campaigns were about issues, today they are about one thing, and only one thing
- money."
</P>
<P>
	   An advisory committee has been formed to counsel McCall about a possible run
for governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   The comptroller has already hired a veteran Democratic fund-raiser to begin
putting together his campaign war chest, something that appears badly in need of
help.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, Gov. George Pataki reported to the state Board of
Elections that his campaign committee had $2.3 million in the bank. McCall
reported that his campaign committee had less than $73,000.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall spoke Tuesday at Albany's First Lutheran Church in an appearance
sponsored by the state Community of Churches.

<HEADLINE> Appraiser describes, defends methodology for valuing land  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - The $335 million pricetag an expert land appraiser
has placed on the Cayuga Indian Nation's lost ancestral lands was derived
methodically, a federal court jury was told.
<P>
	   Arvel M. Hale spent Tuesday explaining and defending his appraisal approach
to jurors against a steady stream of questions and objections from the state's
attorney as the damages trial concluded its second day.
</P>
<P>
	   The nine-member jury must decide how much money the Cayugas should receive
for 64,015 acres of their former territory in Seneca and Cayuga counties.
Presiding Judge Neal McCurn previously ruled that the land was illegally
acquired by New York state in 1795 and 1807 because the state did not obtain the
federal government's required approval for the transactions.
</P>
<P>
	   The state has said the land is worth no more than $46 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to questions Tuesday from Justice Department lawyer Hank
Meshorer, Hale described in detail how he used county real estate records on
land use and data on selected sales to come up with his figure of $264.7 million
for the present-day fair market value of the land.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, during his first day on the witness stand, Hale testified that 69
percent of the claim area was in agricultural use while another 17 percent was
residential. Eight percent of the land was vacant while the remainder was either
wild forest or parks or used for commercial, recreational, community service,
industrial or public service purposes, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   To reach his conclusion, Hale said he considered 5,647 tracts in the claim
area. Assistant Attorney General David Roberts made sure jurors knew that Hale
only briefly toured the area and did not inspect the tracts individually.
</P>
<P>
	   Hale acknowledged that he didn't actually appraise any of the properties
himself. Instead, he obtained records on 14,407 property sales, a number he
pared down to 153 by eliminating all sales that occurred before 1996 and all
sales that involved improved tracts.
</P>
<P>
	   In a prior ruling, McCurn said the land must be valued as unimproved
property.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts again tried to undermine Hale's approach by questioning how
extensively he reviewed each record.
</P>
<P>
	   "You didn't personally review each individual sale? You hit a button on your
computer and ran a program?" Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I did not physically look at each record ... I wrote the program for the
computer. I developed the rules," Hale said in defense of his method.
</P>
<P>
	   As Hale went over his appraisal method, he used a computer and video screen
to help jurors understand his approach. Roberts challenged several of the charts
as they were introduced into evidence.
</P>
<P>
	   Hale also testified that he used a three-pronged analysis to derive at an
additional rental value of $70.4 million for the use and occupancy of the land
over 204 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Because only spotty records existed between 1795-1899, Hale said he
established a rental value for that period by considering all the land
agricultural and then using deeds and sales records to determine what the
average fair market price was for an acre for each year during that span.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he set the rental value at 6 percent of the fair market value after
researching what a fair rate of return was during those years based on the
interest rates on government treasury bonds and on the interest rate New York
assessed when it sold off the Cayuga land at public auction in 1796.
</P>
<P>
	   The state's appraiser set the rental value at 2 percent and Roberts raised
repeated questions about Hale's decision to use 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   For the period from 1900-1960, Hale told jurors he based the land's rental
value on commodity yields and prices because there were no reliable rental
records available. For the modern era, he was able to use actual rental data
obtained from U.S Department of Agriculture reports, Hale testified.

<HEADLINE> Pooches trip the light fantastic on electrified sidewalks of NY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Jane Colton has seen it all. As a flight attendant she
once helped evacuate passengers from a burning plane. A month later she was on a
flight to Canada that was hijacked.
<P>
	   So Ms. Colton was not totally surprised Monday when the sidewalk outside her
Manhattan apartment house delivered a sudden shock -literally a jolt of
electricity - as she was walking her deaf Dalmatians, Spotty and Dotty.
</P>
<P>
	   Spotty - the one that's 40 pounds overweight and "looks like a coffee
table," she says - stepped near a lamppost outside the front door and began
yelping and skittering.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Colton recognized the problem from a similar incident some years ago
when, she said, dogs in her neighborhood were "jumping around like popcorn."
</P>
<P>
	   A Con Edison emergency crew found frayed wires from two lampposts were
feeding current through the wet sidewalk - only about six volts, but enough to
deliver a shock to any canine not wearing boots.
</P>
<P>
	   "My neighbor's poodle, named Madagascar, was doing the Mexican hat dance,"
said Ms. Colton.
</P>
<P>
	   Con Ed spokesman Joe Petta confirmed that the crew had found electricity
leaking into the sidewalk from two lampposts in the area, including the one
outside Ms. Colton's building on East 92nd Street. One was repaired, the other
was turned off temporarily.
</P>
<P>
	   The street lights use normal 110-volt household current, but moisture in the
underground conduits can sometimes cause electricity leaks.
</P>
<P>
	   "People wearing rubber- or leather-soled shoes won't notice it, but animals
will," said Petta.
</P>
<P>
	   While such incidents are "rare," he said, "we always respond as we did in
this case. We send a crew out."
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Colton said she was satisfied with the utility's quick response, but it
didn't persuade Spotty.
</P>
<P>
	   "She won't leave the apartment for fear of being shocked again," she said.
"They don't forget.
</P>
<P>
	   "She used to love the snow but is now so fearful that she starts shaking
when she sees her coat. She has to be pulled out and runs back inside. Short of
tying a T-bone steak on my belt, I don't know what I'm going to do."

<HEADLINE> Casinos May Aid Child Support Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By SONYA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has enlisted an unusual ally in his
effort to squeeze child support payments out of deadbeat parents: the gambling
industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's budget for fiscal 2001 will contain a proposal under which
gambling outlets could seize the winnings of patrons who owe child support. The
White House estimates that this maneuver alone could bring in $348 million over
five years.
</P>
<P>
	   The gambling provision is one of several items in Clinton's budget seeking
to collect $2 billion in back child support in the next five years. The largest
amount, $1.2 billion, is expected to come through streamlining of rules
governing distribution of child support to ensure that more of the money goes
directly to families.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides collecting gambling purses, the remainder of the child support
payments were to be gathered through efforts from booting the cars of delinquent
parents to providing funds to help unemployed fathers who could support their
children if they had jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We view this as the next big step in welfare reform,'' said Bruce Reed,
Clinton's domestic policy adviser. ``We've put mothers to work, but they
shouldn't bear the whole burden. Fathers should go to work and support their
children as well.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton will highlight the fathers program in his State of the Union address
Thursday night, Reed said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's budget plan sets aside $125 million for one year to assist
40,000 low-income non-custodial parents -- primarily fathers -- in finding work,
meeting support payments and re-establishing relationships with their children.
The program builds on $350 million in fatherhood initiatives operating under
welfare-to-work efforts at the Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House was announcing the child support initiative today, as new
data was being released showing child support collections nearly doubled between
1992 and 1999, from $8 billion to $15.5 billion. About $1.3 billion of that
money was collected by withholding federal income tax refunds, the White House
said. The rest came from steps such as garnishing wages, seizing bank accounts
and capturing driver's or other licenses.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the gambling proposal, casinos or other gambling establishments would
check to see whether their big winners owe child support as they go through
procedures for withholding federal income taxes. They would seize the winnings
of those who do.
</P>
<P>
	   It would apply to winnings through casinos, dog racing, jai alai or keno,
Reed said. It would not apply to winnings from lotteries, which already are
covered under current law.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the simplified collection rules, states would be given incentives if
they allow custodial parents to keep all the child support paid for their
children if they leave welfare, or keep up to $100 a month if they are in the
process of leaving welfare for work.
</P>
<P>
	   Other methods Clinton is proposing for collecting child support include:
</P>
<P>
	   --Attaching a boot to the cars of parents who have failed to pay. A pilot
program in Virginia successfully collected an average of $5,000 from each
delinquent parent. The White House estimated this would allow states to collect
$183 million over five years.
</P>
<P>
	   --Denying passports to parents who owe at least $2,500 in child support.
This would tighten a current program under which passport applications or
renewals are rejected for parents who are $5,000 in arrears. The White House
estimated it would generate $36 million in additional child support payments.

<HEADLINE> Surplus Projections Draw Criticism  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New federal projections that the surplus could hit up to
$1.9 trillion over the next decade could boost lawmakers' hopes for
election-year tax cuts and spending increases.
</P>
<P>
	   The projection by the Congressional Budget Office virtually doubles the
agency's last estimate in July.
</P>
<P>
	   CBO Director Dan Crippen was set to formally present the figures today to
the Senate Budget Committee. In prepared testimony, he said the estimates were
based on ``the mid-range of possible outcomes'' for economic and budgetary
performance, and conceded actual surpluses ``could be considerably different
from those projections.''
</P>
<P>
	   At least for now, the impact of the new figures is chiefly political.
</P>
<P>
	   On the presidential campaign trail, the new numbers -- almost twice the $1
trillion CBO estimated in the summer -- are good news for leading GOP candidate
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   He has proposed a five-year, $483 billion tax cut that could be paid for by
the new numbers. Some, including Republican candidate Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
have said Bush's plan eats up too much of the projected surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans cited them to claim they lived up to their pledge last fall to
not use Social Security surpluses for other programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Though final figures for fiscal 2000 won't be known until after the year
ends on Sept. 30, CBO projected that there will be a $23 billion surplus this
year without using Social Security's own hefty surpluses. The projected $1.9
trillion surplus, for the decade ending 2010, also excludes Social Security
funds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Republicans are right. They did not spend any money that belongs to
Social Security,'' said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M.
</P>
<P>
	   But Democrats complained that the $1.9 trillion surplus projection was
bloated. They argued that it unrealistically assumes that a large portion of
federal spending will either be frozen at this year's levels, or cut.
</P>
<P>
	   Spratt and other Democrats support an $838 billion, 10-year surplus
projection CBO also issued that assumes spending will grow every year along with
inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Before we get swept away by these projections, we have to closely examine
the premises,'' said Rep. John Spratt of South Carolina, top Democrat on the
House Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of likely political gridlock over many tax and spending proposals
this year, many analysts expect most of the surplus for fiscal 2001 -- which
begins next Oct. 1 -- to go for debt reduction. CBO projected next year's
surplus at up to $69 billion, plus $166 billion in Social Security surpluses.
</P>
<P>
	   But Spratt conceded that the new figures will ``raise everyone's
expectations as to what's possible'' because of the sheer amount of cash.
</P>
<P>
	   With the soaring economy pouring billions in unforeseen revenue into federal
coffers, President Clinton said he will propose paying off the government's
entire $3.6 trillion federally held debt by 2013. That would be two years
earlier than he has previously aimed for, and puts him a step ahead of House
Republicans, who are working on a plan to pay off that portion of the debt by
2015.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I ask the Republican majority in Congress to put politics aside and join
me,'' he said at the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton provided no details about how he would eliminate the publicly held
debt, which is money the government owes investors who hold Treasury bonds,
bills and notes. The remaining $2 trillion of the $5.7 trillion national debt is
money held by the Social Security and other trust funds.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said his plan, to be included in the fiscal 2001 budget he releases
Feb. 7, will devote interest savings to Social Security, extending its solvency
beyond 2050. It will also seek to ensure Medicare's survival until at least
2025, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Taking a swipe at Republicans, the president said the national debt is $1.7
trillion less this year than was projected when he took office in 1993, despite
``repeated efforts to push us off the path of fiscal discipline with large and
irresponsible tax cuts.''
</P>
<P>
	   But GOP lawmakers scoffed at his plan, noting that he has already revealed
dozens of budget proposals that will cost tens of billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you're spiritual, it seems kind of miraculous'' that he can eliminate
the debt and boost spending, said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete
Domenici, R-N.M. ``If you're not, it sounds kind of magic.''
</P>
<P>
	   Including Social Security's surpluses, CBO projected that over the decade,
federal black ink would total as much as $4.23 trillion.

<HEADLINE> Religious Quarrel Sprouts in Ore.  </HEADLINE>
   By AMALIE YOUNG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Foes of roadside memorials for car-crash victims are
waging an ideological war with Christian believers by posting signs bearing
black crosses with a red slash through them -- and some with the Satanic mark,
''666.''
</P>
<P>
	   The anonymous placards are part of an escalating public debate in Oregon
over whether crosses and other memorials familiar in states across the country
should be allowed at crash sites.
</P>
<P>
	   Transportation workers recently began removing religious memorials after
people complained they aren't appropriate on public roads.
</P>
<P>
	   A state senator, Republican Marilyn Shannon, has launched a campaign to
declare the religious memorials legal, and the Legislature's Transportation
Committee is considering crafting a bill to legalize them.
</P>
<P>
	   But some who oppose the religious memorials apparently have launched their
own campaign. The activists left one of the black cross placards, with ''666''
painted in red, on Shannon's lawn.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You know what I think? I think they are in the minority, and this is a
temper tantrum,'' she said. ``I knew all along that this was about the atheists
not wanting to see crosses on a public right of way.''
</P>
<P>
	   The state is showing no favoritism: Transportation workers who take down the
religious memorials also remove the anonymous placards.
</P>
<P>
	   Debate over roadside memorials has come up elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   In Texas, the state allows memorials only at the scenes of alcohol-related
fatal accidents, though there are other shrines. Tennessee law prohibits placing
anything on a right-of-way. Mowing crews used to remove all shrines, but
displays that pose no safety hazard have been left alone.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington state, a couple fighting to preserve a roadside memorial to
their son are circulating a petition to win a ballot measure that would
authorize certain shrines.
</P>
<P>
	   Montana, meanwhile, has allowed crosses along highways for nearly 50 years.
The American Legion has an informal agreement with the state -- when someone
dies in a highway crash, local posts erect crosses.
</P>
<P>
	   But some states, including California and Florida, have prohibited homemade
crosses.
</P>
<P>
	   Religious issues similar to those in Oregon arose in Florida after the state
in 1997 approved a uniform highway marker. The original design incorporated the
Red Cross' plus-sign shape, but was replaced with a circular black-and-white
marker with the words ``Drive Safely'' after some complained the symbol was too
much like a Christian cross.
</P>
<P>
	   No one is sure who is posting the black cross placards in Oregon and it's
unclear why they include symbols like a swastika and ''666.'' However, in an
unsigned letter to the Statesman-Journal newspaper of Salem, someone wrote that
dozens of the signs were posted to protest the religious memorials on roadsides.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In order to sleep at night, we had to do our part in the battle,'' the
note said. ``We truly hope wisdom will prevail.''
</P>
<P>
	   Those who support religious memorials say their opponents' placards are
offensive.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's pretty sick that it could turn into something like this,'' said
Jeremy Haddock, who survived a traffic accident that killed his two best friends
nearly two years ago. ``I put up a cross not just because I'm Christian, but
because it is a universal symbol for what I feel.''
</P>
<P>
	   In some cases, angry motorists have taken matters into their own hands.
</P>
<P>
	   William Berry of Salem crossed four lanes of traffic on Highway 22 -- on
foot -- to uproot one of the placards earlier this week. He was especially upset
by symbols attached to the sign, including a swastika and a ``KKK.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It just infuriated me,'' said Berry, who burned the sign.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Dave Fidanque of the American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon
said that if the state decides to allow religious memorials, it will also have
to allow atheists' placards on Oregon roadsides.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Once you open the door, you open the door to all kinds of memorials,'' he
said. ``You might not be very happy with what happens down the road.''

<HEADLINE> History of N.H. Primary  </HEADLINE>
   By HOLLY RAMER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Until recently, Edith Atkins had no idea the
grandfather who raised her also was the father of the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
	   During the winter of 1913, Stephen Bullock hitched his buggy to his horse,
Jerry, and made the 65-mile trip from his Richmond farm to the state capital.
</P>
<P>
	   There, he proposed House Bill 430 to create the first New Hampshire
presidential primary. The Legislature passed the bill in May, and after some
tweaking of the law two years later, the first presidential primary was held in
March 1916.
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't until 1952, thanks to the efforts of House Speaker Richard Upton,
that voters cast ballots for candidates directly instead of choosing delegates.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, the primary has snowballed, becoming synonymous with media,
money and maneuvering to remain ahead of other states. Droves of reporters
follow candidates into diners and out of town halls, spending freely wherever
they go.
</P>
<P>
	   Bullock, who died in 1944, missed it all.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think he would be amazed,'' his 85-year-old granddaughter said in a
recent interview. ``I think he would be very proud of his accomplishments, but
I'm sure at the time he did it, he never dreamed of the outcome of all this.''
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Bill Gardner, who tracked down Atkins after he discovered
her grandfather's bill, says a simple goal guided both Bullock and Upton:
getting more people involved in democracy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The struggle was between those who wanted people to have more say and
those who wanted the party leaders to have control,'' he said. ``It had nothing
to do with being first, it had nothing to do with the state making money.''
</P>
<P>
	   That sentiment aside, the state has shown fierce determination to protect
its leadoff status.
</P>
<P>
	   Detractors point out New Hampshire is hardly representative of the rest of
the nation and complain that it plays too big a role in choosing presidents.
Other states have tried to steal the spotlight, but Gardner and the Legislature
have beat them back with a state law that requires the primary to be held seven
days before any other state.
</P>
<P>
	   An amendment last year gave Gardner the power to schedule the primary in
1999, had that been necessary. He then set off a furor with the date he finally
picked, Feb. 1, because Iowa already had scheduled its caucuses for the day
before. But Gardner stood his ground, and Iowa switched to Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   Surprise and persistence, two elements of this year's calendar flap, have
long been hallmarks of the New Hampshire primary. Voters have been known to
reward candidates who hang in there, and upsets are not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
	   The first modern primary in 1952 offered the first surprise: Tennessee Sen.
Estes Kefauver beat President Harry Truman, which eventually forced Truman out
of the race.
</P>
<P>
	   Sixteen years later, Minnesota Sen. Eugene McCarthy's campaign against the
Vietnam War earned him a surprisingly strong second-place finish in New
Hampshire, enough to persuade President Lyndon Johnson not to seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps the best example of persistence rewarded is Jimmy Carter, who came
to New Hampshire a peanut farmer and little-known former Georgia governor but
left a winner in 1976.
</P>
<P>
	   For 40 years, the state had an unblemished record of picking presidents.
Bill Clinton, defeated in the primary by former Massachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas,
was the first candidate to become president after losing in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   This year offers the possibility of a double upset: Vice President Al Gore
and Texas Gov. George W. Bush -- the national Democratic and Republican
front-runners -- face serious challenges from Bill Bradley and Sen. John McCain,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
	   Edith Atkins is still considering her choice. But she'll cast her vote this
year knowing that the history of the New Hampshire primary and her own family
history are forever linked.
</P>
<P>
	   Candidates would do well to heed the lesson she learned growing up on her
grandfather's farm:
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've always gone under the idea that you've got to know where you've been
before you know where you're going,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Competitors Appeal Tabloid Ruling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A group of newspaper publishers has appealed a federal
judge's decision that allowed a new competitor to continue distributing
newspapers at area train, subway and bus stops.
</P>
<P>
	   The publishers of The Philadelphia Inquirer, the Philadelphia Daily News,
The New York Times and USA Today contend that Metro enjoys an unfair advantage
because of an unconstitutional agreement with the Southeastern Pennsylvania
Transportation Authority.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeal was filed Tuesday as the tabloid published its second edition.
</P>
<P>
	   The other newspapers argue that Metro's contract with SEPTA is
unconstitutional because it allows a government agency to assert control over a
newspaper and allows the free paper to be distributed where other publications
cannot be sold.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Robert F. Kelly denied the newspapers a temporary
restraining order Monday, saying they failed to show that they would suffer
"immediate and irreparable harm" if the order was not granted.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspapers appealed Kelly's decision to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals and filed a motion seeking an injunction barring the distribution of
Metro pending the appeal.

<HEADLINE> Energy Secretary Mulls Fuel Prices  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- While concerned about oil prices, Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson says the government's emergency reserves should not be used to
influence the market, and he has no intention to make such oil available.
</P>
<P>
	   But Richardson in a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press, said
he is meeting with a number of oil ministers from leading producing nations in
the weeks ahead to discuss the high prices in hopes of persuading them to expand
production.
</P>
<P>
	   Seeing oil prices dip below $12 a barrel a year ago, the producers belonging
to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries last March agreed to reduce
production by 4.3 million barrels a day. The limits have stuck and current oil
prices are nudging toward $30 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said he plans to meet separately with the oil ministers of Saudi
Arabia, Mexico and Venezuela, and possibly other countries. The OPEC nations are
scheduled to meet in March to decide whether to continue production limits.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the White House put in motion plans to increase federal
assistance to help low-income families pay for their heating oil, which over the
past week has soared in price. The Northeast, especially New England, is
particularly affected because of the region's heavy reliance on oil for heating.
</P>
<P>
	   The additional funds ``will help keep more families safe and warm this
winter,'' President Clinton said, announcing that he was directing the
Department of Health and Human Services to make the money available ``just as
quickly as we possibly can.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the amount of additional money was still not certain. The move came
as a blizzard moved through the Northeast and a week before the critical
presidential primary in New Hampshire, where heating oil prices are of
considerable importance.
</P>
<P>
	   In his interview with The AP, Richardson touched on a number of topics,
including his future political aspirations, the changing electricity industry
and improved security at nuclear weapons research labs.
</P>
<P>
	   On oil prices, he said the administration was concerned, but that ``the
market should dictate prices'' and not ``any manipulative mechanisms.'' He said
he would not direct oil to be withdrawn from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in
an attempt to influence prices.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those (stocks) are used for emergencies,'' he insisted. The reserve, which
holds about 560 million barrels of oil, or enough to replace 62 days of imports,
was created to counter interruptions in oil supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   On other topics, Richardson said:
</P>
<P>
	   --After many years as a member of Congress, he now prefers an
``executive-type position.'' Richardson, who is Hispanic, has been mentioned as
a possible running mate for Al Gore, should Gore win the Democratic presidential
nomination. He also has shown an interest in running for governor in his home
state of New Mexico, and has not ruled out a senior position in a Gore
administration.
</P>
<P>
	   --Security at federal nuclear weapons laboratories has improved dramatically
over the past year since the firing of a scientist at the Los Alamos lab put the
spotlight on the potential for espionage.
</P>
<P>
	   --There is a possibility of summer power outages because of problems in the
power grids stemming from the electricity industry's shift from local monopolies
to competition. He urged Congress to pass an industry restructuring bill that
addresses reliability improvements.
</P>
<P>
	   --He's worried about the loss of scientists at federal research labs and
hopes a balance between security and academic freedom will ease a potential
``brain drain.''
</P>
<P>
	   When asked about his political aspirations, Richardson deflected questions
about a Gore-Richardson ticket. ``I don't want to limit the vice president's
flexibility. I just want to see him elected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Richardson, former congressman, former ambassador to the United Nations
and the highest ranking Hispanic in the Clinton administration, made clear he
has no intention of fading into obscurity after this year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm a political politician,'' said Richardson. ``I see myself running
again, either in New Mexico or whatever.''

<HEADLINE> Titans, Rams Remember Win, Defeat  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL NEWBERRY AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Roland Williams had a tinge of disbelief in his voice.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everything seems different," the St. Louis Rams tight end said Tuesday. "My
hotel room seems different. The sheets on my bed seem different. Even the water
tastes different."
</P>
<P>
	   So, this is what it's like to play in your first Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can't believe it," Titans receiver Chris Sanders said, video camera in
hand as hundreds of reporters milled about at that annual phenomenon known as
media day. "Look at me. I can't stop smiling."
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams aren't really playing in their first Super Bowl, but they might as
well be. Their only previous appearance came in 1980, when they were still in
Los Angeles and St. Louis belonged to the football Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans are neophytes, playing in their first Super Bowl as Tennessee's
team or their previous incarnation as the Houston Oilers.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've never seen this much media," Sanders said. "I'm taping everything."
</P>
<P>
	   But, with memories of the Atlanta Falcons still fresh on their minds, both
the Rams and Titans declared a moratorium on anything that might be construed as
controversial.
</P>
<P>
	   No dog collars. No insults. No guaranteed victories.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want to be careful in what we say and what we do," Tennessee receiver
Derrick Mason said. "We don't want to say anything about the Rams that might get
them motivated."
</P>
<P>
	   Not even an appearance by Mr. Dog Collar himself, Falcons cornerback Ray
Buchanan, could produce the slightest of trash talk at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
	   A year ago, Buchanan first guaranteed a victory over the Denver Broncos,
then arrived for interviews wearing silver-studded neckwear as a way of
dramatizing his team's underdog role.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of being motivated, the Falcons suffered a major meltdown, losing
34-19.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not going to do stuff like that," Williams said. "We're going first
class to get the job done. We respect our fine opponent, the Tennessee Titans."
</P>
<P>
	   Not the kind of talk you'd get from Deion Sanders or Jim McMahon. Then
again, this game just doesn't have the star power of past Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
	   Many reporters kept glancing at the one-page rosters that were handed out at
the Georgia Dome, trying to figure out who they were talking to.
</P>
<P>
	   No. 77. Who's that?
</P>
<P>
	   Long before each team exhausted its one-hour session, the crowd in front of
most podiums went from thick to thin. Soon, reporters were interviewing each
other, pointing microphones toward players-turned-commentators like Joe
Theismann, Jim Kelly and Ron Jaworski.
</P>
<P>
	   "They don't know how to get wild down here," said Falcons offensive tackle
Bob Whitfield, taking a break from his day job to play pseudo-journalist. "As
soon as they remembered Ray in that dumb collar, they said, 'We're not going to
sell out like that."'
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, both teams seemed to learn from the Falcons' self-destruction.
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta's players were bickering when they got off the plane. Terance Mathis
decided it was the proper time to discuss a heretofore unknown alcohol problem.
Buchanan said Denver tight end Shannon Sharpe looked like a Kentucky Derby
entry. Worst of all, Eugene Robinson was arrested the night before the game on a
charge of soliciting sex from an undercover police officer.
</P>
<P>
	   Titans coach Jeff Fisher asked his players to please refrain from those type
of antics.
</P>
<P>
	   "He told us to enjoy the moment," cornerback Samari Rolle said, "but don't
get silly about it."
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan, who also wound up with a journalist's pass around his neck instead
of something studded, did his best to dress down the formal atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
	   "These guys look a little tense, a little intense," he said. "They need to
loosen up, have some fun."
</P>
<P>
	   So Buchanan waded into a group of reporters surrounding Titans safety Blaine
Bishop, armed with a microphone from the Black Entertainment Television network.
</P>
<P>
	   "You should be loose. There should be a smile on your face," Buchanan
advised, grinning mischievously.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm pretty loose," Bishop responded, managing a weak smile.
</P>
<P>
	   "Just don't guarantee a victory," Buchanan quipped.
</P>
<P>
	   "Oh, no," Bishop said. "I would never do that. Not with all the weapons they
have."
</P>
<P>
	   With those kind of answers, it was not surprising that yet another guest
journalist, Dallas Cowboys lineman Nate Newton, seemed bored by the whole
affair.
</P>
<P>
	   "This media stuff," he complained, "is not all it's cracked up to be."

<HEADLINE> Rams' Miller Is Getting His Wish  </HEADLINE>
    By R.B. FALLSTROM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Fred Miller is getting his wish.
</P>
<P>
	   When the playoffs began, the St. Louis Rams' offensive tackle expressed a
desire to meet the Tennessee Titans in the Super Bowl, and thus atone for a
nightmarish game. Consider it done.
</P>
<P>
	   Miller, the Rams' less celebrated tackle opposite Pro Bowler Orlando Pace,
can't wait to show the Titans he's not always a study of nervous tics as he was
in Game 7, St. Louis' first loss of the season. A combination of crowd noise at
Adelphia Coliseum and Titans rookie speed rusher Jevon Kearse influenced Miller
to commit six false start penalties, plus two holding calls, in a 24-21 loss.
</P>
<P>
	   Miller's plight became a bit comical. Every time a flag was thrown, fans
figured Miller was the culprit.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's one thing if you get beat by a defense," Miller said. "It's another
thing if you get beat mentally. It means a little more when you get a chance to
redeem yourself, and I'm looking forward to showing the style of ball I play
against an athlete the caliber of Jevon."
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams' coaching staff planted the seed for potential problems by
unsuccessfully attempting to fit their linemen with hearing aids in the days
before the game. Miller went into the game a bit hesitant, and then the fans
poured it on.
</P>
<P>
	   "Crowd noise was a real problem for us that day," coach Dick Vermeil said.
"We had a lot of linemen with their hands still on the ground when the ball was
snapped, and boy, you cannot afford to be late."
</P>
<P>
	   The coaching staff considers Miller's horrible performance a mere bump in
the road. He's been a solid, consistent performer, except for that game.
</P>
<P>
	   "He played well during that game, too, other than he was offsides a little
bit," offensive guard Adam Timmerman said. "When he got off the ball, he handled
Jevon just fine."
</P>
<P>
	   Vermeil indicated as much when he mercifully removed Miller, then reinserted
him in the lineup one series later.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have a lot of confidence in Fred Miller," Vermeil said. "He's a better
player than he was that day. He got a little frustrated that day. He learned a
lot, though, and he was in the game when we scored 21 straight points."
</P>
<P>
	   Timmerman thinks it would have been a much different story at the Trans
World Dome, where the Rams have won 11 in a row, and that it will be a different
tale Sunday at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
	   "On neutral turf, not dealing the crowd noise, I've got all the confidence
in the world in him," Timmerman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Miller appreciated the way his teammates rallied around him.
</P>
<P>
	   "It helps you mentally when the guys are still behind you no matter what you
do," Miller said. "We are going to stand together."
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans' response: The Rams can rally all they want. They've exposed a
chink in the NFL's top-rated offense.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's got to be in the back of his mind, because he had such a bad day,"
defensive tackle Jason Fisk said. "He's still going to have Jevon out there.
He's going to be nervous."

<HEADLINE> Military School Crucial to George  </HEADLINE>
    By TERESA M. WALKER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Eddie George has no doubt what would have happened to him
had his mother not sent him to military school after his sophomore year in high
school.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd probably be a manager at a fast food restaurant or something. Not that
that's a bad job, but that was just the reality of my situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two years at Fork Union Military Academy helped switch George from playing
football on the streets of Philadelphia into the 1995 Heisman Trophy winner from
Ohio State. Now he's the Tennessee Titans' star running back, basking in the
limelight of his first Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was very crucial for me to leave and go to Fork Union because really, I
was on a path headed to nowhere. So I had to really get focused and decide on
what I wanted to do with my life. I was young, but time was starting to run out
on me," George said.
</P>
<P>
	   Focus is no longer a problem for George.
</P>
<P>
	   Nicknamed the "Beast," George pushes himself throughout the offseason with
workouts that include running up hills and lifting weights. During training
camp, he can be found running for up to 30 minutes after practices end. He eases
up only slightly during the season, varying his routine with the occasional yoga
workout.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's all to be in this situation," George said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's definitely a dream come true. I can't even lie about that. This is
incredible with all the attention the team is now getting. The atmosphere is
exciting, and it feels good to be in this situation. I want to take full
advantage of it."
</P>
<P>
	   That's because George, who has a few commercials and even appeared on an
episode of "Nash Bridges," feels he hasn't gotten that much recognition playing
for a team more famous for its travels than its players.
</P>
<P>
	   He is one of only four NFL players to rush for at least 1,200 yards in each
of his first four seasons, joining Eric Dickerson, Barry Sanders and Earl
Campbell in that elite group. He did something Campbell never did for the former
Houston Oilers by rushing for at least 100 yards in consecutive playoff games.
</P>
<P>
	   George is a deceptive runner, someone who follows his blockers and suddenly
explodes into the secondary. And he hasn't missed a game since being being
drafted with the 14th overall pick in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's a big strong guy," Rams end Kevin Carter. "If you hit him high, he
might bounce off. He's the kind of guy if you hit him low, you might bounce off.
He brings a tremendous challenge for our defense. He runs through arm tackles."
</P>
<P>
	   What's the best way to stop George?
</P>
<P>
	   "Stop him before he gets started. That's the best way. Guy that big gets a
full head of steam, he's hard to stop," Carter said.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis' Marshall Faulk, the NFL Offensive Player of the Year, noticed
that the Titans are using George more out of the backfield. George caught a
career-high 47 passes for 458 yards after working the past three seasons to be a
better receiver.
</P>
<P>
	   George also has worked at being more of a leader. When he arrived in Houston
for his first training camp, he found a team trying to survive a lame-duck
season in the Astrodome before moving to Nashville. Offensive lineman Bruce
Matthews was just one of several veterans, and George didn't feel comfortable
speaking up as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
	   Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
	   If he sees someone who needs inspiration during warmups or during the first
half, he speaks his mind. Receiver Derrick Mason says George has been a great
motivator, keeping the Titans focused on playing the next game.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sometimes we laugh at him because he gets caught in his words. He gets
caught stuttering. He'll say some outlandish word nobody on the team ever heard
of, and we laugh. But he does a great job of pepping the team up and getting it
going," Mason said.
</P>
<P>
	   With the Titans finally on a national stage, George wants to grab his
opportunity to be recognized as a top running back with the likes of Denver's
Terrell Davis and Faulk.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't know if we'll ever be in this situation again," he said.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche 4, Sharks 3  </HEADLINE>
    By DENNIS GEORGATOS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Chris Drury scored the go-ahead goal with 13:57
remaining and then assisted on a power-play score as the Colorado Avalanche beat
the San Jose Sharks 4-3 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharks rookie goaltender Evgeni Nabokov, who had a 39-save shutout during a
scoreless tie in his first NHL start at Colorado on Jan. 19, didn't come close
to duplicating the effort in the rematch. He had 20 saves while facing 24 shots.
</P>
<P>
	   Colorado goaltender Patrick Roy, who registered his 47th career shutout in
his last game against the Sharks, had 25 saves to remain unbeaten in his last
nine starts (6-0-3). Two of the stops came in the final 45 seconds after the
Sharks pulled their goaltender in favor of an extra attacker.
</P>
<P>
	   Owen Nolan scored two goals, including a slapshot at the end of a breakaway
with 4:04 remaining to boost his season total to 32, a new franchise record. He
eclipsed Jeff Friesen's 31 during the 1997-98 season.
</P>
<P>
	   Drury snapped a tie with his 14th goal, driving the puck into net with a
slapshot from between the faceoff circles.
</P>
<P>
	   Just over three minutes later, Drury sent a pass across the crease and
streaking Milan Hejduk pulled up in front of the net to knock the puck past
Nabokov for what proved to be the game-winner. It was Colorado's first win in
the past four games.
</P>
<P>
	   Colorado took a 2-1 lead on a tremendous effort by Peter Forsberg. Taking a
lead pass at the red line from Joe Sakic, Forsberg sped down the ice ahead of
San Jose's defenders and circled behind the net, beating Nabokov with a
wraparound shot at 8:09 of the second.
</P>
<P>
	   But San Jose tied it at 2 on Nolan's 31st goal of the season. He sent a
forehand shot past Roy from the top of the right faceoff circle after Vincent
Damphousse banged the puck out from a scramble along the boards.
</P>
<P>
	   San Jose caught Roy away from the net but lost a chance to take the lead
late in the second period when Ron Sutter was called for goaltender
interference, negating Tony Granato's shot into an empty net.
</P>
<P>
	   The teams traded goals in the first period. San Jose opened the scoring
15:51 into the game when Stephane Matteau, off a centering pass from Jeff
Norton, hit backhand shot from the slot past Roy.
</P>
<P>
	   Less than two minutes later, the Avalanche evened the score as Alexei
Gusarov broke through for his second goal of the season, knocking the puck into
the net after getting a feed from Forsberg.

<HEADLINE> Rams' Little Paying Price for Crime  </HEADLINE>
    By EDDIE PELLS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- This could have been the best week of Leonard Little's life.
</P>
<P>
	   For reasons that have been well-documented, in the newspapers and in the
courtroom, it might end up being the most torturous.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams linebacker will play special teams Sunday in the Super Bowl. Even
if St. Louis wins, his second NFL season won't go down as a success.
</P>
<P>
	   That's the price he must pay for driving drunk 15 months ago and getting
into an accident that resulted in the death of Susan Gutweiler, 47. Little has
pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and has jail time and community
service to complete when the season is over.
</P>
<P>
	   It's a topic that came up numerous times during media day Tuesday, despite
Little's attempt to dodge reporters by surrounding himself among lesser-known
teammates, halfway up the stands in the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
	   It's a topic he prefers to avoid, but one he has no choice but to discuss
this week.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think about this every day," Little said. "And a Super Bowl ring won't
overcome all the stuff I've been through. It won't overcome all the things
another family has been through. I don't care what I go through the rest of my
life. I'm still going to think about this situation. A ring can't account for
that."
</P>
<P>
	   It was after a celebration of his 24th birthday that Little drove home from
a party and hit Gutweiler's car broadside as she was on the way to pick up her
son from a rock concert.
</P>
<P>
	   After his guilty plea, Little was sentenced to 90 overnights in the city
workhouse, along with four years' probation. He also was ordered to perform
1,000 hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
	   Little's attorney, Scott Rosenblum, said his client has completed one-third
of the jail time and a large chunk of the community service. Little says he'll
complete the sentence two or three months after the season is over.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's one good thing about my situation," he said. "In the past, I never
did any community service. This helps me to go talk to people, teach people not
to make the same mistakes I did."
</P>
<P>
	   Paying penance through the legal system has not absolved him completely in
the eyes of St. Louis fans.
</P>
<P>
	   His return after an eight-game NFL suspension brought a strange, sometimes
hostile, reaction.
</P>
<P>
	   Some thought he had no place playing football, at least not until his
sentence was complete. Mothers Against Drunk Driving held a rally and march
outside the Trans World Dome on the week of his scheduled return. An awkward
silence seemed to envelop the stadium whenever he made a play.
</P>
<P>
	   Could the same thing happen in the Super Bowl?
</P>
<P>
	   "It could," he said. "But my teammates know what kind of person I am. They
know everyone makes mistakes. Ask anybody on this team what kind of person I am,
and they won't give you any bad feedback."
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, many Rams say they never had a problem accepting Little back on the
team.
</P>
<P>
	   This is a league -- a world, really -- filled with second chances for people
much worse than the third-round draft pick out of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nobody out here is perfect," Rams linebacker Mike Jones said. "Everybody
out here falls short. The situation with him was worse than what a lot of people
go through. I think everyone deserves a second chance. Leonard is a great
person. If anyone, he should get it."
</P>
<P>
	   In a much more limited way, Titans starting cornerback Denard Walker has
experienced problems outside of football.
</P>
<P>
	   Walker is on probation for assaulting the mother of his son last summer. It
was an incident his agent described as a "minor altercation" with a "former
friend."
</P>
<P>
	   The troubles he has endured because of the incident, and the attention it
has garnered, has made the third-year veteran appreciate his spot in the Super
Bowl that much more. It has also given Walker an increased awareness of what
Little might be going through.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sometimes in life, we get caught up in things we have no business getting
into," Walker said. "The only thing that will save Leonard in that situation is
if he asks forgiveness from God, himself and his family. That's who he needs to
deal with. That's the only way his second chance can begin."

<HEADLINE> Belichick's Request Denied by Judge  </HEADLINE>
    By WAYNE PARRY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A federal judge told Bill Belichick what many New York
Jets fans have wanted to since he resigned as head coach after one day: You
created this mess, now deal with it.
</P>
<P>
	   In refusing to issue an order Tuesday freeing Belichick to negotiate with
other NFL teams, U.S. District Court Judge John W. Bissell said Belichick had no
one to blame but himself for the quandary the suddenly unemployed coach faces.
</P>
<P>
	   But both sides could be back in court as soon as Friday arguing over whether
the ban on Belichick coaching elsewhere in the league should be extended.
</P>
<P>
	   Belichick's lawyers claimed the NFL is preventing the defensive guru from
making a living the only way he knows, and Bissell acknowledged Belichick's
distress at not having a team to coach.
</P>
<P>
	   "But who does he have to blame for that?" Bissell asked. "He had a head
coaching position with the New York Jets, highly compensated, with the prestige,
the title, the exposure, the market and the team that certainly should have
provided to him adequate rewards.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was he who turned his back on that," Bissell said in denying Belichick's
request for a temporary restraining order that would have enabled him to seek
coaching opportunities with other NFL teams, notably the New England Patriots.
"In large measure, he put himself in this position."
</P>
<P>
	   Belichick, angry with NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue's ruling last week
that he cannot coach another team this year without the Jets' permission, sued
the league Monday. His lawyer, Jeffrey Kessler, said the league's coaches have
been ordered to "boycott" Belichick in violation of federal antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
	   Tagliabue's ruling applied only to the upcoming 2000 football season, and
did not address the other two years remaining on the contract Belichick signed
with former Jets owner Leon Hess, who died a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   That $1.4 million contract called for Belichick to assume the role of head
coach upon Parcells' retirement, which occurred Jan. 3. But Belichick stunned
the team by resigning the next day, citing the uncertainties posed by the
impending sale of the team, and potential problems from Parcells' continuing
association with the team in a front-office capacity.
</P>
<P>
	   Jets lawyer Glenn Kurtz said allowing Belichick to coach New England, a key
division rival, would seriously harm the Jets. Belichick served as the Jets'
defensive coordinator under Parcells, and was credited with greatly improving
the defense.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's got intimate knowledge of the health of the players, the team's free
agents, their goals," Kurtz said. "Having him negotiate with the Patriots is
problematic."
</P>
<P>
	   But Kessler said the real harm would come to Belichick if he misses out on
the Pats job, which would include the dual posts of head coach and general
manager.
</P>
<P>
	   "New England is particularly well-suited for him," Kessler told the judge.
"It's in a conference he knows, he coached there, he's familiar with the
players, and he has a relationship with the owner of the team. If this
opportunity is lost to Coach Belichick, there is no assurance he will ever be
given another opportunity to be a head coach in the NFL again."
</P>
<P>
	   Bissell quickly rejected this argument, suggesting that Kessler and
Belichick tune in Sunday to the Super Bowl, where former Philadelphia Eagles
coach Dick Vermeil, after a long absence from the sidelines, will lead the St.
Louis Rams in football's championship game.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge scheduled a conference call with lawyers for both sides Wednesday
to determine if another hearing should be held Friday to consider a preliminary
injunction enabling Belichick to seek another job in the league.
</P>
<P>
	   The practical difference between a temporary restraining order and a
preliminary injunction is that an injunction could last longer. But, more
significantly, if Bissell denied a preliminary injunction, Belichick's lawyers
would then be free to take the case to a federal appeals court. Bissell said an
early look at evidence in the case did not bode well for Belichick's antitrust
claims. He said Tagliabue's ruling prohibiting Belichick from coaching elsewhere
for the 2000 season was logical and well-reasoned, and said the league's
anti-tampering policy was "a legitimate program to ensure the sanctity of
contracts."

<HEADLINE> Notes and Quotes From Super Bowl  </HEADLINE>
    By BILL BARNARD AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Kurt Warner will be the first former quarterback from NFL
Europe to start in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner will join St. Louis Rams teammate and fellow NFL Europe grad Tom
Nutten in the starting lineup Sunday against the Tennessee Oilers. Remarkably,
seven other players on the Rams also played in Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   One Titans player, cornerback George McCullough, was an NFL Europe player.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a dream come true to be here," said Warner, who led NFL Europe in
passing yards and touchdown passes as a member of the Amsterdam Admirals in
1998. "When you are a little kid, you dream about holding up the trophy or
throwing the winning touchdown pass. I always believed I had the talent to get
here. Playing in Amsterdam gave me the chance to show the Rams that I could
play. I was able to open some eyes by going to Europe."
</P>
<P>
	   Warner was MVP of the NFL this season, leading the league in passing yardage
and joining Dan Marino as the only quarterback with more than 40 touchdown
passes in a season.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides Warner and Nutten, other Rams graduates of NFL Europe are backup
quarterback Paul Justin, guard Andy McCollum, running back Justin Watson,
linebacker Mike Jones, defensive end Jay Williams and safety-kick returner Ron
Carpenter.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	   RAIDERS MEMORIES: Rams defensive tackle D'Marco Farr grew up in the Bay
Area as an Oakland Raiders fan. His fondest memories are of the Silver and
Black's "Commitment to Excellence."
</P>
<P>
	   "Howie Long, Kenny King, Reggie Kinlaw," he said. "John Matuszak.
</P>
<P>
	   "Tooz had the biggest feet I ever saw. I thought he was a giant. Then I had
a kid tell me the same thing when I was leaving to come here. It kind of takes
you back."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked what his favorite Super Bowl moment was, he never hesitated:
</P>
<P>
	   "It was 1980, when the Raiders beat the Eagles. Yeah, the Eagles coached by
Dick Vermeil. He hates it when I tell him that."
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   DAD'S DAY: Tennessee safety Anthony Dorsett will become the first son of a
previous Super Bowl starter to also start in the NFL championship.
</P>
<P>
	   Dorsett's father, Hall of Fame running back Tony Dorsett, started in the
1978 and 1979 Super Bowls for the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dorsetts are the third father-son combination to reach the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   The others are quarterbacks Bob and Brian Griese, and defensive tackle Frank
Cornish and center Frank Cornish Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Griese was in three Super Bowls for Miami, and Brian was a backup for
Denver last year. Cornish was a defensive tackle for the Dolphins in 1972, and
his son played for Dallas in 1993-94.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   BROTHER VS. BROTHER: Bruce Matthews, who will play in his first Super Bowl
on Sunday after 17 years with the Oilers-Titans franchise, had a crazy childhood
with his brother, Clay, who played 19 years with Cleveland and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   "Clay and I would make up games to compete with each other," Bruce said
Tuesday. "The most obscure was a baseball game that we played with a 2-by-4.
We'd throw darts at each other. The object was to catch the dart in the 2-by-4.
When we had our first beanball, our parents retired the game."
</P>

</P>
<P>
	   E'S OF PREGAME: ABC's four-hour pregame telecast Sunday will focus on three
E's -- emotion, edge and entertainment -- that executive producer John Filipelli
said were lacking in previous years.
</P>
<P>
	   "Other networks did a fine job, but they seemed to lack an emotional
dimension ... they didn't resonate," Filipelli said Tuesday. "We are looking for
water cooler stuff for the next day."
</P>
<P>
	   Leading the "emotion" end of the 2-6 p.m. EST pregame show, with
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Berman as host, is a feature on the late Walter Payton, who died of
liver disease during this season.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's appropriate that No. 34 will be a centerpiece of the 34th Super Bowl,"
Filipelli said.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the "entertainment" spokes of the show will be magician David Blaine
performing tricks with Super Bowl players.
</P>
<P>
	   Blaine gave a preview at media day on Tuesday when he had St. Louis running
back Marshall Faulk shuffle a card deck and pick a card without revealing it to
Blaine.
</P>
<P>
	   The trickster then tossed the entire deck toward the back of the booth where
Faulk was sitting and asked him to retrieve a card stuck behind a logo. Faulk
then pulled out the card he originally picked from the deck.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   SUPER CARTOONS: In perhaps the ultimate example of how traditionally
non-sports media wiggle their way into the Super Bowl hype, Cartoon Network
representatives asked players Tuesday for their cartoon favorites and finagled
promo spots from them.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have to go with Bugs Bunny," Rams QB Kurt Warner said. "He's always been
a favorite of mine, and he's a Warner brother."

Grandmothers Eager for Visit With Elian
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The grandmothers of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez are ready
to head to Florida for a government-ordered session with the Cuban boy while
political maneuvering intensifies over legislation to make him a U.S. citizen.
The two women made an impassioned appeal to Congress on Tuesday not to pass such
a bill, saying Elian was a Cuban citizen and belonged with his father and them
in Cuba. "It's our right to see our grandson and take him back home," Mariela
Quintana, the child's paternal grandmother, said. They won't be able to do that
at Wednesday's session with Elian in Miami, however. The meeting was set as just
a visit.

Hormone Combination May Pose Risk
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Menopausal women using the common hormone supplements
estrogen and progestin run a 20 percent higher risk of breast cancer than those
who use just estrogen, researchers reported Wednesday. While the risk of breast
cancer is still low for women who take both hormones, the increased odds might
further complicate the decision menopausal women must make about their health.
Estrogen is often prescribed to ease hot flashes and other menopause symptoms.
It also has been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease and brittle bones.

	   BEIJING (AP) -- A strong earthquake jolted the Himalayan Mountains in Tibet
near the border of Bhutan early Wednesday, but there were no immediate reports
of casualties, China's official Xinhua News Agency reported. The earthquake with
a preliminary magnitude of 5 struck Cona county, 15 miles east of Bhutan, around
12:45 a.m., Xinhua said, citing government seismologists. The region is sparsely
populated and has poor communication links with Lhasa, Tibet's capital 150 miles

the east coast, closing airports and schools. At least four people were killed
in weather-related traffic accidents in the Carolinas, and a 5-year-old girl was

walking to school in heavy snow. The storm closed major eastern airports,
including New York's LaGuardia and Washington's Reagan National Airport, and
others had delays and cancellations.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- With only three weeks to go before a crucial deadline in
the peace talks, Israel and the Palestinians accused one another Tuesday of not
taking the process seriously. The sides had set Feb. 13 as a deadline for
creating the outline of an agreement on the thorniest issues between them,
including borders, Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlers and the fate of
Jerusalem. But Palestinian negotiator Ahmed Qureia said that after 21 meetings
on the final status talks, nothing had been achieved and it was unlikely the
sides would meet the deadline.

Online Health Spending To Soar
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A strong demand for prescription drugs will push spending
online for health care products and services to $9.8 billion in 2004, up from
just $200 million in 1999, a new study says. Even so, most consumers still find
buying in traditional stores more convenient, according to the report being
released Wednesday by the Internet research firm Jupiter Communications. In a
Jupiter survey of 1,667 shoppers last fall, nearly half said it is easier to
shop in a traditional drug store, where they can get personal attention, low
prices and convenience in returning goods.

"spirited contest" for New Hampshire votes as his chief GOP rival John McCain
declared himself more prepared to lead and Steve Forbes said he was the
"authentic conservative" in the race. Bush, who won Iowa's contest -- the first
voting of the campaign season -- with 41 percent of the vote called the outcome
a "good beginning" for his front-running campaign. Bush rejected the notion that
Forbes is a threat and said he would focus on beating McCain, who is leading
Bush in New Hampshire polls after skipping Iowa to concentrate on the Granite
State.

    By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   The mayhem so often associated with Dennis Rodman was evident in Dallas,
even after The Worm failed to reach a contract agreement with the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
	   Blame it on the Rodman stir swirling around the Mavs, or the bad blood
created by Dallas' dominance of Golden State this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever the case, the Mavericks and Warriors went after each other like
Rodzillaesque wrestlers Tuesday night in a 117-103 victory for Dallas.
</P>
<P>
	   There were three ejections, five technicals and two flagrant fouls -- both
against the Warriors.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm real happy with the way the team stuck up for one another when we got
into a confrontation," Dallas coach Don Nelson said. "That means we're coming
around a little bit."
</P>
<P>
	   Before the game, Mavericks owner-to-be Mark Cuban said he was optimistic
that Rodman could be signed next week. Rodman plans to spend the weekend in
Atlanta at the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mavericks placed power forward Gary Trent on the injured list, leaving
as void in the starting lineup for a power forward -- Rodman's position.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a very liberal owner who wants excitement and wants to win and
doesn't really care about off-the-court kinds of things," Nelson said. "I think
everybody is kind of ready for a bit of a gamble. If it works out, that'll be
fine."
</P>
<P>
	   In other games, Sacramento beat Charlotte 110-99, Minnesota downed Houston
92-84, San Antonio beat the Los Angeles Clippers 105-82, Indiana defeated
Phoenix 93-87, Cleveland topped Detroit 116-107 in overtime, Miami beat Boston
115-89 and Atlanta defeated Chicago 96-89.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Finley scored 30 points, 22 in the first half, to pace the
Mavericks, who completed their first season sweep of the Warriors (4-0) since
they went 5-0 against Golden State in 1986-87.
</P>
<P>
	   Dirk Nowitzki added 23 points and Cedric Ceballos had 18 in the Mavericks'
fifth victory in seven games, their most successful stretch of the season.
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas led 73-56 with 6:52 remaining in the third quarter when Shawn Bradley
shoved Mark Davis during a stoppage in play. Davis lifted the 7-foot-6 Bradley
into the air and attempted to slam him to the floor.
</P>
<P>
	   With 1:18 left in the quarter, Golden State's Vonteego Cummings was ejected,
the result of a flagrant foul against Dallas' Steve Nash. Nash was going in for
a solo layup when Cummings pushed Nash into the padded basket support. Finley
went after Cummings and players began pushing and shoving.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was just trying to make an aggressive play and not give up a layup,"
Cummings said. "I wasn't trying to hurt anyone. I was just trying to play hard."
</P>
<P>
	   Said Warriors coach Garry St. Jean: "I thought they were just hard
basketball plays. There's nothing more to it. This isn't a game for the meek."
</P>
<P>
	   Nick Anderson scored a season-high 29 points and Sacramento kicked off its
longest road trip in 13 years with a victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Webber had 30 points and Sacramento shot 53 percent in its first
victory in Charlotte in nearly 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kings, starting an eight-game Eastern swing, shot 9-of-17 from 3-point
range, including their first three in the fourth quarter. Anderson led the way
with a 3-for-3 showing from beyond the arc, helping Sacramento end the Hornets'
five-game home winning streak and four-game overall winning streak.
</P>
<P>
	   At Houston, Kevin Garnett scored 27 points, including two key baskets late,
as Minnesota held on to snap Houston's six-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
	   The Timberwolves built a 70-53 lead -- their biggest of the game -- in the
final minute of the third quarter, but the Rockets twice closed the gap to five,
the last at 85-80 with 1:48 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Garnett kept the Rockets from getting too close on a jumper with 1:58 to
play for a 85-78 lead and his basket with 35 seconds left to make it 90-82.
</P>
<P>
	   Terrell Brandon scored 26 points with eight assists.
</P>
<P>
	   At San Antonio, Tim Duncan scored 24 points and San Antonio opened the
fourth quarter with a 19-6 run to beat Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   David Robinson added 22 points for the Spurs. Both Duncan and Robinson
pulled down 13 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clippers, who lost for the ninth straight time, were led by Derek
Anderson's 22 points. Lamar Odom added 16.
</P>
<P>
	   At Indianapolis, the Pacers gained their 14th straight victory in Conseco
Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
	   Reggie Miller led Indiana with 21 points, including four free throws in the
final 24 seconds that helped Indiana hold off the Suns after they had reduced an
18-point deficit to one.
</P>
<P>
	   Clifford Robinson led the Suns with 24 points and Jason Kidd had 22.
</P>
<P>
	   At Cleveland, Bob Sura scored a career-high 31 points as Cleveland snapped a
five-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
	   Brevin Knight, who missed his first four field-goal attempts, scored 12
points in the fourth quarter and four more in overtime on 7-of-8 shooting as the
Cavs rallied after blowing a 19-point lead.
</P>
<P>
	   At Miami, the Heat ran off 16 consecutive points in the second period for a
25-point lead and coasted.
</P>
<P>
	   Voshon Lenard scored 21 points and Alonzo Mourning 20 for the Heat, who shot
55 percent, including 9-of-13 on 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   At Atlanta, Isaiah Rider scored 28 points and Dikembe Mutombo had 14 points
and 23 rebounds to give the Hawks their first two-game winning streak since Dec.

<P>
	   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee coach Jerry Green wants his team to build
on its big victory over No. 7 Auburn, not dwell on it.
</P>
<P>
	   Vincent Yarbrough scored 17 of his 24 points in the first half to lead No.
11 Tennessee to a 105-76 victory over Auburn on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were fortunate to play well tonight," Green said. "Auburn is a good
team. We have to handle this appropriately and look forward. We can't let this
be 'the' game, but rather 'a' game."
</P>
<P>
	   Yarbrough, who also had 10 rebounds, said the Vols took Green's message to
heart.
</P>
<P>
	   "We kind of have a tendency to take two steps forwards and one step back,"
he said. "Every time we come off a big win, we come back and lose or have a down
night."
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Auburn coach Cliff Ellis just wants a rest. The Tigers, playing
their fourth game in nine days, suffered their worst loss in four years.
</P>
<P>
	   "After four games in nine days, three on the road, you could see we were a
tired basketball team," Ellis said. "You could see Tennessee had its legs."
</P>
<P>
	   In other games involving ranked teams, it was No. 14 Indiana 85, Michigan
50; No. 17 Texas 82, Nebraska 55; No. 24 Temple 59, Xavier 40; and No. 25 St.
John's 61, Rutgers 57.
</P>
<P>
	   Auburn (16-3, 4-2), which lost in overtime to Mississippi on Saturday,
dropped back-to-back games for the first time since 1997-98, when the Tigers
fell to Mississippi in the last game of the season and to Florida in the first
round of the SEC tournament.
</P>
<P>
	   The Volunteers (17-2) hadn't played since a double overtime victory against
No. 10 Florida a week ago. They have the best record in the Southeastern
Conference and their first 5-1 SEC start since 1988-89.
</P>
<P>
	   A crowd of 19,405 chanted "Overrated! Overrated!" as the Vols pulled away
from the Tigers in the second half to avenge a 28-point defeat at Auburn last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought we came out ready to play," Green said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Volunteers used a pair of 9-0 runs in the first half to take a 49-32
halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vols shot 53 percent from the field, connecting on 36 of 67 attempts,
while the Tigers suffered through a 23-of-69 effort.
</P>
<P>
	   Yarbrough was 8-for-16 from the field, including two 3-pointers, for his 24
points.
</P>
<P>
	   "Vincent played well and scored in a variety of ways tonight," Green said.
"He hit the 3-pointer, shot inside and had a few tip-ins. It's hard to defend
him when he does that."
</P>
<P>
	   Isiah Victor added 19 points and Tony Harris, who left briefly with a
bruised knee late in the first half, finished with 18 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Auburn was led by Chris Porter with 25 points and Daymeon Fishback added 15.
</P>
<P>
	   Kirk Haston had 19 points and 11 rebounds, including eight points during a
25-2 first-half run that carried Indiana past visiting Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan (12-5, 3-3 Big Ten) came in as the best-shooting team in the
conference, but the Hoosiers (15-3, 5-2) applied constant pressure that held the
Wolverines to a season-low 25 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawrence Williams and Chris Mihm each scored 14 points and Texas held
visiting Nebraska to five points over the last 11 minutes of the first half.
</P>
<P>
	   Williams was 4-of-5 from 3-point range for Texas (13-5, 5-1 Big 12
Conference). Steffon Bradford led Nebraska (9-10, 2-4) with 13 points.
</P>
<P>
	   At Philadelphia, Mark Karcher scored 19 points as Temple held Xavier to its
fewest points in 18 years.
</P>
<P>
	   The Musketeers (11-7, 2-4 Atlantic 10), coming off a 31-point home loss to
La Salle, shot 24 percent in their lowest scoring game since a 30-28 loss on
Jan. 23, 1982 to Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
	   Pepe Sanchez, in his eighth game back from an ankle injury, had nine points,
eight assists, eight rebounds and three steals for Temple (13-4, 6-1), which won
its 17th straight home game.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, Erick Barkley scored 18 points, including the final five of the
game for St. John's, which snapped a two-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
	   Lavor Postell added 16 points and nine rebounds for the Red Storm (13-4, 5-1
Big East).
</P>
<P>
	   Dahntay Jones led Rutgers (11-7, 3-3) with 18 points and 10 rebounds.

<HEADLINE> NHL Roundup  </HEADLINE>
    By IRA PODELL AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- After three months and an extended road trip, the New
York Rangers are once again a winning team.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourth-line forward Mike Knuble scored the tying and winning goals in the
third period Tuesday night as the Rangers beat Pittsburgh 4-3, New York's
seventh straight victory and ninth in 10 games.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rangers, who swept a four-game in six-nights road swing, improved to
21-20-7-3 and vaulted over .500 for the first time since Oct. 17. The winning
streak is New York's longest since the 1993-94 season.
</P>
<P>
	   Knuble tied it at 8:48 with a sharp-angle shot. With only 4:23 left, he put
New York on top with his ninth goal.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's been a long trip," said Knuble, who played for the fifth straight game
after being scratched from the previous six. "We feel like we've been on the
road two or three weeks. Somebody else had to step it up and pick us up a
little."
</P>
<P>
	   The Rangers, whose trip also took them to Carolina, St. Louis and Atlanta,
were supposed to fly home following the game. But the large snowstorm in New
York, forced them to spend Tuesday night in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
	   In other NHL games, it was, Buffalo 2, Tampa Bay 1; Edmonton 5, Vancouver 4
in overtime; and Colorado 4, San Jose 3. The Phoenix at Carolina game was
postponed because of the same storm that hit New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Not only was the schedule unfavorable, but while away the Rangers lost
forward Kevin Stevens in St. Louis to a felony drug-possession charge and
subsequent treatment program.
</P>
<P>
	   "We looked a little tired and foggy in the warmups," said Mike Richter, who
stopped 20 Penguins shots. "It's been four in six nights and kind of an
emotional deal."
</P>
<P>
	   Pittsburgh jumped out to a 2-0 first-period lead when former Rangers player
Alexei Kovalev scored his 16th goal, on the power play, and Tyler Wright got his
fifth. Tim Taylor cut the deficit in half just 58 seconds later at 14:31 with
his ninth goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Hans Jonsson restored the Penguins' two-goal lead 4:51 into the second when
he scored his second goal while Pittsburgh was short-handed.
</P>
<P>
	   "Early in the game we made some bad decisions, but I guess that's to be
expected," New York coach John Muckler said. "What you like about the results is
even though we weren't as focused as we should be, we were able to fight through
it."
</P>
<P>
	   It was the Rangers fourth line, consisting of Knuble, Taylor and Eric
Lacroix, that helped New York win for only the second time in 22 games when
trailing after two periods.
</P>
<P>
	   Lacroix had two assists and Knuble and Taylor also had one each.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're kind of mumbling under our breath to each other about wanting to
provide some more offensive punch to the team," Knuble said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Penguins (19-24-4) are 1-6-1 in their last eight games and wouldn't make
the playoffs if they started now. They trail the Rangers by five points in the
Eastern Conference standings.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we're not desperate right now, all we have to do is pick up the paper
and look at the standings," Wright said. "Every time you lose a game in your
division, it's tough to make up those points."
</P>
<P>
	   The Penguins squandered a two-goal lead for the second time in three nights
and are 1-2-1 without NHL scoring leader Jaromir Jagr, who has an injured
stomach muscle and may not play until after the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
	   Valeri Kamensky's fifth goal made it 3-2.
</P>
<P>
	   Miroslav Satan and Michael Peca scored goals 2:37 apart in the second
period, leading Buffalo to a victory over Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin Biron made 21 saves for the Sabres, who snapped a three-game losing
streak as well as a three-game home losing skid.
</P>
<P>
	   Darcy Tucker scored for Tampa Bay, which has lost six straight games and is
1-16-2 since mid-December.
</P>
<P>
	   Ethan Moreau scored with a minute left in overtime, lifting Edmonton to a
victory in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Poti centered a pass to Moreau who fired a shot between Vancouver goalie
Garth Snow's legs as the Oilers claimed their first overtime victory in a
league-high 21 tries this season. The Oilers are 1-7-13 in overtime.
</P>
<P>
	   Edmonton's Pat Falloon forced OT by scoring with 80 seconds left in
regulation.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Drury scored the go-ahead goal with 13:57 remaining and then assisted
on a power-play score as visiting Colorado beat San Jose.
</P>
<P>
	   Patrick Roy, who registered his 47th career shutout in his last game against
the Sharks, had 25 saves to remain unbeaten in his last nine starts (6-0-3).

<HEADLINE> Mets Sign Ordonez to Four-Year Deal  </HEADLINE>
    By JOSH DUBOW AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Mets rode their infield defense all the way to
the NL championship series.
</P>
<P>
	   They locked up the slickest fielder in the group for the next four years,
signing shortstop Rey Ordonez to a $19 million contract Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "This gives Rey security and the organization stability in our infield
defense for the next several years," general manager Steve Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ordonez, who was scheduled for an arbitration hearing next month, won his
third consecutive Gold Glove last season and is the anchor of the Mets'
record-setting infield with second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo and third baseman
Robin Ventura.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mets made just 68 errors last season, 13 fewer than the previous low,
set by the 1998 Baltimore Orioles. New York's infield had 33 errors, 12 fewer
than the record set by the '64 Orioles.
</P>
<P>
	   "You build teams up the middle and certainly with Rey and Edgardo, we have
as strong a combination as arguably any in the game," Phillips said. "They have
been an important part of our success and one we feel is part of the formula for
success. Therefore we wanted to secure that for as long as we could."
</P>
<P>
	   Ordonez made just four errors last season, leading National League
shortstops with a .994 fielding percentage. He ended the season with 100
straight errorless games, breaking Cal Ripken's major league record for
shortstops.
</P>
<P>
	   Ordonez also had his best season at the plate, although he is still one of
the weaker offensive players in the league. He set career highs in batting
(.258), on-base percentage (.319), slugging percentage (.317), RBIs (60) and
doubles (24).
</P>
<P>
	   In four seasons with the Mets, the Cuban defector is hitting .246 with four
homers and 165 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
	   Ordonez, who was eligible for free agency after the 2001 season, got a $1
million signing bonus and will make $2 million this year, $3.75 million in 2001,
$6 million in 2002 and $6.25 million in 2003.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we hadn't gotten to a threshold we were comfortable with, we would have
waited to test the market," agent Adam Katz said. "We considered waiting, but
Steve and the Mets organization were forthcoming and very generous. We thought
the deal was equitable, so we agreed it was time to pull the trigger."
</P>
<P>
	   Ordonez, who made $1,675,000 million in 1999, asked for $3.5 million, while
the Mets offered $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   "I found out what free agency was when I left Cuba," said Ordonez, who
defected in 1993 during the Pan American Games in Buffalo, N.Y. "I can't ask for
too much. I came with nothing and now I have everything I've ever dreamed of."
</P>
<P>
	   Even with the new contract, Ordonez's future in New York could still depend
on Seattle's Alex Rodriguez, who is eligible for free agency after next season.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mets have expressed interest in Rodriguez in the past and could trade
Ordonez if Rodriguez became available.
</P>
<P>
	   "They've been talking about that ever since I've been on the team and it's
never happened," Ordonez said. "I just hoped I can stay in New York."

<HEADLINE> Yankees' Pettitte Signs for $25.5M  </HEADLINE>
    By JOSH DUBOW AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Andy Pettitte couldn't imagine pitching anywhere but New
York. His buddies think he's crazy for wanting to stay with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
	   Pettitte, booed by fans and questioned by owner George Steinbrenner last
season, avoided salary arbitration by signing a $25.5 million, three-year deal
with the Yankees on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "My friends have told me I'm a glutton for punishment," Pettitte said. "I
don't think it would be the same playing for anyone else. This is all I really
know."
</P>
<P>
	   Just a few months ago, it didn't appear that Pettitte had a choice about
returning to the Yankees. Steinbrenner, frustrated by Pettitte's inconsistency,
pushed to deal the left-hander to Philadelphia at the July 31 trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   Pettitte was 7-8 with a 5.65 ERA at the time, and his confidence was so
frayed, that he even tinkered with his release point during games -- leading to
a sidearm curveball in Chicago that frustrated manager Joe Torre.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought there was a 70-80 percent chance I was gone," Pettitte said.
"That was pretty devastating to me. Now they want me to stick around for three
more years. It shows how quickly things can change."
</P>
<P>
	   Torre and general manager Brian Cashman urged The Boss to give Pettitte
another chance. Steinbrenner did, but with a challenge to his pitcher to "show
what kind of man he is."
</P>
<P>
	   "Mr. Steinbrenner made some comments during the season," Pettitte said. "I
wasn't performing, so that's OK for him to do. He made me this offer. It makes
me think maybe he wants me to be around also to help this organization win."
</P>
<P>
	   Pettitte responded by going 5-1 with a 1.76 ERA in August and winning twice
in the postseason. The 27-year-old left-hander finished the year 14-11 with a
4.70 ERA in 31 starts.
</P>
<P>
	   He then beat Texas in the first round of the playoffs, allowing one run in 7
1-3 innings in Game 2, and defeated Boston in Game 4 of the AL Championship
Series, allowing two runs in 7 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
	   Pettitte stumbled against Atlanta in Game 3 of the World Series, getting
pounded for five runs and 10 hits in 3 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe in him. He's had his successes, he's had his failures," Cashman
said. "He battled through it and finished really strong. He's one of the major
reasons why over the last four years we have three rings. We're happy to come to
agreement with someone of his caliber."
</P>
<P>
	   Pettitte, who made $5.95 million last year, would have been eligible for
free agency after this season. He will get a $3 million signing bonus, $6
million each in 2000 and 2001, and $8.5 million in 2002. The Yankees hold an
$11.5 million option for 2003 with a $2 million buyout.
</P>
<P>
	   "Obviously, I could have made a lot more money if I became a free agent,"
Pettitte said. "I really don't think I needed to have a monster year. I'm
comfortable in New York and there's nowhere else I want to play."
</P>
<P>
	   Pettitte is 81-46 with a 3.92 ERA in five seasons with the Yankees. His 69
wins the past four seasons trail only Boston's Pedro Martinez (72) and Atlanta's
Greg Maddux (71) for most in the majors.
</P>
<P>
	   Four Yankees remain in arbitration, but shortstop Derek Jeter is near
agreement on a record $118.5 million, seven-year contract, a deal expected to be
concluded in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Steinbrenner met with Jeter on Monday, and talks between the Yankees and
agent Casey Close are expected to be held later this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Also in arbitration are closer Mariano Rivera and relievers Ramiro Mendoza
and Jason Grimsley. The Yankees settled last week with catcher Jorge Posada on a
$1.25 million, one-year contract.
</P>
<P>
	   The Yankees have already committed about $72 million for 16 players next
season and the opening-day payroll is expected to end up at about $95 million --
slightly more than last year's major league-leading $92 million.

<HEADLINE> Prada Takes America's Cup Race  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- You're driving along when, suddenly, you're
rear-ended by another car. You're lucky if you escape with a case of whiplash.
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Larson was in a more precarious position -- 100 feet up the mast of
AmericaOne assessing wind and sea conditions while the boat bobbed on the waves
-- when he sensed an impending collision.
</P>
<P>
	``I have to protect my assets when I'm hanging on up there and the boats are
going to jerk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	So the 5-foot-8, 164-pound strategist for the United States' entry in the
America's Cup challenger finals was ready when his boat was nudged from behind
by Prada of Italy during pre-start maneuvering Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	``I held on a little tighter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	Larson recovered, but so did Prada.
</P>
<P>
	The Italian boat scored a 24-second victory in the opening race of the
best-of-9 round to determine who would face defending champion New Zealand in
another best-of-9 series starting Feb. 19 for sailing's top prize.
</P>
<P>
	Prada had a chance to go up 2-0 today despite being penalized for the bump.
Skipper Francesco de Angelis had to do a 360-degree turn at a point of his
choice on the six-leg, 18 1/2-mile Hauraki Gulf course.
</P>
<P>
	He did that just before reaching the midpoint of the race, then held off a late
charge by AmericaOne skipper Paul Cayard on the last leg, a 3 1/4-mile run with
the wind at their backs.
</P>
<P>
	The race, delayed 24 hours by heavy winds and rough seas, began with a moderate
southerly wind of 14 knots that diminished later in the race.
</P>
<P>
	Both skippers knew the shifty winds on the Gulf called for unusual tactics.
Instead of trying to stay between the wind and the opponent, they often headed
for opposite sides of the course where both found helpful breezes at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
	``The wind is very shifty so, a lot of times, you have to sail your own race,''
de Angelis said.
</P>
<P>
	``You have to sail the wind you have,'' Cayard said. ``You can't do something
just because the other guy does it.''
</P>
<P>
	Cayard had two good opportunities Wednesday: Prada had to take chances to build
up a big enough lead to survive the penalty, and AmericaOne had to keep gaining
after it nearly caught Prada on the last leg.
</P>
<P>
	``We were getting some (wind) puffs and picking our moments'' on the final leg,
Cayard said, ``but we still made some mistakes there because I think the race
was winnable to us.''
</P>
<P>
	Prada's lead was 33 seconds after the second leg and 25 seconds after the third
leg once it had served its penalty. The margins after the next two legs were 34
and 28 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	Expect more of the same close racing.
</P>
<P>
	``It's just the first one,'' de Angelis said. ``We know that all the races will
be tough to the end.''
</P>
<P>
	``I think the shifts were bigger than the difference in (boat) speed'' in
determining the outcome, Cayard said.
</P>
<P>
	For 132 years, starting with the first America's Cup in 1851, the United States
won 25 consecutive competitions.
</P>
<P>
	But in 1983, Australia beat Dennis Conner's Liberty in Newport, R.I. Now Italy
is trying to become the fourth country to win the Cup in 18 years.
</P>
<P>
	Cayard is hoping to reverse another trend. He was the losing skipper in the
last two America's Cup finals, steering boats that lost nine of 10 races. He may
not get that far this time.
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in a lot of regattas and I've been behind before and I certainly
expected to lose some races in this round,'' Cayard said. ``It's an interesting
challenge because we get to come back and see if we can reverse it.''

<HEADLINE> Colts Rookie Won't Face Charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Indianapolis Colts rookie Steve Muhammad won't face
charges in connection with his wife's death.
</P>
<P>
	   Nichole Muhammad died Nov. 7 after injuries from a car accident forced her
into premature labor. The couple's baby was stillborn and Nichole Muhammad bled
to death following the delivery.
</P>
<P>
	   Marion County Prosecutor Scott Newman said Tuesday that his investigation
found that Nichole Muhammad's death was caused by a single-car accident. He said
she was alone when she drove her car into a pole on Nov. 4.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was a crash," Newman said. "There's no evidence to indicate Steve
Muhammad was involved."
</P>
<P>
	   The Colts rookie was arrested 10 days before the accident on three
misdemeanor domestic battery charges. His next trial date on those charges is
March 21.
</P>
<P>
	   An autopsy indicated the alleged battery wasn't a factor in the death.
Newman decided to continue investigating Muhammad anyway, saying there were
still questions that needed answers.
</P>
<P>
	   The defensive back has remained free on $30,000 bond and played for the AFC
East champions Colts through the team's playoff defeat against Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
	   Muhammad, primarily a backup special teams player, spent last season with
British Columbia of the CFL.

<HEADLINE> National Labs Improve Security  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Security at nuclear weapons labs has made ``monumental
strides'' in the past year, but computer protection is still not 100 percent,
the Energy Department's top security official says.
</P>
<P>
	   Eugene Habiger, who was hired as the department's ``security czar'' after
the uproar over alleged Chinese espionage at the research labs, said he is
''99.5 percent confident'' that America's nuclear secrets are protected from
cyber-espionage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But when it comes to computer stuff to say impossible is pretty tough,''
said Habiger at a news conference Tuesday, in which the department catalogued
improvements made in protecting the nation's nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've dramatically improved security,'' said Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson in a separate interview Tuesday. He said that the security and
counterespionage activities at the labs have improved so much that security
should not be an issue in Congress this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The firing of computer scientist Wen Ho Lee from the Los Alamos National
Laboratory for security violations last March and a congressional report on
alleged Chinese espionage unleashed months of criticism of the Energy
Department's security and counterintelligence operations.
</P>
<P>
	   It also prompted Congress to demand a reorganization of the Energy
Department putting all nuclear programs under a new semiautonomous agency, but
still within the department.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, Lee was arrested and charged with illegally transferring files
of nuclear weapons codes from a highly secure computer system to one that was
accessible to outside hackers, and copying the files onto computer tapes. The
violations occurred in 1993 and 1994 and seven of the tapes have not been
recovered, the government contends.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee has acknowledged making the transfers and the copies, but strongly
denies providing outsiders, including China, secret information. He is in jail
in Albuquerque awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said what Lee admits to doing couldn't happen with the security
improvements now in place. Habiger, a retired Air Force general, touted new
procedures including an ``air gap'' -- or physical separation of the secure and
unsecure computer systems -- and ``elaborate controls'' on any physical
transfers.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, a progress report submitted by Habiger acknowledges that while
it is increasingly difficult to remove data from a classified computer system,
it's not impossible.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the tasks left, said the report, is ``complete ongoing programs to
ensure physical incompatibility between classified and unclassified computer
systems as well as totally restricting any capability of removing data from a
classified system.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a series of security tests over the past summer and fall at the
three labs --Sandia and Los Alamos in New Mexico and Lawrence Livermore in
California -- showed ``dramatic'' improvements, said Richardson.
</P>
<P>
	   A year-end status report gave each of the labs ``satisfactory'' grades --
the highest possible -- in overall security in December. Lawrence Livermore
continued to be ``marginal'' in unclassified cyber-security in December, but
officials said they expected improvement in coming months.
</P>
<P>
	   Glenn Podonsky, whose office conducted the tests, said he could not
elaborate on Lawrence Livermore's shortcomings because such details are
classified.

<HEADLINE> Possible Head Found for Iraq Agency  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- With U.N. Security Council members divided over who
will head the new weapons inspection agency for Iraq, a possible consensus
candidate has emerged -- the former head of the U.N. nuclear agency, Hans Blix
of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
	   The French Foreign Ministry confirmed Tuesday that Blix was an unofficial
candidate and one ``with the profile we're looking for,'' said a deputy
spokesman for the ministry, Francois Rivasseau. ``I don't believe there is any
problem'' with Blix.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States has indicated its support for Blix, and several Western
diplomats said they believed he could have unanimous support in the council. The
issue could be raised as early as today in the council, one diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Security Council failed last week to agree on another Swede to head the
new agency, Rolf Ekeus, who was the executive chairman of the U.N. Special
Commission for Iraq from 1991 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Both the Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency --
which Blix headed until 1997 -- were charged with overseeing the destruction of
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction in the aftermath of the 1991 Persian Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
	   The Special Commission fell out of favor with council members Russia, China
and France after allegations surfaced that the United States was using it to spy
on Iraq and after a commission report triggered U.S. and British airstrikes in
December 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   IAEA inspectors, who focused solely on Iraq's nuclear program, worked
separately from the Special Commission and were never as controversial.
</P>
<P>
	   In a bid to restart weapons inspections, the Security Council in December
created a new body, called the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection
Commission, to replace the Special Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   After a month-long search, Secretary-General Kofi Annan nominated Ekeus to
head the new agency. But Russia, China and France rejected him last week, saying
his associations with the Special Commission made him unfit to lead the new
agency.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Washington Subdued by Heavy Snow  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal government workers were told to stay home again
today after a surprise winter storm blanketed the nation's capital with nearly a
foot of snow.
</P>
<P>
	   Except for military and emergency personnel, the 250,000 federal workers
were excused from work for the second day in a row, their first weather days-off
since a blizzard in January 1996, the Office of Personnel Management said.
</P>
<P>
	   By nightfall Tuesday the frozen white blanket coating the D.C. area had
risen to 8.5 inches at Washington Reagan National Airport, which had canceled
all flights during the day. Washington Dulles International Airport struggled to
keep one runway open.
</P>
<P>
	   Snow flurries were predicted for today.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's weather shutdown, the ninth since 1987, cost taxpayers some $60
million in lost work, said Jon-Christopher Bua, director of communications with
the personnel office.
</P>
<P>
	   Louis Uccelini, the National Weather Service's winter weather expert, said
that over the past 50 years there have been 28 such nor'easters that have dumped
heavy snow from Washington to Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress had only returned from its winter recess on Monday and had a light
schedule, but most of that was wiped out by the snow. Federal Reserve Chairman
Greenspan's testimony before the Senate Budget Committee was canceled.
</P>
<P>
	   Those who couldn't make it to the office were apparently making a lot of
phone calls. Bell Atlantic said so many customers were trying to make calls at
the same time that it caused some congestion on the network.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington Mayor Anthony Williams showed up for a noon news conference in
the front seat of a snow plow truck after spending most of the day riding with
public works crews.
</P>
<P>
	   Past Washington governments have been criticized for responding poorly to
snowstorms, but this time they had 200 plows and trucks clearing the streets,
compared with only 30 operating during the 1996 storm.

<HEADLINE> Hatch To Quit GOP Presidential Race  </HEADLINE>
   By MATT KELLEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- No longer a candidate for president, Orrin Hatch is
returning to a more familiar role: Senate Judiciary Committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   After finishing last in the Iowa caucuses, Hatch was expected today to
announce that he is ending his bid for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   He had planned a news conference Tuesday, but it was postponed because of
heavy snow that shut down Washington. An advisor, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said he was pulling out of the race.
</P>
<P>
	   Hatch, 65, had hoped his nearly quarter-century in the Senate would vault
him to the top of the crowded GOP field. But he got into the race far later than
his rivals -- last summer -- and few voters seemed interested in him.
</P>
<P>
	   Hatch got 1 percent of the vote in the Iowa Republican caucus Monday night,
finishing sixth in the six-man field, and has low single-digit support in most
public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All these other (GOP candidates) are making grandiose promises, but three
of them have never been elected to anything,'' Hatch said last week, referring
to fellow conservatives Steve Forbes, Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer. ``They have no
clue how to work with Congress.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes finished second in Iowa behind Texas Gov. George W. Bush, and Keyes
was third. Bauer, who claimed fourth place, continued his campaign Tuesday in
New Hampshire, site of the nation's first presidential primaries on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   A top GOP strategist in Hatch's home state of Utah said he doubted the
failed presidential bid would hurt Hatch in national Republican circles or with
Utah voters. Hatch is running for re-election this year to the Senate seat he
has held since 1977.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His stature in the party has always been based on his personal character
and his influence, and neither one of them are affected by this,'' said John
Maddox, a former top adviser to Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign. ``He's
still chairman.''

<HEADLINE> Tears Separate Titans, Rams Coaches  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM LITKE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- They are separated by a generation and descended from
opposite branches of the coaching tree, yet the most telling difference between
Dick Vermeil and Jeff Fisher is this: The Tennessee Titans have never seen their
coach cry.
</P>
<P>
	   "Never," cornerback Donald Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Not once," safety Perry Phenix said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Uh-unh," defensive tackle Rod Walker concurred, shaking his head from side
to side.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yeah, once," linebacker Donald Stallings said, laughing. "The day he
drafted me."
</P>
<P>
	   Vermeil's St. Louis Rams, on the other hand, see him cry all the time.
</P>
<P>
	   Their old-school coach cries when he cuts players, when they get hurt, when
he shuttles them to the inactive list, even when they get selected to the Pro
Bowl. Most days that the 63-year-old Vermeil faces reporters, the Rams have a
pool going on how many questions it will take before the tears start.
</P>
<P>
	   "You're just talking about a guy that's really passionate about people, his
players, and it's a shame that people make such a big deal out of it," St. Louis
linebacker Todd Collins said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We live in such a cynical world, that people take that maybe as a sign of
weakness. But I take it as a sign of strength. ... I think it depends on what
type of person you are, too, and your beliefs."
</P>
<P>
	   Ultimately, that's the one thing Vermeil and Fisher share that make the
differences seem irrelevant, especially this week. Both can look up and down
their respective sidelines just before the Super Bowl kicks off Sunday and seem
themselves reflected in the squads that brought them there.
</P>
<P>
	   Fisher did his handiwork over the course of five nomadic seasons, starting
when the Titans were still called the Oilers and based in Houston. He was an
injured cornerback on the 1985 Chicago Bears who got his start in the profession
when then-defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan let him sit in on the coaches'
meetings.
</P>
<P>
	   When Fisher got into the business full time, he had some decisions to make.
Like Ryan, the 41-year-old Fisher decided to turn over the offense to a
coordinator and succeed or fail based on how much havoc he could wreak with a
gambling, punishing defense.
</P>
<P>
	   But unlike his mentor, he was only a few years and a few games removed from
the players he was supposed to be leading. In terms of temperament, he chose to
be the anti-Buddy.
</P>
<P>
	   "Typically, I'm not a screamer or a yeller. I take the same approach I take
with my kids," Fisher said. "If I yelled at my kids all the time, they'll stop
listening. But if they see you only get upset once in a while, there's a message
there."
</P>
<P>
	   There is no way to overstate how important his level-headed approach to the
game served a franchise that didn't have a permanent home stadium, practice
facility or even offices until this season.
</P>
<P>
	   "We needed to worry about the things we could have control over and forget
everything else," general manager Floyd Reese said. "We did a pretty good job of
that, especially Jeff. It was a daily crusade: Get through this day and then
face the next."
</P>
<P>
	   Vermeil's tenure in St. Louis was more stable, though no less frustrating.
He considers an apprenticeship under Bill Walsh at Stanford in the mid-1960s as
the most formative experience in his career. And for a long time, people who
played for Vermeil wondered whether he was stuck in a time warp.
</P>
<P>
	   Vermeil was a micro-manager before people knew what the term meant. He was
driven and always wore his emotions out front. His intensity was legendary, at
least until he walked away from the Philadelphia Eagles' job in 1982 with the
first known case of coaching "burnout." And yet, when he came back 14 years
later with the Rams, Vermeil still drove his players mercilessly. He still ran
five-hour-plus practices. He still ran contact drills as late in the week as
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Vermeil hadn't changed, but the players had. They grumbled about being
overworked; worse, their play suggested the Rams were wearing out or quitting on
him. A meeting with team president John Shaw at the end of last season
crystallized the problem. He told Vermeil he was commanding a ship on the brink
of a mutiny.
</P>
<P>
	   The old coach didn't learn new tricks so much as retire some old notions. He
shortened practices and added days off. He let the players practice without pads
from the middle of the week on. For all his offensive knowledge, Vermeil had to
be convinced to hire a coordinator.
</P>
<P>
	   He was still a tough-love guy. He just wasn't as tough a practice guy. He
still called the shots, just not the plays. The Rams responded with one of the
biggest single-season turnarounds in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know I'm a lot more understanding. I've invested a lot more time thinking
about the leadership role than the quarterback's first step on his pivot and the
first read when they go into a double zone," Vermeil said. "I'm different that
way."

<HEADLINE> 2004 PGA Shift Said Business Choice  </HEADLINE>
    By STEVE BAILEY AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- The sudden move of the 2004 PGA Championship from
Valhalla Golf Club to a new links-style course in Wisconsin will have no effect
on the 2007 Ryder Cup awarded to Louisville, PGA of America officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The PGA said last week in a brief statement that the 2004 tournament had
been awarded to Whistling Straits in Kohler, Wis.
</P>
<P>
	   The statement made no mention of Valhalla, the site of this year's PGA
Championship, or that it had been awarded the 2004 tournament in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision also was news to city and county officials, who were notified
of the move by reporters seeking comment on the loss of an event expected to
pump between $40 and $60 million into the local economy.
</P>
<P>
	   PGA of America chief executive officer Jim Awtrey met with Louisville Mayor
Dave Armstrong and Jefferson County Judge-Executive on Tuesday before making his
first public comments since the announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd like to say to the community that I'm sincerely sorry about the way the
communication took place, and I wish it could have been done differently,"
Awtrey said. "I would reaffirm to you that this was not based on anything done
or not done by the city of Louisville or the state of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
	   "Mayor Armstrong probably said it best this morning when he said, 'Jim, you
shanked one,' " Awtrey said. "And yes, I think considering what we would have
liked to have done, that probably was an accurate statement."
</P>
<P>
	   Awtrey said Herbert V. Kohler Jr., chairman and president of the company
that owns Whistling Straits, had been in negotiations with the United States
Golf Association to hold a future U.S. Open championship at the eastern
Wisconsin site on the shores of Lake Michigan, possibly in 2005.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, Kohler chose the PGA because he was able to secure a championship a
year earlier and because the month of August would be the best time to hold a
tournament at Whistling Straits, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Awtrey said the transfer was a business decision and had no bearing on plans
to hold the 2007 Ryder Cup and other future championships in Louisville.
</P>
<P>
	   Valhalla, a 7,144-yard, par-72 Jack Nicklaus-designed course in eastern
Jefferson County, staged the 1996 PGA Championship only 10 years after it opened
for play.
</P>
<P>
	   The PGA is in the final stages of purchasing the course and has announced
its intention to include it in its rotation of future championships.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've heard it said that the difference between commitment and involvement
is described somewhat like a ham-and-egg breakfast," he said. "The chicken was
involved and the pig was committed.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're committed to Louisville, and I don't mind telling you I stand before
you feeling like that pig invited to breakfast."

<HEADLINE> Western Resorts Relieved After Snow  </HEADLINE>
   By CATHERINE TSAI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- A storm that swept into the central Rockies dumped a thick
blanket of fresh powder on the slopes of resorts desperate for consistent
snowfall.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's been snowing for about three or four days straight,'' said Kristin
Rust, a spokeswoman for Colorado Ski Country USA. ``It's just doing worlds of
good for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
	   From Utah to Colorado to New Mexico, ski operators delighted in snowy
weather this week that lured visitors back to the slopes after a slow start to
the season.
</P>
<P>
	   A winter storm that began in the Sierra on Sunday lingered into Tuesday,
dumping up to 7 feet of snow in parts of Nevada.
</P>
<P>
	   Ski resorts on the East Coast, which was walloped by a significant storm
Tuesday, also basked in fresh snow.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York's Catskill mountains, a ski resort which bills itself as the
``snowmaking capital of the world'' welcomed real snow.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People don't believe there's snow on the mountain if there isn't any in
their front yard,'' said Orville Slutzky, general manager of Hunter Mountain.
``The snow gets people psyched to go skiing.''
</P>
<P>
	   However, it was the West where the snow was badly needed. Just last week,
Colorado Ski Country USA reported a decline in skier visits to the nation's No.
1 ski state due to a lack of snow and Y2K-related worries.
</P>
<P>
	   The lack of snow forced Colorado's Arapahoe Basin to miss its target opening
date by a month, and Taos Ski Valley in New Mexico opened on Dec. 16 instead of
its usual start on Thanksgiving weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   But several Colorado resorts reported double-digit snowfall since the
weekend. At Loveland ski resort, plenty of office workers and students took
advantage of the snow on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a lot of people playing hooky today,'' said Scott Fortner, a
resort spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah ski resorts got nearly a foot of snow overnight Tuesday in the Wasatch
Range east of Salt Lake City. Park City Mountain Resort saw 10 inches of fresh
snow at 10,000 feet by midday Tuesday. Melissa O'Brien, a spokeswoman at the
resort, said there is still a lot of time left for the resorts to make up for
this season's slow start.
</P>
<P>
	   ``February is still a really strong month for snow cycles. We're definitely
not writing off the season by any means,'' she said. ``Last year we were getting
snow in June.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Grueling hours on the campaign trail can make a
candidate snappish, but not like this.
</P>
<P>
	   When a guide at an environmental center offered Gary Bauer a close look at a
snapping turtle Tuesday, the Republican presidential hopeful jumped back.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm willing to face Bush, but not this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The encounter came as Bauer and his family toured Amoskeag Fishways, where
glass walls let visitors glimpse Atlantic salmon migrating up the Merrimack
River in season.
</P>
<P>
	   The turtle, named Lucky, is the Fishway's mascot.

	   BY THE NUMBERS:

<P>
	   6 -- The low temperature Tuesday in Des Moines, Iowa, after presidential
candidates left.
</P>
<P>
	   19 -- The low temperature Tuesday in Manchester, N.H., after most of the
candidates arrived in the state.

<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   VOTER'S VOICE:
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not just a political dalliance for him. He really believes in what
he's talking about. Whether or not he's going to be president, he has raised
other candidates' and society's consciousness to the next level.'' -- David
Clark, a Bauer supporter, New Hampshire voter, and father of three sons.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   THIS DATE FOUR YEARS AGO:
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, hit with negative ads from rivals and
questions about his ability to compete with President Clinton, complained in
Waterloo, Iowa, that the GOP race seemed at times like ``running for the
mud-wrestling championship.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rival Sen. Phil Gramm said Dole did not do a good job responding to
Clinton's State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What is happening is that people who already question whether or not Bob
Dole can beat Bill Clinton now are increasingly convinced he can't,'' said
Gramm, of Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Dole defended his speech, which some criticized as too strident and
partisan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It played very well with Republicans,'' he said. ``That's who we're
addressing right now.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, he said Clinton did a good job.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's a good speaker -- a better speaker than me,'' Dole said.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   TUESDAY'S ROUNDUP:
</P>
<P>
	   The presidential campaign claimed its first victim of 2000 when Sen. Orrin
Hatch of Utah decided to drop his bid for the Republican nomination. Hatch, a
late entry in the race, won only 1 percent of the Iowa caucus vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore reveled in their Iowa
victories. Bush said GOP rival Steve Forbes ``deserves credit for a strong
second.'' He added: ``I, however, had a strong first.'' Gore went nautical,
saying his competition from Bill Bradley ``put wind in my sails and made it
easier for me to get my keel deeper in the water.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes called his strong finish a ``triumph of authentic conservative
principles.'' Sen. John McCain said he would support language in the GOP
platform to qualify a ban on abortion -- allowing it in cases of rape or incest
or to save the woman's life.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   TODAY'S TRAIL:
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans and Democrats hold back-to-back debates in Manchester tonight,
with Republicans on deck first. Earlier, Hatch is to hold a press conference in
Washington to announce he is withdrawing from the race. All the other candidates
plan to be running around New Hampshire. Forbes plans a foreign policy address
in Nashua.

<HEADLINE> Report: Thai Rebels Storm Hospital  </HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK McDOWELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thai commandos who stormed a hospital in a hostage
rescue mission killed some of the 10 captors after they surrendered, Thai media
said today, citing hostages.
</P>
<P>
	   Thai leaders and the public, however, have supported police and soldiers who
stormed the hospital Tuesday, killing all the insurgents holding hundreds of
patients and staff hostage in Ratchaburi, 60 miles west of Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
	   Police have said all of the captors were killed during the assault. They
were identified as members of God's Army and the Vigorous Burmese Student
Warriors, fringe rebel bands fighting the military regime in neighboring
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
	   Thai police stepped up security today at Myanmar's embassy in Bangkok and
along the border to prevent revenge attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nation newspaper cited hospital officials and relatives as saying that
four patients, one of them 78 years old, had died from natural causes during the
22-hour siege.	   The rest of the hostages were freed unharmed by the commando
raid. Five police officers were wounded.
</P>
<P>
	   The hospital was open today, but bomb crews searched for explosives in the
outpatient department -- where most of the hostages were held. Outpatient
services were moved to another building. Workers were still cleaning up blood
and broken glass.
</P>
<P>
	   Public reaction to the insurgents' deaths was summed up by Interior Minister
Sanan Kachornprasart in a statement across the front page of The Bangkok Post:
``They all deserved it since they've brought much trauma and suffering to the
Thai people.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Post also cited hostages who said some of their captors were shot after
surrendering. One hostage, identified as a senior hospital official, said she
saw police hold the rebels at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were shot in the head after they had been told to undress and kneel
down,'' the official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities displayed the bodies of the captors, wrapped in white sheets, to
the press Tuesday before burying them without ceremony.
</P>
<P>
	   Top police officials, asked Tuesday whether they had been summarily
executed, said they had died fighting. There was no immediate reaction to the
reports of witnesses saying otherwise.
</P>
<P>
	   The Khao Sod newspaper published photos of five of the men taken before they
were shrouded. The bloody corpses were stripped to their underwear. Government
spokesman Akapol Sorasuchart said an investigation would be made into how the
photos were obtained.
</P>
<P>
	   Many patients and their relatives said the captors deserved to die. The
normally reserved prime minister, Chuan Leekpai, said they had crossed a line by
seizing a hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nation reported that a pregnant woman, who had been brought to the
hospital for a Caesarean, went into labor during the siege. She was sneaked out
an unwatched back entrance to another hospital, where she gave birth to a girl.
</P>
<P>
	   Details of the rescue began to emerge. Plainclothes police began
infiltrating the hospital -- a sprawling, 6-acre compound of 10 buildings that
the insurgents could not fully control -- dressed as patients and medical staff
hours after the siege began. They identified the number and locations of the
captors and helped sneak what patients they could to safety.
</P>
<P>
	   The insurgents, who entered from Myanmar, seized the hospital Monday to
force Thailand to aid their beleaguered movement. Their camp was under attack by
Myanmar government forces, and Thai troops had shelled them to stop them from
seeking refuge in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
	   They demanded Thailand cease the shelling and grant refuge to civilians and
combatants. Talks were held into the early hours of Tuesday, when the assault
began.
</P>
<P>
	   The Post reported that three captors took part in the seizure in October of
Myanmar's embassy in Bangkok by the Vigorous Burmese Student Warriors.
</P>
<P>
	   They held 40 people hostage for 26 hours but freed them unharmed in exchange
for a helicopter to take them to the border, where they took refuge with God's
Army, a fundamentalist Christian group of ethnic Karens led by twin 12-year-old
boys believed to have mystical powers.
</P>
<P>
	   The embassy siege angered Myanmar's government, which closed the border for
two months and accused Thailand of coddling terrorists. Ties have improved
since, and the military regime praised Thailand for taking strong action this
time.

<HEADLINE> GOP Nomination Fight Shifts to N.H.  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- With the field narrowed by an Iowa defeat, the
Republican presidential candidates were meeting for their final debate before
New Hampshire voters weigh in the nation's first presidential primary next week.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, who limped away from Monday night's Iowa caucuses
with 1 percent of the vote, planned to drop out of the nominating contest today,
an aide said.
</P>
<P>
	   His decision would leave a five-man field with Gary Bauer, Texas Gov. George
W. Bush, millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, Alan Keyes and Sen. John McCain of
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer, meanwhile, was trying to dampen speculation about his political
future after finishing fourth in Iowa, with 9 percent of the vote, behind Bush,
Forbes and Keyes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was some speculation in the media last night that because I didn't
get second or third or whatever that I might be out of the race,'' Bauer said
Tuesday night in Exeter. ``So it's great to be at Exeter to be able to say I was
raised a fighter. So if anything, the results in Iowa will cause me to work
twice as hard here in New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, McCain told reporters: ``I am fully prepared to be president of
the United States -- more prepared than any other candidate.''
</P>
<P>
	   That dovetailed with a new television ad he began airing a day earlier,
which says he is the ``only candidate who knows the military and understands the
world.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, coming off a win in the Iowa caucuses, said Midwest voters had seen in
him what Texas voters had endorsed through two elections, as well as what a
majority of Republican senators and governors support through their
endorsements.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think if the people of New Hampshire listen to the facts and look at my
record and look at the confirmation from United States senators and governors,
they will know and they will be comforted by the fact that I can lead,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, bolstered by placing second in Iowa with 30 percent of the vote to
Bush's 41 percent, labeled himself the ``authentic conservative'' in the race
and said: ``The Republican establishment has met its match.''
</P>
<P>
	   But back in Washington, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
dismissed Forbes' Iowa showing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This was his high water mark. He'll go down, hopefully fast,'' Lott
predicted. ``What is he, publisher of a magazine? Great. ... Alan Keyes is more
qualified to be president than he is.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and McCain have argued about their rival tax plans, with the Texas
governor looking for a new line of attack nearly every day.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush pointed to new government projections Tuesday of a possible $1.9
trillion surplus over a decade, and said he would use half for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The difference between that and Senator McCain's plan is that 25 cents of
the proverbial dollar goes to tax cuts under my plan, and five cents under his
-- and therein lies one the debates of this campaign,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said Bush ``can't win'' with the tax debate because the details
confuse people.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you can't win on the big issues, then go into the details,'' McCain
said dismissively.
</P>
<P>
	   Abortion, a hot-button topic in Republican politics, helped Forbes win
conservative votes in Iowa with his flat anti-abortion stance.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush faced questions on the topic three days in a row last week, and at one
point said he supports the Republican anti-abortion platform -- although it
doesn't allow for exceptions he backs for cases of rape, incest or to save the
mother's life.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, asked Tuesday whether he would favor changing the abortion ban in
the GOP platform to allow for such exceptions, said, ``I would support the
change.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush reiterated that he was ``happy'' with the party platform as is.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is my position that the platform ought to remain the same,'' he said.
``It's a pro-life platform.''

<HEADLINE> Bauer Says He's Not a Quitter  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer says he's in
the race for the long haul, despite disappointing results in the Iowa caucuses.
``I am not a quitter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking by telephone between campaign stops in New Hampshire, the
Washington-based conservative activist tried to dampen speculation about his
political future.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm on the same message I've been on -- restoring protection to unborn
children, a China policy closer to Ronald Reagan's than the Clintonian policies
that even some of my opponents seem to support and I'm for a pro-family flat
tax,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
	   He plans to compete in a debate tonight with his other GOP rivals.
</P>
<P>
	   The former policy adviser for President Reagan placed fourth in Monday
night's caucuses, winning 9 percent of the vote. He finished behind Alan Keyes,
a former ambassador who, like Bauer, is competing for the support of social
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Another staunch conservative, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, finished last in the
field of six and planned to drop out of the race today.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer said New Hampshire has been kind to conservatives such as Pat
Buchanan, and could breathe new life into his campaign. ``The dynamics are
different here than they were in Iowa,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There will be a whole bunch of these contests and I plan to stay
focused,'' he said. ``I'll tell you this, I didn't go from Newport, Ky., to
Ronald Reagan's White House by being a quitter.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer has fared well in the presidential debates, particularly as he sparred
with front-runner George W. Bush. Polls show, however, that voters have been
more impressed with the dynamic Keyes during these sessions.

<HEADLINE> Calls for for Pinochet Trial Grow  </HEADLINE>
   By EDUARDO GALLARDO Associated Press writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- With the possibility that Gen. Augusto Pinochet will
be released from detention in Britain, escaping efforts to try him in Spain for
human rights abuses, demands are growing that the former Chilean dictator be
tried at home.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet was arrested 15 months ago in London on a warrant by a Spanish
judge who wants to extradite him on charges of human rights abuses during his
1973-90 rule.
</P>
<P>
	   On Jan. 11, Britain said a team of doctors determined that Pinochet was too
ill to stand trial. British Home Secretary Jack Straw was expected to announce
his final decision on Pinochet's fate after a formal hearing, expected next
week.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, however, human rights groups joined Belgium in launching a court
challenge to prevent Straw from releasing Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
	   Their challenges contend Straw must allow an independent examination of the
medical evidence he says leaves him inclined to block the 84-year-old general's
extradition to Spain.
</P>
<P>
	   Relatives of victims under Pinochet's dictatorship last Saturday started
daily peaceful demonstrations in front of the presidential palace in Santiago,
opposing the general's release and demanding that he be tried if he returns.
</P>
<P>
	   Both foes and followers agree Pinochet should no longer retain a political
role here, although he is a senator-for-life.
</P>
<P>
	   He created that post for himself in the constitution issued by his regime,
and he cannot legally resign. But legislators from all sectors are pushing a
bill that would allow him to step down -- keeping his congressional salary and
immunity, as well as a security detail for life.
</P>
<P>
	   In Chile, Pinochet faces 57 lawsuits filed by victims of repression or their
relatives, or by political, labor or social groups.
</P>
<P>
	   An official Chilean government report says 3,197 people died or disappeared
in Chile after Pinochet toppled elected Marxist President Salvador Allende in a
bloody coup.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge handling the suits, Juan Guzman, has been working for months, and
said he plans to question Pinochet if he returns.
</P>
<P>
	   Guzman said he will also have Pinochet examined by doctors. However, the
health problems that could gain the former dictator his release in Britain do
not apply in Chile, except in the cases of mental illness.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet, under house arrest in a rented mansion southwest of London, has
diabetes, wears a pacemaker and suffered two small strokes last fall.
</P>
<P>
	   No opposition has been voiced here to a trial of Pinochet -- not even from
his staunchest supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In Chile, nobody is above the law,'' said Joaquin Lavin, the right-wing
presidential candidate defeated on Jan. 16 by socialist Ricardo Lagos.
</P>
<P>
	   President-elect Lagos has repeatedly said that while it is not for him to
have Pinochet tried, he will make sure Guzman can act without pressure or
interference.
</P>
<P>
	   Hugo Gutierrez, a human rights lawyer representing several people suing
Pinochet, said he plans to seek the lifting of Pinochet's congressional immunity
``the day he sets foot in Chile.''
</P>
<P>
	   While most people in Chile are betting on Pinochet's early return, his
reception is being prepared amid secrecy. The army and the Pinochet Foundation,
a private group of Pinochet supporters, are believed to be in charge.
</P>
<P>
	   The government has sent a plane to London to bring Pinochet home if he is
released.
</P>
<P>
	   Followers of the 84-year-old retired general say they are preparing a
reception for him. ``It won't be anything official, but many of us will go to
express our appreciation and affection,'' said congresswoman Maria Angelica
Cristi.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Seeks New Hampshire Support  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- The abbreviated race for New Hampshire is shaping
up on the Democratic side as, in Bill Bradley's words, ``a whole new ballgame,''
with Vice President Al Gore seeking opportunities to hitch himself to President
Clinton economic coattails.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, who boomerangs between shunning Clinton and embracing him, has settled
on the latter in his attempt to win next week's New Hampshire primary and deny
Bradley any comeback from his sound defeat in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Before meeting Gore tonight for their last pre-primary New Hampshire debate,
Bradley was campaigning at a YMCA day care center to promote his agenda for
middle-class working families.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president was reaching today for a chunk of the credit for the 1996
welfare reform that congressional Republicans pushed and Clinton signed. The
theme of Gore's noontime appearance at the Electropac company here was timed,
aides said, to dovetail with expected news from the White House about Clinton's
proposed budget for new welfare-to-work investments.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's all-out drive for New Hampshire includes spending about $20,000 on a
half-hour TV ``infomercial'' to air here on Saturday, two days before the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Not only was Gore campaigning on the current record-breaking economic
expansion, but also on the premise that he could lead the country into deeper
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The question that must be answered in this election is not whether or not
we're better off than seven years ago. We know that we are,'' Gore said. ``The
question is can we do even better?''
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Gore was briefly suspending his commitment to campaign in New
Hampshire ``every minute of every hour of every day'' leading to next Tuesday's
ballot, to fly to Washington at be with Clinton in the House chamber for the
State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What the Clinton-Gore administration has done over the last seven years
economically helps Al Gore a lot, and I think President Clinton will be a very
valuable asset during the campaign,'' said Bob Shrum, a top Gore adviser.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's message could find particular resonance in New Hampshire, where
unemployment has plunged by 5 percent during the Clinton-Gore tenure and jobs
are created at a rate of 16,000 per year. The state was losing 10,000 a year in
1992 when Clinton and Gore first ran.
</P>
<P>
	   Eric Marion, one of the municipal workers Gore met Tuesday as he delivered
coffee and donuts to snow plow crews, suggested the ripeness of Gore's strategy
shift.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the ideas that are in office now have done us some good so far,''
Marion said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, looking for a quick way to sharpen differences with Gore, all but
conceded one precious day of campaigning Tuesday when the Northeast blizzard
shut down the school basketball game and restaurant he had planned to visit.
</P>
<P>
	   In his one appearance Tuesday, Bradley appealed to voter distaste with
negative politics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you are tired of misrepresentation in political campaigns to pursue a
personal agenda, if you are tired of what you have seen in the last decade in
this country, then you can send a message,'' he said at Alvirne High School in
Hudson.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley and his wife, Ernestine, later waited out the snowstorm at a Holiday
Inn, hanging around the lobby.
</P>
<P>
	   By contrast, Gore exhausted his entourage -- sleepless from a wee-hours
flight out of Iowa -- by skidding around Manchester looking for things to do.
</P>
<P>
	   What was to have been a one-rally day for Gore, who professed to be running
on just one hour's sleep, was suddenly crammed with impromptu stops at Dunkin'
Donuts, the plow garage, and an MTV rock concert, for which Gore changed into
tight blue jeans.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's handshake and hot coffee was enough to tip plow mechanic Henry Roux
Gore's way. ``To come out on a day like this, a bad New Hampshire day, I'm
impressed with that,'' Roux said.
</P>
<P>
	   Now that Gore has reclaimed his front-runner's edge in statewide polls,
voters like Joe Sullivan, a teacher and self-described liberal, suggest that
Bradley has little time to waste in demonstrating an ability to beat Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   The previously undecided Manchester voter said his choice was decided in the
24 hours after Gore's 2-to-1 win over Bradley in Monday's Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I thought Bill Bradley was a hell of a candidate but in the long run, if
Al Gore is going to be the nominee I figured I might as well get on board,''
Sullivan said.

<HEADLINE> Candidates on the Vietnam War  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Three days a week, The Associated Press asks the presidential candidates a
question on the issues. Today's question and the responses:
</P>
<P>
	   Vietnam War
</P>
<P>
	   Fifty-eight thousand Americans, 223,000 South Vietnamese and, by Hanoi's
estimate, 660,000 North Vietnamese and Viet Cong soldiers were killed in
Vietnam. In retrospect, do you believe that war served America's interests? Do
you believe it hastened the collapse of communism?
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats:
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Bradley: ``The Vietnam War began with the honorable intention of
serving America's interests but turned into a tragedy for both America and
Vietnam. The outcome was certainly not in our interests. Communism collapsed
because America won the war of ideas -- democratic institutions and market
economies build strong societies while authoritarian governments with command
economies stunt productivity and stifle human expression.''
</P>
<P>
	   Al Gore: ``The Vietnam War was one of the most painful and costly
experiences in American history. Although I served in Vietnam, like many
Americans, I saw the war as an experience that contributed to doubt and cynicism
about America's future. In the end, the war proved to be unable to prevent the
collapse of South Vietnam and its eventual absorption by the North. I do not
believe that the Vietnam War hastened the collapse of communism. Communism's
ultimate collapse occurred because the Soviet system was so weak at the core
that not even Gorbachev's efforts at reform could save it. Communism also
collapsed because it failed to deliver any of its promises to millions of
ordinary people who craved normal lives free of government oppression and
official terror.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reform:
</P>
<P>
	   Pat Buchanan: ``The Vietnam War was a noble cause, bravely fought by U.S.
soldiers. While Southeast Asia was lost, U.S. arms were never defeated, and the
Vietnam vets bought Asia the vital time it needed to become as free, dynamic and
prosperous as it is today.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans:
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Bauer: ``Costly and heartbreaking as the war was, it retarded Communist
expansionism in Asia and bought precious time for the non-Communist countries of
that region to develop their free institutions.''
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush: No response.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes: ``American leadership to stop the spread of Communism was the
morally right thing to do. But Lyndon Johnson's prosecution of the war -- and
the lies that were told to the American people -- was a disgrace. Thousands upon
thousands of Americans lost their lives. Americans lost faith with the
politicians in Washington, and, for a time, in themselves. When we make a
commitment of U.S. troops, we must give them the tools and the leadership to
finish the job. That's what Ronald Reagan did. That's why he helped America
regain her sense of strength, conviction and purpose and go on to defeat the
Evil Empire.''
</P>
<P>
	   Orrin Hatch: ``There is little question that the war fought against
communist oppression in Vietnam hastened the collapse of communism. It was in
America's interest to put an end to this oppressive system and hasten freedom to
this area of the world.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes: No response.
</P>
<P>
	   John McCain: ``Let me begin by saying that I have no reservations about the
United States fighting to prevent North Vietnam from imposing its will on the
South, and on neighboring countries. I have no moral reservations about the role
I played during the war. The manner in which the war was fought, however, is
where many, myself included, question the entire exercise. Suffice to say that I
am not particularly enamored of the political leadership that dictated the rules
under which the military had to operate. That U.S. policy was never to win the
war by defeating the adversary but rather deny him victory over the South and
was a formula for disaster. I strongly supported normalization of U.S. relations
with Vietnam in 1995 to advance U.S. interests and help put the war behind us.''

Casinos May Aid Child Support Plan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has enlisted an unusual ally in his
effort to squeeze child support payments out of deadbeat parents: the gambling
industry. Clinton's budget for fiscal 2001 will contain a proposal under which
gambling outlets could seize the winnings of patrons who owe child support. The
White House estimates that this maneuver alone could bring in $348 million over
five years. The gambling provision is one of several items in Clinton's budget
seeking to collect $2 billion in back child support in the next five years.

U.S.-Libya Ties Become a Possibility
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Indications that Libya has backed away from its extended
history of radical policies are being carefully monitored by U.S. officials, who
say they are no longer inflexibly opposed to a new relationship with the
oil-rich North African country. "Change can now be imagined," says a top aide in
the State Department. U.S. willingness to reassess its policies is based largely
on the decision of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi last spring to allow two
suspects wanted in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 to be tried.

Grandmothers Eager for Visit With Elian
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The grandmothers of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez are ready
to head to Florida for a government-ordered session with the Cuban boy while
political maneuvering intensifies over legislation to make him a U.S. citizen.
The two women made an impassioned appeal to Congress on Tuesday not to pass such
a bill, saying Elian was a Cuban citizen and belonged with his father and them
in Cuba. "It's our right to see our grandson and take him back home," Mariela
Quintana, the child's paternal grandmother, said. They won't be able to do that
at Wednesday's session with Elian in Miami, however. The meeting was set as just
a visit.

Hormone Combination May Pose Cancer Risk
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Menopausal women using the common hormone supplements
estrogen and progestin run a 20 percent higher risk of breast cancer than those
who use just estrogen, researchers reported Wednesday. While the risk of breast
cancer is still low for women who take both hormones, the increased odds might
further complicate the decision menopausal women must make about their health.
Estrogen is often prescribed to ease hot flashes and other menopause symptoms.
It also has been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease and brittle bones.

Earthquake Jolts Tibet
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   BEIJING (AP) -- A strong earthquake jolted the Himalayan Mountains in Tibet
near the border of Bhutan early Wednesday, but there were no immediate reports
of casualties, China's official Xinhua News Agency reported. The earthquake with
a preliminary magnitude of 5 struck Cona county, 15 miles east of Bhutan, around
12:45 a.m., Xinhua said, citing government seismologists. The region is sparsely
populated and has poor communication links with Tibet's capital.

Snow Paralyzes Parts of East Coast
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A fast-moving storm dumped up to two feet of snow all along
the east coast, closing airports and schools. At least four people were killed
in weather-related traffic accidents in the Carolinas, and a 5-year-old girl was
missing and feared dead in Massachusetts after falling into an icy river while
walking to school in heavy snow. The storm closed major eastern airports,
including New York's LaGuardia and Washington's Reagan National Airport, and
others had delays and cancellations.

Agassi, Sampras Renew Rivalry
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- At a moment when Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras
are playing arguably the best tennis of their lives, they will meet a round too
soon in the Australian Open semifinals. It is the final before the final, a
match that could set up the tournament for an anticlimactic finish. The women
final would be infused with greater drama if Jennifer Capriati and Lindsay
Davenport, Olympic champions who took different paths to reach the same
juncture, were to meet for the title. Instead, they will face each other in the
semifinals.

GOP Nomination Fight Shifts to N.H.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- With the field narrowed by an Iowa defeat, the
Republican presidential candidates were meeting for their final debate before
New Hampshire voters weigh in the nation's first presidential primary next week.
Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, who limped away from Monday night's Iowa caucuses with
1 percent of the vote, planned to drop out of the nominating contest Wednesday,
an aide said. His decision would leave a five-man field with Gary Bauer, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, Alan Keyes and Sen.
John McCain of Arizona.

Casinos May Aid Child Support Plan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has enlisted an unusual ally in his
effort to squeeze child support payments out of deadbeat parents: the gambling
industry. Clinton's budget for fiscal 2001 will contain a proposal under which
gambling outlets could seize the winnings of patrons who owe child support. The
White House estimates that this maneuver alone could bring in $348 million over
five years. The gambling provision is one of several items in Clinton's budget
seeking to collect $2 billion in back child support in the next five years.

U.S.-Libya Ties Become a Possibility
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Indications that Libya has backed away from its extended
history of radical policies are being carefully monitored by U.S. officials, who
say they are no longer inflexibly opposed to a new relationship with the
oil-rich North African country. "Change can now be imagined," says a top aide in
the State Department. U.S. willingness to reassess its policies is based largely
on the decision of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi last spring to allow two
suspects wanted in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 to be tried.

Grandmothers Eager for Visit With Elian
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The grandmothers of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez are ready
to head to Florida for a government-ordered session with the Cuban boy while
political maneuvering intensifies over legislation to make him a U.S. citizen.
The two women made an impassioned appeal to Congress on Tuesday not to pass such
a bill, saying Elian was a Cuban citizen and belonged with his father and them
in Cuba. "It's our right to see our grandson and take him back home," Mariela
Quintana, the child's paternal grandmother, said. They won't be able to do that
at Wednesday's session with Elian in Miami, however. The meeting was set as just
a visit.

Hormone Combination May Pose Cancer Risk
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Menopausal women using the common hormone supplements
estrogen and progestin run a 20 percent higher risk of breast cancer than those
who use just estrogen, researchers reported Wednesday. While the risk of breast
cancer is still low for women who take both hormones, the increased odds might
further complicate the decision menopausal women must make about their health.
Estrogen is often prescribed to ease hot flashes and other menopause symptoms.
It also has been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease and brittle bones.

Earthquake Jolts Tibet
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   BEIJING (AP) -- A strong earthquake jolted the Himalayan Mountains in Tibet
near the border of Bhutan early Wednesday, but there were no immediate reports
of casualties, China's official Xinhua News Agency reported. The earthquake with
a preliminary magnitude of 5 struck Cona county, 15 miles east of Bhutan, around
12:45 a.m., Xinhua said, citing government seismologists. The region is sparsely
populated and has poor communication links with Tibet's capital.

Snow Paralyzes Parts of East Coast

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A fast-moving storm dumped up to two feet of snow all along
the east coast, closing airports and schools. At least four people were killed
in weather-related traffic accidents in the Carolinas, and a 5-year-old girl was
missing and feared dead in Massachusetts after falling into an icy river while
walking to school in heavy snow. The storm closed major eastern airports,
including New York's LaGuardia and Washington's Reagan National Airport, and
others had delays and cancellations.

Agassi, Sampras Renew Rivalry
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- At a moment when Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras
are playing arguably the best tennis of their lives, they will meet a round too
soon in the Australian Open semifinals. It is the final before the final, a
match that could set up the tournament for an anticlimactic finish. The women
final would be infused with greater drama if Jennifer Capriati and Lindsay
Davenport, Olympic champions who took different paths to reach the same
juncture, were to meet for the title. Instead, they will face each other in the
semifinals.

<HEADLINE> Estate Approves 'Picasso' Car  </HEADLINE>
    By MARILYN AUGUST Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARIS (AP) -- Pots and pans in China, underwear in Southeast Asia, trucks in
Chile, and now, a car from France. Hard to believe they're all Picassos.
</P>
<P>
	   In name only, of course. The Paris-based Picasso Estate, which represents
the artist's heirs, spends millions yearly fighting the illicit use of what is
arguably the most famous name in 20th century art.
</P>
<P>
	   Which is why many French were shocked when the Estate gave its blessing --
for a price it refused to reveal -- to the new Citroen Xsara Picasso, a snappy,
high-sitting town car billed as practical and fun to drive.
</P>
<P>
	   Putting the name to the car "is a strategic decision designed to prevent
other companies from stealing the name and using it," said Claudia Andrieu, the
Picasso Estate's legal adviser.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the family's approach to battling fakes," she said in a telephone
interview. "A do-nothing attitude leads to exploitation."
</P>
<P>
	   Some purists, however, are horrified by what they see as crass
commercialism.
</P>
<P>
	   "Assimilating genius with a mass-produced consumer item is scandalous,"
wrote Picasso Museum director Jean Clair in the daily Liberation.
</P>
<P>
	   Clair said he was offended by Citroen's latest ad campaign, which depicts a
tough-looking museum guard restraining a visitor from touching a nude bather in
Picasso's "Figures au bord de la Mer" (Figures At the Shore).
</P>
<P>
	   The visitor then is presented a Picasso he CAN touch -- the new Xsara.
</P>
<P>
	   Clair said the ad ridiculed the Picasso Museum, belittling the guards as
they try to protect its priceless collection of Picasso masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
	   Comparing the museum employees' meager salaries to the hefty royalties
earned by Picasso's heirs, he went on to question the family's motives for
"selling their father's name even though their fortune appears to have sheltered
them from need."
</P>
<P>
	   The Picasso Estate represents the interests of Claude and Paloma Picasso,
the children of Francoise Gilot; Maya Picasso, the daughter of Marie-Therese
Walter; and his grandchildren Marina and Bernard Picasso, born to the artist's
son, Paul.
</P>
<P>
	   Andrieu said the family was not offended by the ad, and stood by its
partnership with Citroen.
</P>
<P>
	   About 15 companies manufacturing products ranging from lighters to candles
have bought the rights to the name, but thousands more use it illegally, Andrieu
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are underwear and inflatable dolls in Southeast Asia, trucks and
spare parts in Chile, mobile homes in Britain, and thousands of products in
China alone," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said the family, with the notable exception of designer Paloma, who has
developed her own line of beauty products and home furnishings, had no intention
of turning Picasso into a brand name.
</P>
<P>
	   Andrieu said the family chose to work with Citroen because of the company's
long-standing image of excellence in design.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're better off with a partner of our choice where we have a say in
things," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Citroen says polls showed that people associated "creativity, invention and
modernity" with Picasso.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our polls show that name recognition for Picasso is enormous, and that's
what we wanted in launching the new model around the world," said Citroen
spokesman Frederic Lepeytre.
</P>
<P>
	   The new Xsara Picasso also is more affordable than the real thing. Models
cost between $19,600-$25,000.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Eyes Debt Payment by 2013  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New federal projections that the surplus could hit up to
$1.9 trillion over the next decade could boost lawmakers' hopes for
election-year tax cuts and spending increases.
</P>
<P>
	   The projection by the Congressional Budget Office virtually doubles the
agency's last estimate in July.
</P>
<P>
	   CBO Director Dan Crippen was set to formally present the figures today to
the Senate Budget Committee. In prepared testimony, he said the estimates were
based on ``the mid-range of possible outcomes'' for economic and budgetary
performance, and conceded actual surpluses ``could be considerably different
from those projections.''
</P>
<P>
	   At least for now, the impact of the new figures is chiefly political.
</P>
<P>
	   On the presidential campaign trail, the new numbers -- almost twice the $1
trillion CBO estimated in the summer -- are good news for leading GOP candidate
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   He has proposed a five-year, $483 billion tax cut that could be paid for by
the new numbers. Some, including Republican candidate Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
have said Bush's plan eats up too much of the projected surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans cited them to claim they lived up to their pledge last fall to
not use Social Security surpluses for other programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Though final figures for fiscal 2000 won't be known until after the year
ends on Sept. 30, CBO projected that there will be a $23 billion surplus this
year without using Social Security's own hefty surpluses. The projected $1.9
trillion surplus, for the decade ending 2010, also excludes Social Security
funds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Republicans are right. They did not spend any money that belongs to
Social Security,'' said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M.
</P>
<P>
	   But Democrats complained that the $1.9 trillion surplus projection was
bloated. They argued that it unrealistically assumes that a large portion of
federal spending will either be frozen at this year's levels, or cut.
</P>
<P>
	   Spratt and other Democrats support an $838 billion, 10-year surplus
projection CBO also issued that assumes spending will grow every year along with
inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Before we get swept away by these projections, we have to closely examine
the premises,'' said Rep. John Spratt of South Carolina, top Democrat on the
House Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of likely political gridlock over many tax and spending proposals
this year, many analysts expect most of the surplus for fiscal 2001 -- which
begins next Oct. 1 -- to go for debt reduction. CBO projected next year's
surplus at up to $69 billion, plus $166 billion in Social Security surpluses.
</P>
<P>
	   But Spratt conceded that the new figures will ``raise everyone's
expectations as to what's possible'' because of the sheer amount of cash.
</P>
<P>
	   With the soaring economy pouring billions in unforeseen revenue into federal
coffers, President Clinton said he will propose paying off the government's
entire $3.6 trillion federally held debt by 2013. That would be two years
earlier than he has previously aimed for, and puts him a step ahead of House
Republicans, who are working on a plan to pay off that portion of the debt by
2015.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I ask the Republican majority in Congress to put politics aside and join
me,'' he said at the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton provided no details about how he would eliminate the publicly held
debt, which is money the government owes investors who hold Treasury bonds,
bills and notes. The remaining $2 trillion of the $5.7 trillion national debt is
money held by the Social Security and other trust funds.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said his plan, to be included in the fiscal 2001 budget he releases
Feb. 7, will devote interest savings to Social Security, extending its solvency
beyond 2050. It will also seek to ensure Medicare's survival until at least
2025, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Taking a swipe at Republicans, the president said the national debt is $1.7
trillion less this year than was projected when he took office in 1993, despite
``repeated efforts to push us off the path of fiscal discipline with large and
irresponsible tax cuts.''
</P>
<P>
	   But GOP lawmakers scoffed at his plan, noting that he has already revealed
dozens of budget proposals that will cost tens of billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you're spiritual, it seems kind of miraculous'' that he can eliminate
the debt and boost spending, said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete
Domenici, R-N.M. ``If you're not, it sounds kind of magic.''
</P>
<P>
	   Including Social Security's surpluses, CBO projected that over the decade,
federal black ink would total as much as $4.23 trillion.

<HEADLINE> Appraiser describes, defends methodology for valuing land  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - The $335 million pricetag an expert land appraiser
has placed on the Cayuga Indian Nation's lost ancestral lands was derived
methodically, a federal court jury was told.
<P>
	   Arvel M. Hale spent Tuesday explaining and defending his appraisal approach
to jurors against a steady stream of questions and objections from the state's
attorney as the damages trial concluded its second day.
</P>
<P>
	   The nine-member jury must decide how much money the Cayugas should receive
for 64,015 acres of their former territory in Seneca and Cayuga counties.
Presiding Judge Neal McCurn previously ruled that the land was illegally
acquired by New York state in 1795 and 1807 because the state did not obtain the
federal government's required approval for the transactions.
</P>
<P>
	   The state has said the land is worth no more than $46 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to questions Tuesday from Justice Department lawyer Hank
Meshorer, Hale described in detail how he used county real estate records on
land use and data on selected sales to come up with his figure of $264.7 million
for the present-day fair market value of the land.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, during his first day on the witness stand, Hale testified that 69
percent of the claim area was in agricultural use while another 17 percent was
residential. Eight percent of the land was vacant while the remainder was either
wild forest or parks or used for commercial, recreational, community service,
industrial or public service purposes, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   To reach his conclusion, Hale said he considered 5,647 tracts in the claim
area. Assistant Attorney General David Roberts made sure jurors knew that Hale
only briefly toured the area and did not inspect the tracts individually.
</P>
<P>
	   Hale acknowledged that he didn't actually appraise any of the properties
himself. Instead, he obtained records on 14,407 property sales, a number he
pared down to 153 by eliminating all sales that occurred before 1996 and all
sales that involved improved tracts.
</P>
<P>
	   In a prior ruling, McCurn said the land must be valued as unimproved
property.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts again tried to undermine Hale's approach by questioning how
extensively he reviewed each record.
</P>
<P>
	   "You didn't personally review each individual sale? You hit a button on your
computer and ran a program?" Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I did not physically look at each record ... I wrote the program for the
computer. I developed the rules," Hale said in defense of his method.
</P>
<P>
	   As Hale went over his appraisal method, he used a computer and video screen
to help jurors understand his approach. Roberts challenged several of the charts
as they were introduced into evidence.
</P>
<P>
	   Hale also testified that he used a three-pronged analysis to derive at an
additional rental value of $70.4 million for the use and occupancy of the land
over 204 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Because only spotty records existed between 1795-1899, Hale said he
established a rental value for that period by considering all the land
agricultural and then using deeds and sales records to determine what the
average fair market price was for an acre for each year during that span.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he set the rental value at 6 percent of the fair market value after
researching what a fair rate of return was during those years based on the
interest rates on government treasury bonds and on the interest rate New York
assessed when it sold off the Cayuga land at public auction in 1796.
</P>
<P>
	   The state's appraiser set the rental value at 2 percent and Roberts raised
repeated questions about Hale's decision to use 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   For the period from 1900-1960, Hale told jurors he based the land's rental
value on commodity yields and prices because there were no reliable rental
records available. For the modern era, he was able to use actual rental data
obtained from U.S Department of Agriculture reports, Hale testified.
</P>
<P>
	   Testimony continues today.

<HEADLINE> Innocent Plea in Shields Stalk Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A man has pleaded innocent to stalking Brooke Shields.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Ronald Bailey was charged with stalking the actress, who stars on NBC's
"Suddenly Susan," as well as counts involving possession of a firearm by a felon
and possession of a firearm with identification numbers removed.
</P>
<P>
	   After entering the pleas Tuesday, Superior Court Judge Glenette Blackwell
ordered Bailey back to court Thursday for a preliminary hearing. He remained
jailed in lieu of $500,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
	   Miss Shields' publicist, Mia Ricchiuti, said the actress won't discuss the
case with the news media.

<HEADLINE> Dems Bash Bigger Surplus Projection  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New federal projections that the surplus could hit up to
$1.9 trillion over the next decade could boost lawmakers' hopes for
election-year tax cuts and spending increases.
</P>
<P>
	   The projection by the Congressional Budget Office virtually doubles the
agency's last estimate in July.
</P>
<P>
	   CBO Director Dan Crippen was set to formally present the figures today to
the Senate Budget Committee. In prepared testimony, he said the estimates were
based on ``the mid-range of possible outcomes'' for economic and budgetary
performance, and conceded actual surpluses ``could be considerably different
from those projections.''
</P>
<P>
	   At least for now, the impact of the new figures is chiefly political.
</P>
<P>
	   On the presidential campaign trail, the new numbers -- almost twice the $1
trillion CBO estimated in the summer -- are good news for leading GOP candidate
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   He has proposed a five-year, $483 billion tax cut that could be paid for by
the new numbers. Some, including candidate Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., have said
Bush's plan eats up too much of the projected surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans cited them to claim they lived up to their pledge last fall to
not use Social Security surpluses for other programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Though final figures for fiscal 2000 won't be known until after the year
ends on Sept. 30, CBO projected that there will be a $23 billion surplus this
year without using Social Security's own hefty surpluses. The projected $1.9
trillion surplus, for the decade ending 2010, also excludes Social Security
funds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Republicans are right. They did not spend any money that belongs to
Social Security,'' said the Senate Budget Committee chairman, Sen. Pete
Domenici, R-N.M.
</P>
<P>
	   But Democrats complained that the $1.9 trillion surplus projection was
bloated. They argued that it unrealistically assumes that a large portion of
federal spending will either be frozen at this year's levels, or cut.
</P>
<P>
	   Spratt and other Democrats support an $838 billion, 10-year surplus
projection CBO also issued that assumes spending will grow every year along with
inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Before we get swept away by these projections, we have to closely examine
the premises,'' said Rep. John Spratt of South Carolina, top Democrat on the
House Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of likely political gridlock over many tax and spending proposals
this year, many analysts expect most of the surplus for fiscal 2001 -- which
begins next Oct. 1 -- to go for debt reduction. CBO projected next year's
surplus at up to $69 billion, plus $166 billion in Social Security surpluses.
</P>
<P>
	   But Spratt conceded that the new figures will ``raise everyone's
expectations as to what's possible'' because of the sheer amount of cash.
</P>
<P>
	   With the soaring economy pouring billions in unforeseen revenue into federal
coffers, President Clinton said he will propose paying off the government's
entire $3.6 trillion federally held debt by 2013. That would be two years
earlier than he has previously aimed for, and puts him a step ahead of House
Republicans, who are working on a plan to pay off that portion of the debt by
2015.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I ask the Republican majority in Congress to put politics aside and join
me,'' he said at the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton provided no details about how he would eliminate the publicly held
debt, which is money the government owes investors who hold Treasury bonds,
bills and notes. The remaining $2 trillion of the $5.7 trillion national debt is
money held by the Social Security and other trust funds.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said his plan, to be included in the fiscal 2001 budget he releases
Feb. 7, will devote interest savings to Social Security, extending its solvency
beyond 2050. It will also seek to ensure Medicare's survival until at least
2025, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Taking a swipe at Republicans, the president said the national debt is $1.7
trillion less this year than was projected when he took office in 1993, despite
``repeated efforts to push us off the path of fiscal discipline with large and
irresponsible tax cuts.''
</P>
<P>
	   But GOP lawmakers scoffed at his plan, noting that he has already revealed
dozens of budget proposals that will cost tens of billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you're spiritual, it seems kind of miraculous'' that he can eliminate
the debt and boost spending, said Domenici. ``If you're not, it sounds kind of
magic.''
</P>
<P>
	   Including Social Security's surpluses, CBO projected that over the decade,
federal black ink would total as much as $4.23 trillion.

<HEADLINE> Updates 3rd, 4th &AMP; 5th grafs to include report that Democrats  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Sen. John McCain, looking for a boost for his
presidential hopes, could get an indication today how many New York Republicans
will get to see his name on the ballot for the state's March 7 GOP presidential
primary.
<P>
	   McCain was knocked off the ballot in three congressional districts this week
by local election officials after state Republicans challenged the signatures on
the Arizona senator's presidential petitions.
</P>
<P>
	   The four-member state Board of Elections today will consider challenges to
McCain's presidential petitions in eight additional congressional districts. On
the four-member Board of Elections - two Democrats and two Republicans - three
votes are requird to declare petitions invalid.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Times reported today that, in a break from tradition, McCain's
cause would be supported by the Democrats on the board. That would leave
McCain's delegate slates on the primary ballot in those districts, but would
likely also lead to a battle in the state's courts over the move.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are going to vote to leave him on the ballot," state Senate Minority
Leader Martin Connor, a New York City Democrat and top election law lawyer, told
The Times. "For a presidential campaign, we ought to put all the legitimate
candidates on the ballot."
</P>
<P>
	   State Republican leaders, who support Texas Gov. George W. Bush, had
challenged McCain's petitions in 16 of New York's 31 congressional districts,
claiming he failed to obtain the required number of signatures from party
members.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain will not sue to overturn the dismissals for the South Bronx and
Suffolk County districts, McCain campaign lawyer Henry Berger said. However, any
other possible disqualification will be challenged, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, in the 12th Congressional District covering parts of Manhattan,
Brooklyn and Queens, McCain is only missing one signature. That signature was
disqualified because the signer put the wrong house number on the petition,
Berger said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are one short because of a technicality," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   That one will be challenged in court, Berger said.
</P>
<P>
	   With polls showing McCain running ahead of Bush in New Hampshire, the battle
over the New York primary ballot has taken on extra significance.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, GOP candidates must get a certain number of signatures from
party members to qualify for separate convention delegate slates in each of the
state's 31 congressional districts in which they wish to compete. In effect,
there are 31 separate GOP primaries in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Should the challenges be upheld by the state Board of Elections, and
possibly by state courts thereafter, McCain could be without convention delegate
slates in more than half of the state.
</P>
<P>
	   The board hopes to certify the New York primary ballot by Jan. 31, but court
challenges could delay the final primary ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has also sued to get on the New York primary ballot. McCain's lawsuit
will be heard in federal court in Brooklyn Friday at 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also faces some petition challenges of his own from publisher Steve
Forbes in six New York City congressional districts. "We are highly, highly
confident we will prevail," said Jeff Buley, who works for the state Republican
Committee in support of Bush.

<HEADLINE> Hearing Opens on American Air Crash  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID A. LIEB Assocaited Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Their plane rocked by high winds on its approach
to Little Rock, two American Airlines pilots realized their jet was ``way off''
course just moments before it crashed, broke up and caught fire.
</P>
<P>
	   A transcript of American Airlines Flight 1420's cockpit voice recorder was
released today in advance of a National Transportation Safety Board hearing on
the June 1 crash. Eleven people were killed in the accident and 89 were injured.
</P>
<P>
	   As ominous clouds rolled toward the airport from the northwest with heavy
rain, wind and hail, the plane made a ``bowling alley'' approach from the
southwest, according to previously released control tower tapes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going right into this crap,'' co-pilot Michael Origel said to Capt.
Richard Buschmann as the plane approached the airport. Buschmann, who died in
the crash, had complained seconds earlier about making a visual approach to the
airport in bad weather at night.
</P>
<P>
	   Origel was to be the first witness called today at the NTSB hearing, which
is expected to run through Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   About a minute before landing, Buschmann complained: ``This is a can of
worms'' but continued toward the airport. When the plane was several hundred
feet from the runway, the pilot uttered an expletive and said, ``We're off
course.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're way off,'' Origel replied.
</P>
<P>
	   The co-pilot told NTSB investigators the plane landed with its main landing
gear to the right of the runway and the nose of the plane pointing to the left.
The jet went into a slide and ran off the north end of the runway, down an
embankment and nose-first into steel supports for the airport navigation system.
</P>
<P>
	   At its hearing, the NTSB will look at weather conditions, decision-making
and the plane's mechanical operations, among other things.
</P>
<P>
	   The crash was deadliest on U.S. soil in 1999, although 217 were killed in
the crash of an EgyptAir jet off the Massachusetts island of Nantucket on Oct.
31.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, the Federal Aviation Administration released a transcript of
conversations between the cockpit of Flight 1420 and the Little Rock air traffic
control tower that included repeated warnings about a strong thunderstorm and
high winds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have heavy rain on the airport. ... The visibility is less than a
mile,'' the tower informed the cockpit about three minutes before it was to have
touched down shortly before midnight. A minute later the tower gave a wind shear
alert. Wind shears -- sudden, dangerous shifts in wind speed and direction --
are considered major hazards to aircraft as they land or take off.
</P>
<P>
	   Passenger Arnold Bowden said he felt a strong northwest wind that moved the
plane just seconds before it landed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When I first felt the wind and we got hit by rain simultaneously, I said,
`I don't think he's going to make the runway! Get down!''' Bowden recalled
Tuesday. ``We grabbed our knees and bent forward.''
</P>
<P>
	   A summary of the NTSB's findings -- but no theories -- is to be released at
the end of the hearing. A final report on the crash, and its cause, isn't
expected until some time later.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 400 people were killed last year in aircraft accidents in the
United States, its territories and international waters, according to the NTSB.
</P>
<P>
	   Flight 1420's cockpit voice recording picks up with the plane about 100
miles southwest of Little Rock and the pilots noticing lightning in the
distance.
</P>
<P>
	   Previously released transcripts between the plane and the Little Rock
control tower described a break in the storms as a ``bowling alley'' through
which the pilots would try to reach the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Buschmann is heard on the cockpit recording saying, ``This is the bowling
alley right here'' shortly before beginning his descent.
</P>
<P>
	   But the pilots were still concerned about the storms. At several times, they
make references to getting to the airport ``as soon as we can,'' as Origel put
it.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no discussion between the pilots in the last 100 miles of the
flight about diverting to another airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Origel told an NTSB investigator that he ``felt a sense of urgency to land
at (Little Rock) because the weather was moving in.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was no discussion of delaying or diverting the landing,'' Origel
said, according to an NTSB report also released this morning.
</P>
<P>
	   Less than 10 minutes before touching down, Buschmann said he could not see
the airport, but then picked up a view of the runway later.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hate droning around visual at night in weather without ... having some
clue where I am,'' Buschmann said about five minutes before touchdown.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yeah, but, the longer we go out here, the...'' Origel said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yeah, I know,'' Buschmann responded.

<HEADLINE> Judge: allow television coverage of Diallo trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Although a judge surprisingly ruled to allow a
television camera in the trial of Amadou Diallo's alleged killers, court experts
warn other New York trials might not immediately be seen on the small screen.
<P>
	   Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi said New York's law banning cameras from
the courtroom is unconstitutional and Court TV will be allowed to broadcast the
Diallo trial beginning with opening arguments. "The denial of access to the vast
majority will accomplish nothing but more divisiveness," Teresi said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Teresi said his ruling should apply not only to the Diallo
trial but to all other trials in the state. However, it was unclear whether an
Albany judge's ruling would be binding on other judges around the state.
</P>
<P>
	   "A court in Buffalo will probably take note of the order issued by the
learned Judge Teresi but say, 'I'm not bound by this order and I'm free to
reconsider this issue and I respectively disagree,"' said James Acker, a
professor at the State University of New York at Albany. "I think that the other
judges are certainly not bound by Teresi's order."
</P>
<P>
	   Court TV had asked Teresi to allow a camera into the courtroom when he
presides over the trial of the four police officers accused of killing the West
African immigrant. The judge ruled that one of the cable network's cameras can
record the proceedings and that Court TV must share the feed with other
networks.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're delighted that Judge Teresi has affirmed the right of open courtroom
proceedings in New York state," said Henry Schleiff, Court TV's chairman and
chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
	   Allowing the trial to be televised will "further the interests of justice,
enhance public understanding of the judicial system and maintain a high level of
public confidence in the judiciary," Teresi wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   No mention was made of allowing a still camera into the trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard N. Winfield, an attorney for The Associated Press, said the news
cooperative and a group of newspapers were studying the ruling "and were
contemplating seeking a clarification from Judge Teresi that would enable a
still camera pool to cover the trial."
</P>
<P>
	   Only two states, South Dakota and Mississippi, now completely prohibit
cameras, according to the list compiled by the Radio and Television News
Directors' Association.
</P>
<P>
	   A Bronx judge refused another network's request to allow television coverage
of the trial. But a state appeals court moved the officers' trial to Albany
after defense lawyers argued that a fair and impartial jury could not be
assembled in the Bronx, allowing Court TV to make its request to a different
judge. Jury selection begins Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   A grand jury indicted the plain clothes officers in March 1999 after they
fired 41 bullets at Diallo, an unarmed street vendor from West Africa, while
searching a Bronx neighborhood for a rape suspect on Feb. 4, 1999. Diallo was
hit by 19 bullets.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for the officers - Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and
Richard Murphy - have said their clients mistakenly believed the victim was
reaching for a gun. The four officers were charged with second-degree murder.
All pleaded innocent.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense lawyer Stephen Worth, who represents McMellon, said the defense had
no immediate plans to appeal. "We respect his ruling and this will probably be a
good thing for everyone," Worth said. "I think this will stop this issue that in
any way things are being hidden and that once the public sees all the evidence
they're going to understand why these officers did what they did."
</P>
<P>
	   Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson generally supports having cameras in
courtrooms, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer will not appeal Teresi's ruling either,
spokesman Marc Violette said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is not uncommon for the attorney general not to be allowed in a
challenge of the constitutionality of state laws," Violette said. However,
Spitzer will reevaluate if the issue gets appealed to the state Court of Appeal,
the state's highest court.
</P>
<P>
	   It has been almost three years since trials and criminal court hearings were
televised in New York. Audio and video recording was first allowed into New
York's trial courts in 1987, but only on an experimental basis.
</P>
<P>
	   The last extender expired in June 1997 and state lawmakers have, thus far,
refused to renew the law allowing television and audio recording equipment back
into the state's trial courts.

<HEADLINE> Snowplow accident kills one as surprise storm hits eastern New  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. (AP) - Hudson Valley residents were digging out from
a surprisingly severe nor'easter that dumped up to 14 inches of snow.
<P>
	   The storm that started Tuesday was blamed for at least one death in upstate
New York: a collision with a snow plow on the Thruway killed a driver and left
six of her relatives seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
	   In many areas of eastern New York on Tuesday, traffic was light on the
snowed over roads that crews worked overtime to clear. Businesses closed,
flights were grounded, and hundreds of schools canceled classes - distressing
some students who had prepared for Regents tests.
</P>
<P>
	   But the storm had passed by today. Dennis Michalski of the State Emergency
Management Office said there were no new reports of trouble from the storm this
morning.
</P>
<P>
	   "It seems like everyone is dealing with the storm," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   An inch or two more is expected today in central and eastern New York, and
forecasters said there's a chance Syracuse could get a particularly hard blast
from the lake effect.
</P>
<P>
	   Catherine Simmons, 61, of Kingston, died after she lost control of her
vehicle and rammed into the back of a snowplow around 2 p.m. in Saugerties,
state police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Maryann Merritt, 35, of Troy, and five other relatives, ages 5, 8, 9, 12 and
16, were transported to area hospitals. The plow driver was uninjured, according
to officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Slick conditions shut down the Taconic State Parkway south of Interstate 84
Tuesday from 8 a.m. until after 1 p.m., according to state officials.
</P>
<P>
	   "There were vehicles sliding off the roadway," said Purdy Halstead,
assistant to the regional director of the DOT.
</P>
<P>
	   The DOT also closed a stretch of Route 9G in Staatsburg for about an hour
after a car carrier swerving to avoid another car overturned on the shoulder.
Hyde Park police reported no injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   In most areas, officials said drivers avoided going out.
</P>
<P>
	   "They've closed the world so no one is on the highways," DeWitt Sagendorph,
coordinator of Dutchess County's Emergency Response Department, told the
Poughkeepsie Journal.
</P>
<P>
	   In Greene County, which had the greatest accumulation with 14 inches in East
Jewett, sheriff's deputies reported a relatively quiet night, and crews
continued removing snow even around 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   In Hyde Park, Rotterdam and the town of Catskill, the National Weather
Service said 10 inches of snow piled up. Albany received 7.6 inches by 10:30
p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   In a rare twist, some students were upset that classes - and tests - were
canceled.
</P>
<P>
	   "I heard it on the radio in the morning and was disappointed," high school
senior Linda Angarita, who was prepared to take one of the Regents exams, said.
"I was looking forward to taking it because I wanted to get it over with."
</P>
<P>
	   Most students will now have to wait until June or August to take the tests,
state education officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Wappingers, district officials waited until the last possible minute
before canceling Regents tests.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our original announcement was if you make it in, we'll give you the test,"
said Superintendent Wayne Gersen. "Then, we decided when snow was accumulating
rapidly to cancel the exams. About five students showed up."
</P>
<P>
	   And the harsh January weather could mean more bad news for summer. Some
school districts' allotment of snow days has been depleted, meaning another bout
of bad weather could bring shorter spring vacations.
</P>
<P>
	   But 10-year-old Albany resident Anathea Gil was not worried about that
Tuesday. Instead, she profited from the weather, earning $21 for shoveling
neighbor's walkways.
</P>
<P>
	   She planned to add the money from other snowfalls to spend on a birthday
party for her dog. With Tuesday's take, she said, "We're inviting EVERY single
dog in the neighborhood."
</P>
<P>
	   Checker Cab drivers in Albany were out to make a buck too, despite dangerous
road conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's too good a tip day - people love you when you get someplace,"
dispatcher Zeke Marlaland said. "They're aggravated that it takes so long, but
they're happy when they see that red cab pull up and they're happy when they get
where they're going."
</P>
<P>
	   In Schenectady, Revere Video employee Joyce Hoffman also worked through the
storm. As snowbound families sought entertainment, copies of "Runaway Bride"
disappeared by early afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   "It has been a busy day," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   State emergency management officials had staff on hand at their Albany
headquarters overnight, but on Tuesday evening reported no major requests from
counties for help.
</P>
<P>
	   Albany airport officials said 95 percent of flights were canceled.
</P>
<P>
	   At Stewart International Airport, to the south, most flights took off with
only minor delays, except for those canceled because they were destined for
regions to the south and east.

<HEADLINE> Slushy streets, slippery roads are the aftermath of storm  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - For some, it was a work of art. For others it was just
extra work, and for at least one man the second snowstorm of the season was
deadly.
<P>
	   Police said Rocco Marabello, 58, of Staten Island, died after suffering a
heart attack while shoveling snow. It was the only known death attributed to
Tuesday's storm that blanketed the city and its suburbs with 6 to 9 inches of
snow.
</P>
<P>
	   A fresh sheet of a few inches fell overnight and commuters had to deal with
a second day of slushy streets, slippery roads and, in the suburbs, hundreds of
delayed school openings.
</P>
<P>
	   All public schools in Rockland and Putnam counties were on delayed openings,
as well as most in Westchester and Long Island.
</P>
<P>
	   Public schools in the city and all three metropolitan area airports were
open today. LaGuardia Airport, closed for six hours on Tuesday, was opened but
all shuttle flights to Washington were cancelled due to weather problems in
Washington, which was also hit hard by the storm.
</P>
<P>
	   "It looks like we're starting to get back to normal," said Port Authority
spokesman Steve Coleman. But he advised travelers to check with airlines. Delays
were likely to occur throughout the day as the airlines try to accommodate
hoardes of passengers whose flights were cancelled on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm interrupted normal routines and plans of natives and tourists
alike.
</P>
<P>
	   Susan Dillon, 29, didn't get to complete her daily morning run in Central
Park. "My running shoes are no match for the snow. I was sliding and sliding,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tourist Faye Roberton, of Worthing, England, was surprised that the storm,
which was less intense in Manhattan than its outer boroughs and suburbs, forced
the closure of the Empire State observatory.

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices have opened mixed on Wall Street. The Dow
Jones industrial average is up 3 points in today's early going. Advancing issues
on the New York Stock Exchange hold a nine-to-seven lead over decliners.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index is off 17 points and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
stock index is down 2 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts say yesterday's late recovery for the major averages gives the
market a slight bit of upward momentum.
</P>
<P>
	   And with generally positive corporate earnings news, stocks could make gains
today on an individual basis.
</P>
<P>
	   Bond prices are higher as well -- another positive for stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   But, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is due to appear later today at
Senate confirmation hearings, and that appearance may well keep investors
cautious.

<HEADLINE> Snowplow accident kills one as surprise storm hits eastern New  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. (AP) - Hudson Valley residents are digging out from
14-inches left by a nor'easter that dumped up to 14 inches of snow while a
couple hundred miles to the north much of the Adirondack mountains recorded a
disappointing 4 inches.
<P>
	   The storm that started Tuesday was blamed for at least one death in upstate
New York: a collision with a snow plow on the Thruway killed a driver and left
six of her relatives seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
	   In many areas of eastern New York on Tuesday, traffic was light on the
snowed over roads that crews worked overtime to clear. Businesses closed,
flights were grounded, and hundreds of schools canceled classes - distressing
some students who had prepared for Regents tests.
</P>
<P>
	   But the storm had passed by today. Dennis Michalski of the State Emergency
Management Office said there were no new reports of trouble from the storm this
morning.
</P>
<P>
	   "It seems like everyone is dealing with the storm," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   An inch or two more is expected today in central and eastern New York, and
forecasters said there's a chance Syracuse could get a particularly hard blast
from the lake effect.
</P>
<P>
	   Catherine Simmons, 61, of Kingston, died after she lost control of her
vehicle and rammed into the back of a snowplow around 2 p.m. in Saugerties,
state police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Maryann Merritt, 35, of Troy, and five other relatives, ages 5, 8, 9, 12 and
16, were transported to area hospitals. The plow driver was uninjured, according
to officials.
</P>
<P>
	   In other areas of New York well versed in dealing with severe winter storms,
there wasn't one.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is mild. Most of the people here are disappointed," said Trooper R.J.
Tempestilli of the Ray Brook state police station in the Adirondacks crossroads
of Ray Brook. "The storm came, there was big hype - 'big storm coming' - but
we're still waiting."
</P>
<P>
	   The morning commute ended Wednesday with no serious accidents reported along
major highways. The Thruway had a few minor accidents and a few cars plowed into
snow banks, but there were no serious injuries, said Sgt. Brian Dollard.
</P>
<P>
	   Slick conditions shut down the Taconic State Parkway south of Interstate 84
Tuesday from 8 a.m. until after 1 p.m., according to state officials.
</P>
<P>
	   "There were vehicles sliding off the roadway," said Purdy Halstead,
assistant to the regional director of the DOT.
</P>
<P>
	   The DOT also closed a stretch of Route 9G in Staatsburg for about an hour
after a car carrier swerving to avoid another car overturned on the shoulder.
Hyde Park police reported no injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   In most areas, officials said drivers avoided going out.
</P>
<P>
	   "They've closed the world so no one is on the highways," DeWitt Sagendorph,
coordinator of Dutchess County's Emergency Response Department, told the
Poughkeepsie Journal.
</P>
<P>
	   In Greene County, which had the greatest accumulation with 14 inches in East
Jewett, sheriff's deputies reported a relatively quiet night, and crews
continued removing snow even around 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   In Hyde Park, Rotterdam and the town of Catskill, the National Weather
Service said 10 inches of snow piled up. Albany received 7.6 inches by 10:30
p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   In a rare twist, some students were upset that classes - and tests - were
canceled.
</P>
<P>
	   "I heard it on the radio in the morning and was disappointed," high school
senior Linda Angarita, who was prepared to take one of the Regents exams, said.
"I was looking forward to taking it because I wanted to get it over with."
</P>
<P>
	   Most students will now have to wait until June or August to take the tests,
state education officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Wappingers, district officials waited until the last possible minute
before canceling Regents tests.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our original announcement was if you make it in, we'll give you the test,"
said Superintendent Wayne Gersen. "Then, we decided when snow was accumulating
rapidly to cancel the exams. About five students showed up."
</P>
<P>
	   And the harsh January weather could mean more bad news for summer. Some
school districts' allotment of snow days has been depleted, meaning another bout
of bad weather could bring shorter spring vacations.
</P>
<P>
	   But 10-year-old Albany resident Anathea Gil was not worried about that
Tuesday. Instead, she profited from the weather, earning $21 for shoveling
neighbor's walkways.
</P>
<P>
	   She planned to add the money from other snowfalls to spend on a birthday
party for her dog. With Tuesday's take, she said, "We're inviting EVERY single
dog in the neighborhood."
</P>
<P>
	   Checker Cab drivers in Albany were out to make a buck too, despite dangerous
road conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's too good a tip day - people love you when you get someplace,"
dispatcher Zeke Marlaland said. "They're aggravated that it takes so long, but
they're happy when they see that red cab pull up and they're happy when they get
where they're going."
</P>
<P>
	   In Schenectady, Revere Video employee Joyce Hoffman also worked through the
storm. As snowbound families sought entertainment, copies of "Runaway Bride"
disappeared by early afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Albany airport officials said 95 percent of flights were canceled.
</P>
<P>
	   At Stewart International Airport, to the south, most flights took off with
only minor delays, except for those canceled because they were destined for
regions to the south and east.

<HEADLINE> Yale study ponders psychology of bad hair days  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - If the bad hair on your head is turning you into
a head case, a Yale University researcher has news for you.
<P>
	   The study of the psychology of bad hair days, done at Yale but paid for by
Procter &AMP; Gamble, found that people's self-esteem goes awry when their hair is
out of place.
</P>
<P>
	   The results themselves are not surprising: Bad hair days make people feel,
well, bad.
</P>
<P>
	   But it's the way those days mess with people's lives - making them feel less
smart, less capable, more embarrassed and less sociable - that surprised
researchers.
</P>
<P>
	   Professor Marianne LaFrance, who has also studied the psychology of smiles,
facial expressions and body language, said she would continue to look into the
larger effect bad hair has on people's lives.
</P>
<P>
	   "We all do research that at first pass might seem quite small. Yes, some of
my colleagues said, 'That's interesting, ha, ha.' But then, when we talk about
it, people are interested. People have pointed out more than once that God is in
the details," LaFrance said.
</P>
<P>
	   Contrary to popular notions, men's self-esteem may take a greater licking
than women's when their hair just won't behave. Men were especially more likely
to feel less smart and less capable when their hair stuck out, was badly cut or
otherwise mussed, the study found.
</P>
<P>
	   "The cultural truism is (that) men are not affected by their appearance,"
LaFrance said. "This is not just the domain of women."
</P>
<P>
	   Procter &AMP; Gamble plans a new hair care line called Physique intended to
provide more control over hair.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cincinnati-based company would not discuss how much the study cost or
what they planned to do with their newfound knowledge about the psychology of
bad hair. But a spokeswoman for the company promised to share the study results.
</P>
<P>
	   "People across America know bad hair days exist, but consumers wonder, 'Is
this real?"' said spokeswoman Tracey Long.
</P>
<P>
	   Janet Hyde, a psychology professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison
who conducts studies of body image and self-esteem, said personal appearance can
have an enormous impact on people, especially adolescents.
</P>
<P>
	   But Hyde, who had not seen LaFrance's study, said she was surprised to hear
that bad hair had a stronger effect on men than on women in some cases.
</P>
<P>
	   "Traditionally we think of women being more concerned with appearance than
men. Although men certainly have some concerns, women are more socialized to
think these things are important," Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
	   For the study, researchers in December questioned 60 men and 60 women ages
17 to 30, most of them Yale students. About half the students were white, 9
percent were black, 21 percent were Asian, 3 percent were Hispanic and the rest
were other races or did not answer.
</P>
<P>
	   The people were divided into three groups. One group was questioned about
times in their lives when they have had bad hair and what bad hair means to
them.
</P>
<P>
	   The second group went through the same questions, but were instead told to
think about bad packaging, as a way to get them in a negative mindset.
</P>
<P>
	   The third group was not asked to think about anything negative.
</P>
<P>
	   All three groups then were asked to respond to basic psychological tests on
self-esteem and self-judgment.
</P>
<P>
	   The people who pondered their bad hair days showed lower self-esteem than
the people who thought about something else.
</P>
<P>
	   Some people seemed surprised to hear that Yale was studying something as
mundane as bad hair, but sufferers said they were interested in what science can
reveal about the fickleness of their follicles.
</P>
<P>
	   Andrea Thomas of East Haven, who tames her thick, dark hair into a neatly
feathered style, said she has wrestled with bad hair days and the bad moods they
bring.
</P>
<P>
	   "On humid days, it gets really frizzy or limp and I can't do anything,"
Thomas said. "You just have a bad day in general, but during the course of the
day you learn to live with it."

<HEADLINE> RETRANSMITTING with "p" category. Updates 3rd, 4th &AMP; 5th  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Sen. John McCain, looking for a boost for his
presidential hopes, could get an indication today how many New York Republicans
will get to see his name on the ballot for the state's March 7 GOP presidential
primary.
<P>
	   McCain was knocked off the ballot in three congressional districts this week
by local election officials after state Republicans challenged the signatures on
the Arizona senator's presidential petitions.
</P>
<P>
	   The four-member state Board of Elections today will consider challenges to
McCain's presidential petitions in eight additional congressional districts. On
the four-member Board of Elections - two Democrats and two Republicans - three
votes are requird to declare petitions invalid.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Times reported today that, in a break from tradition, McCain's
cause would be supported by the Democrats on the board. That would leave
McCain's delegate slates on the primary ballot in those districts, but would
likely also lead to a battle in the state's courts over the move.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are going to vote to leave him on the ballot," state Senate Minority
Leader Martin Connor, a New York City Democrat and top election law lawyer, told
The Times. "For a presidential campaign, we ought to put all the legitimate
candidates on the ballot."
</P>
<P>
	   State Republican leaders, who support Texas Gov. George W. Bush, had
challenged McCain's petitions in 16 of New York's 31 congressional districts,
claiming he failed to obtain the required number of signatures from party
members.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain will not sue to overturn the dismissals for the South Bronx and
Suffolk County districts, McCain campaign lawyer Henry Berger said. However, any
other possible disqualification will be challenged, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, in the 12th Congressional District covering parts of Manhattan,
Brooklyn and Queens, McCain is only missing one signature. That signature was
disqualified because the signer put the wrong house number on the petition,
Berger said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are one short because of a technicality," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   That one will be challenged in court, Berger said.
</P>
<P>
	   With polls showing McCain running ahead of Bush in New Hampshire, the battle
over the New York primary ballot has taken on extra significance.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, GOP candidates must get a certain number of signatures from
party members to qualify for separate convention delegate slates in each of the
state's 31 congressional districts in which they wish to compete. In effect,
there are 31 separate GOP primaries in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Should the challenges be upheld by the state Board of Elections, and
possibly by state courts thereafter, McCain could be without convention delegate
slates in more than half of the state.
</P>
<P>
	   The board hopes to certify the New York primary ballot by Jan. 31, but court
challenges could delay the final primary ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has also sued to get on the New York primary ballot. McCain's lawsuit
will be heard in federal court in Brooklyn Friday at 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also faces some petition challenges of his own from publisher Steve
Forbes in six New York City congressional districts. "We are highly, highly
confident we will prevail," said Jeff Buley, who works for the state Republican
Committee in support of Bush.

<HEADLINE> Slushy streets, slippery roads are the aftermath of storm  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - For some, it was a work of art. For others it was just
extra work, and for at least one man the second snowstorm of the season was
deadly.
<P>
	   Police said Rocco Marabello, 58, of Staten Island, died after suffering a
heart attack while shoveling snow. It was the only known death attributed to
Tuesday's storm that blanketed the city and its suburbs with 6 to 9 inches of
snow.
</P>
<P>
	   A fresh sheet of a few inches fell overnight and commuters had to deal with
a second day of slushy streets, slippery roads and, in the suburbs, hundreds of
delayed school openings.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't mind this. Just like I don't mind paying $1.50 for gas and $2 for
heating oil," said Guy Mickens, of Yonkers, as he pumped gas into his car in
Thornwood. "Just like I don't mind standing in the cold in this slush here."
</P>
<P>
	   All public schools in Rockland and Putnam counties were on delayed openings,
as well as most in Westchester and Long Island.
</P>
<P>
	   Public schools in the city and all three metropolitan area airports were
open today. LaGuardia Airport, closed for six hours on Tuesday, was opened but
all shuttle flights to Washington were cancelled due to weather problems in
Washington, which was also hit hard by the storm.
</P>
<P>
	   "It looks like we're starting to get back to normal," said Port Authority
spokesman Steve Coleman. But he advised travelers to check with airlines. Delays
were likely to occur throughout the day as the airlines try to accommodate
hoardes of passengers whose flights were cancelled on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm interrupted normal routines and plans of natives and tourists
alike.
</P>
<P>
	   Susan Dillon, 29, didn't get to complete her daily morning run in Central
Park. "My running shoes are no match for the snow. I was sliding and sliding,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tourist Faye Roberton, of Worthing, England, was surprised that the storm,
which was less intense in Manhattan than its outer boroughs and suburbs, forced
the closure of the Empire State observatory.
</P>
<P>
	   "We heard that in America you could do whatever you want whenever you want,
so we're rather disappointed," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   But for 16-year-old Jamaire Elegant, of New Rochelle, it was a day to play.

<HEADLINE> Ark. Air Crash Transcript Released  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID A. LIEB Assocaited Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Rocked by high winds on their approach to Little
Rock, two American Airlines pilots realized their jet was ``way off'' course
just moments before it crashed, broke up and caught fire.
</P>
<P>
	   A transcript of American Airlines Flight 1420's cockpit voice recorder was
released today in advance of a National Transportation Safety Board hearing on
the June 1 crash. Eleven people were killed in the accident and 89 were injured.
</P>
<P>
	   As ominous clouds rolled toward the airport from the northwest with heavy
rain, wind and hail, the plane made a ``bowling alley'' approach from the
southwest, according to previously released control tower tapes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going right into this crap,'' co-pilot Michael Origel said to Capt.
Richard Buschmann as the plane approached the airport. Buschmann, who died in
the crash, had complained seconds earlier about making a visual approach to the
airport in bad weather at night.
</P>
<P>
	   Passengers and their relatives met for about 30 minutes privately with NTSB
officials before the hearing began, previewing a video re-enactment of the
plane's descent and getting an overview of the process. More than 100 survivors
and relatives were at the hearing in a reserved area stocked with tissue boxes.
</P>
<P>
	   The hearing was expected to run through Friday. Origel was to be the first
witness called today.
</P>
<P>
	   Origel told investigators in interviews after the crash that he had
suggested aborting the landing. According to the documents released today, a
section of the tape that the NTSB investigators deemed inaudible is where Origel
says he made such a suggestion. The NTSB refused to revise the transcript to
insert the comment Origel says he made.
</P>
<P>
	   About a minute before landing, Buschmann complained: ``This is a can of
worms'' but continued toward the airport. When the plane was several hundred
feet from the runway, the pilot uttered an expletive and said, ``We're off
course.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're way off,'' Origel replied.
</P>
<P>
	   The co-pilot told NTSB investigators the plane landed with its main landing
gear to the right of the runway and the nose of the plane pointing to the left.
The jet went into a slide and ran off the north end of the runway, down an
embankment and nose-first into steel supports for the airport navigation system.
</P>
<P>
	   At its hearing, the NTSB will look at weather conditions, decision-making
and the plane's mechanical operations, among other things.
</P>
<P>
	   The crash was deadliest on U.S. soil in 1999, although 217 were killed in
the crash of an EgyptAir jet off the Massachusetts island of Nantucket on Oct.
31.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, the Federal Aviation Administration released a transcript of
conversations between the cockpit of Flight 1420 and the Little Rock air traffic
control tower that included repeated warnings about a strong thunderstorm and
high winds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have heavy rain on the airport. ... The visibility is less than a
mile,'' the tower informed the cockpit about three minutes before it was to have
touched down shortly before midnight. A minute later the tower gave a wind shear
alert. Wind shears -- sudden, dangerous shifts in wind speed and direction --
are considered major hazards to aircraft as they land or take off.
</P>
<P>
	   Passenger Arnold Bowden said he felt a strong northwest wind that moved the
plane just seconds before it landed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When I first felt the wind and we got hit by rain simultaneously, I said,
`I don't think he's going to make the runway! Get down!''' Bowden recalled
Tuesday. ``We grabbed our knees and bent forward.''
</P>
<P>
	   A summary of the NTSB's findings -- but no theories -- is to be released at
the end of the hearing. A final report on the crash, and its cause, isn't
expected until some time later.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 400 people were killed last year in aircraft accidents in the
United States, its territories and international waters, according to the NTSB.
</P>
<P>
	   Flight 1420's cockpit voice recording picks up with the plane about 100
miles southwest of Little Rock and the pilots noticing lightning in the
distance.
</P>
<P>
	   Previously released transcripts between the plane and the Little Rock
control tower described a break in the storms as a ``bowling alley'' through
which the pilots would try to reach the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Buschmann is heard on the cockpit recording saying, ``This is the bowling
alley right here'' shortly before beginning his descent.
</P>
<P>
	   But the pilots were still concerned about the storms. At several times, they
make references to getting to the airport ``as soon as we can,'' as Origel put
it.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no discussion between the pilots in the last 100 miles of the
flight about diverting to another airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Origel told an NTSB investigator that he ``felt a sense of urgency to land
at (Little Rock) because the weather was moving in.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was no discussion of delaying or diverting the landing,'' Origel
said, according to an NTSB report also released this morning.
</P>
<P>
	   Less than 10 minutes before touching down, Buschmann said he could not see
the airport, but then picked up a view of the runway later.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hate droning around visual at night in weather without ... having some
clue where I am,'' Buschmann said about five minutes before touchdown.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yeah, but, the longer we go out here, the...'' Origel said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yeah, I know,'' Buschmann responded.

<HEADLINE> Surplus Projections Draw Criticism  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee said today
the huge projected budget surplus should be used for debt reduction, new
spending and tax cuts. But he was cautious in describing just how far
Republicans should go in cutting taxes in this election year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whether we do it this year or reserve it for another year, it is
inconceivable to me that the American taxpayer doesn't deserve some of this
money,'' said the chairman, Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.
</P>
<P>
	   Domenici's remarks came as Dan Crippen, director of the Congressional Budget
Office, formally presented his agency's projections that federal surpluses could
total more than $1.9 trillion over the next decade, without counting Social
Security funds.
</P>
<P>
	   With Social Security's own surpluses, total budget surpluses for the 10
years ending in 2010 could total more than $4.2 trillion, the CBO said.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional Republicans have not decided how large their tax cut will be
this year, and some conservatives may want to make them as large as possible.
But Domenici's comments echoed those of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., who on Tuesday told reporters, regarding tax cuts, ``maybe we should
start on the conservative side and be prepared to come back and revisit it once
again'' next year.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans are hoping that in 2001 they will be dealing with a GOP
president.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, top Democrat on the Senate Budget
panel, said he supports using parts of budget surpluses for modest tax cuts and
creating a prescription drug benefit under Medicare. But he said the surplus
projection was overblown because it assumes spending cuts that will not occur,
and added that debt reduction should be a priority when dividing any surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have huge unfunded liabilities in the future, when the baby boomers
will retire,'' said Lautenberg. ``The best way to prepare for that future is to
pay down our debt.''
</P>
<P>
	   The new projections could boost lawmakers' hopes for election-year tax cuts
and spending increases. The estimate virtually doubles the agency's last
estimate in July.
</P>
<P>
	   Crippen said the estimates were based on ``the mid-range of possible
outcomes'' for economic and budgetary performance, and conceded actual surpluses
``could be considerably different from those projections.''
</P>
<P>
	   At least for now, the impact of the new figures is chiefly political. The
new figures are good news for leading GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   He has proposed a five-year, $483 billion tax cut that could be paid for
with the surplus. Some, including candidate Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., have said
Bush's plan eats up too much of the projected surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans cited the new projections to claim they lived up to their pledge
last fall not to use Social Security surpluses for other programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Though final figures for fiscal 2000 won't be known until after the year
ends on Sept. 30, CBO projected that there will be a $23 billion surplus this
year without using Social Security's own hefty surpluses. The projected $1.9
trillion surplus, for the decade ending 2010, also excludes Social Security
funds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Republicans are right. They did not spend any money that belongs to
Social Security,'' said Domenici.
</P>
<P>
	   But Democrats complained that the CBO projection unrealistically assumes
that a large portion of federal spending will either be frozen at this year's
levels, or cut.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Democrats support a CBO $838 billion, 10-year surplus projection that
assumes spending will grow every year along with inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Before we get swept away by these projections, we have to closely examine
the premises,'' said Rep. John Spratt of South Carolina, top Democrat on the
House Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of likely political gridlock over many tax and spending proposals
this year, many analysts expect most of the surplus for fiscal 2001 -- which
begins next Oct. 1 -- to go for debt reduction. CBO projected next year's
surplus at up to $69 billion, plus $166 billion in Social Security surpluses.
</P>
<P>
	   But Spratt conceded that the new figures will ``raise everyone's
expectations as to what's possible'' because of the sheer amount of cash.
</P>
<P>
	   With the soaring economy pouring billions in unforeseen revenue into federal
coffers, President Clinton said he will propose paying off the government's
entire $3.6 trillion federally held debt by 2013. That would be two years
earlier than he has previously aimed for, and puts him a step ahead of House
Republicans, who are working on a plan to pay off that portion of the debt by
2015.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I ask the Republican majority in Congress to put politics aside and join
me,'' he said at the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton provided no details about how he would eliminate the publicly held
debt, which is money the government owes investors who hold Treasury bonds,
bills and notes. The remaining $2 trillion of the $5.7 trillion national debt is
money held by the Social Security and other trust funds.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said his plan, to be included in the fiscal 2001 budget he releases
Feb. 7, will devote interest savings to Social Security, extending its solvency
beyond 2050. It will also seek to ensure Medicare's survival until at least
2025, he said.

<HEADLINE> Energy Secretary Mulls Fuel Prices  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- While concerned about oil prices, Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson says the government's emergency reserves should not be used to
influence the market, and he has no intention to make such oil available.
</P>
<P>
	   But Richardson in a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press, said
he is meeting with a number of oil ministers from leading producing nations in
the weeks ahead to discuss the high prices in hopes of persuading them to expand
production.
</P>
<P>
	   Seeing oil prices dip below $12 a barrel a year ago, the producers belonging
to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries last March agreed to reduce
production by 4.3 million barrels a day. The limits have stuck and current oil
prices are nudging toward $30 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said he plans to meet separately with the oil ministers of Saudi
Arabia, Mexico and Venezuela, and possibly other countries. The OPEC nations are
scheduled to meet in March to decide whether to continue production limits.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the White House put in motion plans to increase federal
assistance to help low-income families pay for their heating oil, which over the
past week has soared in price. The Northeast, especially New England, is
particularly affected because of the region's heavy reliance on oil for heating.
</P>
<P>
	   The additional funds ``will help keep more families safe and warm this
winter,'' President Clinton said, announcing that he was directing the
Department of Health and Human Services to make the money available ``just as
quickly as we possibly can.''
</P>
<P>
	   The White House said $45 million would be provided to 11 states from
Pennsylvania to Maine as well as Alaska. The move came as a blizzard moved
through the Northeast and a week before the critical presidential primary in New
Hampshire, where heating oil prices are of considerable importance.
</P>
<P>
	   In his interview with the AP, Richardson touched on a number of topics,
including his future political aspirations, the changing electricity industry
and improved security at nuclear weapons research labs.
</P>
<P>
	   On oil prices, he said the administration was concerned, but that ``the
market should dictate prices'' and not ``any manipulative mechanisms.'' He said
he would not direct oil to be withdrawn from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in
an attempt to influence prices.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those (stocks) are used for emergencies,'' he insisted. The reserve, which
holds about 560 million barrels of oil, or enough to replace 62 days of imports,
was created to counter interruptions in oil supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   On other topics, Richardson said:
</P>
<P>
	   --After many years as a member of Congress, he now prefers an
``executive-type position.'' Richardson, who is Hispanic, has been mentioned as
a possible running mate for Al Gore, should Gore win the Democratic presidential
nomination. He also has shown an interest in running for governor in his home
state of New Mexico, and has not ruled out a senior position in a Gore
administration.
</P>
<P>
	   --Security at federal nuclear weapons laboratories has improved dramatically
over the past year since the firing of a scientist at the Los Alamos lab put the
spotlight on the potential for espionage.
</P>
<P>
	   --There is a possibility of summer power outages because of problems in the
power grids stemming from the electricity industry's shift from local monopolies
to competition. He urged Congress to pass an industry restructuring bill that
addresses reliability improvements.
</P>
<P>
	   --He's worried about the loss of scientists at federal research labs and
hopes a balance between security and academic freedom will ease a potential
``brain drain.''
</P>
<P>
	   When asked about his political aspirations, Richardson deflected questions
about a Gore-Richardson ticket. ``I don't want to limit the vice president's
flexibility. I just want to see him elected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Richardson, former congressman, former ambassador to the United Nations
and the highest ranking Hispanic in the Clinton administration, made clear he
has no intention of fading into obscurity after this year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm a political politician,'' said Richardson. ``I see myself running
again, either in New Mexico or whatever.''

<HEADLINE> On Stage: Jack Wagner on Broadway  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL KUCHWARA AP Drama Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Backstage at the Plymouth Theater, Jack Wagner is trying on
a wig, a wet mop of long dark locks that will transform him into kindly Dr.
Jekyll AND demonic Mr. Hyde, the two title characters he plays in the Broadway
musical "Jekyll &AMP; Hyde."
</P>
<P>
	   In its third year, the show has now opted for an actor with name recognition
to play its lead. Not that Wagner's two predecessors, Robert Cuccioli and his
replacement, Robert Evan, weren't fine.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet Wagner has impeccable pop icon credentials: "All I Need," a mid-1980s
Top 10 single. Heartthrob roles on a daytime soap opera, "General Hospital." The
nighttime sudser "Melrose Place."
</P>
<P>
	   The performer has the celebrity the musical's producers hope will translate
into increased ticket sales, the dream of every producer who has a long-running
show.
</P>
<P>
	   And nowhere does name recognition get a bigger boost than from television,
which may explain why a steady stream of TV stars make their way to Broadway and
onto the road in both musicals and plays.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the crop this season:
</P>
<P>
	   Susan Lucci, the Emmy (finally!) winning star of "All My Children," did a
highly publicized three-week replacement stint for Bernadette Peters in "Annie
Get Your Gun" over the Christmas and New Year's holidays.
</P>
<P>
	   Lucci's appearance while Peters' vacationed was masterminded by "Annie"
producers Fran and Barry Weissler, two of the savviest when it comes to finding
names to prolong the lives of their shows.
</P>
<P>
	   They extended the life of their 1994 revival of "Grease," parlaying the show
into a nearly four-year run, by trooping in everybody from former teen star
Maureen McCormick of "The Brady Bunch" to cult idol Lucy Lawless of "Xena:
Warrior Princess" to "All in the Family" regular Sally Struthers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Weisslers are doing it again with their even more successful "Chicago."
Such television regulars as Vicki Lewis ("NewsRadio"), Nana Visitor ("Star Trek
Deep Space Nine"), Marilu Henner ("Taxi"), Robert Urich ("Spenser: For Hire")
and Jasmine Guy ("A Different World") have appeared in various editions of the
musical.
</P>
<P>
	   Peppy talk-show princess Kathie Lee Gifford got favorable press, too,
replacing Carol Burnett each Tuesday in "Putting It Together," a revue of
Stephen Sondheim music that closes Feb. 20.
</P>
<P>
	   The game Gifford scored high marks, getting good reviews for singing some of
the musical theater's most difficult music. And it's not easy, making the
adjustment from tube to theater.
</P>
<P>
	   Says Wagner, "It was something I hadn't experienced because in television
and TV movies, you often don't get any direction. You are doing material so
quickly. In soap operas, you are taping 100 pages a day. And in nighttime
television, you are shooting about 60 pages in seven days.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have got to have it together. Hopefully, you are making the right
choices and your performance is acceptable."
</P>
<P>
	   Lucci began preparing around Labor Day for her Broadway engagement, working
with a vocal coach and John McDaniel, musical director of "Annie." The actress
hadn't been on stage in a musical in nearly a decade, but said her soap opera
work actually helped in the preparation.
</P>
<P>
	   "In one way, it is a lot like theater," she says. "We do 'All My Children'
'live on tape.' If we make a mistake, we just keep going. There has always been
a lot of discipline involved in my life. I have no trouble leaving one thing and
going on to something else. I am a quick study, although I know there is more to
a show that just the words."
</P>
<P>
	   There is the challenge. Wagner, who hasn't sung on stage since a 1992
production of "They're Playing Our Song" in California, jumped at the chance to
work with the director of "Jekyll &AMP; Hyde," Robin Phillips, former head of
Canada's Stratford Festival.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was one of the greatest experiences I've had as an actor," Wagner says
simply. "We spoke the same language. He used terms I understood completely.
</P>
<P>
	   "Now when you are given a play like this -- a period piece with a beginning,
a middle and an end, a play that is a Class A production, it makes you want to
bring the same thing to the performance."
</P>
<P>
	   "You need a name on the road" is the conventional wisdom that producers
follow unless they have "Cats," "The Phantom of the Opera" or "Les Miserables."
</P>
<P>
	   No wonder when "Art," winner of the 1998 best-play Tony, went out on tour,
the trek was led -- and still is -- by Judd Hirsch of "Taxi" fame. Or the
just-beginning journey of "The Civil War," a Broadway flop of last season,
alternates Nashville star Larry Gatlin and John Schneider of "Dukes of Hazzard"
fame in a leading role. And Richard Chamberlain has helped sell "The Sound of
Music" in the hinterlands, even though the part of Capt. Von Trapp doesn't
usually command center stage in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet producers stoutly maintain a name is not enough. The performer has to be
up to the demands of stage work, they insist. Take "Wit," winner of the 1999
Pulitzer Prize for drama. Not an easy play, but a tremendous role for an older
actress, one who has to play a college professor dying of ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   Judith Light, of "Who's the Boss?" and daytime's "One Life to Live," had the
television credentials, says Bernard Telsey, the casting director and one of the
producers of the off-Broadway hit. She also had the formidable stage technique.
</P>
<P>
	   "Judith is an actress grounded in emotion," Telsey explains. "She trained on
stage, She is not just surface. There is an amazing depth here, enough talent to
do this 'King Lear' of a role."
</P>
<P>
	   Light replaced the play's original star, Kathleen Chalfant, in New York,
before going out on the road. The trip takes her to Boston's Wilbur Theater in
February and the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., in March, the first stops
on a six-month tour.
</P>
<P>
	   Wagner has signed for a four-month run in "Jekyll &AMP; Hyde." Like Lucci, he
has upped his gym regimen, hoping to increase his endurance for playing what
basically are two roles at once.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's simply about stamina," Wagner says -- and learning how to flip the
wig. The flip has become one of the musical's signature moments, a neat
theatrical touch that quickly shows the actor changing from Jekyll to Hyde and
back again.
</P>
<P>
	   The wig, made of real hair, has to be freshly washed just before it goes on
in order to flip. "Otherwise, it won't move correctly, if it is dry," says wig
master Kevin Phillips.
</P>
<P>
	   "In order for the wig to work it has to be wet," he adds. "It goes back to
pure physics from high school. The centrifugal force of the wet hair and the
weight of that wig makes it pretty solid on his head."
</P>
<P>
	   And Wagner needn't worry about catching cold.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a nice warm theater and the show keeps him moving," Phillips says
-- drily.

<HEADLINE> Star Watch: Bette Midler  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUGLAS J. ROWE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bette Midler is feeling fluish and fatigued. Besides the
effects of the midwinter bug, she complains of suffering from sleep apnea.
</P>
<P>
	   Sickly and subdued, she's ever the show woman, though, and talks during an
interview as if she's feeling 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   By the end, she aptly says: "I just chattered and chattered and chattered."
</P>
<P>
	   She chatters about coveting fame as a kid but valuing artistry as an adult.
She chatters about why she took the role of pulp writer Jacqueline Susann in the
new biopic "Isn't She Great?" She chatters about fashion, both on screen and
off.
</P>
<P>
	   The black pants and blazer she wears this evening starkly contrast with the
eye-popping, brightly colored Pucci getups she wears in the movie -- which turn
out to be one of the reasons Midler took the part.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's glamorous, but it's not high glamour. It's a kind of a funky glamour,"
she says.
</P>
<P>
	   And it dates back to a time when glamour somehow seemed more important,
Midler says, citing a comment Susann once made.
</P>
<P>
	   "She herself said this: '1967 was the last year everything was all right.'
... It was the last year people dressed a certain way, where clothes really
mattered, and the whole society was well turned-out. After that, it was never
the same again," Midler says.
</P>
<P>
	   "She was right. And when you see pictures, films, documentaries of that
time, you see everyone in hats and everyone in gloves and everyone carrying a
bag and everyone in heels and everyone in nylons. It's really shocking. It's
shocking. And it's also quite beautiful, you know, to see such a display. Now
you don't see any display. It's all very rumpled."
</P>
<P>
	   One could suggest a lot of reasons for today's lack of glamour and elegance,
but the 54-year-old, bronze-haired Midler displays some of her trademark brass
by offering: "A lot of it is people who just want to be comfortable because
they're so fat. There's that too. Don't forget."
</P>
<P>
	   The brightly colored, busy-patterned Pucci stuff in "Isn't She Great?" is
refreshing, though admittedly hilarious, she says, "because when it was popular,
it was almost a gag.
</P>
<P>
	   "And when you look at it from so many years -- light years, actually -- away
from it, it takes on a glitter, a glamour that it didn't really have during its
real time. Do you know what I mean? When I was living in those years I always
thought, 'EEEuw, look at that! Uh! That's really ugly!' And now looking back,
you just see it in a whole different way."
</P>
<P>
	   You don't see op-art dresses anymore. After all, urban colors are black --
maybe navy blue, "and if you're really feeling lighthearted," adds Midler,
"gray."
</P>
<P>
	   All this comes from someone who Mr. Blackwell, that self-appointed arbiter
of bad taste, once described as dressing "like potluck at a rummage sale."
</P>
<P>
	   "Mr. Blackwell, he's still liv..., he's still around?" Midler catches
herself mid-sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   Annoyed at the recollection of Blackwell's comment, Midler says she saw him
recently on TV "dumping on some other poor slob."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's his fun thing. I didn't mind. It was considered a badge of honor and I
did have a lot of fun dressing up in those days."
</P>
<P>
	   Besides that dubious award from Blackwell, Midler has won four Grammys, two
Emmys (one for the memorable "Tonight" appearance on Johnny Carson's
next-to-last show) and a Tony. She's also received two Academy Award nominations
in a film career that's included several bombs as well as such hits as "Down and
Out in Beverly Hills," "Ruthless People" and "The First Wives Club."
</P>
<P>
	   On New Year's Day, she completed her 31-city "Divine Miss Millennium Tour"
in Las Vegas, and now she's playing Susann, the writer of such mega-best-selling
potboilers in the late 1960s and early 1970s as "Valley of the Dolls," "The Love
Machine" and "Once Is Not Enough."
</P>
<P>
	   Midler says she liked Susann's "nerve" -- as in when people used to say,
"You've got some NERVE!"
</P>
<P>
	   "I admired her will, her life force, which simply wouldn't take no for an
answer," Midler says, adding that she could also relate to Susann wanting to be
famous for fame's sake. "She didn't want to die unknown. Which is, in a funny
way, a very primitive and primal motivation."
</P>
<P>
	   She couldn't act, sing or dance. "But it didn't get in her way," Midler
says.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point in Paul Rudnick's funny script, someone tells Susann, "Talent
isn't everything."
</P>
<P>
	   Finally, her adoring husband (played by Nathan Lane) sees someone reading
Harold Robbins' "The Carpetbaggers" in Central Park and rushes home and urges
her to write.
</P>
<P>
	   "All I know about are aging stars, hopeful hookers and people popping pills
and winding up in the gutter," Susann responds. "And nobody writes books like
that."
</P>
<P>
	   Then she did -- and got the "mass love" she craved.
</P>
<P>
	   Midler can understand Susann's motivation because, as a little girl, Midler
would sing for her mother and daydream about being famous.
</P>
<P>
	   "I always wanted to be a big star, even before I knew what being a big star
was. And I have to admit I really wanted to be famous before I knew what it
meant. I didn't get it at all. I was in the middle of the Pacific Ocean," says
Midler, who was born and reared in Hawaii as part of the only Jewish family in
the neighborhood. "I had no clue. There was something glittering in front of my
eyes, and I wanted to be part of that glitter."
</P>
<P>
	   After working in a pineapple factory in her home state, she moved to New
York City, got a role in "Fiddler on the Roof," then landed her now legendary
gig singing in lower Manhattan's Continental Baths, a gay bathhouse, with Barry
Manilow as her pianist. She then signed with Atlantic Records in 1971, released
her debut album and earned a national reputation with her high-energy concerts,
hit records and recurrent appearances on Carson's show.
</P>
<P>
	   But while grabbing the glamour and the glory, "I really got into the more
studious aspect of it, the musical aspect, the idea that music was an art. ...
The joy that you really get out of life is the song that's well-sung or being
part of a musical experience that's really well-done and it's moving and
transcendent for an audience."
</P>
<P>
	   So it's the work and the art that moves her now, says Midler, who in 1984
married Martin von Haselberg, a commodities trader who works in performance art
as Harry Kipper. Their daughter, Sophie, is in her early teens.
</P>
<P>
	   "The rest is garbage. It's fool's gold. But you don't know that when you're
a kid. All you know is that you don't want to be unknown."
</P>
<P>
	   And, anyway, what's so great about fame, she wonders now.
</P>
<P>
	   "You look around, all these billions of people on this planet, and some of
them are perfectly happy. And nobody knows their name. And they're perfectly
happy. They eat great food. They listen to wonderful music. They have great
families. They experience nature. They have God. They have all this stuff in
their lives, and they don't even think about that thing that was glittering in
front of you, because they never had it glittering in front of them.
</P>
<P>
	   "So who's to say I'm any better off than they are? I just got trapped in a
dream. And they didn't but they're living, and they're happy. And they just have
just as much joy in their lives as I do in mine, probably more."

<HEADLINE> Errol Morris Takes On Mr. Death  </HEADLINE>
    By ERICA NOONAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Filmmaker Errol Morris isn't afraid viewers will be
disturbed by his latest documentary about a man who repairs electric chairs and
believes the Holocaust was a fraud.
</P>
<P>
	   He's more concerned that moviegoers won't be provoked by "Mr. Death: The
Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter Jr."
</P>
<P>
	   Morris, who directed other unconventional films like "The Thin Blue Line"
and "Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control," has turned his lens on Leuchter, a
Massachusetts death-penalty equipment engineer whose eyes light up at the
mention of electric chairs and gas chambers.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout the 90-minute film -- mostly shot in bleak shadows -- viewers
follow Leuchter into a bizarre world of neo-Nazism and Holocaust denial as he
tries, and fails, to prove gas chambers at the Auschwitz concentration camp were
fakes.
</P>
<P>
	   Leuchter himself is the chief narrator, looking straight at the camera
nearly the entire time.
</P>
<P>
	   "I like that this movie puts people in this odd place," Morris said during a
recent interview in his offices above Central Square. "It works if it makes you
think."
</P>
<P>
	   Morris' interest in Leuchter dates back more than a decade, when the
eccentric engineer was asked by Canadian neo-Nazi Ernst Zundel to conduct a
forensic investigation to prove cyanide gas was not used at Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
	   Zundel -- on trial in Canada at the time for publishing Holocaust denial
literature -- thought such a report would help his case.
</P>
<P>
	   Leuchter obliged and headed to Poland with his brand-new wife -- a waitress
from a doughnut shop he frequented -- to chisel cement from the walls of an
Auschwitz gas chamber.
</P>
<P>
	   The film footage of the gas chamber desecration, commissioned by Zundel, is
included in "Mr. Death." The scene in which Leuchter takes a hammer to the
historical shrine where tens of thousands of people were murdered by Nazis is
disturbing.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was the most bizarre home video ever made," Morris said.
</P>
<P>
	   After the trip, Leuchter sent the cement chips to a lab for testing. When no
traces of poison gas were found, he proclaimed the chamber a fake.
</P>
<P>
	   His assertions became "The Leuchter Report," which was widely distributed by
neo-Nazi groups as Holocaust denial propaganda. Mainstream critics and Jewish
advocates fired back, and the negative publicity took its toll: Officials in
death penalty states stopped asking Leuchter to maintain their equipment, and
his marriage unraveled.
</P>
<P>
	   The movie notes that Leuchter's tests were fundamentally flawed: The chemist
who tested the cement chips explains that not only would cyanide gas not
necessarily leave a traceable residue, but the building Leuchter sampled may not
have been the original gas chamber.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1992, Morris contacted Leuchter, who agreed to be interviewed. When they
met, Morris said, he set up the camera and hoped for the best.
</P>
<P>
	   As it turned out, Leuchter just "talked, and talked, and talked," Morris
said. "It was amazing."
</P>
<P>
	   It took more than five years for the film to receive funding from the
Independent Film Channel, and distribution from Lions Gate Films, but Morris
said he knew the whole time that the interview were special.
</P>
<P>
	   "I love to listen to how people express themselves as a way of entering
inside their heads," he said. "With Fred, we see the internal story -- the
mental landscape."
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the inflammatory nature of "Mr. Death," its maker says the film is
not so much about Holocaust denial, but the life path of an odd man.
</P>
<P>
	   Morris, who at age 51 has logged more than two decades in the filmmaking
business, is pleasantly odd himself. His local production company, Fourth Floor
Productions, is ensconced on the fifth floor of an office building overlooking a
ragged corner of Cambridge. A little joke, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A native New Yorker who now lives here with his wife and son, Morris first
emerged as a quirky, even eccentric, filmmaking force with his 1978 documentary
about pet cemeteries, "Gates of Heaven." He continued polishing his elegant and
penetrating interview style in 1981 with "Vernon, Florida," a film focusing on
the residents of a Southern swamp town.
</P>
<P>
	   But Morris is probably best known for his 1988 critically acclaimed "The
Thin Blue Line," about a man wrongly imprisoned for murder in Texas, and the
arrogance of police and prosecutors who allowed the injustice to happen.
</P>
<P>
	   Central to his work is the on-screen connection between subject and viewer.
</P>
<P>
	   "I like the idea that people can connect to other people on the screen in a
way they never expected to," he said. "With Fred it's disarming. You feel like
he's talking to you."
</P>
<P>
	   Over the years, Morris has learned to draw out his subjects with a device
called an Interotron, a video imaging device that gives interviewees the sense
they are talking directly to Morris as they stare into the camera.
</P>
<P>
	   Before coming up with the contraption a few years ago, Morris would put his
head next to the lens to draw out the most compelling and intense levels of eye
contact from his subjects.
</P>
<P>
	   The Interotron helped capture Leuchter's essence, conveying the serious and
political edge he had hoped for, Morris said.
</P>
<P>
	   Morris said he targeted the duel controversial subjects of the death penalty
and Holocaust in "Mr. Death" as a way to force viewers to consider their own
moral blind spots.
</P>
<P>
	   "The question is: Can he be this stupid? Or can we be like him?" Morris
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Leuchter did not respond to several messages left at his Malden home seeking
comment on the movie.
</P>
<P>
	   "Mr. Death" was a hit at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival and opened recently
in New York, Boston and other cities nationwide. It's already being touted by
critics and movie writers as a possible Academy Award contender, and the film is
generating plenty of prerelease buzz, thrusting the filmmaker whose movies are
mostly shown at art house theaters, into the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
	   But mainstream -- with a twist -- is fine by Morris, who says his next
project is a series of half-hour interviews with people both real and obscure
for the Bravo television network, called "First Person."
</P>
<P>
	   One segment focuses on Temple Grandin, a Colorado State University professor
who designs more humane slaughterhouses.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's one of my best pieces ever," Morris said. "Temple is such an
extraordinary character, such a moving story."
</P>
<P>
	   Another of his favorite segments is about Saul Kent, a cryogenics expert who
froze his mother's head. Its title? "I Dismember Mama," Morris said with a sly
smile.
</P>
<P>
	   Recently, a crew from "60 Minutes II" has been following him around for a
profile scheduled to air on national television in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Does the filmmaker known for interviews that expose and provoke mind being
on the other side of the camera for a change?
</P>
<P>
	   "Not at all," he said with a grin. "I don't have anything to hide."

<HEADLINE> Books and Authors: Art of the State  </HEADLINE>
    By TED ANTHONY AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Some images: Concrete pylons along the New Jersey Turnpike.
A patch of rolling Iowa countryside, rendered by Grant Wood. An adobe house in
rural New Mexico designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. A Don Ho album cover of
Hawaiian tunes.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosaic items, yes. Yet these are the building blocks of this country's
regionalism, the kinds of images that serve as touchstones for Americans
whenever new acquaintances ask the inevitable question: "Where are you from?"
</P>
<P>
	   This is the thinking behind "Art of the State," a series of palm-sized books
from Harry N. Abrams Publishers that undertakes the task of distilling each
American state down to its visual and spiritual icons -- and succeeds admirably.
</P>
<P>
	   "I always had such a sense of where I'm from," says Ruth Peltason, a
Midwesterner and the Abrams editor overseeing the series. "I felt these books
were an opportunity to re-establish that -- what's unique in all of us from the
states we're from. This was this attempt to say that come what may, our regional
identity is our strength."
</P>
<P>
	   So far, 15 states have been completed -- from Vermont to New Mexico, New
Jersey to Louisiana to California. Abrams aimed for a product that would be
straightforward enough to enchant a curious 12-year-old but retain sufficient
sophistication and depth to hold an adult's interest.
</P>
<P>
	   That's a daunting endeavor -- especially when it comes to avoiding
oversimplification, because the idea of "place" is a complex one.
</P>
<P>
	   It is geography, of course -- the bumps and dips of the land, the waters
that run through it. It is the men, the women and the children who populate it
over time and the grooves they carve to define their lives. It is also art --
the way the place's people appreciate it, render it and explore its meaning.
</P>
<P>
	   But art means more than painting and sculpture, though those are well
represented in the series, from famed artists like Grandma Moses and Georgia
O'Keeffe to Depression-era Works Progress Administration mural painters.
</P>
<P>
	   It also means quilts and record albums and postage stamps, line drawings and
souvenir plates and book covers and travel brochures -- anything that evokes or
depicts a unique corner of the state being explored.
</P>
<P>
	   This fits with the philosophy at Abrams, which specializes in lavish books
about art and photography. "We're taking art down from the museum wall and
saying, 'It's part of our world,"' Peltason says.
</P>
<P>
	   She seems the perfect choice to spearhead the series; her exuberance over
the topic is evident, even physically: Every time she makes a point about one of
the states, she bounds over to her office bookshelf to demonstrate it visually.
</P>
<P>
	   A St. Louis native, Peltason read Time-Life books growing up and became
enchanted with American regionalism. Now, she says, she realizes the role
regionalism plays in the way people interact.
</P>
<P>
	   When the first book in the series, about Iowa, was published, Peltason
recalls talking to a reporter there who wasn't very forthcoming at first. After
all, she reminds, the suspicion of "New York City" can run deep. "But soon as I
said I was a Midwesterner, she felt like she could relate to me."
</P>
<P>
	   The books themselves are captivating -- well-crafted, engrossing and awash
in color. Historical societies and museums in each state were asked for their
input, which shows. Each volume has text by a writer from the state it
chronicles, and each is filled with sidebars -- timelines, calendars of annual
events, mini-biographies of famous people -- that augment the imagery. Even
regional recipes are included.
</P>
<P>
	   "My way of understanding regionalism is through food," Peltason says. "I go
to Philly and want a cheesesteak. A skier would look at it in terms of mountain
ranges. A fisherman would look at it in terms of kinds of fish. We all express
regionalism in different ways." In short, each volume is a catchall -- a
miniature, mixed-media almanac that speaks to roots and community and geography.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's part of the human character to want to understand people's
roots," Peltason says. "You have a national identity, then you bring it into
your state, your city, your neighborhood, your family. It's like a pyramid -- a
quest for your roots."
</P>
<P>
	   Abrams plans to issue books on all 50 states in the next couple years. Each
will carry the same implicit message that the current ones do: That despite the
rise of a national culture, America is not being homogenized. It retains its
regional character, which in turn infuses people with a crucial part of their
identities.
</P>
<P>
	   "People have been asking each other since they came to this country: 'Where
are you from?' They're still asking," Peltason says, picking up one of the
books. "I want to say to someone, 'You want to understand me? Here."'
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   "Art of the State" ($12.95, Harry N. Abrams), available for 15 states;
others upcoming.

<HEADLINE> Jessye Norman: A Musical Hard-Sell  </HEADLINE>
    By VERENA DOBNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- She's the diva of Girl Scout cookies.
</P>
<P>
	   Opera star Jessye Norman sold more than 2,000 boxes in the past year -- "My
best year ever," she says.
</P>
<P>
	   "I get the chipmunk and the stuffed bear and the patch and everything --
just like the 10-year-olds," says the 54-year-old soprano about her sideline
from "that night job," her career as a concert artist.
</P>
<P>
	   "I will sell cookies to anybody, anywhere, on the street, to people out of
the back of my car." But unlike other cookie sellers, her car has a chauffeur
and she's an honorary lifetime Girl Scout attached to a troupe in Paris.
</P>
<P>
	   Nothing odd about that. After all, the Georgia-born singer first became a
musical icon in France. Her following was so over-the-top that Jean-Jacques
Beineix's 1982 film, "Diva," starring Wilhelmenia Wiggins Fernandez, was based
on one of Miss Norman's obsessive admirers, who planned his life around her
concerts.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, her first solo recording in three years is of French music and --
surprise! -- it's not classical.
</P>
<P>
	   "I Was Born in Love With You" is an album of cabaret songs by the
Grammy-award winning songwriter Michel Legrand, to be released Feb. 8. It's a
sexy switch from the formidable operatic heroines that won Miss Norman fame.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm dying of love from beginning to end of the album, which is just fine,"
says the newly minted chanteuse, releasing a peal of laughter that erupts like
Niagara Falls.
</P>
<P>
	   On Valentine's Day, she's bringing the songs to Studio 54 for a show
benefiting God's Love We Deliver, which delivers free meals to homebound people
with AIDS. It's one of dozens of charities to which she volunteers her time.
</P>
<P>
	   "The love of one's community, and the love that we need to put into that to
make it all a bit better, is something that I'd like us to focus on this first
Valentine's Day of the new century," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Offering love to strangers doesn't quite fit Miss Norman's cliched public
image -- that of a bigger-than-life star, ready to dazzle. That's who viewers
saw on worldwide television in 1989, singing for the bicentennial of the French
Revolution, standing by the Arc de Triomphe draped in the "tricolor" flag, and
again in 1996 at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, Ga., and in 1997 for President
Clinton's inaugural.
</P>
<P>
	   Those were media spectacles that featured a public figure full of control
and elegance in both dress and bearing, a woman whose voice was an opulent force
of nature. But during a recent interview in a Manhattan hotel suite, a far more
down-to-Earth, even vulnerable, individual emerged.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wouldn't like to completely disillusion people who think I wear a tiara
all day," Miss Norman jokes. She sits quietly on a sofa, occasionally wringing
her hands as she ponders aspects of her life.
</P>
<P>
	   "What IS a diva, anyway?" she asks suddenly, backing the question with her
disarming style -- a simple black dress, short manicure and no eye-popping
jewels.
</P>
<P>
	   She often putters around her suburban home in Westchester County in
sweatshirts and baggy pants. "Sometimes I look down and say, 'Did I get dressed
today, or what?"'
</P>
<P>
	   And this is one star who doesn't do her hair every day. "Oh no! You'd be
shocked."
</P>
<P>
	   To fans, however, she is a diva in the true sense of the word's Italian
meaning, which describes an ancient goddess praising Achilles in Homer's
"Iliad."
</P>
<P>
	   For decades, Miss Norman has vocally personified the doomed characters
created by composers like Wagner, Berlioz and Strauss, prompting the Washington
Post to dub her "a virtual incarnation of the mask of tragedy."
</P>
<P>
	   Her vocal outpouring has been accompanied by the world's leading orchestras,
and she's filled concert halls with art songs and churches with gospel music.
She was soloist with the Chicago Symphony for Bela Bartok's "Bluebeard's
Castle," which won a Grammy in 1998 for best opera recording. But for now, she's
into jazz and cabaret -- and she likes it that way.
</P>
<P>
	   "Someone might get up in the middle of the song and that's just sort of the
way it goes. It's a different format," she says of her upcoming Studio 54
appearance. Besides, being nearsighted, she's closer to the audience, "and I can
see them."
</P>
<P>
	   In March, she's up for a series of U.S. recitals starting at Carnegie Hall,
where she is to premiere a piece by composer Judith Weir, with texts by Toni
Morrison, Maya Angelou and Clarissa Pinkola Estes.
</P>
<P>
	   But whether in a concert hall or a cabaret, Miss Norman can't seem to get
far from one thing: "I'm dying always!"
</P>
<P>
	   There's another constant: "It's the same vocal chords. The change takes
place here," she says, pointing to her head. "Singing happens very much in the
mind, as well as in the rest of the body."
</P>
<P>
	   Miss Norman wraps her rich voice around the English language with
ever-varying inflections, depending on where she's been living most recently.
</P>
<P>
	   "I sound like a Southern girl who's spent many, many years working in
Europe, who's lived in Germany. So ... that's a mess!" she says with a hearty
laugh. "I'm all of that. It confuses people; they say, 'Where do you come
from?"'
</P>
<P>
	   Actually, she's very much at home in Paris, where nobody addresses her by
her last name, she says.
</P>
<P>
	   "I love it if I'm walking through the Gare de Lyon (a Paris train station),
and somebody who's in charge of the luggage says, 'Bonjour, Jessye!"'
(pronounced "Zhecee").
</P>
<P>
	   Over the years, she has gained such a following that the makers of "Diva"
modeled the movie's obsessive fan after a Paris messenger who would travel all
over Europe, by third-class train when available, to hear Miss Norman. He died
more than five years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was one of these people that one thinks about on a concert day when,
really, you're not quite sure how you're going to be able to get out of bed,
much less perform, one is feeling so unwell," she says. "But one thinks that,
'Alain is going to be there,' so I'm going to make an effort."
</P>
<P>
	   He would almost never come backstage, she says, but "he was very important
to me. ... He would come to the foot of the stage and either say hello, or let
me know that he was there, or hand me up some flowers."
</P>
<P>
	   Miss Norman has a passion for flowers -- orchids, in particular. One is
named after her, and her management company is called L'Orchidee.
</P>
<P>
	   She has many other interests outside music, from making Chinese food to
reading the novels of Tolstoy. But her biggest passion is medicine; becoming a
doctor had been her dream while she was growing up in Augusta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm sure that I dispense as much medical advice as most people who get paid
for it -- to my friends," she says proudly. "And they know to ignore me
completely!"
</P>
<P>
	   But does she really know anything about medicine? "Of COURSE I do, I don't
make it up!" she exclaims. She has a hobby known to few opera singers: reading
the Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
	   And then there are the Girl Scout cookies.
</P>
<P>
	   It's not exactly door-to-door sales, but she has her sales pitch down cold.
</P>
<P>
	   During dinner at one of Manhattan's great private clubs, "there's a lull in
the conversation," Miss Norman explains. "And I say, 'Well, you KNOW, it's Girl
Scout cookie time. I bet you've been dreaming about some of these Thin Mints.
Here I am.' "

<HEADLINE> Precious Time: Tea With V.S. Naipaul  </HEADLINE>
    By HILLEL ITALIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Kensington. Tea time. A slick, spacious hotel lounge. Sir
Vidiadhar Surajprasad Naipaul arrives right at the appointed hour, wearing an
Italian felt hat, designer glasses and a green corduroy jacket. A monogrammed
briefcase under his arm, he moves purposefully across the near-empty room and
approaches a corner table.
</P>
<P>
	   "How long is this going to be? Tell me, how many words do you need for your
piece?" he asks in the richest of British accents, placing his briefcase on an
empty chair and setting his hat and glasses on top. "I ask so I can pitch my
answers at a proper length."
</P>
<P>
	   V.S. Naipaul has no masters to obey or further commitments to honor; he
answers only to himself. The 67-year-old author tires easily and one reason he
rarely gives interviews is that they consume as much energy as writing itself.
At his age, Naipaul considers energy a finite commodity.
</P>
<P>
	   Author of more than 20 books, including such celebrated novels as "A House
for Mr. Biswas" and "A Bend in the River," Naipaul has had an exhausting
literary career. In both fiction and nonfiction, he has written about his
travels in India, Africa, Iran and elsewhere, differentiating between how these
places have been imagined by others and how he sees them.
</P>
<P>
	   "I really do see him as continuing the tradition of Joseph Conrad, writing
about the decline of empire and the effects of empire," said author Robert
Stone, whose novels have been set everywhere from the Middle East ("Damascus
Gate") to Central America ("A Flag for Sunrise").
</P>
<P>
	   "He's one of the very best, without question," added the novelist and nature
writer Peter Matthiessen. "What he writes is very clear, very intelligent, very
tough-minded."
</P>
<P>
	   Naipaul also carries the reputation of being a tough-minded, misanthropic
man. He does not engage in such literary rituals as publishing parties and
scribbling blurbs for the works of peers. In "Sir Vidia's Shadow," a highly
unflattering book published in 1998, former friend Paul Theroux wrote that "he
elevated crankishness as the proof of his artistic temperament."
</P>
<P>
	   But on this cool afternoon at Millennium Bailey's hotel, the sun edging in
and out of the clouds, Naipaul is an amiable, accomplished conversationalist.
Sharing a pot of tea, he answers all questions directly, at proper length, and
will ask upon completion if he's given an adequate response. While listening, he
will often nod his head and utter, like a chant, the word "Yes." Yes. Yes Yes.
Yes Yes.
</P>
<P>
	   Naipaul possesses one of literature's most distinctive faces. His expression
is tense, focused, accented by a graying beard and dark, leonine hair, brushed
back and slightly scruffy at the neck. His eyes are small and so narrow that
they appear set in a permanent squint.
</P>
<P>
	   Squint back and you'll spot a tiny scar above his right eye, left from a
childhood argument with his father. The family was in a terrible way at the
time, short of food and shorter in temper, living far from town on an estate
with the father's in-laws.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't see my father for days. His nerves deteriorated," the author
recalled in "Finding the Centre," a memoir.
</P>
<P>
	   "He had been given one of the servant rooms (we children slept anywhere). In
that room one Sunday evening, in a great rage, he threw a glass of hot milk. It
cut me above my right eye."
</P>
<P>
	   The scar, Naipaul says, is literally only skin deep. Inside, he is marked by
far happier memories. He reveres his father, himself a journalist and author who
became the model for the ever-striving title character of "Mr. Biswas." When
Seepersad Naipaul died, in 1953, his young son sent a cable from England that
called him "THE BEST MAN I KNEW."
</P>
<P>
	   "I still feel that way," said Naipaul, a native of Trinidad who has lived in
England since 1950 and shares homes in London and in the west England
countryside with his second wife, Nadira. The author has no children.
</P>
<P>
	   Naipaul left Trinidad when he was 17 on a scholarship to study at Oxford,
and he and his father corresponded by mail. Those letters, along with some
Naipaul wrote to other family members, are included in the recent publication
"Between Father and Son."
</P>
<P>
	   The idea for the book came during a conversation with Bill Buford, literary
and fiction editor for The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
	   "I saw Vidia for lunch in 1995 and one of the things I was hoping to get his
blessing for was to publish, ironically enough, the correspondence between him
and Paul Theroux. Paul Theroux remembered those letters as being lessons on how
to be a writer," Buford said.
</P>
<P>
	   "And suddenly the proverbial light bulb appeared above his head and his face
lit up and he explained, with a long, ecstatic, 'Ah!' He said the letters I
really wanted are between him and his father. He said those were the letters
that taught him how to be a writer and how to be a man."
</P>
<P>
	   Writing tends to be a democratic, rather than dynastic affair, with great
writers often emerging from nonliterary homes and mere talent emerging from the
homes of genius. The reign of Shakespeare, for example, begins and ends with
William Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
	   But Naipaul's father was a gifted writer and an invaluable resource for his
son. His advice was wise ("Read Conrad for intensity of expression; but for the
most part be yourself") and his encouragement generous. In one letter, the elder
Naipaul makes an unusual suggestion.
</P>
<P>
	   "You see," he writes, "we have to work to plan: Either you support me after
you are through with Oxford, and let me devote myself wholly to writing the
things I want to write; or I support you so you devote yourself to the same
thing."
</P>
<P>
	   Seepersad Naipaul was born in Trinidad in 1906. As a young man he began
writing articles on the Indian community for the Trinidad Guardian, a local
paper where he worked off and on his entire life. He married Dropatie Capildeo,
who came from a family of landowners, and they had seven children. Like Mr.
Biswas, Seepersad moved his family from house to house as he dreamed of a
better, more stable life. He longed to have his own fiction published, but only
posthumously did that happen, when his son helped get "The Adventures of
Gurudeva" released in 1976.
</P>
<P>
	   "He had this belief in the life of the mind. He certainly didn't get it from
it his education. He certainly didn't get it from his friends," said V.S.
Naipaul, whose brother, the late Shiva Naipaul, also became a writer.
</P>
<P>
	   "If he had been born in another culture, not a colonial agricultural
society, his talent would have given him a reasonable chance somewhere and he
would have flourished. Part of his pathos was that he was born in the wrong
place."
</P>
<P>
	   The letters portray the young Naipaul as a lonely, headstrong man, given to
intense depression. He worries about money, minimizes his future ("expect
nothing great from me") and wonders how "people could ever put up with me." He
admits to such "aristocratic traits" as the enjoyment of fine hotels and says he
finds his peers at Oxford "quite insipid and their company tedious." One friend
tells him that he's disliked, "because I made them feel that I knew they were
fools."
</P>
<P>
	   By the time he graduates from Oxford, he has decided, "I shall die if I had
to spend the rest of my life in Trinidad." He believes he has reached "the end
of the hard road" and that he does indeed "have a little talent." Referring to
the English, he vows "to beat them at their own language."
</P>
<P>
	   Declining a second cup of tea, the author explains that he doesn't have
happy memories of that time and he didn't bother reading the letters. Naipaul
has a long history of dealing selectively with the outside world. He said he
hasn't read a review in decades and had no interest in the Theroux book. He also
has little to offer about contemporary fiction, saying it only gets in the way
of what really matters -- his own work.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't want to be corrupted by what I read. I don't wish to react. I wish
just to keep on doing my work," said Naipaul, whose West London flat is a short
drive from this hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   "Stendhal wrote an autobiography, and he said that his style was too blunt
in 'Le Rouge et le Noir' ('The Red and the Black'). He should have been writing
in another style, but he was reacting against (Rene de) Chateaubriand. And he
said that was very foolish of him to be writing like Chateaubriand because in
another 50 or 100 years who will care about Chateaubriand?"
</P>
<P>
	   Contradictions are a natural subject for storytellers and anyone telling
Naipaul's story should note some contradictions about him. He is averse to
disruption, but prides himself on being compulsively curious. He resents needing
years to acquire a readership, but later observes that good writers need time to
be appreciated. He documents the follies of ideologues, those who impose their
ideas of truth, yet Naipaul himself believes writers should do just that.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not a great fan of Proust, apart from his criticism, but he wrote
something I like," said Naipaul, whose favorite writers include Flaubert and
Balzac. "He believed that writers are like oculists. He means the old-fashioned
oculists, where they fit one lens and they say, 'How does it look now?' And they
fit another and another and eventually they take away their hands and you look
at the world and see it differently."
</P>
<P>
	   Illusion is one of Naipaul's major themes. He writes again and again of
knights-errant, Don Quixotes tilting at windmills all over the world. That has
meant rebels in Africa, clerics in Iran and explorers such as Sir Walter
Raleigh, who set sail for the New World and caused great bloodshed in search of
the nonexistent El Dorado.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you come from the New World, as I in large measure do, you see all the
absurd fantasies people have taken there and the troubles they have wrought as a
result," Naipaul said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were not given a proper history of the New World itself. This was not
out of wickedness. It was out of ignorance, out of indifference, out of the
feelings that the history of this very small island was not important. These
aspects one had to learn and writing took me there. One didn't begin with
knowledge. One wrote oneself into knowledge."
</P>
<P>
	   Naipaul has never written a full-length memoir, but anyone reading his books
can follow the evolution of his life. The folksy tone of such early novels as
"Miguel Street" and "The Suffrage of Elvira" gives way to the detached,
Anglicized language of "Mr. Biswas" and "The Mimic Men" and then to the
international angst of "Guerrillas" and "In a Free State."
</P>
<P>
	   "I was once part of the flow, never thinking of myself as a presence. Then I
looked in the mirror and decided to be free," thinks a character from "In a Free
State," an immigrant from India living in Washington, D.C. "All that my freedom
has brought me is the knowledge that I have a face and a body, that I must feed
the body and clothe this body for a certain number of years. Then it will be
over."
</P>
<P>
	   Naipaul's first novel, "The Mystic Masseur," came out in 1957. Serious
exploration began in the 1960s, when he wrote "An Area of Darkness," an
unsentimental (too unsentimental, some critics said) account of a long trip to
India, the country of his ancestors. His travels continued in "A Bend in the
River," based in East Africa, and in such nonfiction books as "Among the
Believers: An Islamic Journey," where he writes of Iran, Pakistan and other
countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Naipaul once wrote that while oppressors should be despised, the oppressed
were to be feared. In his books, revolutions -- and revolutionaries --
inevitably go wrong. They're the disastrous products of private fantasy, wrought
by those who can't differentiate between the "gold" of the mind and the "lead"
of reality.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know if politically I would agree with Naipaul," said Matthiessen,
who has written about such issues as farm workers in California and the
destruction of wildlife in Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   "But I get the sense that despite his hard exterior he has a lot of
compassion for people who are oppressed. We might not agree on what needs to be
done, but I think he understands what's going on." As a young man, Naipaul wrote
to his family, "The world is a pretty awful place, but our star will shine
bright yet." He now dismisses that language as "romantic" but holds on to the
sentiment. He still considers the world unfriendly, but he doesn't doubt his
place in it.
</P>
<P>
	   Naipaul's books suggest a journey that began in his native country and will
end in the author's mind. Recent works like "Finding the Centre" and the novel
"The Enigma of Arrival" are openly autobiographical, examining his own childhood
and the process of writing itself. He is as determined to find the truth about
himself as he has been about world history.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm rather surprised to discover in myself a great calm," he said. "That
has happened quite recently.
</P>
<P>
	   "At my age you can't panic too much because you're too close to the end.
When you are young you have no idea of the end and the world can seem
overwhelming, so you panic. But now I've been through it, more or less, so I
don't panic."
</P>
<P>
	   Naipaul rises and announces he must leave. He believes (correctly) that he
has said enough for the story, and, gathering his belongings, politely explains
that he needs to go home and rest. The pot of tea is still half full.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have given you a great deal," he says. "And this has taken a great deal
out of me."

<HEADLINE> Rock Beat: Mickey Hart  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN ROGERS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Even stacked up against 30 years of Grateful Dead
experiences, drummer Mickey Hart must concede that this has been one incredible
day.
</P>
<P>
	   "That was strange!" he says, exhaling deeply, a sheepish smile crossing a
face that at this moment could be mistaken for that of a graduate student who
has just been put through his oral boards by a particularly ferocious faculty.
</P>
<P>
	   In Hart's case, it's not school but television that has drained him. He has
just finished plugging his new book, "Spirit Into Sound: The Magic of Music," on
the "Roseanne" show.
</P>
<P>
	   "I hope that doesn't show in San Francisco," he blurts out more to himself
than to anyone else in the limousine that is returning him to his Hollywood
hotel room. He is worried about what the folks back home will think.
</P>
<P>
	   On the show, Roseanne, true to talk-show fashion, badgered Hart into
acknowledging that among other things he had sex with Janis Joplin in the 1960s,
hung out with Jimi Hendrix and took a whole lot of drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   But she also lavishly praised his new book, telling him that among the rock
music groups she has idolized over the years, the Grateful Dead stand front and
center. He's appreciative of her support and admiration. But then there was all
of that other stuff.
</P>
<P>
	   "First of all you don't talk about certain things," he says. "I don't talk
about making love to Janis. It was just a moment in time. I never forget it. But
I don't tell the story."
</P>
<P>
	   As for the Dead's once gargantuan -- and now legendary -- drug habits, he
acknowledges that he resents the continued harping on the subject.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't even smoke pot anymore," he says somewhat defensively. "The
strongest thing I take these days is a cup of coffee -- maybe two -- in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
	   "I did use it, it's part of my history," he says of LSD.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's really hard to explain it in a sound bite. And then the young kids get
the idea that, you know, it's like you're an advocate for it. And I don't want
to be an advocate for any kind of powerful drug."
</P>
<P>
	   But yes, Hart says, everyone in the band did drugs in the early days. As he
looks back on it now, he believes if they hadn't, they might not have produced
the ethereal, freeform music that seems to be standing the test of time.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet another critically praised Grateful Dead album has just hit the stores.
This one, a five-CD collection, is both a retrospective of the group that
disbanded after guitarist Jerry Garcia's death in 1995 and also a collection of
all new music; none of the tracks has been released on any other album.
</P>
<P>
	   But that's all part of the past now for Hart, who is married and the father
of grown children, as well as a firm believer in the healing power of music. It
was that belief, he says, that led him to become an author. "Spirit Into Sound,"
his third book this decade, follows "Planet Drum" and "Drumming on the Edge of
Magic."
</P>
<P>
	   In the first two, he sought to trace the creation of rhythmic sound from the
beginning of time and to show music's ability to change people.
</P>
<P>
	   His new book examines many of those same issues, but it lets other people do
most of the talking, collecting quotations from perhaps the most eclectic group
of thinkers assembled on the subject. Everyone from Garcia to Woody Guthrie to
Igor Stravinsky to the Ayatollah Khomeini gets a say.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, it appears at first glance less ambitious than his first two
works. But Hart insists that's hardly the case.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not just a stale quote book," he maintains. "It really gives the
nod to music as a cultural treasure and a sacred art.
</P>
<P>
	   "It ain't just about entertainment," he finally says, laughing, as he gives
up trying to explain music's mysterious grip on people.
</P>
<P>
	   For Hart, these past few years have also been about much more than
entertainment. He serves on the board of directors of the Library of Congress'
American Folklife Center. The group's ambitious goal: to digitally record
everything in the library's vaults and download it onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   And then there is his newfound passion for the written word.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm editor-in-chief of Grateful Dead Books, which we've just created," he
says.
</P>
<P>
	   "Spirit Into Sound" was the publishing house's first title. Its next project
will be a coffee-table art book featuring the work of Alton Kelley and Stanley
"Mouse" Miller, creators of most of the Grateful Dead's album-cover and poster
art. And after that, there's Hart's next work -- a book on how music affects the
brain.
</P>
<P>
	   He still tries to play the drums everyday, either at home with his family or
on the road with various Grateful Dead buddies.
</P>
<P>
	   At 56, his face has become deeply creased by decades of hard living, and his
once-dark hair is now salt-and-pepper. But he remains his youthful, peripatetic
self, and he scoffs at the suggestion that he might consider slowing down.
</P>
<P>
	   "Desperate man," he says, laughing again, as he explains his penchant for
nonstop work.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm desperate for that feeling," he continues. "I love that feeling of that
moment of creation. So I'll do anything for it. I'll even come to L.A. to do
book signings. Or go to Maine or New York on tour."
</P>
<P>
	   Or ... go on the "Roseanne" show and talk about Janis and those halcyon days
of rock 'n' roll.

<HEADLINE> McCain survives ballot challenges with help from Democrats  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Attempts by supporters of Gov. George W. Bush to
throw Sen. John McCain off New York's March 7 Republican presidential primary
ballot in eight congressional districts were thwarted today by helpful
Democrats.
<P>
	   Two Democrats on the four-member state Board of Elections refused to go
along with challenges to McCain's petitions in those districts.
</P>
<P>
	   In a partisan division, the two Republican commissioners voted to exclude
McCain's delegate slate petitions for those districts because he lacked enough
signatures from party members. But the two Democratic commissioners, Carol
Berman and Evelyn Aquila, refused to vote on the issue and abstained instead. It
would have taken three votes from the board to invalidate the petitions.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of the Texas governor could still go into state courts in an
attempt to have the petitions invalidated. Jeffrey Buley, who works for the
state Republican Committee in support of Bush, said today they would appeal the
decision. "We're getting ready to go in front of a judge," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before the vote there has been indications the Democratic commissioners
were ready to help McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are going to vote to leave him on the ballot," state Senate Minority
Leader Martin Connor, a New York City Democrat and top election law lawyer, had
told The New York Times for today's editions. "For a presidential campaign, we
ought to put all the legitimate candidates on the ballot."
</P>
<P>
	   The two Democratic commissioners,  commissioner Neil Kelleher had accused
them of prearranging the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   "We can only be responsible for our own actions," Berman said. "My
conscience is clear."
</P>
<P>
	   The two Democrats refused to talk to the media after the voting. "I think
the less said to the press, the better," Aquila said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was knocked off the ballot in three congressional districts this week
by local election officials after state Republicans challenged the signatures on
the Arizona senator's presidential petitions.
</P>
<P>
	   State Republican leaders, who support Bush's candidacy, had challenged
McCain's petitions in 16 of New York's 31 congressional districts, claiming he
failed to obtain the required number of signatures from party members.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain will not sue to overturn the dismissals for the South Bronx and
Suffolk County districts, McCain campaign lawyer Henry Berger said. However, any
other possible disqualification will be challenged, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, in the 12th Congressional District covering parts of Manhattan,
Brooklyn and Queens, McCain is only missing one signature. That signature was
disqualified because the signer put the wrong house number on the petition,
Berger said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are one short because of a technicality," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   That one will be challenged in court, Berger said.
</P>
<P>
	   With polls showing McCain running ahead of Bush in New Hampshire, the battle
over the New York primary ballot has taken on extra significance.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, GOP candidates must get a certain number of signatures from
party members to qualify for separate convention delegate slates in each of the
state's 31 congressional districts in which they wish to compete. In effect,
there are 31 separate GOP primaries in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Should the challenges be upheld by the state Board of Elections, and
possibly by state courts thereafter, McCain could be without convention delegate
slates in more than half of the state.
</P>
<P>
	   The board hopes to certify the New York primary ballot by Jan. 31, but court
challenges could delay the final primary ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has also sued to get on the New York primary ballot. McCain's lawsuit
will be heard in federal court in Brooklyn Friday at 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also faces some petition challenges of his own from publisher Steve
Forbes in six New York City congressional districts. "We are highly, highly
confident we will prevail," Buley said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 46.22; Nasdaq Down 39.56  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock markets were mixed today, with a handful of blue chip
stocks edging higher while a number of well-known technology companies fell on
profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
	   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
46.22 at 11,076.11.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 4.45 at 1,405.58, and the Nasdaq composite index was off 39.56 at 4,127.85.
</P>
<P>
	   "Overall, the market is going through a recovery after several down
sessions," said Ricky Harrington, a technical analyst with Wachovia Securities
in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Cellular phone chipmaker Qualcomm was down 20 1/2 at 128 1/2. Despite
beating analysts' earnings estimates by a penny, the company warned Tuesday that
sales may be off this quarter. Investors promptly punished the company, driving
the stock down nearly 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Computer maker Compaq fell 3 5/8 to 29 3/8, and software company EMC Corp
was down 8 13/16 to 111 3/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Some old line companies were faring better, such as Corning, up 5 at 156
1/4, and Merrill Lynch, up 4 3/16 at 84 7/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said investors were unlikely to push the markets forcefully in one
direction or another while awaiting comments from Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Alan Greenspan, who was scheduled to speak to a congressional committee about
the federal budget at 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors were once again trying to balance strong corporate profits with
the fear of higher interest rates, which could eventually cut into company
earnings. So traders were looking for signs from Greenspan of whether Federal
Reserve policy makers will raise interest rates again at their meeting next
week.
</P>
<P>
	   Another factor adding to investor caution was President Clinton's State of
the Union address, slated for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "These events could be positive or negative for the markets. It's still
uncertain," said Harrington.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 525 million shares.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index was up 1.33 at 522.92.

<HEADLINE> Designer Farhi Taking NYC by Storm  </HEADLINE>
    By CAROL DEEGAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- If fashion were a baseball game, Nicole Farhi's designer
preview for her spring 2000 women's collection would have been canceled because
of rain. But fashion is more show biz than sport, so the show went on.
</P>
<P>
	   Farhi is a household name in Britain. She is an eight-time nominee for the
British Fashion Awards. She won the British Classics Award in 1989 and the
Contemporary Collections Award in 1995, 1996 and 1997. Her minimalist clothes
and knitwear are worn by Nicole Kidman, Cate Blanchett and Dame Judi Dench.
</P>
<P>
	   Already a star of the London fashion scene, Farhi decided to test the waters
at New York Fashion Week this past September. Hurricane Floyd tried to spoil the
show, sending gusty winds and torrential rains into Manhattan and flooding city
streets.
</P>
<P>
	   But in New York, the fashion faithful are not easily daunted. They put on
their protective weather gear and waded through ankle-high water to the Altman
Building to see Farhi present her collection.
</P>
<P>
	   At the end of the show, taxis were lined up to ferry guests uptown to a
party at her new Nicole Farhi flagship store on 60th Street between Madison and
Fifth avenues, just a splash away from Barneys New York and Donna Karan's new
DKNY store.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a rain-drenched debut, but Farhi took it in stride. With fall 2000
designer previews scheduled for February, she is sitting high and dry in
Nicole's, the restaurant located on her store's lower level.
</P>
<P>
	   Farhi doesn't relish putting on a show. Alexander McQueen may launch his new
ballet skirt in a theatrical snowstorm inspired by Stephen King's novel "The
Shining," but Farhi admits theatricality isn't one of her strengths.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can do a production, but I don't know how to do a production, I'm just
doing clothes, I'm not doing art. I'd do something else if I want to do an art
show. It's tricky," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Farhi feels comfortable in her 20,000-square-foot store. It was designed by
Michael Gabellini, who has designed boutiques for Jil Sander and Giorgio Armani.
</P>
<P>
	   The store is located in a 1901 landmark structure that was home to the
legendary Copacabana nightclub. A glass-sided bridge at the entrance leads into
the top floor of the two-tiered space, where customers can browse among the
latest Farhi designs. Two staircases descend to the restaurant.

<P>
	   New York has been good to Farhi: Her designs are selling well and the
restaurant is getting good reviews. Lunch is always crowded.
</P>
<P>
	   The restaurant has taken on a celebrity of its own: It was the scene of a
recent launch party for the "Where to Wear" shopping guide by Jill Fairchild
Melhado, daughter of Fairchild Publications' John B. Fairchild, and Dina Clason,
who has worked at Tiffany &AMP; Co. and at Barneys New York.

the comment: "A Farhi design is about luxury fabrics, clean cuts and a
sophisticated ease."

<HEADLINE> Five Questions with Nicole Farhi  </HEADLINE>
    By CAROL DEEGAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- In the past two decades, Nicole Farhi has emerged as one of
Britain's leading designers. Her blend of easy but functional tailoring with
luxurious separates and stylish accessories has won her a loyal following.
</P>
<P>
	   Dame Judi Dench wore a long, gray organza dress and matching cardigan
designed by Farhi at the 1998 Academy Awards. Jeremy Northam ("The Winslow Boy,"
"Emma," "Amistad") and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio ("My Life So Far," "Scarface,
"The Color of Money") have been spotted on the red carpet wearing her designs.
</P>
<P>
	   Farhi grew up in Nice. She moved to Paris when she was 18 to study art. In
1973, she met businessman Stephen Marks, founder and owner of French Connection,
which owns the Nicole Farhi label. Farhi worked solely for French Connection
until 1984 and continued to design there until 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1989, Farhi began designing menswear, which now accounts for some 40
percent of her retail sales. ("I was already designing women's clothes that had
a masculine touch," she explained.) Softly tailored men's suits and separates
have made the collection one of Britain's strongest labels.
</P>
<P>
	   Her home collection, launched in 1998, includes antique pieces that she
collects from flea markets around the world. "My philosophy here is the same as
for my clothes," she explains. "These are things you can feel comfortable with;
beautiful objects that have a history."
</P>
<P>
	   Besides the New York flagship store on 60th Street, there are eight Nicole
Farhi stores in London. The collection is also available in department and
specialty stores in the United States, Europe, Japan and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
	   Farhi is married to playwright David Hare. The couple lives in London.
</P>
<P>
	   1. New York magazine has called you the British Donna Karan. Do you agree?
</P>
<P>
	   Farhi: I think it was written as an easy way for them to describe who I am
because in England, I'm the equivalent ... of the woman designer designing for
women and maybe with a similar approach, I don't know. I'm of the same
generation as her now; we've been in the business for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
	   2. How do you define your presence in the United States?
</P>
<P>
	   Farhi: I think our business in America is growing, and the stores, the
buyers are saying to us, 'It's such a shame you don't have a store here because
it will help our business as well if you had a presence in the States.' So, you
know, why not? ... I think we have a nice showroom here and are more established
here than we are in France, oddly enough, so we thought, 'Why not New York
next?'
</P>
<P>
	   3. Why create your own store?
</P>
<P>
	   Farhi: It's good for my ego as well as a designer to see my clothes here
because if I see them on a rack in a department store, I'm not proud.
</P>
<P>
	   4. And the New York restaurant?
</P>
<P>
	   Farhi: When we took one suite, which was 16,000 square feet, it was a very
large store, and I didn't want to have clothes on both levels, and I said to
Stephen (Marks), 'It's too boring, we're not going to have more clothes,' and I
think you lose the exclusivity to put too much of it everywhere. And he was
involved with The Hard Rock Cafe. He said, 'What do you think of opening a
restaurant?' And I thought, 'Well, that sounds quite fun,' and so we did, and
it's a very good restaurant.
</P>
<P>
	   5: Do you have a favorite among your menswear, womenswear and home
collections?
</P>
<P>
	   Farhi: I would have to say because it is my newest baby, the home collection
is really giving me a lot of satisfaction.

	   In the spotlight:
</P>
<P>
	   Christian Bale has his own way of keeping the competition at bay. "I don't
read entertainment magazines, they'd just make me insanely jealous," says Bale,
who was born on Jan. 30, 1974. Bale starred as Jesus in NBC-TV's "Mary Mother of
Jesus" and played a serial killer in "American Psycho." When asked the
difference between the two roles, he answered: "I had more nightmares playing
Jesus."
</P>
<P>
	   At 16, Gene Hackman ran off, joined the Marines, rode out a storm in the
Pacific and became an old salt before his time. Seventy movies and two Academy
Awards later, he used those memories to co-write "Wake of the Perdido Star," a
novel published by Newmarket Press. "I've been living it (the book) now for 3
1/2 years, and I'd like to move on," says Hackman, who was born on Jan. 30,
1930. "Not to say we wouldn't do it as a film if somebody was interested to give
us a hand with it. But a lot of it is a matter of creativity -- you know, we've
done it."
</P>
<P>
	   Country singer Clint Black used only acoustic instruments on "D'lectrified,"
but the album sounds as full and brash as an electric album since he used
creative arrangements and horn sections. "It sounds like a cliche, but really I
want to learn," says Black, who was born on Feb. 4, 1962. "I look at guys like
James Taylor -- his albums are better today than they ever were, after 20 or 25
years. I want to be able to have that said about me, and that's the only way
that you do it, is if you reach for something that's just out of reach." Black's
"When I Said I Do" (RCA) is currently in the Top 10 on Billboard's country
singles chart.

   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Excerpts from the cockpit voice recorder of American Airlines Flight 1420,
which crashed on landing at Little Rock, Ark., on June 1, killing 11, including
Capt. Richard Buschmann.
</P>
<P>
	   The transcripts were released Wednesday by the National Transportation
Safety Board. Text is as provided by the NTSB.
</P>
<P>
	   The recording contains the preparation for approach, descent, and landing
and ends as the aircraft ran off the runway and hit steel supports for the
airport's navigation system.
</P>
<P>
	   11:25:43 Buschmann: We got to get over there quick.
</P>
<P>
	   11:25:48 Co-pilot Michael Origel: I don't like that. That's lightning.
</P>
<P>
	   11:25:56 Buschmann: Sure is.
</P>
<P>
	   ...
</P>
<P>
	   11:26:48 Buschmann: This is the bowling alley right here.
</P>
<P>
	   11:26:50 Origel: Yeah, I know.
</P>
<P>
	   11:26:55 Buschmann: In fact those are the city lights straight out there.
</P>
<P>
	   11:26:57 Origel: That's it.
</P>
<P>
	   11:27:03 Origel: Want to go down?
</P>
<P>
	   11:27:05 Buschmann: Uh, not just yet. but, pretty soon.
</P>
<P>
	   ...
</P>
<P>
	   At 11:27:27, the pilot tells passengers about storms to the left of the
airplane, describing them as a ``quite a light show.'' A minute later, he
directs flight attendants to quickly wrap up serving drinks.
</P>
<P>
	   ...
</P>
<P>
	   11:29:52 Origel: I say we get down as soon as we can.
</P>

<P>
	   ...
</P>
<P>
	   11:39:11 Origel to tower: OK, we can uh, see the airport from here. We can
barely make it out but uh, we should be able to make two (a runway approached
from the north side of the airport). Uh, that storm is moving this way like
your, radar says it is but a little bit farther off than you thought.
</P>
<P>
	   ...

of the north and are given directions to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   ...
</P>
<P>
	   11:42:18 Buschmann: Do you have the airport? (Does the co-pilot see the
airport?)
</P>

last vector you gave us, we're on kind of a dog leg it looks like.

<HEADLINE> Public Has Mixed View of Clinton  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sheri Johansen says she doesn't like Bill Clinton much
because ``he seems like the playboy type.'' But when asked about the job he's
done as president, she thought a minute and then said grudgingly: ``I just don't
like him personally ... but I like what he's done.''
</P>
<P>
	   The mixed feelings of the delicatessen cashier from Newport, Ore., are
shared by many Americans as the president prepares to give his last State of the
Union address.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's job approval ratings spiked to almost 70 percent when news of the
Monica Lewinsky scandal broke, dropped slightly after it ended and have leveled
off at about 60 percent, give or take a few percentage points. People feel
differently about him personally, however, and are about evenly divided on that
question.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton supporter Nancy Bunch, a 51-year-old homemaker from Howell, Mich.,
said: ``I've been happy with him and I think he's done a good job, especially
with the economy. His private life is totally different from what he's doing in
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
	   But she fears his problems will hurt Vice President Al Gore's bid to succeed
Clinton, ``because Gore's been with him through all of this.''
</P>
<P>
	   Recent polls have indicated that most Americans think Gore has personal
integrity, yet an earlier poll of voter attitudes by the Pew Research Center
offered troubling signs for the vice president. Some voters, notably social
conservative Democrats, held Gore's close association with Clinton against him.
In the Democratic Iowa caucuses Monday night, Gore and Bill Bradley split the
vote of the 44 percent of the voters who view Clinton unfavorably, exit polls
indicate.
</P>
<P>
	   Presidential scholar Charles Jones suggested the tension for Americans in
balancing attitudes about the personal and professional Clinton may be at the
heart of the political phenomenon commonly referred to as ``Clinton fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``What Clinton did was to successfully present us with a hell of a
dilemma,'' said Jones, a professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin.
``When people came around and asked, 'Should we get rid of this guy?,' people
heard it as, 'Are you for good times, or are you concerned about what he's
done?'''
</P>
<P>
	   The majority response to keep the status quo ``was almost a hedonistic
answer,'' he said, and now many people find it ``kind of embarrassing.'' The
phenomenon is probably less Clinton fatigue than ``dilemma exhaustion,'' and
when people are now asked if they want it to continue, they say: '''Now's the
time to stop. I don't want it to continue,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   When the Gallup organization recently tried to separate feelings about
Clinton's job performance from feelings about him as a person, it asked people
what they thought of him personally, apart from whether they approved or
disapproved of his job as president. Only about a third of respondents said they
viewed him favorably.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I look at him as the president that we deserved,'' said Matthew Ream, a
financial analyst from Parker, Colo. ``It's kind of sad. In general, people
elect the kind of person that most resembles them.''
</P>
<P>
	   More than half the people in a recent Pew poll think Clinton's
accomplishments will outweigh his failures, while just over a third thought his
failures would prevail.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As long as the good times and the good conditions continue, it will give
people a favorable view of him, both with his approval ratings and his legacy,''
said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the
Press.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Much is made of the fact that his job approval has been regularly higher
than most people thought it should be,'' said Jones. ``Why isn't it at 80
percent? We're in the greatest period of prosperity we've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
	   For many people, the question about Clinton is purely economic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I like him, he's raising your check every month,'' said Wilma Peetles, a
retiree from Olar, S.C.
</P>
<P>
	   The last two-term president, President Reagan, retained high personal
popularity ratings even when his job approval dipped as a result of the
Iran-Contra scandal. In early 1987, just under half approved of the job he was
doing, but three-fourths approved of him as a person, a Gallup poll indicated.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They always liked the guy as a person, even when they didn't approve of
the job he was doing,'' said Frank Newport, editor-in-chief of the Gallup Poll.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's personal popularity is measured along partisan lines. Independents
are split, most Republicans view him unfavorably and most Democrats -- four out
of five -- approve of him.
</P>
<P>
	   George Hill, a 78-year-old retired masonry worker from Hamer, S.C., praised
Clinton for his accomplishments on the economy, balancing the budget and helping
protect Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's the Republicans who are raising so much sand about him,'' said Hill,
a Democrat. ``I think he's made a good president. He's done a lot for this
country. If women hadn't gotten ahold of him, he'd have been all right.''

<HEADLINE> New Hampshire: 'A whole new ballgame'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) - The abbreviated race for New Hampshire is
shaping up on the Democratic side as, in Bill Bradley's words, "a whole new
ballgame," with Vice President Al Gore seeking opportunities to hitch himself to
President Clinton's economic coattails.
<P>
	   Gore, who boomerangs between shunning Clinton and embracing him, has settled
on the latter in his attempt to win next week's primary and deny Bradley any
comeback from his sound defeat in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Before meeting Gore tonight for their last pre-primary New Hampshire debate,
Bradley campaigned at a YMCA day care center to promote his agenda for
middle-class working families. He told youngsters that he understood the
challenges of single parenthood because he cared for his daughter while he was
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had cereal most of the nights," Bradley chuckled.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president was reaching today for a chunk of the credit for the 1996
welfare reform that congressional Republicans pushed and Clinton signed. The
theme of Gore's noontime appearance at the Electropac company here was timed,
aides said, to dovetail with Clinton's welfare-related announcement today of new
measures to collect back child support.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's all-out drive for New Hampshire includes spending about $20,000 on a
half-hour TV "infomercial" to air here on Saturday, two days before the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Not only was Gore campaigning on the current record-breaking economic
expansion, but also on the premise that he could lead the country into deeper
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
	   "The question that must be answered in this election is not whether or not
we're better off than seven years ago. We know that we are," Gore said. "The
question is can we do even better?"
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Gore was briefly suspending his commitment to campaign in New
Hampshire "every minute of every hour of every day" leading to next Tuesday's
ballot, to fly to Washington at be with Clinton in the House chamber for the
State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
	   "What the Clinton-Gore administration has done over the last seven years
economically helps Al Gore a lot, and I think President Clinton will be a very
valuable asset during the campaign," said Bob Shrum, a top Gore adviser.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's message could find particular resonance in New Hampshire, where
unemployment has plunged by 5 percent during the Clinton-Gore tenure and jobs
are created at a rate of 16,000 per year. The state was losing 10,000 a year in
1992 when Clinton and Gore first ran.
</P>
<P>
	   Eric Marion, one of the municipal workers Gore met Tuesday as he delivered
coffee and donuts to snow plow crews, suggested the ripeness of Gore's strategy
shift.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the ideas that are in office now have done us some good so far,"
Marion said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, looking for a quick way to sharpen differences with Gore, all but
conceded one precious day of campaigning Tuesday when the Northeast blizzard
shut down the school basketball game and restaurant he had planned to visit.
</P>
<P>
	   In his one appearance Tuesday, Bradley appealed to voter distaste with
negative politics.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you are tired of misrepresentation in political campaigns to pursue a
personal agenda, if you are tired of what you have seen in the last decade in
this country, then you can send a message," he said at Alvirne High School in
Hudson.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley and his wife, Ernestine, later waited out the snowstorm at a Holiday
Inn, hanging around the lobby.
</P>
<P>
	   By contrast, Gore exhausted his entourage - sleepless from a wee-hours
flight out of Iowa - by skidding around Manchester looking for things to do.
</P>
<P>
	   What was to have been a one-rally day for Gore, who professed to be running
on just one hour's sleep, was suddenly crammed with impromptu stops at Dunkin'
Donuts, the plow garage, and an MTV rock concert, for which Gore changed into
tight blue jeans.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's handshake and hot coffee was enough to tip plow mechanic Henry Roux
Gore's way. "To come out on a day like this, a bad New Hampshire day, I'm
impressed with that," Roux said.
</P>
<P>
	   Now that Gore has reclaimed his front-runner's edge in statewide polls,
voters like Joe Sullivan, a teacher and self-described liberal, suggest that
Bradley has little time to waste in demonstrating an ability to beat Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   The previously undecided Manchester voter said his choice was decided in the
24 hours after Gore's 2-to-1 win over Bradley in Monday's Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought Bill Bradley was a hell of a candidate but in the long run, if Al
Gore is going to be the nominee I figured I might as well get on board,"
Sullivan said.

<HEADLINE> New Haven line riders most critical of commuter rail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - An annual satisfaction survey finds riders on
Metro-North Railroad's New Haven Line are the least satisfied of the railroad's
three main passenger groups.
<P>
	   New Haven Line customers were especially critical of the cleanliness of rest
rooms on the trains at the stations, on-time performance and communication by
Metro-North employees during stoppages and delays.
</P>
<P>
	   Metro-North spokesman Dan Brucker said Tuesday that scores on the survey,
conducted in October, are typically lower on the New Haven Line and were
probably affected by a poor on-time performance.
</P>
<P>
	   Riders on all three lines - the New Haven, Hudson and Harlem - gave their
highest marks to courtesy and responsiveness of employees and conditions at the
recently refurbished Grand Central Terminal.
</P>
<P>
	   "New Haven Line passengers are obviously very intelligent, and even though
we've had problems on the line, they are aware that we ... are trying to improve
the commute for them, that we are trying to respond to them," Brucker said.
</P>
<P>
	   James Cameron of the Connecticut Metro North-Shoreline East Rail Commuter
Council, said the scores are consistent with previous years.
</P>
<P>
	   "The station masters, the conductors, the employees on the trains are very
positive changes," Cameron said. "Now if we could only make the equipment work
the way the people are improving, that would be a good sign."
</P>
<P>
	   On a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being very satisfied, New Haven riders gave an
overall rating of 7.4 to Metro-North.
</P>
<P>
	   Hudson and Harlem commuters gave scores of 7.9 and 8.0, respectively.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall conditions on the trains were rated 6.7 by New Haven Line riders.
Hudson and Harlem line customers gave 7.3 ratings.
</P>
<P>
	   Rest room cleanliness on the trains received the lowest score of the 30
individual questions, with a 5.1 rating systemwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Other low scores were for condition of station rest rooms, availability of
parking, information about the length and cause of delays at train stations and
timeliness of information from Metro-North during disruptions.

<HEADLINE> Transcript From American Air 1420  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Excerpts from the cockpit voice recorder of American Airlines Flight 1420,
which crashed on landing at Little Rock, Ark., on June 1, killing 11, including
Capt. Richard Buschmann.
</P>
<P>
	   The transcripts were released Wednesday by the National Transportation
Safety Board. Text is as provided by the NTSB.
</P>
<P>
	   The recording contains the preparation for approach, descent, and landing
and ends as the aircraft ran off the runway and hit steel supports for the
airport's navigation system.
</P>
<P>
	   11:25:43 Buschmann: We got to get over there quick.
</P>
<P>
	   11:25:48 Co-pilot Michael Origel: I don't like that. That's lightning.
</P>
<P>
	   11:25:56 Buschmann: Sure is.
</P>
<P>
	   ...
</P>
<P>
	   11:26:48 Buschmann: This is the bowling alley right here.
</P>
<P>
	   11:26:50 Origel: Yeah, I know.
</P>
<P>
	   11:26:55 Buschmann: In fact those are the city lights straight out there.
</P>
<P>
	   11:26:57 Origel: That's it.
</P>
<P>
	   11:27:03 Origel: Want to go down?
</P>
<P>
	   11:27:05 Buschmann: Uh, not just yet. but, pretty soon.
</P>
<P>
	   ...
</P>
<P>
	   At 11:27:27, the pilot tells passengers about storms to the left of the
airplane, describing them as a ``quite a light show.'' A minute later, he
directs flight attendants to quickly wrap up serving drinks.
</P>
<P>
	   ...
</P>
<P>
	   11:29:52 Origel: I say we get down as soon as we can.
</P>
<P>
	   11:30 to 11:31:21, a number of pre-landing checks are completed.
</P>
<P>
	   ...
</P>
<P>
	   11:34:09 Approach tower: American fourteen twenty, Little Rock approach
roger. We have a thunderstorm just northwest of the airport moving uh, through
the area now. Wind is two eight zero at two eight, gusts four and uh, I'll have
new weather for you in just a moment I'm sure. (Wind from the west-northwest at
26 knots with gusts to 44 knots.)
</P>
<P>
	   11:34:21 Origel to tower: Yeah we can see the uh, lightning ...
</P>
<P>
	   ...
</P>
<P>
	   11:39:11 Origel to tower: OK, we can uh, see the airport from here. We can
barely make it out but uh, we should be able to make two (a runway approached
from the north side of the airport). Uh, that storm is moving this way like
your, radar says it is but a little bit farther off than you thought.
</P>
<P>
	   ...
</P>
<P>
	   11:39:44 Approach tower: And uh, right now I have a uh, windshear alert. the
center field wind is three four zero at one zero north boundary wind is three
zero at two five. Northwest boundary wind is zero one zero at one five
(different wind directions reported at different places around the airport.)
</P>
<P>
	   11:39:52 cockpit recorder: unintelligble.
</P>
<P>
	   ...
</P>
<P>
	   At 11:40, the pilots decide to approach the airport from the south instead
of the north and are given directions to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   ...
</P>
<P>
	   11:42:18 Buschmann: Do you have the airport? (Does the co-pilot see the
airport?)
</P>
<P>
	   11:42:19 Origel: unintelligible.
</P>
<P>
	   11:42:19 Buschmann: Is that it right there?
</P>
<P>
	   11:42:20 cockpit recorder, voice unknown: OK.
</P>
<P>
	   11:42:22 Origel: (unintelligible) See, I can't.
</P>
<P>
	   11:42:23 Buschmann: I don't see a runway.
</P>
<P>
	   11:42:25 Origel: Go out this way.
</P>
<P>
	   11:42:26 Approach tower: American fourteen twenty, it appears we have uh,
second part of this storm moving through. The winds now, three four zero at one
six, gusts three four (north-northwest winds at 16 knots, gusting to 34 knots).
</P>
<P>
	   11:42:33 Buschmann: OK.
</P>
<P>
	   11:42:34 Origel to tower: Roger that.
</P>
<P>
	   11:42:39 Origel: You wanna accept a short approach? Want to keep it in
tight?
</P>
<P>
	   11:42:41 Buschmann: Yeah, if you see the runway. 'Cause I don't quite see
it.
</P>
<P>
	   11:42:44 Origel: Yeah, it's right here, see it?
</P>
<P>
	   11:42:47 Buschmann: (grunts). You just point me in the right direction and
I'll start slowing down here. ...
</P>
<P>
	   11:43:08 Origel to tower: I can, we'll, we'll (start) the visual. If we can
do it.
</P>
<P>
	   11:43:11 Approach tower: American fourteen twenty's cleared visual approach
runway four right. If you lose it, need some help, let me know please.
</P>
<P>
	   11:43:15 Origel to tower: I'll stay with you as long as possible, OK?

<HEADLINE> Critics: Mall plan lacks proper environmental review  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - The environmental and traffic effects of a
proposed shopping mall in the city's Long Wharf area have undergone less
scrutiny than other developments, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
<P>
	   The mall development, which would be built with $60 million of state money,
is being challenged by a rival mall company, environmental groups, commuters and
downtown New Haven businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hartford Courant reported Wednesday that its review of state records
found that an air pollution permit required by the Department of Environmental
Protection for new highway ramps at similar sites was not required for the Long
Wharf project.
</P>
<P>
	   The "indirect source permit" acknowledges and allows the extra air pollution
that will come from additional highway traffic to a new development.
</P>
<P>
	   Such a permit was required for a proposed mall in Plainville because a new
highway interchange was to be built, and another ramp was to be rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
	   The New Haven project's plans are more extensive and include at least four
new highway ramps, entrance roadways and a loop road to serve the mall.
</P>
<P>
	   "The provision of public funding, in conjunction with all the dodging that
these state agencies are doing, raises some serious questions," said James
Smart, a Hartford lawyer who represents mall opponents suing the State Traffic
Commission and developer Long Wharf Galleria LLC.
</P>
<P>
	   Internal memos obtained by The Courant showed the DEP originally required
the air pollution permit for the mall. The environmental agency changed its
mind, however, after the state Department of Transportation reinterpreted the
regulations.
</P>
<P>
	   James F. Byrnes, the DOT's chief engineer said the new ramps do not require
a permit because they would only improve and modify existing access to Long
Wharf, not provide new interchange service.
</P>
<P>
	   Karyl Lee Hall, staff attorney for Connecticut Fund for the Environment,
said the DEP decision violates precedent.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of the mall also accuse the state Department of Economic and
Community Development of inadequately reviewing the proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency's draft report almost a year ago said the mall would not
significantly affect the environment or existing businesses - an important
factor in determining whether the project qualifies for state money.
</P>
<P>
	   The draft review said little about contamination of soil at the site, except
that it would be cleaned up. About a fifth of the 55-acre site is contaminated
with coal tar.
</P>
<P>
	   The mall developers are seeking an exemption from state soil and groundwater
cleanup standards, saying no one would be exposed to health hazards from the
pollutants. They plan to seal the contamination in place and build the mall over
it.
</P>
<P>
	   Rival mall company Westfield Corp., which owns malls in Milford, Meriden and
Trumbull, found in its own environmental review that contamination at the site
is as high as 2,000 times the state limits for redevelopment.
</P>
<P>
	   The DECD is working on its final report. Agency spokesman Jim Watson said
officials continue to believe that the mall would not have a significant effect.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics of the mall plan said DECD's findings are not credible.
</P>
<P>
	   "A finding of no significant impact does not seem to pass the straight-face
test. It's hard to make the case even on the traffic alone that there's not an
environmental impact that needs to be considered," said Susan Merrow, a member
of the state Council on Environmental Quality.

<HEADLINE> Seton Hall students return to class for first time since fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) - Seton Hall University's president has moved
into the school's freshman dormitory where a fire killed three students and
injured 58 last week, university officials said Wednesday.
<P>
	   Monsignor Robert Sheeran will live in the south side of Boland Hall "for the
foreseeable future," spokeswoman Lisa Grider said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a very tangible way to show the students in Boland Hall that he's
with them, that he supports them, that we're going to do everything we can to
help them," Grider said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheeran lived in Boland Hall as an undergraduate in the 1960s and moved into
the dorm again on Tuesday from an apartment on campus.
</P>
<P>
	   Classes resumed Wednesday at the 9,200-student Roman Catholic university for
the first time since the fire broke out in a third-floor lounge on Boland Hall's
north side last Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   Five students remained hospitalized, four in critical condition with burns.
A memorial service was scheduled Thursday for the three who died.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire remained on the minds of many students trudging to class across the
snow-covered campus, still marred by a few ribbons of yellow police tape.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm still scared and terrified of the whole thing," said Shakia Arrington,
21, of Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
	   Arrington, a senior, said many freshmen decided not to return to school
after the fire. Grider said she was unaware if any students had informed the
school they were dropping out.
</P>
<P>
	   But upperclassmen said they understood how a traumatic experience so early
into their college years could spoil the experience.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a pile of bad memories here, already" for the freshmen, said senior
Matthew Fossum, 21, of Concord, N.H. "I can understand wanting to leave."
</P>
<P>
	   Many students said they were eager to return to class and their daily
routines.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want it to get back to normal," said Megan Carey, 19, a sophomore from
Voorhees.
</P>
<P>
	   But students can't put the incident to rest until they know what caused the
fire, said Joshua Durand, 22, of Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
	   Essex County prosecutors continued to interview students and have not
speculated on a cause.
</P>
<P>
	   Durand said it appeared unlikely to him that the fire was an accident, and
more likely caused by "a prank, or something more malicious."
</P>
<P>
	   The fire has brought renewed attention to fire safety at Seton Hall and
campuses nationwide, and students said they wanted more vigorous fire safety
training and sprinklers installed in all dormitories.
</P>
<P>
	   Durand, who served as a resident assistant for two years, said he instructed
students on fire safety during about two floor meetings a year. He said many
students evacuated a few times a year because of false alarms, but he recalled
no organized fire drills in his 3 1/2 years on campus.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know if they were lax in what they didn't do," he said of the
university, "but anything now would be helpful."

<HEADLINE> Big Movers in the Stock Market  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that are moving substantially or trading heavily
today on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   Corning shares rose as the company raised an estimated $1.91 billion through
the sale of 13 million new common shares. The company said it would use the
money for acquisitions, to repay debt and for other corporate purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   EMC shares fell despite reporting fourth quarter earnings of 34 cents a
share, excluding a one-time charge related to an acquisition. The figure beat
Wall Street analysts' estimates of 31 cents a share. Still, the company reported
lower-than-expected revenues for an important segment of its business and
investors fled.
</P>
<P>
	   Merrill Lynch on Tuesday reported fourth quarter earnings more than double
those of a year ago and well above analysts' expectations. The company reported
profits of $764 million, or $1.80 a share, well above the $1.39 a share analysts
had predicted. A year ago, Merrill Lynch reported profits of $359 million, or 86
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Coca-Cola announced it plans to eliminate 20 percent of its work force, or
6,000 jobs, in an effort to cut costs and shift responsibility to local markets.
The job cuts will result in pretax charges of $800 million this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Qualcomm, which makes cellular phone technology, beat analysts' earnings
estimates by a penny, reporting earnings of 25 cents a share. But the company
warned that sales of cellular chips may be off this quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   EBay reported fourth-quarter earnings of 4 cents a share, excluding one-time
charges, beating the 2-cents a share estimate expected by Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
	   Covad, a provider of high-speed Internet access over ordinary copper
telephone lines, reported a fourth-quarter loss of 80 cents a share, beating the
94-cent average loss predicted by analysts.
</P>
<P>
	   CheckFree, an electronic commerce company, reported a loss of 8 cents a
share for its fiscal second quarter, compared with earnings of 22 cents a year
ago. Excluding one-time charges, the company broke even during the second
quarter of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani: Hillary Clinton is old-fashioned left-winger  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Mayor Rudolph Giuliani took expected Senate rival,
Hillary Rodham Clinton, to task Wednesday for embracing "old-fashioned,
classical left-wing thinking" as she prepares for her first-time run for office.
<P>
	   The mayor said his approach was "a more progressive way of looking at
things" that has "made government, particularly in New York City, much more
accountable."
</P>
<P>
	   "I think all throughout this campaign you're going to see a big
philosophical difference," the mayor said during an interview with Albany's
WROW-AM radio.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign trumpeted a published report that Giuliani
is appealing to fans of conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh for
money, a new tidbit about the mayor's use of conservative-oriented mailing lists
to help finance his campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   According to a statement from Mrs. Clinton's campaign team, Giuliani "is
raising millions of dollars with hate-filled appeals to a nationwide network of
far-right donors."
</P>
<P>
	   The moves appeared designed to paint the two Senate rivals into extreme
ideological corners.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton's campaign spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said, "Hillary is a new
Democrat who supports balanced budgets, tax cuts and the death penalty."
</P>
<P>
	   For his part, Giuliani's support for abortion and gay rights and strict
gun-control measures has often left him at odds with conservatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani's comments came after he was asked about attacks on his policies of
jailing the homeless who refuse to get off the streets and of pressing a plan
that could remove children from welfare recipients who refuse to work.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor has said he wants to find jobs and help for those on welfare and
on the streets.
</P>
<P>
	   "Being dependent on the government does not get you out of poverty," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   On the money front, the weekly New York Observer reported that Giuliani was
using mailing lists that included one comprised of people who bought ties and
other articles of clothing from Limbaugh's "No Boundaries" collection. The
newspaper said other lists being used by Giuliani were made up of people opposed
to abortion, gay rights and using any language other than English in schools.
</P>
<P>
	   The Observer broke the story last week that Giuliani was using conservative
fund-raising guru Richard Viguerie to help with direct mail appeals to people
who might want to keep Hillary Clinton out of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate comment from the mayor's campaign about the latest
report.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton was in Florida, raising money for her expected
Senate bid while Giuliani was headed for a fund-raising event hosted by a group
of Philadelphia-area business executives and featuring Republican Sen. Arlen
Specter of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither Mrs. Clinton nor Giuliani has formally entered the Senate race
although both have been raising money and campaigning for months. She is set to
officially declare her candidacy on Feb. 6.
</P>
<P>
	   "Things are in the works, but I don't want to give out a chronology right
now," Giuliani said Wednesday when asked about his announcement plans.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor also said he hoped to have "a certain number" of debates with Mrs.
Clinton as the campaign developed. Wolfson said Mrs. Clinton also expected to
engage in debates.

<HEADLINE> Women Presidents' Organization establishes chapter in New Jersey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Hope Americo Tinsley of Verona recently had to
choose whether to attend her 9-year-old daughter's school play or a client
meeting.
<P>
	   Tinsley, 47, who turned a home-based business into a human resources
consulting firm with annual revenues of just over $1 million, decided to go to
the play and go to the meeting late. She risked disappointing her second biggest
client and jeopardizing thousands of dollars worth of business.
</P>
<P>
	   Such dilemmas are common for women who manage their own businesses. Now they
have a peer group they can turn to for advice and support.
</P>
<P>
	   Women Presidents' Organization, a national organization that provides
networking opportunities for women who own businesses that gross more than $2
million - $1 million if the company is service-oriented - has formed a New
Jersey chapter. The group held its first working meeting for its six members
last week in Parsippany.
</P>
<P>
	   "Any time you can get a bunch of business people together to tap into
real-life cases it becomes an advisory group," said Raylie Dunkel, facilitator
of the New Jersey chapter. "This is invaluable information."
</P>
<P>
	   Dunkel, owner of The Brinkerhoff Group, a Jersey City-based firm that
manages a consortium of corporate trainers and consultants, said she hopes that
as membership continues to rise it will dispel the myth that most self-employed
women "knit pot holders and take them to church bazaars."
</P>
<P>
	   There are 5.89 million women-owned businesses nationwide, with 79,000
earning revenues of $1 million or more, according to U.S. Census figures from
1992, the latest available.
</P>
<P>
	   Marsha Firestone, president of the Women Presidents' Association in New York
City, said she believes there are at least 1,000 women in New Jersey eligible to
join her organization. She hopes eventually to form chapters in the central and
southern parts of the state. Each chapter is limited to 25 members.
</P>
<P>
	   Several members said they joined because "it's lonely at the top" and only
their peers could understand the hardships they face on the job.
</P>
<P>
	   Tinsley, president of Consultants for Corporate Benefits in Newark, said she
tried other executive-level groups geared for both men and women, but didn't
join.
</P>
<P>
	   "The men at these levels are clearly ... faced with different problems," she
said. "Like when I walk into a meeting and they're looking for the white guy in
charge. He would never be faced with that because he is the white guy in
charge."
</P>
<P>
	   Marcie A. Horowitz, president of New Jersey Association of Women Business
Owners in Bound Brook, said she believes there is a need for a networking group
strictly for women presidents.
</P>
<P>
	   Horowitz said she noticed women who run home-based businesses don't share
the same concerns as those who run larger companies with employees dependent on
their actions. Those women, she said, "feel isolated, they feel they have no one
to talk to."
</P>
<P>
	   Dawn Capalbo, owner of I.F.S. Air Freight in Eatontown, agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   Capalbo and her late husband founded the trucking company in 1983. She
continued to run the business after Samuel Capalbo suddenly died of a heart
attack five years later.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't have a chance to ask him a lot of questions," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Capalbo rebuffed those who said she should get out of a male-dominated
industry and held her ground when salesmen didn't take her seriously.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't feel all alone anymore," said Capalbo, a 42-year-old Rumson
resident with 30 employees. "I don't feel as though I don't have anywhere to
turn. At some point in everybody's career you need assistance. Nobody does it
alone."
</P>
<P>
	   Gayle Martz, owner of Sherpa's Pet Trading Co. in New York, credits the
organization for helping her expand her manufacturing business.
</P>
<P>
	   She found the group's "under the microscope" session particularly helpful.
That's when an individual member discusses problems at the office, such as human
resources, financing or marketing issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Martz, a former flight attendant who designs bags travelers can use to carry
pets, said her company's revenues were just under the $2 million mark when she
joined a New York City chapter three years ago. She posted $3.5 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have to have a common goal. That goal is success in business and to get
past the limitations in your mind. That comes from sharing, support and the
strength of an organized peer group.
</P>
<P>
	   "I call it a confidential group for growth. You don't find that type of
camaraderie anywhere else," she said.

<HEADLINE> City Lost Money on Raitt Concert  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SAN RAFAEL, Calif. (AP) -- The city of San Rafael hoped to clean up with a
high-profile New Year's Eve party featuring Bonnie Raitt and a $22,000 balloon
drop. Instead, it took a $1.2 million bath.
</P>
<P>
	   That's how much city officials said was lost on the highly publicized event
when only 5,000 people bought tickets instead of the 11,000 needed to break
even.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Up 55.53  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock markets were mixed today, as investors balanced
strong corporate earnings reports with fears of a pending interest rate hike.
</P>
<P>
	   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
55.53 at 11,085.42.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 0.96 at 1,409.07, and the Nasdaq composite index was off 33.13 at 4,134.28.
</P>
<P>
	   "Overall, the market is going through a recovery after several down
sessions," said Ricky Harrington, a technical analyst with Wachovia Securities
in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, some well-known technology companies were punished for not
living up to investors' extraordinary expectations for the sector.
</P>
<P>
	   A case in point was cellular phone chipmaker Qualcomm, down 22 25/64 to 126
39/64. Despite beating analysts' earnings estimates by a penny, the company
warned Tuesday that sales may be off this quarter. Investors promptly punished
the company, driving the stock down nearly 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   And software maker and network storage company EMC Corp. fell despite
reporting fourth-quarter earnings of 34 cents a share, excluding a one-time
charge related to an acquisition. The figure beat Wall Street analysts'
estimates of 31 cents a share but the company reported lower-than-expected
revenues for an important segment of its business, causing investors to flee.
</P>
<P>
	   Some old line companies were faring better, such as Corning, up 5 3/8 at 156
5/8, and Merrill Lynch, up 5 1/2 at 86 1/2.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said investors were uneasy about interest rates with Federal
Reserve policy makers meeting next week. Another factor adding to their caution
was President Clinton's State of the Union address, slated for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 755 million shares, up from 723 million
shares yesterday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index was up 2.13 at 523.72.

<HEADLINE> Ark. Air Crash Transcript Released  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID A. LIEB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Rocked by high wind on their approach to Little
Rock, two American Airlines pilots realized their jet was ``way off'' course
moments before it crashed, according to transcripts released today.
</P>
<P>
	   At a hearing later, the co-pilot told National Transportation Safety Board
investigators he wasn't sure if the pilot had properly set the spoilers, the
wing panels that are opened to help slow an airplane.
</P>
<P>
	   Co-pilot Michael Origel, who made the ``way off'' assessment, was the first
witness called at the hearing into the June 1 crash of Flight 1420. Eleven
people were killed, including the pilot, Capt. Richard Buschmann, and 89 were
injured.
</P>
<P>
	   The cockpit voice recorder transcripts, released ahead of the hearing,
showed that the two pilots realized they were off course just before the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   As ominous clouds rolled toward the airport from the northwest with heavy
rain, wind and hail, the plane made a ``bowling alley'' approach from the
southwest, according to previously released control tower tapes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going right into this crap,'' Origel told Buschmann as the plane
approached the airport. Buschmann complained seconds earlier about making a
visual approach to the airport in bad weather at night.
</P>
<P>
	   Before today's hearing, passengers and their relatives met for about 30
minutes privately with NTSB officials previewing a video re-enactment of the
descent. More than 100 survivors and relatives were at the hearing in a reserved
area stocked with tissue boxes.
</P>
<P>
	   Origel told the board today that American Airlines policy did not require
him to call out that the plane's spoilers were being set for deployment on
landing.
</P>
<P>
	   NTSB investigators have said previously that the spoilers did not deploy as
they normally would. And there is no verbal confirmation on the transcript that
the pilots set the spoilers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe after the gear was down, Captain Buschmann armed the spoilers,''
Origel told the board.
</P>
<P>
	   However, he said he did not recall whether the spoiler handle was set in the
proper position.
</P>
<P>
	   The hearing was expected to run through Friday. A summary of the NTSB's
findings -- but no theories -- is to be released at the end of the hearing. A
final report on the crash, and its cause, isn't expected until some time later.
</P>
<P>
	   Origel told investigators in interviews after the crash that he had
suggested aborting the landing. According to the documents released today, a
section of the tape that the NTSB investigators deemed inaudible is where Origel
says he made such a suggestion. The NTSB refused to revise the transcript to
insert the comment Origel says he made.
</P>
<P>
	   About a minute before landing, Buschmann complained ``this is a can of
worms'' but continued toward the airport. When the plane was several hundred
feet from the runway, the pilot uttered an expletive and said: ``We're off
course.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're way off,'' Origel replied.
</P>
<P>
	   The co-pilot told NTSB investigators the plane landed with its main landing
gear to the right of the runway and the nose pointing to the left. The jet went
into a slide and ran off the north end of the runway, down an embankment and
nose-first into steel supports for the airport navigation system.
</P>
<P>
	   At its hearing, the NTSB will look at weather conditions, decision-making
and the plane's mechanical operations, among other things.
</P>
<P>
	   The crash was deadliest on U.S. soil in 1999, although 217 were killed in
the crash of an EgyptAir jet off Nantucket on Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, the Federal Aviation Administration released a transcript of
conversations between the cockpit of Flight 1420 and the Little Rock air traffic
control tower that included repeated warnings about a strong thunderstorm and
high winds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have heavy rain on the airport. ... The visibility is less than a
mile,'' the tower informed the cockpit about three minutes before it was to have
touched down. A minute later the tower gave a wind shear alert. Wind shear --
sudden, dangerous shifts in wind speed and direction -- is considered a major
hazard to aircraft taking off or landing.
</P>
<P>
	   Passenger Arnold Bowden said he felt a strong northwest wind that moved the
plane just seconds before it landed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When I first felt the wind and we got hit by rain simultaneously, I said,
`I don't think he's going to make the runway! Get down!''' Bowden recalled
Tuesday. ``We grabbed our knees and bent forward.''

<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that are moving substantially or trading heavily
today on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   Corning shares rose as the company raised an estimated $1.91 billion through
the sale of 13 million new common shares. The company said it would use the
money for acquisitions, to repay debt and for other corporate purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   EMC shares fell despite reporting fourth quarter earnings of 34 cents a
share, excluding a one-time charge related to an acquisition. The figure beat
Wall Street analysts' estimates of 31 cents a share. Still, the company reported
lower-than-expected revenues for an important segment of its business and
investors fled.
</P>
<P>
	   Merrill Lynch on Tuesday reported fourth quarter earnings more than double
those of a year ago and well above analysts' expectations. The company reported
profits of $764 million, or $1.80 a share, well above the $1.39 a share analysts
had predicted. A year ago, Merrill Lynch reported profits of $359 million, or 86
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Coca-Cola announced it plans to eliminate 20 percent of its work force, or
6,000 jobs, in an effort to cut costs and shift responsibility to local markets.
The job cuts will result in pretax charges of $800 million this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Qualcomm, which makes cellular phone technology, beat analysts' earnings
estimates by a penny, reporting earnings of 25 cents a share. But the company
warned that sales of cellular chips may be off this quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   EBay reported fourth-quarter earnings of 4 cents a share, excluding one-time
charges, beating the 2-cents a share estimate expected by Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
	   Covad, a provider of high-speed Internet access over ordinary copper
telephone lines, reported a fourth-quarter loss of 80 cents a share, beating the
94-cent average loss predicted by analysts.
</P>
<P>
	   CheckFree, an electronic commerce company, reported a loss of 8 cents a
share for its fiscal second quarter, compared with earnings of 22 cents a year
ago. Excluding one-time charges, the company broke even during the second
quarter of 1998.

<HEADLINE> 4 Westchester guards accused of attacks on female inmates  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HAWTHORNE, N.Y. (AP) - Four veteran guards at the Westchester County
Jail were accused Wednesday of sexual attacks on female inmates, ranging from
rape and sodomy to stripping on demand.
<P>
	   "These acts are acts of intimidation, degradation, humiliation and serious
abuse," said District Attorney Jeanine Pirro.
</P>
<P>
	   County Executive Andrew Spano called the crimes "an abuse of power" and
announced that he was immediately banning male officers from the 10 posts inside
the women prisoners' living quarters, ending a bid-by-seniority system.
</P>
<P>
	   "These things are happening too often at the women's facility," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The sex scandal broke one day after a correction sergeant was convicted of
covering up the fatal beating of a recovering heroin addict by guards at the
Nassau County Jail. Three other Nassau guards had already pleaded guilty in the
federal civil rights case and the Justice Department is investigating the jail.
</P>
<P>
	   The Westchester suspects were arrested Wednesday morning and taken to court
for arraignment. If they don't make bail, they will be imprisoned at some other
jail "for their own safety," said Correction Commissioner Rocco Pozzi.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers were identified as:
</P>
<P>
	   -Carlos Aldarondo, 33, a 12-year veteran, accused of statutory rape and
sodomy for allegedly engaging in intercourse and oral sex in the cell of a
30-year-old prisoner.
</P>
<P>
	   -Javier Corona, 31, accused of statutory rape for allegedly taking a
32-year-old inmate into a supply closet for intercourse. He has been a
correction officer for nine years.
</P>
<P>
	   -Michael Downey, 39, accused of official misconduct and sexual abuse on the
word of three prisoners who said he directed them to expose private parts. He
has 12 years on the job.
</P>
<P>
	   -Robert Escalera, 39, another nine-year veteran, accused of official
misconduct for allegedly demanding that a 31-year-old inmate, who was suffering
from a toothache, reveal her sexual parts in exchange for Tylenol. Escalera is
also accused of threatening the inmate after she spoke to investigators.
</P>
<P>
	   The men were suspended with pay, but the pay will end within two days, Pozzi
said. If convicted, Aldarondo and Corona could be sentenced to four years in
prison. Downey and Escalera could get a year on each count.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation began after the friend of one inmate wrote to the county
executive, the district attorney and the Correction Department to lodge
allegations against Downey. Investigators "came across information that seemed
to indicate this was widespread," Spano said.
</P>
<P>
	   A 1996 state law declares that even if sex between a guard and an inmate is
consensual, it is statutory rape because the inmate's subservient position makes
legal consent impossible.
</P>
<P>
	   "They have complete power and control over female inmates," Mrs. Pirro said.
"Inmates are reliant on correction officers for everything from protection to
food to safety to sanitary napkins."
</P>
<P>
	   She said half a dozen county jail officers have already been convicted on
similar sex charges, and "more inmates are coming forward."
</P>
<P>
	   The jail houses women who are either awaiting trial or serving sentences of
up to one year.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will prosecute sexual abuse charges whether the victim is accosted in
the street, in her home or in a criminal facility," Mrs. Pirro said.
</P>
<P>
	   Detective Glenna Lunn of the county police interviewed about 30 women, in
and out of prison, to find victims and witnesses. She said their solidarity,
especially considering the potential for retaliation, was impressive.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were very strong women," she said. "They should be proud of themselves
for coming forward."

<HEADLINE> Grandmothers To Visit Elian in Fla.  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The grandmothers of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez headed to
Florida today for a government-ordered visit with the Cuban boy while political
maneuvering intensifies over legislation to make him a U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
	   The two women made an impassioned appeal to Congress on Tuesday not to pass
such a bill, saying Elian was a Cuban citizen and belonged with his father and
them in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's our right to see our grandson and take him back home,'' Mariela
Quintana, the child's paternal grandmother, said during a visit to Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   They won't be able to do that when they see Elian in Miami Beach, however.
The meeting, planned for 4 p.m. EST, was set as just a visit by the Immigration
and Naturalization Service after efforts by the grandmothers to see their
grandson in Miami on Monday fell through.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque demanded during a visit to Moscow
today that the boy be returned, accusing the United States of violating his
human rights. Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov also has endorsed the idea of
returning the boy.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite no prospect of taking Elian with them, his Cuban grandmothers still
looked forward to the visit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know if I'll cry or if I'll laugh'' when seeing Elian for the
first time in more than two months, Raquel Rodriquez, Elian's maternal
grandmother, told CNN Tuesday after the INS ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, said today the grandmothers recalled in
their meeting with lawmakers that when Elian was rescued from the Atlantic on
Nov. 25, ``he was able to give his father's name and telephone number.''
</P>
<P>
	   One of the father's relatives, Jackson Lee said on ABC's ``Good Morning
America,'' called another relative ``and said go to the hospital and take care
of him overnight and make sure he gets back home.''
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton supported the grandmother's cause, hinting he might veto
the citizenship legislation if it passes. And those in the Senate seeking
Elian's repatriation to Cuba suggested they might use delaying tactics,
including a filibuster, to keep the Senate from debating the measure.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The idea that the Senate and the House of Representatives is going to
determine the fate of a 6-year-old is pathetic,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian belongs with his father and grandmothers, Dodd said. ``We can have
good families in bad countries,'' he said after a meeting with the grandmothers.
``This is a good family.''
</P>
<P>
	   The snowstorm that gripped Washington, as well as much of the Atlantic
seaboard, and the rising combativeness of those opposing the citizenship bill
prompted Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., to put off trying to bring
the measure up until next week.
</P>
<P>
	   Lott earlier had said it could come up as early as today.
</P>
<P>
	   That same snowstorm also was making it unclear exactly when the grandmothers
would be able to leave for Miami Beach, since Washington-area airports were
mostly shut down Tuesday. The grandmothers and their representatives said they
would leave at the first opportunity.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS, which is part of the Justice Department, announced late Tuesday
that Elian's Florida family had agreed to today's visit. Earlier in the day the
INS had said it had the authority to order the family to agree to the meeting
under the arrangement by which the boy has been allowed to stay in this country
pending further immigration proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The meeting will take place at the time and site selected by the
Immigration Service,'' Justice spokeswoman Carole Florman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Florman said the government had reassured the relatives that today's meeting
at the Miami Beach home of the president of a Dominican college would be just a
visit and would not result in Elian's being taken back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers will see Elian privately, but the boy's Florida relatives
will be nearby in the house at the time, Florman said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Miami, the lead attorney for Elian's relatives, Spencer Eig, said,
``Elian has stated that he's a little bit afraid to go all by himself because
he's afraid they might be forced to take him back to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said today's visit was expected to last two hours and called the INS
``heavy handed'' in its dealings.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS has ruled that the boy should be returned to his father in Cuba.
Elian's Florida relatives have challenged the order in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy was found clinging to a life preserver in the Atlantic on Nov. 25
after his mother and 10 others died when their boat sank en route from Cuba to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The two grandmothers made the rounds of Capitol Hill on Tuesday, meeting
with legislators sympathetic to their wish to have Elian returned to Cuba and
their opposition to congressionally imposed citizenship on Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., said the grandmothers told them Elian's mother was
on the ill-fated boat not to flee Castro's oppression but because of pressure
from her boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We asked some rather pointed questions,'' Hagel said. ``She was forced on
that boat.''
</P>
<P>
	   Versions of the citizenship bill are before both the House and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   The measure, drafted by members of the Florida congressional delegation,
would confer U.S. citizenship on Elian, thus removing the INS jurisdiction from
the case.

<HEADLINE> German Cabinet OKs Nazi Fund Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By BURT HERMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- Germany's Cabinet approved a draft law Wednesday on
distributing payments to survivors of Nazi-era forced and slave labor, but
officials said there was still time to change the bill to answer the criticisms
of lawyers and victims' groups.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill was not made public, pending possible changes, and it will be
reviewed by the Cabinet again in March, said government spokeswoman Charima
Reinhardt.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed law has come under attack because earlier versions counted
previous compensation against payments victims could receive from the new $5.2
billion fund. Germany has paid the equivalent of about $60 billion in
compensation for other Nazi crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Victims also have complained the draft would limit compensation to workers
deported to Germany under its 1937 borders, before Hitler's offensives into
Europe started.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're totally open to changes,'' Finance Minister Hans Eichel said
Wednesday in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
	   Reinhardt said German envoy Otto Lambsdorff would discuss both criticisms
would at the next round of the negotiations over the compensation fund, to begin
Monday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   About half of the roughly 235,000 slave laborers covered under the fund are
Jews, many of whom have received earlier compensation from Germany. Up to 2.3
million people, mostly non-Jews from Eastern Europe, stand to receive payments
from the new fund.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With this proposed bill, the government confirms its will, together with
the participating companies, to give a further indication of as soon as possible
undoing the wrongs inflicted on many people by Germans during World War II,''
Reinhardt said.
</P>
<P>
	   German industry proposed the fund a year ago, under pressure of class-action
lawsuits in the United States. The U.S. government has said it will step in to
intervene if new cases arise and suggest to judges that claims be handled by the
fund.
</P>
<P>
	   New York attorney Mel Weiss, one of the lawyers representing victims, said
changes to the proposal would have to be ``very material.'' In the meantime, he
said victims' cases continue to move forward.
</P>
<P>
	   About 130 companies have joined the fund so far, but Lambsdorff on Wednesday
criticized what he said was the slow pace of companies stepping up to join.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a total responsibility of the German economy -- it's not about
whether individual firms used forced laborers or not,'' Lambsdorff told German
radio.
</P>
<P>
	   The fund is to be split evenly between industry and government. Germany also
is urging cities and states that used slave labor during the war to participate.
On Wednesday, the city of Munich said it would contribute the equivalent of $1.5
million to the fund.

<HEADLINE> Cohen, Chinese General Hold Session  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. and Chinese officials on Wednesday were wrapping up
talks aimed at resuming normal military-to-military contacts, including a
possible visit to Beijing this year by Defense Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
	   China cut off military contacts with the United States after the mistaken
U.S. bombing of China's embassy in Yugoslavia last May.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen's spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said People's Liberation Army Lt. Gen.
Xiong Guangkai and other Chinese military officials were holding a second day of
substantive talks in the Pentagon with a U.S. delegation headed by Walter
Slocombe, the undersecretary of defense for policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen was to meet with Xiong late in the day, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
	   A former head of military intelligence, Xiong is deputy chief of the general
staff of the People's Liberation Army. He is one of China's most politically
influential generals and is known for hard-line views on the United States. He
is a member of the ruling Communist Party's committee that sets policy toward
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to a 2000 agenda for military exchanges, the two sides were
expected to discuss the situation in North Korea, U.S. plans for ballistic
missile defenses, expansion of the NATO alliance and Asia-Pacific regional
issues, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon hopes the talks will clarify prospects for expanding high-level
contacts, including a visit to Beijing this year by Adm. Dennis Blair, commander
in chief of the U.S. Pacific Command, and by Cohen. Cohen was forced to cancel a
planned visit to Beijing last year when the Kosovo conflict began.
</P>
<P>
	   China agreed to send Xiong to Washington after the Clinton administration
said in mid-December it would seek $28 million from Congress for the extensive
bomb damage to China's embassy in Belgrade. China agreed to pay $2.87 million
for damage done in reprisal attacks on the U.S. Embassy and consular offices in
China.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Changes in European defenses will not diminish America's
role but only enhance Europe's, Britain's defense minister said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Geoff Hoon, on his first visit to Washington as defense minister, said he
was trying to reassure members of Congress, U.S. defense officials and others
that a plan to develop a 60,000-troop European-only defense force within NATO by
2003 is good for the United States as well as Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not talking about a standing army. We're not talking about people
wearing a European Union insignia,'' he said, declaring such a force would be
rarely used. ``In most situations ... we would expect NATO to be fully
engaged,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Noting that some skepticism has been expressed on Capitol Hill about
U.S.-European cooperation in future world trouble spots, Hoon told reporters in
a session at the British Embassy that the lead of European readiness for Kosovo
``demonstrated beyond doubt that Europe was not pulling its weight effectively
in defense terms.''
</P>
<P>
	   Britain has a key role in keeping a bridge between Europe and the United
States and will not do anything to jeopardize its deep friendship with America,
Hoon said.
</P>
<P>
	   He met with Defense Secretary William Cohen on Tuesday but had to cancel a
trip to visit military facilities in Norfolk, Va., because of a severe snow
storm that shut down federal offices for a second day Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One problems in Europe is that too many countries are still organized to
face the threat of the Soviet Union,'' he said, noting Europe's ability to
deploy a large infantry force to deploy against a force from the East was ``no
longer helpful.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hoon also discussed formation of a British-French force that could include
other European troops and would be ready to respond to conflicts where NATO as a
whole is not engaged. ``We are confident this does not in any way jeopardize our
relationship with the United States through NATO,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoon denied that NATO, which includes the United States, is becoming less
relevant and the European Union more relevant in developing European defense
policies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``NATO remains the main source of protection for alliance members,'' he
said, adding there would be ``no diversion from that central commitment.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hoon said any multinational military operation becomes ``a coalition of the
willing'' and even if a strictly European force were deployed, all NATO members
would be involved in decisions and planning leading to the deployment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The idea that in the modern world a situation could arise somewhere in the
world in which Europeans hunkered down together and decided that they were going
to quite secretly and independently determine a response without involvement of
the United States, I just don't find very realistic,'' Hoon said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't believe that the arrangements proposed would have that
possibility,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Frees Four Opposition Figures  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuban police freed at least four opposition figures after
detaining them for most of a day, warning them against trying to form a
coordinated movement, one of the men said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Hector Palacios said the detentions seemed aimed at preventing a meeting of
about 18 opposition figures planned at his house. The people had planned to
discuss how they might act on an opposition document issued Nov. 12, Palacios
said.
</P>
<P>
	   That document, titled ``All United,'' urged Cubans to peacefully work for
greater civil, social and economic rights, including political pluralism and the
right to own businesses. All of Cuba's opposition groups are small, and any
efforts to expand them are hindered by the government.
</P>
<P>
	   Palacios said he was told ``that we are not authorized to take any action
that implies coordination among opposition groups, that implies meetings, that
we can think what we want as individuals but we cannot express what we want to
others.''
</P>
<P>
	   Palacios and at least three other opposition figures were detained by police
Tuesday morning, questioned at a police facility, then released in the afternoon
or evening. Palacios said he was held from 6 a.m. to about 4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Two other dissidents were either restricted to their homes or summoned to
appear at a police station later, according to Elizardo Sanchez, a human rights
activist who tracks arrests of possible political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
	   The best-known of those affected by Tuesday's actions were Palacios, head of
the Democratic Solidarity Party, and Oswaldo Paya Sardinas, head of the
Christian Liberation Movement. Both met last year with Spanish Prime Minister
Jose Maria Aznar and with Illinois Gov. George Ryan, and complained that the
Cuban government does not allow them freedom of speech or assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   Also detained were Palacios' wife, Gisela Delgado, who heads a feminist
organization, and Jose Antonio Bridon, involved in a Christian labor group.

<HEADLINE> Lobbying group says spending cap won't affect emergency aid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Connecticut's cities and towns should not worry
that the state's spending cap will block emergency aid, a lobbying group for
state municipalities said Wednesday.
<P>
	   The governor and lawmakers quickly backed up that assessment.
</P>
<P>
	   "There have been concerns raised that the cap will prevent the state from
spending money on needy towns," said Jim Finley, a spokesman for the Connecticut
Conference of Municipalities. "But there is flexibility under the cap."
</P>
<P>
	   The biennial budget, which runs through the 2000-01 fiscal year, is $23.7
billion. It includes $11.6 billion in spending during the first year and $12.1
billion during the second.
</P>
<P>
	   Marc Ryan, budget director for Gov. John G. Rowland, said that budget cuts
are necessary to keep the state under the spending cap. Rowland spokesman Dean
Pagani said $150 million would have to be shaved to keep the budget $100 million
under the cap.
</P>
<P>
	   But that cap won't choke off money to towns caught in a pinch.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the spending cap law, emergency aid is not cut off to municipalities
that may have a high unemployment rate or a tax base loss, Pagani said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, the cap does not directly limit how much the state pays into its Rainy
Day Fund, nor does it affect capital spending. Money for capital projects comes
from bonds authorized by the Legislature, rather than appropriations they make.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin Sullivan said towns that need help will
get it.
</P>
<P>
	   "The spending cap is only an operative issue at the point of appropriation
when we vote on the budget," said Sullivan, D-West Hartford. "There is nothing
hard and fast about this."

<HEADLINE> Grandmothers Eager for Elian Visit  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- The grandmothers of Elian Gonzalez arrived Wednesday for the
government-ordered meeting with the 6-year-old Cuban boy they have not seen in
more than two months.
</P>
<P>
	   Mariela Quintana and Raquel Rodriquez arrived at Opa-locka Airport just
after 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   They were expected to be taken by helicopter to the meeting at the Miami
Beach home of Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, president of Barry University. Her home
was chosen as a neutral site in the tug of war between the boy's Cuban and
Cuban-American relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, meanwhile, political maneuvering intensified over legislation
to make the little shipwreck survivor, whose mother died in the attempt to get
from Cuba to Florida, a U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
	   The two women made an impassioned appeal to Congress on Tuesday not to pass
such a bill, saying Elian was a Cuban citizen and belonged with his father and
them in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's our right to see our grandson and take him back home,'' Mrs.
Quintana, the child's paternal grandmother, said during a visit to Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   They won't be able to do that when they see Elian late this afternoon in
Miami Beach, however. The meeting was to be just a visit, set up the Immigration
and Naturalization Service after efforts by the grandmothers to see their
grandson in Miami on Monday fell through.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque demanded during a visit to Moscow
today that the boy be returned, accusing the United States of violating his
human rights. Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov also has endorsed the idea of
returning the boy.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite no prospect of taking Elian with them, his Cuban grandmothers still
looked forward to the visit.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rabbis Reject 'Shared Israel'  </HEADLINE>
   By JULIA LIEBLICH AP Religion Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The leadership of Orthodox and Conservative rabbis issued a
rare joint statement Tuesday rejecting a recent proposal by other rabbis that
Jerusalem be shared with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rabbinical Assembly, representing 1,500 Conservative rabbis, and the
Rabbinical Council of America, representing 1,100 Orthodox rabbis, called
Jerusalem ``the united and indivisible capital solely of the State of Israel.''
Reform leadership declined to sign the statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The rabbinic debate began last week, when 314 Reform, Reconstructionist, and
Conservative rabbis signed a statement advising Israel to share sovereignty over
Jerusalem with the Palestinians. The move was apparently timed with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat's meeting with President Clinton to discuss the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordan in 1967 and united it with the
Jewish western half. Israelis say they will never relinquish east Jerusalem,
while Palestinians want it to be the capital of their planned state.
</P>
<P>
	   Rabbi Steven Dworken, executive vice president of the Rabbinical Council of
America, said Tuesday that the suggestion that Jerusalem be shared was poorly
timed in light of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Both sides have committed to discuss the issue. A statement by Jewish
religious leaders weakening Israel's hand is really an unwise thing to do,''
Dworken said. ``The fact that the Rabbinical Council of America and the
Rabbinical Assembly got together shows you how strongly we feel. It doesn't
happen every day -- nor every month.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last week's statement was issued by the Jewish Peace Lobby, which for a
decade has urged Israel to make concessions to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The question is whether the pursuit of both justice and lasting peace
requires that, in some form, Jerusalem be shared with the Palestinian people,''
the statement said. ``We believe that it does.''
</P>
<P>
	   The group's founder, Jerome Segal, a research scholar at the University of
Maryland's Center of International and Security Studies, believes the rabbis'
dispute foreshadows a major upheaval in Israel over Jerusalem's status.

	   MIAMI (AP) -- The grandmothers of Elian Gonzalez arrived Wednesday for the

</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know if I'll cry or if I'll laugh'' when seeing Elian for the
first time in more than two months, Mrs. Rodriquez, Elian's maternal
grandmother, told CNN Tuesday after the INS ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, said today the grandmothers recalled in
their meeting with lawmakers that when Elian was rescued from the Atlantic on
Nov. 25, ``he was able to give his father's name and telephone number.''
</P>
<P>
	   One of the father's relatives, Jackson Lee said on ABC's ``Good Morning
America,'' called another relative ``and said go to the hospital and take care
of him overnight and make sure he gets back home.''
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton supported the grandmothers' cause, hinting he might veto
the citizenship legislation if it passes. And those in the Senate seeking
Elian's repatriation to Cuba suggested they might use delaying tactics,
including a filibuster, to keep the Senate from debating the measure.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The idea that the Senate and the House of Representatives is going to
determine the fate of a 6-year-old is pathetic,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian belongs with his father and grandmothers, Dodd said. ``We can have
good families in bad countries,'' he said after a meeting with the grandmothers.
``This is a good family.''
</P>
<P>
	   The snowstorm that gripped Washington, as well as much of the Atlantic
seaboard, and the rising combativeness of those opposing the citizenship bill
prompted Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., to put off trying to bring
the measure up until next week.
</P>
<P>
	   Lott earlier had said it could come up as early as today.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS, which is part of the Justice Department, announced late Tuesday
that Elian's Florida family had agreed to today's visit. Earlier in the day the
INS had said it had the authority to order the family to agree to the meeting
under the arrangement by which the boy has been allowed to stay in this country
pending further immigration proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The meeting will take place at the time and site selected by the
Immigration Service,'' Justice spokeswoman Carole Florman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Florman said the government had reassured the relatives that today's meeting
at the Miami Beach home of the president of a Dominican college would be just a
visit and would not result in Elian's being taken back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers will see Elian privately, but the boy's Florida relatives
will be nearby in the house at the time, Florman said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Miami, the lead attorney for Elian's relatives, Spencer Eig, said,
``Elian has stated that he's a little bit afraid to go all by himself because
he's afraid they might be forced to take him back to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said today's visit was expected to last two hours and called the INS
``heavy handed'' in its dealings.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS has ruled that the boy should be returned to his father in Cuba.
Elian's Florida relatives have challenged the order in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy was found clinging to a life preserver in the Atlantic on
Thanksgiving Day after his mother and 10 others died when their boat sank en
route from Cuba to the United States. His parents were divorced.
</P>
<P>
	   Versions of the citizenship bill are before both the House and the Senate.
Backers say the boy would have a better life in the United States than in
communist Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The measure, drafted by members of the Florida congressional delegation,
would confer U.S. citizenship on Elian, thus removing the INS jurisdiction from
the case.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Law Bans Discrimination  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE COHEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- South Africa's Parliament, once the rubber
stamp for apartheid legislation, came full circle Wednesday when its upper house
approved a law banning unfair discrimination.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill will outlaw all forms of prejudice based on race, gender, sexual
persuasion, disability and other grounds. If approved by the lower house and
president as expected, the bill also will prohibit hate speech.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our past history of unfair discrimination has left its indelible mark on
South African society,'' Justice Minister Penuell Maduna said when introducing
the legislation in the National Assembly. ``It requires concrete measures to
ensure that human dignity, the achievement of equality, the advancement of human
rights and freedoms, non-racialism and non-sexism become endemic in society.''
</P>
<P>
	   Under the proposal, which is required by the Constitution, people accused of
discrimination will have to prove their innocence and may be ordered to pay
damages. Special equality courts will be set up to deal with complaints.
</P>
<P>
	   The predominantly white opposition Democratic Party voted against the law,
objecting to provisions enabling the justice minister to appoint magistrates and
judges to the equality courts without adequate consultation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We cannot vote for a bill that undermines the Constitution,'' said the
party's human rights spokeswoman, Dene Smuts.
</P>
<P>
	   The most vocal critic has been South Africa's insurance industry, which
claims it will enable policy holders to challenge all underwriting decisions and
thus bring large increases in premiums and costs.
</P>
<P>
	   The New National Party, heir of apartheid's architects, said that despite
the bill's weaknesses, it was necessary to address the injustices of the past.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier drafts specifically banned discrimination on the basis of
socioeconomic status and against AIDS victims. These provisions were watered
down after an outcry from business organizations. The government has said it
will consider reinstating them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think these are very crucial grounds on which people are discriminated
against on a daily basis,'' said Thabani Masuku, an analyst with the Institute
for the Democracy in South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Union head: Donohue does not rule out more job actions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Members of the largest state worker union are so
angry at being without a contract that its president said Wednesday he could not
rule out other job actions like the wildcat sick-out by snowplowers last week on
Long Island.
<P>
	   Danny Donohue of the Civil Service Employees Association said he and other
leaders of the union "do not condone the actions of people who put people in
danger." But he said his members believe they are being "dissed" by Gov. George
Pataki.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're dealing with human beings who feel they're being treated
irrationally," Donohue told a joint state Assembly-Senate hearing on Gov. George
Pataki's 2000-01 budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not going to say things won't get worse," he added. "They probably
will."
</P>
<P>
	   More than 300 snowplow operators called in sick during a snowstorm last week
on Long Island. Most eventually reported to work later in the day. Pataki
ordered state investigators to question the workers involved and union leaders
to determine whether the incident represented an illegal strike under the
state's Taylor Law.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said Donohue was using his appearance
Wednesday, and other recent activities, to enhance his chances of being
re-elected president of his union. He is among three candidates for president on
ballots which went out last week to the 77,000 members of the Civil Service
Employees Association who work for the state.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are clearly more interested in posturing for the campaign than they
are in negotiating," McKeon said. "That has been the problem for the last two
months. Union politics has taken the front seat and negotiations have taken the
back seat."
</P>
<P>
	   Donohue and leaders of the next-largest state worker union, the Public
Employees Federation, pleaded with legislators Wednesday to help them win better
contracts from the Pataki administration.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki's latest offer has been for 11 percent wage increases for the
unionized members over four years. The union officials said such a pay increase
is not large enough and said the governor's proposal would force them to pay
more for health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   The unions have been without contracts since April 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're asking for your help," Donohue told legislators. "I'm demanding it on
behalf of your constituents."
</P>
<P>
	   Jane Hallum, secretary-treasurer of the Public Employees Federation, held up
12 $1 bills for legislators to signify what the per-week raise in base salary
would be for her union's members under Pataki's contract offer. She then took
four of the bills away to represent the additional health insurance costs the
contract offer would cost members.
</P>
<P>
	   She then tossed 20 cents in change on a table and told lawmakers that was
the per-hour salary increase Public Employees Federation members were being
offered.
</P>
<P>
	   "With no rationale, this offer can only be taken as an insult," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Donohue told reporters that it would cost the state about $122
million more to meet his union's contract demands. In a state budget of about
$77 billion as Pataki is proposing - with the state holding billions of dollars
in reserves - $122 million is "chump change," the union president said.
</P>
<P>
	   State legislators have generally not supported his members the way the union
expects, Donohue said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't see them back in the community standing up," Donohue said. "We
hear, 'Well, gee, we're behind you.' We hear these plaudits every now and then.
We want them physically standing up, writing letters, supporting our people."
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, the head of Pataki's Office of Employee Relations, Linda Angello,
told legislators that progress was actually being made on some issues related to
new contracts with the two unions. But salary levels and health benefits remain
stumbling blocks, she conceded.
</P>
<P>
	   Donohue, however, said negotiations haven't gone anywhere for months. Asked
by state Sen. Vincent Leibell, R-Rockland, what the status of negotiators were,
Donohue said "they stink."

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Plans To Cut 6,000 Jobs  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN BACHMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Coca-Cola will shed more than a fifth of its work force,
eliminating 6,000 jobs in a reorganization aimed at reducing the powers of its
Atlanta headquarters and freeing managers around the world to make the best
decisions on how to sell more soda.
</P>
<P>
	   The job cuts announced Wednesday -- the largest in the 113-year-history of
the world's largest soft-drink maker -- will affect 2,500 positions at the
company's Atlanta headquarters, 800 elsewhere in the United States and 2,700
outside the country.
</P>
<P>
	   "The world in which we operate has changed dramatically, and we must change
to succeed," said Coke's new president, Doug Daft, who already has moved quickly
to reshape the ranks of management before he assumes the job of chairman and
chief executive in April.
</P>
<P>
	   "We must think local and act local, taking our business to where our
business is. This will allow us to sell more products," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The job cuts, which are expected to be completed in March, represent about
21 percent of the company's 29,000-person global work force and 40 percent of
the 6,200 jobs in Atlanta. Most of the cuts are in back-office functions, rather
than in producing and marketing soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, employee compensation and benefits work will be contracted out,
as will plant and office maintenance.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody's walking around stunned," said Kevin Hundley, a computer
programmer in Atlantawho has worked for Coke for 18 months. "Everybody's finding
out today, but I think it's something they need to do."
</P>
<P>
	   The company is struggling to improve profits after enduring a string of
setbacks during the last 18 months, including a severe economic downturn in
Asian markets, a costly product recall in Europe and a discrimination lawsuit
filed by a group of minority employees in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   Coke estimated that the job cuts will save $300 million a year but said
earnings would be reduced by $800 million before taxes this year to the cover
costs of the realignment. Displaced workers will be offered severance packages,
outplacement and counseling, Coke said.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement came as Coca-Cola separately reported fourth-quarter
earnings that slightly exceeded Wall Street expectations. But Coke shares fell
more than 4 percent in heavy trading on expectations that short-term profits
would be squeezed as the company reduced shipments of soft-drink concentrate to
bottlers to better manage inventories, said Caroline Levy, an analyst with
Schroder and Co.
</P>
<P>
	   In late trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Coke shares were down $2.68
3/4 at $63.18 3/4 a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Coca-Cola had a loss of $45 million, or 2 cents a share, in the last three
months of 1999, compared with a profit of $597 million, or 24 cents a share, in
the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   The fourth-quarter loss included 33 cents per share in one-time charges,
including writeoffs in Russia and the Baltic states. Excluding the extraordinary
factors, Coke earned 31 cents per share and that was a penny higher than the 30
cents a share that Wall Street expected.
</P>
<P>
	   Quarterly revenue rose 11 percent to $4.9 billion from $4.5 billion a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, Coke's earnings tumbled 31 percent to $2.43 billion, or 98
cents a share, from $3.53 billion, or $1.42 a share, in 1998. In addition to the
writeoffs, the decline reflected the lost sales and cost of European recalls
last year after a product contamination scare.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue rose to $19.8 billion from $18.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, Daft conceded that the European
recall showed that the company was not well-suited to react quickly and that
local officials were not autonomous enough.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a wake-up call for us," he said. "We looked at ourselves very
closely as a result of it, and obviously have made some changes in the way we
will do business. We will do business understanding the environment."
</P>
<P>
	   The size of the cuts surprised many analysts who had predicted Coke would
trim 2,000 to 4,000 jobs. Daft said the 6,000 figure was chosen after a
six-month review of the company's entire operation.
</P>
<P>
	   The job cuts are the latest in a series of management shuffles engineered by
Daft, who became president Dec. 5 when Chairman and CEO M. Douglas Ivester
stunned employees and analysts by announcing he would retire after Coke's annual
shareholders' meeting in April.
</P>
<P>
	   Doug Lane, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, said Daft's shift of
decision-making powers to local managers stemmed from the three decades he spent
with Coke's Asian operations.
</P>
<P>
	   "You've really got to go with management on this one," Lane said. "It's
obvious that he's very passionate about decentralizing responsibility. He is
emphatic that this is a local business, that you have to mix the global brands
with the local brands."

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed today, as cautious investors
weighed strong corporate earnings reports against fears of a pending interest
rate hike.
</P>
<P>
	   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
26.29 at 11,056.18.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 3.39 at 1,406.64, and the Nasdaq composite index was off 49.35 at 4,118.06.
</P>
<P>
	   Market analysts said congressional testimony today by Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Alan Greenspan gave investors few signals about the direction Fed
policy makers are likely to take when they meet to discuss interest rates next
week.
</P>
<P>
	   "Investors were cautious in anticipation of Greenspan's testimony, which
might have given them an indication of where interest rates are going. But he
didn't say anything investors could latch on to one way or the other," said Paul
McEnroe, a trader at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Corporate earnings have proven strong so far. Nonetheless, some well-known
technology companies were punished Wednesday for not living up to investors'
extraordinary expectations for the sector.
</P>
<P>
	   A case in point was cellular phone chipmaker Qualcomm, down 23 1/16 to 125
15/16. Despite beating analysts' earnings estimates by a penny, the company
warned Tuesday that sales may be off this quarter. Investors promptly punished
the company, driving the stock down nearly 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   And software maker and network storage company EMC Corp. fell despite
reporting fourth-quarter earnings of 34 cents a share, excluding a one-time
charge related to an acquisition. The figure beat Wall Street analysts'
estimates of 31 cents a share but the company reported lower-than-expected
revenues for an important segment of its business, causing investors to flee.
</P>
<P>
	   McEnroe said it appeared as if some investors were rotating money out of
newer technology stocks into more established companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Consider Corning, up 5 1/2 at 156 3/4, and Merrill Lynch, up 6 3/4 at 87
7/16.
</P>
<P>
	   "Overall, the market is going through a recovery after several down
sessions," said Ricky Harrington, a technical analyst with Wachovia Securities
in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said President Clinton's State of the Union address, slated for
Thursday, was also making investors cautious.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 892 million shares, up from 861 million
shares yesterday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index was up 0.68 at 522.27.

<HEADLINE> Chile Glass House Attracts Crowds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Daniela Tobar woke up Wednesday, walked to the
bathroom, undressed and took a shower -- as scores of people watched.
</P>
<P>
	   The 21-year-old actress is spending two weeks in a house in central Santiago
made of nothing but glass, part of a project designed to gauge how the public
feels about a person's right to privacy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The idea is for her to live a completely normal life,'' said architect
Arturo Torres, who developed the idea with a colleague. ``We want to show a way
of life which is unusual.''
</P>
<P>
	   Scores of people gather along the sidewalk each day, gawking as Tobar does
laundry, cleans, eats, receives visitors -- even goes to the bathroom. Every
corner of the 8-foot-by-8-foot structure can be seen from the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As I stepped out of bed, the crowd starting chanting, 'Undress,'
Undress!''' she complained.
</P>
<P>
	   Torres said the project cost about $23,000. Half the money was contributed
by Fondart, a government cultural agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Tobar began living in the house on Monday. Police visited her late Tuesday,
suggesting the project be stopped. But Torres said he told them that ``we had
all the necessary permits.'' A City Hall spokesman confirmed that.
</P>
<P>
	   Five pro-government legislators issued a statement supporting the project as
``an exercise of freedom of expression.''

<HEADLINE> Key witness faces cross-examination in land claim damages trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - A state attorney spent Wednesday trying to
undermine the methods used by a federal government real estate appraiser who
says New York owes $335 million to the Cayuga Indian Nation for its lost
ancestral lands.
<P>
	   Assistant Attorney General David Roberts also tried to cast doubt on the
qualifications of Arvel M. Hale, the key witness for the Cayugas, who are
seeking compensation for 64,015 acres of their former territory in Seneca and
Cayuga counties that was illegally acquired by New York in 1795 and 1807.
</P>
<P>
	   Hale had told the jury he determined that $264.7 million was the current
fair-market value of the land by using a market comparison approach, one of
three commonly accepted appraisal methods.
</P>
<P>
	   Hale has testified that he collected information on the current uses of
nearly 5,700 parcels of land to derive an average per-acre price for different
classes of property, which he then used to come up with a total value for the
64,015-acre tract.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts insisted that Hale simply added up the value of each parcel, an
unacceptable practice according to professional standards because typically
per-acre cost shrinks as the size of the parcel increases.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts asked how Hale's method qualified as a market comparison approach,
in which an appraiser looks at other similar sales.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you valued this as a single tract, what other comparable sized parcel
did you look at trying to reach a value on this 64,000 acre tract?" Roberts
asked.
</P>
<P>
	   "I found that there were no other 64,000 acre tracts," Hale answered.
</P>
<P>
	   "So instead of looking at a comparable sized tract, you looked at 5,700 sub
parcels and added them up, correct?," Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts also suggested that Hale's method was misleading because it did not
make any adjustments based on parcel size, topography, zoning or other factors.
The appraisers were instructed by the court to not consider any improvements to
the land, such as buildings or other structures.
</P>
<P>
	   After questioning Hale's methods, Roberts tried to cast doubts about the
appraiser's qualifications. Although Hale has more than 30 years experience as a
real estate appraiser, Roberts asked about his failure to become certified by
the Appraisal Institute, a professional organization that provides training and
standards for appraisers.
</P>
<P>
	   Hale testified he had completed "most or all of the courses" required for
the recognition but that he never took the final examination or submitted
required sample appraisals. Roberts did not allow Hale to offer an explanation
and quickly moved on to a different topic.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Roberts questioned Hale about the appraiser's use of his two adult
daughters to help him research historical deeds. Roberts suggested that neither
woman was qualified and asked Hale what precautions he took to make sure they
did not make mistakes.
</P>
<P>
	   "I did not have a way to double-check their work but I have confidence in
their accuracy," Hale said.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts also tried to dispute Hale's rental value of $70.4 million. The
Cayugas are seeking rent for the use and occupancy of the land over two
centuries as well as compensation for its present-day worth.
</P>
<P>
	   Hale has said he derived that figure by taking 6 percent of the land's
fair-market value for each of the 204 years. The state's appraiser, who will
testify that the Cayugas should receive no more than $41 million, used 2 percent
in his rent calculations.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of a lack of rent records, Hale said he used other information in
deciding upon the 6 percent figure. However, his report to the court cited an
example that Roberts questioned him about: an 1801 lease agreement on a 600-acre
farm that set forth an annual rent of $75 with an option to buy for $2,400.
</P>
<P>
	   The rental charge amounts to a little more than 3 percent of the $2,400,
which Roberts suggested was the land's fair-market value at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   Hale said he used the 1801 lease only as an example and said he found other
records that convinced him his 6 percent figure was correct. However, he
acknowledged that he did not document any of those sources in his report.
</P>
<P>
	   Testimony continues Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Gene ID'd in Spinal Cord Injuries  </HEADLINE>
    By JEFF BARNARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Scientists have identified a gene that prevents the brain and spinal cord
from rewiring themselves after an injury, pointing the way to new treatments
that might someday help paralyzed "Superman" star Christopher Reeve and 250,000
Americans like him.
</P>
<P>
	   Dubbed "Nogo" because of its inhibiting effect, the gene produces a protein
that prevents nerve-cell connections in the central nervous system from
regenerating after they are cut. Experiments in rats showed that when the
protein is blocked, the spinal cord can repair itself.
</P>
<P>
	   Neurologists hailed the work as a landmark step. But they cautioned that
other factors may also inhibit nerve regrowth.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is important not to give patients false hope," said Dr. Ben Barres, a
professor of neurology at Stanford University. "But I think there are a lot of
grounds for optimism now."
</P>
<P>
	   The findings were reported in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature by
scientists in Switzerland, England and the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   If the scientists are right, they have solved an old mystery: Why can't
connections in the central nervous system -- the brain and spinal cord -- repair
themselves, when connections in the peripheral nervous system -- everything else
-- can?
</P>
<P>
	   The answer is that Nogo is present in the central nervous system but not the
other nerves. Nogo may exist to hardwire the brain and spinal cord -- or fix
them in place -- after they have developed, and prevent them from going wild.
</P>
<P>
	   A team led by Martin Schwab of the Brain Research Institute at the
University of Zurich in Switzerland has been working on Nogo for 15 years, and
created an antibody that blocks the Nogo-created protein.
</P>
<P>
	   In test-tube experiments, nerves dissected from rats were exposed to the
antibody. The nerves regrew several hundred nerve connections known as axons, or
the tiny branches that transmit impulses from one nerve cell to the next, Schwab
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   In an additional set of experiments that were not published in Nature,
Schwab's team said it partially cut the spinal cords of rats, paralyzing the
animals, then gave the rodents the antibody for two weeks. The nerves regrew,
and the animals resumed normal activities such as grabbing food pellets and
climbing a rope.
</P>
<P>
	   "We see these animals' recovery functionally," said Isabel Klusman, a
medical biologist who works with Schwab.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers said the Nogo research may lead to a three-pronged therapy
involving a Nogo blocker, some agent to boost nerve growth, and some kind of
cell transplant.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwab's team never identified the actual gene. That was done by two
separate teams, one at the pharmaceutical company SmithKline Beecham in England,
the other led by Dr. Stephen Strittmatter at Yale University.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 11,000 people injure their spinal cords each year, primarily in car
wrecks, as football star Derrick Thomas did last Sunday. Reeve has been
paralyzed from the neck down, using a respirator to help him breathe, since a
1995 fall from a horse.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers are more cautious than Reeve, but the actor, whose foundation
helped finance some of the Nogo research at Yale, said the discoveries are part
of a growing body of advances that he believes will allow him to walk again
someday.
</P>
<P>
	   Reeve said he hopes to take part in human tests by Schwab in about five
years, once work has progressed to the point he would feel safe.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will be a question of money and time," Reeve said from his office in
Bedford, N.Y. "But the field now is very alive and there is suddenly a lot of
progress being made."

<HEADLINE> Hastert Faces 2nd-Year Challenges  </HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER LOVEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The third man on the dais at Thursday night's State of
the Union address with President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore is not a
household name, yet he's confronting as big a battle this election year.
</P>
<P>
	   While Clinton tries to establish a legacy beyond impeachment and Gore
campaigns to succeed him in the White House, Speaker Dennis Hastert is
struggling to keep a fragile, ideologically fractured Republican majority -- and
himself -- in charge of the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He faces a challenge that is perhaps the greatest challenge faced by a
speaker'' in decades, said Ross Baker, a congressional expert, who is on
sabbatical from Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
	   The daunting task demands that Hastert produce a voter-pleasing legislative
agenda and squeeze it through the House with only 11 Republicans to spare. He
also must maintain a dizzying fund-raising schedule made all the more important
by GOP retirements that have raised Democratic hopes of regaining control.
</P>
<P>
	   Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist, isn't sure
Hastert is up to the job.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No one knows. He's only been in office one year,'' Sabato said.
</P>
<P>
	   In typical low-key fashion, Hastert, 58, expressed modest but firm
confidence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All of it is kind of having a game plan and sticking with it,'' he said in
a telephone interview from Tucson, Ariz., where he was rounding out a nine-day
Western swing collecting cash for Republican candidates. ``Nothing is easy in
this business. But I think we have a pretty good agenda.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was slightly more than a year ago that the seven-term conservative from
farm country west of Chicago took the speaker's gavel. The move came after a
stunning series of events related to President Clinton's impeachment plucked
Hastert from obscurity, leading some to dub him ``the accidental speaker.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert's first-year performance received mixed reviews.
</P>
<P>
	   He won passage of a massive tax cut, then saw that achievement vetoed by
Clinton amid little public support for the idea.
</P>
<P>
	   He was criticized for a lack of leadership after he failed to line up GOP
support for a resolution supporting U.S. intervention in Kosovo and gun-control
measures, despite personally supporting both. That gave Democrats ammunition to
advance their favorite claim: that Hastert is decent but ineffective and bends
to the wishes of the combative majority whip, Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert did notch some important wins.
</P>
<P>
	   Most notably, Republicans won at least partial victory in an end-of-year
budget deal negotiated with Clinton. Hastert also received credit for holding
Republicans together on the well-received message that Social Security money was
not spent to fund other federal programs.
</P>
<P>
	   In the end, Hastert remained popular and unchallenged, and the talk of
DeLay's influence mostly subsided.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, Republicans need to counter the Democrats' promised all-out offensive
on health care reform, gun control and a minimum-wage increase with their own
alternatives, while also promoting a minimal slate of GOP proposals,
Congress-watchers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Keeping the list short to avoid missteps -- and to give Democrats as few
opportunities as possible -- is key, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, Hastert and his leadership team laid out a modest agenda
including a smaller tax-cut package, attacks on wasteful government spending,
erasing the national debt by 2015 and a focus on trade and technology.
</P>
<P>
	   Another crucial mission for Hastert is boosting flagging GOP morale, evident
in the retirement so far of 22 Republicans -- compared with only six Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   With his plodding, consensus-building style, Hastert is most vulnerable if
an issue springs up suddenly and careens out of his control, political
scientists agree.
</P>
<P>
	   Marshall Wittmann, director of congressional relations for the conservative
Heritage Foundation, warned that with so much at stake Hastert must be cautious
at every turn.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His watchword should be, 'Do no harm,''' Wittmann said. ``Mischief is his
enemy.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Hastert discounted the concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We learned from our mistakes before,'' he said. ``You just have to get
your work done and everything else flows from that.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Rep. accuses Mrs. Clinton of appropriating jet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton's air travel again came under
fire on Wednesday, this time from a Republican congressman who says the first
lady appropriated an Air Force jet he had reserved for a fact-finding mission.
<P>
	   Rep. Cass Ballenger, R-N.C., said his delegation was forced to fly two small
Air Force planes to Latin America rather than the one larger plane he had
reserved in December. Instead, Mrs. Clinton was given the 14-seat Gulfstream jet
to fly to New York last week, Ballenger said. There she made campaign
appearances in New York City and Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result of the Congressional delegation being forced to fly two planes,
taxpayers were billed thousands of dollars in extra costs, Ballenger said. The
trip ended Jan. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   "It tees me off that here we were on legitimate United States business
important to the country ... and yet she gets the plane for her own political
purposes," Ballenger said Wednesday. "It doesn't seem fair to me."
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton's campaign spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said Ballenger's
information was wrong, but said he could not elaborate because he is restricted
from discussing issues affecting the first lady's security.

<HEADLINE> Casinos May Aid Child Support Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By SONYA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is hoping to put the squeeze on parents
who owe billions of dollars in child support payments by seizing large jackpots
won at casinos or dog races by deadbeat dads and moms.
</P>
<P>
	   In his fiscal 2001 budget plan, Clinton is proposing that gambling
establishments check to see if their big winners owe child support, and withhold
the winnings if they do. The White House estimated Wednesday that this maneuver
alone could bring in $348 million over five years.
</P>
<P>
	   But the idea has met resistance on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This does not pass my smell test,'' said Rep. Shelley Berkley, D-Nev.
``This is a proposal that sets a dangerous precedent, by adding a federal burden
to an industry that is already regulated. The gaming industry should not become
an arm of the federal government, not for this laudatory endeavor or anything
else.''
</P>
<P>
	   The gambling provision is one of several items in Clinton's budget seeking
to collect $2 billion in back child support in the next five years. The largest
amount, $1.2 billion, is expected to come through streamlining rules governing
distribution of child support to ensure that more of the money goes directly to
families.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides collecting gambling purses, the remainder of the child support
payments were to be gathered through efforts from booting the cars of delinquent
parents to providing funds to give job training to nonworking fathers who could
support their children if they were employed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We view this as the next big step in welfare reform,'' said Bruce Reed,
Clinton's domestic policy adviser. ``We've put mothers to work, but they
shouldn't bear the whole burden. Fathers should go to work and support their
children as well.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton will highlight the fathers' job-training program in his State of the
Union address Thursday night, Reed said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's budget plan sets aside $125 million for one year to assist
40,000 low-income noncustodial parents -- primarily fathers -- in finding work,
meeting support payments and re-establishing relationships with their children.
The program builds on $350 million in fatherhood initiatives operating under
welfare-to-work efforts at the Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House announced the child support initiative as it released new
data showing child support collections nearly doubled between 1992 and 1999,
from $8 billion to $15.5 billion. About $1.3 billion of that money was collected
by withholding federal income tax refunds, the White House said. The rest came
from steps such as garnishing wages, seizing bank accounts and capturing
driver's or other licenses.
</P>
<P>
	   The gambling proposal would apply to winnings through casinos, dog racing,
jai alai or keno but not lotteries, which are covered under current law. Casinos
or other gambling establishments would determine whether a winning patron owes
child support as they go through procedures for withholding federal income taxes
from their jackpots.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the simplified collection rules, states would be given incentives if
they allow custodial parents to keep all the child support paid for their
children if they leave welfare, or keep up to $100 a month if they are in the
process of leaving welfare for work.
</P>
<P>
	   Other methods Clinton is proposing for collecting child support include:
</P>
<P>
	   --Placing a boot on the cars of parents who have failed to pay. A pilot
program in Virginia successfully collected an average of $5,000 from each
delinquent parent. The White House estimated this would enable states to collect
$183 million over five years.
</P>
<P>
	   --Denying passports to parents who owe at least $2,500 in child support.
This would tighten a current program under which passport applications or
renewals are rejected for parents who are $5,000 in arrears. The White House
estimated it would generate $36 million in additional child support payments.

<HEADLINE> Four federally protected trumpeter swans found dead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALABAMA, N.Y. (AP) - At least four trumpeter swans among a group being
trained to migrate to wintering grounds in Maryland have been killed.
<P>
	   Hunters reported seeing one of the swans shot down over a marsh on Nov. 7,
the day after Canada goose hunting season began. Three more were found piled up
in a dike Jan. 7, and shotgun pellet marks were spotted on one of their collars,
state conservation officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's unfortunate because there is no hunting of swans allowed in New York,"
said Donielle Rininger, chief biologist of a restoration project attempting to
teach the swans to migrate each year from upstate New York to Chesapeake Bay in
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
	   "The first swan could have been considered misidentification by a goose
hunter. Gross misidentification. The three birds in the pile was a vandalistic
act," she said in Wednesday's Daily News of Batavia.
</P>
<P>
	   The federally protected waterfowl, the largest flying birds in North
America, were on the verge of extinction in the 1930s. While their numbers have
replenished there is concern that the birds have lost their ability to properly
migrate.
</P>
<P>
	   Rininger and other biologists from Warrenton, Va., began their project in
September 1998 when they trucked 20 birds to a game farm in this village 45
miles west of Rochester. Only 13 were later deemed strong enough to make the
flight south behind an ultralight aircraft.
</P>
<P>
	   Two birds were injured when they collided with plane propellers. The others
had to be trucked much of the way to Chesapeake Bay, and then back again in the
spring.
</P>
<P>
	   Anyone convicted of shooting a trumpeter swan could draw up to six months in
prison and a $5,000 fine, said U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Special Agent
Ellen Kiley of Buffalo.

<HEADLINE> GOP Rep. accuses Mrs. Clinton of appropriating jet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton's air travel again came under
fire on Wednesday, this time from a Republican congressman who says the first
lady appropriated an Air Force jet he had reserved for a fact-finding mission.
<P>
	   Rep. Cass Ballenger, R-N.C., said his delegation was forced to fly two small
Air Force planes to Latin America rather than the one larger plane he had
reserved in December. Instead, Mrs. Clinton was given the 14-seat Gulfstream jet
to fly to New York last week, Ballenger said. There she made campaign
appearances in New York City and Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result of the Congressional delegation being forced to fly two planes,
taxpayers were billed thousands of dollars in extra costs, Ballenger said. The
trip ended Jan. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   "It tees me off that here we were on legitimate United States business
important to the country ... and yet she gets the plane for her own political
purposes," Ballenger said Wednesday. "It doesn't seem fair to me."
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton's campaign spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said Ballenger's
information was wrong, but said he could not elaborate because he is restricted
from discussing issues affecting the first lady's security.
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign of Mrs. Clinton's most likely rival, New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, wasted no time in attacking the travel, calling on Mrs.
Clinton to reimburse taxpayers for the extra costs involved in the Latin
American trip.

<HEADLINE> Students Open Gate at Mexico Campus  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL WEISSERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Students and faculty broke through barricades at
Mexico's premier university Wednesday in a move against student strikers who
have occupied the campus for nine months.
</P>
<P>
	   Crowds forced open a gate at the 280,000-student National Autonomous
University's campus in Mexico City and tore down wire and poles, allowing
hundreds of people to enter. Strike leaders elsewhere at the campus maintained
their barricades intact.
</P>
<P>
	   Strikers at a science building near the opened gate appeared surprised by
the crowd. Some attempted to leave the campus but were blocked by anti-strike
protesters who linked hands.
</P>
<P>
	   The action came one day after the university's rector, Juan Ramon de la
Fuente, went to the campus to deliver results of a referendum showing
overwhelming support for an end to the walkout. Strikers and a throng of
photographers, however, kept him from reaching the barricaded gates.
</P>
<P>
	   In newspaper ads published Wednesday, students who support de la Fuente's
proposal to end the strike urged their supporters to go to the university
Wednesday to confront the hard-line strikers.
</P>
<P>
	   The walkout at the university, popularly known by its Spanish acronym, UNAM,
began in April to protest a plan by de la Fuente's predecessor to increase
annual tuition from a token few cents to the equivalent of $140. Administrators
backed off the fee increase, but strikers' demands grew to include sweeping
policy changes and a call for greater student control.
</P>
<P>
	   The small and increasingly radical group of striking students has rejected
de la Fuente's proposal to end the strike and dismissed as irrelevant results of
the referendum last week, which showed nearly 90 percent of teachers and
students support the rector.
</P>
<P>
	   In his visit to the campus Tuesday, de la Fuente told strikers that
negotiations to end the walkout would only resume when the campus is reopened.
The strikers said they would welcome dialogue -- but not on the campus.

<HEADLINE> Wheat, Corn Lead Darm Crops Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat and corn pulled prices of agricultural
commodities sharply lower Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade
in a retrenchment of recent gains.
</P>
<P>
	   Corn suffered the biggest percentage decline, wiping out two
days' worth of advances and pulling back after month-long gains.
Traders called it a technical decline on a day with little news.
</P>
<P>
	   Corn prices also were influenced by losses in wheat, which dove
early in the session on the prospects of a storm providing more
moisture for the central and southern Plains states -- the heart of
the winter wheat crop.
</P>
<P>
	   Significant snowfall and freezing rain are expected in the
region overnight, which would help winter wheat.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybeans declined under pressure from wheat and corn and as a
result of forecasts for continued rain in Brazil's northern soybean
belt, as well as weekend showers in southern Brazil.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat for March delivery fell 4 3/4 cents to $2.60 a bushel; March
corn fell 4 1/2 cents to $2.23 a bushel; March oats fell 1 1/2 cents to

<HEADLINE> Versailles Wants To Replant Forests  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- France's most famous chateau has launched an international
campaign to fund the replanting of its forests, which were devastated by storms
that swept through Europe in late December.
</P>
<P>
	   About 10,000 trees on the palace grounds at Versailles were uprooted,
toppled or splintered during the deadly storms that hit at Christmastime. Many
of the lost trees were historic, including a Corsican pine planted under
Napoleon and Virginia tulip trees planted by Marie-Antoinette, the Austrian-born
wife of Louis XVI.
</P>
<P>
	   Replanting Versailles' park will cost about $20 million, administrators say.
</P>
<P>
	   The organizing committee for the campaign, which was launched Monday,
includes former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, fashion designer
Pierre Cardin and actor Gregory Peck.
</P>
<P>
	   Versailles is a top tourist attraction, drawing about 9 million visitors a
year. The sprawling 2,000-acre grounds at the palace outside Paris are known for
fountains, calm pathways and geometric gardens.
</P>
<P>
	   The chateau itself, former home to France's royal families, also was damaged
by the storms, but workers quickly repaired broken roof tiles and windows before
much damage could be done to the sumptuous interiors.
</P>
<P>
	   France lost millions of trees during the violent weather that hit Europe at
the end of December. Ninety people were killed in storm-related accidents
nationwide.

<HEADLINE> China Denies Probe of Leader's Wife  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN LEICESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIJING (AP) -- The Chinese government denied Wednesday that the wife of a
senior leader was involved in a multibillion-dollar smuggling scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the government's first public denial of reports that Lin Youfang,
wife of Beijing Communist Party boss Jia Qinglin, was under investigation in
what has been called China's worst smuggling scandal in 50 years of communist
rule.
</P>
<P>
	   Zhao Qizheng, the top spokesman for the State Council, or Cabinet, confirmed
that a 5-month-old investigation into the Xiamen scandal was continuing.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of Chinese officials have come under suspicion in the smuggling of
billions of dollars worth of oil, cars, cigarettes and other goods through
Xiamen, a bustling port facing Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   But Zhao denied widespread reports in Hong Kong and foreign media that Jia,
a protege of Chinese President Jiang Zemin, divorced his wife, Lin, after she
was implicated.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She has not been investigated,'' Zhao told The Associated Press. ``She has
not divorced. She is living very normally, like you and I.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before Zhao's comments, the communist leadership had kept quiet about the
unfolding scandal and ordered a news blackout in the entirely state-controlled
media. But word that Jia's wife was involved has circulated on Chinese Web
sites, edging the scandal into the public eye.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign media had reported that Jia's wife was under arrest. And in China,
the state-run Guangzhou Daily's Web site had reported that Lin was implicated.
</P>
<P>
	   But on Wednesday, the paper's Web site ran another story that quoted
official sources denying her involvement. The story said Lin was Jia's ``worthy
wife.''
</P>
<P>
	   Zhao said he asked ``authoritative departments,'' which he did not name,
about Lin. He said she is living at home and has not been arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   Jia ran the government and Communist Party in Fujian, the province where
Xiamen is located, for several of the years in which the alleged smuggling took
place. A member of the party's powerful 21-member Politburo, Jia is closely
associated with Jiang.
</P>
<P>
	   In a sign of the leadership's continuing confidence in Jia, state-run
television over the past few days has shown him escorting Jiang on a pre-Lunar
New Year tour of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
	   The Guangzhou Daily's Web site reported Tuesday that $9.8 billion worth of
goods had been smuggled through Xiamen and that 159 people were involved. Those
under arrest in the case include the chief of immigration of China's national
police force and several Xiamen party and government officials, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Firefighters angered by 'NYPD Blue' portrayal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The union representing 9,100 firefighters called
Wednesday for a national boycott of the popular ABC television show "NYPD Blue,"
claiming its most recent episode depicted New York's Bravest as grave robbers.
<P>
	   An executive producer for the Emmy-award winning series apologized if the
episode offended anyone but countered that the show is based on reality and has
depicted corrupt police officers several times.
</P>
<P>
	   "These are based on true stories," said Bill Clark, with Steven Bochco
Productions. "It was the first time we portrayed firemen in a bad light."
</P>
<P>
	   Clark added that since the series debuted in 1993, "we've locked up probably
10 cops on the show. ... I've never had the police union call me to boycott."
</P>
<P>
	   ABC, asked for comment, referred calls to Steven Bochco Productions.
</P>
<P>
	   The show Tuesday night featured a firefighter who stole a Rolex watch and a
ring from the body of a dead man. The theft was discovered by Detective Andy
Sipowicz, portrayed by actor Dennis Franz.
</P>
<P>
	   Matthew James, the Brooklyn trustee of the Uniformed Firefighters
Association of Greater New York, watches the show regularly and was dumbfounded
by the latest episode.
</P>
<P>
	   "'NYPD Blue' and ABC Network have spit in the face of every New York City
firefighter and our comrades nationally," he said. "Each and every day these
brave men and women risk life and limb for the citizenry of New York City, and
ABC and 'NYPD Blue' has the audacity to portray us as idiots, criminals, and
worse yet, those who would pillage from a corpse."
</P>
<P>
	   He added that at the same time the show was airing on the East Coast, five
firefighters were seriously injured in a Brooklyn apartment fire that killed two
residents.
</P>
<P>
	   James said that, for the sake of ratings, the show desecrated the memory of
the 771 firefighters who have lost their lives in the line of duty during the
department's history.
</P>
<P>
	   UFA spokesman Tom Butler said more than 100 firefighters called the office
before noon Wednesday to complain about the show.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before 'NYPD Blue' debuted, it has been dogged by criticism, mostly
from conversative groups outraged over the show's use of profanity, violence and
nudity. But the show has remained extremely popular with viewers.

<HEADLINE> Citrus Growers Eye Chinese Market  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL WHITE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- American citrus growers moved a step closer to
cracking China's potentially lucrative market Wednesday after a Chinese
agriculture official gave a thumbs up to U.S. pest control measures.
</P>
<P>
	   But Americans will have to spend some money on promotion and distribution
networks before they can sell many oranges, lemons and grapefruits to China's
1.3 billion consumers, said Xia Hongmin, director general of China's plant and
animal import inspection program.
</P>
<P>
	   "Generally speaking we are satisfied with what we have seen, what we have
heard," said Xia, who has led a team of inspectors through groves and packing
plants in Florida, Texas, Arizona and California.
</P>
<P>
	   The approval is key to opening up China's vast consumer market to U.S.
citrus products, a move growers hope will bring in hundreds of millions of
dollars in new sales. The inspection is one of the last steps to officially
opening the nation's market under an agriculture trade pact reached last spring
after breaking a political logjam brought on by strained U.S.-China relations.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunkist Growers, one of the nation's biggest citrus cooperatives, expects
sales to China to reach $500 million over the next five years for its 6,500
members in Arizona and California.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida agriculture officials have estimated that China citrus trade
eventually could reach $150 million per year.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement is separate from the broader trade deal reached late last year
as a condition to China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Xia declined to provide a date when exports could begin. He and his team
still must return to China and report to the government, and the two countries
must work out logistical procedures, but he said he expected the start of trade
to be "very quick."
</P>
<P>
	   California citrus officials said they hope to begin shipments by April.
</P>
<P>
	   Pest control concerns will be resolved for the most part by the inspection
tour but the United States and China still need to work out procedural issues,
Xia said. The biggest hurdle remaining may be for U.S. growers to find importers
to buy and distribute the product in China.
</P>
<P>
	   Bargain pricing also would help, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "When deciding on the price, you should take into consideration China is a
developing country," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   One analyst warned that shipping citrus and other agriculture products to
China still may not be easy. China has a history of dickering over the
interpretation of treaties, said Greg Mastel, director of the global economic
policy project at the New America Foundation.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. had to issue sanctions against China three times before it made
serious efforts to protect intellectual property rights for products such as
computer software from counterfeiters, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Chinese leaders, he said, are under pressure to protect the interests of
Chinese farmers who could be hurt by such trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nothing will be easy," he said. "But I think agriculture is the most
promising area in the short term."

<HEADLINE> Sprint Sells Stake in Global One  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Sprint is selling its stake in Global One to its
two European partners in the troubled business communications venture, a move
widely expected even before Sprint agreed to be acquired by MCI WorldCom in
October.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom agreed to pay $1.13 billion in cash and
assume $276 million of debt in the deal announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement also calls for the two European companies, each of which owns
a 10 percent stake in Sprint, to vote their shares in favor of the merger with
MCI WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
	   The Global One partnership was launched in 1996 to cater to the global
operations of Fortune 500 companies, providing voice, data and Internet services
in 65 countries. Top rivals include MCI WorldCom, Netherlands-based Unisource
and the Concert joint venture formed between AT&AMP;T and British Telecom.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal with Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom also guarantees that
multinational Sprint customers who use Global One will continue to be served by
the venture for at least two years.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our customers can be assured that Sprint will be able to deliver its
complete line of international products, services and network support despite
the change of ownership in Global One," said William T. Esrey, Sprint's chairman
and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
	   Sprint said the sale of its part in the venture should close within the next
few months.

<HEADLINE> Little To Do in Downtown Atlanta  </HEADLINE>
   By JUSTIN BACHMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- This city is a master at bringing huge events to town: the
1996 Olympics, the 2000 baseball All-Star Game, Sunday's Super Bowl and
countless conventions every year.
</P>
<P>
	   But when the meeting lets out or the event is over, just try to find a good
time around all those downtown hotels and convention centers. The action is in
neighborhoods outside of downtown.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike its competition, Atlanta has no Broadway, no French Quarter, no
dazzling casinos. After dark, downtown has more in common with a Midwest farm
town than an Olympic city.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When I lived there you could shoot a cannon through downtown after 10
o'clock and not hit anybody,'' said Patti Shock, former chairwoman of
hospitality management at Georgia State University and now chairwoman of the
tourism and convention department at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
	   Local partyers generally prescribe Buckhead, a well-to-do enclave five miles
north of downtown with several theme-oriented bars and chain restaurants.
</P>
<P>
	   Downtown, there is Underground Atlanta, a subterranean mall foundering near
bankruptcy. A near-empty Hooters was the only establishment open this week in
Kenny's Alley, a once-bustling collection of bars at Underground.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You get every chucklehead in town saying, `Oh, you've got to go to
Buckhead, you've got to go to Underground,' and then they go away saying,
`That's it? That's Atlanta's downtown?''' said Robert Holland, the city's best
bartender according to a local alternative newspaper reader poll. ``What a
hellish vision of Atlanta (visitors) must have.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mark and Kathryn Carpenter of Jacksonville, Fla., said they had more fun
partying in Miami before last year's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everybody said go to Buckhead, so we went to Buckhead. But we weren't
impressed,'' Mark Carpenter said Wednesday. ``Too many bars and lots of
traffic.''
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at the Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau insist that the city
is a complete entertainment package and that no one cares whether the
socializing occurs downtown or somewhere near it.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides Buckhead, areas such as Little Five Points, east of downtown, and
Virginia-Highland, northeast of downtown, command most of the nightlife.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not talking about sending you an hour away. We're talking about a
five-mile radius of the core city,'' said Bill Howard, the bureau's vice
president of marketing, tourism and communications.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What you really find in Atlanta is not that much dissimilar in what you
find in other major cities,'' he said. ``Atlanta is a city that has a business
district, a convention district, a sports district and a local entertainment
district.''
</P>
<P>
	   Billy Payne, who successfully steered the city's bid for the 1996 Olympics,
argues that the games helped Atlantans rediscover downtown and spurred a
renaissance of urban development. As people return to downtown to live, he said,
nightlife is sure to follow.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The migration back is slow. It's slower than we would all like,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Downtown is dominated by offices and hotels. The Georgia World Congress
Center, Georgia Dome, CNN Center and new Philips Arena sit on the western edge,
while hotels anchor the east side. Centennial Olympic Park, the focal point of
much of the Olympic celebration, has fountains, benches and acres of concrete.
</P>
<P>
	   But visitors coming to town looking for other remnants of the 1996 Olympics
are often disappointed. Many of the venues have been torn down, and the Olympic
Stadium was turned into a baseball park. The cauldron that housed the Olympic
flame didn't fit aesthetically and was moved to the far edge of an outer parking
lot.
</P>
<P>
	   One industry that has thrived near downtown Atlanta is nude dancing. Atlanta
is one of the few cities in the nation that allow completely nude dancers -- no
G-strings or pasties -- and alcohol in the same establishments, and there are
several clubs near downtown that run shuttles to large hotels.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When there's a big show or convention in town, they'll pull up by the
busloads,'' said Sophia, a 31-year-old dancer who gave only her stage name. ``I
guess when these guys get out of town, they feel they can let their hair down. I
have no trouble taking advantage of that.''

<HEADLINE> 4 Westchester guards accused of attacks on female inmates  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HAWTHORNE, N.Y. (AP) - Four veteran guards at the Westchester County
Jail were accused Wednesday of sexual attacks on female inmates, ranging from
rape and sodomy to stripping on demand.
<P>
	   "These acts are acts of intimidation, degradation, humiliation and serious
abuse," said District Attorney Jeanine Pirro.
</P>
<P>
	   County Executive Andrew Spano called the crimes "an abuse of power" and
announced that he was immediately banning male officers from the 10 posts inside
the women prisoners' living quarters, ending a bid-by-seniority system.
</P>
<P>
	   "These things are happening too often at the women's facility," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The sex scandal broke one day after a correction sergeant was convicted of
covering up the fatal beating of a recovering heroin addict by guards at the
Nassau County Jail. Three other Nassau guards had already pleaded guilty in the
federal civil rights case and the Justice Department is investigating the jail.
</P>
<P>
	   The Westchester suspects were arrested Wednesday morning and taken to court
for arraignment. If they don't make bail, they will be imprisoned at some other
jail "for their own safety," said Correction Commissioner Rocco Pozzi.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers were identified as:
</P>
<P>
	   -Carlos Aldarondo, 33, of Larchmont, a 12-year veteran, accused of statutory
rape and sodomy for allegedly engaging in intercourse and oral sex in the cell
of a 30-year-old prisoner.
</P>
<P>
	   -Javier Corona, 31, of Yonkers, accused of statutory rape for allegedly
taking a 32-year-old inmate into a supply closet for intercourse. He has been a
correction officer for nine years.
</P>
<P>
	   -Michael Downey, 39, of Millbrook, accused of official misconduct and sexual
abuse of three prisoners who said he directed them to expose private parts. He
has 12 years on the job.
</P>
<P>
	   -Robert Escalera, 39, another nine-year veteran, accused of official
misconduct for allegedly demanding that a 31-year-old inmate, who was suffering
from a toothache, reveal her sexual parts in exchange for Tylenol. Escalera, who
lives in Yonkers, is also accused of threatening the inmate after she spoke to
investigators.
</P>
<P>
	   The men were suspended with pay, but the pay will end within two days, Pozzi
said. If convicted, Aldarondo and Corona could be sentenced to four years in
prison. Downey and Escalera could get a year on each count.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation began last year when an inmate complained about Downey.
Soon after, her boyfriend wrote to the county executive, the district attorney
and the Correction Department, to make sure her complaint was heard.
Investigators "came across information that seemed to indicate this was
widespread," Spano said.
</P>
<P>
	   A 1996 state law declares that even if sex between a guard and an inmate is
consensual, it is statutory rape because the inmate's subservient position makes
legal consent impossible.
</P>
<P>
	   "They have complete power and control over female inmates," Mrs. Pirro said.
"Inmates are reliant on correction officers for everything from protection to
food to safety to sanitary napkins."
</P>
<P>
	   She said half a dozen county jail officers have already been convicted on
similar sex charges, and "more inmates are coming forward."
</P>
<P>
	   The jail houses women who are either awaiting trial or serving sentences of
up to one year.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will prosecute sexual abuse charges whether the victim is accosted in
the street, in her home or in a criminal facility," Mrs. Pirro said.
</P>
<P>
	   Detective Glenna Lunn of the county police interviewed about 30 women, in
and out of prison, to find victims and witnesses. She said their solidarity,
especially considering the potential for retaliation, was impressive.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were very strong women," she said. "They should be proud of themselves
for coming forward."

<HEADLINE> Russia Opposition Boycott Continues  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM HEINTZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- A top opposition politician said Wednesday that his party has
no immediate plans to end a parliamentary boycott that has entered its second
week.
</P>
<P>
	   But Yevgeny Primakov's comments after meeting with acting President Vladimir
Putin came as the two other factions in the walkout gave signs that the standoff
could end soon.
</P>
<P>
	   Primakov, a former prime minister, leads the centrist Fatherland-All Russia,
one of three factions that walked out of the newly elected parliament's first
session last week to protest a deal between the chamber's two largest groups,
the Communists and Unity, a pro-Kremlin bloc.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the agreement, Communist Gennady Seleznyov was elected parliament
speaker and the two parties divided control of most of the chamber's key posts.
The deal raised questions about Putin's commitment to democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   After his hourlong meeting with Putin, Primakov said he believes the acting
president wants to end the crisis. But he said that if there is no progress, his
party will not attend on Friday, the next meeting of the full parliament, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The liberal Yabloko and Union of Right Forces parties were leaning the other
way.
</P>
<P>
	   Union leader Sergei Kiriyenko met Tuesday with Putin and said the talks
``managed a breakthrough,'' with Unity agreeing to support liberal bills
proposed by his party along with procedural changes to defend the interests of
smaller parties.
</P>
<P>
	   Yabloko leader Grigory Yavlinsky said his party could return to parliament
Feb. 9, Interfax reported, not elaborating on the return date.
</P>
<P>
	   Boris Berezovsky, a business tycoon elected to the Duma as an independent,
defended Unity's alliance with the Communists -- in charge of the previous Duma
-- as a victory of common sense.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unity is more pragmatic,'' he said. ``When there was a need to quickly
solve issues important for the Duma's work, Unity found common language with
Communists.''

<HEADLINE> Jefferson Likely Dad of Slave Child  </HEADLINE>
   By KIA SHANT'E BREAUX Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- More than a year after a DNA test suggested
that Thomas Jefferson had a son by his slave Sally Hemings, the foundation that
owns Jefferson's home acknowledged that he probably was the father of one, if
not all six, of her children.
</P>
<P>
	   The Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation, which owns Monticello, released
its findings Wednesday in response to an October 1998 DNA test that concluded a
Jefferson male likely fathered Hemings' youngest son, Eston.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Although paternity cannot be established with absolute certainty, our
evaluation of the best evidence available suggests the strong likelihood that
Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings had a relationship over time that led to the
birth of one, and perhaps all, of the known children of Sally Hemings,'' Daniel
P. Jordan, the foundation's president, said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whether it was love or lust, rape or romance, no one knows and it's
unlikely that anyone will ever know,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jefferson, who was president from 1801 to 1809, was accused publicly in 1802
of fathering several children by Hemings. Scholars have been divided over the
issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's about time that someone is validating what oral history has confirmed
for years,'' Shay Banks-Young, a Hemings descendant who lives in Columbus, Ohio,
said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
	   James Truscott, head of the Monticello Association, a group of descendants
from Jefferson's daughters Martha Jefferson Randolph and Maria Jefferson Eppes,
declined to comment because he had not seen the foundation's report.
</P>
<P>
	   That group is planning to release its own report on Jefferson descendants
later this year, which will also look into the relationship between Jefferson
and Hemings. The Monticello Association generally has not embraced the idea that
Jefferson and Hemings had a sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after the 1998 DNA study was released, Jordan appointed a research
committee at the Jefferson Memorial Foundation to study the relationship.
Committee members reviewed historical and scientific documents and talked with
descendants of Monticello slaves and others with knowledge of the
Jefferson-Hemings connection.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe it represents the most extensive compilation ever of what is
known and not known about this complex and consequential topic,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
	   The report concluded that the results of the DNA test, conducted by retired
pathology professor Eugene Foster of Charlottesville, were valid.
</P>
<P>
	   After the DNA study came out, some had suggested the real father of Eston
Hemings might have been the president's brother Randolph or one of Randolph's
six sons.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee found that it was unlikely that any of those Jefferson males
fathered Hemings' children because there is no evidence the men were at
Monticello when she became pregnant. Lucia Stanton, a senior research historian
at Monticello, said Hemings conceived her children at times when Thomas
Jefferson was at Monticello.
</P>
<P>
	   The research committee's chairwoman, Dianne Swann-Wright, noted that
Jefferson freed all of Hemings' children when they were adults -- a highly
unusual move for that time. According to the committee's report, Jefferson gave
freedom to no other slave family.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that speaks for itself,'' Swann-Wright said.

<HEADLINE> Cohen, Chinese General Hold Session  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen met Wednesday with a
senior Chinese general to discuss improving military relations in the aftermath
of the mistaken U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia last May.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenneth Bacon, a spokesman for Cohen, said the defense secretary hoped to
visit Beijing this year. Cohen had to cancel a planned visit last year after
China cut off military contacts following the embassy bombing.
</P>
<P>
	   People's Liberation Army Lt. Gen. Xiong Guangkai and other Chinese military
officials held a second day of substantive talks with a Defense Department
delegation headed by Walter Slocombe, the undersecretary of defense for policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Bacon told reporters the talks had been ``very constructive,'' though he
offered little detail other than to note that the two delegations lunched on a
Mexican dish of chicken and chocolate.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, the Chinese general met with Cohen in his Pentagon office, Bacon
said.
</P>
<P>
	   A former head of military intelligence, Xiong is deputy chief of the general
staff of the People's Liberation Army. He is one of China's most politically
influential generals and is known for hard-line views on the United States. He
is a member of the ruling Communist Party's committee that sets policy toward
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to a 2000 agenda for military exchanges, the two sides were
expected to discuss the situation in North Korea, U.S. plans for ballistic
missile defenses, expansion of the NATO alliance and Asia-Pacific regional
issues, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon hopes the talks will clarify prospects for expanding high-level
contacts, including a visit to Beijing this year by Adm. Dennis Blair, commander
in chief of the U.S. Pacific Command, and by Cohen.
</P>
<P>
	   China agreed to send Xiong to Washington after the Clinton administration
said in mid-December it would seek $28 million from Congress for the extensive
bomb damage to China's embassy in Belgrade. China agreed to pay $2.87 million
for damage done in reprisal attacks on the U.S. Embassy and consular offices in
China.

<HEADLINE> Chiefs' Thomas May Be Upgraded Soon  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MIAMI (AP) -- Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Derrick Thomas, paralyzed from
the chest down following a car crash, might be moved out of intensive care on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas could be transferred to a rehabilitation facility in about two weeks.
He already has begun working with therapists.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas, 33, remained in serious but stable condition at Jackson Memorial
Hospital following surgery to rebuild part of his spine, hospital spokeswoman
Maria Rosa Gonzalez said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The nine-time Pro Bowl player was thrown from his car Sunday after losing
control on an icy highway near Kansas City, Mo. He broke his spine and neck and
wound up semiconscious with no feeling in his legs.
</P>
<P>
	   His spinal cord was not severed as doctor originally feared. It was badly
bruised, which doctors said gives Thomas a better chance of recovering lost
feeling in his lower body.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chiefs linebacker and two companions were heading to the Kansas City
airport at the time of the accident. They were planning to fly to St. Louis for
the NFC Championship game when their car flipped on an icy road.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas and Mike Tellis, 49, were not wearing seat belts and were thrown from
the car, police said. Tellis was killed instantly. A third man in the car who
was wearing a seat belt was treated and released.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Indians Seek Gov't Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- The leader of the Indian movement whose revolt
precipitated President Jamil Mahuad's overthrow said Wednesday he wants direct
talks with the new government.
</P>
<P>
	   Antonio Vargas said Indian leaders are prepared to discuss privatizing state
companies, repaying Ecuador's $13 billion debt and abandoning the national
currency, the sucre, for the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want direct dialogue about profound changes,'' said Vargas, head of the
Confederation of Indigenous Nations of Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
	   The Indians will suspend their uprising for at least six months but will
rise up again if the new government does not halt endemic corruption and
poverty, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Angry at ousted president Jamil Mahuad's inability to stop Ecuador's
economic slide, Vargas led hundreds of Indian protesters to occupy the empty
Congress building last week with a cadre of young army officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Their proclamation of a ``Parliament of the People'' led by a three-man
governing junta prompted the military high command to force Mahuad from power to
avoid ``a social explosion.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gen. Carlos Mendoza, the country's military chief, took a seat in the junta
with Vargas and a former Supreme Court judge. But he later dissolved it and
resigned as military commander, buckling under pressure from Washington and more
than 20 regional commanders who rejected the overthrow of civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
	   Power was ceded to Vice President Gustavo Noboa, who on Wednesday received
the presidential sash in a ceremony in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Vargas accused the military high command of taking advantage of the Indians
in an attempt to seize power.
</P>
<P>
	   His organization also distributed to newspapers a copy of a document
proclaiming total military rule that the high command allegedly prepared the
night of the coup but never issued.
</P>
<P>
	   The Indian leader said he does not intend to run from an arrest order for
his part in the coup and only asked authorities not to treat him as a common
criminal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am here showing my face,'' said Vargas. ``If for fighting against
corruption, against misery and hunger they take me to prison, I will go.''

give an upbeat assessment of the month-old push to take Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   The approximately 3,000 rebels remaining in Grozny ``have nowhere to go and
their backs are against the wall,'' said Gen. Valery Manilov.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite heavy snow and fog, Russian warplanes bombed the city and Russian
troops pressed their eight-day struggle to penetrate the city center.
</P>
<P>
	   Manilov told a news conference in Moscow that federal aircraft and artillery
were targeting only about 30 percent of the buildings in Grozny -- including
administrative buildings and high-rises -- because civilians were believed to be
taking shelter in the rest.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are trying to minimize the losses among peaceful civilians in the
course of the anti-terrorist operation in Chechnya,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Manilov said civilian deaths in Chechnya were in the hundreds rather than
the thousands as claimed by the Chechens, who say the Russians are bombing and
shelling indiscriminately.
</P>
<P>
	   Fierce fighting engulfed bomb-shattered districts of eastern Grozny, which
the Russians had previously claimed to control. The Russians appeared to have
made no progress toward seizing a key objective, Minutka Square, from the
rebels. The square, near a Russian-held bridge across the Sunzha River that
bisects the city, could give Russian forces substantial leverage for moving into
downtown Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia's ORT television channel reported that snipers were firing heavily
from high-rises along the streets leading to the square.
</P>
<P>
	   In the other major center of rebel resistance, the rugged southern
mountains, Russian forces waged heavy air and artillery strikes Wednesday
against suspected rebel bases in the Argun and Vedeno gorges.
</P>
<P>
	   Manilov claimed that troops had blocked both gorges, the news agency
ITAR-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The gorges are key corridors through the mountains. The Russians believe
that in addition to reinforcements, rebel supplies are coming through the
gorges, some of them from Georgia, the only foreign country that borders
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   The military command said Wednesday that Russian aircraft had flown 150
combat missions over the past 24 hours throughout Chechnya, and that seven
soldiers had been killed. Russian officials said Tuesday that 1,055 troops have
died since the Chechnya ground operation began in September -- more than twice
the total announced just three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Soldiers say even the new numbers are wrong.
</P>
<P>
	   ``On television they say there are no casualties,'' said a conscript who
gave only his first name, Vitaly. ``Well, we go in there ourselves, we see the
helicopters ferrying back dead bodies every day.''
</P>
<P>
	   Officials in the neighboring republic of Ingushetia, where most of the
250,000 refugees who have fled Chechnya took refuge, said that a Russian
airplane had fired several rockets Wednesday at the Ingush village of Datikh,
four miles from the Chechen border. No casualties or damage were reported, but
the Ingush leadership filed a protest with the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's very difficult to say whether or not it was an error,'' said Bagaudin
Aushev, secretary of the Ingush Security Council. ``We can't rule out anything
until an investigation has been completed.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Moscow, presidential aide Sergei Yastrzhembsky warned that international
sanctions against Russia would be ``counterproductive.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the continent's highest
human rights body, was due to vote Thursday on whether to suspend Russia over
its offensive in Chechnya. Such a vote would be seen as a symbolic blow to
Russian aspirations for closer ties with European institutions.
</P>
<P>
	   But on Wednesday, the assembly's Political Affairs Committee submitted a
report that would give Moscow a further three months to show progress toward
ending the Chechen conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian troops entered Chechnya after Chechen-based militants stormed
villages in the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan. The rebels were also
blamed for a series of deadly bombings of apartment houses in Moscow and two
other cities in September.

<HEADLINE> N.J. woman expecting septuplets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEPTUNE, N.J. (AP) - When their daughter died in infancy two years ago,
Ivette Zapata-Smalls and her husband Fred raged against God, demanding to know
why their child had to die when so many evil people seem to flourish.
<P>
	   But now the Lakewood couple see the hand of God in Ivette's latest
pregnancy. If all goes as hoped, by late March she would become one of only a
handful of women in the world to give birth to seven babies at once.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple say their strong Christian faith led them to reject the advice of
doctors who say that aborting as many as four or five of the fetuses now would
improve the chances of the remaining ones. After the death of their 21-month-old
daughter, Anisa, from rheumatoid arthritis in 1998, they said, there could be no
thought of losing another child, no matter how many Ivette was carrying.
</P>
<P>
	   "We fought for her life," Ivette Zapata-Smalls said Wednesday. "We said,
'How can you fight for one life and then kill any life after that?' We're
Christians, my husband is an evangelist, and you have to practice what you
preach. We're both against abortion, and we just couldn't do it."
</P>
<P>
	   The couple had been trying without success to have another child before
Anisa's death. Afterward, Ivette began taking Clomid, a fertility drug that
stimulates the production of eggs in the ovaries, but it still didn't work. Then
a doctor switched her to a stronger drug called Pergonal.
</P>
<P>
	   "I took really well to it," Ivette said in a knowing understatement. "And
they gave me a reduced dose of it. If I'd had a full dose, God knows how many
babies would be in here."
</P>
<P>
	   Ivette, 31, is confined to bed rest at Jersey Shore Medical Center in
Neptune, where she is to remain until late March, when the fetuses will have
reached 28 or 29 weeks. At that point, she is to deliver them by Caesarean
section.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, she and the fetuses are doing well, according to her obstetrician,
Dr. Charles Hux of Brick Township, who specializes in high-risk pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
	   "Things are very good right now, but we've got a long way to go," he said.
"They're still not viable for another four weeks, and that's when the dangerous
part comes in, when she starts to get really big. The human body just can't hold
that many babies for too long."
</P>
<P>
	   The couple is aware of the risks of proceeding with multiple deliveries,
both to them and to Ivette. She's already had a kidney stone and two episodes of
blood clots caused by her oversized uterus pressing on blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was painful and scary, because I'd never had a blood clot before," she
said. "But I said if it's not doing any harm to them, then I can deal with it."
</P>
<P>
	   Hux said he recommended that Ivette consider aborting four or five of the
fetuses - he calls it "a reduction" - but the couple would have none of it. Even
though she'll be at greater risk of high blood pressure, diabetes, premature
labor and rupturing of the amniotic sac surrounding the fetuses, Ivette and her
husband want to keep all seven.
</P>
<P>
	   "We talked about a reduction to twins or triplets, but because of their
religious beliefs, they were against that, so I'm supporting them in whatever
they want to do," Hux said.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, all seven babies are growing normally, and are about 13 ounces
apiece. When delivered, they should weigh between 2 1/2 to 3 pounds each. If the
pregnancy can be extended to 28 or 29 weeks, there is about a 75 percent chance
that all seven babies can survive, although some might be born with medical
complications that can't be foreseen, Hux said. A normal single-fetus pregnancy
lasts about 38 weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, doctors know Ivette is carrying three girls and two boys. The sex of
the other two can't yet be determined. Fred Smalls has picked the names Elijah
and Elishah for the two boys; Ivette still doesn't know what to call the girls.
</P>
<P>
	   Ivette knows she and her husband - a former star football player at West
Virginia who now works as dean of discipline at Titusville Academy, a Mercer
County alternative school - will need lots of help once the babies are born.
They have some relatives willing to pitch in and help, but haven't made detailed
plans just yet for things like feeding and sleeping schedules, and the hundreds
of diapers the newborns will go through each week.
</P>
<P>
	   Their four-bedroom home, which once seemed so spacious, now seems a lot
smaller. A nursery planned for one baby will now have to be greatly expanded.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not unrealistic," she said. "We know we're going to need a lot of
help. We're going to rely on people's hearts."

<HEADLINE> Ben &AMP; Jerry's Net Income Up  </HEADLINE>
    By ROSS SNEYD AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade Inc. said a jump in the
company's fourth-quarter sales boosted profits above Wall Street's prediction.
</P>
<P>
	   But there was no word Wednesday on when or how the company's board of
directors would respond to offers to buy the company.
</P>
<P>
	   Earnings in the October-December period, excluding a restructuring charge
for eliminating the production of novelty products, totaled $1 million, or 14
cents a share, compared with $840,000, or 11 cents a share, a year earlier.
Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected fourth-quarter
earnings of 11 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Including the restructuring charge, the company reported a fourth-quarter
loss of $4.56 million, or 64 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales for the quarter were $51.68 million, up nearly 17 percent from $44.33
million a year earlier. The company credited increased sales in the United
Kingdom and higher sales of pints of ice cream in the United States for the
growth.
</P>
<P>
	   The special charge related to eliminating the production of novelty ice
cream products, such as chocolate-coated bars, at a company-owned plant in
Springfield, Vt. It plans to hire an outside company to produce its novelty
items.
</P>
<P>
	   In early afternoon, shares in Ben &AMP; Jerry's were unchanged at $22.50 on the
Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, net income excluding the special charge was $9 million, or
$1.21 a share, compared with $6.24 million, or 84 cents, in 1998. Including the
charge, earnings were $3.39 million, or 46 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales totaled $237 million, up 13 percent from $209.2 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Ben &AMP; Jerry's repeated its December announcement that it had received
"indications of interest" to acquire the company, but gave no clue how it might
respond.
</P>
<P>
	   "No decision has been made by the board with respect to any of these
indications of interest or as to any sale of the company," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Several coalitions of franchisees and customers have been formed to fight a
takeover.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Co-Chair To Retire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DETROIT (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Robert Eaton, the former
Chrysler chairman and CEO who helped orchestrate the merger with Daimler-Benz
AG, will retire from the company March 31.
</P>
<P>
	   DaimlerChrysler said Eaton, 59, gave the announcement to a meeting of senior
managers Wednesday, saying that "this is the right time for me to go."
</P>
<P>
	   "The merger is complete," Eaton said, according to a company statement. "The
structure and future leadership is in place. The two companies are one, my goal
has been accomplished."
</P>
<P>
	   When Chrysler was acquired by Daimler-Benz AG in 1998, Eaton said he would
share the job of chairman with Daimler-Benz head Juergen Schrempp for no more
than three years, then retire.
</P>
<P>
	   Eaton had said he would retire earlier if the major hurdles of the merger
were completed.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the long-term, there can be only one boss," German magazine Der Spiegel
quoted Eaton as saying in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   As recently as a few weeks ago, Eaton said in an interview there was "no new
news to report" about his status with the company.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of DaimlerChyrsler were trading down 81 1/4 cents to $67.18 3/4 in
later afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Nomination Fights Shift to N.H.  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Struggling to field a sensitive abortion question,
GOP presidential candidate John McCain said today if his 15-year-old daughter
wanted to end an unwanted pregnancy it would be a ``family decision, not her
decision.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's comments, quickly attacked as too weak by Republican rival Alan
Keyes, came as the candidates were preparing for their final debate tonight
before the New Hampshire primary. The field narrowed to five as Utah Sen. Orrin
Hatch dropped out of the race, acknowledging the odds against him were
``extremely long'' from the start.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking in Washington, Hatch endorsed front-runner George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator Hatch took a long look at all of us running and I am most
appreciative,'' Bush said while campaigning in New Hampshire. The Texas governor
focused today on laying out his plan for using the budget surplus to cut taxes,
reduce the national debt and shore up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was clearly irritated as reporters on his campaign bus pressed him on
the hypothetical abortion question: Would he tell his teen-age daughter she
could not get an abortion?
</P>
<P>
	   Initially, he answered ``No, it would be a private decision... . Obviously I
would encourage her to know that the baby would be brought up in a warm and
loving family. The final decision would be made by Meghan with our advice and
counsel.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if that was the same answer an abortion-rights advocate would give,
McCain added, ``I don't think it is the pro-choice position to say that my
daughter and my wife and I will discuss something that is a family matter that
we have to decide.''
</P>
<P>
	   A few minutes later, he called reporters together to clarify his answer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I misspoke. What I believed I was saying and intended to say is that this
is a family decision,'' McCain said, not his daughter's decision alone.
</P>
<P>
	   Later at a stop at the Merrimack Restaurant, pelted by reporters' follow-up
questions, McCain reiterated, ``It's a family decision, not her decision'' and
said that was a ``pro-life'' position. He refused to answer further questions,
turning to greet diners.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has said abortion should be illegal except in cases of rape, incest
or to save the mother's life. He favors parental consent laws for abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   Previously, Bush, who has faced frequent questions about the strength of his
anti-abortion convictions, was asked a slightly different question -- what he
would do if one of his relatives faced such a decision because of rape. ``It
would be up to her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes said neither Bush nor McCain could succeed in the general election as
the party's nominee because they can't articulate an anti-abortion stance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They don't have it in their hearts, they don't have it in their minds.
They haven't thought it through,'' Keyes said in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes gave his answer to the pregnant-daughter question: ``My daughter has
been raised to believe that that's God's decision, and that it's already been
made. And therefore, I have no fear of what she would do.''
</P>
<P>
	   During an earlier debate, conservative activist Gary Bauer said under
circumstances of rape he would pray for his daughter ``and explain to her that
she couldn't make right the terrible thing that had happened to her by taking
the life of her innocent, unborn child.''
</P>
<P>
	   Such questions have a history. In 1992, Vice President Dan Quayle drew the
ire of some abortion opponents when he said on ``Larry King Live'' that, should
his young daughter become pregnant, he would counsel against abortion but
support her in ``whatever decision she made.''
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes, Bauer and Steve Forbes have pushed the abortion issue this year, but
it is expected to be less important in New Hampshire, where many independents
vote in the GOP primary, than it was in the Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer indicated he would press Bush in the debate tonight on abortion, as
well as China policy and other subjects.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is so much work to do with George and so little time to do it,''
Bauer said in Hollis, N.H., today.
</P>
<P>
	   In a WGIR radio in interview in Manchester, Bauer tried to dampen
speculation about his political future after finishing fourth in Iowa, with 9
percent of the vote, behind Bush, Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The reality is that people like you were saying that there was no way that
I could beat people like (Dan) Quayle or (Lamar) Alexander, and those people are
gone now,'' Bauer said, referring to earlier dropouts.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking farther ahead, a new poll today found a tight race between Bush and
McCain in Arizona -- the senator's home state -- although two-thirds of
Republicans surveyed there thought Bush would win the race nationally. McCain
was favored by 37 percent and Bush by 30 percent, with a margin of error of plus
or minus 4.2 percentage points. The other candidates were in single digits. The
poll, by KAET-TV and the Arizona State University journalism school, surveyed
527 likely Republican voters last Thursday through Sunday. The Arizona primary
is Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, McCain told reporters: ``I am fully prepared to be president of
the United States -- more prepared than any other candidate.''
</P>
<P>
	   That dovetailed with a new television ad he began airing a day earlier,
which says he is the ``only candidate who knows the military and understands the
world.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, coming off a win in the Iowa caucuses, said Midwest voters had seen in
him what Texas voters had endorsed through two elections, as well as what a
majority of Republican senators and governors support through their
endorsements.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think if the people of New Hampshire listen to the facts and look at my
record and look at the confirmation from United States senators and governors,
they will know and they will be comforted by the fact that I can lead,'' Bush
said.

<HEADLINE> Titans' Defensive Line Workmanlike  </HEADLINE>
    By EDDIE PELLS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- The first-round draft pick preened behind the podium and
fielded the millionth question about his wingspan, his pass rush and what it's
like to be The Freak.
</P>
<P>
	   Across the room, the second-round draft pick sat alone at an out-of-the-way
table and leafed through the morning's business section.
</P>
<P>
	   Like every Titans defensive lineman not named Jevon Kearse, rookie John
Thornton has had plenty of time to himself -- not only this week, but all season
long.
</P>
<P>
	   With Kearse drawing double teams from opponents and even more attention from
the media, players like Thornton, Jason Fisk, Kenny Holmes, Henry Ford and Josh
Evans have helped transform the line from average to elite in relative
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   They're a big reason the Titans are playing in the Super Bowl on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the perfect situation for me, because there's no pressure," said
Thornton, the second-round pick out of West Virginia. "I came in and did my job.
Sometimes it got noticed, sometimes it didn't. But there was no pressure on me
to have a big year, because I'm playing behind a first-round pick who's having a
great season."
</P>
<P>
	   Kearse earned All-Pro honors, won the Rookie of the Year award and made his
first Pro Bowl based on a dominating season in which he set the NFL rookie
record with 14.5 sacks.
</P>
<P>
	   That's more than the entire line had all last season, and almost half of the
30 sacks the whole team produced.
</P>
<P>
	   While teams were focusing on The Freak, the Freakettes combined for 22.5
sacks to help the Titans finish with a team-record 54.
</P>
<P>
	   "If they want do this and that to Jevon, that's OK," said defensive lineman
Mike Jones. "We figure somebody else will be one-on-one and make the play."
</P>
<P>
	   Kearse's presence was just one factor in the resurgence.
</P>
<P>
	   Another part had to do with simplifying of the scheme under coach Jeff
Fisher's version of the Chicago Bears' old 46 defense. Still another had to do
with hiring veteran defensive line coach Jim Washburn.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I first met with them I knew there was plenty of talent in that room,"
Washburn said. "I think they just didn't believe in themselves. A couple of guys
said, 'We just need someone to believe in us."'
</P>
<P>
	   Washburn did, and the team responded.
</P>
<P>
	   Thornton finished with 4.5 sacks, respectable for a first-year player still
feeling his way around the league. Fisk had four sacks, seven more tackles
behind the line and 12 quarterback pressures.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford, who has shifted from end to tackle, then back to end again during the
past four seasons, had 5.5 sacks and 17 quarterback pressures. Holmes had four
sacks and dropped into coverage for two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
	   "The biggest thing was that they let us just go out and play," Holmes said.
"We don't blitz as much. The team depends on us and has faith in the line to
make big plays. That's been the case all year. They've had confidence that we're
going to get the job done and they don't have to commit another guy to help us."
</P>
<P>
	   Among the supporting cast's most impressive achievements was its success
against AFC Central champion Jacksonville. Kearse struggled in Tennessee's last
two victories over the Jaguars, finishing with just one meaningless sack while
matched up against Pro Bowl tackle Leon Searcy.
</P>
<P>
	   But the other five linemen combined for five sacks and held Fred Taylor to
only one rush of more than 15 yards in 35 total carries, as the Titans dominated
the line of scrimmage in both games.
</P>
<P>
	   Washburn says coaching Kearse and company was simply a matter of helping the
linemen find a comfort zone, then letting them play.
</P>
<P>
	   "There isn't a whole lot of coaching at this level for a position coach,"
Washburn said. "You just try to bring out the best in them. When I got here, I
thought we'd go to the Super Bowl. I said we were going to break the sack
record. I thought it and I meant it. None of this surprises me."

<HEADLINE> Report: Palestinians Offer New Deal  </HEADLINE>
   By RON KAMPEAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM -- A Palestinian proposal for a final peace settlement that
includes concessions on Jewish settlements and Jerusalem was reported Wednesday
in an Israeli newspaper -- but it was immediately repudiated as unfounded by
Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the report in Haaretz, the proposal cedes some West Bank
territory containing large blocks of Jewish settlements to Israeli sovereignty
in exchange for parts of Israel. It also reportedly offers joint administration
of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
	   Another innovation in the proposal -- reported by Haaretz to have been
unveiled by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in a meeting with President Clinton
last week -- is a backdown on refugee policy.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Haaretz, the Palestinian proposal has Israel recognizing the
right of Palestinian refugees whose forebears left Israel during its
independence war to return -- but not actually allowing such a return in
practice.
</P>
<P>
	   Haaretz did not give the source of its report.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian officials said there was no basis to the report, insisting their
bottom line remains the same: a return of all Palestinian-inhabited land
captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War, a capital in east Jerusalem, and the
unequivocal right of Palestinians to return.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not true at all,'' said Yasser Abed Rabbo, one of the two lead
Palestinian negotiators. ``We didn't submit such a plan to the Americans, nor to
others, we didn't even discuss these proposals with the Israelis. This looks
like an Israeli trial balloon.''
</P>
<P>
	   Still, two of the proposals -- land trades that would allow some Jewish
settlements to remain under Israeli sovereignty, and shared administration of
Jerusalem -- date back to informal talks held by Israeli Yossi Beilin and
Palestinian Ahmed Qureia five years ago. Both men are now in influential
positions: Beilin is Justice Minister and Qureia is speaker of the Palestinian
legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal on refugees would difficult for Arafat to sell to his people.
Much of his credibility over the years has been drawn from his stated
determination to defend the interests of refugee communities.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Wednesday that the issue of returning
Palestinian refugees should wait until after final agreements were reached.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Israel is a tiny country ... When the time comes to establish a political
Palestinian entity it will be more natural for the refugees to come back,'' he
said in Stockholm, Sweden, where he is attending a conference on the Holocaust.
``I'm on principle against the coming of a single refugee as part of an
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Jerusalem, Palestinians have demanded sovereignty over the traditionally
Arab eastern part of the city, where they plan to set up a capital; Israel
insists the city will remain united.
</P>
<P>
	   The joint administration of the city outlined in Haaretz would face stiff
Israeli resistance.
</P>
<P>
	   Jerusalem's mayor, Ehud Olmert, told Israel television that such a plan is
``a recipe for eternal friction and debate.''
</P>
<P>
	   The report comes as the two sides both acknowledge the difficulty of meeting
a Feb. 13 deadline for reaching the outline of an agreement on the key issues
dividing them, including borders, Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlers and
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
	   Abed Rabbo said talks aimed at meeting the deadline would begin Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Independents Could Tip N.H. Scales  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   An AP News Analysis
By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
</P>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- New Hampshire Republicans weren't the largest group
of voters watching Wednesday's double-barreled debates. Nor were Democrats.
Independents are the big bloc in this state's politics, and they were getting a
rare chance to size up both presidential fields at once.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's one-stop shopping,'' said Terry Blair, a single mother from
Manchester. One of 274,000 registered independents, Blair was tuning into the
90-minute Republican debate at 7 p.m. and -- ``after a break for bath time'' --
was catching the Democrats at 9.
</P>
<P>
	   New Hampshire independents outnumber the state's 265,000 Republicans and
194,000 Democrats, and they can vote in either primary Tuesday. That's why
voters like Blair are so important to the seven major-party candidates,
particularly Republican John McCain and Democrat Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In a tight race -- and we've got close races on both sides of the fence
this year -- the independents can make all the difference,'' Republican state
chairman Steve Duprey said.
</P>
<P>
	   State analysts say at least one-third of the independents support
Republicans almost every election. They react to the tax-cutting, small
government GOP message but just like the ``independent'' label.
</P>
<P>
	   Another one-third, or slightly less, of self-described independents
generally support Democratic candidates and issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty-five percent or so of the registered independents are ``true
independents'' and swing between parties -- a fraction of New Hampshire's total
voting population, said Robin Marra, director of polling at Franklin Pierce
College in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's the universe that Bradley and McCain are fighting over,'' he said.
``It's small, but potentially significant.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain and his party seem to be winning the battle thus far. The number of
self-described independents who said they would support Republicans climbed from
36 percent to 52 percent in the past month, Marra said.
</P>
<P>
	   The trend benefits McCain, who leads front-runner George W. Bush among
independents by a 2-to-1 margin. The Arizona senator has portrayed himself as a
straight-talking reformer to draw even or ahead of the Texas governor in most
state polls.
</P>
<P>
	   Independents support Bradley over his party's front-runner, Vice President
Al Gore, by about 10 percentage points. Like McCain, Bradley supports campaign
finance reform. His laid-back style and promises to fashion a new kind of
politics are particularly appealing to independents.
</P>
<P>
	   But the former New Jersey senator has lost his lead to Gore in state polls,
and is fresh off a big loss in Iowa's caucuses. If undecided independents begin
to sense Gore pulling away, they may bolt to the better race and back McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If I'm George Bush, I'm watching the Democratic debate and rooting for
Bill Bradley,'' Duprey said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain and Bradley are not the only candidates courting independents.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore criticized Bradley on Wednesday for not supporting the administration's
first welfare overhaul initiative. ``I would call upon him ... to change his
position, get with the program of welfare reform that works,'' said the vice
president, whose aides believe that welfare reform is popular among
independents.
</P>
<P>
	   After staking out staunch conservative ground on abortion in Iowa, Bush
quickly moderated his tone in New Hampshire and portrayed himself as the most
mainstream and electable candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   For Bradley and McCain, this may be the time to focus on party regulars.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At this point, because the number of undecided independents is relatively
small I would tell both (McCain and Bradley) to shore up -- or in Bradley's
case, build up -- their support in the party bases,'' Marra said. ``Independents
got you into the ballgame, but you can't win it without party regulars.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley has the biggest problem there; polls show that Gore does much better
among Democrats than his underdog rival. McCain and Bush have been splitting the
GOP vote evenly, though pollsters surveying the state this week say McCain may
be slipping a bit.
</P>
<P>
	   Blair had stopped outside a video store to talk about the debate. She was
holding a pizza box in one hand and using the other to keep her antsy 5-year-old
daughter, Shannon, from splashing in street slush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know who I'm going to vote for yet. There's a little I like about
all of them. I wish I could take what I like about each and roll it into one
very good candidate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Blair said she likes McCain, Bush and Gore. Bradley seems ``aloof and sort
of'' -- she squinched up her face and made up a word -- ``you know, Glelf!''
</P>
<P>
	   ``But, who knows?'' she said. ``I need to see all of them one more time.''

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Criticized for Jet Use  </HEADLINE>
   By SHANNON McCAFFREY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton's air travel came under fire again
Wednesday from a congressman who said the first lady took a jet he had reserved
for a Latin American fact-finding trip.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Cass Ballenger, R-N.C., said Mrs. Clinton used a 14-seat Air Force
Gulfstream jet to fly last week from Washington to campaign appearances in New
York City and Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
	   Ballenger's bipartisan delegation, which had reserved the jet in December,
was forced to use two smaller Air Force planes to fly to Latin America, costing
taxpayers thousands of dollars in extra costs, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It tees me off that here we were on legitimate United States business
important to the country ... and yet she gets the plane for her own political
purposes,'' Ballenger said. ``It doesn't seem fair to me.''
</P>
<P>
	   Howard Wolfson, spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's New York Senate campaign, said
Ballenger's information was wrong, but he could not elaborate because he is
restricted from discussing issues affecting the first lady's security. On the
advice of the Secret Service, Mrs. Clinton's campaign uses government jets.
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign of Mrs. Clinton's likely Republican rival, New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, wasted no time attacking the travel, calling on Mrs. Clinton
to reimburse taxpayers for the extra costs for the Latin American trip.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The extraordinary and unethical expenditures borne by the taxpayers were
incurred because Mrs. Clinton insists on running for the Senate in a state where
she has never lived, worked or paid taxes,'' Giuliani campaign spokeswoman Kim
Serafin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ballenger's delegation traveled to flood-ravaged Venezuela to discuss
disaster aid, and to Colombia, Mexico and Guatemala to talk about
drug-interdiction efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Ballenger's wife also joined the group on the trip. The congressman said his
wife traveled with them because of her fluency in Spanish and prior volunteer
work in the region.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 3.10; Nasdaq Down 100  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices closed mostly lower today, as cautious
investors, fearing a pending interest rate hike, fled the technology sector
despite strong corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 3.10 at 11,032.99, according to
preliminary calculations.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were lower. The Nasdaq composite index fell
sharply, losing about 100 points.
</P>
<P>
	   "We saw a fairly big decline in the technology sector. It had been showing
signs of cracking, and it really kind of came unglued today," said Ricky
Harrington, a technical analyst with Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Market watchers said congressional testimony today by Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Alan Greenspan gave investors few signals about the direction Fed
policy makers are likely to take when they meet to discuss interest rates next
week.
</P>
<P>
	   "Investors were cautious in anticipation of Greenspan's testimony, which
might have given them an indication of where interest rates are going. But he
didn't say anything investors could latch on to one way or the other," said Paul
McEnroe, a trader at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Corporate earnings have proven strong so far, especially in the financial
services sector. J.P. Morgan was up. And brokerage firms, which benefited from a
booming fourth quarter stock market, were up across the board.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, some well-known technology companies were punished Wednesday
for not living up to investors' extraordinary expectations for the sector.
</P>
<P>
	   A case in point was cellular phone chipmaker Qualcomm. And software maker
and network storage company EMC Corp. also fell.
</P>
<P>
	   McEnroe said it appeared as if some investors were rotating money out of
newer technology stocks into more established companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said President Clinton's State of the Union address, slated for
Thursday, was also making investors cautious.

<HEADLINE> Pastrana Makes Pitch for U.S. Aid  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Colombian President Andres Pastrana told American mayors
on Wednesday that a proposed $1.6 billion package to aid his country's antidrug
efforts would bring ``very real benefits to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
	   The two-year package, unveiled earlier this month, is designed mostly to
combat drug trafficking, but also would bolster Colombia's sagging economy and
address social problems. Colombia is by far the world's largest exporter of
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   Pastrana took his campaign for the package to the U.S. Conference of Mayors
after meeting with Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and two other
Republican senators deeply involved on the antidrug front: Paul Coverdell of
Georgia and Mike DeWine of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   Lott said afterward he is generally supportive of Pastrana's approach but
told the Colombian leader that it was important that he show progress.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think the American people are going to want to just keep pouring
money into that situation if they don't make progress in terms of stopping the
growing of coca and stopping the drug running in the air and on the water,''
Lott said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pastrana, who met with Clinton on Tuesday, said he was optimistic about
prospects for the bill after his consultations on Capitol Hill. He called the
case for helping Colombia in its struggle ``clear and compelling.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be important for Congress to hear from America's mayors in the
days and weeks ahead that this initiative is not just in Colombia's interest but
also America's,'' said Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Your voices will help ensure that this critical initiative is not
sidetracked by other legislative priorities or doomed by partisanship or
politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   The issue of illegal drug trafficking and consumption ``is one that all of
you must address every day,'' Pastrana told the mayors.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, at a breakfast meeting with reporters, Pastrana expressed optimism
about prospects for a settlement in Columbia's long-running war with leftist
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the rebels may be more ready than ever to seek a peace settlement,
citing recent conciliatory statements by their leaders as well as an evident
weariness with decades of armed struggle.
</P>
<P>
	   He noted that the leader of the FARC rebel group, Manuel Marulanda, said
recently for the first time that ``he sees the peace process as something that
could go forward.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pastrana also said that the rebels, far from seeking a Cuba-style revolution
in Colombia, seem willing to accept a mutli-party democratic system.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am very optimistic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Skepticism by many on Capitol Hill about the proposed aid package is based
partly on the human rights record of the Colombian Army and the suspicion of
links between the army and paramilitary units.
</P>
<P>
	   Pastrana said abuses by the military have dropped precipitously since 1994,
when there were allegations of 2,000 such cases. He said there were but 70 last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., has said the Colombian Army must show a greater
willingness to turn over personnel accused of rights violations and a concerted
effort to thwart the paramilitary groups believed to be responsible for
thousands of deaths over the years.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Co-Chair To Retire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DETROIT (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Robert Eaton, the former
Chrysler chairman and CEO who helped orchestrate the merger with Daimler-Benz
AG, will retire from the company March 31.
</P>
<P>
	   DaimlerChrysler said Eaton, 59, gave the announcement to a meeting of senior
managers Wednesday, saying that "this is the right time for me to go."
</P>
<P>
	   "The merger is complete," Eaton said, according to a company statement. "The
structure and future leadership is in place. The two companies are one, my goal
has been accomplished."
</P>
<P>
	   When Chrysler was acquired by Daimler-Benz AG in 1998, Eaton said he would
share the job of chairman with Daimler-Benz head Juergen Schrempp for no more
than three years, then retire.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the long-term, there can be only one boss," German magazine Der Spiegel
quoted Eaton as saying in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Eaton began his career at General Motors Corp. in 1963, starting as an
engineer and working his way up to president of General Motors Europe. In 1992,
he left to join Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
	   Eaton was promoted to chairman and chief executive officer on Jan. 1, 1993,
replacing Lee Iacocca. During his tenure, Chrysler reworked itself from the
weakest of the Big Three automakers into a highly profitable company, which won
acclaim for vehicle styling.
</P>
<P>
	   But Eaton also came to believe that Chrysler could not face the future
alone, that only a handful of automakers could survive and compete globally. He
and Schrempp began talking about a possible merger at the 1998 Detroit auto
show, and announced one of the largest industrial mergers ever five months
later.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are leading a new trend we believe will change the future, the face of
the industry," Eaton said when the deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
	   The two leaders acknowledged the merger won't be easy. Their own study of
transnational mergers suggests that 70 percent failed to achieve the kind of
success that had been anticipated. Concerns were raised that the freewheeling
spirit of Chrysler was a poor fit with the regimental view of Daimler.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the merger, several top Chrysler executives have left, including
President Thomas Stallkamp.
</P>
<P>
	   Eaton worked hard to sell the merger to employees and shareholders, and to
ease concerns about culture clashes.
</P>
<P>
	   "This isn't a German or American thing, this is one company striving to be
the number one automotive transportation company in the world," Eaton said in
September.
</P>
<P>
	   Eaton had said he would retire earlier if the major hurdles of the merger
were completed. As recently as a few weeks ago, however, Eaton said in an
interview there was "no new news to report" about his status with the company.
</P>
<P>
	   In his statement Wednesday, Eaton said he was pleased with the newly
combined company's accomplishments, pointing to a 12 percent increase in revenue
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   "The first full year of DaimlerChrysler has been a great one," Eaton said.
"We sold 3.2 million Chrysler, Dodge, Plymouth and Jeep products -- more than
any other year in history.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Russia Concerned About IMF Payment  </HEADLINE>
    By HARRY DUNPHY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russia does not want political factors such as fighting
in the breakaway province of Chechnya to prevent payment of new money from the
International Monetary Fund, the country's tax minister said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Tax Minister Alexander Pochinok, meeting here with Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers, said that Summers agreed Russia had met the economic
conditions the IMF laid down for the second $460 million installment of a $4.5
billion loan.
</P>
<P>
	   "We came to an agreement that the conditions of the (IMF-backed)
macroeconomic program had been fulfilled," Pochinok said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Chechnya did not come up in his talks with Summers.
</P>
<P>
	   Treasury officials were not immediately available for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have done everything right to meet, even exceed, the IMF conditions,"
Pochinok told reporters. "I would hate to see political factors come into play.
Never have we carried out a program so scrupulously."
</P>
<P>
	   Some European governments and two Republican presidential candidates have
called for further IMF payments to be suspended until Russia halts the fighting
in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   Pochinok said he hoped an IMF team currently in Moscow would report back
favorably on Russia's economic performance so the installment could be paid in
February or March. He will meet with this team in Moscow Friday, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said if Russia doesn't receive new funds from the IMF it "will find a way
to manage without them, but it will be difficult."
</P>
<P>
	   Pochinok said the fighting in Chechnya was a drain on the country's
resources that would cut into spending on economic development in Russia,
including reconstruction in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would like to see this (Chechen) problem solved as soon as possible, but
we cannot stop halfway and must restore order," Pochinok said.
</P>
<P>
	   The second IMF installment was originally due in September, but was delayed
after the IMF imposed new conditions amid international concern about what
happened to previous loans. The conditions included reform of the banking sector
and efforts to improve transparency in the operations of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian government is counting on receiving four IMF installments of
$460 million each in 2000 to help finance its budget. But the funds do not leave
the IMF; they are transferred from one Russian account to another.
</P>
<P>
	   Pochinok said even though IMF installments to Russia were suspended, Moscow
paid back $3 billion to the lending agency in 1999, reducing the amount owed to
$15 billion. Russia is the largest IMF borrower.

<HEADLINE> Philip Morris' Earnings Increase  </HEADLINE>
    By SKIP WOLLENBERG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Philip Morris Cos. Inc.'s profit edged up 2.7 percent in
the fourth quarter as higher prices boosted results from its industry-leading
U.S. tobacco business even though it sold fewer cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
	   The maker of the top-selling Marlboro brand also reported improved
performances from its Kraft food business and its Miller Brewing unit.
</P>
<P>
	   But the results Wednesday were slightly below Wall Street expectations, and
Philip Morris shares skidded almost than 4 percent, or by 81 1/4 cents a share,
to $21.12 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   The drop on Wall Street may reflect investors' lingering concerns about the
industry's exposure to lawsuits by smokers and the federal government, and
wariness about possible new federal initiatives to discourage smoking, said
Martin Feldman, who follows tobacco stocks for Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
	   "This has nothing to with the earnings results whatsoever," Feldman said.
"If anything, the details suggest improving trends in its tobacco and
international operations."
</P>
<P>
	   Before one-time factors, Philip Morris earned $1.81 billion, or 77 cents a
share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, up from $1.77 billion, or 72 cents a
share, a year earlier, when there were unusual charges for settling tobacco
lawsuits with the states.
</P>
<P>
	   Philip Morris said its food and tobacco businesses generated $225 million in
added revenue and $100 million in extra income in the fourth quarter because
people who stocked up in advance of the new year on fears that there may be Y2K
problems. It said there will be a corresponding reduction in the first quarter
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Pretax charges totaling $2.4 billion, mostly for the industry settlement of
suits by the states for the costs of treating sick smokers, had reduced Philip
Morris' net earnings to $274 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue rose 4.4 percent to $19.2 billion from $18.4 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest results were a penny less than the 78 cents a share that analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial expected.
</P>
<P>
	   Chairman Geoffrey C. Bible said "our business fundamentals finished the year
in good shape and we enter 2000 with strong momentum across all of our operating
companies."
</P>
<P>
	   Earnings from the domestic tobacco business was up 1.1 percent to $1.4
billion in the quarter even though Philip Morris sold 4.1 percent fewer
cigarettes. Earnings rose because of record price hikes totaling 63 cents a pack
imposed since November 1998 largely to help defray the costs of the legal
settlement with the states.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite selling fewer cigarettes, Philip Morris finished the year with a
bigger share of the U.S. tobacco market.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said its shipments dropped 8.5 percent for the year but that
industry shipments were off 9 percent. Philip Morris cited independent estimates
that its brands accounted for a record 49.9 percent of U.S. cigarette sales in
1999, up 0.5 percentage point from a year earlier. Marlboro alone accounted for
36 percent of U.S. sales, up 1.6 points, the estimates said.
</P>
<P>
	   International tobacco earnings were up 0.2 percent for the quarter despite
shipping 3.1 percent fewer cigarettes. Higher prices helped.
</P>
<P>
	   Profits from the Kraft Foods business rose 6 percent in North America and
1.8 percent elsewhere for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Miller Brewing's profits rose 83 percent in the quarter because of higher
prices, the company's increased work under contract with other brewers and
recently acquired brands from Stroh and Pabst.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, Philip Morris earned $7.7 billion, or $3.19 a share, up from
$5.37 billion, or $2.20 a share, in 1998. Revenue rose 5.7 percent to $78.6
billion from $74.4 billion.

<HEADLINE> Shells Land Near Lebanon Schools  </HEADLINE>
   By EDMOND SHEDID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) -- Mortar shells exploded near two schools in south
Lebanon on Wednesday, sending panicked students running for cover, Lebanese
security officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The schools were not hit, but about 10 students were hospitalized and
treated for shock, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   In fighting elsewhere in the region, a 22-year-old Hezbollah guerrilla was
killed during a clash with Israeli troops, a Hezbollah statement said. It said
the clash started after guerrillas attacked four Israeli and pro-Israeli militia
positions.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hezbollah guerrillas have been fighting for years to oust 1,500 Israeli
soldiers and 2,500 pro-Israeli militiamen from the occupied zone in south
Lebanon, near Israel's border. Israel set up the zone in 1985 as a buffer
against cross-border guerrilla attacks on its northern towns.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday's clashes came a day after a guerrilla rocket killed an Israeli
soldier and a retaliatory Israeli missile attack wounded two civilian women.
</P>
<P>
	   Mortar shells narrowly missed a girls' secondary school and a nearby
intermediate school for boys and girls in the village of Kfar Roumman on the
edge of an Israeli-occupied border zone, according to Lebanese security
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The officials said the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army militia fired the
shells after guerrillas attacked its position.
</P>
<P>
	   Students rushed out of their classrooms to seek shelter in lower floors. A
12-year-old boy who was walking past the schools broke his arm as he scrambled
to take cover, the security officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The SLA had no immediate reaction to the reports. Militiamen have hit
civilians in front-line villages in the past while retaliating for guerrilla
attacks. Six weeks ago, 20 schoolchildren were injured when mortar shells hit an
elementary school in Arab Salim, a village near Nabatiyeh. Israel expressed
regret, saying the attack was an accident.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Orchestra Says Goodbye  </HEADLINE>
   By DANIEL J. WAKIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- South Africa's leading orchestra played a
tragic melody Wednesday -- goodbye.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Symphony Orchestra played the first of two free concerts --
with no conducter, no payment, and almost no future. The 76-year-old orchestra
has run out of money.
</P>
<P>
	   The regular musicians who showed up said they accepted the orchestra's
demise, but believe in their hearts that the music will live on. The packed hall
of about 700 people showered applause on the players, and expressed
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm absolutely devastated and terribly, terribly sad,'' said Sippi
Obramawitz. ``It's a very special orchestra and it's the heart of Africa as
well.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tough economic times dried up donations and the government won't come to the
rescue. In the week since the closing was announced, the board said Wednesday it
has received pledges of only $585,000 toward the necessary $1.7 million for
another season.
</P>
<P>
	   The final concerts Wednesday and Thursday are a chance to say farewell. The
publicity doesn't hurt either, said bassoonist Paul Rogers, the players'
informal leader.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are a way of putting pressure on government, the business community
and, let's be honest, on the public,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   During a final rehearsal earlier Wednesday, downcast players ran through the
sweetly tragic melodies of the intermezzo from Mascagni's opera ``Cavalleria
Rusticana.'' Violin cases rested open on the auditorium seats, children's
photographs stuck on the velvet lining.
</P>
<P>
	   With the smell of collapse long in the air, many of the 53 musicians already
shifted gears -- studying computers, selling Amway products, buying a video
store, running a concert agency. Trumpeter Donny Bouwel took a private school
teaching job. American concertmaster Caius Oprea flew back to the United States
for auditions.
</P>
<P>
	   Others are facing life after professional music in a country with few such
positions. It is an excruciating prospect for people who have spent most of
their years practicing on brass and wood and gut.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a passion. It's not just a job,'' said violinist Elsabe Laubscher.
</P>
<P>
	   While accepting that funds have run out, some members believe the board of
directors wants to resurrect the orchestra with longer hours, more pops concerts
and fewer sick days. Board Chairman Don MacRobert denies the suggestion, but
declares, ``We must be more commercial.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some in the African National Congress government, though sorry to see the
orchestra go, accept its departure. It was under apartheid that Western art
forms received lavish funding to the exclusion of African culture. It was partly
thanks to apartheid that the black majority is so desperately in need of money
for basic needs like clean water, clinics, schools -- and maybe not orchestras.
</P>
<P>
	   But despite its mainly white audiences and membership, the NSO accompanies
black choirs and is deeply involved in bringing music to poor children in black
townships through workshops, coaching sessions and other means. It says it has
played for more than 13,000 mostly poor kids since 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Bass trombonist Alex Hitzeroth is one of two nonwhites in the ranks. He
joined the orchestra full-time last Thursday, and hours later was told it was
folding. A tender 18, Hitzeroth plans to continue as a musician.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have to,'' he said. ``It's my life. It's all I wanted to become.''

<HEADLINE> Federal judge orders new guidelines for Megan's Law, threatens  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A federal judge has ordered Attorney General John
Farmer to revamp New Jersey's Megan's Law because sex offender notifications are
getting into the hands of people who have no business seeing them.
<P>
	   The next step could be a court-ordered halt to notifications, shutting down
Megan's Law for the first time in two years.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Joseph Irenas issued his order late Monday in Camden
based on a class-action lawsuit filed by the state Public Defender's Office on
behalf of all sex offenders they represent.
</P>
<P>
	   Megan's Law provides for public notification when sex offenders classified
as posing a moderate or high risk to the community move into a town or are
released from prison.
</P>
<P>
	   In his ruling, Irenas said New Jersey has failed to implement consistent
standards of how notifications are conducted in the 21 counties.
</P>
<P>
	   Irenas issued an order to halt all sex offender notifications, but he
simultaneously agreed to delay its implementation to give Farmer a chance to
appeal to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
	   It will then be up to a three-judge panel there to decide whether Irenas'
order should be enforced.
</P>
<P>
	   After Megan's Law took effect in 1995, sex offender notifications were
stopped under court order for most of the next three years. A final court order
to freeze notifications vanished in January 1998 after the U.S. Supreme Court
refused to accept the most recent appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   Irenas' ruling came in the case of a sex offender identified only as "Paul
P.," which has been expanded into a class action because it represents the same
privacy questions all sex offenders can pose.
</P>
<P>
	   Newspapers were notified about the ruling Wednesday by the Public Defender's
Office because it was handed down after hours Monday and state offices were
closed Tuesday by a snowstorm.

<HEADLINE> Elliott, Spurs Discuss Comeback  </HEADLINE>
    By KELLEY SHANNON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Sean Elliott moved closer to returning to the NBA on
Wednesday when his doctors met with Spurs coach Gregg Popovich about the
forward's recovery from a kidney transplant.
</P>
<P>
	   "We expressed everything we were concerned about as far as what this really
means to compete at this level," Popovich said. "The doctors are very aware of
our concerns."
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott's kidney specialists will keep meeting with Spurs doctors and
coaches to work toward Elliott's medical clearance for contact practices,
possibly by Tuesday or the following day.
</P>
<P>
	   "Then it becomes a basketball decision over the next weeks or months,
whether he gets into games or not," Popovich said. "Once he gets back on the
court, it's not going to be three practices and play."
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott, 31, has been doing light workouts and conditioning training for
weeks but has not taken part in a full practice. While sidelined, he has been a
commentator for Spurs television broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
	   Elliott, who played a key role in San Antonio's championship last year,
received a kidney from his older brother Noel on Aug. 16. Elliott had m focal
segmental glomerular sclerosis, a condition that prevents the kidneys from
properly filtering waste from the blood. Before the transplant, he was within
weeks of having dialysis.
</P>
<P>
	   A return to the NBA by Elliott would be unprecedented, as no professional
athlete has come back to compete after a kidney transplant. Elliott declined to
speak with reporters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, transplant surgeon Dr. Francis Wright and kidney specialist Dr.
John Reineck said Elliott could play and said the possibility of an injury to
his new kidney was remote.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Popovich said a player doesn't have medical clearance until team
doctors give the OK.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors are still researching the physical risks of Elliott playing and
possible side effects from his post-transplant medication.
</P>
<P>
	   Paperwork, including some dealing with liability matters, must be completed.
</P>
<P>
	   "He would probably be on the court by the end of next week if the medical
staff feels comfortable with what they find in their research," Popovich said.
"We need to just look under every rock to make sure we have all the information
we can possibly have."
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, Popovich said he considered it unrealistic to expect
Elliott back this season. On Wednesday, he didn't seem as pessimistic but
cautioned Elliott may not play in a game anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
	   Popovich wouldn't say whether he's glad about the possibility of Elliott's
return, although he said he's happy he has his health again.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm amazed by his perseverance and what he's gone through over the past few
years," the coach said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 3.10; Nasdaq Down 97.47  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices closed mostly lower today, as cautious
investors, fearing a pending interest rate hike, fled the technology sector
despite strong corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 3.10 at 11,032.99.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were lower. The Nasdaq composite index fell
sharply, losing 97.47 points to 4,069.94.
</P>
<P>
	   the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 3.08 to 1,406.95.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,705 down, 1,344 up and 461 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 1.12 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.06 billion in
the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.73 to 520.86.
</P>
<P>
	   "We saw a fairly big decline in the technology sector. It had been showing
signs of cracking, and it really kind of came unglued today," said Ricky
Harrington, a technical analyst with Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Market watchers said congressional testimony today by Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Alan Greenspan gave investors few signals about the direction Fed
policy makers are likely to take when they meet to discuss interest rates next
week.
</P>
<P>
	   "Investors were cautious in anticipation of Greenspan's testimony, which
might have given them an indication of where interest rates are going. But he
didn't say anything investors could latch on to one way or the other," said Paul
McEnroe, a trader at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Corporate earnings have proven strong so far, especially in the financial
services sector. J.P. Morgan was up. And brokerage firms, which benefited from a
booming fourth quarter stock market, were up across the board.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, some well-known technology companies were punished Wednesday
for not living up to investors' extraordinary expectations for the sector.
</P>
<P>
	   A case in point was cellular phone chipmaker Qualcomm. And software maker
and network storage company EMC Corp. also fell.
</P>
<P>
	   McEnroe said it appeared as if some investors were rotating money out of
newer technology stocks into more established companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said President Clinton's State of the Union address, slated for
Thursday, was also making investors cautious.

<HEADLINE> ABC Unfazed by Matchup of Unknowns  </HEADLINE>
    By JOSH DUBOW AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   The St. Louis Rams and Tennessee Titans just started creating excitement in
their own cities this season. They sure haven't built a national following yet.
</P>
<P>
	   That's the challenge facing ABC this week, getting the entire country
interested about two teams most people haven't seen play until the last couple
of weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   "This game is perfect for the fans tired of seeing the Packers, 49ers and
Broncos every year," ABC announcer Al Michaels said, trying to put a positive
spin on this matchup. "This is probably the most improbable Super Bowl matchup
of all time. Looking at it in the preseason, this would have been an almost
inconceivable pairing."
</P>
<P>
	   While the networks were pumping up Miami, Green Bay, Denver and Dallas
throughout the season, St. Louis and Tennessee played in the relative obscurity
of regional TV coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams didn't make a single prime-time appearance on either ABC and ESPN,
and their 14 games on Fox were shown, on average, to about 20 percent of the
country. The Cowboys got more than 2 1/2 times that exposure.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans, who played twice on ESPN, were beamed, on average, to about 12
percent of the nation on CBS -- less than one-quarter of the coverage area of
the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
	   There hasn't been a Super Bowl between two outsiders like this since
Cincinnati played San Francisco in 1982 -- the only other matchup of teams that
didn't have winning records the previous year.
</P>
<P>
	   The silver lining for ABC is that the Bengals-49ers Super Bowl was the
highest-rated ever, having been watched in 49.1 percent of American households.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a very challenging matchup for us," ABC director Craig Janoff said.
"These are two teams we haven't seen on Monday nights. I don't think anyone
would have predicted this."
</P>
<P>
	   Certainly the NFL schedule makers didn't think that Tennessee and St. Louis
would go from a combined 12-20 last season to the Super Bowl this season. Or
that Atlanta and Denver would go from the Super Bowl to a combined 11-21.
</P>
<P>
	   If they did, the Rams or Titans would have made an appearance on "Monday
Night Football" down the stretch, instead of San Francisco, Atlanta, Denver and
the Jets.
</P>
<P>
	   That's why the NFL is considering a proposal for next year to hold off
deciding which late-season games will be shown on Monday nights and nationally
on Sunday afternoons until a few weeks before, instead of a few months.
</P>
<P>
	   "Clearly as our schedule evolved this year, it didn't turn out great," ABC
producer Ken Wolfe said. "San Francisco, the Jets and Denver falling apart makes
for a difficult time for all of us. I don't think the league was entirely happy.
If this comes to pass, it would be a great thing for the us and the fans."
</P>
<P>
	   That won't help ABC this week.
</P>
<P>
	   So instead, the four-hour pregame show will mix in an emotional feature on
Walter Payton with a national introduction to the two teams playing this week.
</P>
<P>
	   "We can't take for granted that everyone watching is totally familiar with
these two teams," said John Filippelli, the vice president of production for ABC
Sports. "It's incumbent on us to find the right balance between letting people
know the players and doing what's emotional."
</P>
<P>
	   ABC also isn't helped by the fact that St. Louis and Nashville are the 21st-
and 30th-largest markets, respectively. That means there aren't enough fans in
those cities to offset any lack of interest in the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
	   "Because there aren't big markets involved, there's bound to be some fall
off. How much is anyone's guess," said Ron Frederick, an advertising executive
at J. Walter Thompson.
</P>
<P>
	   The small-market effect wasn't that dramatic in the league championship
games. Fox's coverage of St. Louis-Tampa Bay was 2 percent higher than last
year's late game between Denver and the Jets, while CBS' telecast of
Tennessee-Jacksonville was 6 percent lower than the Atlanta-Minnesota game a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Frederick predicts that the small markets, the lack of exposure, and even
the elimination of the bye week all could contribute to ABC falling short of its
goal of a 42 rating.
</P>
<P>
	   However, even if that happens, enough people will still gather around their
TV sets Sunday night to make the Super Bowl the highest-rated show of the year.
Since 1972, the game has been watched in at least 40 percent of households every
year but one -- in 1990, when San Francisco beat Denver 55-10.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Super Bowl is always a matter of degree in ratings," Filippelli said.
"At the high end, it will be a 45 to 46, at the low end 39 to 40. Of all sports,
the NFL is less a prisoner of teams involved and the markets than other sports.
It does have some effect, but I think the effect is negligible."

<HEADLINE> New York digs out from nor'easter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   COHOES, N.Y. (AP) - From foreign exchange students who needed to take a
critical test, to volunteer firefighters who slogged away from home to protect
others, to kids who enjoyed the timeless thrill of a snow day, New Yorkers dug
out of a two-day nor'easter on Wednesday.
<P>
	   The storm that began with flurries Tuesday morning and snowballed into
headlines like "Snow beast rushes in" dumped more than 2 feet of snow in some
areas of the state and is blamed on two highway deaths. Yet some of the state's
traditional snowiest spots - parts of central New York and the Adirondacks -
recorded just 2 to 4 inches Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   It was enough, however, to shut down school districts throughout the state
and throw an ice pick into the works of the state Education Department. Some of
the schools that closed around the state still offered the 8:30 a.m. Regents
even though bus transportation was canceled and some roads were treacherous.
</P>
<P>
	   This year's seniors are the first who must pass the state's English Regents
exam to graduate as part of the program to raise standards. Seniors who who
failed or didn't take the test in 11th grade and who missed the test Wednesday
will have just one more shot - in June - if they are to graduate with their
class, according to Bill Hirschen of the state Education Department.
</P>
<P>
	   But a survey by the state Education Department of the state's biggest urban
and high-needs districts indicates very few students were effected, Hirschen
said. No specific figures were available. Of 45 districts surveyed covering
about half of the state's students surveyed, five districts didn't give the
test, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm that closed the schools wasn't over until well into Wednesday,
three rush hours after it began. Dozens of accidents were reported, although few
involved injuries. One woman, 61-year-old Catherine Simmons of Kingston, died
Tuesday afternoon when her car collided with the rear of a snow plow on the
Thruway in Saugerties.
</P>
<P>
	   Maryann Merritt, 35, of Troy, and five other relatives, ages 5, 8, 9, 12 and
16, were being treated Wednesday at hospitals from Albany to Kingston. The plow
driver wasn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Rochester suburb of Chili, a couple's car skidded on ice and slammed
into an oncoming pickup truck Tuesday, killing passenger Marianne Scarpino, 60,
and seriously injuring her husband, Ronald, 62. The impact sent the car sliding
sideways into a tree. The pickup driver suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   The heaviest snowfall in some areas in three or four years was a surprise to
many, and just bad timing for some.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of miles from home, exchange students Stephanie Abel, 17, of
Germany and Kateirna Zafirovska, 17, of Macedonia plowed a new, borrowed car
through a foot of snow that closed Cohoes High School in order to take the
Regents English test. Five months in the United States, the seniors had found
out days before that they needed to pass the test to graduate.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was bad and it was slippery," said Zafirovska of the ride to the school.
"Many didn't make it to the test."
</P>
<P>
	   Getting to school was the last thing on the mind of some.
</P>
<P>
	   In Rochester, a group of high school friends whizzed 300 to 400 feet down
Cobbs Hill on sleds atop eight to 12 inches of fresh, fluffy snow.
</P>
<P>
	   "My head's ready to explode, I was going so fast," offered Mark Barry, 17,
looking for a spell of relaxation during mid-term exam week.
</P>
<P>
	   In Albany, fifth grader Rayanna Wilson and her cousin, third grader Kyrie
Whineglass, were all business on their "snow day."
</P>
<P>
	   Ignoring the cold and the gusts that strafed their faces with bits of icy
snow, they meticulously carved igloos with a broken shovel out of the snow banks
along the street. Rayanna's itinerary: igloos, sledding in the back yard,
shopping at Kmart.
</P>
<P>
	   With the mercury drooping into the teens, winds up to 20 mph made it feel as
cold as 10 below zero near Rochester, while temperatures hovered under 20
degrees in most other parts of the state. Up to 15 inches of snow generated by
Lake Ontario fell in the suburbs east of Rochester. By contrast, Buffalo escaped
with an inch or less. The Hudson Valley reported more than 14 inches of snow in
some areas, with much of eastern New York getting about 10 inches.
</P>
<P>
	   Lake-effect snow was expected to add several inches to central New York and
the Finger Lakes region by Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the snow forecast for eastern New York ended Wednesday, but not soon
enough for a quiet night at home for members of the S.W. Pitts volunteer fire
company in Latham, N.Y. As in many volunteer fire departments, more than a dozen
firefighters stayed overnight at S.W. Pitts on spartan beds and in the
stationhouse on alert during the storm.
</P>
<P>
	   "Anytime we have a big storm - a snow storm or heavy rain when there can be
flooding - we go on standby," said fire company President John D'Allaird, a
volunteer for 39 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Just before 1:30 a.m. Wednesday, the storm was subsiding enough to send the
standby crew home. At 1:38 a.m. the alarm sounded for a house fire. More than a
dozen firefighters returned and got to the scene where the small fire was
quickly contained, said Capt. Warren Carr Jr., who got the call 12 minutes after
he arrived home after more than seven hours at the fire house.
</P>
<P>
	   Four hours later and 20 miles south in downtown Albany, Jay and Cliff Brown
were opening the Miss Albany Diner, a landmark in Naugahyde and linoleum for a
clientele ranging from factory workers to top state officials. It has opened
rain or shine or snow every working morning since 1941.
</P>
<P>
	   To make sure it opened, the Browns stayed in Albany overnight Tuesday rather
than snake their way home to rural Eagle Bridge across the Hudson River during
the early stages of the storm.
</P>
<P>
	   "The only thing you can predict is business during snow storms," laughed
Cliff Brown in the vintage diner developers today spend millions trying to
re-create. "A rotten, cold miserable day is good business. Just a miserable day
is great business."

<HEADLINE> Move toward returning cameras in courtrooms get boost  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - One day after a judge ruled that a law banning
cameras in New York courtrooms is unconstitutional, another judge Wednesday let
cameras into the trial of a woman accused of killing her newborn.
<P>
	   Also Wednesday, Gov. George Pataki and the state's top legislators agreed
that they favor trying to institute a new statewide law on audiovisual coverage
of trials.
</P>
<P>
	   Acting Supreme Court Justice Dan Lamont Wednesday in Albany allowed a pool
camera into the trial of Melissa Strawbridge. Strawbridge, now 24, is accused of
suffocating her baby in a toilet bowl before discarding the remains in a
dumpster.
</P>
<P>
	   Lamont's decision followed Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi's ruling
Tuesday to allow a camera into the Albany courtroom during the trial of four New
York City police officers accused of killing African immigrant Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
	   Teresi's ruling also resurrected the possibility of the state Legislature
and governor revisiting the courtroom cameras issue.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have supported cameras in the courtroom for a long time," Pataki said. "I
think that the way that should be achieved is through the Legislature."
</P>
<P>
	   State Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno said he's concerned about the
implication of Teresi's ruling on other courts. Teresi had said his ruling would
apply to cases other than the Diallo murder trial, but legal experts said they
doubted it would be binding on other judges around the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno said it is an issue "best resolved through the careful deliberation of
the Legislature - not by court edict."
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver - the biggest impediment to
getting a courtroom cameras law back into force - is also ready to take another
look at the issue, spokeswoman Patricia Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This house has always been supportive of legislation for allowing cameras
in the courtroom, as long as it takes into account the need to protect jurors
and potential witnesses," Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
	   It has been almost three years since trials and criminal court hearings were
televised in New York. Audio and video recording was first allowed into New
York's trial courts in 1987, but state lawmakers opted to extend the law
temporarily a few years at a time instead of making the statute permanent.
</P>
<P>
	   The last extender expired in June 1997 and state lawmakers have not renewed
it since.
</P>
<P>
	   State Senator James Lack, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said
the reluctance to extend the law stemmed in a large part from the media circus
surrounding the O.J. Simpson trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Following Teresi's ruling, Lack said the committee will now look into a
Senate bill that seeks to reinstate the law.
</P>
<P>
	   "The coverage of courts by cameras should be as routine as court reports,"
the Suffolk County Republican said.
</P>
<P>
	   Teresi said Tuesday that one of Court TV's cameras can record the
proceedings of the Diallo trial and that the cable network must share the feed
with other television outlets.
</P>
<P>
	   Both the defense lawyers and prosecutors in the Diallo case have said they
don't plan to appeal Teresi's decision. State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer
also said he will not appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said he felt having a televised
coverage of the trial would was a good idea.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think a camera in the court so that the public can follow a trial is a
good thing and I think this case is one people have a great deal of interest
in," he told Albany's WROW-AM radio.
</P>
<P>
	   State Assemblyman Keith Wright, chairman of the state Black, Puerto Rican
and Hispanic Legislative Caucus, also applauded the ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   "Allowing camera access to courtroom proceedings may alleviate some of the
logistical problems surrounding the Bronx community's ability to observe trial
developments," said the Manhattan Democrat.
</P>
<P>
	   A state appeals court ordered the Diallo trial moved to Albany after defense
lawyers argued that a fair and impartial jury could not be assembled in the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   The four officers - Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard
Murphy - were charged with second-degree murder. They are accused of shooting
Diallo, an unarmed street vendor, to death while searching a Bronx neighborhood
for a rape suspect on Feb. 4, 1999. The immigrant was hit by 19 of 41 bullets.
</P>
<P>
	   Jury selection begins Monday.

<P>
    GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Green Bay Packers head coach Mike Sherman hired Ed
Donatell as defensive coordinator on Wednesday and Tom Rossley as offensive
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
	   Rossley, 53, is former quarterbacks coach for the Kansas City Chiefs.
Donatell, 42, spent the past five years as defensive backs coach of the Denver
Broncos.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm excited to join an organization with such a rich history and a
commitment to winning," Donatell said. "I'm also looking forward to broadening
my responsibilities as a defensive coordinator."
</P>
<P>
	   Sherman and Rossley coached together at Holy Cross in 1986 and 1987. Before
joining the Broncos, Donatell was a defensive assistant with the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ed's done a great job with the Broncos, coaching the secondary, and he
deserves the chance to be a defensive coordinator in the National Football
League," Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said.
</P>
<P>

coordinator Emmitt Thomas were hired earlier this week by Minnesota Vikings.

<HEADLINE> Germany Forecasts Good Economy  </HEADLINE>
    By HANS GREIMEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The German economy will continue to expand at a
faster rate this year and the expected 2.5 percent growth will help reduce
unemployment, Finance Minister Hans Eichel said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Delivering his annual forecast for Europe's largest economy from Berlin,
Eichel said the number of jobless should drop by 300,000 by the end of 2000,
putting the average number of unemployed below 4 million for the first time
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   "The atmosphere for German business is good," Eichel said. "The order books
are filled. The outlook is overall optimistic."
</P>
<P>
	   Eichel said the German government's push for tax reform over the coming year
would spur investment and help buoy economic growth at 2.5 percent. That in turn
would help create nearly 120,000 new jobs over the course of the year, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Germany's gross domestic product rose 1.4 percent in 1999, in line with
economist expectations but slower than the 1998 growth rate of 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   German unemployment rose to 10.3 percent in December from 10 percent a month
earlier. For all of 1999, an average of nearly 4.1 million Germans were out of
work, roughly 180,000 fewer than in 1998. That put last year's average
unemployment rate at 10.5 percent, compared with 11.1 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Dixon, an economist with Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said Eichel's
growth forecast might have been a bit too cautious.
</P>
<P>
	   "If anything, growth could pick up a little more," he said. "There is still
a lot of momentum in the German economy that we haven't seen come through in the
numbers yet."
</P>
<P>
	   Eichel also sought to ease fears that the European Central Bank, or ECB,
would raise interest rates in the 11 countries using Europe's common currency,
the euro. He said the inflation rate in Germany would hover between 1 percent
and 1.5 percent over the year, and level out after an early spike attributed to
increased oil prices.
</P>
<P>
	   The ECB has a policy of keeping inflation below 2 percent and has said it
might raise interest rates to keep rising prices in check. But Eichel said
interest rates would remain stable and that the bank would follow a status quo
policy.
</P>
<P>
	   While Dixon agreed that 1.5 percent would be as high as inflation would
climb in Germany, he said the ECB would still be watching other economies in the
euro-using countries. In particular, he said the French economy is growing at
much faster rate.

<HEADLINE> Tommy Harper Rejoins Red Sox  </HEADLINE>
    By JIMMY GOLEN AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- Tommy Harper, the former Boston player and coach who
complained about a racial incident during the team's 1985 spring training and
was fired after the season, was hired Wednesday for a second stint on the Red
Sox coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
	   Harper, 59, will join the major league staff, working primarily on the
outfielders and baserunning. General manager Dan Duquette said Harper's role
will be determined by manager Jimy Williams.
</P>
<P>
	   "Tommy Harper has been one of the most effective coaches in the major
leagues," Duquette said, noting that during Harper's tenure with Montreal the
Expos set franchise records in several offensive categories and produced budding
stars Vladimir Guerrero, Rondell White, and Larry Walker.
</P>
<P>
	   Harper played for the Red Sox from 1972-74 and was the team's MVP in 1973
after leading the AL with a club-record 54 stolen bases and scoring 92 runs with
17 homers. After his playing career ended in 1977, he had several coaching jobs,
working for the Red Sox from 1980-85 as an instructor, first base coach and
special assistant to the general manager.
</P>
<P>
	   But during spring training in 1985, Harper, who is black, complained about a
whites-only outing sponsored by the Winter Haven Elks Club. He was fired at the
end of the season, and he filed a wrongful termination lawsuit that was settled
out of court.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the split was bitter, both sides seemed to put it behind them when
Harper appeared in an old-timer's game at Fenway Park in 1989.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's always nice to come home," he said on a conference call Wednesday.
"And that's the way I've always felt about Boston and the Boston Red Sox.
Because I've never ceased to care about the Boston Red Sox and their fans."
</P>
<P>
	   Harper had a .237 average with 146 homers, 567 RBIs and 408 stolen bases in
15 major league seasons. In 1970, with Milwaukee, Harper became the first
infielder and fifth player overall to hit at least 30 homers and steal at least
30 bases in the same season.
</P>
<P>
	   Harper's is the second public fence-mending for the Red Sox this month. On
Jan. 14 they announced that they will retire Hall of Fame catcher Carlton Fisk's
number even though they had to bend their rules to do it.
</P>
<P>
	   Fisk, whose foul-pole homer in Game 6 of the 1975 World Series is one of
baseball's greatest moments, became a free agent after a contract squabble with
the team in 1980. He played the last 13 years of his career with the Chicago
White Sox but joined the Red Sox as a special assistant to the general manger
last spring.
</P>
<P>
	   Harper said that the hard feelings are behind him and noted that the current
Red Sox management was not with the team in 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have always felt welcome around the Red Sox," he said. "This job today is
a beautiful opportunity for me. But this reconciliation with the Red Sox did not
start today. It started many years ago. It is not an issue today."

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that are moving substantially or trading heavily
today on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   Corning shares rose as the company raised an estimated $1.91 billion through
the sale of 13 million new common shares. The company said it would use the
money for acquisitions, to repay debt and for other corporate purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   EMC shares fell despite reporting fourth quarter earnings of 34 cents a
share, excluding a one-time charge related to an acquisition. The figure beat
Wall Street analysts' estimates of 31 cents a share. Still, the company reported
lower-than-expected revenues for an important segment of its business and
investors fled.
</P>
<P>
	   Merrill Lynch on Tuesday reported fourth quarter earnings more than double
those of a year ago and well above analysts' expectations. The company reported
profits of $764 million, or $1.80 a share, well above the $1.39 a share analysts
had predicted. A year ago, Merrill Lynch reported profits of $359 million, or 86
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Coca-Cola announced it plans to eliminate 20 percent of its work force, or
6,000 jobs, in an effort to cut costs and shift responsibility to local markets.
The job cuts will result in pretax charges of $800 million this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Qualcomm, which makes cellular phone technology, beat analysts' earnings
estimates by a penny, reporting earnings of 25 cents a share. But the company
warned that sales of cellular chips may be off this quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   EBay reported fourth-quarter earnings of 4 cents a share, excluding one-time
charges, beating the 2-cents a share estimate expected by Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
	   Covad, a provider of high-speed Internet access over ordinary copper
telephone lines, reported a fourth-quarter loss of 80 cents a share, beating the
94-cent average loss predicted by analysts.
</P>
<P>
	   CheckFree, an electronic commerce company, reported a loss of 8 cents a
share for its fiscal second quarter, compared with earnings of 22 cents a year
ago. Excluding one-time charges, the company broke even during the second

<HEADLINE> 11 Charged in Macedonia Shootout  </HEADLINE>
   By KONSTANTIN TESTORIDES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- Macedonian police filed charges on Wednesday
against eleven ethnic Albanians in connection with a shootout in which three
policemen were killed earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
	   Four of the eleven, all citizens of this small Balkan country, were charged
with triple homicide, while the remaining seven were charged with complicity,
police official Koco Topuzovski said. Ten are in police custody and one remains
at large.
</P>
<P>
	   The three policemen were killed Jan. 11 when they tried to check a
suspicious car in Aracinovo, an Albanian-populated village a few miles east of
the capital Skopje. Aracinovo is known as the center of an Albanian-run
smuggling and crime network which has flourished in Macedonia since last year's
war in neighboring Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   The Aracinovo shootout heightened tensions -- already strained since the
Kosovo war -- between the country's majority Slavs and ethnic Albanians, who
make up about one-fourth of the 2 million population.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the shooting, police have searched dozens of houses and questioned
more than 200 people in a dragnet that has yielded arms, narcotics and
``countless pieces of material evidence in connection with the murder of the
three policemen,'' Topuzovski said.
</P>
<P>
	   The action has drawn sharp criticism from ethnic Albanian political leaders
and human rights groups who claim police used unnecessary force and conducted
searches without warrants. Many homes in Aracinovo were allegedly damaged during
the searches.

<TEXT>
    	   OCEAN CITY, N.J. (AP) - Thank goodness for Nintendo.
<P>
	   Video games, computers, VCRs and other forms of home entertainment have
taken on newfound importance as snowbound New Jerseyans cope with day after day
of school closings and work cancellations.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's been living at the TV, the computer and his video games," said Fran
Davish, 45, of Ocean City, referring to his 13-year-old son Patrick. The father
and son were outside Wednesday helping shovel a neighbor's sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
	   Video stores reported brisk business as stir-crazy people ventured out in
search of new diversions. A day after a storm dumped up to 14 inches of snow on
some New Jersey communities, the sun came out and the skies cleared.
</P>
<P>
	   But many schools remained closed. And parents of young children - some of
whom have been to school only once in the last week - were out with them,
sledding, shoveling or renting videos.
</P>
<P>
	   "Business always picks up when the weather is bad," said Scott Leopardi,
assistant manager of Blockbuster Video on 9th Street.
</P>
<P>
	   As he spoke, school-age children shopped for video rentals or games to help
break the monotony.

in three days between Republican George W. Bush and a senator campaigning for
Democrat Bill Bradley.

	   ``I'm stalking him,'' Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey cracked after bumping into
Bush at the Puritan Backroom Restaurant and Lounge, a blue-plate diner, on
Wednesday.

	   ``Hey, killer,'' said the Texas governor, shaking Kerrey's hand.
</P>
<P>
	   Kerrey complimented Bush on an address he gave at Iowa State University on
Monday, when they last met. ``It was a good speech, good speech,'' he said. ``I
don't know if that helped you in New Hampshire. You probably don't want me to
say nice things about you.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Listen, I do want you to say nice things about me,'' Bush assured him.
Kerrey replied, ``Well, you're the real thing. I trust you.''
</P>
<P>
	   In an earlier aside, Kerrey, a Vietnam veteran and former Democratic
presidential candidate, told Bush: ``The best thing about New Hampshire is I no
longer have Vietnam flashbacks, I have New Hampshire flashbacks.''

<HEADLINE> Bush, GOP Courtin Hispanics  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Targeting a traditionally Democratic group, George W.
Bush is set to run Spanish-language ads in Arizona and beyond as the Republican
Party works to attract the nation's fastest-growing population.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor is not only hunting for votes on Sen. John McCain's home
turf; he's also looking ahead to the general election and hoping to reverse the
Democrats' advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, the Republican National Committee is preparing a
multimillion-dollar ad campaign aimed at improving the party's image among
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush ads all include the tag line ``es un nuevo dia,'' meaning ``it's a
new day,'' and that's just the message Republicans hope to send.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a new day in America. There's a new leader. Positive. Inclusive,''
says a Spanish-speaking narrator in the new TV spot, which features Bush with
Hispanics in Texas. The ad will begin running next week on Spanish-language TV
stations in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
	   Hispanics gave most of their votes to President Clinton in 1992 and 1996,
and they have played pivotal roles in other races, helping elect Democrat Gray
Davis as governor of California in 1998, for instance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The challenge we have, of course, is showing George W. Bush is a new kind
of Republican,'' said Lionel Sosa, who is producing Bush's Spanish ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   It helps that Bush speaks the language. In 1998, he took half the Hispanic
vote in his Texas re-election.
</P>
<P>
	   In Iowa, Bush advertised on Spanish-language radio and in newspapers, and he
plans to run TV ads in every state that has Spanish stations, Sosa said. In
Arizona, the campaign will run its TV ad often enough that the average viewer
will see it four to six times before the primary on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls show McCain and Bush in a tight race in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's camp says he is the first presidential candidate to use Spanish TV
ads in a primary, though they have long been used in general elections. In fact,
the first came as early as 1960, when Jacqueline Kennedy spoke Spanish in an ad
for her husband, said Julian Kanter, founder of a center at the University of
Oklahoma that archives political ads.
</P>
<P>
	   They are used, he said, because they are effective.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When you speak somebody else's language, you're saying to them, 'I'm
really interested in you,''' Kanter said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican National Committee is hoping to capitalize, too. It plans to
spend $7 million to $10 million on image ads -- one in Spanish -- beginning this
spring in about 10 states.
</P>
<P>
	   It will take awhile for the message to get through, said Leslie Sanchez of
the RNC. But she said polling indicates the Hispanic vote is open to
competition.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats see Hispanics as being ``at the bottom,'' she said, whereas
Republicans are appealing to their upwardly mobile nature. ``Democrats have
allowed Hispanics to be comfortable in their own poverty,'' Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats don't accept that view and believe they can keep Hispanics under
their tent, said Jenny Backus, spokeswoman for the Democratic National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Hispanic community is more sophisticated than having someone just
speak the language and go in and pose for photos,'' she said. ``They're going to
look at the record, at what party is going to deliver for them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hispanics care deeply about education and health care, Backus said, and
polls show Democrats with the edge on these issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanchez acknowledged that Republicans have to adjust as they campaign for
Hispanic votes, and she said they have talked about these strategies among
themselves. But she agreed it's not easy. ``You're going to have people on both
sides that may or may not understand -- or support -- the effort.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans cut legal immigrants off Medicaid and food stamps, for instance,
and have tried to keep illegal immigrant children out of public schools.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, the leading GOP presidential candidates have supported
some Hispanic issues, said Cecilia Munoz of the National Council of La Raza, the
nation's largest Hispanic advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Governor Bush and Senator McCain get a lot of points for not trashing
immigrants,'' she said. ``But the best you can say is on key emotional and
substantive issues there are some mixed signals coming from the Republican
Party.''

<HEADLINE> Embalmer Gets TB From Corpse  </HEADLINE>
    By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Researchers in Baltimore have identified the first known case of an embalmer
getting tuberculosis from a corpse.
</P>
<P>
	   The finding led the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine researchers to
recommend that funeral home workers take the same precautions as medical workers
to prevent transmission of the sometimes-fatal disease.
</P>
<P>
	   The 35-year-old dead man had AIDS as well as an active infection of
tuberculosis, which is transmitted by tiny particles of respiratory secretions
that can hang in the air for hours.
</P>
<P>
	   DNA fingerprinting established that the embalmer's TB came from the dead
man, researcher Dr. Timothy Sterling said.
</P>
<P>
	   During embalming, the blood is drained and preservative fluids are injected
into the body under pressure. Secretions sometimes become airborne when fluids
gurgle through the corpse's mouth and nose or when embalming fluids are dumped
down a drain.
</P>
<P>
	   The embalmer was treated with antibiotics for six months and is now
tuberculosis-free.
</P>
<P>
	   The research was reported in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends only that
hospital workers and those performing autopsies wear gloves and masks when
handling patients or bodies.

<HEADLINE> Studies Find Flu Is Common in Kids  </HEADLINE>
    By LINDA A. JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Two large studies show the flu is a surprisingly common and often dangerous
infection in children, and researchers say routine flu shots should be
considered for youngsters.
</P>
<P>
	   The studies found few deaths but lots of hospital stays, doctor visits and
unnecessary treatment with antibiotics. This was true both for healthy children
under 2 and older, "high-risk" children with asthma, diabetes or other chronic
conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   While urging that the flu vaccine be considered for the young, the
researchers stopped short of a flat recommendation. Already, health agencies
recommend up to 16 vaccinations by age 2. Giving millions of children annual flu
shots raises questions of logistics, safety and cost-effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think there will be a change in the recommendations until all those
issues are thrashed out," said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, chief of epidemiology in the
influenza branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which
conducted one of the studies.
</P>
<P>
	   The research was reported in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   Currently, pediatric vaccination guidelines call for yearly flu shots only
for high-risk children and others in the household. Experts estimate as few as
10 percent of high-risk children get the shots.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're already giving so many immunizations. I'm not really convinced we
have enough information to justify adding this one" for all children, said Dr.
Chitra Reddy, director of the pediatric ambulatory service at New Jersey Medical
School in Newark.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Kathleen Maletic Neuzil, an infectious-disease specialist at University
of Washington in Seattle who led the other study, said routinely vaccinating
school-age children, who often bring flu home, and working parents might make
sense.
</P>
<P>
	   Flu shots cannot be given before 6 months and work poorly in the youngest
children.
</P>
<P>
	   A flu vaccine that is sprayed up the nose is under development and could
spare youngsters the pain of a shot. If the vaccine proves safe, it could lead
to new recommendations that all children get vaccinated against influenza, said
Dr. S. Michael Marcy, a specialist at Kaiser Foundation Hospital in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   Neuzil and researchers at Vanderbilt University in Nashville tracked
thousands of lower-income Tennessee children through Medicaid records from 1973
through 1993. The researchers blamed influenza for 104 hospitalizations annually
for every 10,000 children under 6 months and 50 per 10,000 kids 6-12 months old,
as well as nine courses of antibiotics and 15 emergency room or doctor's office
visits annually per 100 children ages 6-12 months.
</P>
<P>
	   Fukuda and other CDC researchers studied tens of thousands of children in
two managed-care organizations in the wealthier Seattle and San Francisco Bay
areas from 1992 to 1997. They found healthy children under age 2 were about 12
times more likely than healthy 5- to 17-year-olds to be hospitalized for acute
respiratory disease in winter.
</P>
<P>
	   In an accompanying editorial, Drs. Kenneth MacIntosh of Children's Hospital
and Tracy Lieu of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, both in Boston, said that some
cases that were counted as flu might have been other illnesses, such as
respiratory syncytial virus, which lands considerably more children in hospitals
than influenza but for which there is no vaccine.

<HEADLINE> Connecticut mayors give Dodd their wish list  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - The mayors of some of Connecticut's largest cities
have a simple request for their elected representatives in Washington: Send more
money.
<P>
	   And while they're at it, the municipal leaders could also use some help
keeping their streets safe and their schools running, the mayors told Sen. Chris
Dodd, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayors of Hartford, New Britain, East Hartford, Bridgeport, Danbury and
West Haven were in Washington on Tuesday for a meeting of the U.S. Conference of
Mayors.
</P>
<P>
	   Bridgeport, the third major U.S. city to sue the gun industry, would like
Congress to pass pending legislation strengthening gun control laws, Mayor Joe
Ganim said. If Congress dealt with the issue the city would likely drop its
lawsuit, according to Ganim.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'd walk away from money damages in a minute," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bridgeport's lawsuit was thrown out last month by a judge who said the city
had no standing to sue, a ruling the city plans to appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress could also help local school districts by offering funding for
programs like class-size reduction, Dodd said. School districts are often
crippled by the amount of money they must spend on special education, said
Danbury Mayor Gene Eriquez.
</P>
<P>
	   Communication with Dodd and other Capitol Hill lawmakers is also the key to
getting funding for smaller local projects, said West Haven's mayor, Richard
Borer.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the mayors had specific requests in mind. Eriquez, for example, is
hoping the federal government can contribute to the cost of building a sewer
system necessary for economic development of the city's west side.
</P>
<P>
	   Borer could use dollars for low-income housing.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Hartford Mayor Michael P. Peters and East Hartford Mayor Tim Larson are
looking for federal transportation money.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our mass is transit is not up to what it should be," Peters said.
</P>
<P>
	   All the mayors stressed the importance of continuing community development
block grants, which provide funding for economic development and social
programs. New Britain Mayor Lucian Pawlak credits such a grant for his city's
rebirth as "the organic farming center of New England."
</P>
<P>
	   The grants, often the target of would-be budget cutters, should be
reauthorized every two years instead of an annually as they are now, Dodd said.
</P>
<P>
	   "At least that way you'd have some stability. You may not like all the
results but at least you'd know what the results are," he told Eriquez and
Borer.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Violence Blamed on Foreigners  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Egypt's president on Wednesday blamed subversive foreign
elements for instigating recent fighting between Muslims and Christians that
escalated into the country's worst religious violence in decades.
</P>
<P>
	   President Hosni Mubarak said the culprits behind the clashes that killed 23
and injured 34 on Jan. 2 were ``pushed from abroad'' to destabilize Egypt. It
was his first detailed remarks about the violence. He declined to elaborate
pending an investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-day conflagration began Dec. 31 after an argument between a Muslim
customer and a Christian shopkeeper in the southern village of el-Kusheh.
Gunfire was exchanged and many shops and homes were burned in the violence that
spread to surrounding towns.
</P>
<P>
	   Mubarak also denied there was any discrimination against Egypt's Coptic
Christians, who form 10 percent of the country's 64 million people. The rest are
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All are Egyptians in the land of Egypt regardless of religion,'' Mubarak
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Egypt's Interior Minister Habib el-Adly was quoted Wednesday by the Middle
East News Agency as saying ``there are hidden hands in the el-Kusheh incidents
... and these hands are working toward escalating the situation.''
</P>
<P>
	   El-Adly, whose ministry is responsible for internal security, did not
identify the instigators but said ``their roles are known.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Egypt will not allow sectarian sedition,'' el-Adly was cited as saying.
The ``outside world is receiving news that is far from the truth.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although Christians and Muslims have generally lived in peace, Copts
sometimes complain of discrimination and have been attacked by Muslim
fundamentalists.

Wednesday kept GOP Sen. John McCain from being thrown off New York's Republican
presidential primary ballot in about one-quarter of the state's 31 congressional
districts.
<P>
	   But lawyers working for New York supporters of Texas Gov. George W. Bush
immediately appealed to the state courts in an attempt to have McCain delegate
slates thrown off the ballot in the disputed eight districts. A decision on the
lawsuit could come as early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The move to the courts came after the two Republican members of the state
Board of Elections voted to uphold the challenges to the McCain petitions for a
spot on the March 7 ballot. But the board's two Democrats abstained, thus
depriving the Bush camp of the third vote it needed to have the petitions
invalidated for a lack of signatures.
</P>
<P>
	   With recent polls showing McCain running ahead of Bush in New Hampshire,
which holds its first-in-the-nation primary next week, the battle over the New
York primary ballot has taken on extra significance.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, who finished second to Bush in
Monday's Iowa caucus voting, have filed petitions to qualify for New York's
primary ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   The McCain camp lauded Wednesday's development at the elections board.
</P>
<P>
	   Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari, head of McCain's New York
campaign, said the move "defends the rights of New York voters to support the
candidate of their choice ... The Bush challenges in New York have made our
party a national disgrace."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain lawyer Henry Berger, a New Yorker who normally represents Democratic
candidates, said the controversy shows why New York needs to change its election
laws.
</P>
<P>
	   "It has become not a matter of democracy, but a blood sport," Berger said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain turned to Berger after learning that state GOP Chairman William
Powers, a Bush backer who is directing the New York petition challenges, had
locked up the services of most of the Republican lawyers who are expert in the
intricacies of the state's complex election laws.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the vote, the Republican board members accused the Democrats of
prearranging the outcome. State Senate Minority Leader Martin Connor, a Democrat
and election law expert, had been quoted in The New York Times on Wednesday
saying the Democratic board members were going to keep McCain on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   "That sounds like to me that there's been a decision, a predetermination of
the vote without any consultation with the other two commissioners," said
Republican Neil Kelleher, a board member from nearby Troy.
</P>
<P>
	   But board Chairman Carol Berman said she and Commissioner Evelyn Aquila, the
two Democrats, had done no such thing.
</P>
<P>
	   "My conscience is clear," Berman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, the Democrats' refusal to vote helped cause more problem for
the Bush bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, GOP candidates must get a certain number of signatures from
party members to qualify separate convention delegate slates in each of the
state's congressional districts where they want to compete.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's New York backers, who include Gov. George Pataki, challenged McCain's
petitions in 16 of New York's congressional districts. Local election officials
in New York City and on Long Island had earlier ruled McCain off the ballot in
four of those 16 districts. Berger said he would try to get McCain reinstated in
at least two of the four districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Less than an hour after the state board's move Wednesday, lawyer Jeffrey
Buley, who works for the Bush supporters, was in state Supreme court calling the
board's failure to invalidate the petitions "capricious" and "arbitrary."
</P>
<P>
	   "It was clearly evident that the petitions were lacking the prerequisite
number of signatures," Buley, a Powers confidant, said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who had tried to qualify for the ballot in 30 of the state's 31
congressional districts with petitions, has also filed a federal court lawsuit
seeking to open up the New York ballot. The case will be heard in Brooklyn on
Friday.

<HEADLINE> Sudan President, Speaker Hold Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) -- President Omar el-Bashir held friendly discussions
with a rival party strongman who provoked him to declare a state of emergency
last month, an authoritative Sudanese newspaper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   El-Bashir met parliament speaker Hassan Turabi on Tuesday night at the
Khartoum home of a senior member of the ruling National Congress, Akhbar al-Youm
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   It was their first one-to-one meeting since el-Bashir dissolved parliament
on Dec. 12 and declared a state of emergency, accusing Turabi of undermining
him. Turabi, the chief ideologue of the ruling party and long regarded as the
country's strongman, accused the president of mounting a virtual coup.
</P>
<P>
	   In another effort to consolidate power against his rival, El-Bashir fired
his entire government on Monday and appointed a new Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper said the two politicians -- who met last week with other
officials present -- held a lengthy private discussion and affirmed the unity of
the National Congress. But the report said nothing to suggest that the president
was going to reverse his decisions of Dec. 12.
</P>
<P>
	   The participants stressed ``the importance of party unity and the
dissipation of the dark clouds that have hovered over the political scene
recently,'' the report added.
</P>
<P>
	   Legislators who support Turabi have asked the Constitutional Court to rule
on the legality of the president's dissolution of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, el-Bashir appointed Badria Suliman, an expert on Islamic law,
as the first female minister in his Cabinet. She was without portfolio.

	   Snow swept across the Plains on Wednesday, forcing dozens of Oklahoma
schools to close in anticipation of slick roads and an accumulation of several
inches.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Northeast, meanwhile, many government offices were closed for a
second day as light snow continued falling.
</P>
<P>
	   Moist air that produced heavy rain along the West Coast earlier in the week
flowed onto the Plains on Wednesday. The moisture combined with cold air to
produce snow from the Dakotas across Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Weather Service posted a winter storm watch for much of
Oklahoma and said 6 to 8 inches of snow could accumulate by the time it stops
falling Thursday. Several schools closed for the day and numerous traffic
accidents clogged roads in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   The snow showers in the Northeast were remnants of the storm that spread
heavy snow along the East Coast on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The snow was scattered across Pennsylvania and New York state and into the
New England states.
</P>
<P>
	   Farther south, light snow fell in the Appalachians in eastern Kentucky and
southern West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   A lake-effect storm fueled by moisture from Lake Michigan buried parts of
northwest Indiana under as much as 1 foot of snow.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere, light moisture was scattered over the West, with snow showers in
eastern Washington, Idaho and western Montana, and other areas of snow in
southern Utah and the Colorado Rockies. Elko, Nev., reported 6 inches of snow in
12 hours.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the snow, radar showed isolated, light rain showers moving
across parts of southern Nevada, Arizona, Utah and western Colorado.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday's temperatures around the Lower 48 states ranged from a morning
low of 17 below zero at International Falls, Minn., to a midday reading of 72 at
Harlingen, Texas.

<HEADLINE> Report: Palestinians Offer New Deal  </HEADLINE>
   By RON KAMPEAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A Palestinian proposal for a final peace settlement that
includes concessions on Jewish settlements and Jerusalem was reported Wednesday
in an Israeli newspaper -- but it was immediately repudiated as unfounded by
Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the report in Haaretz, the proposal cedes some West Bank
territory containing large blocks of Jewish settlements to Israeli sovereignty
in exchange for parts of Israel. It also reportedly offers joint administration
of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
	   Another innovation in the proposal -- reported by Haaretz to have been
unveiled by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in a meeting with President Clinton
last week -- is a backdown on refugee policy.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Haaretz, the new Palestinian proposal has Israel recognizing
the right of Palestinian refugees whose forebears left Israel during its
independence war to return -- but not actually allowing such a return in
practice.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue of refugees' right to return to Israel proper is largely symbolic
because Israel is not expected to allow it in practice. However, the refugees
are expected to be allowed to return to territories of an eventual Palestinian
state as part of a final peace deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Haaretz did not give the source of its report.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian officials said there was no basis to the report, insisting their
bottom line remains the same: a return of all Palestinian-inhabited land
captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War, a capital in east Jerusalem, and the
unequivocal right of Palestinians to return.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not true at all,'' said Yasser Abed Rabbo, one of the two lead
Palestinian negotiators. ``We didn't submit such a plan to the Americans, nor to
others, we didn't even discuss these proposals with the Israelis. This looks
like an Israeli trial balloon.''
</P>
<P>
	   Still, two of the proposals -- land trades that would allow some Jewish
settlements to remain under Israeli sovereignty, and shared administration of
Jerusalem -- date back to informal talks held by Israeli Yossi Beilin and
Palestinian Mahmoud Abbas five years ago. Both men are now in influential
positions: Beilin is Justice Minister and Abbas is a top aide to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal on refugees would be difficult for Arafat to sell to his
people. Much of his credibility over the years has been drawn from his stated
determination to defend the interests of refugee communities.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. State Department, understaffed due to unusually snowy weather in
Washington, would not comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Wednesday that the issue of returning
Palestinian refugees should wait until after final agreements were reached.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Israel is a tiny country ... When the time comes to establish a political
Palestinian entity it will be more natural for the refugees to come back,'' he
said in Stockholm, Sweden, where he is attending a conference on the Holocaust.
``I'm on principle against the coming of a single refugee as part of an
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Jerusalem, Palestinians have demanded sovereignty over the traditionally
Arab eastern part of the city, where they plan to set up a capital; Israel
insists the city will remain united.
</P>
<P>
	   The joint administration of the city outlined in Haaretz would face stiff
Israeli resistance.
</P>
<P>
	   Jerusalem's mayor, Ehud Olmert, told Israel television that such a plan is
``a recipe for eternal friction and debate.''
</P>
<P>
	   The report comes as the two sides both acknowledge the difficulty of meeting
a Feb. 13 deadline for reaching the outline of an agreement on the key issues
dividing them, including borders, Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlers and
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
	   Abed Rabbo said talks aimed at meeting the deadline would begin Sunday.

<P>
	   HALLE, Germany (AP) -- Olympic 100-meter champion Donovan Bailey of Canada,
coming back from injury, finished fourth in the 60 meters in his indoor debut of
the season Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	Roland Nemeth of Hungary won the race in 6.60 seconds, while Bailey clocked
6.65, behind Tony Dees of the United States (6.63) and Gabor Dobos of Hungary
(6.64).
</P>
<P>
	``The time is not earth-shattering,'' Bailey said. ``But for me this year, the
Olympics in Sydney are the only thing that counts.''
</P>
<P>
	Bailey ruptured an Achilles tendon in September 1998 and returned to
competitive track June 12, 1999.
</P>
<P>
	While he was healthy for most of last season, he was not in top race shape, and
his best time for the 100 was 10.19. Because the time was wind-aided, however,
it was not considered official and does not count toward qualification for
Canada's Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
	Bailey has to run the 100 in 10.23 -- the standard set by the Canadian Olympic
Association -- or better by Aug. 13 to make the team.

<HEADLINE> Duval Faces Phoenix, But No Tiger  </HEADLINE>
    By MEL REISNER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- David Duval won't have to think about Tiger Woods
at the Phoenix Open.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods, the only golfer hotter than Duval the last three years, is skipping
the raucous event. Last year, a fan heckling Woods was found to have had a
loaded pistol in a fanny pack.
</P>
<P>
	   Organizers have tightened restrictions on drinking, but the commotion from
last year did not determine Woods' decision. He simply does not like to play
more than four consecutive tournaments, and is expected to enter four next
month.
</P>
<P>
	   That leaves Duval to deal with the rest of a deep field -- and with the TPC
of Scottsdale course itself. He has had 31 top 10 finishes since 1996, but none
at Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
	   "I like playing here, and I'm surprised I haven't contended a little more
seriously than I have," Duval said about the 7,083-yard layout.
</P>
<P>
	   His final rounds have ruined his chances. In 1997, when he tied for 14th, he
followed scores of 66, 65 and 66 with a 7-over 78. He was even worse the other
years -- tied for 35th in 1996, 27th in 1998 and 18th last year after closing
with a 74.
</P>
<P>
	   But Duval is off to a strong start this season. He was second in the
Williams World Challenge, third in the Mercedes Championships behind Woods and
Ernie Els and tied for fifth in the Bob Hope on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   It's beginning to instill even more confidence in a player who has a world
of it anyway and is looking to improve his putting. He has no quarrel with those
who make him the favorite this week.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's something I think I expect of myself as well," Duval said. "So if I
don't feel like I have that opportunity when I start ... I don't think I should
be playing that week. It's not always going to work out that way, but you need
to be feeling good and you need to be thinking that way."
</P>
<P>
	   The field features Davis Love III, Vijay Singh, Chris Perry, Hal Sutton,
Justin Leonard and Jeff Maggert, who all won more than $2 million last season.
There's also Jesper Parnevik, the Hope champion and 2000 money leader with
$808,700 earned in three tournaments.
</P>
<P>
	   Parnevik won in Phoenix in 1998, and Rocco Mediate outdueled Leonard and
Woods last year for his first title in six years.
</P>
<P>
	   Duval wishes Woods -- who has never won in Phoenix -- was teeing up this
week.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I win a golf tournament, I want everybody there to feel like they have
played as well as they can," Duval said. "Because I want to think I have beaten
somebody when they are playing as well as they can.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's no different with Tiger. I want him to walk away from a tournament
that we played, and I want him to think he played the best he can and I got him.
That's kind of my attitude about it."
</P>
<P>
	   Duval briefly took the No. 1 world ranking from Woods last year after
winning four titles before the Masters. But that was the end of his hot streak.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods went on to win eight tournaments -- the last four in a row -- and
shove everyone else from the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
	   Mediate said Duval is the favorite by default.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's easier to handicap when Tiger's in the field because you can always
say he's going to win," he said. "You've got a 50-50 shot at it."

<HEADLINE> Sikhs Rebel Over Excommunication  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Four top Sikh priests challenged the authority of
their powerful leader Wednesday, rejecting his decision to excommunicate a woman
who controlled religious institutions.
</P>
<P>
	   In an unprecedented decision, Jagir Kaur was dismissed and officially
excluded a day earlier from the Sikh community by the religion's top priest,
Puran Singh, who accused her of trying to change the religion's sacred calendar.
</P>
<P>
	   But four other clerics who occupy the other top seats in the Sikh religion
rejected the decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Kewal Singh, Mohan Singh, Gurbachan Singh and Bhagwan Singh said the
decision was not valid because they had not been consulted, Press Trust of India
reported. They said it went against Sikh traditions.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaur, who had initially bowed to the decision, also defied Puran Singh on
Wednesday, saying the order was ``against Sikh norms and principles,'' the news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Puran Singh said Kaur had pushed for the adoption of an alternative calendar
developed in Canada -- the site of a large Sikh diaspora. The move was part of
what Puran Singh said was an effort to drive a wedge between India's Sikh and
Hindu religions, which for centuries have shared festivals.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaur was the first woman to head the important Sikh Gurudwara Prabhandhak
Committee, which oversees the administration of Sikh temples.
</P>
<P>
	   Sikhs excommunicated in similar fashion in the past have been tied to
pillars with ropes, ordered to wash dirty dishes and clean devotees' shoes, or
asked to hang placards around their necks declaring they were sinners.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Co-Chair To Retire  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Robert Eaton, the former
Chrysler chairman and CEO who helped orchestrate the merger with Daimler-Benz
AG, will retire from the company March 31.
</P>
<P>
	   DaimlerChrysler said Eaton, 59, gave the announcement to a meeting of senior
managers Wednesday, saying that "this is the right time for me to go."
</P>
<P>
	   "The merger is complete," Eaton said, according to a company statement. "The
structure and future leadership is in place. The two companies are one, my goal
has been accomplished."
</P>
<P>
	   When Chrysler was acquired by Daimler-Benz AG in 1998, Eaton said he would
share the job of chairman with Daimler-Benz head Juergen Schrempp for no more
than three years, then retire.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the long-term, there can be only one boss," German magazine Der Spiegel
quoted Eaton as saying in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Eaton began his career at General Motors Corp. in 1963, starting as an
engineer and working his way up to president of General Motors Europe. In 1992,
he left to join Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
	   Eaton was promoted to chairman and chief executive officer on Jan. 1, 1993,
replacing Lee Iacocca. During his tenure, Chrysler reworked itself from the
weakest of the Big Three automakers into a highly profitable company, which won
acclaim for vehicle styling.
</P>
<P>
	   But Eaton also came to believe that Chrysler could not face the future
alone, that only a handful of automakers could survive and compete globally. He
and Schrempp began talking about a possible merger at the 1998 Detroit auto
show, and announced one of the largest industrial mergers ever five months
later.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are leading a new trend we believe will change the future, the face of
the industry," Eaton said when the deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
	   The two leaders acknowledged the merger won't be easy. Their own study of
transnational mergers suggests that 70 percent failed to achieve the kind of
success that had been anticipated. Concerns were raised that the freewheeling
spirit of Chrysler was a poor fit with the regimental view of Daimler.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the merger, several top Chrysler executives have left, including
President Thomas Stallkamp.
</P>
<P>
	   Eaton worked hard to sell the merger to employees and shareholders, and to
ease concerns about culture clashes.
</P>
<P>
	   "This isn't a German or American thing, this is one company striving to be
the number one automotive transportation company in the world," Eaton said in
September.
</P>
<P>
	   Eaton had said he would retire earlier if the major hurdles of the merger
were completed. As recently as a few weeks ago, however, Eaton said in an
interview there was "no new news to report" about his status with the company.
</P>
<P>
	   In his statement Wednesday, Eaton said he was pleased with the newly
combined company's accomplishments, pointing to a 12 percent increase in revenue
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   "The first full year of DaimlerChrysler has been a great one," Eaton said.
"We sold 3.2 million Chrysler, Dodge, Plymouth and Jeep products -- more than
any other year in history.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of DaimlerChyrsler were trading down 81 1/4 cents to $67.18 3/4 in
later afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Neo-Nazi Radio Show Taken Off Air  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- A Berlin court ruled Wednesday that a public access radio
station could take a neo-Nazi radio program off the air because it violated laws
against hate speech.
</P>
<P>
	   The monthly one-hour show, hosted by 31-year-old jobless mechanic Mike
Penkert, was titled ``Radio Germania'' and regularly contained anti-Semitic
comments. The program featured information on upcoming neo-Nazi demonstrations
and talked about songs banned under German laws against spreading Nazi
propaganda.
</P>
<P>
	   Station officials asked for court approval last month to permanently remove
the program, saying they couldn't do so on their own because public access laws
allow resident to broadcast a show as long as it wasn't pornographic or
inflammatory.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Berlin's administrative court ruled that an Oct. 29 show
violated laws in Germany's constitution banning hate speech because it aired a
song from a banned neo-Nazi music group.
</P>
<P>
	   Neo-Nazi sentiment has grown in Germany in the wake of unification in 1990,
especially in the former communist East, which experts say is partially due to
high joblessness.

<HEADLINE> Belichick Drops Suit Against NFL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Bill Belichick dropped his antitrust lawsuit against
the NFL on Wednesday, a day after a judge refused to free him to negotiate to
coach other teams.
</P>
<P>
	   Belichick lost his attempt to gain a temporary restraining order against NFL
commissioner Paul Tagliabue's ruling that keeps him from coaching another team
without the New York Jets' permission.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge John Bissell ruled that Belichick could only blame
himself for his quandary after quitting the Jets.
</P>
<P>
	   "It made sense to withdraw the case and to assess our position," Belichick
lawyer David Feher said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Jets' lawyers did not immediately return telephone messages.
</P>
<P>
	   The team has left Belichick in an unworkable position, Feher said.
</P>
<P>
	   "He cannot work in the NFL because the Jets have indicated they do not want
to employ him," he said. "He is not being paid, but he's still restricted from
pursuing his livelihood."
</P>
<P>
	   Belichick's $1.4 million contract, with three years left on it, called for
him to take over the team upon head coach Bill Parcells retirement, which
happened Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
	   But Belichick stunned the team by resigning the next day, citing the
uncertainties posed by the impending sale of the team, and potential problems
from Parcells' continuing association with the team in a front-office capacity.
</P>
<P>
	   Tagliabue's ruling covers only the 2000 season and does not address the
remaining two years on Belichick's contract.

<HEADLINE> Runner Testifies About Misdiagnoses  </HEADLINE>
    By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A string of doctors failed to diagnose Gail Devers'
severe thyroid disease, despite classic symptoms, until she had dropped to 87
pounds, medical mistakes that the "fastest woman in the world" spent years
overcoming to win Olympic gold.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one should have to go undiagnosed for years with a condition that is so
serious, yet so easy to test for and treat," Devers told Congress on Wednesday,
as lawmakers struggled with how to combat medical mistakes estimated to kill up
to 98,000 hospitalized Americans a year.
</P>
<P>
	   The prestigious Institute of Medicine stunned the nation in November when it
announced that death toll and called for quick action to make health care safer.
</P>
<P>
	   The report didn't attempt to calculate how many Americans are killed by
medical mistakes outside of hospitals or have experiences like Devers', in which
mistakes injure but fortunately do not kill.
</P>
<P>
	   The institute's study stirred immediate consternation in Congress because of
two recommendations: that the nation mandate reporting of serious errors so
experts can spot patterns of problems, and that Congress create a federal Center
for Patient Safety to examine ways to prevent errors and set safety standards.
</P>
<P>
	   Some doctors' groups strongly oppose mandatory error reporting for fear it
would spur lawsuits, and some lawmakers question the need for a safety center
when federal health agencies today could research healthcare quality.
</P>
<P>
	   Nor has the Clinton administration decided how to address the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   "The public has a right to know" about serious errors and what each hospital
is doing to correct them, said Dr. Lucian Leape of the Harvard School of Public
Health, a co-author of the Institute of Medicine report.
</P>
<P>
	   A national center for aviation safety with a budget of $100 million makes
airline travel safer, and medicine deserves the same, Leape told the Senate
Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Good health workers make mistakes because they're human, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Is there anybody in this room that hasn't written '1999' on a check" this
year, he asked. When a health worker "writes down the wrong number, patients get
hurt."
</P>
<P>
	   But if experts could analyze what errors are made in which hospitals and
why, they could set up systems to prevent them instead of just firing or suing
the worker, which does no good, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   While politicians debate the issue, Devers' message Wednesday was that
average Americans can take steps to protect themselves from at least one type of
medical mistake: missed diagnoses.
</P>
<P>
	   She described how a string of doctors assumed her early symptoms of fatigue
and weight loss were normal for a world-class athlete training hard for the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, they were early signs of an overactive thyroid, a condition that in
severe cases can be life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
	   A simple $50 blood test could have diagnosed her, had Devers only known to
request it when her doctors somehow missed the symptoms.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't even know what a thyroid was," Devers said, advising Americans to
learn "the early warning signs of critical conditions" so they know what
symptoms to stress to doctors and can demand better care.
</P>
<P>
	   It all started in 1988, when Devers left her first Olympics too weak to even
make the finals. She became forgetful, her hair fell out, her trademark
talon-like fingernails broke off.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was told I was over-training and must take time off. I'd take time off
and come back even worse," she recalled.
</P>
<P>
	   Her heart rate sped up to a dangerous rate. Her eyes began to bulge. Her
skin scaled. A huge goiter grew on her neck. She dropped from 125 pounds to 87,
and then people suspected eating disorders.
</P>
<P>
	   Finally she was diagnosed with Graves' disease. By then her case was so
severe that treatment was difficult, but she went on to win gold medals for the
100-meter dash at both the 1992 and 1996 Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel Interviews Greenspan  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alan Greenspan pledged that in a fourth term he would
promote greater openness at the traditionally secretive Federal Reserve as well
as pursue the central bank's traditional goal of keeping inflation pressures
from derailing the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing for his Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday, Greenspan also
repeated his strong preference that the soaring federal surpluses be used to
reduce the national debt rather than being diverted to tax cuts or higher
spending.
</P>
<P>
	   But Greenspan did lend support to a decision the Clinton administration has
made in its new budget to seek a boost in restrictive federal spending caps in
light of the rising surpluses.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan said he would prefer that the government adhere to the current
caps that were established as part of the 1997 balanced budget law. But he said
that increasing those limits slightly to allow more government spending on
discretionary programs was preferable to engaging in "spurious mechanisms to
evade them," as Congress has done in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan, held in almost as high regard in Congress as he is on Wall
Street, breezed through his Wednesday Senate confirmation hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the committee gave him a large share of the credit for America's
current good times with the lowest unemployment rates in three decades, low
inflation and an expansion that next month will set the all-time record for
longevity.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who chairs the Banking Committee, praised
Greenspan for "doing more than anyone else on the planet" to foster the current
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
	   Gramm said he hoped to have Greenspan's nomination voted out by his
committee next Tuesday and approved by the full Senate later in the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Wall Street, which had fallen sharply Monday on fears of what Greenspan
might say in his congressional testimony this week, took Wednesday's appearance
in stride. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 3.10 at 11032.99.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan did not directly comment on what the Fed's next move might be on
interest rates. Private economists widely believe that the central bank will
boost rates at its meeting next week by a quarter point, the fourth move since
last June to slow the surging economy to keep inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
	   In his testimony before the committee, Greenspan promised to continue
efforts to allow the public greater insight into the decision-making process at
the traditionally secretive central bank.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have made considerable efforts in recent years to improve the
communication of our decisions, our expectations and their rationales to the
public," Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Starting in 1994, the Fed began releasing immediately announcements on
changes in interest rates and last week it promised to release a statement at
the end of every meeting revealing Fed thoughts on inflation dangers even if the
session does not result in a change in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Fed's primary goal to keep inflation low, Greenspan said, "Experience
has demonstrated that an essential ingredient in this prosperity, and an
ingredient for which the central bank has ultimate responsibility over the long
run, is low and stable inflation."
</P>
<P>
	   While not commenting directly on the Fed's next moves on interest rates,
Greenspan did agree with Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., that recent big increases
in the amount investors are borrowing to purchase stock, known as "buying on
margin," was worrisome.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan said that recent increases in margin borrowing to buy stock "have
caught our attention." But he said the central bank was not close to a decision
on changing its margin requirements that establish how much banks can loan to
investors to buy stocks or doing anything else to modify regulations in this
area. These limits have not been changed since 1974.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan, 73, was nominated earlier this month by President Clinton for a
fourth term as chairman of the Fed. He has headed the central bank since 1987
when Ronald Reagan selected him to succeed former Paul Volcker. He was
renominated for a second term by George Bush in 1992 and by Clinton in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   It had been expected that Clinton would offer the Fed chairmanship to
Greenspan again, given that the Republican-controlled Senate was unlikely to
approve any other appointment by a Democratic president in his last year in
office.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 3.10; Nasdaq Down 97.47  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices closed mostly lower today, as cautious
investors, fearing a pending interest rate hike, fled the technology sector
despite strong corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 3.10 at 11,032.99.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were lower. The Nasdaq composite index fell
sharply, losing 97.47 points to 4,069.94.
</P>
<P>
	   the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 3.08 to 1,406.95.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,705 up, 1,344 down and 461 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 1.12 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.06 billion in
the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.73 to 520.86.
</P>
<P>
	   "We saw a fairly big decline in the technology sector. It had been showing
signs of cracking, and it really kind of came unglued today," said Ricky
Harrington, a technical analyst with Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Market watchers said congressional testimony today by Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Alan Greenspan gave investors few signals about the direction Fed
policy makers are likely to take when they meet to discuss interest rates next
week.
</P>
<P>
	   "Investors were cautious in anticipation of Greenspan's testimony, which
might have given them an indication of where interest rates are going. But he
didn't say anything investors could latch on to one way or the other," said Paul
McEnroe, a trader at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Corporate earnings have proven strong so far, especially in the financial
services sector. J.P. Morgan was up. And brokerage firms, which benefited from a
booming fourth quarter stock market, were up across the board.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, some well-known technology companies were punished Wednesday
for not living up to investors' extraordinary expectations for the sector.
</P>
<P>
	   A case in point was cellular phone chipmaker Qualcomm. And software maker
and network storage company EMC Corp. also fell.
</P>
<P>
	   McEnroe said it appeared as if some investors were rotating money out of
newer technology stocks into more established companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said President Clinton's State of the Union address, slated for
Thursday, was also making investors cautious.

<HEADLINE> Canada Conservatives Confer  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM COHEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- In a political gamble intended to wrest power from the
governing Liberal Party, Canadian conservatives begin a conference Thursday to
decide the policies and name for a new party.
</P>
<P>
	   The initiative started by Reform Party leader Preston Manning has a clear
objective -- bringing together the divided Canadian right to create a party that
can topple the Liberals in the next national election, likely to be held in
2001.
</P>
<P>
	   But Manning faces opposition from within his Reform Party and from some in
the Conservative Party -- Canada's two major parties of the right. Failure to
forge unity would likely mean Manning's downfall after 13 years as a rising
force in Canadian politics.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Alternative conference runs through Saturday, followed by an
accompanying Reform Party national conference on Saturday and Sunday, also in
Ottawa. No matter what happens at the two gatherings, the final answer on
whether the new party successfully unites the right won't be known until Reform
Party members vote in March on whether to join.
</P>
<P>
	   Manning's supporters say he can pull it off. They cite his political acumen
in helping the Reform Party become the official opposition in Parliament by
winning 60 seats in the 301-member House of Commons in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   But all of the party's support comes from western provinces, and its
reputation for xenophobia and other socially conservative stances makes the
Reform Party largely unpalatable to Canada's liberal-leaning mainstream. It has
no Parliament members from Ontario, the most populous province, or anywhere
further east.
</P>
<P>
	   The Reform Party began in 1987 as a protest movement by western Canadians
who said they were being ignored by the federal government. Now Manning wants it
to expand beyond its core support base to become a national party capable of
winning him the prime minister's post.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's kind of a Catch 22,'' said Lawrence LeDuc, a political science
professor at the University of Toronto. ``The (Reform) party needs the West --
that's where its roots are -- but it's got to grow past it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The unity conference is expected to approve more mainstream policies for the
new party. In a signal of potential change, a conference policy document accepts
Canada's two national languages of French and English, and recognizes the
federal government's responsibility to protect minority language rights. The
Reform Party previously opposed special official status for the French language.
</P>
<P>
	   While some Conservative Party officials support the plan to merge with
Reform, Conservative leader Joe Clark opposes it. Clark and Manning are longtime
rivals who both have ambitions to be prime minister, and their power struggle is
a major obstacle to unifying the Canadian right.

<HEADLINE> Parties Urge Caution on Surplus  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Congressional Budget Office's forecast that lawmakers
could have an enormous $1.9 trillion federal surplus to dispense over the next
decade has triggered a similar response from Republicans and Democrats: Caution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't see the U.S. Senate rushing now to say, 'The candy store is open,
let's dive in and spend everything in sight,''' Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said
Wednesday at a Senate Budget Committee hearing. ``We're going to have to make
hard choices.''
</P>
<P>
	   A day after Congress' official budget scorekeeper practically doubled the $1
trillion estimate of excess tax dollars that it made only last July, most
lawmakers declined to demand correspondingly bigger tax cuts or spending
increases.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, many began this election year by emphasizing the need to use the
money to reduce the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the most important thing really does involve the budget, keeping a
balanced budget, not dipping into Social Security, and continuing to reduce the
national debt,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While I support both tax cuts that are targeted and a (Medicare)
prescription drug benefit, I think we should make it a priority to reduce the
national debt,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, ranking Democrat on
the Senate Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   To be sure, both parties are readying rival agendas of tax cuts and spending
increases that they will push in Congress and the presidential campaign trail,
partly to draw political contrasts for the voters.
</P>
<P>
	   But with polls showing that people consider debt reduction a top priority --
and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan saying it is the best use for budget
surpluses -- many lawmakers see trimming the $5.7 trillion national debt as the
safest path politically this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Underlining that, Clinton has said he will propose eliminating the $3.7
trillion in publicly held debt by 2013, while House Republicans want to erase it
no later than 2015. The publicly held debt is owed by people and institutions
who hold government bonds, while the remaining $2 trillion in debt is money in
the Social Security and other trust funds that the government, in effect, owes
itself.
</P>
<P>
	   Another attraction debt reduction holds for lawmakers is that it is what
automatically happens to budget surpluses that are not used for tax cuts or
higher spending. With President Clinton and Congress likely to block each
other's highest profile tax and spending proposals this year, lawmakers who
support debt reduction will be able to declare victory if a deadlock occurs this
fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking ahead to that gridlock -- and linking it to their hopes for a
Republican president next year -- Republicans are talking about limiting their
tax cut effort this year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whether we do it this year or reserve it for another year, it is
inconceivable to me the American taxpayer doesn't deserve some of this money,''
said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporting debt reduction can also be a way for each party to try blocking
the other side's budget plans by accusing them of trying to use the money for a
less worthy cause.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think a lot of this talk, a newfound desire to pay down the debt, is
just a way of covering up the opportunities and denying opportunities for tax
relief at the same time,'' Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn., said of Democratic calls for
debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   Of course, ever-growing surplus projections could make it easier for the two
sides to achieve some of their budget goals while still saving the bulk of the
surplus for debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, some Democrats could back tax-cutting efforts led by
Republicans, such as reducing the additional taxes many couples must pay because
they are married.
</P>
<P>
	   And many Republicans are ready to join Democratic calls for higher spending.
House GOP leaders plan to announce Thursday that they will produce their own
version of President Clinton's proposal to provide prescription drug coverage
for senior citizens.

<HEADLINE> Jefferson Likely Dad of Slave Child  </HEADLINE>
   By KIA SHANT'E BREAUX Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- More than a year after a DNA test suggested
that Thomas Jefferson may have had a son by his slave Sally Hemings, the
foundation that owns Jefferson's home acknowledged that he probably was the
father of one, if not all six, of her children.
</P>
<P>
	   The Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation, which owns Monticello, released
its findings Wednesday in response to an October 1998 DNA test that concluded a
Jefferson male likely fathered Hemings' youngest son, Eston.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Although paternity cannot be established with absolute certainty, our
evaluation of the best evidence available suggests the strong likelihood that
Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings had a relationship over time that led to the
birth of one, and perhaps all, of the known children of Sally Hemings,'' Daniel
P. Jordan, the foundation's president, said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whether it was love or lust, rape or romance, no one knows and it's
unlikely that anyone will ever know,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jefferson, who was president from 1801 to 1809, was accused publicly in 1802
of fathering several children by Hemings. Scholars have been divided over the
issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's about time that someone is validating what oral history has confirmed
for years,'' Shay Banks-Young, a Hemings descendant who lives in Columbus, Ohio,
said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
	   James Truscott, head of the Monticello Association, a group of descendants
from Jefferson's daughters Martha Jefferson Randolph and Maria Jefferson Eppes,
declined to comment because he had not seen the foundation's report.
</P>
<P>
	   Truscott's group is planning to release its own report on the issue this
year. The Monticello Association generally has not embraced the idea that
Jefferson and Hemings had a sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
	   James Truscott's nephew Lucian Truscott IV -- who stirred controversy in the
Monticello Association when he invited the Hemings family to an annual meeting
-- said his family's group will have a hard time coming up with evidence more
compelling than Wednesday's report.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think this report is a significant step forward. This is like the Civil
Rights Act for the Hemings family,'' he said. ``It's what I believe and it's
what the Hemings have known for 200 years.''
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after the 1998 DNA study was released, Jordan appointed a research
committee at the Jefferson Memorial Foundation to study the relationship.
Committee members reviewed historical and scientific documents and talked with
descendants of Monticello slaves and others with knowledge of the
Jefferson-Hemings connection.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe it represents the most extensive compilation ever of what is
known and not known about this complex and consequential topic,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
	   The report concluded that the results of the DNA test, conducted by retired
pathology professor Eugene Foster of Charlottesville, were valid.
</P>
<P>
	   After the DNA study came out, some had suggested the real father of Eston
Hemings might have been the president's brother Randolph or one of Randolph's
six sons.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee found that it was unlikely that any of those Jefferson males
fathered Hemings' children because there is no evidence the men were at
Monticello when she became pregnant. Lucia Stanton, a senior research historian
at Monticello, said Hemings conceived her children at times when Thomas
Jefferson was at Monticello.
</P>
<P>
	   The research committee's chairwoman, Dianne Swann-Wright, noted that
Jefferson freed all of Hemings' children when they were adults -- a highly
unusual move for that time. According to the committee's report, Jefferson gave
freedom to no other slave family.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that speaks for itself,'' Swann-Wright said.

<P>
	   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Four months after Hurricane Floyd's devastating
floodwaters, North Carolina struggled Wednesday with the aftermath of a ``white
hurricane'' -- a record 2-foot snowfall in a part of the country that doesn't
have much experience with blizzards.
</P>
<P>
	   The snowstorm left thousands of people stuck in cold, dark homes and
paralyzed Raleigh and other communities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm 45 years old and I've never seen it like this. Our fire trucks
couldn't go anywhere. Our ambulances couldn't go anywhere,'' said Rick Harris,
emergency management coordinator in rural Montgomery County, outside Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
	   Floyd drenched eastern North Carolina with 20 inches of rain Sept. 16 and
caused at least 51 deaths in the worst flooding in state history. Monday night's
snowstorm, accompanied by ice and winds, knocked down trees and plunged homes
and businesses into darkness.
</P>
<P>
	   Raleigh Mayor Paul Coble, snowbound Wednesday like many of his constituents,
described the storm in terms people in North Carolina are certain to understand:
``a white hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
	   More than 140,000 homes and business remained without electricity Wednesday
in North and South Carolina. The storm was blamed for one traffic death in North
Carolina and two in South Carolina. Two people were found outside dead of
exposure in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Anne Beach, pastor of the Biscoe Presbyterian Church in Montgomery
Couty, said her church shelter was running out of food to feed people whose
homes lost electricity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have plenty of cans of soup, but nothing much to go with it,'' she
said. ``I'm just praying for the loaves and the fishes to multiply.''
</P>
<P>
	   The storm dumped 20.3 inches at Raleigh-Durham International Airport,
breaking Raleigh's previous single-storm record of 17.8 inches from March 2,
1927. It also set a record for snowfall in a month, giving Raleigh a total of
28.2 inches. The previous mark was 20 inches, in January 1893.
</P>
<P>
	   Travel was especially treacherous along Interstate 85 just south of the
Virginia-North Carolina line. The road was virtually shut down for several hours
Tuesday night and Wednesday morning by jackknifed and abandoned
tractor-trailers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Raleigh-Durham airport was closed until Thursday morning. Spokesman Mike
Blanton said 120 people were stranded in the airport's two terminals Tuesday and
Wednesday, but a hotel chain fed them at no charge.
</P>
<P>
	   Blanton said the airport was closed for several hours during Hurricane Floyd
in September and Hurricane Fran in 1996, but never for two days.
</P>
<P>
	   The nor'easter swept up the East Coast from South Carolina, dropping heavy
snow inland. The Northeast got up to 2 feet of snow, which snarled roads and
closed schools and government offices, but most places were almost back to
normal on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Raleigh and Richmond, Va., which got 11 inches, were still largely paralyzed
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My guess is from what they're saying is it's going to be Sunday before you
start to see any real movement,'' the Raleigh mayor said.
</P>
<P>
	   Stewart McGough, a First Union Bank employee from Charlotte, described
downtown Richmond as a ghost town when he arrived Tuesday night after several
hours of treacherous travel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was like a war zone -- a demilitarized zone of sorts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   National Guardsmen in Humvees in North Carolina and Virginia helped state
troopers reach traffic accidents. The vehicles also served as ambulances and
helped take people to shelters.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Raleigh residents emerged from their houses and apartments Wednesday
for the first time since snow began falling Monday night. About 80 people got in
line outside a supermarket, where managers permitted only a few customers inside
at a time because only a few employees had come to work.
</P>
<P>
	   Some customers needed supplies; others were just breaking the monotony of
being inside for more than a day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's fun for the first couple of days, but then it becomes a nuisance,''
said Eric Ricks, who was in line with his fiancee, Denise Edwards.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards said she had spent her enforced confinement working on wedding
plans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've got him cornered to do the invitations,'' she said. ``I'm addressing
them, and he's stuffing them.''

<HEADLINE> Energy Acts To Ease Oil Price Surge  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department will delay deliveries to its
emergency oil reserve in hopes of easing the recent surge in fuel prices and
will closely monitor heating oil markets, Secretary Bill Richardson said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration has been under pressure to act as oil prices have edged
close to $30 a barrel from a low of less than $12 a barrel a year ago. Also,
heating oil and diesel fuel prices have risen rapidly.
</P>
<P>
	   The department will renegotiate contracts to postpone delivery on 5 million
barrels of oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in Louisiana and Texas, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Given today's market conditions, it simply makes sense,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
	   The action is intended to put more oil into the market and ease prices. But
many economists question whether it would have much impact.
</P>
<P>
	   The move came a day after Richardson ruled out releasing oil already in the
emergency reserve to influence the oil markets, saying the reserve should be
used to deal with supply emergencies and should not be used to manipulate the
markets. No withdrawal from the reserve is planned, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The government is in the process of accepting 28 million barrels of oil as a
``royalty-in-kind'' payment from producers drilling on government land. About 10
million barrels have been delivered, but delivery of the next 5 million barrels
will be postponed, Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The companies have indicated a willingness to discuss putting additional
oil into the SPR (later) if we postpone delivery dates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Energy experts question whether a relatively small release of oil from the
reserve or diversion of deliveries greatly would affect prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Ebel, director of energy and natural security at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, said only a huge
release of oil would have a major effect.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think that's politically doable,'' Ebel said at a recent energy
conference.
</P>
<P>
	   The reserve holds about 580 million barrels, equivalent to 62 days of oil
imports.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said his department would more closely monitor the heating oil
markets to ``make certain that ... oil product suppliers can move heating oil to
those who need it most.''
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said he planned to meet next month in Boston with state officials
and industry representatives to examine why the rise in heating oil prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Wednesday, the president of the American Trucking Associations urged
President Clinton to withdraw oil from the government reserves to counter
soaring prices in diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
	   Walter McCormick, the ATA's president, said in a letter that diesel fuel,
which is made from the same distillate as heating oil, jumped 47 percent the
past year, including an 11-cent increase last week. Heating oil prices have
nearly doubled in some parts of the Northeast in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Richardson said the president would seek $154 million in the 2001
budget to help poor families make their homes more energy efficient. The
administration since 1997 had sought that amount each year, but Congress has
provided less each time, including $135 million this year.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, the White House announced it was making an additional $45
million available for low-income families to purchase heating oil. The money is
going to Northeast states and Alaska.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Prepare for Debate  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore wore President Clinton's
economic legacy as a badge of honor into Wednesday night's Democratic debate,
talking of their ``historic successes'' together. Bill Bradley moved to pre-empt
any notion that the ``Live Free or Die'' state is do-or-die for him.
</P>
<P>
	   As the Democratic presidential rivals prepared to debate for the last time
before next Tuesday's first-in-the-nation primary, Gore tried to score some
points on overhauling welfare in time for the evening news and first-edition
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Gore and Bradley are battling for independents who could prove decisive
in next Tuesday's New Hampshire presidential primary. Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, a
Gore supporter, said Wednesday the Democratic race is ``very close -- it could
go either way.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the Electropac computer plant earlier, Gore recalled that Bradley voted
in the Senate against the Republican welfare overhaul that Clinton signed in
1996 and that is popular with independents and moderate Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would call upon him -- and I will do so in the debate this evening -- to
change his position, get with the program of welfare reform that works,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, who has boomeranged between shunning Clinton and embracing him, timed
his welfare remarks to coincide with a Clinton announcement from the White House
on new child-support measures, which Gore calls ``the next generation of welfare
reform.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley campaigned at a YMCA day care center to emphasize his agenda for
middle-class working families. Calling Gore ``a politician who is nothing but
tactics,'' Bradley said he is the stronger Democratic candidate because he is
``someone who can beat the Republican in the fall.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley aides, seeking to mount a comeback from his sound defeat in Iowa,
said they would release Bradley's long-range campaign plans -- effectively
giving Gore written notice that Bradley would not be forced out of the
nomination race no matter how New Hampshire votes on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   In the hours before the debate, the Democrats used surrogates to carry on a
sibling-like spat over negative campaigning and who started it.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., and Niki Tsongas, widow of 1992 presidential
candidate Paul Tsongas, held a press conference on Bradley's behalf to accuse
Gore of choosing the ``low road in American politics.'' At Electropac, the
computer company, Gore aides scrambled to keep reporters there for a ``special
guest,'' who turned out to be the husband of the governor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've seen a lot of negative campaigns and I can tell you this is not a
negative campaign,'' William Shaheen said. The Gore campaign maintains it is
Bradley who's turned negative.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's drive for New Hampshire includes spending about $20,000 on a
half-hour TV ``infomercial'' to air here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Both camps put up a new round of 30- and 60-second ads on Wednesday.
Bradley's radio ad touted his endorsement by 11 New Hampshire newspapers. Gore
has won endorsement from three papers in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president used a TV spot called ``Going Strong'' and a radio ad by
Shaheen to claim credit for the current record-breaking economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``New Hampshire's economy is working again,'' Shaheen says in the ad. ``And
Al Gore has the experience and the plan to keep it going.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore sounded his fiscal-prudence note when reporters asked about new, even
bigger budget surplus projections released Wednesday by the Congressional Budget
Office. Noting a possible $1.9 trillion surplus over the next decade, Gore
cautioned: ``Our priority should be on paying down the debt, making sure we keep
the economy strong, keep interest rates low and give the Fed plenty of
flexibility to keep monetary policy supportive of the continuation of this
economic recovery.''

<HEADLINE> La. Dome To Host New Bowl Game  </HEADLINE>
    By BRETT MARTEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The Louisiana Superdome, already home to the Sugar Bowl,
would host an earlier bowl game matching the Sun Belt Conference champion
against an at-large team in 2001 under a plan unveiled Wednesday by the Greater
New Orleans Sports Foundation.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite grumblings that the 24 existing bowl games already too many, the
foundation is confident its application will be received well by the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
	   "The NCAA has given us the indication that conference champions need a bowl
game," foundation president Jay Cicero said.
</P>
<P>
	   NCAA spokesmen could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Conference commissioner Wright Waters called the prospect of an automatic
bowl berth "a dream come true for our league."
</P>
<P>
	   "We've seen what happens to programs when they get an opportunity for
post-season play and we expect to see the same from our programs; we expect to
see them grow," Waters said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sun Belt Conference, founded as a basketball league in 1976-77, will for
the first time field seven football teams in 2001: Arkansas State, Idaho,
Louisiana-Lafayette, Louisiana-Monroe, Middle Tennessee State, New Mexico State
and North Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   The bowl game will be called the New Orleans Bowl until the foundation
agrees to a deal with a title sponsor, Cicero said, adding that TV negotiations
were underway with ESPN.
</P>
<P>
	   The game would be played during the third week in December -- before teams
arrive in New Orleans for the Sugar Bowl.

<HEADLINE> UN Reaches Deal on Iraq Arms Chief  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Hans Blix, the retired chief of the U.N. nuclear
watchdog agency, is slated to become the new lead U.N. weapons inspector for
Iraq -- a compromise appointment that raised questions Wednesday even before it
was formalized.
</P>
<P>
	   The Security Council gave its unanimous approval to the Swede after a
tortuous month of negotiation to find a candidate all 15 members could agree on.
After consultations Wednesday morning, U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke
announced that consensus had been reached and Secretary-General Kofi Annan
formally nominated Blix.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let those who saw divisions in the international community know that I am
speaking now on behalf of a united, unanimous Security Council,'' said
Holbrooke, the current council president.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia, France and China last week rejected Annan's first nominee, Rolf
Ekeus, who headed the first inspection agency in Iraq until he became Sweden's
U.S. ambassador in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   France proposed Blix in a bid to compromise and the United States lukewarmly
went along for the sake of consensus, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
	   Blix, who was vacationing in Antarctica and unavailable for comment, will
lead the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, which was
created by the Security Council in December to replace the Special Commission.
The commission pulled out of Iraq ahead of U.S. and British airstrikes in
December 1998 and was barred from returning.
</P>
<P>
	   While U.N. officials and ambassadors alike praised the council's unanimous
consensus, some diplomats and arms control experts raised doubts about whether
Blix would be aggressive enough to uncover whatever remains of Iraq's weapons
program.
</P>
<P>
	   Blix, a former Swedish foreign minister, was director general of the
International Atomic Energy Agency from 1981 until he retired in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The IAEA had been conducting regular inspections in Iraq as called for by
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty well before the agency was charged in 1991
with helping to uncover and destroy Iraq's banned weapons program.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet prior to 1991, the IAEA had discovered no evidence of Iraq's nuclear
weapons program. It was only after more intrusive inspections were launched and
documents found that the extent of the program became known.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For (Blix) to be credible he's going to have to pledge to take a much
tougher line than the IAEA has done in insisting upon solid evidence to support
Iraqi claims,'' said Paul L. Leventhal, president of the Nuclear Control
Institute, a frequent critic of the IAEA's work in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   And Iraq raised questions about its willingness to cooperate with the new
weapons inspection agency altogether, saying the resolution that created the
agency was ``unworkable.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Devil or angel, the new chairman will not change much in the scheme which
has been prepared by the United States,'' Iraqi Ambassador Saeed Hasan said.
``This resolution is not implementable, is not working and will not work.''
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq, however, has generally been more responsive to the IAEA, which was
much less confrontational than the Special Commission in uncovering Iraq's
weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
	   One British official, acknowledging the criticism of Blix's IAEA record,
said he could be a more effective inspector at the new commission because he has
a broader set of rules under which to operate.
</P>
<P>
	   Whereas the IAEA relies on countries to disclose information about their
weapons programs, the new agency, like its predecessor, allows for more
intrusive inspections.

<HEADLINE> Feds Brief Mayors on Education  </HEADLINE>
   By ANJETTA McQUEEN AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Giving the nation's mayors a preview of federal education
proposals to fix crumbling schools and attract better teachers, the Clinton
administration Wednesday promised to address the burgeoning local costs of
educating disabled children.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The federal government must pay more of its share,'' Education Secretary
Richard Riley said at the U.S. Conference of Mayors meeting here. ``The federal
government is where the decision was made to raise the level of the education of
disabled children.''
</P>
<P>
	   Riley did not provide a specific dollar amount the president would request
in the fiscal 2001 budget for the 1975 Individuals with Disabilities Education
Act.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 6 million children nationwide receive special education instruction
and services costing $60 billion. About $5 billion of that money comes from the
federal government. The other $55 billion comes from states and local districts,
which follow strict rules stemming from the federal law.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This often pulls money away from programs that serve children who are not
disabled,'' said Mayor Lee R. Clancey of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Last year, the
Supreme Court ruled the school district in Cedar Rapids had to pay an extra
$30,000 a year for one-on-one nursing for a paralyzed student. ``That money has
got to come from somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
	   Riley told the mayors' panel on education and labor issues that serving
disabled children is important. But the administration also must address
education issues such as teacher hiring, classroom technology, college aid and
school construction, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The neediest districts will be able to fix their crumbling schools with a
proposed $1.3 billion in federal grants and loans as seed money, Riley said. The
education secretary was referring to a renovation plan to be included in the
fiscal 2001 budget President Clinton will send to Congress on Feb. 7. Clinton
will also request more interest-free bonds for school improvements. The interest
on the bonds is paid through federal tax credits.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan, which is not expected to be embraced by the GOP-controlled
Congress, is winning support from larger cities with crumbling school buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need modern school facilities as well as equipment for the technology
age,'' said Mayor Douglas Palmer of Trenton, N.J. ``Some of our schools were
built at the turn of the century. We need government help even if it's assisting
with the debt service on the bonds.''
</P>
<P>
	   The mayors also support more federal funding for youth job training
programs.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Practices Address  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two years ago, the Monica Lewinsky scandal was exploding.
Last year, the impeachment drama kept tensions high. This year, the most
memorable aspect of President Clinton's State of the Union address Thursday
night may simply be that it's his last.
</P>
<P>
	   One final time, the president will stand before a joint session of Congress
to deliver a nationally broadcast speech outlining his agenda. He will offer an
election-year potpourri of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of education
and health programs and tax breaks for the working poor.
</P>
<P>
	   Wedged between the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary and the clatter
of campaign debates, Clinton's proposals will have to compete with the promises
of the men who want to succeed him. Republican leaders already have warned that
this is not the year to deal with big, new initiatives because members of
Congress will have to spend extra time at home campaigning.
</P>
<P>
	   But Clinton is unlikely to be deterred. He already has leaked many costly
proposals, repackaging initiatives from past years that never became law. In
some cases, Clinton has doubled or even tripled the size of stalled programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The biggest suspense about Clinton's speech may be how long he will talk.
Last year, the president spoke for 77 minutes. His record for a State of the
Union address was in 1995 when he spoke for 81 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday's speech will be ``very long,'' presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president went through some last-minute practices with his staff,
tinkering with passages and explaining why he rewrote certain phrases.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president will focus on the successful strategy of the last seven
years of turning the economy around, of renewing faith in this country, both in
ourselves and our government,'' Lockhart said. ``He'll spend some time focusing
on unfinished business and he'll look ahead at the challenges that face us both
in the next year and the next century.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's job is a lot easier because of the booming economy and the flood
of tax revenues that have pushed the projected budget surplus to $1.9 trillion
over the next decade. He is sure to boast that America's economic expansion,
beginning in February, will be the longest in its history.
</P>
<P>
	   That gives Clinton and Congress a lot of room to maneuver over spending and
cutting taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton and the Republicans both portray themselves as dedicated to
eliminating the government's entire $3.6 trillion federally held debt while
spending money on programs and tax breaks they feel are worthy. Clinton said
Tuesday that his budget, which will be disclosed on Feb. 7, will show how to
wipe out that debt by 2013 -- two years sooner than the Republicans' goal.
</P>
<P>
	   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill, and his top lieutenants challenged
Clinton in a letter Tuesday to use Thursday's speech to detail how he'll pay off
the debt.
</P>
<P>
	   They also called on the president to declare that he will use 100 percent of
the Social Security trust fund solely for retirement security, and to pledge
that he will sign ``meaningful and responsible tax fairness'' into law,
including relief from the so-called ``marriage penalty tax.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Clinton vetoed the Republicans' $792 billion tax-cut package.
</P>
<P>
	   The president said earlier this week he felt nostalgic about giving his
final State of the Union address. ``It's something I'm very much trying to fight
off.''
</P>
<P>
	   Technically, Clinton could deliver another State of the Union address before
leaving office on Jan. 20, 2001, but aides say this is his last one.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, Americans tuned in to see if Clinton would make any mention in his
speech of the unfolding scandal over his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. He
ignored the controversy, urging Congress to ``save Social Security first''
before cutting taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, the president's speech fell in between his impeachment by the
House and his later acquittal by the Senate. He did not mention that
controversy, either, but challenged Republicans and Democrats to work in a
spirit of bipartisanship.

	   Philip Morris' Earnings Increase
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Philip Morris Cos. Inc.'s profit edged up 2.7
percent in the fourth quarter as higher prices boosted results from
its industry-leading U.S. tobacco business even though it sold
fewer cigarettes. The maker of the top-selling Marlboro brand also
reported improved performances from its Kraft food business and its
Miller Brewing unit. But the results were slightly below Wall
Street expectations, and Philip Morris shares skidded, falling 1

	   DETROIT (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Robert Eaton, the
former Chrysler chairman and CEO who helped orchestrate the merger
with Daimler-Benz AG, will retire from the company March 31.
DaimlerChrysler said Eaton, 59, gave the announcement to a meeting
of senior managers today, saying that ``this is the right time for
me to go.'' Eaton said the merger is complete and his goal has been
accomplished. When Chrysler was acquired by Daimler-Benz AG in
1998, Eaton said he would share the job of chairman with
Daimler-Benz head Juergen Schrempp for no more than three years,
then retire. Eaton had said he would retire earlier if the major
hurdles of the merger were completed.

Sprint agreed to be acquired by MCI WorldCom in October. Deutsche

makers will discuss next week. President Clinton's nomination of

	   Ford Earns $1.8B in Fourth Quarter
</P>
<P>
	   DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- The U.S. appetite for trucks and sport
utility vehicles led Ford Motor Co. to end a banner year with an 8
percent increase in fourth-quarter operating earnings. But while
Ford and General Motors Corp. pumped up their profits to new highs
on North American sales last year, they were far less successful
elsewhere around the globe, where competition is fierce and buyers
are finicky. Ford also warned that a lack of U.S. capacity could
make earnings targets for the first quarter of this year hard to

job cuts announced today will affect 2,500 positions at the

	   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Camera and film maker Polaroid earned
$28.5 million in the fourth quarter, bouncing back from a loss of
$75.5 million a year ago. Strong demand for cameras was a major
factor. Revenues rose to $649.8 million in the quarter ending Dec.
31, up 20 percent from the $541.8 million sales figure from the
fourth quarter of 1998. Polaroid sold 9.7 million instant cameras
and more than 400,000 digital cameras last year. New products like
the I-Zone Instant Pocket Camera, JoyCam, and the Photo MAX line of
digital cameras helped fuel the better results.

firm. Earnings in the October-December period, excluding a
restructuring charge for eliminating the production of novelty

share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected profits of 68 cents a
share. Including special items, such as asset writedowns and

<HEADLINE> Dollar Down Against Yen, Euro  </HEADLINE>
    By PETER ALAN HARPER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The euro slipped briefly below parity with the dollar at
least twice today before edging higher against the U.S. currency in late
trading. The Japanese yen also gained against the dollar in markets preoccupied
with the euro's gyrations.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think there's been more focus in the U.S. session in getting the euro
through parity. I think the yen has kind of drifted into the background," said
John Beerling, chief dealer at Norwest Bank Corp. in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
	   In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0013, up from $1.0012
Tuesday. The dollar was quoted at 105.73 Japanese yen, down from 105.89.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro has faltered since its launch a year ago January, hitting its
lowest level yet against the dollar, 99.87 cents, during trading on Tuesday.
Investors have been betting that there would be no support for the euro from the
leaders of the 11-nation European region that adopted the currency at the start
of last year.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday afternoon, the euro dipped twice below $1 but rose within
seconds during some quick buying. Beerling said investors appeared to be waiting
to pounce at that level.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro was tested in a quiet market. There was no apparent impact on
foreign exchange markets from congressional testimony by Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan at hearings on his renomination.
</P>
<P>
	   "The entire North American session had virtually no range to it," Beerling
said. "The activity was at a snail's pace."
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar also was quoted at 1.6103 Swiss francs, up from 1.6069, and
1.4377 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4370. The British pound fell to $1.6380 from
$1.6460.
</P>
<P>
	   Currencies of the countries participating in the euro are no longer traded
separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. Based on the euro's rate,
the dollar was worth: 1.9533 German marks, up from 1.9524; 6.5511 French francs,
up from 6.5481; and 1,933.76 Italian lire, up from 1.932.89.

<HEADLINE> Pataki proposes expanding Lobbying Commission staff  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - With tougher new lobbying guidelines to enforce,
Gov. George Pataki said Wednesday the state's Lobbying Commission needs more
staffers.
<P>
	   The governor said the 30-day amendments he will make to his 2000-01 budget
plan will propose spending another $400,000 on the Lobbying Commission in the
next fiscal year - bringing the commission's total budget to over $1 million -
and hiring 11 more employees.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're going to have a lot more work," Pataki said. "We have a tougher
lobbying law."
</P>
<P>
	   Among the changes instituted in December when the Legislature and governor
extended the life of the commission by eight years, were more stringent
reporting requirements by lobbyists and more careful auditing of the expense
reports they file by the commission.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the Lobbying Commission will also begin monitoring the spending
lobbyists do to influence local governments beginning in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   One government reform advocate questioned whether $400,000 and 11 new
employees would be enough.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think it probably should be more than that," Blair Horner of the New
York Public Interest Research Group said. "It's bare bones and our guess is that
probably the commission will need more."
</P>
<P>
	   The lobbying laws were extended and somewhat strengthened, in part, thanks
to revelations that Philip Morris' lobbyist in Albany spent tens of thousands of
dollars on legislators she had not properly reported to the commission.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki revealed a few of the amendments he plans to file with the
Legislature on Monday. He said all of the changes have not yet been finalized,
but that the bottom line total of his budget proposal - just under $77 billion -
will not be affected by the amendments.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki said the amendments will be filed with the Legislature 17 days
earlier than he has to by law and he called on lawmakers to use that head start
to move toward passing a new budget by the April 1 start of the next state
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the other amendments outlined by Pataki were:
</P>
<P>
	   -Adding $1 million to begin process of redeveloping Governor's Island in New
York Harbor in conjunction with New York City and the federal government.
</P>
<P>
	   -Adding $500,000 for a new class of about 20 environmental conservation
officers and forest rangers.
</P>
<P>
	   -Adding $150,000 to add three new staffers at the Adirondack Park Agency.
Pataki said the agency has a backlog of more than 1,000 permit applications that
the new employees would help clear.
</P>
<P>
	   -Adding $100,000 for cleaning up non-indigenous weeds in Lake Champlain in
conjunction with other state agencies, the state of Vermont and the federal
government.

<HEADLINE> Investor Borrowing Concerns Fed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Wednesday
the central bank is worried about recent high levels of borrowing by investors
to buy stocks and that the central bank has been studying the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan said the Fed is reluctant, however, to exercise its authority to
tighten limits on such borrowing, a practice known as buying on margin. Studies
have suggested that a rising level of stock prices is unrelated to liberal
margin requirements, he told the Senate Banking Committee during his nomination
hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors buy securities on margin by borrowing part of the purchase price
from their brokerage firm and putting up the securities as collateral for the
loan. If the stock then plunges and the investor can't come up with more money,
the broker may sell the stock at a loss to cover the loan. Such selling in a
declining market could aggravate any big selloff.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have been reluctant to move margin requirements which clearly would have
no effect on large investors" who can get credit to trade stocks in other ways,
Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed hasn't changed margin requirements since 1974.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan acknowledged, though, that upward spikes in margin levels in
November and December cited at the hearing by Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., had
caught the Fed's attention and had been studied.
</P>
<P>
	   When Schumer asked whether the Fed was worried about the apparent trend,
Greenspan answered, "Obviously, we are. ... If we were not worried we would not
be studying it."
</P>
<P>
	   Schumer said some people active on Wall Street had told him they "are truly
troubled by this."
</P>
<P>
	   Last April, the brokers' group that operates the Nasdaq Stock Market warned
investors about excessive use of margin borrowing as roller-coaster swings in
the market were becoming a regular occurrence.
</P>
<P>
	   The risks of buying on margin increase in tandem with the volatility of the
markets, said NASD Regulation, the self-policing arm of the National Association
of Securities Dealers.

<HEADLINE> Heating Oil Up Again; Palladium Off  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Soaring heating oil prices climbed still higher Wednesday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, supported by fast-rising consumption on the frigid East
Coast and new evidence of shrinking inventories.
</P>
<P>
	   In other markets, wheat futures fell due to approaching storms in the Plains
states and platinum and palladium tumbled as investors braced for Russia's
return to the market as soon as next week.
</P>
<P>
	   Heating oil rose 2 percent, approaching last Friday's nine-year high in an
emotional market still dominated by world oil powers' discipline on lowered
production as well as the Northeastern cold snap.
</P>
<P>
	   The contract for February delivery rose 1.75 cent to 92.13 cents a gallon
after hitting 96 cents -- 2 1/2 cents above last Friday's high.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the market reversed course after officials of Saudi Arabia and
Norway suggested they think the world oil glut has been erased. That led to
speculation that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries might not be
certain, after all, about extending its oil cut agreement from March through
September.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, inventory data confirmed a large decline in heating oil
stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Department of Energy said stocks of distillate, which include
heating oil and diesel fuel, fell 8.2 million barrels in the week ended Friday.
The American Petroleum Institute reported similar figures on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Crude oil stockpiles fell 2.4 million barrels, the Department of Energy
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Crude prices wound up declining for the day, and heating oil gave up most of
its gains.
</P>
<P>
	   Energy analyst Phil Flynn said the market will be watching closely to see
what the oil ministers of Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Venezuela have to say in
upcoming meetings with U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson.
</P>
<P>
	   "Those comments are going to make traders think twice," said Flynn, of
Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the market gets the impression that OPEC's not going to extend its cuts,
the explosive bull market that we've had recently definitely will be at an end,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   March intermediate crude fell 44 cents to $27.84 a barrel; February unleaded
gasoline fell 1.80 cent to 74.99 cents a gallon; February natural gas fell 9.3
cents to $2.523 per 1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
	   March Brent crude from the North Sea fell 41 cents to $26.13 a barrel on
London's International Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat sank on the Chicago Board of Trade on the prospects of a storm
providing more moisture for the central and southern Plains states, where the
bulk of the U.S. winter wheat crop is grown. Significant snowfall and freezing
rain were expected in the region overnight, which would boost crop chances, and
another storm system is behind it.
</P>
<P>
	   Corn also fell back in a retrenchment from recent gains.
</P>
<P>
	   March wheat fell 4 3/4 cents to $2.60 a bushel, while March corn fell 4 1/2
cents to $2.23 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors took profits in platinum and palladium on the New York Merc,
concerned that Russia may start delivering materials at the end of January.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia is the world's No. 2 producer of platinum behind South Africa and No.
1 in palladium. Both metals are used heavily in industry. A lack of Russian
shipments has tightened world supplies and driven prices up.
</P>
<P>
	   April platinum fell $9.40 to $432.50 and March palladium fell $7 to $472.

<HEADLINE> NBC Boasts Richest Viewers  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- ABC, CBS and NBC are running neck-and-neck in the battle
for viewers this season but NBC can claim a clear edge in two categories crucial
to the business of television.
</P>
<P>
	   The median household income of $51,400 among NBC viewers is the highest of
any broadcaster, according to a new study. NBC is also touting research that
shows it's the network of choice among regular Internet users.
</P>
<P>
	   UPN, whose hike in ratings this year has been fueled largely by professional
wrestling, has an audience with the lowest median income at $35,500, said a
report by TN Media, a New York advertising firm. ABC was at $48,200, Fox at
$44,800, CBS at $39,200 and the WB at $40,400.
</P>
<P>
	   Seven of the eight network shows with the richest audience are on NBC,
including "Frasier," "Friends" and "West Wing." The exception is Fox's "Ally
McBeal."
</P>
<P>
	   "From a sales perspective, NBC has always targeted the 18-to-49-year-old
upscale viewers," said Alan Wurtzel, NBC president of research and media
development. "They're hard to get and advertisers are expected to pay a premium
for them."
</P>
<P>
	   The strategy's downside is that wealthy, well-educated people are not
necessarily heavy TV viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research.
</P>
<P>
	   In the more mundane measurement of average prime-time television viewers
this season, ABC, CBS and NBC are separated by a mere 50,000 people for the
distinction of most popular network. ABC, the network of "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire," has the narrow lead.
</P>
<P>
	   For years, NBC has focused so intently a young demographic craved by
advertisers that its executives effectively ignore people over age 49.
</P>
<P>
	   While meeting with reporters recently, NBC West Coast president Scott Sassa
unveiled statistics showing NBC has a 15 percent ratings advantage over
second-place ABC among television viewers aged 18-49 who also have access to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   That's not unexpected, since NBC courts the young, wealthy people more
likely to own computers, Wurtzel said.
</P>
<P>
	   The most popular television programs among Internet users are "Law &AMP; Order"
and "West Wing."
</P>
<P>
	   The explosion of dot-com related television advertising explains NBC's
interest in pulling out this statistic for the first time. Internet-related
companies bought $132 million in TV advertising during all of 1998 and $277
million in just the first nine months of 1999 -- before the holiday season,
according to Competitive Media Reporting.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly $114 million of the 1999 advertising money went to NBC, compared to
$69 million for its closest competitor, ABC. CBS' and Fox's share of the dot-com
spending were each less than half of NBC's, CMR said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although those statistics may show NBC's appeal in this lucrative market
sector, it may not be something to brag about to other advertisers, one industry
expert said.
</P>
<P>
	   "That makes me wonder as an advertiser, 'Do I want to buy them?"' said Tom
DeCabia, executive vice president of the media buying firm Schulman Advanswers
NY. "Those computers aren't sitting in the corner. Somebody's using them instead
of watching TV."

<HEADLINE> Gene ID'd in Spinal Cord Injuries  </HEADLINE>
    By JEFF BARNARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Scientists have identified a gene that prevents the brain and spinal cord
from rewiring themselves after an injury, pointing the way to new treatments
that might someday help paralyzed "Superman" star Christopher Reeve and 250,000
Americans like him.
</P>
<P>
	   Dubbed "Nogo" because of its inhibiting effect, the gene produces a protein
that prevents nerve-cell connections in the central nervous system from
regenerating after they are cut. Experiments in rats showed that when the
protein is blocked, the spinal cord can repair itself.
</P>
<P>
	   Neurologists hailed the work as a landmark step. But they cautioned that
other factors may also inhibit nerve regrowth.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is important not to give patients false hope," said Dr. Ben Barres, a
professor of neurology at Stanford University. "But I think there are a lot of
grounds for optimism now."
</P>
<P>
	   The findings were reported in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature by
scientists in Switzerland, England and the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   If the scientists are right, they have solved an old mystery: Why can't
connections in the central nervous system -- the brain and spinal cord -- repair
themselves, when connections in the peripheral nervous system -- everything else
-- can?
</P>
<P>
	   The answer is that the Nogo protein is present in the central nervous system
but not in the other nerves. Nogo may exist to hardwire the brain and spinal
cord -- or fix them in place -- after they have developed, and prevent them from
going wild.
</P>
<P>
	   A team led by Martin Schwab of the Brain Research Institute at the
University of Zurich in Switzerland has been working on Nogo for 15 years, and
created an antibody that blocks the Nogo-created protein.
</P>
<P>
	   In test-tube experiments, nerves dissected from rats were exposed to the
antibody. The nerves regrew several hundred nerve connections known as axons, or
the tiny branches that transmit impulses from one nerve cell to the next, Schwab
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   In an additional set of experiments that were not published in Nature,
Schwab's team said it partially cut the spinal cords of rats, paralyzing the
animals, then gave the rodents the antibody for two weeks. The nerves regrew,
and the animals resumed normal activities such as grabbing food pellets and
climbing a rope.
</P>
<P>
	   "We see these animals' recovery functionally," said Isabel Klusman, a
medical biologist who works with Schwab.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers said the Nogo research may lead to a three-pronged therapy
involving a Nogo blocker, some agent to boost nerve growth, and some kind of
cell transplant.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwab's team never identified the actual gene. That was done by two
separate teams, one at the pharmaceutical company SmithKline Beecham in England,
the other led by Dr. Stephen Strittmatter at Yale University.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 11,000 people injure their spinal cords each year, primarily in car
wrecks, as football star Derrick Thomas did last Sunday. Reeve has been
paralyzed from the neck down, using a respirator to help him breathe, since a
1995 fall from a horse.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers are more cautious than Reeve, but the actor, whose foundation
helped finance some of the Nogo research at Yale, said the discoveries are part
of a growing body of advances that he believes will allow him to walk again
someday.
</P>
<P>
	   Reeve said he hopes to take part in human tests by Schwab in about five
years, once work has progressed to the point he would feel safe.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will be a question of money and time," Reeve said from his office in
Bedford, N.Y. "But the field now is very alive and there is suddenly a lot of
progress being made."

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Offer Health Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By JANELLE CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced a plan
Wednesday to offer tax credits for low-income families to purchase health
insurance -- giving momentum to the push for coverage of the nation's 44 million
uninsured.
</P>
<P>
	   The congressional proposal, estimated at about $70 billion over 10 years,
comes just days after President Clinton unveiled his own $110 billion health
insurance package.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This effort marks the first major bipartisan, bicameral, market-based
initiative on behalf of the uninsured since 1994,'' said Sen. Jim Jeffords,
R-Vt. ``We believe the issue of access to health coverage for the uninsured must
be a top national priority.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why should the waitress or that person who works on your lawn ... have
less access to health care in America than the high paid executive,'' said House
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas. ``That is not acceptable. It must be
corrected. I think we've got the right formula.''
</P>
<P>
	   The lawmakers' plan would create a $1,000 tax credit for single coverage and
a $2,000 tax credit for family coverage. At least 27 million Americans who are
not offered an employer contribution plan or are not eligible for public
programs would be covered, lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. John Breaux, D-La., said it was unfair that ``low-income Americans get
no help buying their own health insurance while the federal government spends
$76 billion a year to subsidize employers who provide health coverage to their
workers, most of whom are middle and high-income.''
</P>
<P>
	   Legislation aimed at improving health care access for low-income Americans
was included in a $792 billion Republican tax-cutting plan vetoed by President
Clinton last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's plan, which will be included in Thursday's State of the Union
address, is a $110 billion package of health insurance initiatives.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's tax credit plan would provide a $3,000 long-term care tax
credit, costing $28 billion over 10 years. Another $76 billion in Clinton's plan
would be used to insure 4 million parents of children who receive health
coverage under Medicaid and the state Children's Health Insurance Program
(CHIP).
</P>
<P>
	   About 5 million Americans would be covered under the White House plan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Health Insurance Association of America, which has launched a widely
seen advertising campaign featuring the characters ``Harry and Louise'' to
promote its own proposal, said in a statement: ``We are pleased to see key
leaders in Congress are placing the same emphasis on this enormous and growing
problem.''
</P>
<P>
	   Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform cited as favorable a provision
in the congressional plan that would allow families to pick the health coverage
of their choice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``ATR supports your efforts to find a free-market solution to an issue like
health care,'' Norquist wrote in a letter to Armey.
</P>
<P>
	   Norquist complained that Clinton's plan, in contrast, would ``increase
spending, require tax increases while doing little to reform Medicare.''

<HEADLINE> NCAA Reduces Purdue's Penalties  </HEADLINE>
    By HANK LOWENKRON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Purdue will pay about $80,000 in penalties rather than
$800,000 for violating rules on recruiting, extra benefits and ethical conduct
in its men's basketball program, the NCAA ruled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The NCAA's decision leaves unsettled the fate of former assistant Frank
Kendrick and Purdue's 1995-96 Big Ten championship. Purdue officials said
Wednesday it's too early to tell what will happen in either case.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's been a long haul. A lot of different people have been involved,"
Purdue athletic director Morgan Burke said. "My feeling is not one of relief.
... It's probably going to be something that I'm going to need to get out from
underneath for a while, to reflect on the whole thing."
</P>
<P>
	   Purdue had challenged the NCAA's committee on infractions, which said in
June that Kendrick arranged the contacts leading to a a $4,000 bank loan made to
Purdue player Luther Clay in August 1995. The committee also said Kendrick
arranged contacts for financial assistance provided by Indianapolis businessman
Gene McFadden to the mother of former Purdue player Porter Roberts.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeals committee on Wednesday vacated one finding against Kendrick,
saying evidence the assistant arranged for the mother of a prospect to move to
Indianapolis wasn't reliable. Kendrick has been reassigned to another university
position.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee also reduced the financial penalty from $800,000 to $80,000.
</P>
<P>
	   NCAA spokeswoman Jane Jankowski said Purdue originally was fined 90 percent
of all money going to the Big Ten from the 1996 NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
	   She said the appeals committee ruled that the school should instead return
90 percent of its share after dividing the payments with other Big Ten
universities.
</P>
<P>
	   Payouts from the tournament are disbursed over a six-year period.
</P>
<P>
	   Purdue also will forfeit 24 games it won while Clay was on the team during
the 1995-96 season when the Boilermakers won the Big Ten championship and
finished 26-6.
</P>
<P>
	   Burke said the Big Ten's compliance committee will have the final say on
whether Purdue's championship will be affected by the forfeits. He said Big Ten
commissioner Jim DeLaney told him the committee would look at a number of
factors, including if there was a finding of institutional control, the way the
case was handled by the institution, the penalties imposed and the contributions
of the player.
</P>
<P>
	   Kendrick, a former Purdue basketball star, had been an assistant to Keady
since 1990. He resigned last June when Purdue filed its appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   "Frank has been a very loyal, dedicated Purdue guy. As he goes forward now,
certainly we can't bring him back on to the bench," Burke said. "He'll have to
sort out what's best for him."
</P>
<P>
	   Burke said that since it is the middle of the school year and Kendrick has
children in school, "doing any kind of separation right now doesn't seem right
to us."
</P>
<P>
	   He said the athletic department has offered to continue funding his position
for the balance of the school year and that "everybody will need a little time
to sort through and decide what the next steps are."
</P>
<P>
	   Burke said he hopes the university can now move on even though he disagrees
with some of the decisions.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I get up in the morning, I feel like I did the right thing. I did what
the university pays me to do, and that is to try and manage these things to the
best of my ability," he said.

<HEADLINE> Dorsett Tries To Match Dad's Ring  </HEADLINE>
    By TERESA M. WALKER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- He looks a lot like his dad, built like him, too.
</P>
<P>
	   The son is 5-11, 200 pounds. The father was 5-11, 190 when he played in his
first Super Bowl with the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
	   Anthony Dorsett will play in his first Super Bowl on Sunday, trying to win
the same kind of championship ring Tony Dorsett has worn since 1978.
</P>
<P>
	   But unlike his Hall of Fame father, the younger Dorsett isn't one of the
biggest names on the field. He's one of the Tennessee Titans' special teamers,
and he'll start against the St. Louis Rams only because free safety Marcus
Robertson broke his leg during last week's AFC championship game.
</P>
<P>
	   But by getting the starting job, Anthony has put the Dorsetts in the NFL
record book: They're the first father and son to do so in a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think someone needs to give us a commercial or something," said the
26-year-old defensive back, who deliberately uses Anthony -- without the Junior
-- to establish his own identity.
</P>
<P>
	   His proud father said he was "delighted as can be."
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think anyone in America could be happier than I am," said Tony
Dorsett, who will be in the Georgia Dome come gametime, cheering for his son.
</P>
<P>
	   So, has Dad been calling with advice?
</P>
<P>
	   "He's trying to make sure I keep focused and keep my head in the game with
all this media frenzy and people calling for tickets," he said. "I'm doing what
he says to keep my head on a level plane and just roll with the punches."
</P>
<P>
	   Robertson's been talking to him, too.
</P>
<P>
	   "He knows it's going to be difficult, but his attitude is that he's going to
go out there and have fun," Robertson said. "I keep talking to him about playing
what he sees."
</P>
<P>
	   Dorsett's football genes were noticeable from the outset.
</P>
<P>
	   The first time he touched the ball in a Pop Warner game in Pittsburgh, he
returned a kickoff 75 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
	   "Immediately when I started playing ball, everyone was commenting on how we
were doing things the same," the son said. "And everyone always remarked on how
big our eyes get."
</P>
<P>
	   He moved to Dallas as a teen-ager to spend more time with his father during
the late 1980s. Being in the limelight as Tony's son didn't bother him, but he
tried to limit comparisons to his dad by switching from running back to wide
receiver and cornerback in high school.
</P>
<P>
	   Recruiters, however, didn't beat down his door, so he chose Pittsburgh for
sentimental reasons -- Tony helped the Panthers win the 1976 national
championship.
</P>
<P>
	   "Also it was kind of like going home. It wasn't too far from my
grandparents, aunts and uncles if anything ever went wrong," Dorsett said.
</P>
<P>
	   While his father set rushing records, won the Heisman Trophy in 1976 and was
the top NFL draft pick the following year, Anthony's Pitt career wasn't quite so
stellar with 80 tackles in four years. Actually, he made much more of a mark as
the Big East outdoor champion in the 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the Dorsett name didn't hurt when the Houston Oilers wanted a
cornerback for their secondary in 1996. The Oilers drafted him in the sixth
round with the 177th pick and offered him Tony's number 33.
</P>
<P>
	   Anthony showed off the Dorsett touch in his first NFL game, returning a
kickoff 99 yards for a touchdown in an exhibition with the New York Jets. His
father holds the NFL record for the longest run from scrimmage, a 99-yarder in
1983 against the Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
	   But that's not the play Anthony remembers best. His favorite is a 10-yard TD
run where Tony faked out three Arizona Cardinals who collided as he ran in for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
	   "Growing up I never looked at my dad as the great football player that he
was," Anthony said. "He was just my dad. I wasn't involved in all the things on
the field. It took me to get where I am today to appreciate what he did in
football."

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Co-Chair To Retire  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Robert Eaton, the former
Chrysler chairman and CEO who helped orchestrate one of the largest industrial
mergers ever with Daimler-Benz AG, will retire from the company March 31.
</P>
<P>
	   Eaton, 59, gave the announcement to a meeting of senior managers Wednesday,
saying that "this is the right time for me to go."
</P>
<P>
	   "This of course should be no surprise to anyone. I've said from the very
beginning that when this merger is complete, I would be retiring. The time is
now."
</P>
<P>
	   When Chrysler was acquired by Daimler-Benz AG in 1998, Eaton said he would
share the job of chairman with Daimler-Benz head Juergen Schrempp for no more
than three years, then retire. Eaton had said he would retire earlier if the
major hurdles of the merger were completed.
</P>
<P>
	   While the marriage was originally billed as a merger of equals -- with
headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany and Auburn Hills, Mich. -- DaimlerChrysler
has become a German-American company with the emphasis on German. Most of its
stock is held in Germany; the company is incorporated under German business
laws, and a majority of its upper managers come from the Daimler-Benz side.
</P>
<P>
	   And while the two firms found billions in savings through the merger, the
former Chrysler and Daimler-Benz divisions run their businesses with little
interference from across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
	   Eaton, a mechanical engineer, joined Chrysler in 1992 after a 29-year career
at General Motors Corp. Eaton had worked in a variety of jobs at GM, including
running GM's European operations, before joining Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
	   Eaton was promoted to chairman and chief executive officer on Jan. 1, 1993,
replacing Lee Iacocca. During his tenure, Chrysler reworked itself from the
weakest of the Big Three automakers into a highly profitable company.
</P>
<P>
	   But Eaton also came to believe that Chrysler could not face the future
alone, that only a handful of automakers could survive and compete globally.
</P>
<P>
	   "We recognized we weren't going to be able to grow as a single company
internationally as we felt was necessary. We felt it was a tremendous
opportunity for Chrysler," Eaton said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   He and Schrempp began talking about a possible combination at the 1998
Detroit auto show, and announced the $32.8 billion deal five months later.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are leading a new trend we believe will change the future, the face of
the industry," Eaton said when the deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
	   The two leaders acknowledged the merger wouldn't be easy. Their own study of
transnational mergers suggests that 70 percent failed to achieve the kind of
success that had been anticipated.
</P>
<P>
	   The resulting company -- named DaimlerChrysler after a long series of
negotiations -- not only makes cars, but commercial trucks, trains and rockets
as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the merger, several top Chrysler executives have left, including its
highly regarded president, Thomas Stallkamp, who had been mentioned as a
possible successor to Eaton.
</P>
<P>
	   DaimlerChrysler's stock price has slowly fallen from its post-merger highs,
when it was above $100 a share; shares of DaimlerChrysler were trading down 81
1/4 cents to $67.18 3/4 at 5:15 p.m. EST on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   And there have been concerns that the freewheeling spirit of Chrysler was a
poor fit with the regimental view of Daimler. Eaton worked hard to sell the
merger to employees and shareholders, and to ease concerns about culture
clashes.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think you'll ever end up with one culture," he said Wednesday. "We
want to have the culture of wherever we work around the world. I feel very good
about the synergies we've produced so far."
</P>
<P>
	   As recently as this year's Detroit auto show, Eaton said in an interview
there was "no new news to report" about his status with the company. Eaton said
Wednesday he decided last week to retire.
</P>
<P>
	   "This has just been a great year," Eaton said. "We have the structure in
place now, we have the leadership in place ... we've got an incredible
portfolio, and the pipeline is absolutely full of product."
</P>
<P>
	   When Eaton retires, Schrempp will become the sole chairman of
DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every achievement of this company in the future will bear a portion of
Bob's legacy of leadership and vision," Schrempp said in a statement. "Bob
Eaton's dedication and role in the transition made DaimlerChrysler possible, and
has been a key to its success."

<HEADLINE> Grandmothers Arrive for Elian Visit  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez and his grandmothers arrived for a long-awaited
reunion this afternoon at a ``neutral site'' arranged by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
	   The 6-year-old Cuban boy was driven to a nun's house in Miami Beach to see
his grandmothers, who had flown in from Washington and were brought to the home
in a helicopter.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers came to the United States last week to appeal directly to
the American people and Congress to send the boy back to his father in Cuba.
Elian's relatives in Miami want him to stay and are fighting a U.S. government
order sending him back.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers were to see Elian privately, with the boy's Florida
relatives nearby in the house. Justice Department spokeswoman Carole Florman
said the women would not be allowed to take the boy home with them afterward.
</P>
<P>
	   A few people tossed flowers at the car that took the women from the
helicopter to the house. Some demonstrators outside the home cheered and others
booed as the grandmothers were driven by.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers had also flown to Miami on Monday but left town without
seeing the boy. They said they were uncomfortable going to the house in Little
Havana where the relatives have been caring for the boy. Several emotional
anti-Castro protests have been held in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
	   Mariela Quintana and Raquel Rodriguez had not seen their grandson since
before he left Cuba for the United States with his mother, who died in the
attempt along with 10 other people. Elian was found clinging to an inner tube
off the Florida coast on Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
	   The reunion was being held at the home of Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin,
president of Barry University. O'Laughlin, 70, has a history of helping
immigrants and had said she would serve as ``welcomer'' and ``hugger.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Capitol Hill today, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott indicated he has no
solid plans for handling legislation next week to give Elian U.S. citizenship,
which would remove the boy from INS jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are a lot of extenuating circumstances,'' he said. ``Obviously it
could come up next week. But there are a lot of people looking at this issue and
there may be developments between now and then.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lott said he believes the appropriate way to determine the boy's future is
through court action, which citizenship would allow, but said he would listen to
senators who don't want the issue handled by Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   To take effect, the measure would have to pass both houses and be signed by
President Clinton, who has said he would not rule out a veto.
</P>
<P>
	   The two women made an impassioned appeal to Congress on Tuesday not to pass
such a bill, saying Elian was a Cuban citizen and belonged with his father and
them in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's our right to see our grandson and take him back home,'' said Mrs.
Quintana, the child's paternal grandmother.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque demanded during a visit to Moscow
today that the boy be returned, accusing the United States of violating his
human rights. Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov also has endorsed the idea of
returning the boy.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite no prospect of taking Elian with them, his grandmothers were still
looking forward to the visit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know if I'll cry or if I'll laugh,'' Mrs. Rodriguez, Elian's

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that moved substantially or traded heavily Wednesday
on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   Corning shares rose as the company raised an estimated $1.91 billion through
the sale of 13 million new common shares. The company said it would use the
money for acquisitions, to repay debt and for other corporate purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   EMC shares fell despite reporting fourth quarter earnings of 34 cents a
share, excluding a one-time charge related to an acquisition. The figure beat
Wall Street analysts' estimates of 31 cents a share. Still, the company reported
lower-than-expected revenues for an important segment of its business and
investors fled.
</P>
<P>
	   Merrill Lynch on Tuesday reported fourth quarter earnings more than double
those of a year ago and well above analysts' expectations. The company reported
profits of $764 million, or $1.80 a share, well above the $1.39 a share analysts
had predicted. A year ago, Merrill Lynch reported profits of $359 million, or 86
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Coca-Cola announced it plans to eliminate 20 percent of its work force, or
6,000 jobs, in an effort to cut costs and shift responsibility to local markets.
The job cuts will result in pretax charges of $800 million this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Qualcomm, which makes cellular phone technology, beat analysts' earnings
estimates by a penny, reporting earnings of 25 cents a share. But the company
warned that sales of cellular chips may be off this quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   EBay reported fourth-quarter earnings of 4 cents a share, excluding one-time
charges, beating the 2-cents a share estimate expected by Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
	   Covad, a provider of high-speed Internet access over ordinary copper
telephone lines, reported a fourth-quarter loss of 80 cents a share, beating the
94-cent average loss predicted by analysts.
</P>
<P>
	   CheckFree, an electronic commerce company, reported a loss of 8 cents a
share for its fiscal second quarter, compared with earnings of 22 cents a year
ago. Excluding one-time charges, the company broke even during the second
quarter of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Plans To Cut 6,000 Jobs  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN BACHMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Coca-Cola will shed more than a fifth of its work force,
eliminating 6,000 jobs in a reorganization aimed at reducing the powers of its
Atlanta headquarters and freeing managers around the world to make the best
decisions on how to sell more soda.
</P>
<P>
	   The job cuts announced Wednesday -- the largest in the 113-year-history of
the world's largest soft-drink maker -- will affect 2,500 positions at the
company's Atlanta headquarters, 800 elsewhere in the United States and 2,700
outside the country.
</P>
<P>
	   "The world in which we operate has changed dramatically, and we must change
to succeed," said Coke's new president, Doug Daft, who already has moved quickly
to reshape the ranks of management before he assumes the job of chairman and
chief executive in April.
</P>
<P>
	   "We must think local and act local, taking our business to where our
business is. This will allow us to sell more products," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The job cuts, which are expected to be completed in March, represent about
21 percent of the company's 29,000-person global work force and 40 percent of
the 6,200 jobs in Atlanta. Most of the cuts are in back-office functions, rather
than in producing and marketing soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, employee compensation and benefits work will be contracted out,
as will plant and office maintenance.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody's walking around stunned," said Kevin Hundley, a computer
programmer in Atlantawho has worked for Coke for 18 months. "Everybody's finding
out today, but I think it's something they need to do."
</P>
<P>
	   The company is struggling to improve profits after enduring a string of
setbacks during the last 18 months, including a severe economic downturn in
Asian markets, a costly product recall in Europe and a discrimination lawsuit
filed by a group of minority employees in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   Coke estimated that the job cuts will save $300 million a year but said
earnings would be reduced by $800 million before taxes this year to the cover
costs of the realignment. Displaced workers will be offered severance packages,
outplacement and counseling, Coke said.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement came as Coca-Cola separately reported fourth-quarter
earnings that slightly exceeded Wall Street expectations. But Coke shares fell
more than 4 percent on expectations that short-term profits would be squeezed as
the company reduced shipments of soft-drink concentrate to bottlers to better
manage inventories, said Caroline Levy, an analyst with Schroder and Co.
</P>
<P>
	   Coca-Cola fell $2.81 1/4 to $63.06 1/4 a share as of 5:15 p.m. EST on the
New York Stock Exchange, where almost 11.8 million shares changed hands, more
than twice the average daily volume for Coke.
</P>
<P>
	   Coca-Cola had a loss of $45 million, or 2 cents a share, in the last three
months of 1999, compared with a profit of $597 million, or 24 cents a share, in
the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   The fourth-quarter loss included 33 cents per share in one-time charges,
including writeoffs in Russia and the Baltic states. Excluding the extraordinary
factors, Coke earned 31 cents per share and that was a penny higher than the 30
cents a share that Wall Street expected.
</P>
<P>
	   Quarterly revenue rose 11 percent to $4.9 billion from $4.5 billion a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, Coke's earnings tumbled 31 percent to $2.43 billion, or 98
cents a share, from $3.53 billion, or $1.42 a share, in 1998. In addition to the
writeoffs, the decline reflected the lost sales and cost of European recalls
last year after a product contamination scare.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue rose to $19.8 billion from $18.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, Daft conceded that the European
recall showed that the company was not well-suited to react quickly and that
local officials were not autonomous enough.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a wake-up call for us," he said. "We looked at ourselves very
closely as a result of it, and obviously have made some changes in the way we
will do business. We will do business understanding the environment."
</P>
<P>
	   The size of the cuts surprised many analysts who had predicted Coke would
trim 2,000 to 4,000 jobs. Daft said the 6,000 figure was chosen after a
six-month review of the company's entire operation.
</P>
<P>
	   The job cuts are the latest in a series of management shuffles engineered by
Daft, who became president Dec. 5 when Chairman and CEO M. Douglas Ivester
stunned employees and analysts by announcing he would retire after Coke's annual
shareholders' meeting in April.
</P>
<P>
	   Doug Lane, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, said Daft's shift of
decision-making powers to local managers stemmed from the three decades he spent
with Coke's Asian operations.
</P>
<P>
	   "You've really got to go with management on this one," Lane said. "It's
obvious that he's very passionate about decentralizing responsibility. He is
emphatic that this is a local business, that you have to mix the global brands
with the local brands."

<HEADLINE> Democrats Help McCain in N.Y.  </HEADLINE>
   By JESSE J. HOLLAND Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- In an ironic twist, a couple of Democrats on Wednesday
kept Sen. John McCain from being thrown off the ballot for New York's Republican
presidential primary in about one-quarter of the state's 31 congressional
districts.
</P>
<P>
	   But lawyers working for New York supporters of Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
the GOP presidential front-runner, immediately filed a lawsuit in state court
appealing the outcome. A decision could come as early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The move to the courts came after the two Republican members of the state
Board of Elections voted to uphold the challenges to McCain's petitions for a
spot on the March 7 ballot. But the board's two Democrats abstained, thus
depriving the Bush camp of the third vote it needed to have the petitions
invalidated for a lack of signatures.
</P>
<P>
	   With recent polls showing McCain running ahead of Bush in New Hampshire,
which holds its first-in-the-nation primary next Tuesday, the battle over the
New York primary ballot has taken on extra significance.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, who finished second to Bush in
Monday's Iowa caucuses, have filed petitions to qualify for New York's primary
ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's camp lauded Wednesday's development.
</P>
<P>
	   Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari, head of McCain's New York
campaign, said the move ``defends the rights of New York voters to support the
candidate of their choice ... The Bush challenges in New York have made our
party a national disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain lawyer Henry Berger, a New Yorker who normally represents Democratic
candidates, said the controversy shows why New York needs to change its election
laws.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It has become not a matter of democracy, but a blood sport,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain turned to Berger after learning that state GOP Chairman William
Powers, a Bush backer who is directing the petition challenges, had locked up
the services of most Republican lawyers who are expert in the intricacies of the
state's complex election laws.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, GOP candidates must get a certain number of signatures from
party members to qualify separate convention delegate slates in each of the
state's congressional districts where they want to compete.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's New York backers, who include Gov. George Pataki, challenged McCain's
petitions in 16 of New York's congressional districts. Local election officials
in New York City and on Long Island earlier had ruled McCain off the ballot in
four of those 16 districts. Berger said he would try to get McCain reinstated in
at least two of the four.
</P>
<P>
	   Less than an hour after the state board's move Wednesday, lawyer Jeffrey
Buley, who works for the Bush supporters, was in state Supreme court calling the
board's failure to invalidate the petitions ``capricious'' and ``arbitrary.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was clearly evident that the petitions were lacking the prerequisite
number of signatures,'' Buley, a Powers confidant, said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who had tried to qualify for the ballot in 30 of the state's 31
congressional districts, also has filed a federal court lawsuit seeking to open
up the New York ballot. The case will be heard in Brooklyn on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Strong Yen Pushes Sony Profits Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Sony Corp.'s earnings fell 16.6 percent in its third fiscal
quarter as the world's biggest audio and video equipment maker said the yen's
strength reduced its results from overseas.
</P>
<P>
	   While its electronics sales rose, revenue from it video-game, movie and
music divisions were lower in the three months ended Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   The maker of the PlayStation home video game console reported Wednesday a
group net profit of 93.63 billion yen, or $918 million, for the last three
months of 1999, down from 112.32 billion yen in the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales fell 1.8 percent to 1.92 trillion yen, or $18.78 billion, from 1.95
trillion yen a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   The yen averaged 103.6 yen to the U.S. dollar in the October-December
quarter, 30.1 percent higher than a year earlier. Against the euro, the Japanese
currency averaged 107.2 yen, 14.7 percent higher than in the third quarter of
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The strong yen hurts Japanese exporters like Sony because it lowers the
value of their overseas earnings when translated into yen, and makes their
products more costly in foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales of personal computers, video cameras and other electronics goods,
Sony's biggest segment, remained strong both in Japan and the United States.
Electronics sales rose 2.3 percent to 1.31 trillion yen, or $12.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   But the currency's strength was blamed for depressing revenue from the other
three main businesses at Sony: video games, music and motion pictures.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales for Sony's movie business decreased 5.8 percent to 129 billion yen, or
$1.27 billion, for the quarter despite the December release of "Stuart Little"
and earnings from the TV debut of "Men in Black" and the home video release of
"Big Daddy."
</P>
<P>
	   Sony's music business, which owns the rights to songs by Celine Dion and
Maria Carey, among others, reported a sales drop of 9.2 percent to 214 billion
yen, or $2.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Lower sales of game machines helped send sales in Sony's video-game business
down 23.5 percent to 240 billion yen, or $2.36 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Sony earned 158.6 billion yen,
or $1.56 billion, down 20.1 percent from 198.4 billion yen a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue fell 5.5 percent to 5.031 trillion yen, or $49.3 billion, from 5.322
trillion yen a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Sony shares rose $6 to $245.25 in trading at 5:15 p.m. on the New York Stock
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Speech Guests  </HEADLINE>
   By NANCY ZUCKERBROD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A 72-year-old woman who spends $4,000 from her savings
for prescription drugs each year will be among President Clinton's guests at
Thursday's State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton is expected to refer to Pat Brown of Johnson City, Tenn., when he
discusses a proposal to add a prescription drug plan to Medicare, the federal
health insurance program for the elderly and disabled. Brown will be seated with
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm going to be there to represent all of the many older people in this
country who are being hurt financially by the cost of prescription drugs,''
Brown said in a telephone interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm looking forward to meeting the president and being a representative
for this initiative.''
</P>
<P>
	   Brown, who needs medication for heart and thyroid ailments, said she used to
get her prescriptions paid through Medigap, supplemental insurance that covers
drugs and some services not provided through Medicare. That ended when the
premiums became higher than the cost of the medication, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now I have to take money out of my savings to pay for prescription
drugs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown, who has three grown children and seven grandchildren, retired five
years ago as director of the Area Agency on Aging in northeastern Tennessee. The
agency, which receives state and federal funding, helps seniors get social
services that allow them to continue living on their own.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she encountered many people who were without drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've heard stories of people deciding whether to pay their telephone bill
or buy drugs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans in Congress say they would like to add a prescription drug plan
to Medicare but want it to be accompanied by cost-cutting reforms to the
insurance program.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nobody is questioning the importance of drug coverage,'' said Sen. Bill
Frist, R-Tenn., a heart-lung surgeon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I firmly believe that structural reform must accompany any new program
added to Medicare, otherwise we risk accelerating the deteriorating financial
status of Medicare,'' said Frist, who will help deliver the official GOP
response to Clinton's speech.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House on Wednesday released the names of two other guests who will
be sitting with Mrs. Clinton during the speech:
</P>
<P>
	   --Dr. Francis S. Collins, who oversees the federal government's project to
map and sequence all human DNA by 2003.
</P>
<P>
	   --Carlos Rosas of St. Paul, Minn., who was having trouble paying child
support but now is keeping up with his obligation after enrolling in an
employment and training program.

<HEADLINE> Ark. Air Crash Transcript Released  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID A. LIEB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LITTLE ROCK (AP) -- The co-pilot of an American Airlines jet that crashed
while trying to land in a storm last June said Wednesday that he knew the plane
off course and had urged the captain to abort the landing.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the captain attempted to straighten the plane as it was buffeted by
high winds. The plane touched down off-center, breaking apart and killing 11
people, First Officer Michael Origel testified during a National Transportation
Safety Board hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Capt. Richard Buschmann was among those killed June 1 when the
McDonnell-Douglas MD-82 jet, traveling from Dallas to Little Rock, crashed.
</P>
<P>
	   The NTSB is holding a three-day hearing to try to determine what roles the
weather and the pilots' decisions played in the crash. The board also is looking
at how the plane performed and the failure of ground crews to quickly locate the
burning jet while its passengers were pelted by hail.
</P>
<P>
	   Origel is on medical leave and has not flown since the crash, American
Airlines spokesman John Hotard said.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking publicly for the first time, Origel said Wednesday that repeated
warnings of high winds near the airport did not match what he saw from the
cockpit. Until moments before touchdown, Origel said, he was confident the plane
would have no problem landing.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane was nearing the ground when one of the pilots exclaimed, ``We're
off course,'' according to a transcript of the cockpit voice recorder released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Four seconds later, the transcript quotes Origel saying, ``We're way off.''
</P>
<P>
	   Origel testified that he told Buschmann, ``Go around,'' indicating he wanted
the pilot to abort the landing.
</P>
<P>
	   However, an NTSB source close to the investigation said experts reviewed the
cockpit recording dozens of times, listening specifically for the statement, and
heard nothing, the source said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I clearly remember I did make a `Go around' statement. I remember that
very clearly,'' Origel told the board Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the hearing, the NTSB refused Origel's request to insert the words
into the transcript.
</P>
<P>
	   Origel also wanted the NTSB to note that a squeaking sound heard when the
plane touched down was similar to the sound made by spoilers, which are panels
used to slow the plane after it lands and in most cases are set to pop up when
the wheels hit the runway.
</P>
<P>
	   But NTSB lead investigator Greg Feith said the spoilers did not deploy.
</P>
<P>
	   Origel told the board that he believed Buschmann had set the spoilers but
that he couldn't remember whether the spoilers' lever was in the correct
position. Setting the spoilers was one of Origel's duties before the landing,
and it was unclear on the recording if he did so.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point after the landing, Origel said he thought the captain would
take off again, but then he saw the end of the runway approaching.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All of the sudden, I felt the impact from my left side. I put my hands up.
All I remember is this explosion of glass and debris from the left side,''
Origel said.
</P>
<P>
	   Buschmann was sitting to Origel's left in the cockpit.

<HEADLINE> Parties Urge Caution on Surplus  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Congressional Budget Office's forecast that lawmakers
could have an enormous $1.9 trillion federal surplus to dispense over the next
decade has triggered a similar response from Republicans and Democrats: Caution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't see the U.S. Senate rushing now to say, 'The candy store is open,
let's dive in and spend everything in sight,''' Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said
Wednesday at a Senate Budget Committee hearing. ``We're going to have to make
hard choices.''
</P>
<P>
	   A day after Congress' official budget scorekeeper practically doubled the $1
trillion estimate of excess tax dollars that it made only last July, most
lawmakers declined to demand correspondingly bigger tax cuts or spending
increases.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, many began this election year by emphasizing the need to use the
money to reduce the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the most important thing really does involve the budget, keeping a
balanced budget, not dipping into Social Security, and continuing to reduce the
national debt,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While I support both tax cuts that are targeted and a (Medicare)
prescription drug benefit, I think we should make it a priority to reduce the
national debt,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, ranking Democrat on
the Senate Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   To be sure, both parties are readying rival agendas of tax cuts and spending
increases that they will push in Congress and the presidential campaign trail,
partly to draw political contrasts for the voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Already, congressional Republicans have proposed three tax cuts and talked
about boosting spending for defense and education, while Democrats want spending
for most programs to rise annually to at least keep pace with inflation. In an
election year, it is almost certain some of those proposals will become law.
</P>
<P>
	   But with polls showing that people consider debt reduction a top priority --
and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan saying it is the best use for budget
surpluses -- many lawmakers see trimming the $5.7 trillion national debt as the
safest path politically this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Underlining that, President Clinton has said he will propose eliminating the
$3.7 trillion in publicly held debt by 2013, while House Republicans want to
erase it no later than 2015. The publicly held debt is owed by people and
institutions who hold government bonds, while the remaining $2 trillion in debt
is money in the Social Security and other trust funds that the government, in
effect, owes itself.
</P>
<P>
	   Another attraction debt reduction holds for lawmakers is that it is what
automatically happens to budget surpluses that are not used for tax cuts or
higher spending. With Clinton and Congress likely to block each other's highest
profile tax and spending proposals this year, lawmakers who support debt
reduction will be able to declare victory if a deadlock occurs this fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking ahead to that gridlock -- and linking it to their hopes for a
Republican president next year -- Republicans are talking about limiting their
tax cut effort this year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whether we do it this year or reserve it for another year, it is
inconceivable to me the American taxpayer doesn't deserve some of this money,''
said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporting debt reduction can also be a way for each party to try blocking
the other side's budget plans by accusing them of trying to use the money for a
less worthy cause.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think a lot of this talk, a newfound desire to pay down the debt, is
just a way of covering up the opportunities and denying opportunities for tax
relief at the same time,'' Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn., said of Democratic calls for
debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   Of course, ever-growing surplus projections could make it easier for the two
sides to achieve some of their budget goals while still saving the bulk of the
surplus for debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, some Democrats could back tax-cutting efforts led by
Republicans, such as reducing the additional taxes many couples must pay because
they are married.
</P>
<P>
	   And many Republicans are ready to join Democratic calls for higher spending.
House GOP leaders plan to announce Thursday that they will produce their own
version of President Clinton's proposal to provide prescription drug coverage
for senior citizens.

<HEADLINE> McCain Gets Personal on Abortion  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Sen. John McCain said Wednesday it would be a
``family decision'' to make if his teen-age daughter were contemplating an
abortion, a political question posed in such personal terms that the GOP
presidential hopeful and his wife expressed concern about the impact on their
child.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain first said that the ``final decision'' on ending a pregnancy would be
made by his daughter, 15. An hour later, he contacted reporters with a
clarification: ``I misspoke,'' he said. ``The family decision will be made by
the family, not by'' his daughter alone, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Later yet, he said, ``It's a family decision, not her decision and that's
pro-life,'' he said. ``Cindy (his wife) and I will make that decision.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain grew testy when reporters continued to press him during the day.
``What's the matter with you, sir,'' he said at one point. ``I've answered your
question, sir.''
</P>
<P>
	   He declined to answer when asked what would happen if his daughter became
pregnant as the result of rape or incest.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a 15-year-old daughter,'' Cindy McCain said when the question was
asked.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said his wife, who was traveling on his campaign bus at the time,
would call their daughter at school in Arizona to talk to her about why her name
might be in the news. ``I do worry, understandably, about my 15-year-old
daughter. I hope this won't have an impact on her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The abortion issue has flared in recent days, as the GOP presidential field
moves through the opening round of primaries and caucuses. Front-runner George
W. Bush, pressed repeatedly last week, said the Supreme Court's 1973 ruling
usurped rights properly belonging to the states, and the individual legislatures
should be able to decide what restrictions, if any, to place on abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservatives Steve Forbes, Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes are firmly opposed to
abortion, and favor overturning the court's decision.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My daughter has been raised to believe that that's God's decision, and
that it's already been made,'' Keyes said Wednesday. ``And, therefore, I have no
fear of what she would do.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and McCain, while both expressing opposition to abortion, have adopted
more nuanced positions, apparently in hopes of broadening their political
appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has adopted a highly unusual campaign style, spending long hours on a
charted bus in New Hampshire in close proximity to reporters, often bantering
good-naturedly and rarely refusing to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
	   A reporter aboard his ``Straight Talk Express'' campaign bus first posed the
question: If his 15-year-old daughter became pregnant and believed that she
wasn't ready to bear a child, would McCain block her from getting an abortion?
</P>
<P>
	   ``No,'' the Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue dogged McCain throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked whether his comments amounted to an abortion rights viewpoint, McCain
said: ``I don't think it's the choice position to say that my daughter and my
wife and I will discuss something that is a family matter and that we have to
decide.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pressed on the matter, McCain, clearly irritated, shot back: ``I'm not gonna
talk about what I'm gonna do with my daughter in the most personal and painful
kind of situation that I can imagine outside of a terminal illness.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator has said that he believes that life begins at conception
and that he opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest and when the
mother's life is in danger. He pointed out that he has consistently voted
against abortion during his 17-year congressional career. McCain also supports
parental notification, a law on the books in Arizona where his family lives.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has stumbled over the abortion issue before.
</P>
<P>
	   In August, he surprised his staff and angered anti-abortion allies by
appearing to suggest that he would oppose repealing Roe vs. Wade, the 1973
Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   Under pressure, McCain tried to clarify his views with written statements
saying he favors working to overturn the ruling while trying to reduce abortions
through adoptions, counseling and other efforts. Whenever McCain is asked about
the issue at town hall meetings, he says he wants to reduce the polarizing
nature of the debate by encouraging both sides to work together on issues to
which they agree, such as improving adoption and foster care systems.

<HEADLINE> Ark. Air Crash Transcript Released  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID A. LIEB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LITTLE ROCK (AP) -- The co-pilot of an American Airlines jet that crashed
while trying to land in a storm last June said Wednesday that he knew the plane
was off course and had urged the captain to abort the landing.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the captain attempted to straighten the plane as it was buffeted by
high winds. The plane touched down off-center, breaking apart and killing 11
people, First Officer Michael Origel testified during a National Transportation
Safety Board hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Capt. Richard Buschmann was among those killed June 1 when the
McDonnell-Douglas MD-82 jet, traveling from Dallas to Little Rock, crashed.
</P>
<P>
	   The NTSB is holding a three-day hearing to try to determine what roles the
weather and the pilots' decisions played in the crash. The board also is looking
at how the plane performed and the failure of ground crews to quickly locate the
burning jet while its passengers were pelted by hail.
</P>
<P>
	   Origel is on medical leave and has not flown since the crash, American
Airlines spokesman John Hotard said.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking publicly for the first time, Origel said Wednesday that repeated
warnings of high winds near the airport did not match what he saw from the
cockpit. Until moments before touchdown, Origel said, he was confident the plane
would have no problem landing.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane was nearing the ground when one of the pilots exclaimed, ``We're
off course,'' according to a transcript of the cockpit voice recorder released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Four seconds later, the transcript quotes Origel saying, ``We're way off.''
</P>
<P>
	   Origel testified that he told Buschmann, ``Go around,'' indicating he wanted
the pilot to abort the landing.
</P>
<P>
	   However, an NTSB source close to the investigation who spoke on condition of
anonymity said experts reviewed the cockpit recording dozens of times, listening
specifically for the statement, and heard nothing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I clearly remember I did make a `Go around' statement. I remember that
very clearly,'' Origel told the board Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the hearing, the NTSB refused Origel's request to insert the words
into the transcript.
</P>
<P>
	   Origel also wanted the NTSB to note that a squeaking sound heard when the
plane touched down was similar to the sound made by spoilers, which are panels
used to slow the plane after it lands and in most cases are set to pop up when
the wheels hit the runway.
</P>
<P>
	   But NTSB lead investigator Greg Feith said the spoilers did not deploy.
</P>
<P>
	   Origel told the board that he believed Buschmann had set the spoilers but
that he couldn't remember whether the spoilers' lever was in the correct
position. Setting the spoilers was one of Origel's duties before the landing,
and it was unclear on the recording if he did so.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point after the landing, Origel said he thought the captain would
take off again, but then he saw the end of the runway approaching.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All of the sudden, I felt the impact from my left side. I put my hands up.
All I remember is this explosion of glass and debris from the left side,''
Origel said.
</P>
<P>
	   Buschmann was sitting to Origel's left in the cockpit.

<HEADLINE> New N.H. Polls Give Gore the Edge  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore got an apparent bump in one New Hampshire poll
from his big win in Iowa's caucuses, while another state survey suggested George
W. Bush has lost ground among conservatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was locked in a close race with Bradley in New Hampshire in a Boston
Globe-WBZ-TV tracking poll right before the caucuses, but his improved showing
the night after the caucuses gave him a slight, 48 percent to 42 percent edge.
</P>
<P>
	   Numerous other polls taken right before the caucuses indicated Gore had an
edge over Bradley all along.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Republican side, a New Hampshire poll taken by RKM Research and
Communications for the Boston Herald and WCVB-TV has suggested that publisher
Steve Forbes and talk show host Alan Keyes have gained ground among
conservatives since December. That's apparently at Bush's expense, pollster R.
Kelly Myers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has slipped from 34 percent to 27 percent since December. Forbes had 16
percent in the latest poll, compared with 11 percent in December -- a change
just within the poll's 5 percentage point margin of error. Keyes was at 4
percent in December and is now at 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The traditional, conservative Republican voters originally lined up with
Bush,'' Myers said. ``In the last month, what we've seen is that both Forbes and
Keyes are eating into Bush's base of support, Forbes taking the fiscal
conservatives and Keyes taking the social conservatives.''
</P>
<P>
	   While the margins are small, Myers said he's seen a consistent movement
among these groups.
</P>
<P>
	   In the latest RKM poll, John McCain was at 32 percent -- about the level
he's been at since December; Bush was at 27 percent; Forbes at 16 percent; Keyes
at 8 percent; Bauer at 2 percent and Hatch, who withdrew from the race
Wednesday, at 0 percent. The gap between McCain and Bush was within the poll's
5-percentage-point error margin.
</P>
<P>
	   Among Democrats, Al Gore was at 46 percent and Bill Bradley was at 40
percent in the latest RKM poll. Two weeks ago, Bradley was ahead of Gore, 44-38.
Myers said it was impossible to tell how much of that shift came before the
caucuses or after.
</P>
<P>
	   The telephone poll for the Herald and WCVB was conducted Monday and Tuesday
after the Iowa caucuses, which Bush won on the Republican side and Gore won
among Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   A Boston Globe-WBZ poll taken Monday and Tuesday gave McCain 37 percent to
Bush's 35 percent, also a statistical tie. That poll, taken by KRC Research of
400 likely voters each in the Democrat and Republican primaries, also had an
error margin of plus or minus 5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   The Herald-WCVB poll found that one out of five likely voters in the
Democratic primary are concerned about Bradley's health. Bradley disclosed
earlier in the campaign that he had an irregular heartbeat, a condition for
which he takes medication. He said last week that he has had four recent
episodes, but insisted his health is not a concern.
</P>
<P>
	   Five percent of Democrats polled said they are ``very concerned'' that
Bradley's health could affect his ability to be president and 17 percent said
they are ``somewhat concerned.''

<HEADLINE> Grandmothers, Elian at Neutral Site  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez and his grandmothers arrived
Wednesday at a ``neutral site'' for a reunion that had to be arranged by the
U.S. government because of the personal and political passions swirling around
the 6-year-old Cuban boy.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was driven to a nun's house in Miami Beach to see his grandmothers,
who had flown in from Washington and were then brought to the home in a
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers came to the United States last week to appeal directly to
the American people and Congress to send the boy back to his father in Cuba.
Elian's relatives in Miami want him to stay and are fighting a U.S. government
order sending him back.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers were to see Elian privately, with the boy's Florida
relatives nearby in the house.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Department spokeswoman Carole Florman said the women would not be
allowed to take the boy home with them afterward. A lawyer for Elian's
relatives, Spencer Eig, said the visit was expected to last two hours.
</P>
<P>
	   A few people tossed flowers at the car that took the women from the
helicopter to the house. Some demonstrators outside the home cheered and others
booed as the grandmothers were driven by.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers had also flown to Miami on Monday but left town without
seeing Elian. They said they were uncomfortable going to the house in Miami's
Little Havana neighborhood where the relatives have been caring for the boy.
Anti-Castro Cuban immigrants have been holding protests around the home.
</P>
<P>
	   Mariela Quintana and Raquel Rodriguez had not seen their grandson since
before he left Cuba for the United States with his mother, who died along with
10 other people when their boat capsized. Elian was found clinging to an inner
tube off the Florida coast on Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
	   The reunion was being held at the home of Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin,
president of Barry University. O'Laughlin, 70, has a history of helping
immigrants and had said she would serve as ``welcomer'' and ``hugger.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott indicated he has no solid
plans for handling legislation next week to give Elian U.S. citizenship, which
would remove the boy from the jurisdiction of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, the agency that ordered him back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are a lot of extenuating circumstances,'' Lott said. ``Obviously it
could come up next week. But there are a lot of people looking at this issue and
there may be developments between now and then.''
</P>
<P>
	   To take effect, the measure would have to pass both houses and be signed by
President Clinton, who has not ruled out a veto.
</P>
<P>
	   The two grandmothers met with several members of Congress this week and
asked them not to pass such a bill.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's our right to see our grandson and take him back home,'' said Mrs.
Quintana, the child's paternal grandmother.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite no prospect of taking Elian with them, his grandmothers were still
looking forward to the visit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know if I'll cry or if I'll laugh,'' Mrs. Rodriguez, Elian's
maternal grandmother, told CNN on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Eig said Elian was ``a little bit afraid to go all by himself because he's
afraid they might be forced to take him back to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers have said Elian has told them by telephone that he wants to
return to Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Writer Disputes Auschwitz History  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A British writer disputed historically-accepted witness
accounts that thousands were poisoned to death at Auschwitz, saying Wednesday
that the crematoriums at the notorious Nazi concentration camp had no openings
to introduce gas.
</P>
<P>
	   David Irving, 62, is suing American academic Deborah Lipstadt in the High
Court over her 1994 book, ``Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth
and Memory,'' which he says maintains he denies the Holocaust and distorted
statistics.
</P>
<P>
	   Irving has outraged Jews and other Holocaust survivors by saying the
Holocaust has been exaggerated and by challenging the number and manner of
Jewish concentration camp deaths under Adolf Hitler's regime. He is the author
of several books on the academic fringe, including ``Hitler's War.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lipstadt, holder of the Dorot Chair in Modern Jewish and Holocaust Studies
at Emory University in Atlanta, and the publishers Penguin deny libel.
</P>
<P>
	   Under British law, a libel claimant only needs to prove that his reputation
has been damaged. Truth is not necessarily a defense.
</P>
<P>
	   Irving said researchers who photographed the collapsed roof of Auschwitz's
Crematorium Two -- destroyed by the Nazis as Russian troops approached -- found
no holes for inserting gas.
</P>
<P>
	   But Prof. Robert van Pelt, a historian who gave evidence for Lipstadt and
Penguin, cited ``massive amounts'' of witness accounts, photos and the drawings
of a sonderkommando, a Jewish inmate selected to work at the crematoria that
proved the camp was used for mass murder.
</P>
<P>
	   He referred to several photos, including one taken by an SS man in February,
1943 which showed openings on the new roof of Crematorium Two that he said fed
deadly Zyklon B pellets into the crematorium.
</P>
<P>
	   Irving has addressed neo-Nazi groups in Austria and Germany. In 1992, German
authorities fined him for claiming the historically-accepted accounts of German
gas chambers was British ``propaganda.'' He is banned from Germany, Canada and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
	   The case, which began on Jan. 11, is expected to last 12 weeks.

<HEADLINE> Cavs Forward Stack Activated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cavaliers backup forward Ryan Stack, sent home from the
team's recent West Coast road trip after nearly fainting on the bench before a
game in Portland, was activated by the team Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Stack was placed on the injured list on Jan. 16 because of dehydration and
an allergic reaction. He has missed eight games with the condition.
</P>
<P>
	   Stack became ill during the national anthem before the Cavs played the Trail
Blazers on Jan. 12. He returned home and underwent tests at the Cleveland
Clinic.
</P>
<P>
	   The 6-foot-11 Stack said he is taking medication for a thyroid problem and
could be ready to play soon. He is averaging 3.1 points and 2.6 rebounds per
game.
</P>
<P>
	   Stack fills the roster spot opened when forward Kornel David's second 10-day
contract expired.

<HEADLINE> Reports: Campo To Be Cowboys Coach  </HEADLINE>
    By JAIME ARON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Dave Campo was promoted from Dallas Cowboys' defensive
coordinator to head coach Wednesday, according to broadcast reports.
</P>
<P>
	   A news conference was scheduled for 6:30 p.m. EST. While the Cowboys made no
immediate announcement, the hiring was reported by ESPN, Fox and WBAP radio.
</P>
<P>
	   Campo, 42, has been with the team since Jones bought it in 1989. He was
among the group of assistant coaches Jimmy Johnson brought with him from the
University of Miami. He's been defensive coordinator since 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Campo is a low-profile guy taking on one of the highest-profile jobs in pro
sports. He's only the fifth coach the Cowboys have ever had -- and the first
three all won Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
	   But Dallas hasn't been a contender for championships lately. The Cowboys
have won only one playoff game since the last title in 1995 and they're 24-24
over the past three seasons with two first-round playoff losses.
</P>
<P>
	   Campo has one thing in common with the previous four Cowboys coaches: No NFL
head coaching experience.
</P>
<P>
	   Secondary coach Mike Zimmer is expected to replace Campo as defensive
coordinator. Campo spent six seasons overseeing the secondary before taking over
as coordinator.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones' 15-day search for a new coach hardly extended outside team
headquarters. The only other known candidates he interviewed were special teams
coach Joe Avezzano and offensive line coach Hudson Houck.
</P>
<P>
	   Campo and kicking coordinator Steve Hoffman are the only coaches remaining
from Johnson's initial staff.
</P>
<P>
	   Campo is the third member of the Class of '89 to become an NFL head coach,
joining Norv Turner and Dave Wannstedt. Butch Davis, who was defensive
coordinator after Wannstedt and before Campo, is the head coach at the
University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   That still leaves Dallas in need of an offensive coordinator. Chan Gailey
held both jobs before being fired Jan. 11, two days after the Cowboys were blown
out in the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   Gailey, whose two-year tenure was the shortest in team history, also was the
offensive coordinator -- and that's where the team struggled most. Campo's
defense allowed 13 points in four of its eight losses.

<HEADLINE> Torricelli rejects criticism over stock deals  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - New Jersey Sen. Robert Torricelli, who made a $215,000
paper profit in a type of investment he once said he would avoid, struck back at
his critics Wednesday and insisted that ethical politicians can be aggressive
investors.
<P>
	   He said he will continue to partake in high-risk investments including
initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
	   "I actually believe I'm a better United States senator because I understand
the economy, I participate, and I make some of these investments," Torricelli
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   His lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said Torricelli stays well within Senate rules and
ethical guidelines by relying on longtime investment advisors and avoiding deals
that grant him special treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   Torricelli, in his first term in the Senate, has become a leading fundraiser
and high-profile spokesman for the Democratic party. His aggressive brand of
politics is mirrored in the way he handles his personal finances.
</P>
<P>
	   Two recent deals raised questions about whether Torricelli gets special
opportunities because he is a senator - a notion he vigorously denies.
</P>
<P>
	   Torricelli last year was one of 15 people invited to buy shares of e.Volve
Technology Group Inc., a company involved in several Internet ventures. He spent
$5,000 for two shares.
</P>
<P>
	   When another Internet company, eVentures Group, bought e.Volve, Torricelli
ended up with 8,333 shares of eVentures stock. With eVentures trading on Nasdaq
Wednesday at about $26 a share, Torricelli's holdings were worth about $220,000
- although he cannot sell them until Sept. 21, 2001, by which time the stock
price could change.
</P>
<P>
	   Far from a sweetheart deal, Torricelli said his investment in e.Volve was a
huge risk.
</P>
<P>
	   "The company was near bankruptcy," he said. "They couldn't find anybody who
wanted to invest."
</P>
<P>
	   That view was seconded by Steven Loglisci, the chief executive of e.Volve,
who formerly was Torricelli's financial advisor. He said he turned to Torricelli
and other longtime friends for money to keep his project afloat.
</P>
<P>
	   "He did me a favor," Loglisci said. "At the time when Bob made his
investment, we were still testing the equipment. We didn't even know if it would
work."
</P>
<P>
	   In the second deal, Torricelli bought 18,750 shares of eDiets Co., which
sells diet plans on the Internet and plans to offer stock for public sale later
this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Torricelli said the eDiets opportunity was open to every client of Whale
Securities in New York, where Torricelli has had an account for seven years.
</P>
<P>
	   "To allege some special treatment is grossly unfair," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional watchdogs have been critical of Torricelli for the two deals.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Ruskin of the Congressional Accountability Project said Wednesday that
such deals "have the strong appearance of a gift when a member of Congress is
given a very generous private investment." Torricelli called that
characterization "completely irresponsible."
</P>
<P>
	   This is not the first time that Torricelli has raised eyebrows with his
personal finances.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1994, he made $144,000 after being invited to participate in an initial
public offering for the First Savings Bank of Perth Amboy.
</P>
<P>
	   He subsequently acknowledged "public debate and concern about the fairness"
of deals open only to a select number of investors. He placed his holdings in a
blind trust and said he would not personally invest in the market.
</P>
<P>
	   The blind trust, under the guidance of investment counselor and Democratic
contributor Matthew Gohd, carried on Torricelli's aggressive style. In one
initial public offering, the trust netted Torricelli a $52,446 profit in less
than 24 hours during his 1996 race for Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   That gain was widely publicized; Torricelli said the blind trust suffered
numerous large losses as well.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody writes about the profits," he said. "Nobody writes about the
losses."
</P>
<P>
	   Unhappy with its performance, Torricelli abandoned the blind trust in 1998
and resumed investing for himself. He said he regrets not announcing that
decision at the time: "It was a mistake for which I am profoundly sorry."
</P>
<P>
	   Torricelli, 48, spent 14 years in the House before joining the Senate in
1997. He said he is happy he chose government service over more lucrative
careers but has the right to try to build some wealth.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm at a point in my life where I can make these high-risk investments," he
said. "If they work, it's wonderful. If they don't, life goes on."

<HEADLINE> Belichick Drops Suit Against NFL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Bill Belichick dropped his antitrust lawsuit against
the NFL on Wednesday, a day after a judge refused to free him to negotiate to
coach other teams.
</P>
<P>
	   Belichick lost his attempt to gain a temporary restraining order against NFL
commissioner Paul Tagliabue's ruling that keeps him from coaching another team
without the New York Jets' permission.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge John Bissell ruled that Belichick could only blame
himself for his quandary after quitting the Jets.
</P>
<P>
	   "It made sense to withdraw the case and to assess our position," Belichick
lawyer David Feher said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Jets lawyers did not immediately return telephone messages.
</P>
<P>
	   The team has left Belichick in an unworkable position, Feher said.
</P>
<P>
	   "He cannot work in the NFL because the Jets have indicated they do not want
to employ him," he said. "He is not being paid, but he's still restricted from
pursuing his livelihood."
</P>
<P>
	   Belichick's $1.4 million contract, with three years left on it, called for
him to take over the team upon head coach Bill Parcells retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   Parcells quit Jan. 3 and Belichick stunned the team by resigning the next
day, citing uncertainties posed by the impending sale and potential problems
from Parcells' continued association with the front office.
</P>
<P>
	   Tagliabue's ruling covers only the 2000 season and does not address the
remaining two years on Belichick's contract.
</P>
<P>
	   Jets lawyer Glenn Kurtz said Thursday that Belichick asked last Friday if
the Jets were willing to let him return as head coach at the same salaries and
duties, but was turned down.

<HEADLINE> La. Dome To Host New Bowl Game  </HEADLINE>
    By BRETT MARTEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The Louisiana Superdome, already home to the Sugar Bowl,
would host an earlier bowl game matching the Sun Belt Conference champion
against an at-large team in 2001 under a plan unveiled Wednesday by the Greater
New Orleans Sports Foundation.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite grumblings that the 24 existing bowl games already too many, the
foundation is confident its application will be received well by the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
	   "The NCAA has given us the indication that conference champions need a bowl
game," foundation president Jay Cicero said.
</P>
<P>
	   NCAA spokesman Wally Renfro in Indianapolis said approval of new bowls
generally takes a year. He could not otherwise comment on the status of the
application.
</P>
<P>
	   Conference commissioner Wright Waters called the prospect of an automatic
bowl berth "a dream come true for our league."
</P>
<P>
	   "We've seen what happens to programs when they get an opportunity for
post-season play and we expect to see the same from our programs; we expect to
see them grow," Waters said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sun Belt Conference, founded as a basketball league in 1976-77, will for
the first time field seven football teams in 2001: Arkansas State, Idaho,
Louisiana-Lafayette, Louisiana-Monroe, Middle Tennessee State, New Mexico State
and North Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   The bowl game will be called the New Orleans Bowl until the foundation
agrees to a deal with a title sponsor, Cicero said, adding that TV negotiations
were under way with ESPN.
</P>
<P>
	   The game would be played during the third week in December -- before teams
arrive in New Orleans for the Sugar Bowl.

<TEXT>
<P>
    CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cleveland Cavaliers center Zydrunas Ilgauskas had two
screws inserted in his painful left foot Wednesday and, as first announced last
week, will miss the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
	   Drs. James Sferra and John Bergfeld inserted the screws and also did a
left-foot bone graft at the Cleveland Clinic.
</P>
<P>
	   Two months ago, the 7-foot-3 Ilgauskas decided against having the same
procedure. He hoped he could return to the Cavs after more rest and recuperation
but experienced pain after a workout last week.
</P>
<P>

season, broke the foot five games into last year's strike-shortened season.

<HEADLINE> Energy Acts To Ease Oil Price Surge  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department will delay deliveries to its
emergency oil reserve in hopes of easing the recent surge in fuel prices and
will closely monitor heating oil markets, Secretary Bill Richardson said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration has been under pressure to act as oil prices have edged
close to $30 a barrel from a low of less than $12 a barrel a year ago. Also,
heating oil and diesel fuel prices have risen rapidly.
</P>
<P>
	   The department will renegotiate contracts to postpone delivery on 5 million
barrels of oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in Louisiana and Texas, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Given today's market conditions, it simply makes sense,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
	   The action is intended to put more oil into the market and ease prices. But
many economists question whether it would have much impact. The United States
consumes about 18 million barrels of oil a day, according to the American
Petroleum Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   The move came a day after Richardson ruled out releasing oil already in the
emergency reserve to influence the oil markets, saying the reserve should be
used to deal with supply emergencies and should not be used to manipulate the
markets. No withdrawal from the reserve is planned, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The government is in the process of accepting 28 million barrels of oil as a
``royalty-in-kind'' payment from producers drilling on government land. About 10
million barrels have been delivered, but delivery of the next 5 million barrels
will be postponed, Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The companies have indicated a willingness to discuss putting additional
oil into the SPR (later) if we postpone delivery dates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Energy experts question whether a relatively small release of oil from the
reserve or diversion of deliveries greatly would affect prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Ebel, director of energy and natural security at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, said only a huge
release of oil would have a major effect.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think that's politically doable,'' Ebel said at a recent energy
conference.
</P>
<P>
	   The reserve holds about 580 million barrels, equivalent to 62 days of oil
imports.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said his department would more closely monitor the heating oil
markets to ``make certain that ... oil product suppliers can move heating oil to
those who need it most.''
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said he planned to meet next month in Boston with state officials
and industry representatives to examine why the rise in heating oil prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Wednesday, the president of the American Trucking Associations urged
President Clinton to withdraw oil from the government reserves to counter
soaring prices in diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
	   Walter McCormick, the ATA's president, said in a letter that diesel fuel,
which is made from the same distillate as heating oil, jumped 47 percent the
past year, including an 11-cent increase last week. Heating oil prices have
nearly doubled in some parts of the Northeast in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Richardson said the president would seek $154 million in the 2001
budget to help poor families make their homes more energy efficient. The
administration since 1997 had sought that amount each year, but Congress has
provided less each time, including $135 million this year.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, the White House announced it was making an additional $45
million available for low-income families to purchase heating oil. The money is
going to Northeast states and Alaska.

<HEADLINE> Republicans To Met for Final Debate  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the opening half of a debate doubleheader, the
Republican presidential candidates battled for position Wednesday night in their
last televised clash before the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
	   For George W. Bush, John McCain and the rest of the field, it was their
first debate since Iowa's caucuses on Monday night. Steve Forbes finished a
strong second behind Bush in Iowa, Alan Keyes was third and Gary Bauer was
fourth. McCain, who skipped Iowa, is at the top of the polls along with Bush in
New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   One fewer Republican contender was sharing the stage. Sen. Orrin Hatch of
Utah withdrew from the race earlier in the day and endorsed Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   The 90-minute debate was part of an unusual pair. The Democrats were taking
the same stage 30 minutes after the Republicans finished.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day, Bush focused on laying out his plan for using the budget
surplus to cut taxes, reduce the national debt and shore up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   Other candidates said the debate would be an important one, drawing more
interest with the primary less than a week away.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think people will be watching who perhaps weren't watching before
because of the proximity of the vote,'' said McCain. But he had had to spend
much of the day clarifying his anti-abortion stance.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, in the hours before the debate, was talking about the 30 percent he
won in the Iowa caucuses Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We started to get (a mandate) in Iowa. I hope we can get it going here,''
Forbes said while campaigning in Nashua.
</P>
<P>
	   Abortion, which played a substantial role in the Iowa caucuses, with the
strong impact of the Christian right, is less significant as a political factor
in New Hampshire. There are more independents than either registered Republicans
or Democrats here.
</P>
<P>
	   But the issue took center stage again earlier Wednesday when McCain, who
leads Bush in most New Hampshire polls this week, was asked by a reporter
whether he would stop his 15-year-old daughter from undergoing the procedure.
</P>
<P>
	   After first saying it would be her decision, McCain, whose home state has a
parental consent law for minors, clarified his position.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The family decision will be made by the family,'' he said, and not by his
daughter alone. McCain has repeatedly said he opposes abortion, believes that
life begins at conception and supports a requirement of parental consent.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue has shadowed the candidates throughout the campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Previously, Bush, who has faced frequent questions about the strength of his
anti-abortion convictions, was asked a slightly different question -- what he
would do if one of his relatives faced such a decision because of rape. ``It
would be up to her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes on Wednesday attacked McCain's comments as too weak. He said neither
the Arizona senator nor Bush could succeed as the GOP's presidential nominee
because neither man can articulate an acceptable position on the thorny issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They don't have it in their hearts, they don't have it in their minds.
They haven't thought it through,'' Keyes said in Manchester.

<HEADLINE> Ala. St. Athletic Director Resigns  </HEADLINE>
    By JENNA FRYER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- The football coach was fired, the players didn't
approve of the replacement, and on Wednesday the athletic director resigned.
</P>
<P>
	   If that wasn't enough, Joe Reed, a member of Alabama State's Board of
Trustees, called a press conference to discuss the school's crumbling athletic
department.
</P>
<P>
	   None of the other 11 board members were there, but about 20 boosters and
alumni turned out to hear Reed criticize the firing of Ron Dickerson, object to
the hiring of L.C. Cole and ridicule the school's attempt to become the first
historically black college to move up to Division I-A.
</P>
<P>
	   "The athletic department is in bad, bad shape," Reed said. "A state of flux
and it's a shame."
</P>
<P>
	   Donald Watkins, chair of the board's athletics committee, said Reed was
being vindictive and called him a "wrecking ball."
</P>
<P>
	   "He's been on a track to destroy the school ever since he lost the
chairmanship," said Watkins, who took the top board post from Reed. "He's like a
wrecking ball at this point. Everything we try to build up, he tries to tear
down."
</P>
<P>
	   Reed's main objection was over the firing of Dickerson after two seasons.
Reed said Alabama State planned to pay Dickerson the remaining three years of
his contract while giving him other duties. He said it was a violation of
Alabama State's policy.
</P>
<P>
	   "Under ASU personnel policies, a transfer can only be made to a lateral
position. There is no lateral position for a head football coach."
</P>
<P>
	   Reed said he also believed Dickerson was fired for telling school officials
that Alabama State isn't ready to move up to Division I-A. Watkins wouldn't
comment on that claim.
</P>
<P>
	   Reed has also said the school shouldn't make the move because it's hardly
competitive in Division I-AA. The Hornets were 2-9 last season.
</P>
<P>
	   Reed also objected to the hiring of Cole, who led Tennessee State to an 11-0
record last season but also was at the helm when the school was placed on three
years NCAA probation. By leaving for Alabama State, he avoided restrictions at
Tennessee State including no off-campus recruiting.
</P>
<P>
	   Like Reed, Alabama State's players also objected to the hiring of Cole and
marched to school president William Harris' office on the day of the
announcement to express that to him.
</P>
<P>
	   Reed said he would vote against making Cole's contract official during the
Feb. 11 board meeting because the hiring violated a policy which bars the hiring
of a coach while on NCAA probation. Watkins said university lawyers looked at
the language of the policy and found it to be unlawful.
</P>
<P>
	   Reed was interrupted twice during his press conference by booster Fletcher
Cooley, who accused Reed of trying to destroy the athletic department.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel that this whole thing is fragmented and divisive," Cooley said. "I
don't know what his goals are."
</P>
<P>
	   Reed shrugged Cooley off, claiming Cooley "has been mad at me since 1958."
</P>
<P>
	   The school said athletic director Curtis Williams would resign effective
Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   Williams has had his share of troubles with the athletic department,
including two lawsuits filed against him by former coaches. A jury last year
ordered Williams to pay $350,000 to a former basketball coach who claimed he was
fraudulently lured to the school. The second suit is still pending.
</P>
<P>
	   And, last May, Alabama's State's women's tennis team had to forfeit its
appearance in the NCAA tournament because Williams was unaware the team, as
Southwestern Athletic Conference champion, automatically qualified.
</P>
<P>
	   When Williams found out, he was unable to round them up and get them to the
tournament in time.
</P>
<P>
	   "The athletic department needs substantial improvement," Watkins said. "But
we've started that process with the hiring of coach Cole."

<HEADLINE> Texaco Earnings Up Fourfold  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Texaco earnings increased more than fourfold in the fourth
quarter, but missed Wall Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   Earnings excluding special items were $370 million, or 67 cents a share in
the October-December period, up from $92 million, or 15 cents a share, a year
earlier, the company said Wednesday. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson
Financial had expected profits of 68 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Including special items, such as asset writedowns and employee separation
costs, earnings were $318 million, or 58 cents a share, compared with a loss of
$213 million, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue at the oil company, the nation's second-largest after Exxon Mobil
Corp., was $10.56 billion in the fourth quarter, up 35 percent from $7.81
billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Texaco shares fell $2.43, or 4 percent, to $54.25 in trading at 5:15 p.m. on
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter I. Bijur, Texaco chairman and chief executive officer, said in a
statement accompanying the results that earnings "benefited significantly from
the dramatic rise in crude oil prices," but the company couldn't raise prices
for its refined products in line with the increases in crude.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, earnings from oil and gas exploration and production rose
strongly, while those from refining and marketing were lackluster.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said that U.S. crude prices averaged $20.50 a barrel in the
fourth quarter, more than double the $9.74 of a year earlier. For the year,
domestic crude was $14.70 a barrel, up from $10.60 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, net income excluding special items was $1.21 billion, or
$2.21 a share, compared with $894 million, or $1.59 a share, in 1998. Including
special items, earnings for 1999 were $1.18 billion, or $2.14 a share, up from
the 1998 total of $578 million, or 99 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue was $35.7 billion, a 12.6 percent increase from $31.71 billion in
1998.

<HEADLINE> Writer: Auschwitz Lacked Gas Vents  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A British writer disputed historically-accepted witness
accounts that thousands were poisoned to death at Auschwitz, saying Wednesday
that the crematoriums at the notorious Nazi concentration camp had no openings
to introduce gas.
</P>
<P>
	   David Irving, 62, is suing American academic Deborah Lipstadt in the High
Court over her 1994 book, ``Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth
and Memory,'' which he says maintains he denies the Holocaust and distorted
statistics.
</P>
<P>
	   Irving has outraged Jews and other Holocaust survivors by saying the
Holocaust has been exaggerated and by challenging the number and manner of
Jewish concentration camp deaths under Adolf Hitler's regime. He is the author
of several books on the academic fringe, including ``Hitler's War.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lipstadt, holder of the Dorot Chair in Modern Jewish and Holocaust Studies
at Emory University in Atlanta, and the publishers Penguin deny libel.
</P>
<P>
	   Under British law, a libel claimant only needs to prove that his reputation
has been damaged. Truth is not necessarily a defense.
</P>
<P>
	   Irving said researchers who photographed the collapsed roof of Auschwitz's
Crematorium Two -- destroyed by the Nazis as Russian troops approached -- found
no holes for inserting gas.
</P>
<P>
	   But Prof. Robert van Pelt, a historian who gave evidence for Lipstadt and
Penguin, cited ``massive amounts'' of witness accounts, photos and the drawings
of a sonderkommando, a Jewish inmate selected to work at the crematoria that
proved the camp was used for mass murder.
</P>
<P>
	   He referred to several photos, including one taken by an SS man in February,
1943 which showed openings on the new roof of Crematorium Two that he said fed
deadly Zyklon B pellets into the crematorium.
</P>
<P>
	   Irving has addressed neo-Nazi groups in Austria and Germany. In 1992, German
authorities fined him for claiming the historically-accepted accounts of German
gas chambers was British ``propaganda.'' He is banned from Germany, Canada and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
	   The case, which began on Jan. 11, is expected to last 12 weeks.

<HEADLINE> Bush, GOP Court Hispanics  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Targeting a traditionally Democratic group, George W.
Bush is set to run Spanish-language ads in Arizona and beyond as the Republican
Party works to attract the nation's fastest-growing population.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor is not only hunting for votes on Sen. John McCain's home
turf; he's also looking ahead to the general election and hoping to reverse the
Democrats' advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, the Republican National Committee is preparing a
multimillion-dollar ad campaign aimed at improving the party's image among
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush ads all include the tag line ``es un nuevo dia,'' meaning ``it's a
new day,'' and that's just the message Republicans hope to send.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a new day in America. There's a new leader. Positive. Inclusive,''
says a Spanish-speaking narrator in the new TV spot, which features Bush with
Hispanics in Texas. The ad will begin running next week on Spanish-language TV
stations in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
	   Hispanics gave most of their votes to President Clinton in 1992 and 1996,
and they have played pivotal roles in other races, helping elect Democrat Gray
Davis as governor of California in 1998, for instance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The challenge we have, of course, is showing George W. Bush is a new kind
of Republican,'' said Lionel Sosa, who is producing Bush's Spanish ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   It helps that Bush speaks the language. In 1998, he took half the Hispanic
vote in his Texas re-election. McCain has done well, too, taking a majority of
the Hispanic vote in his races.
</P>
<P>
	   In Iowa, Bush advertised on Spanish-language radio and in newspapers, and he
plans to run TV ads in every state that has Spanish stations, Sosa said. In
Arizona, the campaign will run its TV ad often enough that the average viewer
will see it four to six times before the primary on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls show McCain and Bush in a tight race in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's camp says he is the first presidential candidate to use Spanish TV
ads in a primary, though they have long been used in general elections. In fact,
the first came as early as 1960, when Jacqueline Kennedy spoke Spanish in an ad
for her husband, said Julian Kanter, founder of a center at the University of
Oklahoma that archives political ads.
</P>
<P>
	   They are used, he said, because they are effective.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When you speak somebody else's language, you're saying to them, 'I'm
really interested in you,''' Kanter said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican National Committee is hoping to capitalize, too. It plans to
spend $7 million to $10 million on image ads -- one in Spanish -- beginning this
spring in about 10 states.
</P>
<P>
	   It will take awhile for the message to get through, said Leslie Sanchez of
the RNC. But she said polling indicates the Hispanic vote is open to
competition.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats see Hispanics as being ``at the bottom,'' she said, whereas
Republicans are appealing to their upwardly mobile nature. ``Democrats have
allowed Hispanics to be comfortable in their own poverty,'' Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats don't accept that view and believe they can keep Hispanics under
their tent, said Jenny Backus, spokeswoman for the Democratic National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Hispanic community is more sophisticated than having someone just
speak the language and go in and pose for photos,'' she said. ``They're going to
look at the record, at what party is going to deliver for them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hispanics care deeply about education and health care, Backus said, and
polls show Democrats with the edge on these issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanchez acknowledged that Republicans have to adjust as they campaign for
Hispanic votes, and she said they have talked about these strategies among
themselves. But she agreed it's not easy. ``You're going to have people on both
sides that may or may not understand -- or support -- the effort.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans cut legal immigrants off Medicaid and food stamps, for instance,
and have tried to keep illegal immigrant children out of public schools.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, the leading GOP presidential candidates have supported
some Hispanic issues, said Cecilia Munoz of the National Council of La Raza, the
nation's largest Hispanic advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Governor Bush and Senator McCain get a lot of points for not trashing
immigrants,'' she said. ``But the best you can say is on key emotional and
substantive issues there are some mixed signals coming from the Republican
Party.''

<HEADLINE> Colombia Leader Addresses Mayors  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Colombian President Andres Pastrana told American mayors
on Wednesday that a proposed $1.6 billion package to aid his country's anti-drug
efforts would bring ``very real benefits to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
	   The two-year package, unveiled earlier this month, is designed mostly to
combat drug trafficking, but also would bolster Colombia's sagging economy and
address social problems. Colombia is by far the world's largest exporter of
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   Pastrana took his campaign for the package to the U.S. Conference of Mayors
after saying he met with Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and two
other Republican senators deeply involved on the anti-drug front: Paul Coverdell
of Georgia and Mike DeWine of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional sources said later that Pastrana met with Lott but did not
meet with Coverdell and DeWine. There was no immediate explanation for the
discrepancy.
</P>
<P>
	   Lott said afterward he is generally supportive of Pastrana's approach but
told the Colombian leader that it was important that he show progress.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think the American people are going to want to just keep pouring
money into that situation if they don't make progress in terms of stopping the
growing of coca and stopping the drug running in the air and on the water,''
Lott said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pastrana, who met with Clinton on Tuesday, said he was optimistic about
prospects for the bill after his consultations on Capitol Hill. He called the
case for helping Colombia in its struggle ``clear and compelling.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be important for Congress to hear from America's mayors in the
days and weeks ahead that this initiative is not just in Colombia's interest but
also America's,'' said Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Your voices will help ensure that this critical initiative is not
sidetracked by other legislative priorities or doomed by partisanship or
politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   The issue of illegal drug trafficking and consumption ``is one that all of
you must address every day,'' Pastrana told the mayors.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, at a breakfast meeting with reporters, Pastrana expressed optimism
about prospects for a settlement in Columbia's long-running war with leftist
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the rebels may be more ready than ever to seek a peace settlement,
citing recent conciliatory statements by their leaders as well as an evident
weariness with decades of armed struggle.
</P>
<P>
	   He noted that the leader of the FARC rebel group, Manuel Marulanda, said
recently for the first time that ``he sees the peace process as something that
could go forward.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pastrana also said that the rebels, far from seeking a Cuba-style revolution
in Colombia, seem willing to accept a multiparty democratic system.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am very optimistic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Skepticism by many on Capitol Hill about the proposed aid package is based
partly on the human rights record of the Colombian Army and the suspicion of
links between the army and paramilitary units.
</P>
<P>
	   Pastrana said abuses by the military have dropped precipitously since 1994,
when there were allegations of 2,000 such cases. He said there were but 70 last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., has said the Colombian Army must show a greater
willingness to turn over personnel accused of rights violations and a concerted
effort to thwart the paramilitary groups believed to be responsible for
thousands of deaths over the years.

<HEADLINE> Dow Jones Earnings Jump 40 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Dow Jones &AMP; Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal,
reported a 40 percent jump in quarterly profits due to strong growth in
advertising.
</P>
<P>
	   Dow Jones said Wednesday it earned $77.2 million in the fourth quarter, or
85 cents per share, up from $55.4 million, or 59 cents per share, in the same
period a year ago. The earnings trounced analyst expectations of 76 cents per
share, as reported by Thomson Financial/First Call.
</P>
<P>
	   The fourth-quarter results did not include a $16.3 million loss on the sale
of IDD Enterprises, a financial database Dow Jones acquired in 1995. Including
the loss, earnings were $60.9 million or 67 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues rose 14 percent to $559.4 million from $491.9 million in the fourth
quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Print publishing revenues rose 27 percent, led by another strong quarter of
advertising growth at The Wall Street Journal, which posted a 36 percent gain in
ad lineage.
</P>
<P>
	   Electronic publishing revenues rose 7 percent, including the company's 50
percent interest in Factiva, an interactive business news venture set up with
Reuters last July. Dow Jones said it added 45,000 subscribers during the quarter
to wsj.com, the online version of the Journal, bringing its subscriber base to
375,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Dow Jones also posted its first quarterly profit in television since getting
into the business in 1993. Dow Jones owns half of CNBC's operations in Europe
and Asia, and contributes news to CNBC in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, Dow Jones earned $222.4 million, or $2.44 per share,
compared to $185 million, or $1.92 per share, in 1998. The year-ago figures did
not included losses related to the sale of its Telerate subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues for the year, excluding Telerate, rose 7 percent to $2 billion from
$1.87 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to The Wall Street Journal, Dow Jones also publishes Barron's
and SmartMoney magazines, Dow Jones Newswires, the Ottaway community newspapers
and a number of stock indicators, including the widely-quoted Dow Jones
industrial average.

<HEADLINE> Merck Profits Up 12 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Merck &AMP; Co. said Wednesday its fourth-quarter profits rose
12 percent on the strength of several top-selling medicines. The results matched
Wall Street's expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   Merck, the largest U.S. drugmaker, reported earnings of $1.57 billion, or 66
cents per share, up from $1.40 billion, or 58 cents per share, a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales rose 19 percent to $8.96 billion from $7.53 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Merck's fastest-selling products included its cholesterol-lowering drug
Zocor, osteoporosis drug Fosamax and hypertension drugs Cozaar and Hyzaar.
</P>
<P>
	   Also spurring sales was Vioxx, an arthritis pill which Merck introduced in
May. Vioxx has gradually stolen market share from another new arthritis pill,
Celebrex, which was introduced last year by Monsanto and Pfizer Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., earned $5.89
billion or $2.45 per share, up from $5.25 billion or $2.15 per share in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales rose 22 percent for the year to $32.71 billion from $26.90 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Merck-Medco, the company's pharmacy benefit manager, handled 370 million
prescriptions in 1999, a 16 percent increase from the prior year.
</P>
<P>
	   Merck said it was comfortable with current analysts' forecasts for earnings
per share of $2.73 to $2.81 for all of 2000. It said it expected earnings to
reach the upper portion of this range.
</P>
<P>
	   Merck stock rose $1.93 to $72.81 1/4 a share in trading at 5:15 p.m. on the

<HEADLINE> New York digs out from nor'easter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   COHOES, N.Y. (AP) - From foreign exchange students who needed to take a
critical test, to volunteer firefighters who slogged away from home to protect
others, to kids who enjoyed the timeless thrill of a snow day, New Yorkers dug
out of a two-day nor'easter on Wednesday.
<P>
	   The storm that began with flurries Tuesday morning and snowballed into
headlines like "Snow beast rushes in" dumped more than 2 feet of snow in some
areas of the state and is blamed on two highway deaths. Yet some of the state's
traditional snowiest spots - parts of central New York and the Adirondacks -
recorded just 2 to 4 inches Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   It was enough, however, to shut down school districts throughout the state
and throw an ice pick into the works of the state Education Department. Some of
the schools that closed around the state still offered the 8:30 a.m. Regents
even though bus transportation was canceled and some roads were treacherous.
</P>
<P>
	   This year's seniors are the first who must pass the state's English Regents
exam to graduate as part of the program to raise standards. Seniors who who
failed or didn't take the test in 11th grade and who missed the test Wednesday
will have just one more shot - in June - if they are to graduate with their
class, according to Bill Hirschen of the state Education Department.
</P>
<P>
	   But a survey by the state Education Department of the state's biggest urban
and high-needs districts indicates very few students were effected, Hirschen
said. No specific figures were available. Of 45 districts surveyed covering
about half of the state's students surveyed, five districts didn't give the
test, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm that closed the schools wasn't over until well into Wednesday,
three rush hours after it began. Dozens of accidents were reported, although few
involved injuries. One woman, 61-year-old Catherine Simmons of Kingston, died
Tuesday afternoon when her car collided with the rear of a snow plow on the
Thruway in Saugerties.
</P>
<P>
	   Maryann Merritt, 35, of Troy, and five other relatives, ages 5, 8, 9, 12 and
16, were being treated Wednesday at hospitals from Albany to Kingston. The plow
driver wasn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Rochester suburb of Chili, a couple's car skidded on ice and slammed
into an oncoming pickup truck Tuesday, killing passenger Marianne Scarpino, 60,
and seriously injuring her husband, Ronald, 62. The impact sent the car sliding
sideways into a tree. The pickup driver suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   The heaviest snowfall in some areas in three or four years was a surprise to
many, and just bad timing for some.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of miles from home, exchange students Stephanie Abel, 17, of
Germany and Kateirna Zafirovska, 17, of Macedonia plowed a new, borrowed car
through a foot of snow that closed Cohoes High School in order to take the
Regents English test. Five months in the United States, the seniors had found
out days before that they needed to pass the test to graduate.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was bad and it was slippery," said Zafirovska of the ride to the school.
"Many didn't make it to the test."
</P>
<P>
	   Getting to school was the last thing on the mind of some.
</P>
<P>
	   In Rochester, a group of high school friends whizzed 300 to 400 feet down
Cobbs Hill on sleds atop eight to 12 inches of fresh, fluffy snow.
</P>
<P>
	   "My head's ready to explode, I was going so fast," offered Mark Barry, 17,
looking for a spell of relaxation during mid-term exam week.
</P>
<P>
	   In Albany, fifth grader Rayanna Wilson and her cousin, third grader Kyrie
Whineglass, were all business on their "snow day."
</P>
<P>
	   Ignoring the cold and the gusts that strafed their faces with bits of icy
snow, they meticulously carved igloos with a broken shovel out of the snow banks
along the street. Rayanna's itinerary: igloos, sledding in the back yard,
shopping at Kmart.
</P>
<P>
	   With the mercury drooping into the teens, winds up to 20 mph made it feel as
cold as 10 below zero near Rochester, while temperatures hovered under 20
degrees in most other parts of the state. Up to 15 inches of snow generated by
Lake Ontario fell in the suburbs east of Rochester. By contrast, Buffalo escaped
with an inch or less. The Hudson Valley reported more than 14 inches of snow in
some areas, with much of eastern New York getting about 10 inches.
</P>
<P>
	   Lake-effect snow was expected to add several inches to central New York and
the Finger Lakes region by Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the snow forecast for eastern New York ended Wednesday, but not soon
enough for a quiet night at home for members of the S.W. Pitts volunteer fire
company in Latham, N.Y. As in many volunteer fire departments, more than a dozen
firefighters stayed overnight at S.W. Pitts on spartan beds and in the
stationhouse on alert during the storm.
</P>
<P>
	   "Anytime we have a big storm - a snow storm or heavy rain when there can be
flooding - we go on standby," said fire company President John D'Allaird, a
volunteer for 39 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Just before 1:30 a.m. Wednesday, the storm was subsiding enough to send the
standby crew home. At 1:38 a.m. the alarm sounded for a house fire. More than a
dozen firefighters returned and got to the scene where the small fire was
quickly contained, said Capt. Warren Carr Jr., who got the call 12 minutes after
he arrived home after more than seven hours at the fire house.
</P>
<P>
	   Four hours later and five miles south in downtown Albany, Jay and Cliff
Brown were opening the Miss Albany Diner, a landmark in Naugahyde and linoleum
for a clientele ranging from factory workers to top state officials. It has
opened rain or shine or snow every working morning since 1941.
</P>
<P>
	   To make sure it opened, the Browns stayed in Albany overnight Tuesday rather
than snake their way home to rural Eagle Bridge across the Hudson River during
the early stages of the storm.
</P>
<P>
	   "The only thing you can predict is business during snow storms," laughed
Cliff Brown in the vintage diner developers today spend millions trying to
re-create. "A rotten, cold miserable day is good business. Just a miserable day
is great business."

<HEADLINE> 3M Earnings Rise 28 Percent  </HEADLINE>
    By KARREN MILLS AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co., maker of Scotch
tape and Post-It notes, reported a 28 percent rise in fourth-quarter profits
Wednesday, driven by strong sales of new products and a rebound in Asia.
</P>

	   For the quarter ended Dec. 31, 3M earned $444 million, or $1.10 per share,
compared with $348 million, or 86 cents a share, excluding a non-recurring
restructuring charge taken in the final quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The earnings easily beat analyst expectations of $1.02 per share, as
reported by First Call/Thomson Financial. 3M's stock jumped more than 5 percent
at 5:15 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange, rising $4.93 3/4 to $96.31 1/4.

	   "We're pleased with our record fourth-quarter and full-year 1999 results,"
said L.D. DeSimone, chairman and chief executive. "Our volume growth increased
during each quarter of 1999, and we enter 2000 with good momentum."
</P>
<P>
	   DeSimone said 3M generated 34 percent of its 1999 sales from products new to
the market within the past four years, including microflex electronic circuits
used in printers and computers, performance cleaning cloths and pharmaceutical
products such as CFC-free asthma inhalers.
</P>
<P>
	   3M said sales and profit growth were particularly strong in Asia.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our people did an expert job navigating through difficult challenges in
Asia during 1998, and we emerged in 1999 with even stronger customer
relationships and competitive positions," DeSimone said.

	   For the full year, 3M earned $1.71 billion, or $4.21 a share, compared with
$1.53 billion, or $3.74 a share, excluding restructuring in 1998. Revenues in
1999 rose to $15.66 billion, from $15.02 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Including restructuring charges, 1998 fourth quarter net income was $211
million, or 52 cents a share, and full-year net income was $1.18 billion, or
$2.88 a share.

<HEADLINE> McDonald's Profits Gain 9 Percent  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- McDonald's Corp. reported a 9 percent gain in fourth-quarter
earnings Wednesday as booming sales in North America and Europe offset shaky
performances in Japan and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
	   The modest gains provided a solid finish to a year in which the world's
largest fast-food chain further shored up its rapidly expanding international
operations while still posting strong gains at home.
</P>
<P>
	   The earnings fell slightly short of Wall Street expectations, however, and
shares in the Oak Brook, Ill., company fell $4.18 3/4, nearly 11 percent, to
$35.62 1/2 in trading at 5:15 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   McDonald's earned $486.2 million in the quarter, or 35 cents a share. That
compared with year-ago earnings of $348.5 million, or 25 cents a share,
excluding costs of $146 million for the Made For You computerized cooking
program and a one-time charge of $160 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had forecast earnings of
36 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   For the full year, net income was $1.95 billion, or $1.39 a share, up 10
percent from $1.55 billion, or $1.10 a share, for 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Westra, a securities analyst for CS First Boston, said the fourth
quarter was somewhat "sloppy," but on the whole 1999 was a "good year" for
McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were a little bit weaker than expected in top-line international
results, including Japan, Brazil and Russia. But in our view the sloppy
quarter's behind them, and investors can expect to begin looking at positive
results in the first quarter of 2000."
</P>
<P>
	   McDonald's revenues for the fourth quarter rose 5 percent, to $3.37 billion
from $3.22 billion. Revenues for 1999 climbed 7 percent, to $13.26 billion from
$12.42 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   McDonald's added 1,790 restaurants in 1999 -- more than 90 percent outside
the United States -- and plans to add 1,800 to 1,900 more this year, said Jack
Greenberg, chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
	   Results in Japan fell off sharply in the second half of the year, which the
company blamed on economic weakness there.
</P>
<P>
	   Operating income in Latin America declined 8 percent in 1999. McDonald's
cited the currency devaluation in Brazil and resulting economic problems in
several markets in the region.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Military Rips Islamic Party  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey's powerful military on Wednesday accused the
Islamic Virtue Party of aiding in the rise of radical groups and issued a thinly
veiled warning that such actions could lead to the party's closure.
</P>
<P>
	   The military said Virtue was ``supporting fundamentalism, allowing it to
flourish and develop'' and held it responsible for the rise of radical groups.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Turkish armed forces, with the support of the Turkish people, will
never allow this mentality to reach its goal,'' the statement from the fiercely
secular military read.
</P>
<P>
	   The military reminded Virtue that ``political parties representing this
mentality have been closed three times.''
</P>
<P>
	   Virtue faces closure by the constitutional court for anti-secular
activities.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest rise in tension between the military and the Islamic party comes
amid the recent discovery of 33 bodies of people slain by a militant Islamic
group.
</P>
<P>
	   The state, including the armed forces, has been facing harsh criticism in
the press by commentators who say Turkey turned a blind eye and may even have
backed the Hezbollah group, which killed hundreds of Marxist Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   Virtue Party leader Recai Kutan accused the military of fighting his group
while ignoring Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
	   Virtue, the third largest party in parliament, controls Turkey's two most
important cities, Istanbul and Ankara. The party has denied any links with
Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
	   The military pressured a government led by another Islamic party out of
power in 1997. That party was subsequently banned for violating Turkey's secular
constitution.

<HEADLINE> BCE To Spin Off $50B Nortel Stake  </HEADLINE>
    By BRUCE MEYERSON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- BCE Inc. plans to spin off its 37 percent stake in Nortel
Networks, worth about $50 billion, by distributing some 540 million shares in
the Internet equipment maker to BCE stockholders.
</P>
<P>
	   The move would sever a centurylong link between BCE, the Canadian telephone
giant formerly known as Bell Canada, and its former equipment arm -- a business
that's emerged as a major force in the technology industry thanks to the
frenzied growth of the Web and electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
	   Nortel, whose revenues grew 26 percent to $21 billion last year, is one of
the top producers of fiber-optic gear that can speed up the "backbone" networks
that make up the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   The divestiture by BCE closely mirrors the decision by AT&AMP;T, the former U.S.
telephone monopoly, to spin off its communications equipment arm back in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   That spinoff created Lucent Technologies, which also happens to be Nortel's
main rival in fiber optics and other key communications technologies.
</P>
<P>
	   Under BCE's plan, its shareholders will get 0.78 of a Nortel share,
currently worth about $78, for every BCE share they own.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday before the announcement, Nortel's stock slid 8 percent amid a
sharp downturn by technology stocks, falling $8.93 3/4 per share to $99.37 1/2
on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Nortel's high-flying shares rose by almost the same amount on Tuesday, when
the company reported strong results for the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Trading in BCE's shares was halted just before the announcement at 4 p.m.
EST, when the stock was up $3.50 at $99.50 for the day.
</P>
<P>
	   The development could provide a boost for Nortel's stock, not that it needs
much help: The company's market value has nearly quadrupled over the past year,
and the company announced another stock split on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Nortel, based in Brampton, Ontario, applauded the move by BCE, saying it
would remove certain obstacles that may have discouraged some institutional
investors from investing in Nortel.
</P>
<P>
	   "This releases Nortel as a truly independent global internet powerhouse,"
said Clarence Chandran, president of Nortel's Carrier Packet Solutions unit.
</P>
<P>
	   By releasing such an enormous amount of stock into the market, big purchases
or sales of Nortel's shares by a mutual fund or other major investors would be
less likely to affect Nortel's share price -- overall, there are 1.36 billion
shares outstanding.
</P>
<P>
	   And although BCE doesn't have management control of Nortel, there may have
been concerns about BCE's influence.
</P>
<P>
	   "Relative to other technology companies in the U.S. and Canada, we are
underweight in the support of institutional investors," said Bill Kerr, senior
vice president of finance and business development at Nortel. "Institutional
investors are always concerned about a large shareholder in a company and what's
going to happen. They like to be able to move in freely and buy a stock without
moving the market."

<HEADLINE> Norfolk Southern Earnings Drop  </HEADLINE>
    By SONJA BARISIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- Norfolk Southern Corp. said Wednesday that
fourth-quarter earnings fell 81 percent as the railroad dealt with congestion
problems related to its takeover of Conrail lines.
</P>
<P>
	   The company also announced a voluntary early retirement program that it said
was its first step toward containing operating expenses, which it blamed for the
earnings decline. About 1,180 employees are eligible, the railroad said.
</P>
<P>
	   Norfolk Southern said it earned $31 million, or 8 cents a share, for the
quarter, compared with $160 million, or 42 cents a share, a year earlier.
Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected the company to
earn 10 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues for the quarter were $1.47 billion, up 43 percent from $1.03
billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Norfolk Southern's shares fell $1.06 1/4 to $17.75, or nearly 6 percent, in
trading at 5:15 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Norfolk Southern Corp., based in Norfolk, Va., is the holding company for
the Norfolk Southern Railway, which has extensive freight service east of the
Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
	   The October-December period was the second full quarter in which Norfolk
Southern operated its portion of Conrail lines. Norfolk Southern and
Richmond-based CSX carved up Conrail's northeastern freight routes in a $10.3
billion takeover last June.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said that railway operating expenses were $1.33 billion in the
fourth quarter, up 71 percent from a year earlier as the company worked to
integrate the former Conrail lines and relieve congestion on the routes.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, Norfolk Southern earned $239 million, or 63 cents a share,
compared with $734 million, or $1.93 a share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue was $5.2 billion, up 23 percent from $4.22 billion in 1998.

<HEADLINE> General Dynamics Earnings Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    FALLS CHURCH, Va. (AP) -- General Dynamics reported a 24 percent increase in
fourth-quarter profits thanks largely to strong sales in its aerospace division.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense contractor had earnings of $198 million in the quarter ended
Dec. 31, or 98 cents per share, up from $160 million, or 79 cents per share, a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   The results were three cents higher than Wall Street analysts' expectations,
according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues rose 2 percent to $2.66 billion from $2.21 billion in the same
period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's acquisition last year of Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. continued
to pay off. Earnings in the aerospace division were $141 million, up 31 percent,
and Gulfstream received orders for 44 aircraft and options for 10 more during
the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Results in the company's submarine and shipbuilding group were lower for the
quarter compared with the same period in 1998. For the full year, however, sales
increased 22 percent and earnings increased 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues rose 12 percent to $398 million in the company's combat systems
group, which has contracts with the Army and Egypt to build Abrams tanks.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, General Dynamics reported net earnings of $715 million, or
$3.54 per share, up 22 percent over 1998 earnings of $589 million, or $2.91 per
share. Year-end sales were $8.96 billion, up from $7.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   General Dynamics, based in Falls Church, has 43,000 employees worldwide.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Poll: Women feel pressed at home, still see barriers at work  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A majority of women say combining career, marriage and
children is the best recipe for a satisfying life, but the strains of balancing
all three elements may actually be making working mothers unhappy, according to
a poll released Wednesday.
<P>
	   Researchers found 64 percent of working mothers believe having a career and
family is the most fulfilling path. But only 40 percent of married women with
children and full-time jobs said they were very satisfied with their lives,
compared to 59 percent of women with children but no jobs, and 56 percent of
mothers who work part-time.
</P>
<P>
	   The findings were reported in the Virginia Slims Opinion Poll of women.
</P>
<P>
	   "Increasingly, women are looking for an integrated life, and with the
increasing number of hours that everyone is spending at work ... that is
becoming harder and harder," said Carolyn Setlow, an executive at Roper Starch
Worldwide, which conducted the poll of 2,177 women and 826 men.
</P>
<P>
	   "Women are more stressed than men, and something has to give," she added.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 to 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Although 84 percent of working mothers said they feel confident about their
ability to juggle work and family, 87 percent said there was too much pressure
for women trying to balance such responsibilities and 66 percent said
conflicting demands put them under a lot of stress.
</P>
<P>
	   Many working mothers appear to feel stretched too thin.
</P>
<P>
	   Forty-three percent said they have trouble giving work their full attention,
and 62 percent said working extra hours creates conflicts for them.
</P>
<P>
	   Setlow said overwhelming numbers of women told the pollsters that the most
important thing to them was being independent and in control of their lives.
</P>
<P>
	   "They tell us they are experiencing less freedom and more restrictions than
men," Setlow said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Women really want to be in the driver's seat of their own lives," she
added. "They're turning to their employers at work and to their spouses and
partners at home to support them in this important goal."
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the stresses, 35 percent of working mothers said they consider their
jobs a source of great personal satisfaction, and 72 percent said their job
means more to them than just money. Only 34 percent said they would not work if
they did not have to.
</P>
<P>
	   And men with families may experience some of the same conflicts as women.
</P>
<P>
	   Forty-five percent of working men polled said their job makes it harder to
do things for their family, and 40 percent said they feel guilty about not
spending more time with family.
</P>
<P>
	   But women say they still do most of the work at home. Those women polled
said they do more than their mate when it comes to laundry, routine
housecleaning and cooking.
</P>
<P>
	   And it's not always much better at work, where women said they still face
gender bias.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifty percent of women polled said there were more advantages to being a man
than a woman and the proportion is rising. In 1974, 31 percent of women said it
was more advantageous to be a man, and in 1980, 40 percent said so.
</P>
<P>
	   Sixty-four percent of employed women said they feel they have as good a
chance as men of getting responsibility at work, down from 73 percent of women
who said so in 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   Women also said there was discrimination against women trying to get
executive jobs in business (57 percent of those polled thought so), top jobs in
government (56 percent) and top jobs in the professions (51 percent).
</P>
<P>
	   "A majority feel that men have greater access to positions of leadership,"
Setlow said. "That this inequality at the top creates a ripple effect."

<HEADLINE> Sara Lee Earnings Rise 5 Percent  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Sara Lee Corp. reported Wednesday that its quarterly profits
excluding one-time charges rose 5 percent despite continuing weakness in its
food operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Solid sales gains in household and body care, food service distribution and
coffee and tea enabled the company to overcome another poor quarter for foods.
</P>
<P>
	   Earnings for the October-December period, the second quarter of Sara Lee's
fiscal year, were $389 million, or 42 cents a share. That compared with $371
million, or 39 cents a share, a year earlier, excluding special items including
a charge for a processed-meat recall.
</P>
<P>
	   The earnings matched the estimate from analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales were $5.33 billion for the quarter, up less than 1 percent from $5.29
billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Sara Lee stock rose 62 1/2 cents, or more than 3 percent, to $18.81 1/4 on
the New York Stock Exchange. It had touched its 52-week low of $18.06 1/4 on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the report showed the Chicago-based company -- the world's leader in
packaged meats sales -- is still smarting from the effects of the recall of 15
million pounds of hot dogs and other meats in December 1998. Packaged meats
sales slipped 7 percent for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   At least five lawsuits have been filed against Sara Lee over an outbreak of
food poisoning that killed 15 people and sickened hundreds of others in 1998,
prompting the recalls.
</P>
<P>
	   Sara Lee Foods' showing was further hurt by a 10 percent drop in worldwide
sales of Sara Lee Bakery products, which analysts said results partly from a
mixed track record for new items. Sara Lee is the U.S. leader in frozen baked
goods.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first six months of the fiscal year, net income was $647 million, or
70 cents a share, compared with $660 million, or 69 cents a share, in 1998. The
1998 earnings were 64 cents a share, excluding special items, the company said.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first six months of the fiscal year, sales edged up 1.3 percent to
$10.28 billion from $10.15 billion a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Polaroid Shoots Back From Loss  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Camera and film maker Polaroid earned $28.5 million
in the fourth quarter, bouncing back from a loss of $75.5 million a year ago,
thanks to strong demand for cameras.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues rose to $649.8 million in the quarter ending Dec. 31, up 20 percent
from the $541.8 million sales figure from the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Polaroid sold 9.7 million instant cameras and more than 400,000 digital
cameras last year. New products like the I-Zone Instant Pocket Camera, JoyCam,
and the Photo MAX line of digital cameras helped fuel the better results.
</P>
<P>
	   Gains were strongest in Asia, where Polaroid had a 29 percent rise in sales.
Revenues in North America rose 23 percent, and European sales rose 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Polaroid earned 64 cents per share, up from the fourth quarter of 1998 when
it lost $1.72. Wednesday's earnings met the expectations of Wall Street analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   For the full year, Polaroid earned $8.7 million, or 20 cents a share,
compared to a $51 million, $1.15 a share, loss for the full year 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues rose 7 percent to $1.98 billion from $1.85 billion.

<HEADLINE> Ford Earnings Up 8 Percent  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. ended a banner year with an 8 percent
increase in fourth-quarter operating earnings, thanks to the voracious American
appetite for trucks and sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   But while Ford and General Motors Corp. pumped up their profits to new highs
on North American sales last year, they were far less successful elsewhere
around the globe, where competition is fierce and buyers are finicky.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the healthy balance sheet, Ford's stock fell Wednesday due to a
warning to industry analysts that a lack of U.S. capacity could make earnings
targets for the first quarter of this year hard to meet.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Ford fell $2.12 1/2 to $48 in trading at 5:15 p.m. on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   The world's second-largest automaker earned $1.8 billion, or $1.47 a share,
compared to operating earnings of $1.67 billion, or $1.35 a share, in the final
three months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1998 results do not include a charge of $631 million for employee
reduction programs. For that quarter, Ford had net income of $1.04 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The earnings results beat Wall Street expectations by 2 cents a share, as
measured by First Call/Thompson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues for the quarter totaled $44 billion, an increase of 17 percent over
$38 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "Definitely the earnings were very strong, and North America continues to
lead the way," said Nicholas Lobaccaro, an analyst with Lehman Brothers. "Those
operations generate a lot of cash."
</P>
<P>
	   Ford earned $1.6 billion on its North American vehicle business in the
quarter, a 14 percent jump over last year, on revenues of $27 billion.
Meanwhile, Ford's European operations lost $55 million, while in South America,
Ford lost $95 million.
</P>
<P>
	   In the United States, Ford has harvested thick profits from its truck and
SUV lineup. It's F-Series pickups were the best-selling vehicle in the country
for 1999; Ford sells as many copies of its hulking Excursion SUV, carrying up to
$15,000 in profit per vehicle, as it can build.
</P>
<P>
	   But other markets around the world are not so strong.
</P>
<P>
	   There's little demand for SUVs in Europe, where gas is far more expensive
and space for parking a car at a premium. And in South America, struggling
economies have left automakers who spent to build new plants in a lurch. The
result has been large losses for both Ford and GM.
</P>
<P>
	   "In North America, our momentum is very strong and our results in the region
show the fundamental strength of our brands when the products are right and the
costs are right," said Ford president and CEO Jac Nasser. "Our results in Europe
and South America are unacceptable, but we are making product investments that
will deliver more hits."
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, Ford chief financial officer Henry Wallace said Ford might close a
European factory to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's clear we have excess capacity, but that's only one part of what we
need to do in Europe," Wallace said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said Ford had told them that first-quarter earnings target could be
a stretch because of the U.S. production changes. This year, Ford will put
several new truck models into production, such as the Ford Explorer Sport, an
SUV-pickup combo, and the Ford Escape/Mazda Tribute small SUVs aimed at models
from Honda and Toyota. Ford has said it has also run short of some popular
engines, including the V-8s used in its SUVs.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're at the limits of their capacity right now," said Richard Hilgert,
an analyst with Fahnestock &AMP; Co. "With new products in the first and second
half, its going to be difficult for the company to get much better (results)."
</P>
<P>
	   But analysts said Ford called estimates for all of 2000 realistic, and that
there was no sign the strong U.S. car and light truck market will falter.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're in a very strong environment," Wallace said. "We think the industry
will be down a little bit in the United States, but on the other side we see
some opportunities."
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, Ford earned $7.2 billion, or $5.86 per share, up 22 percent
over operating earnings of $5.9 billion, or $4.72 a share, in 1998. Of that
total, $5.7 billion came from its automotive operations, with a healthy North
American business making up for a $452 million loss in South America.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Organizers Have Snow Plan  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Olympic organizers said Wednesday they'll haul snow in
from Colorado if that's what it takes to stage next week's scheduled U.S.
biathlon national championships at Soldier Hollow.
</P>
<P>
	Rain and temperatures in the upper 30s have turned the venue for cross country
skiing and biathlon events at the 2002 Winter Games into a mud bog.
</P>
<P>
	``This is a construction project in progress,'' Soldier Hollow director Lyle
Nelson said. ``By next year, some of the trails will be paved or grassed over,
but right now it's really muddy. It's ankle deep.''
</P>
<P>
	Overnight temperatures through the weekend were forecast in the teens and 20s,
which would allow organizers to use Soldier Hollow's $2 million snowmaking
system to cover trails.
</P>
<P>
	``We wouldn't be doing this if we didn't think we had a good chance of getting
the event off, but we're really dependent on cold weather to help,'' said Cathy
Priestner, the Salt Lake Organizing Committee's managing director for sports.
``The athletes don't want to race somewhere else. They want to get on this
course, to check out this venue.''
</P>
<P>
	Another Olympic venue was less fortunate. On Wednesday, SLOC and U.S. Ski Team
officials said women's World Cup downhill and super-G races scheduled Feb. 11-12
at Snowbasin near Ogden will be moved, probably to Europe. Also canceled was a
women's slalom Feb. 6 at Deer Valley near Park City. Although the latter venue
had sufficient snow, FIS rules call for cancellation of both events of a
combined if one is unable to stage an event.
</P>
<P>
	While the women's Olympic downhill course has snow from top to bottom, the
issue was skier safety. Organizers said they couldn't assure there would be
enough snow near the bottom of the course to properly install safety netting.
</P>
<P>
	``It takes very special course preparation to ensure the safety of the athletes
in terms of quality and condition of the snow,'' said Alan Ashley, U.S. Ski and
Snowboard Association vice president for athletics.
</P>
<P>
	Soldier Hollow, 50 miles southeast of Salt Lake City, staged the U.S. cross
country national championships earlier this month. Three days after the last
race, rain wiped out much of the natural snow on 14 miles of trails.
</P>
<P>
	Priestner and Nelson disputed earlier reports the biathlon races, scheduled
Feb. 1-6, could move to West Yellowstone, Mont. Some races might be shifted and
others canceled, but both said it was important to use the venue.
</P>
<P>
	``Are we surprised? Sure we are,'' Nelson said. ``This is unusual weather, but
we're not unprepared.''
</P>
<P>
	If necessary, up to 200 truckloads of snow could be brought in. Organizers
weren't certain where it would come from, but sites within 30-60 miles were
being considered. Nelson mentioned Wolf Creek Pass in southwestern Colorado,
some 350 miles away, as another possibility.
</P>
<P>
	Officials also must place gravel on muddy access roads leading to Soldier
Hollow. Priestner said costs haven't been determined but that issue wasn't a
consideration.
</P>
<P>
	``We are not moving this event,'' Priestner said.
</P>
<P>
	Priestner said the unfavorable weather gives organizers practice time in case
of similar conditions during the Winter Games in February 2002. Whatever the
case, she said the Olympics will go on as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
	``As much as it's a challenge for us, we'd rather have this challenge now,''
Priestner said.

<HEADLINE> Raptors' Dell Curry Activated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TORONTO (AP) -- Toronto Raptors guard Dell Curry has been activated from the
injured list after missing 14 games with a left foot problem.
</P>
<P>
	   Curry, last available for a full game on Dec. 19, shot a league-best 47.6
percent from beyond the 3-point line last season with the Milwaukee Bucks. He is
sixth in the NBA this season.
</P>
<P>
	   The Raptors have been missing their two best 3-point specialists for a
month. Dee Brown, who led the NBA in 3-pointers made last season, has been out
since Dec. 19 with a sore left knee. Brown had surgery earlier this month and is
expected to miss at least three more weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   To make room for Curry, the Raptors placed forward Sean Marks on the injured
list with tendinitis in his left knee.

<HEADLINE> Teen Drug Use Higher in Rural Areas  </HEADLINE>
   By GENARO C. ARMAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Adolescents in small-town and rural America are much more
likely than their peers in urban centers to have used drugs, according to a
private study released Wednesday. The report urges the government to reverse the
alarming trend by funding the war on drugs in nonmetropolitan areas as well as
it does in foreign countries like Colombia.
</P>
<P>
	   Eighth-graders in rural America are 104 percent likelier than those in big
cities to use amphetamines, including methamphetamines, and 50 percent likelier
to use cocaine, according to the study released by the National Center on
Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
	   The study also found that eighth-graders in rural areas are 83 percent more
likely to use crack cocaine, and 34 percent more likely to smoke marijuana than
their urban counterparts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While people may erroneously associate drug abuse with urban communities,
drug abuse attacks our small cities and rural areas with equal ferocity,'' said
Barry McCaffrey, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control
Policy.
</P>
<P>
	   The figures, based primarily on 1999 data, were presented at the U.S.
Conference of Mayors winter meeting in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   The threat of drugs to teens and children ``is aggravated in small and
mid-size town, cities and counties that lack the resources and experience
available to large metropolitan concentrations to combat this problem,'' said
Joseph A. Califano Jr., president of the research group.
</P>
<P>
	   Califano called on the Clinton administration and Congress to put together
an ``emergency aid'' package to fight drugs in rural America that would match
``dollar-for-dollar'' the two-year, $1.6 billion aid plan the Clinton
administration proposed to Colombia, in part to assist with anti-drug efforts
there.
</P>
<P>
	   McCaffrey countered that the administration had already increased treatment
funding by 26 percent over the past four years to $3 billion, and pointed to the
office's August 1999 report which showed that drug use among those aged 12-to-17
was down 13 percent in the previous one-year period.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The impact of these counter-drug efforts will be felt not just in Bogota,
Colombia, but in Boise, Idaho and Boston, Massachusetts,'' McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
	   Califano's group used five different sets of data, from public and private
anti-drug organizations, to come up with their results, and also studied data
from state and local law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
	   Each data set defined big cities and urban centers in different ways, but in
general, classified rural areas as those with populations of 50,000 or less, and
urban centers as those with populations of 1 million or more.
</P>
<P>
	   The study also found that:
</P>
<P>
	   --Eighth-graders in rural areas were 70 percent likelier to have gotten
drunk, and 29 percent likelier to drink alcohol.
</P>
<P>
	   --Eighth-graders were more than twice as likely to smoke cigarettes, and
nearly five times more likely to use smokeless tobacco.
</P>
<P>
	   --Among 10th-graders, use rates in rural areas exceeded those in large urban
areas for every drug except marijuana and the methamphetamine known as ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
	   --Among 12th-graders, use rates in rural America exceeded those in large
urban areas for cocaine, crack, amphetamines, inhalants, alcohol, cigarettes and
smokeless tobacco.
</P>
<P>
	   --Adult drug use was about equal across communities of all sizes.

<HEADLINE> Students Open Gate at Mexico Campus  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL WEISSERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Students and professors tore down a barricade at
Mexico's premier university Wednesday to confront striking students who have
occupied the campus for nine months.
</P>
<P>
	   Crowds forced open a gate at the 280,000-student National Autonomous
University's campus in Mexico City and tore down wires and poles, allowing
scores of people to enter. There were scattered skirmishes, but no reports of
serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   Strike leaders elsewhere on campus maintained their barricades, blocking
thousands of students and teachers who were unable to get inside.
</P>
<P>
	   As police helicopters circled overhead, some strikers wearing ski masks and
bandanas screamed obscenities at students trying to get in. Those who managed to
get through the barricades spoke with the strikers, urging them to end the
standoff which has paralyzed Latin America's largest university.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This will end only if individual schools of students and faculty sit down
together and work things out,'' said Estella Sanchez, a chemistry professor who
spoke with striking students from her department. ``Most of us on both sides
don't want the strike to continue, but we can't proceed without an exchange of
ideas.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the strikers maintained the walkout is far from over.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can't end the strike without a consensus, but what we can do is reopen
the dialogue,'' said Alex, a striking chemistry student who declined to give his
last name.
</P>
<P>
	   The strike at the university popularly known by its Spanish acronym, UNAM,
began in April to protest a plan to increase annual tuition from a token few
cents to the equivalent of $140. Administrators backed off the fee increase, but
strikers' demands grew to include sweeping policy changes and a call for greater
student control.
</P>
<P>
	   Adding to Wednesday's confusion were students against the strike who entered
campus but then weren't allowed to leave. With strikers blocking all entrances,
one large group of students and professors who had slipped inside had to ask
strikers for special permission to exit the campus confines.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday's action comes one day after the university's rector, Juan Ramon
de la Fuente, went to the campus to deliver results of a referendum showing
overwhelming support for an end to the walkout. Strikers and a throng of
photographers, however, kept him from reaching the barricaded gates.
</P>
<P>
	   In newspaper ads published Wednesday, students who support de la Fuente's
proposal to end the strike urged their supporters to go to the university
Wednesday to confront the hard-line strikers. The strikers said they would
welcome dialogue -- but not on the campus.

<HEADLINE> Ca. Seeks Emissions Reduction  </HEADLINE>
   By LEON DROUIN KEITH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- California is about to give its transit systems a
choice: Replace diesel buses with cleaner natural gas ones now, or lead the way
nationally in introducing buses that produce no exhaust at all.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Air Resources Board is expected to vote on the plan Thursday.
Spokesman Jerry Martin said the plan will probably win approval, though some
details may be modified.
</P>
<P>
	   Some transit operators endorse the plan, saying it could clean the air
without forcing cost increases that could discourage use of public transit.
</P>
<P>
	   Clean-air advocates argue it doesn't do enough to discourage transit systems
from using diesel buses, which pollute much more than natural gas ones.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the plan, transit systems could choose to buy natural-gas buses as 85
percent of their purchases starting immediately.
</P>
<P>
	   Systems that choose to keep buying diesel buses must purchase a
demonstration fleet in 2003 of three buses that use hydrogen-powered fuel cells
that produce no emissions. Fuel-cell buses are not yet commercially available,
but some experimental models have been made.
</P>
<P>
	   Transit agencies that continue to buy diesel buses must make 15 percent of
their purchases ``zero-emission buses'' -- using fuel cells, batteries or
electricity -- by 2008.
</P>
<P>
	   Diesel buses cost roughly $275,000, while buses that use natural gas cost
about $40,000 more, Martin said. Zero-emission buses currently cost about twice
as much as diesel buses, and large quantities are not being produced.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal would apply to the roughly 8,500 buses in California transit
fleets, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Transit buses probably account for less than 1 percent of California's total
emissions, but their emissions linger in crowded cities, said Todd Campbell,
spokesman for the Los Angeles-based Coalition for Clean Air.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some people say, `Why pick on urban transit?' but a lot of people are less
than 1 percent of the problem, and if we thought that way we'd never go
forward,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Heminger, deputy director of the San Francisco-area Metropolitan
Transportation Commission, said requiring diesel-heavy transit agencies to
switch to natural gas now and fuel cells a decade later is too expensive.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the 27 transit systems that are part of his commission rely on
diesel, though some use electric as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal also sets limits on pollutants emitted by the diesel buses the
transit systems are allowed to buy and requires transit systems to retrofit
their entire fleets to reduce the amount of particulates produced.
</P>
<P>
	   All fleets also would have to run on low-sulfur diesel fuel, which Martin
said costs 5 cents to 6 cents more per gallon than regular diesel.
</P>
<P>
	   The board staff estimated that the changes will cost transit agencies:
</P>
<P>
	   --An average of $1.7 million a year through 2009 to retrofit diesel buses.
</P>
<P>
	   --About $3 million a year to switch to low-sulfur diesel fuel, an expense
the board's staff expects will decrease as the market for the fuel grows.
</P>
<P>
	   --More than $5 million a year to buy new buses that meet the requirements.
Federal grants would cover 80 percent of that cost.

<HEADLINE> Elian Family Wants To Join Meeting  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's father asked to be included by telephone in
the boy's Wednesday meeting with his grandmothers in Miami and asked that the
child's great-uncle not be permitted in the gathering.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter from Juan Miguel Gonzalez and Elian's two grandfathers and his
great-grandmother was printed in Wednesday's edition of the Communist Party
daily Granma.
</P>
<P>
	   They said that after the meeting, they would like Elian's grandmothers,
Mariela Quintana and Raquel Rodriguez, to return to Washington for more meetings
with lawmakers in their fight to prevent Congress from giving Elian U.S.
citizenship against his father's will.
</P>
<P>
	   In the letter, Elian's Cuban relatives asked that the grandmothers bring a
cellular phone to their two-hour meeting with the boy and asked that the
gathering be extended for a third hour with the relatives in Cuba participating
by telephone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to talk to the boy there when he is entirely free with you,'' the
letter said.
</P>
<P>
	   It also asked that the boy's Miami relatives, including Elian's great-uncle
Lazaro Gonzalez, not be allowed in the meeting and that there be no media
access.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter said it was ``unfortunate'' that the media and the Cuban exile
community already knew where the meeting was being held and begged that there be
no ``cameras, protests or circus'' outside.
</P>
<P>
	   The relatives in Elian's hometown of Cardenas, about a two-hour drive east
of Havana, said it was fine with them if the grandmothers met with other
relatives in Miami who reportedly support returning Elian to his father in Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Zapruders Donate JFK Film  </HEADLINE>
   By SHERRI CHUNN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DALLAS (AP) -- The last original duplicate of the home movie that captured
President Kennedy's assassination now belongs to a museum overlooking the famous
motorcade route.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials of the Sixth Floor Museum announced Wednesday that the family of
Abraham Zapruder agreed last month to donate the 26-second film and its
copyright, along with hundreds of related items, to the museum, which chronicles
Kennedy's life and death.
</P>
<P>
	   When Zapruder had the film processed after the assassination, he ordered
three so-called first-generation copies. The original film and two copies that
he gave to the Secret Service are stored at the National Archives. The third
copy was given to the museum.
</P>
<P>
	   The donation is the ``most important and most generous gift'' ever received
by the 11-year-old museum, said Andy Stern, chairman of the museum's board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
	   The museum occupies the sixth floor of the old Texas School Book Depository
building, where the Warren Commission said Lee Harvey Oswald positioned himself
to gun down the president.
</P>
<P>
	   Zapruder, a dressmaker who worked across the street from the book
depository, captured the assassination sequence, believed to be the only
complete visual record of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   The Assassination Records Review Board in 1997 declared the original film to
be the permanent possession of the people of the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, an arbitration panel ordered the U.S. government to pay
Zapruder's heirs $16 million plus interest for the original film.
</P>
<P>
	   The family announced their intention to transfer the copyright's ownership
to a public institution in August, after the arbitration panel reached its
ruling. If the government had assumed the copyright, the film could have fallen
into the public domain, meaning images from the film could have ended up on
coffee mugs, T-shirts and Websites.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Essentially, this establishes us as the official gatekeepers,'' said Jeff
West, the museum's executive director. ``The museum will serve as steward to
this remarkable national treasure, ensuring that it is adequately protected and
treated with a dignity that avoids exploitation.''
</P>
<P>
	   The copyright, which brings fees for public uses of the film's images in
documentaries or publications, earned about $879,000 for the family from 1976 to
1997, according to estimates made for the arbitration panel.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue generated from the copyright will go into the museum's general fund
and be used to pay for, among other things, the collection's preservation and
research.

<HEADLINE> Football? Feels Like Winter Olympics  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL NEWBERRY AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Hands shivering, Chris Sanders carefully lifted the
steaming, Styrofoam cup to his lips.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't even drink coffee," said the Tennessee Titans receiver, trying
futilely to get warm. "I am today."
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, this is the year they held the Super Bowl in Atlanta -- and the
Winter Olympics broke out.
</P>
<P>
	   The teams arrived Monday, shortly after an ice storm paralyzed much of the
metro area. That was followed by a jolt of unseasonably cold weather -- some 20
degrees below normal for this time of year in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   Making matters worse, Tennessee's media functions were held in a giant tent
outside the team's luxury hotel. Attempts at heating the temporary structure
were futile on a 26-degree morning, with a wind chill of minus 8.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought they would have heat in here," Titans tight end Larry Brown said,
huddled at a table with a hood covering his head. "Oh, man, it's freezing."
</P>
<P>
	   The St. Louis Rams were more fortunate. They met with reporters in a large
ballroom within their suburban hotel, prompting several players to show up in
short-sleeved T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
	   All-Pro tackle Orlando Pace winced when told of the Titans' arrangements.
This being the NFL, however, there was no room for pity.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm just happy we're in this cozy situation," Pace said.
</P>
<P>
	   Both teams, however, had to practice outside, the Titans at Georgia Tech,
the Rams at the Atlanta Falcons' complex in suburban Suwanee.
</P>
<P>
	   The only indoor facility in the area is the Georgia Dome, site of Sunday's
game. But the arena was set aside Wednesday and Thursday for rehearsing the
pre-game and halftime shows.
</P>
<P>
	   Temperatures were expected to climb above freezing on Thursday and the Dome
will be available the following day if conditions worsen, NFL spokesman Greg
Aiello said. The forecast called for possible snow -- that's right, snow.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's just an unfortunate circumstance that no one has any control over,"
Aiello said. "This is a very unusual weather pattern."
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans used up the ballroom space within their hotel for other team
functions, so the tent was set up in the parking lot, said Jim Steeg, vice
president of special events. The NFL has used similar arrangements at other --
albeit warmer, much warmer -- cities in recent years.
</P>
<P>
	   Steeg said 12 additional heaters will be brought in Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Back home, both teams have indoor practice facilities, but the Titans used
theirs only twice this season. Coach Jeff Fisher favors working outside on grass
and didn't seem too concerned by the cold weather.
</P>
<P>
	   Rams coach Dick Vermeil, on the other hand, said he preferred to practice
inside, but was informed by the league that it wasn't a possibility at the
Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
	   "All they told us," he said, "is there's 2,000 people decorating the dance
floor."
</P>
<P>
	   Spectacle over sport.
</P>
<P>
	   Titans quarterback Steve McNair, vapor rolling off his lips with every word,
wasn't looking forward to spending the rest of the week on a frozen practice
field.
</P>
<P>
	   "If it's this cold, I don't want to be outside," McNair said. "But it's
something we're going to have to deal with."
</P>
<P>
	   His teammates focused on getting warm. Good luck.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wish I had five jackets on, it's so cold out here," said Sanders, who
wore a flimsy jacket to the news conference in the tent. "It feels like Alaska."
</P>
<P>
	   Guard Jason Layman showed up in a short-sleeved T-shirt, then sat rigidly at
a table with his arms crossed, his hands clasping his bare elbows.
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps trying to determine if Layman was frozen, a teammate asked, "Why
aren't you wearing a jacket?"
</P>
<P>
	   Layman, slowly coming to life, replied, "I thought this was inside."
</P>
<P>
	   Defensive tackle Kenny Holmes went shopping Tuesday after hearing the
weather forecast, purchasing an insulated coat and matching pants. He was the
first player to arrive at the frigid tent and looked downright toasty in his new
duds.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a must have," Holmes said, looking like he was ready for a day on
the slopes. "I think I need to pick up another one."
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta officials don't think the frosty conditions will have a negative
impact on the city's chances of playing host to another Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   "The game is inside. Most of the events are inside. The hotels are inside,"
said Adam Leish, spokesman for the Metro Atlanta Super Bowl XXXIV Host
Committee. "The weather is not a factor from our perspective."
</P>
<P>
	   Of course, it must be noted that temperatures were much balmier Wednesday in
the next two Super Bowl cities: 53 in Tampa, 64 in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't want to bash Atlanta," Rams receiver Torry Holt said. "But I would
like to go somewhere where it's nice and warm."
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans, whose home has been Houston, Memphis and Nashville in the past
four years, weren't going to let anything ruin their first Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've been dealing with adversity, we've been dealing with all this other
junk for years," offensive lineman Brad Hopkins said. "Cold weather at the Super
Bowl is certainly not going to hinder us."

<HEADLINE> Smokers Seek Portion of Settlement  </HEADLINE>
    By RACHEL ZOLL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Lawyers for smokers are planning lawsuits against
eight states seeking a share of the $206 billion settlement of national
litigation against the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
	   The national litigation, which was settled in 1998, sought to recover money
that states spent treating smoking-related illnesses of those on the Medicaid
insurance program for the poor and disabled. However, many states plan to use
the money for projects totally unrelated to tobacco.
</P>
<P>
	   The new suits are being filed this week in Pennsylvania, Vermont, West
Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, and Rhode Island,
lawyers said. Some were filed Wednesday while others were delayed by winter
storms. Similar suits are pending in other states.
</P>
<P>
	   "It became crystal clear recently that states weren't going to do the right
thing. They're going to spend money on bridges and highways and not give any
money to the people on whose back they won the settlement," said Antonio
Ponvert, an attorney helping coordinate the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuits do not specify damages and Ponvert said it was impossible to
know exactly how much money was involved. But he said it likely is in the
"billions of dollars" nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Rhode Island Lt. Gov. Charles Fogarty, who has proposed dividing his state's
$56 million annual payment between anti-smoking campaigns and general health
care programs, said the national tobacco settlement was meant for a broader
purpose.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was not an attempt by the state at all to get money for individuals,"
Fogarty said. "This was an attempt to stop the tobacco companies from
perpetrating a fraud on people and help people break the cycle of addiction."
</P>
<P>
	   The national litigation alleged that tobacco companies made an addictive
product and sold it without properly warning the public.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawrence Tyler, 54, a former truck driver from Burlington, Vt., is among the
new plaintiffs. He smoked four or five packs a day for 43 years and now has
emphysema and can't work. He said he was angered by Vermont's debate over how to
spend the settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   "The tobacco companies, they made cigarettes addicting to people. Why should
the state get the money?" he said. "Why shouldn't we get a little something out
of it?"
</P>
<P>
	   The $206 billion settlement covers 46 states. The four remaining states
settled separately for an additional $40 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Conference of State Legislatures said only about 8 percent of
the first payments made in the settlement with the 46 states have been budgeted
for anti-smoking campaigns, with the remainder slated for general costs or to
cover losses from tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   The new suits hinge on a provision in Medicaid law which requires states to
pursue a party responsible for an injury. The money recovered would first go to
a state to cover its expenses, then to the federal government for its
contribution to Medicaid costs. The remainder would be given to anyone hurt by
the responsible party.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Congress waived its interest in any proceeds from the tobacco
settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   "It became plain as day when the federal government waived its right to get
any money back that there's money left," Vermont attorney Richard Cassidy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Billings of the American Lung Association in Washington, D.C., said he
couldn't comment directly on the lawsuits since he hadn't seen them. But he
criticized states for how they're spending the settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that states are squandering the opportunity the settlement offered
to reduce the horrendous toll that tobacco takes ... and reduce the future
Medicaid liability," Billings said.
</P>
<P>
	   Similar lawsuits previously were filed in California, Wisconsin and other
states. In the California case, a tentative ruling in state court indicates the
lawsuits have some merit, Ponvert said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Wisconsin, however, a federal court ruled the lawsuits violated the 11th
Amendment, which generally prohibits federal suits seeking monetary damages
against a state by citizens of the state or any other state. That ruling has
been appealed.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Long-term treasury bond prices rose on technical factors
Wednesday amid expectations that a further increase in interest rates by the
Federal Reserve might cool off the economy and reduce the risk of inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year note climbed  3/4 point, or $7.50 per $1,000 in
face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.57
percent from 6.63 percent late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Long-term yields now are lower than yields on five-year notes, a technical
indicator known as an inverted yield curve that could point to a slowing of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
	   It is widely expected that Fed inflation-fighters will vote next week to
raise interest rates for a fourth time since June. Rising inflation hurts bonds
and other investments that pay a fixed return.
</P>
<P>
	   In his Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan
didn't provide any clues on how the Fed will act, but once more pledged that the
central bank would keep inflation pressures from derailing the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices of short-term Treasury securities were unchanged, and intermediate
maturities rose 5/32 to 3/16 point, as reported Bridge Telerate, a financial
information service.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.57 percent as the discount rose
0.01 percentage point from Tuesday to 5.41 percent. Six-month yields were 5.76
percent, as the discount fell 0.01 percentage point to 5.52 percent. One-year
yields were 6.08 percent as the discount fell 0.01 percentage point to 5.74
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, rose
to 5.56 1/4 percent from Tuesday's 5.50 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bond Buyer index for municipal bonds rose 1/32 to 91 1/4 point. The
yield was 6.31 percent, unchanged from late Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Interview With MTV  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Al Gore said it was no ``great mystery'' why he chose to
smoke marijuana as a young man.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Bradley said he made a pilgrimage to Elvis Presley's home in Graceland
-- and saved a leaf from a tree there.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes said he stayed out of the counterculture in the 1960s. He was
at Princeton, where he started a business magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There were protests against the magazine that I was working on,'' Forbes
said. ``In that sense we were truly the counterculture.''
</P>
<P>
	   The presidential contenders talked about their younger years in MTV
interviews telecast Wednesday on a show called ``Where Were You at 22?''
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president said that he smoked marijuana while at Harvard University
in the late 1960s, while in the military and after he returned home, where it
``tapered off pretty quickly.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``That was a choice,'' he said. ``I wish I hadn't made it because I would
feel better about being able to say to all the people who are watching your
show, 'Don't do it' and 'I didn't do it.' But I did.''
</P>
<P>
	   Interviewer Chris Connelly asked Gore why he chose to smoke marijuana at the
time. Gore laughed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think that's a great mystery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although he was the son of a Tennessee senator and grew up in Washington,
Gore also said he was disillusioned about politics when he was 22.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was really thinking at that stage of my life that not only was politics
something that I wouldn't consider, I was certain it would be the absolute last
thing I ever did with my life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said that when he visited Graceland, Presley wasn't home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I climbed up the wall that surrounded Graceland, reached over to a limb
that was from a tree inside the wall, snapped the leaf off the tree and kept
that leaf in my wallet for about six years,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ben &AMP; Jerry's Net Income Up  </HEADLINE>
    By ROSS SNEYD AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade Inc. said a jump in the
company's fourth-quarter sales boosted profits above Wall Street's prediction.
</P>
<P>
	   But there was no word Wednesday on when or how the company's board of
directors would respond to offers to buy the company.
</P>
<P>
	   Earnings in the October-December period, excluding a restructuring charge
for eliminating the production of novelty products, totaled $1 million, or 14
cents a share, compared with $840,000, or 11 cents a share, a year earlier.
Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected fourth-quarter
earnings of 11 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Including the restructuring charge, the company reported a fourth-quarter
loss of $4.56 million, or 64 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales for the quarter were $51.68 million, up nearly 17 percent from $44.33
million a year earlier. The company credited increased sales in the United
Kingdom and higher sales of pints of ice cream in the United States for the
growth.
</P>
<P>
	   The special charge related to eliminating the production of novelty ice
cream products, such as chocolate-coated bars, at a company-owned plant in
Springfield, Vt. It plans to hire an outside company to produce its novelty
items.
</P>
<P>
	   In early afternoon, shares in Ben &AMP; Jerry's were unchanged at $22.50 on the
Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, net income excluding the special charge was $9 million, or
$1.21 a share, compared with $6.24 million, or 84 cents, in 1998. Including the
charge, earnings were $3.39 million, or 46 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales totaled $237 million, up 13 percent from $209.2 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Ben &AMP; Jerry's repeated its December announcement that it had received
"indications of interest" to acquire the company, but gave no clue how it might
respond.
</P>
<P>
	   "No decision has been made by the board with respect to any of these
indications of interest or as to any sale of the company," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Several coalitions of franchisees and customers have been formed to fight a
takeover.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Ben &AMP; Jerry's fell 6 1/4 cents to $21.87 1/2 in trading at 4 p.m.
on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel Interviews Greenspan  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alan Greenspan pledged that in a fourth term he would
promote greater openness at the traditionally secretive Federal Reserve as well
as pursue the central bank's traditional goal of keeping inflation pressures
from derailing the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing for his Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday, Greenspan also
repeated his strong preference that the soaring federal surpluses be used to
reduce the national debt rather than being diverted to tax cuts or higher
spending.
</P>
<P>
	   But Greenspan did lend support to a decision the Clinton administration has
made in its new budget to seek a boost in restrictive federal spending caps in
light of the rising surpluses.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan said he would prefer that the government adhere to the current
caps that were established as part of the 1997 balanced budget law. But he said
that increasing those limits slightly to allow more government spending on
discretionary programs was preferable to engaging in "spurious mechanisms to
evade them," as Congress has done in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan, held in almost as high regard in Congress as he is on Wall
Street, breezed through his Wednesday Senate confirmation hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the committee gave him a large share of the credit for America's
current good times with the lowest unemployment rates in three decades, low
inflation and an expansion that next month will set the all-time record for
longevity.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who chairs the Banking Committee, praised
Greenspan for "doing more than anyone else on the planet" to foster the current
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
	   Gramm said he hoped to have Greenspan's nomination voted out by his
committee next Tuesday and approved by the full Senate later in the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Wall Street, which had fallen sharply Monday on fears of what Greenspan
might say in his congressional testimony this week, took Wednesday's appearance
in stride. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 3.10 at 11032.99.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan did not directly comment on what the Fed's next move might be on
interest rates. Private economists widely believe that the central bank will
boost rates at its meeting next week by a quarter point, the fourth move since
last June to slow the surging economy to keep inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
	   Commenting on Greenspan's appearance, Mark Zandi, an economist at Regional
Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa., said, "There were no messages for the
markets. He came to express his general philosophy about monetary policy."
</P>
<P>
	   In his testimony before the committee, Greenspan promised to continue
efforts to allow the public greater insight into the decision-making process at
the traditionally secretive central bank.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have made considerable efforts in recent years to improve the
communication of our decisions, our expectations and their rationales to the
public," Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Starting in 1994, the Fed began releasing immediately announcements on
changes in interest rates and last week it promised to release a statement at
the end of every meeting revealing Fed thoughts on inflation dangers even if the
session does not result in a change in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Fed's primary goal to keep inflation low, Greenspan said, "Experience
has demonstrated that an essential ingredient in this prosperity, and an
ingredient for which the central bank has ultimate responsibility over the long
run, is low and stable inflation."
</P>
<P>
	   While not commenting directly on the Fed's next moves on interest rates,
Greenspan did agree with Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., that recent big increases
in the amount investors are borrowing to purchase stock, known as "buying on
margin," was worrisome.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan said that recent increases in margin borrowing to buy stock "have
caught our attention." But he said the central bank was not close to a decision
on changing its margin requirements that establish how much investors can borrow
to buy stocks. These borrowing limits, generally 50 percent of the purchase
price of a stock, have not been changed since 1974.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan, 73, was nominated earlier this month by President Clinton for a
fourth term as chairman of the Fed. He has headed the central bank since 1987
when Ronald Reagan selected him to succeed former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker. He
was renominated for a second term by George Bush in 1992 and by Clinton in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   It had been expected that Clinton would offer the Fed chairmanship to
Greenspan again, given that the Republican-controlled Senate was unlikely to
approve any other appointment by a Democratic president in his last year in
office.

<HEADLINE> Westchester guards accused of attacks on female inmates  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HAWTHORNE, N.Y. (AP) - Four veteran guards at the Westchester County
Jail were accused Wednesday of sexual attacks on female inmates, ranging from
rape and sodomy to stripping on demand.
<P>
	   "These acts are acts of intimidation, degradation, humiliation and serious
abuse," said District Attorney Jeanine Pirro.
</P>
<P>
	   County Executive Andrew Spano called the crimes "an abuse of power" and
announced that he was immediately banning male officers from the 10 posts inside
the women prisoners' living quarters, ending a bid-by-seniority system.
</P>
<P>
	   "These things are happening too often at the women's facility," he said at a
news conference at county police headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   The sex scandal broke one day after a correction sergeant was convicted of
covering up the fatal beating of a recovering heroin addict by guards at the
Nassau County Jail. Three other Nassau guards had already pleaded guilty in the
federal civil rights case and the Justice Department is investigating the jail.
</P>
<P>
	   The Westchester suspects were arrested Wednesday morning and taken to Mount
Pleasant Town Court for arraignment. Each was released on $3,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers were identified as:
</P>
<P>
	   -Carlos Aldarondo, 33, of Larchmont, a 12-year veteran, accused of statutory
rape and sodomy for allegedly engaging in intercourse and oral sex in the cell
of a 30-year-old prisoner.
</P>
<P>
	   -Javier Corona, 31, of Yonkers, accused of statutory rape for allegedly
taking a 32-year-old inmate into a supply closet for intercourse. He has been a
correction officer for nine years.
</P>
<P>
	   -Michael Downey, 39, of Millbrook, accused of official misconduct and sexual
abuse of three prisoners who said he directed them to expose private parts. He
has 12 years on the job.
</P>
<P>
	   -Robert Escalera, 39, another nine-year veteran, accused of official
misconduct for allegedly demanding that a 31-year-old inmate, who was suffering
from a toothache, reveal her sexual parts in exchange for Tylenol. Escalera, who
lives in Yonkers, is also accused of threatening the inmate after she spoke to
investigators.
</P>
<P>
	   The men were suspended with pay, but the pay will end within two days, said
Correction Commissioner Rocco Pozzi. If convicted, Aldarondo and Corona could be
sentenced to four years in prison. Downey and Escalera could get a year on each
count.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation began last year when an inmate complained about Downey.
Soon after, her boyfriend wrote to the county executive, the district attorney
and the Correction Department, to make sure her complaint was heard.
Investigators "came across information that seemed to indicate this was
widespread," Spano said.
</P>
<P>
	   A 1996 state law declares that even if sex between a guard and an inmate is
consensual, it is statutory rape because the inmate's subservient position makes
legal consent impossible.
</P>
<P>
	   "They have complete power and control over female inmates," Mrs. Pirro said.
"Inmates are reliant on correction officers for everything from protection to
food to safety to sanitary napkins."
</P>
<P>
	   She said half a dozen county jail officers have already been convicted on
similar sex charges, and "more inmates are coming forward."
</P>
<P>
	   The jail houses women who are either awaiting trial or serving sentences of
up to one year. On Wednesday there were 147 female inmates.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will prosecute sexual abuse charges whether the victim is accosted in
the street, in her home or in a criminal facility," Mrs. Pirro said.
</P>
<P>
	   Detective Glenna Lunn of the county police interviewed about 30 women, in
and out of prison, to find victims and witnesses. She said their solidarity,
especially considering the potential for retaliation, was impressive.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were very strong women," she said. "They should be proud of themselves
for coming forward."

<HEADLINE> Baby Suffocates on Pokemon Toy  </HEADLINE>
   By REX W. HUPPKE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A 4-month-old boy suffocated in his crib on a Burger
King Pokemon ball -- a toy that had been recalled nationally after a similar
death last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Zachary Jones was found dead Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's hard to believe that you go get the kids something to eat and you
bring home a lethal toy,'' said Michael Jones, the boy's grandfather.
</P>
<P>
	   The toy -- a hollow red-and-white plastic ball that is about the size of a
tennis ball and opens clamshell-style -- had been left in Zachary's crib by his
step-grandmother, said Deputy Police Chief Lana Schneider of suburban Lawrence.
She came back later to find the boy with half the ball covering his nose and
mouth, Schneider said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A 4-month-old baby cannot move things from their face, and basically it
suffocated,'' Schneider said.
</P>
<P>
	   The balls were given away by Burger King in children's meals, with a Pokemon
toy inside the sphere.
</P>
<P>
	   Burger King recalled millions of them Dec. 27, after a girl in Sonora,
Calif., suffocated in her playpen Dec. 11 with half a ball over her nose and
mouth.

	   Schneider said Zachary's family knew nothing of the recall.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We thought we were safe,'' said Sheila Jones, the boy's step-grandmother.
</P>
<P>
	   Burger King spokesman Charles Nicolas said the restaurant chain widely
publicized the recall, posting signs in restaurants, sending notices to
pediatricians and taking out a full-page ad in USA Today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In December we did publicize the safety hazard with the Poke balls,''
Nicolas said. ``We're exploring further options now that we can do to make
parents aware of this safety hazard for children under 3.''

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Co-Chair To Retire  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Robert Eaton, the former
Chrysler chairman and CEO who helped orchestrate one of the largest industrial
mergers ever with Daimler-Benz AG, will retire from the company March 31.
</P>
<P>
	   Eaton, 59, gave the announcement to a meeting of senior managers Wednesday,
saying that "this is the right time for me to go."
</P>
<P>
	   "This of course should be no surprise to anyone. I've said from the very
beginning that when this merger is complete, I would be retiring. The time is
now."
</P>
<P>
	   When Chrysler was acquired by Daimler-Benz AG in 1998, Eaton said he would
share the job of chairman with Daimler-Benz head Juergen Schrempp for no more
than three years, then retire. Eaton had said he would retire earlier if the
major hurdles of the merger were completed.
</P>
<P>
	   While the marriage was originally billed as a merger of equals -- with
headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany and Auburn Hills, Mich. -- DaimlerChrysler
has become a German-American company with the emphasis on German. Most of its
stock is held in Germany; the company is incorporated under German business
laws, and a majority of its upper managers come from the Daimler-Benz side.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite Germany's dominance, the divisions run their businesses with little
interference from across the Atlantic. Chrysler's culture has changed little
since the merger, and still accounts for nearly half of the merged company's
profits and revenues.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's been clear for some time that the Germans have been in the
power position," said David Cole, the head of the University of Michigan's
Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation. "But it's also clear they are
not tampering with the profitable Chrysler side."
</P>
<P>
	   Eaton, a mechanical engineer, joined Chrysler in 1992 after a 29-year career
at General Motors Corp. Eaton had worked in a variety of jobs at GM, including
running GM's European operations, before joining Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
	   Eaton was promoted to chairman and chief executive officer on Jan. 1, 1993,
replacing Lee Iacocca. During his tenure, Chrysler reworked itself from the
weakest of the Big Three automakers into a highly profitable company.
</P>
<P>
	   But Eaton also came to believe that Chrysler could not face the future
alone, that only a handful of automakers could survive and compete globally.
</P>
<P>
	   "We recognized we weren't going to be able to grow as a single company
internationally as we felt was necessary. We felt it was a tremendous
opportunity for Chrysler," Eaton said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   He and Schrempp began talking about a possible combination at the 1998
Detroit auto show, and announced the $32.8 billion deal five months later.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are leading a new trend we believe will change the future, the face of
the industry," Eaton said when the deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
	   The two leaders acknowledged the merger wouldn't be easy. Their own study of
transnational mergers suggests that 70 percent failed to achieve the kind of
success that had been anticipated.
</P>
<P>
	   The resulting company -- named DaimlerChrysler after a long series of
negotiations -- not only makes cars, but commercial trucks, trains and rockets
as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the merger, several top Chrysler executives have left, including its
highly regarded president, Thomas Stallkamp, who had been mentioned as a
possible successor to Eaton.
</P>
<P>
	   DaimlerChrysler's stock price has slowly fallen from its post-merger highs,
when it was above $100 a share; shares of DaimlerChrysler were trading down 81
1/4 cents to $67.18 3/4 at 5:15 p.m. EST on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   And there have been concerns that the freewheeling spirit of Chrysler was a
poor fit with the regimental view of Daimler. Eaton worked hard to sell the
merger to employees and shareholders, and to ease concerns about culture
clashes.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think you'll ever end up with one culture," he said Wednesday. "We
want to have the culture of wherever we work around the world. I feel very good
about the synergies we've produced so far."
</P>
<P>
	   University of Michigan's Cole said it was too early to pass judgment on the
success of the merger, since the company has had few high-profile opportunities
to collaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   "They probably oversold the level of synergies and the potential for cost
savings," Cole said. "There was no real overlap in products -- they filled in
each other's blank spaces."
</P>
<P>
	   As recently as this year's Detroit auto show, Eaton said in an interview
there was "no new news to report" about his status with the company. Eaton said
Wednesday he decided last week to retire.
</P>
<P>
	   "This has just been a great year," Eaton said. "We have the structure in
place now, we have the leadership in place ... we've got an incredible
portfolio, and the pipeline is absolutely full of product."
</P>
<P>
	   When Eaton retires, Schrempp will become the sole chairman of
DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every achievement of this company in the future will bear a portion of
Bob's legacy of leadership and vision," Schrempp said in a statement. "Bob
Eaton's dedication and role in the transition made DaimlerChrysler possible, and
has been a key to its success."

<HEADLINE> Philip Morris' Earnings Push Higher  </HEADLINE>
    By SKIP WOLLENBERG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Philip Morris Cos. Inc.'s profit edged up 2.7 percent in
the fourth quarter as higher prices boosted results from its industry-leading
U.S. tobacco business even though it sold fewer cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
	   The maker of the top-selling Marlboro brand also reported improved
performances from its Kraft food business and its Miller Brewing unit.
</P>
<P>
	   But the results Wednesday were slightly below Wall Street expectations, and
Philip Morris shares skidded almost 2 percent, or by 43 3/4 cents a share, to
$21.87 1/2 in trading at 5:15 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   The drop on Wall Street may reflect investors' lingering concerns about the
industry's exposure to lawsuits by smokers and the federal government, and
wariness about possible new federal initiatives to discourage smoking, said
Martin Feldman, who follows tobacco stocks for Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
	   "This has nothing to with the earnings results whatsoever," Feldman said.
"If anything, the details suggest improving trends in its tobacco and
international operations."
</P>
<P>
	   Before one-time factors, Philip Morris earned $1.81 billion, or 77 cents a
share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, up from $1.77 billion, or 72 cents a
share, a year earlier, when there were unusual charges for settling tobacco
lawsuits with the states.
</P>
<P>
	   Philip Morris said its food and tobacco businesses generated $225 million in
added revenue and $100 million in extra income in the fourth quarter because
people who stocked up in advance of the new year on fears that there may be Y2K
problems. It said there will be a corresponding reduction in the first quarter
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Pretax charges totaling $2.4 billion, mostly for the industry settlement of
suits by the states for the costs of treating sick smokers, had reduced Philip
Morris' net earnings to $274 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue rose 4.4 percent to $19.2 billion from $18.4 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest results were a penny less than the 78 cents a share that analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial expected.
</P>
<P>
	   Chairman Geoffrey C. Bible said "our business fundamentals finished the year
in good shape and we enter 2000 with strong momentum across all of our operating
companies."
</P>
<P>
	   Earnings from the domestic tobacco business was up 1.1 percent to $1.4
billion in the quarter even though Philip Morris sold 4.1 percent fewer
cigarettes. Earnings rose because of record price hikes totaling 63 cents a pack
imposed since November 1998 largely to help defray the costs of the legal
settlement with the states.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite selling fewer cigarettes, Philip Morris finished the year with a
bigger share of the U.S. tobacco market.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said its shipments dropped 8.5 percent for the year but that
industry shipments were off 9 percent. Philip Morris cited independent estimates
that its brands accounted for a record 49.9 percent of U.S. cigarette sales in
1999, up 0.5 percentage point from a year earlier. Marlboro alone accounted for
36 percent of U.S. sales, up 1.6 points, the estimates said.
</P>
<P>
	   International tobacco earnings were up 0.2 percent for the quarter despite
shipping 3.1 percent fewer cigarettes. Higher prices helped.
</P>
<P>
	   Profits from the Kraft Foods business rose 6 percent in North America and
1.8 percent elsewhere for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Miller Brewing's profits rose 83 percent in the quarter because of higher
prices, the company's increased work under contract with other brewers and
recently acquired brands from Stroh and Pabst.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, Philip Morris earned $7.7 billion, or $3.19 a share, up from
$5.37 billion, or $2.20 a share, in 1998. Revenue rose 5.7 percent to $78.6
billion from $74.4 billion.

<HEADLINE> Torricelli Rejects Stock Criticism  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ARNOLD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Robert Torricelli denied suggestions he got
preferential treatment on a stock deal in which a $5,000 investment quickly grew
to be worth $220,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The New Jersey Democrat, whose personal financial dealings have come under
scrutiny before, said Wednesday his investment in e.Volve Technology Group Inc.
was no sweetheart deal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The company was near bankruptcy,'' said Torricelli, D-N.J. ``They couldn't
find anybody who wanted to invest.''
</P>
<P>
	   Torricelli last year was one of 15 people invited to buy shares of e.Volve,
a new company involved in several Internet ventures. He paid $5,000 for two
shares.
</P>
<P>
	   Steven Loglisci, the chief executive of e.Volve, formerly was Torricelli's
financial adviser. He said he turned to Torricelli and other longtime friends
for money to keep his company afloat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He did me a favor,'' Loglisci said. ``At the time when Bob made his
investment, we were still testing the equipment. We didn't even know if it would
work.''
</P>
<P>
	   When another Internet company, eVentures Group, bought e.Volve, Torricelli
ended up with 8,333 shares of eVentures stock, which were trading Wednesday at
about $26 apiece on the Nasdaq stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Under terms of the offering, Torricelli cannot sell his shares until Sept.
21, 2001, so his profit only is on paper.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Ruskin of the Congressional Accountability Project said such deals
``have the strong appearance of a gift when a member of Congress is given a very
generous private investment.''
</P>
<P>
	   Torricelli called that characterization ``completely irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
	   Torricelli, in his first term in the Senate, has become a leading
fund-raiser and spokesman for the Democratic Party. His aggressive brand of
politics is mirrored in the way he handles his personal finances: He seeks out
high-risk investments because of the potentially big returns.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I actually believe I'm a better United States senator because I understand
the economy, I participate, and I make some of these investments,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1994, he made $144,000 after getting an insider's price on an initial
public offering for the First Savings Bank of Perth Amboy in New Jersey. He
subsequently acknowledged ``public debate and concern about the fairness'' of
such deals. He placed his holdings in a blind trust and said he would not
personally invest in the market.
</P>
<P>
	   Unhappy with its performance, Torricelli abandoned the blind trust in 1998
and resumed investing for himself.

<HEADLINE> NJ Woman Pregnant With Septuplets  </HEADLINE>
   By WAYNE PARRY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEPTUNE, N.J. (AP) -- When their daughter died in infancy two years ago,
Ivette Zapata-Smalls and her husband, Fred, raged against God, demanding to know
why when so many evil people flourish.
</P>
<P>
	   But now they see the hand of God in her latest pregnancy. In late March, if
all goes as hoped, she'll become one of only a handful of women in the world to
give birth to seven babies at once.
</P>
<P>
	   Their strong Christian faith led them to reject the advice of doctors who
said aborting as many as four or five of the fetuses would improve the chances
for the others. They said after the death of their 21-month-old daughter, Anisa,
from rheumatoid arthritis in 1998, there could be no thought of losing another
child.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We fought for her life,'' Ms. Zapata-Smalls said Wednesday. ``We said,
`How can you fight for one life and then kill any life after that?' ... We're
both against abortion, and we just couldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The couple had been trying without success to have another child before
Anisa's death. Ms. Zapata-Smalls began taking Clomid, a fertility drug that
stimulates the production of eggs in the ovaries, but it didn't work. Then a
doctor switched her to a stronger drug called Pergonal and she underwent an
insemination.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Zapata-Smalls, 31, is now in her 20th week pregnancy, confined to bed
rest at Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune. She is to remain there until
late March, when the fetuses will have reached 28 or 29 weeks. At that point,
she is to deliver them by Caesarean section.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, she and the fetuses are doing well, according to her obstetrician,
Dr. Charles Hux.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But we've got a long way to go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple is aware of the risks of proceeding with multiple deliveries. Ms.
Zapata-Smalls has already had a kidney stone and two episodes of blood clots
caused by her oversized uterus pressing on blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, all seven babies are growing normally. If the pregnancy can be
extended to 28 or 29 weeks, there is about a 75 percent chance that all seven
babies can survive, although some might be born with medical complications that
can't be foreseen, Hux said.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, doctors know Ms. Zapata-Smalls is carrying three girls and two boys.
The sex of the other two can't yet be determined.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple's four-bedroom home, which once seemed so spacious, now seems a
lot smaller. A nursery planned for one baby will now have to be greatly
expanded.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not unrealistic,'' Ms. Zapata-Smalls said. ``We know we're going to
need a lot of help. We're going to rely on people's hearts.''

<HEADLINE> Investor Borrowing Concerns Fed  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said Wednesday the central
bank is worried about recent high levels of borrowing by investors to buy stocks
and has been studying the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Federal Reserve is reluctant to exercise its authority to tighten
limits on such borrowing, a practice known as buying on margin, he told the
Senate Banking Committee during his nomination hearing. Studies have suggested
that a rising level of stock prices is unrelated to liberal margin requirements,
Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors buy securities on margin by borrowing part of the purchase price
from their brokerage firm and putting up the securities as collateral for the
loan.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have been reluctant to move margin requirements which clearly would have
no effect on large investors" who can get credit to trade stocks in other ways,
Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed has not changed margin requirements, which generally limit borrowing
to 50 percent of a stock's purchase price, since 1974. Brokerage firms are
allowed to set limits higher than 50 percent for their customers but they cannot
make them lower.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan acknowledged, though, that upward spikes in margin levels in
November and December that were cited at the hearing by Sen. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y., had caught the Fed's attention and were under study.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can't say where this particular endeavor on our part is going to come
out," Greenspan said. When Schumer asked whether the Fed was worried about the
apparent trend, he answered, "Obviously, we are. ... If we were not worried we
would not be studying it."
</P>
<P>
	   Schumer said some people active on Wall Street had told him they "are truly
troubled by this."
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Bove, senior vice president for research at brokerage firm Raymond
James Financial, said that if the Fed were to increase margin requirements, "it
would have a devastating impact" on stock prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors would be forced to scramble to come up with more cash and the
market would suffer as a result, Bove said in a telephone interview from St.
Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   Last April, the brokers' group that operates the Nasdaq Stock Market warned
investors about excessive use of margin borrowing as swings in the market were
becoming a regular occurrence.
</P>
<P>
	   The risks of buying on margin increase in tandem with the volatility of the
markets, said NASD Regulation, the self-policing arm of the National Association
of Securities Dealers.

<HEADLINE> Women caught under state's drug laws freed after years in prison  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Lisa Oberg couldn't stop touching her mother - hugging
her, kissing her, grabbing her hand. And for the first time in her 11-year life,
she didn't have to.
<P>
	   Gone were the days of sporadic visits with Arlene Oberg, who had been
serving a 15-year-to-life prison sentence for a 1988 drug arrest and subsequent
conviction. No more motherhood by correspondence, through letters and phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Oberg and two other women were freed from the Bedford Hills
Correctional Facility after winning clemency from Gov. George Pataki last month.
</P>
<P>
	   "I felt so happy. She looked so pretty," said Lisa, who was born on Rikers
Island months after her mother was arrested. She has been raised by her
grandmother in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
	   "This means my life could start to be normal, because I've never had a
normal life," Lisa said. "My mother's here and I don't have to lie about where
she is anymore."
</P>
<P>
	   Oberg, Elaine Bartlett, and Jan Warren had all been sentenced under the
state's controversial Rockefeller drug law, which requires sentences of at least
15 years to life for possession of even relatively small amounts of hard drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Oberg, 33, had been arrested in 1988 after assisting in four cocaine sales.
The last one was for eight ounces of the drug.
</P>
<P>
	   "It doesn't work," she said of the Rockefeller law. "You have too many
people who have minimal roles, and the people who are making the profit and
stand to make the most gain are out there, business as usual."
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of the law, named for former Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, note that
it's the nation's harshest penalty for drug use or possession. They have called
repeatedly for lawmakers to reconsider it.
</P>
<P>
	   Advocates for easing the penalties include the state's chief judge, Judith
Kaye; Cardinal John O'Connor and the state's Roman Catholic bishops; and a
coalition which includes some of the same state legislators who voted in 1973 to
institute the statutes. Even Laurence Rockefeller has come out in favor of
reform, saying his brother would have recognized the inequities and failures of
the law had he lived long enough.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the most unjust law enacted in the Legislature in my time," said
Jerome W. Marks, a retired Supreme Court judge. He said the law excessively
punishes those involved in the lower levels of the drug trade, rather than those
who make the money and direct the flow of illegal substances.
</P>
<P>
	   While the law's effect on drug trafficking is debatable, one thing is sure:
it has significantly contributed to the surge in New York's prison population.
In 1973, there were 14,700 inmates in 18 state prisons; in 1999, there were more
than 70,000 inmates in 70 prisons. About one-third were jailed on drug crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Bartlett, one of the two women released along with Oberg, was sentenced to
20 years to life in prison after being arrested as a 26-year-old for bringing
four ounces of cocaine to Albany. She is now 42, and the drug possession charge
was her first offense.
</P>
<P>
	   The mother of four said she had never even gotten a parking ticket before,
but her good record had no impact on her sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Rockefeller drug laws are ridiculous," she said. "People are rotting
away in jail for nothing."
</P>
<P>
	   Her son, Apache, 22, agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   "You don't have to be a person with a soft heart to see that you don't do 20
to life for a first-time offense, and for a small amount of drugs," he said.
"Let the judges do their jobs."

<HEADLINE> US Woman Ends Prison Hunger Strike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- An American woman serving a life sentence for treason has
ended a 15-day hunger strike started to protest her imprisonment, her family
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lori Berenson, a New York state native and former Massachusetts Institute of
Technology student, was convicted by a secret military court in 1996 for helping
rebels with the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement plan a thwarted
attack on Peru's Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   On Jan. 11, the fourth anniversary of her conviction, Berenson, 30, stopped
eating solid food.
</P>
<P>
	   Berenson ended the hunger strike Tuesday morning, her mother, Rhoda
Berenson, said Wednesday from New York. ``As far as we know, she is doing
okay.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said the U.S. Embassy informed the family that doctors had checked her
daughter ``and that there seemed to be no problem.''
</P>
<P>
	   Berenson's parents have carried out a campaign to free their daughter. But
President Alberto Fujimori has said she is a terrorist and will serve her full
sentence in Peruvian prisons.
</P>
<P>
	   Berenson, who was convicted by a military court, has said that she was not
allowed to present evidence at her trial or to question prosecution witnesses
and that the judge wore a hood.
</P>
<P>
	   Her parents denied that their daughter had attached any specific demands to
ending her hunger strike.
</P>
<P>
	   In a handwritten letter relayed to the family by U.S. Embassy officials,
Berenson had written that she was refusing food ``as a protest to show my
rejection of the social injustice, the violation of human dignity and my
rejection of how life is lived in prison.''
</P>
<P>
	   Peruvian authorities described the protest as a pressure tactic to force a
transfer back to Yanamayo prison, a high-security jail for leftist rebel
leaders, where inmates live under harsh conditions but have more freedom to
socialize.
</P>
<P>
	   In October 1998, Berenson, was transferred from frigid Yanamayo prison,
12,700 feet above sea level, to the lower-lying Socabaya prison, 465 miles
southeast of Lima, for health reasons.

more contact with other prisoners in Yanamayo. She requested last July to be
returned to Yanamayo.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 3.10; Nasdaq Down 97.47  </HEADLINE>
    By DUNSTAN PRIAL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices closed mostly lower Wednesday as cautious
investors, fearing a pending interest rate hike, fled the technology sector
despite strong corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell sharply, losing 97.50 to
close at 4,069.91. The Dow Jones industrial average, well into positive
territory for most of the session, survived a late selloff to close up 3.10 at
11,032.99.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 5.94 to 1,404.09.
</P>
<P>
	   "We saw a fairly big decline in the technology sector. It had been showing
signs of cracking, and it really kind of came unglued today," said Ricky
Harrington, a technical analyst with Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   The selloff occurred despite strong earnings reports. But several well-known
technology companies were punished for not living up to investors' extraordinary
expectations for the sector.
</P>
<P>
	   A case in point was cellular phone chipmaker Qualcomm, which closed down 24
3/8 at 124 5/8. Despite beating analysts' earnings estimates by a penny, the
company warned Tuesday that sales may be off this quarter. Investors promptly
punished the company, driving the stock down nearly 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   And software maker and network storage company EMC Corp. fell despite
reporting fourth-quarter earnings of 34 cents a share, excluding a one-time
charge related to an acquisition. The figure beat Wall Street analysts'
estimates of 31 cents a share but the company reported lower-than-expected
revenues for an important segment of its business, causing investors to flee.
EMC was trading down 7 1/2 at 111 in after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
	   Market watchers said congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Alan Greenspan gave investors few signals about the direction Fed
policy makers are likely to take when they meet to discuss interest rates next
week.
</P>
<P>
	   "Investors were cautious in anticipation of Greenspan's testimony, which
might have given them an indication of where interest rates are going. But he
didn't say anything investors could latch on to one way or the other," said Paul
McEnroe, a trader at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The financial services sector was up across the board in the wake of strong
earnings following a booming fourth quarter on Wall Street. Dow Jones industrial
average member J.P. Morgan closed up 7 3/16 at 123 3/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Brokerage firms were also rewarded Wednesday. Merrill Lynch traded up 6 at
87 in after hours trading, and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter rose 3 7/16 at 132
7/8.
</P>
<P>
	   McEnroe said it appeared as if some investors were rotating money out of
newer technology stocks into more established companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the stocks benefiting from that trend were Corning, which rose 4 3/4
to 156, and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, up 4 15/16 at 96 5/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said President Clinton's State of the Union address, slated for
Thursday, was also making investors cautious.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 1.35 billion shares, compared with 1.29
billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.55 to 521.04.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.1 percent. European indexes
also saw increases, with Germany's Xetra DAX index up 2.3 percent, Britain's
FT-SE 100 up 1.6 percent, and France's CAC-40 up 0.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> New N.H. Polls Give Gore the Edge  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore got an apparent bump in one New Hampshire poll
from his big win in Iowa's caucuses, while another state survey suggested George
W. Bush has lost ground among conservatives in the last couple of months.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was locked in a close race with Bradley in New Hampshire in a Boston
Globe-WBZ-TV tracking poll right before the caucuses, but his improved showing
the night after the caucuses gave him a slight, 48 percent to 42 percent edge.
</P>
<P>
	   Numerous other polls taken right before the caucuses indicated Vice
President Gore had an edge even then over Bradley, a former senator from New
Jersey. Tracking polls released Wednesday by CNN-USA Today-Gallup and the
University of New Hampshire-WMUR-Fox also showed Gore with a slim lead over
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Republican side, a New Hampshire poll taken by RKM Research and
Communications for the Boston Herald and WCVB-TV has suggested that publisher
Steve Forbes and talk show host Alan Keyes have gained ground among
conservatives since December. That's apparently at Bush's expense, pollster R.
Kelly Myers said.
</P>
<P>
	   While Arizona Sen. John McCain has stayed at about 32 percent since
December, Bush has slipped from 34 percent to 27 percent, meaning the two are in
a statistical tie given the poll's 5-percentage-point error margin. Forbes had
16 percent in the latest poll, compared with 11 percent in December -- a change
just within the error margin. Keyes was at 4 percent in December and is now at
11 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also had a small lead over Bush in the new tracking polls by CNN-USA
Today-Gallup and UNH-Fox-WMUR.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The traditional, conservative Republican voters originally lined up with
Bush,'' Myers said. ``In the last month, what we've seen is that both Forbes and
Keyes are eating into Bush's base of support, Forbes taking the fiscal
conservatives and Keyes taking the social conservatives.''
</P>
<P>
	   While the margins are small, Myers said he's seen a consistent movement
among these groups.
</P>
<P>
	   Among Democrats, Al Gore was at 46 percent and Bill Bradley was at 40
percent in the latest RKM poll. Two weeks ago, Bradley was ahead of Gore, 44-38.
Myers said it was impossible to tell how much of that shift came before the
caucuses or after.
</P>
<P>
	   The telephone poll for the Herald and WCVB was conducted Monday and Tuesday
after the Iowa caucuses, which Bush won on the Republican side and Gore won
among Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   A Boston Globe-WBZ poll taken Monday and Tuesday gave McCain 37 percent to
Bush's 35 percent, also a statistical tie. That poll, taken by KRC Research of
400 likely voters each in the Democrat and Republican primaries, also had an
error margin of plus or minus 5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   The Herald-WCVB poll found that one out of five likely voters in the
Democratic primary are concerned about Bradley's health. Bradley disclosed
earlier in the campaign that he had an irregular heartbeat, a condition for
which he takes medication. He said last week that he has had four recent
episodes, but insisted his health is not a concern.
</P>
<P>
	   Five percent of Democrats polled said they are ``very concerned'' that
Bradley's health could affect his ability to be president and 17 percent said
they are ``somewhat concerned.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Alan Keyes didn't miss a beat when a couple of
questions came at him Wednesday -- in French.
</P>
<P>
	   Marcel Calfat of Radio-Canada, the French service of the Canadian
Broadcasting Corp., had read that Keyes could speak French. ``You never know
what they put in those bios,'' he said. ``I wanted to check it out.''
</P>
<P>
	   Calfat asked Keyes, a former U.S. representative to a United Nations
committee, about the North American Free Trade Agreement. Keyes, in French, said
he isn't opposed to it in principle, but that it may need to be re-evaluated.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes answered another question in French about the message he wants to send
to New Hampshire voters. ``The message is very simple. I represent moral
priorities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How many languages can you do that in?'' another reporter asked.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What I just did I can probably only do in French,'' Keyes said. ``I would
have broken down much sooner in Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
	   How well did Keyes do?
</P>
<P>
	   ``A lot more articulate, in fact, than some Canadian politicians,'' Calfat
said. French and English are the official languages of Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   The reporter said he hasn't had a chance to check out the other candidates.
``But Bradley's wife is supposed to speak French,'' he said. ``She's my next
victim.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   The candidates were far from the only ones with their competitive juices
flowing before the Wednesday night debates.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Williams, a Texan helping John McCain, said he and another volunteer
showed up outside the WMUR-TV studio at 5 a.m. to begin putting up more than 400
signs. Steve Forbes' volunteers arrived three hours later.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It looked really nice until the Forbes people got here,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
	   By late afternoon, the crowd of competing volunteers and onlookers had
swelled to roughly 400.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   A man wearing a pot on his head was among those trying to make a point
outside the studio.
</P>
<P>
	   Andrew Spannaus, 28, of Leesburg, Va., was holding a sign that read ``Pot
Heads for Gore.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're protesting the fact that Gore has smoked marijuana,'' he said.
``What kind of president would that make?''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore also was the target of two men farther up the long line of signs and
supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Justin Bonner, 20, and Brian McHugh, 19, have been following Gore around
this weak wearing maroon and saffron robes and flesh-colored skull caps. They
carried a briefcase labeled, ``Al Gore Finance Committee,'' to criticize Gore's
1996 fund-raising at a Buddhist temple.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the proposals were familiar -- a flat tax, universal health care,
getting rid of pork-barrel legislation, a ban on late-term abortions. But the
names at this debate didn't ring many bells.
</P>
<P>
	   The New Hampshire Historical Society held a forum in Concord on Wednesday
for candidates on the ballot who weren't invited to the nationally televised
debates that night. Eight presidential hopefuls who had shelled out $1,000 to
get on the ballot used their brief time in the spotlight to voice their
concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   Heather Harder of Crown Point, Ind., said she first ran for president 10
years ago because she was disgusted by what she saw in politics. She wants laws
to be written simply so people can understand them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No more hidey holes,'' she said. ``No more smoke and mirrors.''
</P>
<P>
	   A 39-year-old housepainter from Baltimore who has changed his legal name to
Vermin Supreme showed up, but wasn't allowed on the stage because he isn't on
the ballot. Supreme wore a large black rubber boot on his head and flippers as
epaulets.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he's running on a platform of ``mandatory tooth-brushing,'' but his
brochure describes him as ``the friendly fascist, a tyrant you can trust.''

<HEADLINE> Farmers Seek Genetic Crop Controls  </HEADLINE>
   By MATT CRENSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTREAL (AP) -- Environment ministers from about 50 countries arrived in
Montreal Wednesday to negotiate a set of rules that would protect the
environment from dangers posed by genetically engineered plants, animals and
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
	   Small-scale farmers from around the world also came to Montreal to ask for
regulations limiting what they call ``genetic pollution'' -- genetically
modified crops spreading their altered genes into the environment around them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The problem is totally out of control,'' said Canadian farmer Hart Haiden.
</P>
<P>
	   This is the second time the United Nations has attempted to facilitate the
agreement, known as the Biosafety Protocol. The last effort, which took place
almost a year ago in Cartagena, Colombia, ended in deadlock when a group led by
the United States refused to sign a draft agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   The president of the conference, Juan Mayr, said the presence of high-level
officials at this week's talks is a sign that a protocol likely will be signed.
U.S. delegates said that Undersecretary of State Frank Loy was arriving
Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At this time we have 50 ministers here in Montreal. In Cartagena, I was
the only one,'' said Mayr, who is also Colombia's environment minister.
</P>
<P>
	   Since informal talks in Montreal began on Monday, much of the discussion has
centered on how international trade in genetically engineered crops such as
corn, wheat and cotton should be conducted.
</P>
<P>
	   While the United States and other major agricultural exporters are calling
for relatively free trade, a coalition of developing nations wants countries to
be allowed to say no to imports of the crops.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are strongly supportive of a Biosafety Protocol that protects the
environment without disrupting world food trade,'' said David Sandalow, the
chief U.S. delegate.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said those at the meeting are discussing a compromise that would
create a biosafety agency to inform countries of the risks posed by genetically
modified organisms. Countries could then decide whether to allow imports of
specific crops.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmentalists and some farmers complain that it is already too late.
About 70 million acres were planted with genetically modified crops in 1999, and
in many cases they already spreading their genes to unaltered varieties.
</P>
<P>
	   Haiden said that in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan,
genes from genetically engineered canola plants have already spread to unaltered
varieties. And because European countries may ban imports of genetically
engineered canola, that may shut Canada out of a major market.
</P>
<P>
	   Organic farmers are especially concerned because plants are very efficient
at spreading genetic information. Honeybees can carry canola pollen up to five
miles, and under some conditions wind can blow tree pollen dozens of miles.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The problem is that genetic pollution can't be contained, or even cleaned
up afterwards,'' said Steve Gilman, an organic farmer in Stillwater, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   He charged that Bt corn, a variety genetically engineered to produce a
natural insecticide, will cause irreparable harm to organic farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   Organic farmers use Bt because it is produced by a natural bacterium. But if
Bt corn spreads it more widely in the environment, Gilman worries that pests
will build up resistance, just as they have to some chemical insecticides.

<HEADLINE> France Telecom Is Global One Owner  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PARIS (AP) -- France Telecom SA said Wednesday it reached deals worth more
than $4 billion in cash and debts to buy out partners Sprint Corp. and Deutsche
Telekom AG and become the sole owner of Global One.
</P>
<P>
	   The French, state-owned telecommunications company said it would purchase
the German and American companies' stakes in the troubled four-year-old joint
venture for a combined $3.88 billion in cash and $464.5 million in debts.
</P>
<P>
	   The three partners had been planning to reshuffle the shareholding structure
of Global One after relations soured between Deutsche Telekom and France
Telecom, and Sprint opted for a merger with MCI-Worldcom Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   France Telecom estimated Global One's value at $5.9 billion although the
joint venture reported after-tax losses of $723 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The partnership was originally launched to provide voice, data and Internet
service to Fortune 500 companies in their international operations. It has a
presence in 65 countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Sprint's exit from the venture had been expected since the company agreed in
October to combine with MCI WorldCom Inc., in a $115 billion deal.
</P>
<P>
	   In May, Deutsche Telekom made an ill-fated attempt to merge with Telecom
Italia -- which led to a break in partnership talks with France Telecom and has
ignited a telecommunications feud between the two firms.
</P>
<P>
	   Last October, France Telecom established a presence in the valuable German
telecommunications market by purchasing a majority stake in the E-Plus mobile
telephone network.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutche Telekom, owned by the German government, earlier this month
expressed interest in purchasing Global One.

<HEADLINE> Grandmothers, Elian Reunited  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez was finally reunited with his
grandmothers Wednesday at a ``neutral site'' that had to be arranged by the U.S.
government because of the personal and political passions swirling around the
6-year-old Cuban boy.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was driven to a nun's house in Miami Beach to see his grandmothers,
who had flown in from Washington and were then brought to the home in a
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers came to the United States last week to appeal to the
American people and Congress to send the boy back to his father in Cuba. Elian's
relatives in Miami want him to stay and are fighting a U.S. government order
sending him back.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers were to see Elian privately, with the boy's Florida
relatives nearby in the house. Elian's father, in a letter printed in the
Communist Party newspaper Granma, asked to be included in the reunion by
telephone.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Department spokeswoman Carole Florman said the women would not be
allowed to take the boy home with them afterward. A lawyer for Elian's
relatives, Spencer Eig, said the visit was expected to last two hours.
</P>
<P>
	   A few people tossed flowers at the car that took the women from the
helicopter to the house, where about 200 demonstrators waited outside. Some
cheered and others booed as the grandmothers were driven by.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers had also flown to Miami on Monday but left town without
seeing Elian. The Miami relatives insisted that any reunion take place at their
home in the Little Havana neighborhood, but the grandmothers said they were
uncomfortable going there. Anti-Castro Cuban immigrants have been holding
protests around the home.
</P>
<P>
	   After long negotiations, the Justice Department ordered Elian's relatives to
bring him to the nun's house. The agency said it had the authority to do so
under the arrangement letting the boy stay in this country pending further
immigration proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   Mariela Quintana and Raquel Rodriguez had not seen their grandson since
before he left Cuba for the United States with his mother, who died along with
10 other people when their boat capsized. Elian was found clinging to an inner
tube off the Florida coast on Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
	   The reunion was held at the home of Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, president of
Barry University. O'Laughlin, 70, has a history of helping immigrants and had
said she would serve as ``welcomer'' and ``hugger.''
</P>
<P>
	   George Fowler, a lawyer for the Cuban American National Foundation,
confirmed that the meeting had begun. No further details were available.
</P>
<P>
	   On Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott indicated he has no solid
plans for handling legislation next week to give Elian U.S. citizenship. That
would remove the boy from the jurisdiction of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, the agency that ordered him back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are a lot of extenuating circumstances,'' Lott said. ``Obviously it
could come up next week. But there are a lot of people looking at this issue and
there may be developments between now and then.''
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton supported the grandmothers' cause, hinting he might veto
the citizenship legislation if it passes. And those in the Senate seeking
Elian's return to Cuba suggested they might use delaying tactics, including a
filibuster, to keep the Senate from debating the measure.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers met with several members of Congress this week and asked
them not to pass such a bill.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's our right to see our grandson and take him back home,'' said Mrs.
Quintana, the child's paternal grandmother.
</P>
<P>
	   One of their supporters in the Senate, Connecticut Democrat Christopher
Dodd, said it was ``pathetic'' that Congress would get involved in the life of a
6-year-old. ``We can have good families in bad countries,'' he said. ``This is a
good family.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite no prospect of taking Elian with them, his grandmothers were still
looking forward to the visit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know if I'll cry or if I'll laugh,'' Mrs. Rodriguez, Elian's
maternal grandmother, told CNN on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Eig said Elian was ``a little bit afraid to go all by himself because he's
afraid they might be forced to take him back to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers have said Elian has told them by telephone that he wants to
return to Cuba.

<HEADLINE> British Anti-Royalist Lawmaker Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Former lawmaker Willie Hamilton, a flinty republican who
missed few opportunities to lambast the royal family, has died at 82, funeral
organizers said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Hamilton died at a hospital in Lincoln, eastern England, early on Sunday,
funeral director Danny Docherty said. The cause of death was not given.
</P>
<P>
	   Hamilton represented the Scottish districts of West Fife, and then Fife
Central, for the Labor Party in the House of Commons from 1951 until his
retirement in 1987.
</P>
<P>
	   His frequent attacks on members of the royal family were usually blunt,
sometimes venomous, and often embarrassed the Labor leadership. But they always
ensured the maverick lawmaker huge publicity.
</P>
<P>
	   Queen Elizabeth II, Hamilton once maintained, is ``a middle-aged woman of
limited intellect who should be ditched in the (English) Channel.'' He dubbed
Prince Charles ``a nitwit and a gentle parasite'' and Princess Diana ``a very
lucky young woman with not many brains.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a 1991 memorandum to Labor's ruling body, Hamilton argued that royals
should have the status of civil servants, with their pay and working conditions
regulated by Parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   His views found little support and ultimately cost him high office. He was
regarded as talented enough for the Cabinet, but in 1964, Prime Minister Harold
Wilson informed him that he would never win such a position.
</P>
<P>
	   Hamilton later acknowledged that he hadn't been wise to attack the royals so
regularly. ``I was happy at first to get a bit of cheap publicity, but now I
realize that it was a mistake.'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Born on June 26, 1917, Hamilton was brought up in Durham, northeast England,
the son of a miner. He worked as a teacher before entering Parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   He wrote two books, ``My Queen and I'' (1975), and ``Blood on the Walls:
Memoirs of an Anti-Royalist,'' published in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   Hamilton is survived by his wife, Margaret, and a son and daughter. The
funeral will be held at Boston Crematorium on Feb. 2.

<HEADLINE> High Investor Borrowing Worries Fed  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said Wednesday the central
bank is worried about recent high levels of borrowing by investors to buy stocks
and has been studying the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Federal Reserve is reluctant to exercise its authority to tighten
limits on such borrowing, a practice known as buying on margin, he told the
Senate Banking Committee during his nomination hearing. Studies have suggested
that a rising level of stock prices is unrelated to liberal margin requirements,
Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors buy securities on margin by borrowing part of the purchase price
from their brokerage firm and putting up the securities as collateral for the
loan.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have been reluctant to move margin requirements which clearly would have
no effect on large investors" who can get credit to trade stocks in other ways,
Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed has not changed margin requirements, which generally limit borrowing
to 50 percent of a stock's purchase price, since 1974. Brokerage firms are
allowed to set limits higher than 50 percent for their customers but they cannot
make them lower.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan acknowledged, though, that upward spikes in margin levels in
November and December that were cited at the hearing by Sen. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y., had caught the Fed's attention and were under study.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can't say where this particular endeavor on our part is going to come
out," Greenspan said. When Schumer asked whether the Fed was worried about the
apparent trend, he answered, "Obviously, we are. ... If we were not worried we
would not be studying it."
</P>
<P>
	   Schumer said some people active on Wall Street had told him they "are truly
troubled by this."
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Bove, senior vice president for research at brokerage firm Raymond
James Financial, said that if the Fed were to increase margin requirements, "it
would have a devastating impact" on stock prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors would be forced to scramble to come up with more cash and the
market would suffer as a result, Bove said in a telephone interview from St.
Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   Last April, the brokers' group that operates the Nasdaq Stock Market warned
investors about excessive use of margin borrowing as swings in the market were
becoming a regular occurrence.
</P>
<P>
	   The risks of buying on margin increase in tandem with the volatility of the
markets, said NASD Regulation, the self-policing arm of the National Association
of Securities Dealers.

<HEADLINE> Md. Partners With Ripken on Stadium  </HEADLINE>
    By SETH HETTENA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Holding up pictures of his son playing baseball, the
governor on Wednesday provided the final piece of money to turn Cal Ripken's
vision of a minor league stadium and baseball academy in his hometown into a
reality.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Parris N. Glendening's 2000 budget commits $7 million over three years
to build the Ripken Stadium and Youth Baseball Academy in Aberdeen. The complex
is to be ready in 2001 at a cost of $25 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The 6,000-seat stadium will be home to a soon-to-be-named minor league team
and about 70 Atlantic League games each year. The adjacent academy will teach
baseball fundamentals "the Ripken Way" to about 5,000 children each year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Babe Ruth League's 12 and under division, renamed the Cal Ripken
Division, will play its World Series in Aberdeen. The amateur league, with more
than 858,000 players nationwide, is considering moving its headquarters from
Trenton, N.J. to the youth academy.
</P>
<P>
	   Ripken is contributing $9 million of his own money to the project.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm very excited about having the opportunity to pass the craft on to a new
generation of players at a one-of-a-kind facility," Ripken said. "But even more
important than just teaching the game that has given me so much, is having the
opportunity to make baseball fun and exciting, the way it was for me growing
up."
</P>
<P>
	   The city of Aberdeen and Harford County, which jointly contributed $7
million to the project, stand to reap huge economic rewards. The Ripken complex
will provide 430 jobs and generate an estimated $26 million in business each
year, Glendening said.
</P>
<P>
	   Maryland Baseball LLC is adding $2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The Orioles third baseman, who holds the major league record of 2,632
consecutive starts, said the idea for the complex had its origins in 1995, when
he broke the previous record held by Lou Gehrig. Players collected $75,000 to
build an "inspiration field" in Ripken's name. Cal wanted to do more.
</P>
<P>
	   Union head Donald Fehr said Ripken has set the standard for players involved
in the community.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a consensus out there: The spirit of giving back, which you see
here, is not better exemplified than in Cal Ripken," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor said the academy would give parents the same joy he got several
years ago watching his own son, Raymond, round the bases during a Babe Ruth
League game at Prince George's Stadium in Bowie.
</P>
<P>
	   "What this will do six times over is permit children from all over Maryland
and all over the country is feel that same sense of excitement and for parents,
that same sense of pride," he said.

<HEADLINE> Patriots Interview Dom Capers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- The New England Patriots on Wednesday interviewed
Jacksonville defensive coordinator Dom Capers for their vacant coaching
position.
</P>
<P>
	   Capers compiled a 31-35 record as coach of the Carolina Panthers from 1995
to 1998, the franchise's first four seasons, and took them to the NFC
championship game in their second year. He had been scheduled to interview with
New England on Tuesday, but the meeting was postponed because of a snowstorm
that blanketed the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Pittsburgh Steelers director of operations Tom Donahoe interviewed
for the general manager's job on Tuesday. Donahoe and Capers worked together in
Pittsburgh between 1992-95 when Capers was defensive coordinator and Donahue was
director of football operations.
</P>
<P>
	   The Patriots have also interviewed defensive coordinators Marvin Lewis of
Baltimore, Willie Shaw of Oakland and Steve Sidwell of New England and offensive
coordinator Gary Crowton of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no one else scheduled at this time," Patriots spokesman Stacey
James said. "There's no timetable for the hiring."
</P>
<P>
	   The Patriots had wanted to interview former New York Jets assistant Bill
Belichick to replace Pete Carroll. NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue and a federal
judge have ruled that Belichick is still bound to the Jets.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Hire Campo As Head Coach  </HEADLINE>
    By JAIME ARON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Dave Campo was hired Wednesday as head coach of the
Dallas Cowboys, a low-profile guy taking on one of the highest-profile jobs in
pro sports.
</P>
<P>
	   Campo, the Cowboys' defensive coordinator since 1995, has been with the team
since Jerry Jones bought it in 1989. Campo is among the group of assistant
coaches Jimmy Johnson brought with him from the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel like I'm family in this organization," Campo said.
</P>
<P>
	   He's only the fifth coach the Cowboys have ever had -- and the first three
all won Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
	   But Dallas hasn't been a contender for championships lately. The Cowboys
have won only one playoff game since the last title in 1995 and they're 24-24 in
the past three seasons with two first-round playoff losses.
</P>
<P>
	   Campo has one thing in common with the previous four Cowboys coaches: No NFL
head coaching experience.
</P>
<P>
	   Secondary coach Mike Zimmer is expected to replace Campo as defensive
coordinator. Campo spent six seasons overseeing the secondary before taking over
as coordinator.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones' 15-day search for a new coach hardly extended outside team
headquarters, but he described it Wednesday as "a thorough, thorough decision on
my part."
</P>
<P>
	   The only other known candidates he interviewed were special teams coach Joe
Avezzano and offensive line coach Hudson Houck.
</P>
<P>
	   Campo and kicking coordinator Steve Hoffman are the only coaches remaining
from Johnson's initial staff.
</P>
<P>
	   Campo, 42, is the third member of the Class of '89 to become an NFL head
coach, joining Norv Turner and Dave Wannstedt. Butch Davis, who was defensive
coordinator after Wannstedt and before Campo, is the head coach at the
University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   That still leaves Dallas in need of an offensive coordinator. Chan Gailey
held both jobs before being fired Jan. 11, two days after the Cowboys were blown
out in the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   Gailey, whose two-year tenure was the shortest in team history, also was the
offensive coordinator -- and that's where the team struggled most. Campo's
defense allowed 13 points in four of its eight losses.

<HEADLINE> Ford Earnings Up 8 Percent  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. ended a banner year with an 8 percent
increase in fourth-quarter operating earnings, thanks to the voracious American
appetite for trucks and sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   But while Ford and General Motors Corp. pumped up their profits to new highs
on North American sales last year, they were far less successful elsewhere
around the globe, where competition is fierce and buyers are finicky.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the healthy balance sheet, Ford's stock fell Wednesday due to a
warning to industry analysts that a lack of U.S. capacity could make earnings
targets for the first quarter of this year hard to meet.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Ford fell $2.12 1/2 to $48 in trading at 5:15 p.m. on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   The world's second-largest automaker earned $1.8 billion, or $1.47 a share,
compared to operating earnings of $1.67 billion, or $1.35 a share, in the final
three months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1998 results do not include a charge of $631 million for employee
reduction programs. For that quarter, Ford had net income of $1.04 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The earnings results beat Wall Street expectations by 2 cents a share, as
measured by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues for the quarter totaled $44 billion, an increase of 17 percent over
$38 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "Definitely the earnings were very strong, and North America continues to
lead the way," said Nicholas Lobaccaro, an analyst with Lehman Brothers. "Those
operations generate a lot of cash."
</P>
<P>
	   Ford earned $1.6 billion on its North American vehicle business in the
quarter, a 14 percent jump over last year, on revenues of $27 billion.
Meanwhile, Ford's European operations lost $55 million, while in South America,
Ford lost $95 million.
</P>
<P>
	   In the United States, Ford has harvested thick profits from its truck and
SUV lineup. It's F-Series pickups were the best-selling vehicle in the country
for 1999; Ford sells as many copies of its hulking Excursion SUV, carrying up to
$15,000 in profit per vehicle, as it can build.
</P>
<P>
	   But other markets around the world are not so strong.
</P>
<P>
	   There's little demand for SUVs in Europe, where gas is far more expensive
and space for parking a car at a premium. And in South America, struggling
economies have left automakers who spent to build new plants in a lurch. The
result has been large losses for both Ford and GM.
</P>
<P>
	   "In North America, our momentum is very strong and our results in the region
show the fundamental strength of our brands when the products are right and the
costs are right," said Ford president and CEO Jac Nasser. "Our results in Europe
and South America are unacceptable, but we are making product investments that
will deliver more hits."
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, Ford chief financial officer Henry Wallace said Ford might close a
European factory to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's clear we have excess capacity, but that's only one part of what we
need to do in Europe," Wallace said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said Ford had told them that first-quarter earnings target could be
a stretch because of the U.S. production changes. This year, Ford will put
several new truck models into production, such as the Ford Explorer Sport, an
SUV-pickup combo, and the Ford Escape/Mazda Tribute small SUVs aimed at models
from Honda and Toyota. Ford has said it has also run short of some popular
engines, including the V-8s used in its SUVs.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're at the limits of their capacity right now," said Richard Hilgert,
an analyst with Fahnestock &AMP; Co. "With new products in the first and second
half, its going to be difficult for the company to get much better (results)."
</P>
<P>
	   But analysts said Ford called estimates for all of 2000 realistic, and that
there was no sign the strong U.S. car and light truck market will falter.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're in a very strong environment," Wallace said. "We think the industry
will be down a little bit in the United States, but on the other side we see
some opportunities."
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, Ford earned $7.2 billion, or $5.86 per share, up 22 percent
over operating earnings of $5.9 billion, or $4.72 a share, in 1998. Of that
total, $5.7 billion came from its automotive operations, with a healthy North
American business making up for a $452 million loss in South America.

duty as a retirement tribute to Garibaldi, who was New Jersey's first female
Supreme Court justice, appointed by former Gov. Thomas Kean in 1982.
</P>
<P>
	   LaVecchia expressed regret that she would not be able to share court service
with Garibaldi, praising her for "her incisive comments, always delivered with
grace."
</P>
<P>
	   LaVecchia also thanked the governor for her "generous faith in me."
</P>
<P>
	   "I am anxious to participate fully in the collegiality that so warmly
emanates from the court," LaVecchia said with the current members of the high
court seated a few feet in front of her.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know that we may not always agree, but I trust the dynamic of reasoned
deliberation and open-mindedness to assist us as a group to come to wise
decisions for New Jersey and its citizens," LaVecchia said.
</P>
<P>
	   LaVecchia becomes the third woman Whitman has appointed to the court,
together with Poritz and Justice Virginia Long, who was confirmed in June.
Whitman also named Justice James Coleman in 1994 and former Attorney General
Peter Verniero last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Verniero's confirmation was the most contentious ever, passing the Senate by
a thin 21-vote margin after divisive debate concerning his qualifications, his
age (40) and his involvement in a racial discrimination controversy that has
ensnared the State Police.
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast, LaVecchia received unanimous Senate support earlier this month,
eliciting no public criticism following her nomination on Dec. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   Prior to joining Whitman's cabinet, LaVecchia was the state's top
administrative law judge and the chief lawyer for the Division of Law in the
Attorney General's Office.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman will have the opportunity to make a sixth appointment to the high
court when Justice Daniel O'Hern reaches retirement age in May.
</P>
<P>
	   After O'Hern leaves, the only member of the Supreme Court to precede
Whitman's tenure will be Gary Stein, a Kean appointee who does not face
mandatory retirement until 2003.
</P>
<P>
	   LaVecchia's husband, Michael Cole, is equally famous in his own right as a
former chief counsel and chief of staff to Kean, and currently a private
attorney retained by the state for such high profile matters as the litigation
involving the State Police.

<HEADLINE> Bush Comments on Abortion  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- George W. Bush said Wednesday night that every
child ``born and unborn should be protected in law,'' adding in campaign debate
that the Republican party must be big enough to welcome people with ``different
views'' on abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe it's important for the next president to recognize that good
people can disagree on this issue,'' the GOP presidential front-runner said in
the opening moments of the final debate before next Tuesday's New Hampshire
primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and his rivals, Sen. John McCain, Steve Forbes, Alan Keyes and Gary
Bauer, stood behind identical podiums in a television studio in Manchester six
days before the nation's first primary. Their clash was the first half of an
unusual debate double-header. Democrats Al Gore and Bill Bradley had a turn
later in the evening in the same location.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Leader Addresses Mayors  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Colombian President Andres Pastrana told American mayors
on Wednesday that a proposed $1.6 billion package to aid his country's anti-drug
efforts would bring ``very real benefits to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
	   The two-year package, unveiled earlier this month, is designed mostly to
combat drug trafficking, but also would bolster Colombia's sagging economy and
address social problems. Colombia is by far the world's largest exporter of
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   Pastrana took his campaign for the package to the U.S. Conference of Mayors
after saying he met with Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and two
other Republican senators deeply involved on the anti-drug front: Paul Coverdell
of Georgia and Mike DeWine of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional sources said later that Pastrana met with Lott but did not
meet with Coverdell and DeWine. There was no immediate explanation for the
discrepancy.
</P>
<P>
	   Lott said afterward he is generally supportive of Pastrana's approach but
told the Colombian leader that it was important that he show progress.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think the American people are going to want to just keep pouring
money into that situation if they don't make progress in terms of stopping the
growing of coca and stopping the drug running in the air and on the water,''
Lott said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also meeting with Pastrana was House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who
said he was working with President Clinton on the $1.6 billion proposal.
``President Pastrana and I are very hopeful that this package will get through
Congress quickly,'' Hastert said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Pastrana, who met with Clinton on Tuesday, said he was optimistic about
prospects for the bill after his consultations on Capitol Hill. He called the
case for helping Colombia in its struggle ``clear and compelling.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be important for Congress to hear from America's mayors in the
days and weeks ahead that this initiative is not just in Colombia's interest but
also America's,'' said Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Your voices will help ensure that this critical initiative is not
sidetracked by other legislative priorities or doomed by partisanship or
politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   The issue of illegal drug trafficking and consumption ``is one that all of
you must address every day,'' Pastrana told the mayors.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, at a breakfast meeting with reporters, Pastrana expressed optimism
about prospects for a settlement in Columbia's long-running war with leftist
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the rebels may be more ready than ever to seek a peace settlement,
citing recent conciliatory statements by their leaders as well as an evident
weariness with decades of armed struggle.
</P>
<P>
	   He noted that the leader of the FARC rebel group, Manuel Marulanda, said
recently for the first time that ``he sees the peace process as something that
could go forward.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pastrana also said that the rebels, far from seeking a Cuba-style revolution
in Colombia, seem willing to accept a multiparty democratic system.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am very optimistic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Skepticism by many on Capitol Hill about the proposed aid package is based
partly on the human rights record of the Colombian Army and the suspicion of
links between the army and paramilitary units.
</P>
<P>
	   Pastrana said abuses by the military have dropped precipitously since 1994,
when there were allegations of 2,000 such cases. He said there were but 70 last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., has said the Colombian Army must show a greater
willingness to turn over personnel accused of rights violations and a concerted
effort to thwart the paramilitary groups believed to be responsible for
thousands of deaths over the years.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Hire Campo As Head Coach  </HEADLINE>
    By JAIME ARON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Dave Campo was hired Wednesday as head coach of the
Dallas Cowboys, a low-profile guy taking on one of the highest-profile jobs in
pro sports.
</P>
<P>
	   Campo, the Cowboys' defensive coordinator since 1995, has been with the team
since Jerry Jones bought it in 1989. Campo is among the group of assistant
coaches Jimmy Johnson brought with him from the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel like I'm family in this organization," Campo said.
</P>
<P>
	   He's only the fifth coach the Cowboys have ever had -- and the first three
all won Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
	   But Dallas hasn't been a contender for championships lately. The Cowboys
have won only one playoff game since the last title in 1995 and they're 24-24 in
the past three seasons with two first-round playoff losses.
</P>
<P>
	   Campo has one thing in common with the previous four Cowboys coaches: No NFL
head coaching experience.
</P>
<P>
	   Secondary coach Mike Zimmer is expected to replace Campo as defensive
coordinator. Campo spent six seasons overseeing the secondary before taking over
as coordinator.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones' 15-day search for a new coach hardly extended outside team
headquarters, but he described it Wednesday as "a thorough, thorough decision on
my part."
</P>
<P>
	   The only other known candidates he interviewed were special teams coach Joe
Avezzano and offensive line coach Hudson Houck.
</P>
<P>
	   Campo and kicking coordinator Steve Hoffman are the only coaches remaining
from Johnson's initial staff.
</P>
<P>
	   Campo, 52, is the third member of the Class of '89 to become an NFL head
coach, joining Norv Turner and Dave Wannstedt. Butch Davis, who was defensive
coordinator after Wannstedt and before Campo, is the head coach at the
University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   That still leaves Dallas in need of an offensive coordinator. Chan Gailey
held both jobs before being fired Jan. 11, two days after the Cowboys were blown
out in the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   Gailey, whose two-year tenure was the shortest in team history, also was the
offensive coordinator -- and that's where the team struggled most. Campo's
defense allowed 13 points in four of its eight losses.

<HEADLINE> Russia Police on Alert  </HEADLINE>
   By NABI ABDULAYEV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Chechen terrorists are planning to infiltrate
the Russian region of Dagestan and use it as a base to mount attacks on Russia,
a top regional security official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Law-enforcement agencies were placed on alert throughout Russia on Tuesday
after reportedly receiving threats of Chechen terror attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   The alert was a reminder of the fear that gripped Russia in September when
bombs in four apartment buildings killed about 300 people. Authorities blamed
the blasts on Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have information that leaders of illegal formations are planning a
number of terrorist acts on the territory of Russia,'' said Akhmednabi
Magdigadzhiyev, Secretary of the Security Council of Dagestan, which borders
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   Magdigadzhiyev said the groups were aiming to force Russia's military to
ease off on an artillery and infantry attack on Grozny, the Chechen capital,
which Russian forces surrounded in December and have been trying to seize for a
month.
</P>
<P>
	   The attackers planned to infiltrate into Russia through remote and wild
mountain areas on Dagestan's border with Chechnya and intend to plant bombs,
security officials said at a news conference in the Dagestani capital of
Makhachkala.
</P>
<P>
	   Areas near military bases also were considered targets, the officials said.
Representatives of the Russia's Federal Security Service, the Interior Ministry
and the military jointly issued the warning.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal Security Service spokesman Vasily Stavitsky told the Interfax news
agency that an anti-terrorist command center had been established in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   Moscow police went on heightened alert on Tuesday and began working
emergency, 12-hour shifts. They will check basements and attics in residential
buildings and some parked cars for explosives -- similar to measures taken
during and after last year's apartment bombings.

<HEADLINE> No Snow: World Cup Skiing Canceled  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Next month's women's World Cup speed races on the
mountain where the Olympics are to be held in two years were canceled Wednesday
for lack of snow.
</P>
<P>
	Alan Ashley, the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Team's vice president for athletics,
said International Skiing Federation officials skied the course at Snowbasin to
determine whether the races, scheduled Feb. 10-12, could be held.
</P>
<P>
	``All the way over the first half of the course, things were looking quite
good,'' Ashley said. ``Then there were places we found it was thin and not
really adequate for downhill racing.''
</P>
<P>
	Also canceled was an Alpine combined World Cup event that included races at
Snowbasin and at Deer Valley resort near Park City. The latter resort reported
sufficient snow for its race, which had been scheduled Feb. 6, but FIS rules
require that both events of a combined be canceled if one cannot be held.
</P>
<P>
	It's the second time this World Cup season that Utah races were canceled. Men's
and women's slalom and giant slalom races in Park City went to Colorado in
November because of a lack of snow.
</P>
<P>
	Snowbasin remains open. Although a recreational skier might not notice a
problem on the Wildflower trail, the course was deemed unsafe for racing because
it would be difficult to properly install safety netting in shallow snow.
</P>
<P>
	``It takes very special course preparation to ensure the safety of the athletes
in terms of quality and condition of the snow,'' Ashley said.
</P>
<P>
	Cathy Priestner, the Salt Lake Organizing Committee's managing director for
sports, denied the cancellations indicate the venues won't be prepared in time
for the 2002 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
	``We know the women's (downhill) course needs to be tested,'' Priestner said.
``We've been working with the FIS and we expect to offer cooperation to get
another race rescheduled.''
</P>
<P>
	Priestner said Snowbasin's snowmaking equipment wasn't ready to operate when
the ski season began. Beginning next fall, the Olympic runs should have plenty
of coverage all season.
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures in the upper 30s in recent weeks also prevented Snowbasin from
making snow, although the area had a storm overnight and forecasters predicted
colder temperatures through next week.
</P>
<P>
	Snowbasin manager Gray Reynolds said he was confident the venue could have been
prepared in time, but World Cup rules require a decision 10 days before the
start of training runs.
</P>
<P>
	``That rule is very favorable for the athletes,'' Ashley said. ``Doing an
overseas trip, with all the equipment, making all the travel connections and
making it into the venue, is quite a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
	FIS officials were expected to announce an alternate venue for the women's
races in a few days. Ashley said the races probably would be awarded to a
European site, meaning the tour likely is finished in North America for the
season.
</P>
<P>
	Snowbasin is the site for men's and women's downhill and super-G races during
the Olympics. The next World Cup events on the course are men's downhill races
in February 2001.

<HEADLINE> Mac Workers Who Adopt Get Leave  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Freddie Mac, the federally chartered mortgage company,
said Wednesday it will give employees who adopt up to six weeks of paid leave
time to care for the child.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We recognize that adoption is a lifelong commitment that deserves all of
the benefits that giving birth receives,'' said Candice Mendenhall, Freddie
Mac's senior vice president of human resources.
</P>
<P>
	   Last fall, President Clinton proposed that states subsidize parental leaves
for people after the birth or adoption of a child.
</P>
<P>
	   Parents are already entitled to up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave with the
guarantee of job protection under the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act. About
24 million people have used some or all of their entitled 12 weeks to care for a
new baby or other family member.
</P>
<P>
	   But some parents don't take a leave because they don't want to lose the
income.
</P>
<P>
	   Freddie Mac employees who work full or part-time, have been with the company
six months or more and work at least 20 hours or more a week are eligible for
the paid leave.
</P>
<P>
	   Freddie Mac -- a government-chartered corporations whose stock is publicly
traded -- buys mortgages from original lenders such as banks and packages them
into securities for resale to investors. The company has 3,000 employees.

<HEADLINE> Breast Cancer Ads Cause Stir  </HEADLINE>
   By KIM CURTIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Some residents of the San Francisco Bay area are upset
about cancer awareness posters that depict provocatively posed women baring
mastectomy scars in place of breasts.
</P>
<P>
	   At first glance, they could be ads for Obsession perfume, Cosmopolitan
magazine or a Victoria's Secret catalog. But the posters feature the chest of
Andrea Martin, scarred by a double mastectomy, superimposed on the bodies of
models.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We did expect there to be a mixed reaction, that's why we did it,'' said
Martin, 53, founder of The Breast Cancer Fund, a local nonprofit organization.
``It's very easy to lapse into acceptance of something unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
	   The posters went up in 37 bus shelters two weeks ago in Santa Clara and
Contra Costa counties. Two posters came down after residents complained. Outdoor
Systems, the billboard company that had donated space for the ads in 20 San
Francisco bus shelters, refused to use them after seeing them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We found it to be unacceptable,'' company spokesman Stephen Shinn said.
</P>
<P>
	   The models, photographer and advertising agency all donated their time to
make the posters. One ad, mimicking a Victoria's Secret lingerie ad, features a
woman wearing a bra and panties exposing one scar. It reads: ``It's no secret
society is obsessed with breasts, but what are we doing about breast cancer?''
</P>
<P>
	   American Cancer Society spokeswoman Joann Schellenbach fears the campaign
may be too sophisticated for its audience.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The point they're making is breasts are viewed as playthings and sexual
things and to deliberately do something so opposite to that is going to be very
shocking,'' Schellenbach said. ``I think it's daring and risky, but if it works
well, then I congratulate them for doing it.''

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Co-Chair To Retire  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Robert Eaton, the former
Chrysler chairman and CEO who helped orchestrate one of the largest industrial
mergers ever with Daimler-Benz AG, will retire from the company March 31.
</P>
<P>
	   Eaton, 59, gave the announcement to a meeting of senior managers Wednesday,
saying that "this is the right time for me to go."
</P>
<P>
	   "This of course should be no surprise to anyone. I've said from the very
beginning that when this merger is complete, I would be retiring. The time is
now."
</P>
<P>
	   When Chrysler was acquired by Daimler-Benz AG in 1998, Eaton said he would
share the job of chairman with Daimler-Benz head Juergen Schrempp for no more
than three years, then retire. Eaton had said he would retire earlier if the
major hurdles of the merger were completed.
</P>
<P>
	   While the marriage was originally billed as a merger of equals -- with
headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany and Auburn Hills, Mich. -- DaimlerChrysler
has become a German-American company with the emphasis on German. Most of its
stock is held in Germany; the company is incorporated under German business
laws, and a majority of its upper managers come from the Daimler-Benz side.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite Germany's dominance, the divisions run their businesses with little
interference from across the Atlantic. Chrysler's culture has changed little
since the merger, and still accounts for nearly half of the merged company's
profits and revenues.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's been clear for some time that the Germans have been in the
power position," said David Cole, the head of the University of Michigan's
Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation. "But it's also clear they are
not tampering with the profitable Chrysler side."
</P>
<P>
	   Eaton, a mechanical engineer, joined Chrysler in 1992 after a 29-year career
at General Motors Corp. Eaton had worked in a variety of jobs at GM, including
running GM's European operations, before joining Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
	   Eaton was promoted to chairman and chief executive officer on Jan. 1, 1993,
replacing Lee Iacocca. During his tenure, Chrysler reworked itself from the
weakest of the Big Three automakers into a highly profitable company.
</P>
<P>
	   But Eaton also came to believe that Chrysler could not face the future
alone, that only a handful of automakers could survive and compete globally.
</P>
<P>
	   "We recognized we weren't going to be able to grow as a single company
internationally as we felt was necessary. We felt it was a tremendous
opportunity for Chrysler," Eaton said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   He and Schrempp began talking about a possible combination at the 1998
Detroit auto show, and announced the $32.8 billion deal five months later.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are leading a new trend we believe will change the future, the face of
the industry," Eaton said when the deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
	   The two leaders acknowledged the merger wouldn't be easy. Their own study of
transnational mergers suggests that 70 percent failed to achieve the kind of
success that had been anticipated.
</P>
<P>
	   The resulting company -- named DaimlerChrysler after a long series of
negotiations -- not only makes cars, but commercial trucks, trains and rockets
as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the merger, several top Chrysler executives have left, including its
highly regarded president, Thomas Stallkamp, who had been mentioned as a
possible successor to Eaton.
</P>
<P>
	   DaimlerChrysler's stock price has slowly fallen from its post-merger highs,
when it was above $100 a share; shares of DaimlerChrysler were trading down 81
1/4 cents to $67.18 3/4 at 5:15 p.m. EST on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   And there have been concerns that the freewheeling spirit of Chrysler was a
poor fit with the regimental view of Daimler. Eaton worked hard to sell the
merger to employees and shareholders, and to ease concerns about culture
clashes.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think you'll ever end up with one culture," he said Wednesday. "We
want to have the culture of wherever we work around the world. I feel very good
about the synergies we've produced so far."
</P>
<P>
	   University of Michigan's Cole said it was too early to pass judgment on the
success of the merger, since the company has had few high-profile opportunities
to collaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   "They probably oversold the level of synergies and the potential for cost
savings," Cole said. "There was no real overlap in products -- they filled in
each other's blank spaces."
</P>
<P>
	   David Healy, an analyst with Burnham Securities, said the effects of Eaton's
departure on the company's stock and stockholders would be less than the effect
from Stallkamp's departure.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think Eaton's retirement will rattle anybody," Healy said. "He's
been seen as a lame duck since the shakeup" last fall.
</P>
<P>
	   When Eaton retires, Schrempp will become the sole chairman of
DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every achievement of this company in the future will bear a portion of
Bob's legacy of leadership and vision," Schrempp said in a statement. "Bob
Eaton's dedication and role in the transition made DaimlerChrysler possible, and
has been a key to its success."

   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's space agency approved a launch schedule for February
from the Baikonur site, including the first of a series of flights to revive the
Mir space station, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia had considered letting the Mir, which has been flying by
remote-control since August, burn up in the atmosphere rather than spend the
millions of dollars needed to maintain the 14-year-old orbiting outpost.

resources on the International Space Station.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani Senate campaign targets right-wing voters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - While Mayor Rudolph Giuliani takes pride in an
independent streak that leads him to buck the values arch-conservative
Republicans hold dear, his U.S. Senate campaign has solicited money from
right-wing groups that oppose abortion and gay rights, and back "English-only"
laws.
<P>
	   That far right agenda is at odds with Giuliani's own pro-choice views and
his stance in favor of protecting the rights of gays and immigrants. The
conservative agenda also runs counter to his image as a moderate Republican -
which has helped him garner support in overwhelmingly Democratic New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   The story was first reported Wednesday by the New York Observer.
</P>
<P>
	   With the aid of an aggressive direct mail operation targeting self-described
right-wing voters, Giuliani's campaign collected $12 million in 1999. Giuliani
has raised $4 million more than his likely opponent, first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton. The race is likely to be one of the most expensive U.S. Senate
campaigns in history.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, Giuliani's direct mail operation has accounted for 40 percent of the
$12 million the campaign has raised.
</P>
<P>
	   The camp obtained the names of individuals by buying lists of people linked
to right-wing causes. Most of the letters were sent to out-of-state voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani's campaign chairman Bruce Teitelbaum said Wednesday that despite
thousands of solicitations mailed to individuals with arch-conservative agendas,
the mayor's beliefs have not shifted.
</P>
<P>
	   "The mayor's positions for pro-choice, for gay rights and for immigrant
rights have not changed," Teitelbaum said. "He still believes in them, he will
not change them, and nothing in the fundraising letters say he will."
</P>
<P>
	   But one of the letters sent to right-wing individuals dated November 1999,
includes the line, "I make this request convinced that you and I share the same
hopes and dreams for the future of America."
</P>
<P>
	   The letter adds, "The national Democrats, along with some of the most
liberal and radical interest groups in the nation, are already raising millions
of dollars to put Hillary Clinton in the Senate where she can forcefully advance
both her left-wing agenda and theirs."
</P>
<P>
	   The next line is underlined: "If they win, we lose - and all of America will
pay a tremendous price."
</P>
<P>
	   The letter adds however, that Giuliani's "platform will be established very
strongly on my past record and the issues I have advanced as mayor of New York."
Giuliani is a law-and-order mayor for sure, but he's also pro-choice, in favor
of providing public services to immigrants and pro-gun control.
</P>
<P>
	   Other Giuliani fundraising letters mention the mayor's ties to former
President Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
	   And despite the Giuliani campaign's denials, Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's
spokesman, said the fundraising letters may portend a rightward shift.
</P>
<P>
	   "If these are Rudy Giuliani's allies, what kind of senator will he be?,"
Wolfson said. "Whose interests will he represent in the Senate? New York's or
the far-right's?"
</P>
<P>
	   The architect of Giuliani's direct mail strategy is Richard Viguerie, who is
credited with virtually inventing the modern day direct mail operation. He
obtained the mailing lists and helped write some of the fundraising letters.
</P>
<P>
	   For decades Viguerie has been linked almost exclusively to conservative
causes and candidates, including Barry Goldwater, George Wallace, the Moral
Majority and Patrick Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
	   The mailing lists being used by the Giuliani campaign came from Response
Unlimited Inc., a company based in Waynesboro, Va., which sells lists of people
linked to right-wing causes.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the company's owner, Philip Zodhiates, the Giuliani campaign
bought lists that include supporters of the Catholic Alliance, an anti-abortion
offshoot of the Christian Coalition; and people who bought things peddled by
conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh.
</P>
<P>
	   The lists also include backers of the American Patriot Donors, a group that
opposes gay rights and supported Iran-Contra figure Oliver North; and supporters
of English Language Advocates, which drafted an initiative to make Arizona an
English-only state.

<HEADLINE> House Panel Studies Border Security  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN HUGHES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A combination of heightened U.S. border security and
stricter Canadian immigration laws would help keep terrorists from entering the
United States through Canada, experts told a House subcommittee on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Security is so lax now that Ahmed Ressam, an alleged Algerian terrorist,
chose to cross at a U.S. checkpoint in Port Angeles, Wash., instead of using an
open frontier, said Gary Stubblefield, an international security consultant.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Clearly, terrorists such as Ressam believe our border security is a
joke,'' Stubblefield told the Judiciary Committee's panel on immigration and
claims.
</P>
<P>
	   Stubblefield said Ressam was carrying a type of explosive that is often used
to detonate a much larger bomb.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In my view, Ressam was planning up to four massive attacks on the scale of
the Oklahoma federal building or World Trade Towers bombings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, who chairs the subcommittee, said Ressam's arrest
``was a loud wake-up call'' about border security.
</P>
<P>
	   He noted there still are only 300 border agents along the 4,000-mile
U.S.-Canadian border, even though Congress has authorized and funded 1,000 new
agents per year since 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Ressam was arrested Dec. 14 after authorities said his rental car contained
bombmaking materials. Five days later, a Canadian woman was arrested as she
tried to cross into the United States at Beecher Falls, Vt. Prosecutors later
linked Lucia Garofalo to Ressam through telephone records.
</P>
<P>
	   Several experts criticized Canada for having overly generous immigration
laws that give terrorists easy access to North America.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fact that Canadians themselves have not been traditional targets of
political violence has meant a failure of popular vigilance, a failure reflected
... on the part of successive Canadian governments,'' said David Harris, former
chief of strategic planning for the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.
</P>
<P>
	   Raymond Chretien, Canada's U.S. ambassador, defended the laws.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When it comes to fighting terrorism, our laws are as strict or more strict
than American laws,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the arrests of Ressam and Garofalo were ``a success story,'' but
acknowledged Canadian officials are looking at ways to make it easier to detain
suspected terrorists before they try to cross the border.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We clearly need to have better security,'' Smith said after the hearing,
adding the United States should know who is entering the country and what they
are bringing with them.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress already has tried to address the problem. It gave the Immigration
and Naturalization Service until March 30, 2001, to develop an automated system
to track all people who cross the U.S. border. Critics say any such system will
result in border backups that affect trade and tourism.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS has done limited testing of a system that uses cards with magnetic
strips, but the agency is nowhere near implementing it nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Christopher Sands, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington, told the subcommittee the United States should take bold
actions, such as spending more for border protection or forming a high-level
commission with Canada to examine security problems in both countries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've tried to discourage panic,'' Sands said, ``but in trying to
discourage panic, we have sent a message that it's business as usual.''

<HEADLINE> Moderat GOP Group Rips Forbes Ad  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A moderate GOP group is on the air with another ad
slamming Steve Forbes for attacks on Republican front-runner George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican Leadership Council, which includes many Bush supporters,
cites a letter from Bob Dole complaining that Forbes' attacks on him in 1996
helped Democrats win that November.
</P>
<P>
	   The group's newest television spot quotes Dole's letter, which was published
as a newspaper ad earlier this month in the Des Moines Register. ``I emerged the
Republican nominee, battered, bruised and broke, and a much easier target for
the negative Clinton-Gore fall campaign,'' Dole wrote. ``I speak up now only
because it could be happening again.''
</P>
<P>
	   The TV ad closes with: ``Mr. Forbes: Stop the negative ads. Don't help the
Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
	   It will run in New Hampshire for four days beginning Thursday or Friday on
stations in Boston and Manchester. The RLC is buying enough time so that the
typical TV viewer will see the ad about four times over the stretch.
</P>
<P>
	   It is the third anit-Forbes ad that the RLC has run. The first warned him
not to run negative ads; the second two have chided him for doing just that.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're hammering the point that we don't want our party to be divided by
negative campaigning,'' said RLC Executive Director Mark Miller.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue is a Forbes ad that accuses Bush of breaking his promise to oppose
tax hikes in Texas. At one point, Bush supported a plan that included some tax
increases but larger tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes contends the RLC is a front group for Bush, with more than half of
its board of advisers having endorsed him and many of the group's contributors
also giving him money. Forbes has a complaint pending with the Federal Election
Commission that the RLC ads amount to an illegal contribution to Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These guys are going to be spending a lot on legal fees,'' said Forbes
campaign manager Bill Dal Col. As for the group's newest ad, he said: ``It's
just further proof of how threatened by Steve Forbes the Washington lobbyists
and insiders are.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Comments on Abortion  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- George W. Bush said Wednesday night that every
child ``born and unborn should be protected in law,'' adding in campaign debate
that the Republican party must be big enough to welcome people with ``different
views'' on abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe it's important for the next president to recognize that good
people can disagree on this issue,'' the GOP presidential front-runner said in
the opening moments of the final debate before next Tuesday's New Hampshire
primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and his rivals, Sen. John McCain, Steve Forbes, Alan Keyes and Gary
Bauer, stood behind identical podiums in a television studio in Manchester six
days before the nation's first primary. Their clash was the first half of an
unusual debate double-header. Democrats Al Gore and Bill Bradley had a turn
later in the evening in the same location.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no opportunity for candidates to challenge Bush in the opening
moments of the debate.
</P>
<P>
	   The first question of the night went to Gary Bauer, and related to health
care. He called for stronger rights for patients in disputes with their HMOs,
greater access to long term care and medical savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes renewed his opposition to the income tax, and McCain pledged that --
unlike the Clinton administration -- he would make sure that a veteran was among
Cabinet-level officials responsible for defense and foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
	   The field was smaller by one -- Sen. Orrin Hatch dropped out earlier in the
day and pledged his support for Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Abortion has flared in recent days as the candidates gird for the opening
round of primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   As he has before, Bush said he was a ``pro-life'' candidate, but he made no
attempt to call for the repeal of the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized
abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must welcome people from different persuasions into our party, from
different points of view into our party,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day, Bush focused on laying out his plan for using the budget
surplus to cut taxes, reduce the national debt and shore up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   Other candidates said the debate would be an important one, drawing more
interest with the primary less than a week away.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think people will be watching who perhaps weren't watching before
because of the proximity of the vote,'' said McCain. But he had had to spend
much of the day clarifying his anti-abortion stance.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, in the hours before the debate, was talking about the 30 percent he
won in the Iowa caucuses Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We started to get (a mandate) in Iowa. I hope we can get it going here,''
Forbes said while campaigning in Nashua.
</P>
<P>
	   Abortion, which played a substantial role in Monday's Iowa caucuses, with
the strong impact of the Christian right, is less significant as a political
factor in New Hampshire. There are more independents than either registered
Republicans or Democrats here.
</P>
<P>
	   But the issue took center stage again earlier Wednesday when McCain, who
leads Bush in most New Hampshire polls this week, was asked by a reporter
whether he would stop his 15-year-old daughter from undergoing the procedure.
</P>
<P>
	   After first saying it would be her decision, McCain, whose home state has a
parental consent law for minors, clarified his position.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The family decision will be made by the family,'' he said, and not by his
daughter alone. McCain has repeatedly said he opposes abortion, believes that
life begins at conception and supports a requirement of parental consent.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue has shadowed the candidates throughout the campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Previously, Bush, who has faced frequent questions about the strength of his
anti-abortion convictions, was asked a slightly different question -- what he
would do if one of his relatives faced such a decision because of rape. ``It
would be up to her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes on Wednesday attacked McCain's comments as too weak. He said neither
the Arizona senator nor Bush could succeed as the GOP's presidential nominee
because neither man can articulate an acceptable position on the thorny issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They don't have it in their hearts, they don't have it in their minds.
They haven't thought it through,'' Keyes said in Manchester.

<HEADLINE> Grandmothers, Elian Reunited  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez was finally reunited with his
grandmothers Wednesday at a ``neutral site'' that had to be arranged by the U.S.
government because of the personal and political passions swirling around the
6-year-old Cuban boy.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was driven to a nun's house in Miami Beach to see his grandmothers,
who had flown in from Washington and were then brought to the home in a
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
	   Little over an hour and a half after the women arrived, Elian and his Miami
relatives left, to the cheers of demonstrators gathered outside.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers came to the United States last week to appeal to the
American people and Congress to send the boy back to his father in Cuba. Elian's
relatives in Miami want him to stay and are fighting a U.S. government order
sending him back.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department had said the grandmothers would see Elian privately,
with the boy's Florida relatives nearby in the house. Elian's father, in a
letter printed in the Communist Party newspaper Granma, asked to be included in
the reunion by telephone.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers had also flown to Miami on Monday but left town without
seeing Elian. The Miami relatives insisted that any reunion take place at their
home in the Little Havana neighborhood, but the grandmothers said they were
uncomfortable going there. Anti-Castro Cuban immigrants have been holding
protests around the home.
</P>
<P>
	   After long negotiations, the Justice Department ordered Elian's relatives to
bring him to the nun's house. The agency said it had the authority to do so
under the arrangement letting the boy stay in this country pending further
immigration proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   Mariela Quintana and Raquel Rodriguez had not seen their grandson since
before he left Cuba for the United States with his mother, who died along with
10 other people when their boat capsized. Elian was found clinging to an inner
tube off the Florida coast on Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
	   The reunion was held at the home of Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, president of
Barry University. O'Laughlin, 70, has a history of helping immigrants and had
said she would serve as ``welcomer'' and ``hugger.''
</P>
<P>
	   As the grandmothers drove up to the house, a few people tossed flowers at
their car. About 200 demonstrators were waiting outside the house; some cheered
and others booed as the grandmothers were driven by.
</P>
<P>
	   On Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott indicated he has no solid
plans for handling legislation next week to give Elian U.S. citizenship. That
would remove the boy from the jurisdiction of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, the agency that ordered him back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are a lot of extenuating circumstances,'' Lott said. ``Obviously it
could come up next week. But there are a lot of people looking at this issue and
there may be developments between now and then.''
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton supported the grandmothers' cause, hinting he might veto
the citizenship legislation if it passes. And those in the Senate seeking
Elian's return to Cuba suggested they might use delaying tactics, including a
filibuster, to keep the Senate from debating the measure.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers met with several members of Congress this week and asked
them not to pass such a bill.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's our right to see our grandson and take him back home,'' said Mrs.
Quintana, the child's paternal grandmother.
</P>
<P>
	   One of their supporters in the Senate, Connecticut Democrat Christopher
Dodd, said it was ``pathetic'' that Congress would get involved in the life of a
6-year-old. ``We can have good families in bad countries,'' he said. ``This is a
good family.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite no prospect of taking Elian with them, his grandmothers were still
looking forward to the visit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know if I'll cry or if I'll laugh,'' Mrs. Rodriguez, Elian's
maternal grandmother, told CNN on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Spencer Eig, an attorney for the boy's Miami relatives, said before the
reunion that Elian was ``a little bit afraid to go all by himself because he's
afraid they might be forced to take him back to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers have said Elian has told them by telephone that he wants to
return to Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Klesko: Rocker Will Have it Rough  </HEADLINE>
    By BERNIE WILSON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- While hunting in Mexico last weekend, Ryan Klesko tried to
impress on John Rocker that he's going to be the one standing in the line of
fire this baseball season.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's got a tough year ahead of him," Klesko said of his friend and former
teammate, who's been condemned by many for his disparaging remarks about
immigrants, minorities and homosexuals. "He's going to have to take the heat and
he's going to have to understand a lot of people are upset with him. He's going
to have to pay for it for a while."
</P>
<P>
	   Klesko met with the San Diego media on Wednesday for the first time since he
and Bret Boone were traded from the Atlanta Braves to the Padres on Dec. 22. The
subject quickly turned to Rocker, because Klesko has been one of the few in
baseball to publicly support the relief pitcher.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Klesko made it clear that his loyalty only goes so far.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't agree with what he said at all," said Klesko, who added that Rocker
"has too much redneck in him, I guess."
</P>
<P>
	   "All I can do is talk to him as a friend, try to help him understand that he
can't just go out and say this stuff."
</P>
<P>
	   Rocker told Sports Illustrated last month that he would never play for a New
York team because he didn't want to ride a train "next to some queer with AIDS."
He also said, "I'm not a very big fan of foreigners. ... How the hell did they
get in this country?" and he called a black teammate a "fat monkey."
</P>
<P>
	   Rocker has since apologized and said he was not a racist. That wasn't enough
to sway New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter, who told the New York Post this
week that he wouldn't sit in the same room with Rocker. Jeter's father is black
and his mother is Irish.
</P>
<P>
	   After Rocker sparred with New York Mets fans during the playoffs, "he may
have gotten a little attention and decided to take it to the next level and that
really got him in trouble," Klesko said.
</P>
<P>
	   During their hunting trip, "I told him if he can just go out there and be
himself instead of trying to make everybody think he's some type of different
person, then he'll be all right, because he's really not like that. He does have
a bit of a short fuse, but other than that, he's a good person."
</P>
<P>
	   Klesko thinks some of Rocker's remarks were taken out of context. But he
also said: "I know John's good side. Maybe I didn't see his bad side."
</P>
<P>
	   Klesko won't be around to support Rocker during spring training. Braves
pitcher Tom Glavine has said that Rocker will have some explaining to do to his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's so much going down with that team, losing (Andres) Galarraga and
(Kerry) Ligtenberg" to injuries and illness, the first baseman said. "They seem
to pull together when stuff like that happens. But this is a little different.
This isn't injury stuff. It's a lot of chaos. To tell you the truth, I'm kind of
glad to get out of there because of all of that."
</P>
<P>
	   Like Braves owner Ted Turner, Klesko thinks Rocker deserves a chance to
atone for his remarks.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's got to be some forgiveness somewhere because people do make
mistakes. He's made a pretty big one and he's going to have to try to change and
show everybody that he's not the way everybody's perceived him to be."

coordination, top Mexican officials gave an upbeat evaluation Wednesday of their
fight against drug smuggling and said they were more than doubling their
spending on the battle.
</P>
<P>
	   But it was unclear what effect their struggle has had on the availability of
drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first time in years, Mexico doesn't have to worry much about winning
``certification'' in the United States' annual evaluation of countries'
cooperation in combatting drugs. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said this
month that cooperation has been ``at a very good level.''
</P>
<P>
	   So in the Mexican government's annual report on the progress of anti-drug
efforts, officials delivered a barrage of figures and plans they said showed
they have come far in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can't declare victory, but without a doubt the results that we are
evaluating today show the seriousness of our institutional resolve,'' said
Interior Secretary Diodoro Carrasco.
</P>
<P>
	   Carrasco said the overall budget for the fight against drugs -- those funds
split among the attorney general's office, the interior secretariat, the army
and the navy -- increased 167 percent in the 2000 budget, from $172 million to
$462 million.
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't clear whether the increase represented a one-time spending spree
for new equipment, or whether Mexico's drug budget is simply skyrocketing.
</P>
<P>
	   In a separate meeting with a small group of foreign correspondents, Mexico's
top anti-drug prosecutor said an ambitious plan announced a year ago to buy
high-tech equipment and improve coordination between government agencies
fighting drugs -- principally judicial and military forces -- has been a
success.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said drug seizures rose from 1998 to 1999: 7 percent for cocaine,
47 percent for marijuana, 82 percent for heroin and 418 percent for opium gum,
which is the raw material for heroin.
</P>
<P>
	   There was an 8 percent drop in eradication of heroin-poppy fields, but
Mariano Herran Salvatti, who leads the anti-drug operations of the attorney
general's office, attributed that to a shift in growing patterns.
</P>
<P>
	   He said farmers have begun to use genetically engineered poppy plants that
grow many bulbs, rather than the traditional single-bulb plants, and are
therefore able to produce much more opium gum on the same acreage.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials offered no estimates of how much drugs were making their way to
the market, making their true success hard to gauge.

<HEADLINE> Connecticut mayors give Dodd their wish list  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - The mayors of some of Connecticut's largest cities
have a simple request for their elected representatives in Washington: Send more
money.
<P>
	   And while they're at it, the municipal leaders could also use some help
keeping their streets safe and their schools running, the mayors told Sen. Chris
Dodd, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayors of Hartford, New Britain, East Hartford, Bridgeport, Danbury and
West Haven were in Washington on Wednesday for a meeting of the U.S. Conference
of Mayors.
</P>
<P>
	   Bridgeport, the third major U.S. city to sue the gun industry, would like
Congress to pass pending legislation strengthening gun control laws, Mayor Joe
Ganim said. If Congress dealt with the issue the city would likely drop its
lawsuit, according to Ganim.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'd walk away from money damages in a minute," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bridgeport's lawsuit was thrown out last month by a judge who said the city
had no standing to sue, a ruling the city plans to appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress could also help local school districts by offering funding for
programs like class-size reduction, Dodd said. School districts are often
crippled by the amount of money they must spend on special education, said
Danbury Mayor Gene Eriquez.
</P>
<P>
	   Communication with Dodd and other Capitol Hill lawmakers is also the key to
getting funding for smaller local projects, said West Haven's mayor, Richard
Borer.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the mayors had specific requests in mind. Eriquez, for example, is
hoping the federal government can contribute to the cost of building a sewer
system necessary for economic development of the city's west side.
</P>
<P>
	   Borer could use dollars for low-income housing.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Hartford Mayor Michael P. Peters and East Hartford Mayor Tim Larson are
looking for federal transportation money.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our mass is transit is not up to what it should be," Peters said.
</P>
<P>
	   All the mayors stressed the importance of continuing community development
block grants, which provide funding for economic development and social
programs. New Britain Mayor Lucian Pawlak credits such a grant for his city's
rebirth as "the organic farming center of New England."
</P>
<P>
	   The grants, often the target of would-be budget cutters, should be
reauthorized every two years instead of an annually as they are now, Dodd said.
</P>
<P>
	   "At least that way you'd have some stability. You may not like all the
results but at least you'd know what the results are," he told Eriquez and
Borer.

<HEADLINE> Suspected IRA Dissident Charged  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- A suspected Irish Republican Army dissident was
arraigned Wednesday on charges of transporting weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   Christopher Smith is accused of possessing two armor-piercing blast bombs
primed with Semtex explosive, 17 homemade grenades, 11 rockets and weapon-making
equipment. He did not speak during the hearing at Ireland's anti-terrorist
Special Criminal Court.
</P>
<P>
	   Detective Sgt. John Long testified that Smith was caught after running away
from his van, which was loaded with weapons, at a police checkpoint Sunday
night. Smith, 38, from Limerick in southwest Ireland, was ordered held without
bail pending a Feb. 15 court appearance.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, police freed a husband and wife who were taken into custody
Tuesday in connection with Smith's arrest and on suspicion of involvement in
dissident IRA activities. The two were not charged.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said they suspect Smith could be linked to a dissident IRA
group.
</P>
<P>
	   Two small IRA factions, the Continuity IRA and Real IRA, oppose Northern
Ireland's 1998 peace accord, saying it failed to abolish the Protestant-majority
state and its links with Britain. Both groups have appealed in recent weeks for
weapons and defectors from the mainstream IRA, which has been observing a
cease-fire since 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither dissident group has launched any attacks in Northern Ireland since
August 1998, when the Real IRA killed 29 people with a car bomb in the town of
Omagh -- the deadliest terrorist strike in the province's history. But Ireland's
police chief, Pat Byrne, warned Tuesday that both groups remain capable of
mounting an Omagh-scale attack.

<HEADLINE> Elway Has Business at Super Bowl  </HEADLINE>
    By AMY FRAZIER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Three of the world's greatest athletes were in Atlanta on
Wednesday -- and no, none of them will see any Super Bowl action Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Although John Elway, retired Denver Broncos quarterback, is no stranger to
the big event, he wasn't talking football.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, he was talking business, and so was Michael Jordan and Wayne
Gretzky. The three mega-stars, all recently retired, were in town to launch
MVP.com. The sporting goods Web site, with Elway as chairman, has the financial
backing of him and his two superstar golfing buddies.
</P>
<P>
	   Elway, who has been in five Super Bowls, said he missed the excitement a
little. But he knew it was time to retire and "it was time for me to move on."
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's perfect we were able to get this all put together and announce
it down here so I could come down. Actually, this will be the first game I've
ever gone to," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   When it came to predictions for Sunday, Jordan said it could go either way.
Gretzky had no comment and Elway decided to go with Tennessee, because he played
for the AFC.
</P>
<P>
	   Their Web site went online at 12:30 p.m. Wednesday. All three athletes have
an undisclosed financial stake in the company, which couples merchandise with
insight from top athletes and experts. The Chicago-based company has more than
25,000 items available for a wide range of sports from fishing to football.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was thrilled to death with my football career, but I wanted my afterlife
to be as successful as my football career," said Elway.
</P>
<P>
	   So, he decided to sell something he's been involved with his whole life and
bring in his recently retired friends as advisers and members of the board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
	   "We know we're all competitors and have been competitors in our careers and
we want to be the best," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   MVP.com won't interfere with endorsements the athletes already have, Elway
said. Though the athletes will give advice on the site they won't endorse a
particular product.
</P>
<P>
	   Jordan said the company gives him a chance not just to put his name on a
product but to get involved and contribute.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's my way of passing my knowledge on to the next great athlete -- be it
basketball or business, whatever it may be," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gretzky, who retired from the NHL last year, said the site is a "great
opportunity for the sport of hockey."
</P>
<P>
	   "It will give parents the opportunity to see exactly the kind of equipment
... the kids need to have to be able to enjoy the game."
</P>
<P>
	   But the celebrity names may not be enough for the company to succeed in the
highly competitive Internet retail market, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
	   "It can be one piece of the puzzle," said David Trossman, an analyst with
First Union Securities. "But they need to have a complete puzzle," with an easy
to navigate site, good customer service and unique merchandise.
</P>
<P>
	   "They have to balance the brand with the amount of money they throw at it,"
Trossman said. "The biggest risk is throwing a lot of money at marketing and the
customer acquisition side of it without really understanding what the brand is
all about."
</P>
<P>
	   The company, founded in December, has a mass marketing campaign featuring
all three super-athletes.
</P>
<P>
	   MVP.com forged a $205 million deal with CBS Corp. -- including a 10-year
$120 million contract and $85 million worth of advertising over four years -- to
market the site and its products on CBS's SportsLine.com, a sports information
Web site that also has marketed some sporting goods.
</P>
<P>
	   Initially, MVP.com will get its merchandise from Galyan's Trading Co., an
Indianapolis-based sporting goods company.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Chief To Eye New Pilot Rules  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID A. LIEB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The nation's chief transportation safety officer
said Wednesday he wants to use last summer's fatal crash of an American Airlines
jet as a reason to examine whether new rules are needed to guard against pilot
fatigue.
</P>
<P>
	   Fatigue is just one of several factors, including poor weather, being
weighed as a possible cause for the crash of Flight 1420. The plane crashed on
landing on June 1, killing 11 people and injuring 89.
</P>
<P>
	   Capt. Richard Buschmann, who was killed in the accident, was approaching the
14-hour company duty limit when the plane crashed. So was co-pilot Michael
Origel, who suffered a broken leg.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Fatigue and its effects on flight-crew performance has been and continues
to be a growing concern for the aviation community,'' said James Hall, chairman
of the National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
	   Hall cited fatigue as significant factors in the 1993 crash of an American
International Airways plane in Cuba and the recent crash of a Korean Air jet in
Guam.
</P>
<P>
	   Regardless of whether fatigue is found to be a large factor in the Little
Rock crash, Hall said, it is ``my intention in this hearing to look at the
larger picture and explore more precisely the dimensions of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
	   Buschmann and Origel began their day in Chicago, then flew to Salt Lake City
and Dallas before heading to Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
	   Origel, testifying Wednesday at a hearing about the crash, said he ``was
tired but alert'' before taking off for Little Rock. He said Buschmann did not
indicate if he was tired before taking off. But Origel later testified that the
captain yawned during the flight to Little Rock.

<HEADLINE> DEP finishes deer hunt at Bluff Point Coastal Reserve  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   GROTON, Conn. (AP) - The state Department of Environmental Protection
announced Wednesday that state hunters have finished their work at Bluff Point
Coastal Reserve after killing 74 deer, including two that animal rights
activists said were fawns.
<P>
	   The special hunt, designed to thin the Bluff Point deer herd in order to
protect the park flora, ended on Tuesday after nine days of actual hunting. The
weekday hunt began on January 12 after a judge in Hartford refused to issue a
restraining order sought by an animal rights group that contended fawns would be
killed illegally in the hunt.
</P>
<P>
	   The DEP had originally said it planned to kill 78 of the 103 deer in the
800-acre preserve. But the agency said the hunt was now over and the park would
be reopened to the public on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Ed Parker, DEP's natural resources chief, acknowledged that two young deer
were inadvertently killed during the hunt.
</P>
<P>
	   "In deference to the court, due to a pending lawsuit regarding the
definition of fawn deer, the DEP made every effort to avoid killing 'young of
the year deer,"' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bill Mannetti of the New Haven-based Animal Rights Front said the term
"young of the year deer" is nothing more than "linguistic flimflam."
</P>
<P>
	   "Its obvious that they killed fawns. I don't know why they can't just admit
they broke the law," Mannetti said.
</P>
<P>
	   Animal rights activists say state hunters frequently violate state law by
killing fawns. They contend that a fawn is any deer under one year of age but
the DEP says once a young deer loses it spots it is no longer a fawn and becomes
fair game for hunters.
</P>
<P>
	   Parker was unavailable to say whether the 'young of the year deer' killed
still had their spots. A call seeking clarification of the term was not
immediately returned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Animal Rights Front has sued the DEP in an effort to prevent the killing
of young deer in Connecticut. The lawsuit is scheduled to be heard on Feb. 9 in
Hartford Superior Court.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani Senate campaign targets right-wing voters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - While Mayor Rudolph Giuliani takes pride in an
independent streak that leads him to buck the values arch-conservative
Republicans hold dear, his U.S. Senate campaign has solicited money from
right-wing groups that oppose abortion and gay rights, and back "English-only"
laws.
<P>
	   That far right agenda is at odds with Giuliani's own pro-choice views and
his stance in favor of protecting the rights of gays and immigrants. The
conservative agenda also runs counter to his image as a moderate Republican -
which has helped him garner support in overwhelmingly Democratic New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   The story was first reported Wednesday by the New York Observer.
</P>
<P>
	   With the aid of an aggressive direct mail operation targeting self-described
right-wing voters, Giuliani's campaign collected $12 million in 1999. Giuliani
has raised $4 million more than his likely opponent, first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton. The race is likely to be one of the most expensive U.S. Senate
campaigns in history.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, Giuliani's direct mail operation has accounted for 40 percent of his
fundraising.
</P>
<P>
	   The camp obtained the names of individuals by buying lists of people linked
to right-wing causes. Most of the letters were sent to out-of-state voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani's campaign chairman Bruce Teitelbaum said Wednesday that despite
thousands of solicitations mailed to individuals with arch-conservative agendas,
the mayor's beliefs have not shifted.
</P>
<P>
	   "The mayor's positions for pro-choice, for gay rights and for immigrant
rights have not changed," Teitelbaum said. "He still believes in them, he will
not change them, and nothing in the fundraising letters say he will."
</P>
<P>
	   But one of the letters sent to right-wing individuals dated November 1999,
includes the line, "I make this request convinced that you and I share the same
hopes and dreams for the future of America."
</P>
<P>
	   The letter adds, "The national Democrats, along with some of the most
liberal and radical interest groups in the nation, are already raising millions
of dollars to put Hillary Clinton in the Senate where she can forcefully advance
both her left-wing agenda and theirs."
</P>
<P>
	   The next line is underlined: "If they win, we lose - and all of America will
pay a tremendous price."
</P>
<P>
	   The letter adds however, that Giuliani's "platform will be established very
strongly on my past record and the issues I have advanced as mayor of New York."
</P>
<P>
	   Other Giuliani fundraising letters mention the mayor's ties to former
President Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
	   And despite the Giuliani campaign's denials, Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's
spokesman, said the fundraising letters may portend a rightward shift.
</P>
<P>
	   "If these are Rudy Giuliani's allies, what kind of senator will he be?,"
Wolfson said. "Whose interests will he represent in the Senate? New York's or
the far-right's?"
</P>
<P>
	   The architect of Giuliani's direct mail strategy is Richard Viguerie, who is
credited with virtually inventing the modern day direct mail operation. For
decades he has been linked almost exclusively to conservative causes and
candidates, including Barry Goldwater, George Wallace, the Moral Majority and
Patrick Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
	   The mailing lists being used by the Giuliani campaign came from Response
Unlimited Inc., a company based in Waynesboro, Va.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the company's owner, Philip Zodhiates, the Giuliani campaign
bought lists that include supporters of the Catholic Alliance, an anti-abortion
offshoot of the Christian Coalition; and people who bought things peddled by
conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh.
</P>
<P>
	   The lists also include backers of the American Patriot Donors, a group that
opposes gay rights and supported Iran-Contra figure Oliver North; and supporters
of English Language Advocates, which drafted an initiative to make Arizona an
English-only state.

<HEADLINE> Moderate GOP Group Rips Forbes Ad  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A moderate GOP group is on the air with another ad
slamming Steve Forbes for attacks on Republican front-runner George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican Leadership Council, which includes many Bush supporters,
cites a letter from Bob Dole complaining that Forbes' attacks on him in 1996
helped Democrats win that November.
</P>
<P>
	   The group's newest television spot quotes Dole's letter, which was published
as a newspaper ad earlier this month in the Des Moines Register. ``I emerged the
Republican nominee, battered, bruised and broke, and a much easier target for
the negative Clinton-Gore fall campaign,'' Dole wrote. ``I speak up now only
because it could be happening again.''
</P>
<P>
	   The TV ad closes with: ``Mr. Forbes: Stop the negative ads. Don't help the
Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
	   It will run in New Hampshire for four days beginning Thursday or Friday on
stations in Boston and Manchester. The RLC is buying enough time so that the
typical TV viewer will see the ad about four times over the stretch.
</P>
<P>
	   It is the third anit-Forbes ad that the RLC has run. The first warned him
not to run negative ads; the second two have chided him for doing just that.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're hammering the point that we don't want our party to be divided by
negative campaigning,'' said RLC Executive Director Mark Miller.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue is a Forbes ad that accuses Bush of breaking his promise to oppose
tax hikes in Texas. At one point, Bush supported a plan that included some tax
increases but larger tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes contends the RLC is a front group for Bush, with more than half of
its board of advisers having endorsed him and many of the group's contributors
also giving him money. Forbes has a complaint pending with the Federal Election
Commission that the RLC ads amount to an illegal contribution to Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These guys are going to be spending a lot on legal fees,'' said Forbes
campaign manager Bill Dal Col. As for the group's newest ad, he said: ``It's
just further proof of how threatened by Steve Forbes the Washington lobbyists
and insiders are.''

<HEADLINE> Northrop Grumman's Profit Jumps  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Defense contractor Northrop Grumman Corp. said its
profits jumped 41 percent in the fourth quarter of 1999 over the same period
last year, but predicted flat sales and earnings for 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   The Los Angeles-based maker of the B-2 bomber had net income of $138
million, or $1.96 per share, for the quarter ended Dec. 31, the company reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   That compared to earnings of $97.8 million, or $1.43 per share, for the 1998
quarter, excluding charges that were taken for various program costs, mainly
involving Kistler Aerospace Corp. and a decrease in Northrop's production of
Boeing 747 fuselages. Including those charges, Northrop reported a loss of $3
million, or 4 cents per share, for the 1998 quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1999 quarterly results were significantly higher than the estimate of
$1.69 per share expected by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am very pleased with our excellent financial results in 1999, which was a
pivotal year for our company," said Kent Kresa, Northrop Grumman's chairman,
president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
	   The quarter had some one-time losses, but they were offset by margin
adjustments involving the company's Joint STARS military surveillance and
targeting system, and its B-2 program.
</P>
<P>
	   Northrop had expected to take those gains this year. As a result, the
company projected sales and earnings would be flat in 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   "We ... expect strong top and bottom line growth beginning in 2001," Kresa
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales for the fourth quarter were about $2.51 billion, compared to $2.54
billion in the 1998 period. For the fiscal year, sales were $9 billion, compared
with $8.9 billion reported for 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Northrop shares traded at $47.87 1/2, up 12 1/2 cents, at 5:15 p.m.
Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Northrop's 1999 net income was $483 million, or $6.93 per share, compared to
$194 million, or $2.79 per share for 1998. But again, 1998 had significant
one-time costs from various sources, including a terminated merger with Lockheed
Martin.
</P>
<P>
	   During the year, the company also generated a record $1.2 billion in cash
from operations and reduced its net debt by $700 million to $2.1 billion.

   ALBIN, Wyo. (AP) -- A snow plow slammed into a school bus on an icy road
Wednesday, killing two siblings and injuring their older brother and two other
people.
</P>
<P>
	   The crash happened just before 8 a.m. about eight miles north of the
ranching community of Albin, Wyoming State Patrol trooper Perry Jones said. The
bus had made only one stop when the crash occurred.
</P>
<P>
	   An 11-year-old girl died at the scene and her 8-year-old brother died later
at a Scottsbluff, Neb., hospital, authorities said. Their 18-year-old brother
suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   The bus driver was in serious condition with chest and abdominal injuries,
and the plow driver was treated for minor injuries and released.
</P>
<P>
	   The siblings' school, which has about 120 students, canceled classes midday.
Nine days earlier, April Sorensen, an 18-year-old senior at the K-12 school,
died of pneumonia.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Step Around Abortion  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- George W. Bush and John McCain stepped gingerly
around the abortion issue Wednesday night in feisty campaign debate, the Texas
governor saying the GOP ``must be big enough to welcome'' dissenting views, and
the Arizona senator declining to repeat earlier comments suggesting he might
permit his own child to end a pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the GOP presidential front-runner, said ``every child born and unborn
should be protected in law and every child should be protected by life.'' Still,
he said, ``we must welcome people from different persuasions into our party.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, pressed on the issue by Alan Keyes, who opposes all abortions, said,
``I am proud of my pro-life record in public life and I will continue to
maintain it. Stern-faced, the Arizonan added, ``I will not draw my children into
this discussion.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes, evidently unimpressed, turned to McCain and said in light of his
comments, ``how can we trust you'' to lead the country toward a ban on
abortions.

<HEADLINE> Albright Worries Over Kosovo Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Wednesday night
a ``serious crisis'' has arisen in Kosovo because the international community
has not fulfilled pledges of money to help reconstruct the province.
</P>
<P>
	   In Kosovo as in the region as a whole, ``it is vital that our partners join
us not only in pledging generously but also in disbursing promptly,'' Albright
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Her remarks were prepared for delivery to the European Institute, which
awarded her the 1999 Transatlantic Leadership Award.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The U.N. mission in Kosovo cannot restore electric power, provide public
security, arrange elections and revitalize the economy with promises alone,''
Albright said. ``It must have the resources required to help the people rebuild
their society and resume normal lives.''
</P>
<P>
	   She did not say by how much disbursements have fallen short of pledges for
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright said another challenge facing the transatlantic community is to
move ahead on the pact to help integrate all of Southeast Europe into the
continent's democratic mainstream.
</P>
<P>
	   She noted that the goals of the pact are to foster peaceful, tolerant
societies; build strong viable economies; replace aid with investment; and
transform the region from a source of instability into a full ``participant and
partner in the new Europe.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are under no illusions about the difficulty of the task we have set,''
she said. ``It is literally to transform the patterns of history; to replace the
whirlpools of violence leading nowhere with a steadily upward tide.''
</P>
<P>
	   The goals will not be achieved, she said, unless the international community
follows through on its commitments to help.

</P>
<P>
	   June 9, 1999 -- Australian regulators deny a revised plan by Coke to buy
Cadbury Schweppes brands because it would lessen market competition. The deal

	   July 22, 1999 -- European Union confirms raids of Coke offices in four
European nations on suspicion the company abused its dominant position by
offering retailers unfair incentives to shut out competitors.

Bush Accepts Abortion Diversity
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- George W. Bush said tonight that every child "born
and unborn should be protected in law," adding in campaign debate that the
Republican party must be big enough to welcome people with "different views" on
abortion. As he has before, Bush said he was a "pro-life" candidate, but he made
no attempt to call for the repeal of the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that
legalized abortion. "I believe it's important for the next president to
recognize that good people can disagree on this issue," the GOP presidential
front-runner said in the opening moments of the final debate before next
Tuesday's New Hampshire primary.

Grandmothers, Elian Reunited
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez was finally reunited with his
grandmothers today at a "neutral site" that had to be arranged by the U.S.
government because of the personal and political passions swirling around the
6-year-old Cuban boy. Elian was driven to a nun's house in Miami Beach to see
his grandmothers, who had flown in from Washington and were then brought to the
home in a helicopter. Little over an hour and a half after the women arrived,
Elian and his Miami relatives left, to the cheers of demonstrators gathered
outside.

House Panel Studies Border Security
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A combination of heightened U.S. border security and
stricter Canadian immigration laws would help keep terrorists from entering the
United States through Canada, experts told a House subcommittee today. Security
is so lax now that Ahmed Ressam, an alleged Algerian terrorist, chose to cross
at a U.S. checkpoint in Port Angeles, Wash., instead of using an open frontier,
said Gary Stubblefield, an international security consultant.
</P>
<SUBHEAD>
Russia Police on Alert
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Chechen terrorists are planning to infiltrate
the Russian region of Dagestan and use it as a base to mount attacks on Russia,
a top regional security official said Wednesday. Law-enforcement agencies were
placed on alert throughout Russia on Tuesday after reportedly receiving threats
of Chechen terror attacks. The alert was a reminder of the fear that gripped
Russia in September when bombs in four apartment buildings killed about 300
people. Authorities blamed the blasts on Chechen rebels.
</P>

Chechens Fiercely Defend Grozny
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Rebels armed with grenade-launchers and sniper rifles
attacked Russian troops from all sides in the Chechen capital Wednesday,
fighting to keep the federal forces from advancing on a strategic square. But
Russian military commanders continued to give an upbeat assessment of the
month-old push to take Grozny.

Storm Leaves 150,000 Without Power
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- More than 150,000 people in the Southeast were still
without power today after yesterday's massive East Coast snowstorm. Many schools
and businesses were closed again, along with all Philadelphia offices and courts
and most Maryland state offices. Traffic deaths were reported from the Carolinas
to New York. Two people were found dead of exposure in South Carolina. Hundreds
remained stranded in their cars along Interstate 85 in North Carolina after 2
feet of snow fell.
</P>

Hatch Ends Campaign, Endorses Bush
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Orrin Hatch dropped out of the presidential race
today and endorsed George W. Bush. Hatch abandoned the race after a last-place
finish in Monday's Iowa caucuses, where he received 1 percent of the Republican
votes.
</P>
<SUBHEAD>
Greenspan Goes Before Senators
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alan Greenspan vowed today that in a fourth term he would
promote greater openness at the traditionally secretive Federal Reserve and
pursue the central bank's traditional goal of keeping inflation from derailing
the economy. At his Senate confirmation hearing, Greenspan repeated his strong
preference that soaring federal surpluses be used to reduce the national debt.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices closed mostly lower today, as cautious
investors, fearing a pending interest rate hike, fled the technology sector
despite strong corporate earnings. The Dow Jones industrial average ended up
3.10 at 11,032.99. On the NYSE, gainers led losers 1,705-1,344. The Nasdaq was
at 4,069.91, down 97.50.

governor saying the GOP ``must be big enough to welcome'' dissenting views, and
the Arizona senator declining to repeat earlier comments suggesting he might

he said, ``we must welcome people from different persuasions into our party.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
	   Keyes, evidently unimpressed, turned to McCain and said in light of his
comments, ``how can we trust you'' to lead the country toward a ban on
abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, McCain, Keyes and their rivals, Gary Bauer and Steve Forbes, stood
behind identical podiums in a television studio in Manchester six days before
the nation's first primary. Their clash was the first half of an unusual debate
double-header. Democrats Al Gore and Bill Bradley were taking their turn later
in the evening in the same location.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP field was smaller by one. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, dropped out of
the race earlier in the day and said he was backing Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the first debate since Monday night's Iowa caucuses ratified Bush's
standing as front-runner, and gave Forbes bragging rights for a strong second
place showing.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes prodded Bush strongly on his record in Texas, citing a litany of what
he said was shortcomings in tax cuts, education and the size of government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So many half stories, so little time,'' Bush snapped, then pivoted to one
of his best issues, as judged in the polls -- his electibility. Voters in Texas
looked at his record and re-elected him in 1998, he said, adding that the Lone
Star state is a ``mighty important state'' for any Republican running for
president. Texas has 32 of the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the
White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer fielded a question from McCain about the impact of special interest
money, and turned it into an attack on his rivals. Mentioning U.S. policy toward
China, he said, ``I think some of you guys already are affected by some of these
big money contributions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No one has ever bought me and no one ever will,'' said Forbes, the heir to
a publishing fortune whose candidacy is largely self-funded.

<HEADLINE> Congro Talks Wind Down, No Pact  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Talks among Congo's warring countries began to wind
down Wednesday without any concrete new agreement to update the frayed
cease-fire but with a pledge from the Security Council to move onto the next
phase of shoring up the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   The 15-member council said in a statement adopted Wednesday that it intended
to move quickly to approve a resolution authorizing deployment of a U.N.
military observer mission to the Congo.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials had said before the talks began Monday that they hoped the
African leaders' visit would end with a concrete pledge to update missed
deadlines and other aspects of the peace deal they signed in July in Lusaka,
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
	   But U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke insisted the New York talks were on
track and said the fact that the presidents showed up at all was progress.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan took a similar positive outlook Wednesday. ``At
least each head of state who participated reaffirmed his support for the Lusaka
Accords,'' Annan said, adding that the issues now were ``clearer.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Obviously we shall have difficulties, but we are ready to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
	   Talks among the leaders were continuing privately, in their hotel rooms
around town, but no further formal meetings were planned at the United Nations,
which hosted a mini-summit on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations has recommended a mission of about 5,500 people be sent,
including 500 military observers, 3,400 security troops, and logistics,
communications and medical units.
</P>
<P>
	   The Security Council statement issued Wednesday, however, stopped short of
committing the members to sending in a full-fledged peacekeeping force as sought
by the seven African presidents who addressed the council in an open session on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Holbrooke told council ambassadors that the United States at this point
couldn't commit on paper to a peacekeeping force, council diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the United States has said it will support peacekeeping in Congo,
Holbrooke has said the time isn't yet right to approach the U.S. Congress for
authorization for a full-fledged force.
</P>
<P>
	   The council's statement represented the only real communique issued during
the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Rwanda and Uganda are supporting rebels who launched an insurrection in
August 1998 to topple Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
	   Kabila and his allies -- Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia -- signed a cease-fire
agreement with Rwanda and Uganda in July and the rebels signed on a month later.
</P>
<P>
	   But the agreement has been violated, with fresh offensives reported
Wednesday.

roared with approval. Elian's great-uncle Delfin Gonzalez faced the crowd while
holding a crucifix above his head.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Tomorrow they're going to make me an American citizen,'' Elian said in an
interview broadcast over the Spanish-language Radio Mambi while driving back to
his relatives' home.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers came to the United States last week to appeal to the
American people and Congress to send the boy back to his father in Cuba. Elian's
relatives in Miami want him to stay and are fighting a U.S. government order
sending him back.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department had said the grandmothers would see Elian privately,
with the boy's Florida relatives nearby in the house. Elian's father, in a
letter printed in the Communist Party newspaper Granma, asked to be included in
the reunion by telephone.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers had also flown to Miami on Monday but left town without
seeing Elian. The Miami relatives insisted that any reunion take place at their
home in the Little Havana neighborhood, but the grandmothers said they were
uncomfortable going there. Anti-Castro Cuban immigrants have been holding
protests around the home.
</P>
<P>
	   After long negotiations, the Justice Department ordered Elian's relatives to
bring him to the nun's house. The agency said it had the authority to do so
under the arrangement letting the boy stay in this country pending further
immigration proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   Mariela Quintana and Raquel Rodriguez had not seen their grandson since
before he left Cuba for the United States with his mother, who died along with
10 other people when their boat capsized. Elian was found clinging to an inner
tube off the Florida coast on Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
	   The reunion was held at the home of Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, president of
Barry University. O'Laughlin, 70, has a history of helping immigrants and had
said she would serve as ``welcomer'' and ``hugger.''
</P>
<P>
	   As the grandmothers drove up to the house, a few people tossed flowers at
their car. About 200 demonstrators were waiting outside the house; some cheered
and others booed as the grandmothers passed.
</P>
<P>
	   On Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott indicated he has no solid
plans for handling legislation next week to give Elian U.S. citizenship. That
would remove the boy from the jurisdiction of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, the agency that ordered him back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are a lot of extenuating circumstances,'' Lott said. ``Obviously it
could come up next week. But there are a lot of people looking at this issue and
there may be developments between now and then.''
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton supported the grandmothers' cause, hinting he might veto
the citizenship legislation if it passes. And senators seeking Elian's return to
Cuba suggested they might use delaying tactics to keep the Senate from debating
the measure.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers met with several members of Congress this week and asked
them not to pass such a bill. One of their supporters in the Senate, Connecticut
Democrat Christopher Dodd, said it was ``pathetic'' that Congress would get
involved in the life of a 6-year-old.	   ``We can have good families in bad
countries,'' he said. ``This is a good family.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite no prospect of taking Elian with them, his grandmothers were still
looking forward to the visit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know if I'll cry or if I'll laugh,'' Mrs. Rodriguez, Elian's
maternal grandmother, told CNN on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's Miami relatives say Elian wants to stay in the United States. The
grandmothers have said Elian has told them by telephone that he wants to return
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Spencer Eig, lead attorney for the Miami family, said Elian's great-uncles
wanted to meet with the grandmothers at O'Laughlin's house, but the women
refused.

<HEADLINE> Guards Face Inmate Attack Charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAWTHORNE, N.Y. (AP) -- Four veteran jail guards were arrested Wednesday and
charged with sexually attacking female inmates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These acts are acts of intimidation, degradation, humiliation and serious
abuse,'' District Attorney Jeanine Pirro said of the alleged activities at the
Westchester County Jail.
</P>
<P>
	   The charges include rape, sodomy, sexual abuse and official misconduct.
</P>
<P>
	   County Executive Andrew Spano said he was immediately banning male officers
from the 10 posts inside the women prisoners' living quarters. Any men currently
assigned there will be transferred to other positions at the jail.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These things are happening too often at the women's facility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation began last year when an inmate complained about one of the
guards, and her boyfriend wrote to authorities soon after. Investigators ``came
across information that seemed to indicate this was widespread,'' Spano said.
</P>
<P>
	   Each of the guards was released on $300,000 bail. The guards have between
nine and 12 years on the job.
</P>
<P>
	   The men were suspended with pay, but the pay will end within two days,
Correction Commissioner Rocco Pozzi said.

<HEADLINE> CBS Reporter's Tape Stolen in Haiti  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A man with a gun stole two tapes from a CBS News crew
filming in Haiti. It was the second time in 15 months that a U.S. television
crew has been threatened while reporting on the island.
</P>
<P>
	   No one was hurt, and the tapes were never recovered.
</P>
<P>
	   In October 1998, "Dateline NBC" correspondent Lea Thompson was robbed at
gunpoint by men who stole some of her tapes and notes.
</P>
<P>
	   Correspondent Rita Braver was reporting last week about a doctor who works
in a poor section of Port-au-Prince when she noticed a man approach a crew
member, Mario DeCarvalho.
</P>
<P>
	   She couldn't hear them, but it appeared the man wanted their tapes and
DeCarvalho gave away two. When she tried to follow the man to retrieve the
tapes, DeCarvalho told her the man had a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think they didn't like it that we were in their neighborhood," Braver
said. "They might have thought we were doing something unfavorable to someone
there."
</P>
<P>
	   They were in Haiti for a story that airs Sunday about the end of U.S.
military involvement there.
</P>
<P>
	   When DeCarvalho and some others went back to the neighborhood later to try
to get the tapes, one was empty and the other had only scenes of the
Port-au-Prince neighborhood that weren't crucial to the story, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. military pulled out of Haiti this month, ending a mission that
began with the 1994 U.S.-led invasion that restored elected government in this
Caribbean nation. Braver was doing a story for CBS's "Sunday Morning."
</P>
<P>
	   "People had so much hope when Americans came there five years ago," she
said. "They thought life would get better and, in fact, life hasn't gotten
better. I think there's just a level of frustration there."

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Step Around Abortion  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- George W. Bush and John McCain stepped gingerly
around the abortion issue Wednesday night in feisty campaign debate, the Texas
governor saying the GOP ``must be big enough to welcome'' dissenting views, and
the Arizona senator declining to repeat earlier comments suggesting he might
permit his own child to end a pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the GOP presidential front-runner, said ``every child born and unborn
should be protected in law and every child should be protected by life.'' Still,
he said, ``we must welcome people from different persuasions into our party.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, pressed on the issue by Alan Keyes, who opposes all abortions, said,
``I am proud of my pro-life record in public life and I will continue to
maintain it. Stern-faced, the Arizonan added, ``I will not draw my children into
this discussion.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes, evidently unimpressed, turned to McCain and said in light of his
comments, ``how can we trust you'' to lead the country toward a ban on
abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, McCain, Keyes and their rivals, Gary Bauer and Steve Forbes, stood
behind identical podiums in a television studio in Manchester six days before
the nation's first primary. Their clash was the first half of an unusual debate
double-header. Democrats Al Gore and Bill Bradley were taking their turn later
in the evening in the same location.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP field was smaller by one. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, dropped out of
the race earlier in the day and said he was backing Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the first debate since Monday night's Iowa caucuses ratified Bush's
standing as front-runner, and gave Forbes bragging rights for a strong second
place showing.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes prodded Bush strongly on his record in Texas, citing a litany of what
he said was shortcomings in tax cuts, education and the size of government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So many half stories, so little time,'' Bush snapped, then pivoted to one
of his best issues, as judged in the polls -- his electibility. Voters in Texas
looked at his record and re-elected him in 1998, he said, adding that the Lone
Star state is a ``mighty important state'' for any Republican running for
president. Texas has 32 of the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the
White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer fielded a question from McCain about the impact of special interest
money, and turned it into an attack on his rivals. Mentioning U.S. policy toward
China, he said, ``I think some of you guys already are affected by some of these
big money contributions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No one has ever bought me and no one ever will,'' said Forbes, the heir to
a publishing fortune whose candidacy is largely self-funded.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain leads Bush narrowly in most pre-primary polls, but the race appears
far from settled, particularly given Forbes' strong showing in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Given a chance to pose a question to Bush, the senator renewed a
campaign-long debate about tax cuts, declaring the front-runner's plan wouldn't
leave enough money left over for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush defended his approach, and said that under McCain's less generous tax
cut, money would stay in Washington and ``bigger government'' would be the
result. Bush has called for a cut totaling $483 billion over five years, and
McCain's proposed cut is about half that size.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Al Gore would have written your plan, Mr. senator,'' Bush said to his
rival.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said Bush was ``spinning like Bill Clinton,'' not a compliment, given
his earlier harsh criticism of the president.

<HEADLINE> Rams Shiver Through Practice  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ATLANTA (AP) -- The St. Louis Rams practiced Wednesday in helmets and shells
... and jackets, gloves, long johns, wool caps and thermal face warmers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's ridiculous," coach Dick Vermeil said after a 2 1-2-hour workout in
20-degree temperature at the Atlanta Falcons' practice site in nearby Suwanee.
"But there's nothing you can do about it except try to survive."
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams are accustomed to practicing indoors; the Falcons are building an
indoor facility, but it won't be finished until next year.
</P>
<P>
	   For now, the only indoor facility in the Atlanta area is the Georgia Dome,
site of Sunday's Super Bowl, and it's off limits to the Rams and the Tennessee
Titans - for now.
</P>
<P>
	   Vermeil said he hoped the NFL could work out something so each team could
share the dome for practice Thursday or Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm spoiled," he said. "I'm used to practicing with quickness and speed,
but the weather takes it out of you. Especially when the offense is between
periods. They chill down waiting for the next group. But you've just got to get
through it. It's hard to work like we normally work."
</P>
<P>
	   Equipment manager Todd Hewitt came prepared.
</P>
<P>
	   "I had close to 10,000 pounds of winter gear ready to go if we won," he
said. "We broke out everything."
</P>
<P>
	   Hewitt also rented six heat blowers that were stationed at the end of the
field. Between drills, most players stood or sat in front of the blowers warming
their hands and legs.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the workout began, linebacker Todd Collins had hot air blown into his
helmet to soften the padding.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's an old New England trick," Collins said, referring to his days with
the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
	   A few players seemed oblivious to the weather. Tight end Roland Williams and
offensive guard Cameron Spikes were in shorts and offensive lineman Andy
McCollum wore the usual pants with the bottom part of the leg exposed.
</P>
<P>
	   The high Wednesday was 33, barely above freezing and 14 degrees below
average. Lows were expected to be near 10 overnight, and there was a winter
storm watch for Friday. On Saturday, the forecast was for snow and freezing
rain.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the conditions, quarterback Kurt Warner was sharp.
</P>
<P>
	   "He threw extremely well," assistant head coach Mike White said.
</P>
<P>
	   Defensive end Grant Wistrom (bruised shoulder) and wide receiver Torry Holt
(ribs, shoulder) were held out as a precaution but both were expected to
practice Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Unless they're frozen," Vermeil said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls Starr Probe 'Bogus'  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the eve of his last State of the Union address,
President Clinton said Wednesday the independent counsel investigation that
shadowed most of his presidency was ``bogus,'' but he apologized anew for the
Monica Lewinsky debacle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``First of all, I made one mistake. I apologized for it, I paid a high price
for it and I've done my best to atone for it by being a good president,''
Clinton said in a television interview.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But I believe we also endured what history will clearly record was a bogus
investigation, where there was nothing to Whitewater or these other charges.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton asserted that Republicans in Congress used the six-year Whitewater
investigation as a political cudgel, even when they knew neither Clinton nor
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton had done anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They knew it was a bunch of bull. They had no evidence,'' Clinton said in
an interview with PBS host Jim Lehrer. The interview was taped at the White
House Wednesday afternoon and broadcast Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
	   Without naming names, Clinton said one Republican senator admitted as much
in a private conversation during the Whitewater hearings begun in 1995 by
then-New York Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He said, 'Of course you didn't do anything wrong. That's not the purpose
of this,''' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president contended that a little distance from the Kenneth Starr
investigation has borne out his side of the argument.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now rational retrospectives are beginning to come out where people that
have no connection to me (are) talking about what an abuse of power it was and
what a threat to the American system it was,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   After speaking hopefully of his record of economic expansion and smaller
advances in health care and other areas, Clinton said he ultimately cannot
control how his presidency is recorded for history.
</P>
<P>
	   And in an awkward exchange, Clinton said he does not know whether he might
have avoided impeachment had he been more forthcoming with Lehrer once before.
</P>
<P>
	   Lehrer interviewed Clinton two years ago, just as the Lewinsky scandal was
breaking. In his first public remarks on the scandal, Clinton then roundly
denied any improper relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern
whose story of White House sexual encounters with Clinton ultimately led to his
impeachment in the House and acquittal in the Senate last year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The thing I regret most -- except for doing the wrong thing -- is
misleading the American people about it,'' Clinton said. ``I do not regret the
fact that I fought the independent counsel.''

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Hire Campo As Head Coach  </HEADLINE>
    By JAIME ARON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Dave Campo was hired Wednesday as head coach of the
Dallas Cowboys, putting a low-profile guy into one of the highest-profile jobs
in pro sports.
</P>
<P>
	   Campo, the Cowboys' defensive coordinator since 1995, has been with the team
since Jerry Jones bought it in 1989. Campo is among the group of assistant
coaches Jimmy Johnson brought with him from the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel like I'm family in this organization," Campo said.
</P>
<P>
	   He's only the fifth coach the Cowboys have ever had and, like the other
four, he's a first-time NFL head coach. His predecessor, Chan Gailey, is the
only one who didn't win a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas hasn't been a contender for championships lately. The Cowboys have
won only one playoff game since the last title in 1995 and they're 24-24 in the
past three seasons with two first-round playoff losses.
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas was 8-8 last year, mainly because of problems on offense. Campo's
unit allowed just 13 points in four of the losses, which is why he believes a
quick turnaround is possible.
</P>
<P>
	   "I could quote a lot of statistics here, but let me give you just one: The
Tennessee Titans were 8-8 last year and they're playing in the Super Bowl," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Campo, 52, was given a five-year contract worth $800,000 to $1 million per
season. That's the same length as Gailey's deal, but for more money.
</P>
<P>
	   Gailey also was the offensive coordinator, but Jones said Campo won't wear
two hats. New offensive and defensive coordinators could be hired as soon as
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   New England quarterbacks coach Jack Reilly, who had the same job in Dallas
in 1997, is the front-runner to lead the offense. The top candidate for the
defensive job is secondary coach Mike Zimmer. Campo spent six seasons overseeing
the secondary before becoming coordinator.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones' 15-day search for a coach hardly extended outside team headquarters,
but he described it Wednesday as "a thorough, thorough decision on my part."
</P>
<P>
	   He said the decision was between Campo and special teams coach Joe Avezzano.
</P>
<P>
	   Cowboys followers know Avezzano as a vein-bulging screamer who stalks the
sidelines. Less is known about Campo because he spent the last five years
working from the coaches box.
</P>
<P>
	   But players say Campo -- whose small size, glasses and graying blonde hair
make him look more like a college professor than a coach -- can be just as
fiery.
</P>
<P>
	   "He may only be 5-6 or 5-7, but he really gets after guys," safety Darren
Woodson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Campo's long relationship with Jones should come in handy considering the
authority the owner-general manager wields.
</P>
<P>
	   "Jerry and I have the same philosophy and that's to win the Super Bowl,"
Campo said. "We've been together and we know how we each think. I think that
makes it a little easier."
</P>
<P>
	   Campo and kicking coordinator Steve Hoffman are the only coaches remaining
from Johnson's initial staff.
</P>
<P>
	   Campo is the fourth member of the Class of '89 to become an NFL head coach,
joining Dave Shula, Norv Turner and Dave Wannstedt. Butch Davis, who was
defensive coordinator after Wannstedt and before Campo, is the head coach at the
University of Miami.

<HEADLINE> GM To Merge Car, Truck Operations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. will merge its North American car and
truck operations into engineering groups in a move designed to save money and
mirror the blending of passenger vehicle types.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of having separate North American engineering groups for cars and
trucks, GM will have one group to handle vehicle engineering and another group
to handle manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
	   The changes will not cause any layoffs among the 60,500 employed by the Car
Group and the 45,000 people working in the Truck Group, although some people
might be reassigned or not replaced if their jobs are deemed unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
	   "This supports our global product strategy to be fast and flexible to retain
customers and attract new ones," Ron Zarrella, President of GM North America,
said in a statement "The convergence of North American Engineering and
Manufacturing responds to market trends as our product portfolio comprehends
all-new crossover vehicles that are emerging between traditional cars, trucks,
sport utilities and vans."
</P>
<P>
	   GM spokesman Dan Flores said it was not known who would head the new groups.
GM Senior Vice President Donald E. Hackworth runs the Car Group, while GM Group
Vice President Thomas J. Davis runs the Truck Group.

<HEADLINE> More steps taken to reduce waiting times at inspection stations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman on Wednesday announced steps
she hopes will finally reduce chronically long waiting times at about half of
the state's 32 centralized car inspection centers - at a taxpayer cost of up to
$12 million.
<P>
	   Under fire for car inspection troubles that will prompt several
investigations, Whitman and Department of Transportation Commissioner James
Weinstein ordered officials to use the old tailpipe tests and return to the old
way of gathering information about cars to reduce waiting times at 15 DMV
inspection stations that have had the worst problems.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor also said the state will chip in about $25 per inspection to
private garages to help convince motorists to use the corner station and stay
away from Division of Motor Vehicles stations. And motorists whose inspection
stickers expire Monday - the last day in January - will now have until the end
of February to get their cars inspected.
</P>
<P>
	   At 17 other centralized stations that have not been trouble spots, however,
the tougher auto emissions test that was suspended on Monday will return Jan.
31, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The moves once again were pitched as ways to buy time while Parsons
Infrastructure and Technology, the private contractor the Whitman administration
hired to a seven-year, $400 million contract, attempts to fix problems that have
prompted long waiting times at many DMV stations. The enhanced inspections are
part of the state's effort to meet federal goals to clean the air.
</P>
<P>
	   "The goal is to get the pressure off the central inspection system, which is
not working the way it should be working, to give Parsons Infrastructure the
time to make the changes that they need to make," said Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
	   Lines at centralized DMV stations have been long since the state's vendor
instituted a tougher safety and emissions testing system on Dec. 13. Whitman has
criticized Parsons for the delays, but the company says the state is partly to
blame for computer glitches because it kept changing its software demands.
</P>
<P>
	   After a newspaper asked for memos showing that a subcontractor had
continually warned such problems would occur, Whitman ordered an attorney
general's review of why those warnings were not heeded. The State Commission of
Investigation and Senate President Donald DiFrancesco also expect to probe
issues surrounding the state's award of the contract to Parsons.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman said she believes the steps "are going to relieve motorists of the
immediate problem of having to wait in inordinate lines. We believe this
targeted approach will relieve much of the frustration being experienced by
motorists."
</P>
<P>
	   The most expensive move involves the state's private garages. Beginning
Monday, the state will subsidize inspections at private garages by $25 per
inspection, if the garage owners pass the savings on to motorists. State
officials want more motorists to use private garages for inspections to remove
pressure from the centralized lanes. However, fewer motorists are using the
stations, largely because they now cost an average of $75 because the new
testing equipment was so expensive.

	   Parsons last week offered to subsidize inspections at private garages by
$10, if garage owners also chipped in $10. Officials on Wednesday, however, said
many stations have not signed up for this program, which expires at the end of
March. Motorists can conceivably save a total of $45 on inspections at stations
that have signed up for this program.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman estimated that the state subsidies to the private stations could
total $10 million to $12 million by the end of June. The money will come from a
fund backed by DMV fees. The dollar figure is about half what the state would
pay Parsons during the same time period, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   At 15 DMV problem spots around the state, the state will go back to the old
ways to reduce waiting times.
</P>
<P>
	   The changes are expected to reduce a test that now takes about 15 minutes to
one that will average five to six minutes, officials said. The stations that
will revert to the old system are Bakers Basin, Cape May, Cherry Hill,
Eatontown, Lodi, Newark, Paramus, Randolph, Ridgewood, Washington, Wayne,
Westfield, Salem, Bridgeton and Montclair.
</P>
<P>
	   The state will use the old tailpipe test instead of the enhanced emissions
test, which looks for smog compounds blamed on the state's high asthma rates.
The centers will revert to an old credentialing procedure where workers punch
tickets rather than use scanners to gather information. And once the tests are
completed, far less information will be punched into computers for
record-keeping.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're going back to a much more simplified system to analyze (the data),"
said Carl Golden, spokesman for Parsons. "They wanted to take a huge amount of
data, which took a lot of time."
</P>
<P>
	   Golden said Parsons and state officials will make "substantial changes in
software" to streamline this data collection system.

<HEADLINE> Football? Feels Like Winter Olympics  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL NEWBERRY AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Hands shivering, Chris Sanders carefully lifted the
steaming, Styrofoam cup to his lips.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't even drink coffee," said the Tennessee Titans receiver, trying
futilely to get warm. "I am today."
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, this is the year they held the Super Bowl in Atlanta -- and the
Winter Olympics broke out.
</P>
<P>
	   The teams arrived Monday, shortly after an ice storm paralyzed much of the
metro area. That was followed by a jolt of unseasonably cold weather -- some 20
degrees below normal for this time of year in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   Making matters worse, Tennessee's media functions were held in a giant tent
outside the team's luxury hotel. Attempts at heating the temporary structure
were futile on a 26-degree morning, with a wind chill of minus 8.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought they would have heat in here," Titans tight end Larry Brown said,
huddled at a table with a hood covering his head. "Oh, man, it's freezing."
</P>
<P>
	   The St. Louis Rams were more fortunate. They met with reporters in a large
ballroom within their suburban hotel, prompting several players to show up in
short-sleeved T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
	   All-Pro tackle Orlando Pace winced when told of the Titans' arrangements.
This being the NFL, however, there was no room for pity.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm just happy we're in this cozy situation," Pace said.
</P>
<P>
	   By afternoon, he wasn't feeling so warm. Both teams had to practice outside
-- the Titans at Georgia Tech, the Rams at the Atlanta Falcons' complex in
suburban Suwanee -- and the mercury climbed to only 33 degrees with gusty winds.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's ridiculous," Rams coach Dick Vermeil complained. "But there's nothing
you can do about it except try to survive."
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis practiced in winter jackets, gloves, thermal underwear, wool caps
and thermal neck and face warmers. Equipment manager Todd Hewitt rented six heat
blowers, stationing them at the end of the practice field. Between drills, most
players huddled around the blowers like moths drawn to light.
</P>
<P>
	   The only indoor facility in the area is the Georgia Dome, site of Sunday's
game. But the arena was set aside Wednesday and Thursday for rehearsing the
pre-game and halftime shows.
</P>
<P>
	   Temperatures were expected to climb above freezing on Thursday and the Dome
will be available the following day if conditions worsen, NFL spokesman Greg
Aiello said. The forecast called for possible snow -- that's right, snow.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's just an unfortunate circumstance that no one has any control over,"
Aiello said. "This is a very unusual weather pattern."
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans used up the ballroom space within their hotel for other team
functions, so the tent was set up in the parking lot, said Jim Steeg, vice
president of special events. The NFL has used similar arrangements at other --
albeit warmer, much warmer -- cities in recent years.
</P>
<P>
	   Steeg said 12 additional heaters will be brought in Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Back home, both teams have indoor practice facilities, but the Titans used
theirs only twice this season. Coach Jeff Fisher favors working outside on grass
and said the cold weather didn't affect Wednesday's practice.
</P>
<P>
	   Vermeil, on the other hand, wanted to practice inside, but was informed by
the league that it wasn't a possibility at the dome.
</P>
<P>
	   "All they told us," he said, "is there's 2,000 people decorating the dance
floor."
</P>
<P>
	   Spectacle over sport.
</P>
<P>
	   Titans quarterback Steve McNair, vapor rolling off his lips with every word,
wasn't looking forward to spending the rest of the week on a frozen practice
field.
</P>
<P>
	   "If it's this cold, I don't want to be outside," McNair said. "But it's
something we're going to have to deal with."
</P>
<P>
	   His teammates focused on getting warm. Good luck.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wish I had five jackets on, it's so cold out here," said Sanders, who
wore a flimsy jacket to the news conference in the tent. "It feels like Alaska."
</P>
<P>
	   Guard Jason Layman showed up in a short-sleeved T-shirt, then sat rigidly at
a table with his arms crossed, his hands clasping his bare elbows.
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps trying to determine if Layman was frozen, a teammate asked, "Why
aren't you wearing a jacket?"
</P>
<P>
	   Layman, slowly coming to life, replied, "I thought this was inside."
</P>
<P>
	   Defensive tackle Kenny Holmes went shopping Tuesday after hearing the
weather forecast, purchasing an insulated coat and matching pants. He was the
first player to arrive at the frigid tent and looked downright toasty in his new
duds.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a must have," Holmes said, looking like he was ready for a day on
the slopes. "I think I need to pick up another one."
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta officials don't think the frosty conditions will have a negative
impact on the city's chances of playing host to another Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   "The game is inside. Most of the events are inside. The hotels are inside,"
said Adam Leish, spokesman for the Metro Atlanta Super Bowl XXXIV Host
Committee. "The weather is not a factor from our perspective."
</P>
<P>
	   Of course, it must be noted that temperatures were much balmier Wednesday in
the next two Super Bowl cities: 53 in Tampa, 64 in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't want to bash Atlanta," Rams receiver Torry Holt said. "But I would
like to go somewhere where it's nice and warm."
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans, whose home has been Houston, Memphis and Nashville in the past
four years, weren't going to let anything ruin their first Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've been dealing with adversity, we've been dealing with all this other
junk for years," offensive lineman Brad Hopkins said. "Cold weather at the Super
Bowl is certainly not going to hinder us."

<HEADLINE> Elian Family Asked To Join Meeting  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's father asked to be included by telephone in
the boy's Wednesday meeting with his grandmothers in Miami Beach and asked that
the child's great-uncle not be permitted in the gathering.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter from Juan Miguel Gonzalez and Elian's two grandfathers and his
great-grandmother was printed in Wednesday's edition of the Communist Party
daily Granma.
</P>
<P>
	   They said that after the meeting, they would like Elian's grandmothers,
Mariela Quintana and Raquel Rodriguez, to return to Washington for more meetings
with lawmakers in their fight to prevent Congress from giving Elian U.S.
citizenship against his father's will.
</P>
<P>
	   In the letter, Elian's Cuban relatives asked that the grandmothers bring a
cellular phone to their two-hour meeting with the boy and asked that the
gathering be extended for a third hour with the relatives in Cuba participating
by telephone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to talk to the boy there when he is entirely free with you,'' the
letter said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1 1/2-hour meeting ended Wednesday night and it wasn't clear whether the
boy had spoken with his family in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter also asked that the boy's Miami relatives, including Elian's
great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez, not be allowed in the meeting and that there be no
media access.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter said it was ``unfortunate'' that the media and the Cuban exile
community already knew where the meeting was being held and begged that there be
no ``cameras, protests or circus'' outside.
</P>
<P>
	   The relatives in Elian's hometown of Cardenas, about a two-hour drive east
of Havana, said it was fine with them if the grandmothers met with other
relatives in Miami who reportedly support returning Elian to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, hundreds of farmers gathered in an auditorium at the
Revolutionary Armed Forces headquarters in Havana in the latest in a series of
government-organized protests calling for the child's return to his homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   Wearing straw hats and waving paper red, white and blue Cuban flags, the
farmers praised Fidel Castro's government and called for ``our Elian'' to be
reunited with his father on the communist island.
</P>
<P>
	   The Castro government has scheduled a much larger demonstration on Friday,
the anniversary of the birth of Cuban independence hero Jose Marti.

<HEADLINE> Government Denies Firing at Waco  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- Lawyers for Branch Davidians who are suing the government
over the 1993 Waco raid complained Wednesday that the government's denial of
gunfire by federal agents is still incomplete.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys representing the Defense Department and the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms this week formally denied that anyone in federal law
enforcement or the active-duty military fired on the Davidians on April 19,
1993.
</P>
<P>
	   The denial came Monday as an answer to questions by the plaintiffs' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
	   The plaintiffs, whose wrongful-death lawsuit goes to trial in mid-May,
contend that infrared surveillance footage shot by the FBI on the final day of
the siege proves that government agents fired on the Davidians' compound as it
burned. At least 80 Branch Davidians died in the inferno.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department in September said FBI agents fired no shots, but it
omitted references to military personnel or other federal agents.
</P>
<P>
	   This week, the department added sworn statements by ATF and Defense
Department lawyers denying gunfire by personnel in their agencies.
</P>
<P>
	   The Treasury Department, which is the ATF's parent, said ``to the best of
our knowledge, information and belief'' no one employed by Treasury or under its
``supervision, direction or control'' fired on the Branch Davidians on April 19.
</P>
<P>
	   The Defense Department, which acknowledges members of its elite Delta Force
were on the scene during the 51-day siege in an observational role, made a
similar statement ``based on currently available information.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why can't they answer that question flat out `yes' or `no'? No qualifiers.
No conditions. No loopholes or escape clauses,'' said Michael Caddell, an
attorney for the plaintiffs. ``If you don't have enough information to answer it
after six and a half years, when are you going to get it?''
</P>
<P>
	   Caddell said he will ask a judge to again order the government to answer the
question.
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon spokesman Jim Turner said the Defense Department will ``provide our
definitive answer to this question once we have had an opportunity to interview
all relevant DOD witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice and Treasury departments offered no immediate comment.

<HEADLINE> McNair Practices Despite Toe Injury  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ATLANTA (AP) -- Steve McNair took part in the Tennessee Titans' first
practice for the Super Bowl on Wednesday despite an aching left toe, while
receiver Yancey Thigpen didn't work out in the bitter cold but still hopes to
play.
</P>
<P>
	   Coach Jeff Fisher had described Thigpen's status as doubtful Wednesday
morning. But the receiver, who has a hairline fracture in his right foot, was
listed as questionable in the team's official injury report in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll see how he improves during the week and then make our decision on
Sunday," Fisher said after a two-hour practice at Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
	   McNair is listed as questionable and has been wearing a plastic brace on his
left foot to protect his case of turf toe. But he took "65 to 75 percent" of the
snaps during practice.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was encouraged by Steve's work," Fisher said. "It's about what we
expected."
</P>
<P>
	   The only player who definitely will not play Sunday in the Super Bowl is
free safety Marcus Robertson. He broke a bone above his left ankle in the AFC
championship.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Step Around Abortion  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- George W. Bush and John McCain stepped gingerly
around the abortion issue Wednesday night in feisty campaign debate, the Texas
governor saying the GOP ``must be big enough to welcome'' dissenting views, and
the Arizona senator declining to repeat earlier comments suggesting he might
permit his own child to end a pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the GOP presidential front-runner, said ``every child born and unborn
should be protected in law and every child should be protected by life.'' Still,
he said, ``we must welcome people from different persuasions into our party.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, pressed on the issue by Alan Keyes, who opposes all abortions, said,
``I am proud of my pro-life record in public life and I will continue to
maintain it. Stern-faced, the Arizonan added, ``I will not draw my children into
this discussion.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes, evidently unimpressed, turned to McCain and said in light of his
comments, ``how can we trust you'' to lead the country toward a ban on
abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, McCain, Keyes and their rivals, Gary Bauer and Steve Forbes, stood
behind identical podiums in a television studio in Manchester six days before
the nation's first primary. Their clash was the first half of an unusual debate
double-header. Democrats Al Gore and Bill Bradley were taking their turn later
in the evening in the same location.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP field was smaller by one. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, dropped out of
the race earlier in the day and said he was backing Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the first debate since Monday night's Iowa caucuses ratified Bush's
standing as front-runner, and gave Forbes bragging rights for a strong second
place showing.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes prodded Bush strongly on his record in Texas, citing a litany of what
he said was shortcomings in tax cuts, education and the size of government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So many half stories, so little time,'' Bush snapped, then pivoted to one
of his best issues, as judged in the polls -- his electibility. Voters in Texas
looked at his record and re-elected him in 1998, he said, adding that the Lone
Star state is a ``mighty important state'' for any Republican running for
president. Texas has 32 of the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the
White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer fielded a question from McCain about the impact of special interest
money, and turned it into an attack on his rivals. Mentioning U.S. policy toward
China, he said, ``I think some of you guys already are affected by some of these
big money contributions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No one has ever bought me and no one ever will,'' said Forbes, the heir to
a publishing fortune whose candidacy is largely self-funded.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain leads Bush narrowly in most pre-primary polls, but the race appears
far from settled, particularly given Forbes' strong showing in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Given a chance to pose a question to Bush, the senator renewed a
campaign-long debate about tax cuts, declaring the front-runner's plan wouldn't
leave enough money left over for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush defended his approach, and said that under McCain's less generous tax
cut, money would stay in Washington and ``bigger government'' would be the
result. Bush has called for a cut totaling $483 billion over five years, and
McCain's proposed cut is about half that size.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Al Gore would have written your plan, Mr. senator,'' Bush said to his
rival.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said Bush was ``spinning like Bill Clinton,'' not a compliment, given
his earlier harsh criticism of the president.
</P>
<P>
	   Abortion came up in the opening moments of the debate, when Bush was asked
what two-sentence change he would make in the Constitution if he could write an
amendment.
</P>
<P>
	   He said every child ``born and unborn'' should be protected by law. Bush
said he is a ``pro-life'' individual, but made no attempt to call for the repeal
of the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe it's important for the next president to recognize that good
people can disagree on this issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue is a tricky one politically, in part because independents can vote
in either primary in New Hampshire and McCain, in particular, is hoping to gain
a significant amount of his support from them.
</P>
<P>
	   Beyond that, Bush's campaign is based on a theme of ``compassionate
conservatism,'' and he is hoping at the very least to avoid offending moderate
voters who do not agree with the strongly anti-abortion Republican platform.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate opportunity for any of Bush's rivals to press him on
abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes went after McCain, who had earlier in the day told reporters that if
his teen-age daughter became pregnant, it would be a ``family decision,'' that
he, his wife and their child would reach.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes raised the issue, and McCain responded that he alone among the men on
the stage had cast ``pro-life'' votes in the Senate over the past 17 years.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who was a Vietnam prisoner of war, returned to the issue on his own
more than 30 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've seen enough killing in my life. I know how precious human life is.
And I don't need a lecture from you,'' he said to Keyes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I didn't lecture you, Senator McCain,'' Keyes said. '' I simply pointed
out your answer showed no understanding of the moral principle involved in
abortion.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day, Bush focused on laying out his plan for using the budget
surplus to cut taxes, reduce the national debt and shore up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   Other candidates said the debate would be an important one, drawing more
interest with the primary less than a week away.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think people will be watching who perhaps weren't watching before
because of the proximity of the vote,'' said McCain. But he had had to spend
much of the day clarifying his anti-abortion stance.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, in the hours before the debate, was talking about the 30 percent he
won in the Iowa caucuses Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We started to get (a mandate) in Iowa. I hope we can get it going here,''
Forbes said while campaigning in Nashua.
</P>
<P>
	   Abortion, which played a substantial role in Monday's Iowa caucuses, with
the strong impact of the Christian right, is less significant as a political
factor in New Hampshire. There are more independents than either registered
Republicans or Democrats here.
</P>
<P>
	   But the issue took center stage again earlier Wednesday when McCain, who
leads Bush in most New Hampshire polls this week, was asked by a reporter
whether he would stop his 15-year-old daughter from undergoing the procedure.
</P>
<P>
	   After first saying it would be her decision, McCain, whose home state has a
parental consent law for minors, clarified his position.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The family decision will be made by the family,'' he said, and not by his
daughter alone. McCain has repeatedly said he opposes abortion, believes that
life begins at conception and supports a requirement of parental consent.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue has shadowed the candidates throughout the campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Previously, Bush, who has faced frequent questions about the strength of his
anti-abortion convictions, was asked a slightly different question -- what he
would do if one of his relatives faced such a decision because of rape. ``It
would be up to her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes on Wednesday attacked McCain's comments as too weak. He said neither
the Arizona senator nor Bush could succeed as the GOP's presidential nominee
because neither man can articulate an acceptable position on the thorny issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They don't have it in their hearts, they don't have it in their minds.
They haven't thought it through,'' Keyes said in Manchester.

<HEADLINE> McCain Gets Personal on Abortion  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Sen. John McCain said Wednesday it would be a
``family decision'' to make if his teen-age daughter were contemplating an
abortion, a political question posed in such personal terms that the GOP
presidential hopeful and his wife expressed concern about the impact on their
child.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain first said that the ``final decision'' on ending a pregnancy would be
made by his daughter, 15. An hour later, he contacted reporters with a
clarification: ``I misspoke,'' he said. ``The family decision will be made by
the family, not by'' his daughter alone, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Later yet, he said, ``It's a family decision, not her decision and that's
pro-life,'' he said. ``Cindy (his wife) and I will make that decision.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain grew testy when reporters continued to press him during the day.
``What's the matter with you, sir,'' he said at one point. ``I've answered your
question, sir.''
</P>
<P>
	   He declined to answer when asked what would happen if his daughter became
pregnant as the result of rape or incest.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a 15-year-old daughter,'' Cindy McCain said when the question was
asked, before abruptly moving away from reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said his wife, who was traveling on his campaign bus at the time,
would call their daughter at school in Arizona to talk to her about why her name
might be in the news. ``I do worry, understandably, about my 15-year-old
daughter. I hope this won't have an impact on her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The abortion issue has flared in recent days, as the GOP presidential field
moves through the opening round of primaries and caucuses. Front-runner George
W. Bush, pressed repeatedly last week, said the Supreme Court's 1973 ruling
legalizing abortion usurped rights properly belonging to the states, and the
individual legislatures should be able to decide what restrictions, if any, to
place on abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservatives Steve Forbes, Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes are firmly opposed to
abortion, and favor overturning the court's decision.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My daughter has been raised to believe that that's God's decision, and
that it's already been made,'' Keyes said Wednesday. ``And, therefore, I have no
fear of what she would do.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and McCain, while both expressing opposition to abortion, have adopted
more nuanced positions, apparently in hopes of broadening their political
appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has adopted a highly unusual campaign style, spending long hours on a
chartered bus in New Hampshire in close proximity to reporters, often bantering
good-naturedly and rarely refusing to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
	   A reporter aboard his ``Straight Talk Express'' campaign bus first posed the
question: If his 15-year-old daughter became pregnant and believed that she
wasn't ready to bear a child, would McCain block her from getting an abortion?
</P>
<P>
	   ``No,'' the Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue dogged McCain throughout the day and followed him to the
Republican candidates' final debate before the Feb. 1 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How can you take the position that you would subject such a choice to a
family conference or any other human choice?'' Keyes asked McCain during the
broadcast. ``Isn't it God's choice that protects the life of that child in the
womb?''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain stood his ground. ``I will not draw my children into this
discussion,'' he replied. Later, he fired back at Keyes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've seen enough killing in my life,'' said McCain, a decorated Vietnam
War veteran and former prisoner of war. ``I know how precious human life is, and
I don't need a lecture from you.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked back on the bus whether his comments amounted to an abortion rights
viewpoint, McCain said: ``I don't think it's the choice position to say that my
daughter and my wife and I will discuss something that is a family matter and
that we have to decide.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pressed on the matter, McCain, clearly irritated, shot back: ``I'm not gonna
talk about what I'm gonna do with my daughter in the most personal and painful
kind of situation that I can imagine outside of a terminal illness.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator has said he believes life begins at conception and that
he opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest and when the mother's life
is in danger. He pointed out that he has consistently voted against abortion
during his 17-year congressional career. McCain also supports parental
notification, a law on the books in Arizona where his family lives.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has stumbled over the abortion issue before.
</P>
<P>
	   In August, he surprised his staff and angered anti-abortion allies by
appearing to suggest that he would oppose repealing Roe vs. Wade, the 1973
Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   Under pressure, McCain tried to clarify his views with written statements
saying he favors working to overturn the ruling while trying to reduce abortions
through adoptions, counseling and other efforts. Whenever McCain is asked about
the issue at town hall meetings, he says he wants to reduce the polarizing
nature of the debate by encouraging both sides to work together on issues to
which they agree, such as improving adoption and foster care systems.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants Green Fuel Tax Credit  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will propose a $2.1 billion tax credit
plan to encourage development and production of environmentally friendly fuels,
White House officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The 10-year tax incentive package will be part of Clinton's budget proposal
for 2001, which he will deliver to Congress next month. The tax credits are in
addition to a proposed $243 million budget increase for developing technologies
that turn trees, plants and animal waste into energy and environmentally
friendly products.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton will ask Congress for a total of $439 million to fund research and
grants to aid the production of ``bioenergy'' and other products, such as
plastics and chemicals, from agricultural waste.
</P>
<P>
	   The tax credits would help businesses and entrepreneurs find ways to use
existing technology to turn things like crushed sugar cane into usable fuel,
said Roger Ballantine, who heads the White House office on global climate
change.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are trying to move away from this notion that in order to deal with
climate change we're going to have to make tough economic choices,'' Ballantine
said. ``The president rejects that,'' and believes that the world can turn
toward cleaner fuel and not risk economic backsliding, Ballantine said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan follows an August executive order creating an interagency council
to promote bio-technologies and reduce U.S. oil demand and protect the
environment.
</P>
<P>
	   It would go beyond the $196 million program Congress approved this year for
similar initiatives.

<HEADLINE> Collins unofficially makes it known he wants to run for governor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - It's unofficially official: Jack Collins wants to
be the next governor of New Jersey.
<P>
	   Collins has amassed substantial political influence as the longest serving
Assembly Speaker in the Republican-controlled Statehouse. He said Wednesday he
will now venture beyond its walls to see if he can attract the kind of support
he feels he must get from party leaders and ordinary residents before committing
himself officially to a campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am very interested in it. I am going to pursue the idea aggressively, and
do anticipate that will happen, but of course I do not have to make a final
decision until next year," Collins said. "I am going to pursue this with the
intention of becoming a candidate. It would have to be something I find out I
don't want to do to stop me."
</P>
<P>
	   "Very honestly, I don't know what could dissuade me. My family is very aware
of what's involved," Collins added. "If everybody in the state said I can't win,
then maybe I wouldn't run. But I don't expect to see that."
</P>
<P>
	   Collins joins his counterpart in the upper house, Republican Senate
President Donald DiFrancesco, who has all but formally announced his intention
to seek the governorship in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins paid DiFrancesco a courtesy call Monday to share with him his
intention to go public. DiFrancesco on Wednesday said it is something the two of
them had discussed over the course of the past year and he hardly regards it as
a surprise.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, DiFrancesco said he would be a full-fledged Collins supporter were
it not for his own interest in the seat.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins said part of his exploratory work would be to recruit fund-raising
experts and perhaps to form a political issues committee that permits him to
begin raising cash for political promotions.
</P>
<P>
	   "What I am going to do is pretty much what the Senate president has been
doing for a while, and that is to tour around the state even more than I have as
speaker, to talk with people," Collins said.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins has drawn attention to his independent streak lately with a school
construction proposal that would only pay 90 percent of the costs for new
schools in the state's poorest urban districts. Whitman and DiFrancesco have
said they believe 100 percent funding has been ordered by the state Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins said he was not trying to attract attention, but was merely carrying
out his firm belief that the deal between the Whitman administration's lawyers
and the Supreme Court failed to take into account the proper role of the
Legislature as a separate branch of government.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins also said he does not believe his antiabortion views will damage his
appeal to the state's mainstream, with a majority of Republicans supposedly
endorsing abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think too many people look at candidates and try to put them in a slot,
and then tell people where they are. I don't think people think that way,"
Collins said.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins said he believes the U.S. Supreme Court was wrong to legalize
abortion, but that after 14 years in government life he has learned to focus on
narrower proposals like a requirement for minors to notify their parents before
getting an abortion. "We have been able to accomplish some things that New
Jersey citizens seem to think was right that can be called pro-life," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins, 56, has retired from Rowan University as an administrator and a
professor of graduate educational law. He has a masters in education and in 1982
got a law degree but confined his legal work to teaching. He is married with
four children and three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Democratic side of the 2001 race, Woodbridge mayor Jim McGreevey and
former Morris County prosecutor Michael Murphy appear to be setting the stage
for a rematch of their 1997 primary contest for the nomination to run for
governor.
</P>
<P>
	   McGreevey won that primary in the three-way race with Murphy and U.S. Rep.
Rob Andrews, D-Haddon Heights, who has since more or less vanished from the
state political scene. McGreevey in the general election lost to Whitman by
fewer than 26,000 votes out of 2.3 million votes cast.

<HEADLINE> Debate Notebook  </HEADLINE>
   By ANN S. KIM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Alan Keyes didn't miss a beat when a couple of
questions came at him Wednesday -- in French.
</P>
<P>
	   Marcel Calfat of Radio-Canada, the French service of the Canadian
Broadcasting Corp., had read that Keyes could speak French. ``You never know
what they put in those bios,'' he said. ``I wanted to check it out.''
</P>
<P>
	   Calfat asked Keyes, a former U.S. representative to a United Nations
committee, about the North American Free Trade Agreement. Keyes, in French, said
he isn't opposed to it in principle, but that it may need to be re-evaluated.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes answered another question in French about the message he wants to send
to New Hampshire voters. ``The message is very simple. I represent moral
priorities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How many languages can you do that in?'' another reporter asked.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What I just did I can probably only do in French,'' Keyes said. ``I would
have broken down much sooner in Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
	   How well did Keyes do?
</P>
<P>
	   ``A lot more articulate, in fact, than some Canadian politicians,'' Calfat
said. French and English are the official languages of Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   The reporter said he hasn't had a chance to check out the other candidates.
``But Bradley's wife is supposed to speak French,'' he said. ``She's my next
victim.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   The candidates were far from the only ones with their competitive juices
flowing before the Wednesday night debates.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Williams, a Texan helping John McCain, said he and another volunteer
showed up outside the WMUR-TV studio at 5 a.m. to begin putting up more than 400
signs. Steve Forbes' volunteers arrived three hours later.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It looked really nice until the Forbes people got here,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
	   By late afternoon, the crowd of competing volunteers and onlookers had
swelled to roughly 400.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   A man wearing a pot on his head was among those trying to make a point
outside the studio.
</P>
<P>
	   Andrew Spannaus, 28, of Leesburg, Va., was holding a sign that read ``Pot
Heads for Gore.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're protesting the fact that Gore has smoked marijuana,'' he said.
``What kind of president would that make?''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore also was the target of two men farther up the long line of signs and
supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Justin Bonner, 20, and Brian McHugh, 19, have been following Gore around
this week wearing maroon and saffron robes and flesh-colored skull caps. They
carried a briefcase labeled, ``Al Gore Finance Committee,'' to criticize Gore's
1996 fund-raising at a Buddhist temple.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the proposals were familiar -- a flat tax, universal health care,
getting rid of pork-barrel legislation, a ban on late-term abortions. But the
names at this debate didn't ring many bells.
</P>
<P>
	   The New Hampshire Historical Society held a forum in Concord on Wednesday
for candidates on the ballot who weren't invited to the nationally televised
debates that night. Eight presidential hopefuls who had shelled out $1,000 to
get on the ballot used their brief time in the spotlight to voice their
concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   Heather Harder of Crown Point, Ind., said she first ran for president 10
years ago because she was disgusted by what she saw in politics. She wants laws
to be written simply so people can understand them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No more hidey holes,'' she said. ``No more smoke and mirrors.''
</P>
<P>
	   A 39-year-old housepainter from Baltimore who has changed his legal name to
Vermin Supreme showed up, but wasn't allowed on the stage because he isn't on
the ballot. Supreme wore a large black rubber boot on his head and flippers as
epaulets.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he's running on a platform of ``mandatory tooth-brushing,'' but his
brochure describes him as ``the friendly fascist, a tyrant you can trust.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Up in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks posted moderate gains in early trading
Thursday as the market took its lead from Wall Street. The dollar was lower
against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average added 18.74 points, or 0.09
percent, to 19,129.93 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Wednesday, the
average closed up 215.66 points, or 1.14 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was quoted at 105.64 yen, 0.54 yen lower than its level of 106.06
yen late Tuesday in Tokyo and down from 105.73 late in New York trading.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, investors were reassured by a marginal advance in the
Dow Jones industrial average, which edged up 3.10 points to 11,032.99 on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Keeping the Nikkei's rise in check, however, weaker technology issues as a
sharp drop by their U.S. counterparts raised concerns that high-flying shares in
the sector may be overvalued.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, the Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 2.3 percent to 4,069.92 amid
concern U.S. monetary authorities may raise interest rates to head off
inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all first-section companies was up
11.22 points, or 0.67 percent, at 1,675.31. The TOPIX rose 31.52 points, or 1.93
percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency trading, dealers said the dollar would likely remain in a tight
range against the yen ahead of the release Friday of the U.S. Employment Cost
Index for the fourth quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no apparent impact on foreign exchange markets from congressional
testimony by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan at Senate hearings on
his renomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan pledged to promote greater openness at the traditionally secretive
Federal Reserve in a fourth term as well as pursue the central bank's
traditional goal of keeping inflation pressures from derailing the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 105.47 yen, down from 106.36 in
late Wednesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.6550
percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.6450. Its price fell 0.09 point to 101.25.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Step Around Abortion  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- George W. Bush and John McCain stepped gingerly
around the abortion issue Wednesday night in feisty campaign debate, the Texas
governor saying the GOP ``must be big enough to welcome'' dissenting views, and
the Arizona senator declining to repeat earlier comments suggesting he might
permit his own child to end a pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Bauer offered an unambiguous counterpoint: ``abortion on demand will be
over in my administration,'' he said as the GOP presidential contenders met in
their final debate before New Hampshire's primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, McCain, Bauer, Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes ranged over topics from
education to the price of home heating oil to campaign finance in 90 minutes of
feisty debate. Their clash was the first half of an unusual double-header.
Democrats Al Gore and Bill Bradley were taking their turn later in the evening
in the same location, a television studio in New Hampshire's largest city, no
live audience in attendance.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP field was smaller by one. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, dropped out of
the race earlier in the day and said he was backing Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain and Bush clashed several times, including once when the Arizona
senator raised his signature issue, an overhaul of the campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When I am in the debate with Al Gore, I am going to turn to Al Gore and
I'm going to say, 'you and Bill Clinton debased the institutions of government
in 1996 and you engaged in reprehensible conduct ...
</P>
<P>
	   ``George, when you're in that debate, you are going to stand there and
you'll have nothing to say.''
</P>
<P>
	   Abortion has played an increasingly prominent role in the runup to last
Monday night's Iowa caucuses and next Tuesday's New Hampshire balloting. And it
came up early and often during the final pre-primary debate.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the GOP presidential front-runner, said ``every child born and unborn
should be protected in law and every child should be protected by life.'' Still,
he said, ``we must welcome people from different persuasions into our party.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, pressed on the issue by Alan Keyes, who opposes all abortions, said,
``I am proud of my pro-life record in public life and I will continue to
maintain it. Stern-faced, the Arizonan added, ``I will not draw my children into
this discussion.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes, evidently unimpressed, turned to McCain and said in light of his
comments, ``how can we trust you'' to lead the country toward a ban on
abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who was a Vietnam prisoner of war, returned to the issue on his own
more than 30 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've seen enough killing in my life. I know how precious human life is.
And I don't need a lecture from you,'' he said to Keyes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I didn't lecture you, Senator McCain,'' Keyes said. '' I simply pointed
out your answer showed no understanding of the moral principle involved in
abortion.''

   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- The first executions under Florida's new law
providing for death by injection unless an inmate prefers the electric chair are
scheduled for late February.
</P>

	   Gov. Jeb Bush on Wednesday ordered the executions for Terry Sims and Anthony

against the use of the electric chair, but it backed off that decision after the
state changed its law.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Having It Two Ways in GOP Debate  </HEADLINE>
   By CALVIN WOODWARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain tried to have it both ways on whether it
matters to have leaders with military experience while Gov. George W. Bush and
Steve Forbes clashed over the Texas governor's record to the point of
oversimplification.
</P>
<P>
	   With Republicans debating first in a New Hampshire primary double-header
Wednesday night, some familiar hyperbole crept into the rhetoric, supplemented
by new overreaching. Democrats Al Gore and Bill Bradley also were meeting later
in the night in their final debate before Tuesday's presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, a Vietnam veteran and former prisoner of war, defended an ad that
touts his military background in making the claim that ``There's only one man
running for president who knows the military and understands the world.''
</P>
<P>
	   Under questioning, the Arizona senator said he was not being unfair and did
not believe someone without military experience is unqualified to be president.
``It's not a handicap,'' he protested. ``It's not at all.''
</P>
<P>
	   Then he immediately asserted, ``This is the first administration with a
president of the United States and a secretary of defense and a secretary of
state that have never spent one minute wearing the uniform of the armed
services.'' He said that ``won't happen on my watch.''
</P>
<P>
	   Whether it's a handicap or not, McCain voted to confirm those very cabinet
members in 1997, Defense Secretary William Cohen and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and Forbes tangled over taxes and education in Texas, and the governor
yet again took credit for a 1997 tax cut that the Legislature actually came up
with after rejecting his own.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes made Texas schools sound like a failure under Bush, in the face of
evidence that the record is at least mixed. Among Forbes' complaints: ``Minority
scores have gone down.''
</P>
<P>
	   The National Urban League released a grading report on the presidential
candidates' positions on education this month that gave Bush and McCain the
highest scores among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush actually was praised for raising standardized test scores among
minority school children and criticized for backing school vouchers -- something
Forbes also supports. Bush and McCain scored 7 out of a possible 15, while
Forbes got 2.

<HEADLINE> House Panel Studies Border Security  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN HUGHES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A combination of heightened U.S. border security and
stricter Canadian immigration laws would help keep terrorists from entering the
United States through Canada, experts told a House subcommittee on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Security is so lax now that Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian citizen, chose to
cross at a U.S. checkpoint in Port Angeles, Wash., instead of using an open
frontier, said Gary Stubblefield, an international security consultant.
</P>
<P>
	   A nine-count federal indictment released last week in Seattle accuses Ressam
and another Algerian man, Abdelmajid Dahoumane, of conspiring ``to destroy or
damage structures, conveyances or other real or personal property within the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Clearly, terrorists such as Ressam believe our border security is a
joke,'' Stubblefield told the Judiciary Committee's panel on immigration and
claims.
</P>
<P>
	   Stubblefield said Ressam was carrying a type of explosive that is often used
to detonate a much larger bomb.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In my view, Ressam was planning up to four massive attacks on the scale of
the Oklahoma federal building or World Trade Towers bombings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, who chairs the subcommittee, said Ressam's arrest
``was a loud wake-up call'' about border security.
</P>
<P>
	   He noted there still are only 300 border agents along the 4,000-mile
U.S.-Canadian border, even though Congress has authorized and funded 1,000 new
agents per year since 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Ressam was arrested Dec. 14 after authorities said his rental car contained
bomb-making materials. Five days later, a Canadian woman was arrested as she
tried to cross into the United States at Beecher Falls, Vt. Prosecutors later
linked Lucia Garofalo to Ressam through telephone records.
</P>
<P>
	   Several experts criticized Canada for having overly generous immigration
laws that give terrorists easy access to North America.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fact that Canadians themselves have not been traditional targets of
political violence has meant a failure of popular vigilance, a failure reflected
... on the part of successive Canadian governments,'' said David Harris, former
chief of strategic planning for the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.
</P>
<P>
	   Raymond Chretien, Canada's U.S. ambassador, defended the laws.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When it comes to fighting terrorism, our laws are as strict or more strict
than American laws,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the arrests of Ressam and Garofalo were ``a success story,'' but
acknowledged Canadian officials are looking at ways to make it easier to detain
suspected terrorists before they try to cross the border.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We clearly need to have better security,'' Smith said after the hearing,
adding the United States should know who is entering the country and what they
are bringing with them.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress already has tried to address the problem. It gave the Immigration
and Naturalization Service until March 30, 2001, to develop an automated system
to track all people who cross the U.S. border. Critics say any such system will
result in border backups that affect trade and tourism.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS has done limited testing of a system that uses cards with magnetic
strips, but the agency is nowhere near implementing it nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Christopher Sands, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington, told the subcommittee the United States should take bold
actions, such as spending more for border protection or forming a high-level
commission with Canada to examine security problems in both countries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've tried to discourage panic,'' Sands said, ``but in trying to
discourage panic, we have sent a message that it's business as usual.''

<HEADLINE> 1 Dead in Alaska Avalanche  </HEADLINE>
   By T.A. BADGER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- A powerful, half-mile wide avalanche smashed into
a home Wednesday, killing a woman, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   Greg Wilkinson, an Alaska State Trooper spokesman, said the body of Martha
Quales, 63, was recovered from the crushed home in Cordova, which was moved 30
feet by the avalanche.
</P>
<P>
	   Quales' housemate, Jerry LeMaster, 50, was found alive by searchers probing
the remnants of the snowslide, which occurred shortly before 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   LeMaster was still mostly buried hours later, though a space had been
excavated to allow him room to breathe.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Apparently whatever he was under kept him from being crushed,'' Wilkinson
said. ``He had no complaints of injuries, and was alert, moving his arms and
talking to rescuers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Another person was recovered uninjured from a demolished home. Everyone else
living in the area, 150 miles southeast of Anchorage, had been accounted for.
</P>
<P>
	   A trooper at the scene said more than a dozen buildings were hit by the
half-mile-wide avalanche. Many were pushed off their foundations, and several
were flattened, Wilkinson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses say the avalanche covered the highway with as much as 15 feet of
heavy snow in places.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was like an explosion,'' said Dune Lankard, whose home was in the
avalanche path. ``Windows started crashing all around and snow was coming in.''

<HEADLINE> Independents Could Tip N.H. Scales  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   An AP News Analysis
By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
</P>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- New Hampshire Republicans weren't the largest group
of voters watching Wednesday's presidential debates. Nor were Democrats.
Independents are the big bloc in this state's politics, and sized up both fields
in a rare doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's one-stop shopping,'' said Terry Blair, a single mother from
Manchester. One of 274,000 registered independents, Blair was tuning into the
90-minute Republican debate at 7 p.m. and -- ``after a break for bath time'' --
was catching the Democrats at 9.
</P>
<P>
	   New Hampshire independents outnumber the state's 265,000 Republicans and
194,000 Democrats, and they can vote in either primary Tuesday. That's why
voters like Blair are so important to the seven major-party candidates,
particularly Republican John McCain and Democrat Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In a tight race -- and we've got close races on both sides of the fence
this year -- the independents can make all the difference,'' Republican state
chairman Steve Duprey said.
</P>
<P>
	   State analysts say at least one-third of the independents support
Republicans almost every election. They react to the tax-cutting, small
government GOP message but just like the ``independent'' label.
</P>
<P>
	   Another one-third, or slightly less, of self-described independents
generally support Democratic candidates and issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Only about 25 percent or so of the registered independents are ``true
independents'' and swing between parties -- a fraction of New Hampshire's total
voting population, said Robin Marra, director of polling at Franklin Pierce
College in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's the universe that Bradley and McCain are fighting over,'' he said.
``It's small, but potentially significant.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain and his party seem to be winning the battle thus far. The number of
self-described independents who said they would support Republicans climbed from
36 percent to 52 percent in the past month, Marra said.
</P>
<P>
	   The trend benefits McCain, who leads front-runner George W. Bush among
independents by a 2-to-1 margin. The Arizona senator has portrayed himself as a
straight-talking reformer to draw even or ahead of the Texas governor in most
state polls.
</P>
<P>
	   Courting independents during the debate, McCain accused Bush of having
``nothing to say'' about campaign finance reform and posed a question to the
entire GOP field: ``Don't you think we as candidates ought to say we'll have
nothing to do with that corruption of our system?''
</P>
<P>
	   Independents support Bradley over his party's front-runner, Vice President
Al Gore, by about 10 percentage points. Like McCain, Bradley supports campaign
finance reform. His laid-back style and promises to fashion a new kind of
politics are particularly appealing to independents.
</P>
<P>
	   But the former New Jersey senator has lost his lead to Gore in state polls,
and is fresh off a big loss in Iowa's caucuses. If undecided independents begin
to sense Gore pulling away, they may bolt to the better race and back McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If I'm George Bush, I'm watching the Democratic debate and rooting for
Bill Bradley,'' Duprey said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain and Bradley are not the only candidates appealing to independents.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore criticized Bradley on Wednesday for not supporting the administration's
first welfare overhaul initiative. ``I would call upon him ... to change his
position, get with the program of welfare reform that works,'' said the vice
president, whose aides believe that welfare reform is popular among
independents.
</P>
<P>
	   After staking out staunch conservative ground on abortion in Iowa, Bush
quickly moderated his tone in New Hampshire by talking more about education. He
used the debate to question's McCain commitment to a federal education program
targeted at poor youngsters.
</P>
<P>
	   For Bradley and McCain, this may be the time to focus on party regulars.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At this point, because the number of undecided independents is relatively
small I would tell both (McCain and Bradley) to shore up -- or in Bradley's
case, build up -- their support in the party bases,'' Marra said. ``Independents
got you into the ball game, but you can't win it without party regulars.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley has the biggest problem there; polls show that Gore does much better
among Democrats than his underdog rival. McCain and Bush have been splitting the
GOP vote evenly, though pollsters surveying the state this week say McCain may
be slipping a bit.
</P>
<P>
	   Blair had stopped outside a video store to talk about the debate. She was
holding a pizza box in one hand and using the other to keep her antsy 5-year-old
daughter, Shannon, from splashing in street slush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know who I'm going to vote for yet. There's a little I like about
all of them. I wish I could take what I like about each and roll it into one
very good candidate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Blair said she likes McCain, Bush and Gore. Bradley seems ``aloof and sort
of'' -- she squinched up her face and made up a word -- ``you know, Glelf!''
</P>
<P>
	   ``But, who knows?'' she said. ``I need to see all of them one more time.''

<HEADLINE> New Megan's Law Guidelines Ordered  </HEADLINE>
   By RALPH SIEGEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A federal judge has ordered New Jersey to rework its
sexual offender notification law, known as ``Megan's Law,'' and threatened to
shut down the notification process if prosecutors can't put tighter controls on
who receives the information.
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to a class action lawsuit filed by the state Public Defender's
Office, U.S. District Judge Joseph Irenas said New Jersey had failed to
implement consistent standards of how notifications are conducted.
</P>
<P>
	   He ordered state Attorney General John Farmer to rewrite the law and issued
an order to halt all sex offender notifications, but he agreed to delay its
implementation to give Farmer a chance to appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling was handed down late Monday, but newspapers weren't notified
until Wednesday because state offices were closed due to snow.
</P>
<P>
	   Megan's law, named for a girl raped and killed by a released convict who
lived in her neighborhood, instructs prosecutors to notify people when sex
offenders classified as a moderate or high risk move into their communities. The
law demands carefully written notification plans for each case that map out
which people on which blocks would be informed. The plans must be approved by a
judge.
</P>
<P>
	   The public defenders say too many people outside the law's limits can learn
about an offender's past. In one case, the notification was given to a
newspaper. In another, a school employee handed out the notification to
students.
</P>
<P>
	   All 50 states have some type of sexual offender law modeled after the New
Jersey law, but many have come under fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to reinstate
Pennsylvania's sexual-predator law, which was thrown out by that state's highest
court on the ground that it violated defendants' rights.

<HEADLINE> Baby Suffocates on Pokemon Toy  </HEADLINE>
   By REX W. HUPPKE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A 4-month-old boy suffocated in his crib on a Burger
King Pokemon ball -- a toy that had been recalled nationally after a similar
death last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Zachary Jones was found dead Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's hard to believe that you go get the kids something to eat and you
bring home a lethal toy,'' said Michael Jones, the boy's grandfather.
</P>
<P>
	   The toy -- a hollow red-and-white plastic ball that is about the size of a
tennis ball and opens clamshell-style -- had been left in Zachary's crib by his
step-grandmother, said Deputy Police Chief Lana Schneider of suburban Lawrence.
She came back later to find the boy with half the ball covering his nose and
mouth, Schneider said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A 4-month-old baby cannot move things from their face, and basically it
suffocated,'' Schneider said.
</P>
<P>
	   The balls were given away by Burger King in children's meals, with a Pokemon
toy inside the sphere. The toys and balls contained no warning and the packaging
described them as ``safety tested and recommended for all ages.''
</P>
<P>
	   Burger King recalled millions of them Dec. 27, after a girl in Sonora,
Calif., suffocated in her playpen Dec. 11 with half a ball over her nose and
mouth.
</P>
<P>
	   Schneider said Zachary's family knew nothing of the recall.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We thought we were safe,'' said Sheila Jones, the boy's step-grandmother.
</P>
<P>
	   Burger King spokesman Charles Nicolas said the restaurant chain widely
publicized the recall, posting signs in restaurants, sending notices to
pediatricians and taking out a full-page ad in USA Today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In December we did publicize the safety hazard with the Poke balls,''
Nicolas said. ``We're exploring further options now that we can do to make
parents aware of this safety hazard for children under 3.''
</P>
<P>
	   The federal Consumer Product Safety Commission will issue another nationwide
Thursday about the balls, spokesman Russ Rader said. He said Burger King would
also run radio and newspaper ads to warn consumers.

<HEADLINE> Man Commits Suicide at Casino  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- A police officer gambling in a high-stakes casino room
committed suicide Wednesday after losing at blackjack.
</P>
<P>
	   The man shot himself in the head while participating in a $100-minimum game
in a VIP room at the MotorCity Casino, Detroit police Inspector William Rice
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He lost a hand and then he pulled out a weapon and shot himself,'' Rice
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The man was in his 30s or 40s, Rice said. Police were withholding his
identity until his relatives could be notified, but the Oak Park police
identified him as an officer there.
</P>
<P>
	   MotorCity Casino spokesman Jack Barthwell said the casino does not allow
firearms but has no metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're still trying to compile his betting history and whether or not in
fact he's been here before,'' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
	   The VIP area, with $100 slot machines and blackjack tables with minimum bets
of $100 to $500, was closed after the shooting, but the rest of the casino
remained open and people continued to gamble.
</P>
<P>
	   MotorCity, which opened Dec. 14, was the second gambling facility to begin
operating since Michigan voters approved a 1996 ballot proposal authorizing
three casinos in Detroit.

<HEADLINE> Energy Acts To Ease Oil Price Surge  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department will delay deliveries to its
emergency oil reserve in hopes of easing the recent surge in fuel prices and
will closely monitor heating oil markets, Secretary Bill Richardson said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration has been under pressure to act as oil prices have edged
close to $30 a barrel from a low of less than $12 a barrel a year ago. Also,
heating oil and diesel fuel prices have risen rapidly.
</P>
<P>
	   The department will renegotiate contracts to postpone delivery on 5 million
barrels of oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in Louisiana and Texas, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Given today's market conditions, it simply makes sense,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
	   The action is intended to put more oil into the market and ease prices. But
many economists question whether it would have much impact.
</P>
<P>
	   The move came a day after Richardson ruled out releasing oil already in the
emergency reserve to influence the oil markets, saying the reserve should be
used to deal with supply emergencies and should not be used to manipulate the
markets. No withdrawal from the reserve is planned, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The government is in the process of accepting 28 million barrels of oil as a
``royalty-in-kind'' payment from producers drilling on government land. About 10
million barrels have been delivered, but delivery of the next 5 million barrels
will be postponed, Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The companies have indicated a willingness to discuss putting additional
oil into the SPR (later) if we postpone delivery dates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Energy experts question whether a relatively small release of oil from the
reserve or diversion of deliveries greatly would affect prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Ebel, director of energy and natural security at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, said only a huge
release of oil would have a major effect.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think that's politically doable,'' Ebel said at a recent energy
conference.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Republican presidential campaign debate Wednesday night, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, the GOP front-runner, said he would not dip into the strategic
oil reserve to reduce fuel prices, saying the stockpile is designed to help the
nation weather a national emergency. Instead, he said the president must
``jawbone'' oil producing nations and persuade them to drop prices.
</P>
<P>
	   The reserve holds about 580 million barrels, equivalent to 62 days of oil
imports.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said his department would more closely monitor the heating oil
markets to ``make certain that ... oil product suppliers can move heating oil to
those who need it most.''
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said he planned to meet next month in Boston with state officials
and industry representatives to examine why the rise in heating oil prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Wednesday, the president of the American Trucking Associations urged
President Clinton to withdraw oil from the government reserves to counter
soaring prices in diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
	   Walter McCormick, the ATA's president, said in a letter that diesel fuel,
which is made from the same distillate as heating oil, jumped 47 percent the
past year, including an 11-cent increase last week. Heating oil prices have
nearly doubled in some parts of the Northeast in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Richardson said the president would seek $154 million in the 2001
budget to help poor families make their homes more energy efficient. The
administration since 1997 had sought that amount each year, but Congress has
provided less each time, including $135 million this year.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, the White House announced it was making an additional $45
million available for low-income families to purchase heating oil. The money is
going to Northeast states and Alaska.

<HEADLINE> Federal judge orders new guidelines for Megan's Law, threatens  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A federal judge has ordered New Jersey to rework
its sexual offender notification law to force prosecutors to put tighter
controls on who receives information about released convicts who still pose a
risk to others.
<P>
	   The next step could be a court-ordered halt to notifications, shutting down
Megan's Law for the first time in two years.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Joseph Irenas issued his order late Monday in Camden
based on a class-action lawsuit filed by the state Public Defender's Office on
behalf of all sex offenders they represent.
</P>
<P>
	   Megan's Law provides for public notification when sex offenders who are
classified as posing a moderate or high risk to the community move into a town
or are released from prison.
</P>
<P>
	   In his ruling, Irenas said New Jersey has failed to implement consistent
standards on how notifications are conducted in the 21 counties.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General John Farmer was unavailable for comment Wednesday and Gov.
Christie Whitman's chief counsel, Richard Mroz, said he could not comment
without having seen the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Farmer's spokesman, Roger Shatzkin, said Irenas' ruling was on a narrow
point with which officials can easily conform.
</P>
<P>
	   "Basically it will require us to revisit our guidelines and to provide
greater uniformity," Shatzkin said. "We clearly think we will be able to resolve
it in a way that will meet the court's concerns."
</P>
<P>
	   Sex offender notifications involve printed fliers with photographs and
details of an offender's appearance, criminal record, employment and address.
Judges approve all proposed notification plans, including strict limits on who
is to receive the information.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit from the Public Defender's office cites 45 instances in which
these limitations were violated. These cases include instances in which a
newspaper published the information, and one in which a school principal who
received a sex-offender warning at home brought it to work and photocopied it
for everyone.
</P>
<P>
	   "Plaintiffs argue that in practice the current system has failed to prevent
the widespread dispersal of confidential information to persons without a
particular need for it," Irenas said, adding that he agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   Irenas said a perfect system is not possible, but that Farmer must do a
better job of balancing the right to warn neighbors against the released
convict's right to privacy.
</P>
<P>
	   "A system of distributing this information with zero leakage to unauthorized
persons is, in reality, unattainable," Irenas wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   "However, the mandate for the attorney general is not to devise a perfect
system, but one calculated to achieve the goals of the statute without
unreasonably impinging on the nontrivial privacy interests of the plaintiffs.
The record before (me) shows that the current system fails to meet this
standard."
</P>
<P>
	   Irenas issued an order to halt all sex offender notifications, but he
simultaneously agreed to stay its implementation to give Farmer a chance to
appeal to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
	   It will then be up to a three-judge panel there to decide whether Irenas'
order should be enforced.
</P>
<P>
	   Ed Barocas of the Public Defender's office said the ruling reinforced that
the U.S. Constitution strictly requires fair implementation of sex offender
policies. "While the courts have noted that the general idea of the law will
stand, nevertheless the law must be implemented in a constitutional manner," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   After Megan's Law took effect in 1995, sex offender notifications were
stopped under court order for most of the next three years. A final court order
to freeze notifications vanished in January 1998 after the U.S. Supreme Court
refused to accept an appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, authorities in the 21 counties have registered 6,513 sex
offenders and have issued community notifications for 1,042 of them. Of these,
110 of the offenders were classified as high risk, triggering door-to-door
notification of neighbors and residents likely to encounter the offender. The
rest were more limited notifications to schools, day care centers and other
facilities with custody of children.
</P>
<P>
	   Irenas' ruling came in the case of a juvenile sex offender identified only
as "Paul P.," a lawsuit that has been expanded into a class action because it
concerns the same privacy points all sex offenders are dealing with.
</P>
<P>
	   News reporters were notified about the ruling Wednesday by the Public
Defender's Office because it was handed down after hours Monday and state
offices were closed Tuesday by a snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
	   Megan's Law is named for Megan Kanka, a 7-year-old Hamilton Township girl
who was raped and murdered in July 1994 by a convicted sex offender who lived
across the street from her Mercer County home.

<HEADLINE> Address Features Education Effort  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will propose more than $3 billion in
education spending increases in his State of the Union address, including the
largest expansion ever of the Head Start program, which helps the nation's
neediest children.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president is announcing a major national effort to invest more in
education and demand more accountability,'' said Bruce Reed, the White House
domestic policy adviser.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the steps Clinton was advocating were doubling an afterschool program
designed to help turn around failing schools, doubling funding for a program
focusing on teacher accountability and new funds to hire more teachers and
improve training.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton already has proposed a $31 billion plan to make college more
affordable, the centerpiece of which was a $10,000 tax deduction to help
millions of Americans pay for tuition, books and university fees. That plan also
would increase Pell Grants.
</P>
<P>
	   Education is always a salient political issue, especially in an election
year. Even though Clinton is ineligible for re-election, emphasizing
prescriptions for improving education in the State of the Union gives him a hand
in framing the debate this year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need a national strategy to turn around failing schools or shut them
down,'' Clinton said in an interview Wednesday with Jim Lehrer of PBS. ``We need
to institutionalize reform with more charter schools. And I think we ought to
make preschool available to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``And everybody that needs it ought to have access to afterschool,'' he
said. ``I think if you get those things done, and we continue to train the
teachers, especially in how to use the computers as you hook up all the schools
to the Internet, I think you're going to see really big, continuing improvements
in education.''
</P>
<P>
	   Becky Campoverde, spokeswoman for the House Education and Workforce
Committee chairman, Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., said the chairman would be
reluctant to embrace ``a proliferation of new proposals.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Clinton-Gore administration believes that every problem has to have a
federal solution and he does not agree with that approach,'' Campoverde said.
``Washington has a role to play, but it is not to get involved in every issue at
the state and local level.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said Goodling favored increasing Pell Grants and ensuring that students
who are not well-off had access to higher education, and for education programs
that support the disabled.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was urging Congress to invest $1 billion in afterschool and summer
school programs to give more students in failing schools access to extended
learning hours. The proposal represents a $547 million increase over the amount
approved last year. It would nearly triple the number of participating children
to 2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also was seeking a $1 billion boost for Head Start, which helps
prepare low-income children for school. Head Start funding has increased by 90
percent during the Clinton administration, officials said, and the new request
would bring Clinton closer to his long-term goal of universal access to
preschool.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Congress appropriated $134 million to fund a national initiative
to increase accountability of teachers and administrators for their schools'
performance. Now, the president wants the fund increased to $250 million.
Additionally, he will propose a $50 million system of bonuses to reward schools
that demonstrate the greatest improvements.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also was revamping a plan to help recruit and train new teachers,
asking for $1 billion in grants to help states locate and retain quality
teachers.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also will seek a $450 million increase, to $1.75 billion
annually, in an initiative approved last year that, if fully funded, would help
states and local school districts hire 100,000 new teachers. Clinton's request
would provide funding for 49,000.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Step Around Abortion  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- George W. Bush and John McCain stepped gingerly
around the abortion issue Wednesday night in feisty campaign debate, the Texas
governor saying the GOP ``must be big enough to welcome'' dissenting views, and
the Arizona senator declining to repeat earlier comments suggesting he might
permit his own child to end a pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Bauer offered an unambiguous counterpoint: ``abortion on demand will be
over in my administration,'' he said as the GOP presidential contenders met in
their final debate before New Hampshire's primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, McCain, Bauer, Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes ranged over topics from
education to the price of home heating oil to campaign finance in 90 minutes of
feisty debate. Their clash was the first half of an unusual double-header.
Democrats Al Gore and Bill Bradley were taking their turn later in the evening
in the same location, a television studio in New Hampshire's largest city, no
live audience in attendance.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP field was smaller by one. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, dropped out of
the race earlier in the day and said he was backing Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain and Bush clashed several times, including once when the Arizona
senator raised his signature issue, an overhaul of the campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When I am in the debate with Al Gore, I am going to turn to Al Gore and
I'm going to say, 'you and Bill Clinton debased the institutions of government
in 1996 and you engaged in reprehensible conduct ...
</P>
<P>
	   ``George, when you're in that debate, you are going to stand there and
you'll have nothing to say.''
</P>
<P>
	   Abortion has played an increasingly prominent role in the runup to last
Monday night's Iowa caucuses and next Tuesday's New Hampshire balloting. And it
came up early and often during the final pre-primary debate.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the GOP presidential front-runner, said ``every child born and unborn
should be protected in law and every child should be protected by life.'' Still,
he said, ``we must welcome people from different persuasions into our party.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, pressed on the issue by Alan Keyes, who opposes all abortions, said,
``I am proud of my pro-life record in public life and I will continue to
maintain it. Stern-faced, the Arizonan added, ``I will not draw my children into
this discussion.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes, evidently unimpressed, turned to McCain and said in light of his
comments, ``how can we trust you'' to lead the country toward a ban on
abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who was a Vietnam prisoner of war, returned to the issue on his own
more than 30 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've seen enough killing in my life. I know how precious human life is.
And I don't need a lecture from you,'' he said to Keyes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I didn't lecture you, Senator McCain,'' Keyes said. '' I simply pointed
out your answer showed no understanding of the moral principle involved in
abortion.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who was dogged the abortion questions all day, earlier told
reporters that if his teen-age daughter became pregnant, it would be a ``family
decision,'' that he, his wife and their child would reach.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes raised the issue, and McCain responded that he alone among the men on
the stage had cast ``pro-life'' votes in the Senate over the past 17 years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I will not draw my children into this discussion,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Abortion, which played a substantial role in Monday's Iowa caucuses, with
the strong impact of the Christian right, is less significant as a political
factor in New Hampshire. There are more independents than either registered
Republicans or Democrats here.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the first debate since Monday night's Iowa caucuses ratified Bush's
standing as front-runner, and gave Forbes bragging rights for a strong second
place showing.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes prodded Bush strongly on his record in Texas, citing a litany of what
he said was shortcomings in tax cuts, education and the size of government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So many half stories, so little time,'' Bush snapped, then pivoted to one
of his best issues as judged in the polls -- his electibility. Voters in Texas
looked at his record and re-elected him in 1998, he said, adding that the Lone
Star state is a ``mighty important state'' for any Republican running for
president. Texas has 32 of the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the
White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer fielded a question from McCain about the impact of special interest
money, and turned it into an attack on his rivals. Mentioning U.S. policy toward
China, he said, ``I think some of you guys already are affected by some of these
big money contributions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No one has ever bought me and no one ever will,'' said Forbes, the heir to
a publishing fortune whose candidacy is largely self-funded.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain leads Bush narrowly in most pre-primary polls, but the race appears
far from settled, particularly given Forbes' strong showing in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Given a chance to pose a question to Bush, the senator renewed a
campaign-long debate about tax cuts, declaring the front-runner's plan wouldn't
leave enough money left over for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush defended his approach, and said that under McCain's less generous tax
cut, money would stay in Washington and ``bigger government'' would be the
result. Bush has called for a cut totaling $483 billion over five years, and
McCain's proposed cut is about half that size.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Al Gore would have written your plan, Mr. senator,'' Bush said to his
rival.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said Bush was ``spinning like Bill Clinton,'' not a compliment, given
his earlier harsh criticism of the president.
</P>
<P>
	   The rapid rise of home heating oil prices in New Hampshire came up, and Bush
said he would not dip into the strategic oil reserve to reduce fuel prices.
That's for a national emergency, he said, and instead, the president must
``jawbone'' oil producing nations and persuade them to drop rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The president should ``get on the phone with the OPEC cartel and say, `We
expect you to open up your spigots.'' He suggested that OPEC nations are
controlling the supply of oil to keep the rates up.
</P>
<P>
	   Abortion came up in the opening moments of the debate, when Bush was asked
what two-sentence change he would make in the Constitution if he could write an
amendment.
</P>
<P>
	   He said every child ``born and unborn'' should be protected by law. Bush
said he is a ``pro-life'' individual, but made no attempt to call for the repeal
of the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe it's important for the next president to recognize that good
people can disagree on this issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 90 minutes later, in the dedate's closing moments, Bauer offered a
different view.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My judges will be pro-life and abortion on demand will be over in my
administration,'' he said. He said his own party hadn't been single-minded
enough about the subject, and said, ``we put judges like David Souter on the
Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
	   Souter was an appointee of Bush's father, President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue is a tricky one politically, in part because independents can vote
in either primary in New Hampshire and McCain, in particular, is hoping to gain
a significant amount of his support from them.
</P>
<P>
	   Beyond that, Bush's campaign is based on a theme of ``compassionate
conservatism,'' and he is hoping at the very least to avoid offending moderate
voters who do not agree with the strongly anti-abortion Republican platform.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate opportunity for any of Bush's rivals to press him on
abortion.

<HEADLINE> One Dead in Alaska Avalanche  </HEADLINE>
   By T.A. BADGER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- A powerful, half-mile wide avalanche smashed into
a home Wednesday, killing a woman, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   Greg Wilkinson, an Alaska State Trooper spokesman, said the body of Martha
Quales, 63, was recovered from the crushed home in Cordova, which was moved 30
feet by the avalanche.
</P>
<P>
	   Quales' housemate, Jerry LeMaster, 50, was found alive by searchers probing
the remnants of the snowslide, which occurred shortly before 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   LeMaster was still mostly buried hours later, though a space had been
excavated to allow him room to breathe.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Apparently whatever he was under kept him from being crushed,'' Wilkinson
said. ``He had no complaints of injuries, and was alert, moving his arms and
talking to rescuers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Another person was recovered uninjured from a demolished home. Everyone else
living in the area, 150 miles southeast of Anchorage, had been accounted for.
</P>
<P>
	   A trooper at the scene said more than a dozen buildings were hit by the
half-mile-wide avalanche. Many were pushed off their foundations, and several
were flattened, Wilkinson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses say the avalanche covered the highway with as much as 15 feet of
heavy snow in places.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was like an explosion,'' said Dune Lankard, whose home was in the
avalanche path. ``Windows started crashing all around and snow was coming in.''

<HEADLINE> N.C. Digs Out From Blizzard  </HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT MOONEYHAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Four months after Hurricane Floyd's devastating
floodwaters, North Carolina struggled Wednesday with the aftermath of a ``white
hurricane'' -- a record 2-foot snowfall in a part of the country that doesn't
have much experience with blizzards.
</P>
<P>
	   The snowstorm left thousands of people stuck in cold, dark homes and
paralyzed Raleigh and other communities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm 45 years old and I've never seen it like this. Our fire trucks
couldn't go anywhere. Our ambulances couldn't go anywhere,'' said Rick Harris,
emergency management coordinator in rural Montgomery County, outside Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
	   Floyd drenched eastern North Carolina with 20 inches of rain Sept. 16 and
caused at least 51 deaths in the worst flooding in state history. Monday night's
snowstorm, accompanied by ice and winds, knocked down trees and plunged homes
and businesses into darkness.
</P>
<P>
	   Raleigh Mayor Paul Coble, snowbound Wednesday like many of his constituents,
described the storm in terms people in North Carolina are certain to understand:
``a white hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
	   More than 140,000 homes and business remained without electricity Wednesday
in North and South Carolina. The storm was blamed for one traffic death in North
Carolina and two in South Carolina. Two people were found outside dead of
exposure in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   A Virginia man with Alzheimer's disease was found dead outside Wednesday
from what a medical examiner said appeared to be hypothermia.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Anne Beach, pastor of the Biscoe Presbyterian Church in Montgomery
Couty, said her church shelter was running out of food to feed people whose
homes lost electricity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have plenty of cans of soup, but nothing much to go with it,'' she
said. ``I'm just praying for the loaves and the fishes to multiply.''
</P>
<P>
	   The storm dumped 20.3 inches at Raleigh-Durham International Airport,
breaking Raleigh's previous single-storm record of 17.8 inches from March 2,
1927. It also set a record for snowfall in a month, giving Raleigh a total of
28.2 inches. The previous mark was 20 inches, in January 1893.
</P>
<P>
	   Travel was especially treacherous along Interstate 85 just south of the
Virginia-North Carolina line. The road was virtually shut down for several hours
Tuesday night and Wednesday morning by jackknifed and abandoned
tractor-trailers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Raleigh-Durham airport was closed until Thursday morning. Spokesman Mike
Blanton said 120 people were stranded in the airport's two terminals Tuesday and
Wednesday, but a hotel chain fed them at no charge.
</P>
<P>
	   Blanton said the airport was closed for several hours during Hurricane Floyd
in September and Hurricane Fran in 1996, but never for two days.
</P>
<P>
	   The nor'easter swept up the East Coast from South Carolina, dropping heavy
snow inland. The Northeast got up to 2 feet of snow, which snarled roads and
closed schools and government offices, but most places were almost back to
normal on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Raleigh and Richmond, Va., which got 11 inches, were still largely paralyzed
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My guess is from what they're saying is it's going to be Sunday before you
start to see any real movement,'' the Raleigh mayor said.
</P>
<P>
	   Stewart McGough, a First Union Bank employee from Charlotte, described
downtown Richmond as a ghost town when he arrived Tuesday night after several
hours of treacherous travel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was like a war zone -- a demilitarized zone of sorts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   National Guardsmen in Humvees in North Carolina and Virginia helped state
troopers reach traffic accidents. The vehicles also served as ambulances and
helped take people to shelters.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Raleigh residents emerged from their houses and apartments Wednesday
for the first time since snow began falling Monday night. About 80 people got in
line outside a supermarket, where managers permitted only a few customers inside
at a time because only a few employees had come to work.
</P>
<P>
	   Some customers needed supplies; others were just breaking the monotony of
being inside for more than a day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's fun for the first couple of days, but then it becomes a nuisance,''
said Eric Ricks, who was in line with his fiancee, Denise Edwards.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards said she had spent her enforced confinement working on wedding
plans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've got him cornered to do the invitations,'' she said. ``I'm addressing
them, and he's stuffing them.''
