UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI SYSTEM CONSIDERS SCHOLARSHIP CUTBACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNN FRANEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The University of Missouri system is considering cuts in
scholarships as part of a larger plan to head off potential budget
problems in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say they must increase revenue and cut spending
because the university is squeezed by growing health-care costs,
smaller-than-requested inflationary increases from the General
Assembly, and a commitment to better faculty and staff raises.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of scholarship money had been on the rise at the main
campus in Columbia, contributing to MU's recent choice as the
nation's No. 1 ``Best Buy'' in the latest college rankings from
U.S. News &AMP; World Report.
</P>
<P>
   But now MU has begun trimming scholarships in a crusade to
balance the budget, including lowering the value of minority
scholarships by $1,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Without financial changes including additional unspecified
scholarship cuts, university system officials say, the campuses
could suffer multimillion dollar deficits within a few years.
</P>
<P>
   University system President Manuel Pacheco asked the chancellors
at each of the university's four campuses to determine how they
could spend less money and bring in more.
</P>
<P>
   The chancellors have given Pacheco their ideas, which he will
present Thursday (Sept. 2) to the university's nine-member
governing Board of Curators for approval.
</P>
<P>
   University officials have said that student scholarships
probably will have to be trimmed. Also, professor positions left
vacant by retirements or resignations may have to stay open.
</P>
<P>
   They have also suggested several ways to bring in more money.
The first is increasing enrollment 3 percent in the next five
years. Overall enrollment for the four campuses has increased
almost 2 percent in the last five years, but had fallen 7 percent
in the five years before that.
</P>
<P>
   The second is getting more grants and contracts, as well as
gifts from corporations and alumni. The third is undertaking more
entrepreneurial activities, such as opening research parks or
making money from campus research discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst for budget changes was this year's flat $400 salary
increase for university professors and staff members.
</P>
<P>
   For many professors, that increase was less than 1 percent.
Professors and department heads on the campuses complained that
such meager increases would hamper efforts to attract the best
professors and would cause some professors to leave for better pay
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Pacheco said such poor raises could not be repeated, and he
wants to give 4 percent increases each year for the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Faculty members say Richard Wallace, chancellor of the
University of Missouri-Columbia campus, told them the campus
probably would cut more than $2 million from the roughly $26
million in financial aid it hands out to undergraduate students.
</P>
<P>
   MU's ratio of money given back in financial aid to money brought
in through tuition is higher than at many other public
universities.
</P>
<P>
   That ratio, called a ``discount rate'' is about 32 percent at
MU, compared with an average of about 20 percent for public
universities.
</P>
<P>
   UMKC's discount rate is about 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Students are upset about the potential cutback, saying that they
once again are being asked to bear the brunt of fixing budget
problems at the university.
</P>
<P>
   When the curators wanted to improve the university in the early
1990s, they chose to pay for it partly by raising tuition 68
percent from 1992 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Sugg, legislative director for the Associated Students
of the University of Missouri, said students want officials to
seriously consider alternatives other than cutting back on
scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the faculty raises were ridiculous. But we hope they
consider all possible resources, instead of taking it from the
financial-aid budget.''
</P>
<P>
   UMKC administrators would not disclose all the details of the
UMKC plan, but interim Provost Marjorie Smelstor said they include
increasing enrollment in certain programs, especially high-tuition
areas such as medicine and dentistry, leaving faculty positions
unfilled, and possibly trimming the amount of money given in
scholarships.

LAKERS' DEAL BRINGS A.C. BACK TO L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 GREEN'S STATS FROM LAST SEASON-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ The Lakers finally dipped into the free-agent pool
Wednesday and added a big man, but the return of A.C. Green _ six
years removed from his glory years here, his numbers in decline _
is unlikely to fill their vacuum at power forward.
</P>
<P>
   Green, who won championships with the Lakers in 1987 and '88,
was obtained in a sign-and-trade deal with the Dallas Mavericks,
who acquired reserve center Sean Rooks. Green, who played the last
two-plus seasons in Dallas, signed a three-year contract before the
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Lakers' decision to trade for Green, who turns 36
next month, rather than sign him as a free agent, indicates they
are still looking for help _ the one-for-one trade leaves the
roster at 11 players.
</P>
<P>
   The trade also reflected the Lakers' frustration with Rooks, who
signed a seven-year, $13.2 million contract with them three years
ago but never became a consistent backup to Shaquille O'Neal. The
Lakers unloaded the remaining four years and $9.12 million on his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   The trade sends Rooks, a seven-year veteran, back to the team
that drafted him in 1992. And it brings Green back to his original
team, just in time to make another run at a championship or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with the final result,'' said Green, who also
considered the Sacramento Kings and Miami Heat. ``There's just so
much history here. I have a long-term relationship here more than
with any other organization. It's just really something to be able
to come back and hopefully complete where you started a career.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an answer to many close friends' prayers, to be sure.
I'm close to home (near Culver City) and to my home church and the
community here in L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the devout Green is the answer to Laker fans' prayers,
the ones asking for a starting power forward, remains to be seen.
Green joins Robert Horry and Travis Knight in the mix, with no
clear starter among them.
</P>
<P>
   Though Green has averaged 10.4 points and 7.8 rebounds in his
14-year career, those figures dipped to 4.9 points and 4.6 rebounds
during the lockout-shortened 1999 season, and he was replaced in
the starting lineup by Gary Trent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm more than capable of playing whatever the position
might be or the minutes that might be required,'' said Green.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers also announced they have signed special consultant
Walt Hazzard to a two-year contract extension.

HOLYFIELD AT LOSS FOR RIGHT WORDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ (begin ital)I lost(end ital).
</P>
<P>
   Such a tiny phrase. Two little words. Five letters and a space.
If you wrote newspaper headlines in the era of pencil and paper,
you remember it's smaller than that, really just four letters,
because I, l, t and a space count a half-width.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the tabloid headline Evander Holyfield could write if
he said it.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)HOLY: I LOST(end ital).
</P>
<P>
   Think of the reaction.
</P>
<P>
   He'd be a rarity, a professional athlete willing to admit the
officials erred in his favor. He'd be hailed as unique, the last
honest man in big-time boxing.
</P>
<P>
   He'd be a bigger hero than he is already as a three-time
heavyweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   But Holyfield cannot bring himself to say it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't lose the fight,'' he said of the 12-round ``draw''
with Lennox Lewis last March in New York in which just about
everybody but Holyfield and two of the three judges saw Lewis
winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually think it was a draw,'' he said. ``I didn't take
anything away from him and he didn't take anything away from me.''
</P>
<P>
   And so on, as if he really believed what the rest of the world
does not.
</P>
<P>
   The two men were in Los Angeles on Wednesday, a day after
announcing they'll fight again Nov. 13 at the Thomas &AMP; Mack Center
in Las Vegas, with Holyfield's IBF and WBA titles and Lewis' WBC
belt at stake and sharper judges at ringside.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, who does not need the $15 million, said he's going
back into the ring for one reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a chance to redeem myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds like a hint that in his heart, he feels Lewis
defeated him last time.
</P>
<P>
   So does his acknowledgement that he misjudged Lewis as a
one-dimensional puncher, his description of March 13 as ``one bad
day out of 365,'' and his excuse that he experienced stomach cramps
off and on throughout the day of the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear, in a roundabout way, he's admitting he lost the fight
by saying he made mistakes,'' Lewis said in his turn at the
microphone.
</P>
<P>
   But coming right out and saying it is something Holyfield
apparently is unwilling to do.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's pride.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it's Don King.
</P>
<P>
   If Holyfield acknowledges that the judges were wrong, that might
be interpreted as saying the judges were corrupt, and re-arm those
who think _ to put it bluntly _ King fixed the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad thing is the mere fact they would (begin ital)say(end
ital) that,'' King said with hurt in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   King, too, will not acknowledge the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who am I to second-guess the judges?'' said the man who's been
known to second-guess referees. ``I cannot say Holyfield lost the
fight. I can say this: It was a very, very unpopular decision. But
it was not a corrupt decision.... That (bribing judges) is not my
forte.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the unpopularity of the decision, Holyfield could score
points on the public scorecard by renouncing it, by saying his
record should read 36-4 instead of 35-3-1.
</P>
<P>
   The fact he won't do the popular thing, his camp argues, is a
sign of his integrity.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Jim Thomas, a Holyfield adviser, if it had been
difficult for the fighter to decide what to say about the
gift-wrapped draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been _ if Evander cared about saying the right
thing,'' Thomas said with a righteous smile.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, like Holyfield and King, thinks it was a draw.
</P>
<P>
   So why do so many people think Lewis pounded him?
</P>
<P>
   ``They were misled by the so-called experts,'' Thomas said,
contending the HBO commentators were biased toward Lewis, who has a
contract with HBO. ``It became a bandwagon because (writers) want
to bash boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans, he argued, are ``not sophisticated enough to judge what
they see for themselves. It's like if you're watching figure
skating, and Dick Button says, `That was a great triple toe-loop!'
You're going to say, `That must have been a great triple toe-loop.'
What do (begin ital)you(end ital) know?''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, we know what the computer statistics tell us _
that Lewis connected with 348 punches (and 65 percent of his power
punches), while Holyfield connected with 130 (and 36 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield offers a lame reply to those stats, suggesting the
fact the Englishman landed that many blows without knocking him
down is a sign of weakness rather than dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like tortured logic to an unsophisticate like me.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the kind of logic it takes to defend Eugenia Williams
and her fellow judges.
</P>
<P>
   You have to laugh at the informal title King has attached to the
Nov. 13 promotion: ``The Search for the Truth.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Holyfield might be the only ones who haven't found it. &QL;

EDITORIAL: AN UNBIASED INQUIRY ON WACO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS grafs 1 &AMP; 2 with updates on Reno)  (dal) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Sept. 2:
</P>
<P>
   Louis J. Freeh, the FBI director, has urged his boss, Attorney
General Janet Reno, to appoint a qualified group of outsiders to
investigate the agency's failure to keep Ms. Reno and Congress
fully informed about all aspects of its role in the 1993 siege of
the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas This is the right thing
to do, since it would be an appalling conflict of interest to have
the FBI and the Justice Department investigating themselves. Ms.
Reno, who is said to have decided Wednesday to mount an independent
inquiry, should seek out and appoint qualified independent
investigators as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The focus would be to find out why the FBI failed for six years
to tell anyone, including Congress and the attorney general
herself, that it had used incendiary tear-gas canisters near the
end of the siege. The revelation last week that such devices were
used has damaged the agency's credibility and greatly embarrassed
Ms. Reno, who for six years had proclaimed that they were not used.
Her seizure Wednesday of a previously undisclosed tape of FBI
agents talking at the scene of the siege is a measure of her fury.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 members of the Branch Davidian sect died in the fire
that consumed the compound on April 19, 1993. There is no evidence
so far to suggest that the incendiary canisters had anything to do
with the fire, which the government says was set by the cultists
themselves. The canisters were apparently lobbed at a concrete
bunker 40 yards from the compound about six hours before the fire
broke out. But the mere fact that the FBI has concealed an
important piece of evidence for six years can only reinforce the
suspicions of those who have never believed the government's
version of events.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives, which also feels badly misled by
the FBI, is talking about two investigations, one by the government
Operations Committee and another by a joint House-Senate commission
that would look into all aspects of the government's handling of
Waco. Such moves seem premature and might interfere with the
independent inquiry proposed by Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   A more sensible course would be for the Justice Department to
appoint outside investigators and, perhaps in consultation with
Congress, determine what ground to cover. Congress, in its
oversight role, could monitor the process and the final report of
that inquiry. At any hint of a cover-up, or if it becomes obvious
that there are important unanswered questions about Waco, Congress
could then hold its own hearings. But for now, a single
investigation, free of partisan bickering, is the way to go.

ARIZ. BIKER, 2 OTHERS DIE IN BAJA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - After years as a biker, Lloyd Hall discovered an
answer to tough situations: Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   From his home base in Topock, along the Colorado River, Hall
traveled the Southwest highways with his wife, Celina, spreading
the Lord's message to outlaws from the Hells Angels, Dirty Dozen
and other gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``Deacon,'' Hall joined the national Christian
Motorcycle Association and organized a local group known as
Born-Again Riders.
</P>
<P>
   But, on Sunday, at a new home in Baja California, the
62-year-old Arizonan ran into someone who couldn't be swayed with
Bibles or bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican and U.S. authorities said Hall was stabbed and
bludgeoned to death by home intruders.
</P>
<P>
   The grisly episode in a community known as Punto Bandera was one
of two murder-robberies on Baja's Gold Coast, a retirement mecca
for U.S. citizens between Tijuana and Ensenada.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, officials said, Timothy Kusler, 60, and his
wife, Joanna, were beaten to death in their home at Playa de
Rosarito, a few miles down the beach. Little information was
available about the Kuslers, who also were listed as Arizona
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Lorena Blanco, a press officer with the U.S. Consulate's Office
in Tijuana, said the couple's home was ransacked. The Associated
Press, quoting Baja California state police, said the Kuslers were
attacked with an iron bar and a bricklayer's trowel. No suspects
have been arrested in that case.
</P>
<P>
   The Halls were victimized three nights later. They were living
in a trailer along the coast while their new home was under
construction. Mexican authorities said Lloyd Hall had stepped
outside to investigate a suspicious noise when at least two men
attacked _ again with a metal bar and other sharp objects.
</P>
<P>
   Hall managed to fire two shots, wounding an assailant in the leg
and torso. His wife got away after being slashed on the leg by the
intruders. Police later arrested gunshot victim Jose Luis Leon
Ramirez, who reportedly gave a confession.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Topock, across the California border from Needles,
expressed sorrow over the Halls' misfortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody just loved 'em,'' said Nicki Mellette, who served
them regularly at a Topock diner. ``They were the type of people,
even when they were eating in a restaurant, they said their
grace.''
</P>
<P>
   Mellette said there is talk of a motorcycle parade through town
in honor of the fallen biker.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Liston, Arizona coordinator for the Christian Motorcycle
Association, said he frequently came across the Halls on
proselytizing missions around the state.
</P>
<P>
   He said Lloyd Hall had owned a motorcycle business in Needles,
which he also used as an impromptu church.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a lot of ministry out of that shop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Liston said bringing the gospel to bikers is occasionally
dangerous, but road preachers have a maxim: ``When we're out there
doing God's ministry, he'll take care of us.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Hall had a special way of dealing with combative
road rogues: ``He taught us something that usually works with the
bikers. He'd say, `Are you the leader of this group?' If they said,
`No,' he'd say, `Well, I'm the leader of my group, and I only talk
to leaders. Hit the road.' They respected that.''
</P>
<P>
   No information was available on funeral services for any of the
homicide victims, or on Celina Hall's medical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mexican and American officials emphasized that the
attacks were not part of a crime wave against tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Angel Isidro, Mexico's deputy counsel general in Phoenix,
described the homicides as random criminal events. He said U.S.
citizens who take normal travel precautions need not worry while
visiting Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, the media has a responsibility not to scare the
public,'' Isidro added. &QL;

GAY PTA GROUP IN SEATTLE MAY BE FIRST OF ITS KIND IN NATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REBEKAH DENN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Heather's two mommies now have a PTA _ as does anyone
else who cares about gay and lesbian students or their families.
</P>
<P>
   Succeeding where another state failed, a Seattle-area group has
organized what is apparently the nation's first gay and lesbian
Parent Teacher Association.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers say the group is meant to address the ``unique
challenges and difficulties'' often faced in schools by students,
educators and families who are gay, lesbian, bisexual and
transgendered.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington State PTA is expected to formally grant a charter
to the group as soon as its final paperwork is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Some 50 people have signed on so far to join the group, called
the Gay Lesbian Parent Teacher Student Association of Greater Puget
Sound. Like many PTAs, the group added ``Student'' to its name and
is known as a PTSA.
</P>
<P>
   Goals include fighting the problems that studies show homosexual
students are more likely to face: harassment, abuse, higher dropout
rates and increased suicide risks.
</P>
<P>
   Members say the group is open to everyone: parents of gay or
lesbian students, straight students with gay or lesbian parents, or
anyone else who supports their mission, regardless of sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to form a similar group last year in Dade County, Fla.,
were rebuffed by the Florida State PTA, where leaders saw the
proposed group as a special interest organization that would either
duplicate or detract from the work of traditional school-based
PTAs.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle activist Linda Jordan, representing a group called
Parents and Teachers for Responsible Schools, raised similar
concerns Wednesday. She called the local gay PTSA an ``exclusive''
group set up by homosexual activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another way to carry out an agenda, and I think it's
totally inappropriate,'' she said, asking whether educators or
students who consider homosexuality wrong will be labeled bigots.
</P>
<P>
   But Gay Lesbian PTSA President Susan Carmel, a straight parent
who said her now-grown gay son was miserably harassed in middle
school, countered that the group is far from exclusionary.
</P>
<P>
   She said the group has many straight members and a mission that
will benefit all schools and families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The learning stops when kids feel threatened like this,'' she
said. ``They do not feel safe in schools, and there is no reason
for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, some Gay Lesbian PTSA projects might have nothing
to do with gays or lesbians, Carmel said. One early idea is for the
group to help a school without its own PTA with needed projects,
such as cleaning the playground.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Bond, a regional PTA director whose territory includes
Seattle, thought that would be a good way to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take away the demonization of homosexuality, that somehow
these people are different and strange,'' she said. ``They're
people who care just like everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond expects the group to complement rather than drain local
school-based PTAs.
</P>
<P>
   Parents have said in surveys that they weren't comfortable
bringing up issues surrounding gay or lesbian students at their
regular PTA meetings, and felt uneasy bringing gay or lesbian
partners to school, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to have a place where people could be open and
comfortable,'' Bond said in welcoming the new group.
</P>
<P>
   The gay PTSA is starting off as a regional group, not attached
to any one school or district, although it may split into chapters
as it grows.
</P>
<P>
   State PTAs, rather than the national organization, have sole
authority over approving or declining new Parent Teacher
Associations and Parent Teacher Student Associations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't anything that limits what you can form a PTA
around,'' said Jim Carpenter, executive director of the Washington
State PTA. The PTA mission is broad, encompassing children's
health, safety, and education in and out of school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nontraditional'' PTAs, such as senior citizens PTAs, already
exist and are probably the wave of the future, Carpenter said. The
state group has fielded questions about PTAs based on ethnic and
cultural groups, and such groups will likely follow the Gay Lesbian
PTSA's lead, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The National PTA has offered no public direction on which
state's approach _ Florida's or Washington's _ was in line with the
national organization's goals. The Florida state PTA, however, said
it researched the issue with National PTA attorneys before
rejecting the Florida group.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the National PTA wasn't familiar with the
issue, but said PTAs wouldn't normally represent a specific segment
of the community. The National PTA director did not return phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Even with support from the Washington State PTA, the gay Puget
Sound group is braced for controversy as the school year starts.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Public Schools faced an outcry in 1997 after accepting a
grant to distribute books to elementary schools about gay and
lesbian families, such as ``Heather Has Two Mommies.'' The ruckus
led to the formation of Parents and Teachers for Responsible
Schools, the group Jordan leads.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado in 1994, one PTA chapter announced plans to disband
after the state PTA recommended a resolution that schools teach
tolerance of gays and lesbians. The measure was defeated, and the
disbanding branch said such issues were beyond the PTA's scope.
</P>
<P>
   But they're vitally important to new Gay Lesbian PTSA members
like Greg Stair, an art teacher in the Everett School District.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the group partly because of the bullying and insults
he sees directed toward gay and lesbian students _ or students who
are rightly or wrongly perceived as gay.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, he said, people think it is acceptable to use
demeaning slurs or ``to pick on anybody they see as having a
questionable sexual orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that can help out in getting the word out that that's
not OK, that there are resources available (for students), to me is
a bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   Carmel said she hopes membership will grow as word spreads about
the new group.
</P>
<P>
   One likely candidate is parent Gabi Clayton, who applauded the
gay PTSA's formation from her Olympia home and said she hopes to
join.
</P>
<P>
   Her 17-year-old son, Bill, who was bisexual, committed suicide
in 1995 afer he was beaten in what was regarded as a hate crime on
a high school campus during spring break.
</P>
<P>
   All the teenager could see ahead, Clayton said, was ``a lifetime
of facing a world filled with hate and violence.''
</P>
<P>
   She's worked to eliminate such hatred in the years since his
death.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she said, ``I know and hear every day the horror stories.
Honestly, we still have a long way to go.''

VALDES' BAD LUCK CONTINUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Dodgers lost 5-4 to Milwaukee in the finale of
a three-game series Wednesday at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Dodgers lost a close one. Right-hander Ismael
Valdes pitched, so that has to happen. Valdes is 9-12, and nine of
those losses have come by one run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a frustrating year,'' Valdes said in echoing
statements that seem to accompany nearly every one of his starts.
``Maybe next year I'll have better luck. My luck could change next
season.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a number of things that hurts Valdes, from fielding errors
to lack of hitting in the clutch to ill-timed pitches.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers scored three unearned runs in the first inning when
shortstop Mark Grudzielanek booted what should have been the third
out. The offense ``helped'' in the misery by going 1 for 15 with
runners in scoring position. Grudzielanek's three-run triple in the
seventh was the only hit while Gary Sheffield failed to score a
runner from third with less than two outs on three occasions.
</P>
<P>
   And there was also Valdes, who hung tough for six innings but
gave up two runs on a two-out single in the seventh when the
Brewers went ahead 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``The killer was the last two,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
said. ``(Valdes) got behind (Mark Loretta), and not wanting to walk
him... he's a pretty good fastball hitter and hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Charting 20: The Dodgers have their rotation set up for Kevin
Brown to get seven more starts in his quest for 20 wins. To
accomplish that, Brown, who is 15-6, would be slated to pitch the
last game of the season in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is on a six-game winning streak and hasn't lost since July
5, a span of 11 starts. In that time, Brown has a 2.56 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's next start will be Saturday against the Chicago Cubs at
Wrigley Field. He flip-flopped with Darren Dreifort, who will start
Sunday. Brown is also scheduled to pitch against Montreal and close
out his home season against San Diego. Those three teams are a
combined 54 games under .500.
</P>
<P>
   The other four starts are against the Mets, San Francisco
(twice) and Houston, which are a combined 61 games over .500. But
the task isn't as arduous considering Brown's success against the
Giants. He's 1-0 with a 2.46 ERA against them this season, and 7-0
with a 0.78 ERA in his career.
</P>
<P>
   For all his success, Brown hasn't won 20 games often. The only
time he's accomplished the feat was when he went 21-11 for Texas in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Cromer activated: After spending nearly two months on the
disabled list with an irregular heartbeat, utility infielder Tripp
Cromer was activated. He was the only one activated with rosters
expanding from 25.
</P>
<P>
   Cromer, who's hitting .208 in 29 games, played all four infield
positions during a rehab assignment with Single-A San Bernardino.
He went 9 for 18 with a homer and eight RBI.
</P>
<P>
   But what Cromer does in the last month could determine where he
winds up next season, either with the Dodgers or another
organization. A middle infielder by trade, there is interest in the
31-year-old because of his versatility.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a team like this, it helps you to be able to do
everything,'' Cromer said. ``I know there's been some interest
(from other teams), but I'd like to stay here and win here.''
</P>
<P>
   FYI: Right-handers Robinson Checo (groin) and Antonio Osuna
(elbow) were scheduled to make rehab appearances for San Bernardino
on Tuesday.... The Dodgers are 19-23 in one-run games.... The
23,616 in attendance was the smallest crowd at Dodger Stadium this
season.... Grudzielanek extended his hitting streak to nine games.

MACHINISTS APPROVE CONTRACT OFFER FROM BOEING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Boeing Machinists endorsed a three-year contract offer
Wednesday, a move that buys the company three years of labor peace
and provides a competitive wage increase to 44,000 Machinists.
</P>
<P>
   The contract covers the largest union at the Seattle-based
aerospace giant and serves as a model for other union contracts
within the company. It also stands to inject more than $100 million
into the local economy from bonuses paid to workers for endorsing
the pact.
</P>
<P>
   Workers weighed a package that offers a 4 percent raise in each
of the first two years, a 3 percent increase in the third year and
a 10 percent lump-sum bonus this year. Equally important to many
Machinists is what the company didn't push: a seven-day workweek
and new health care premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Many workers welcomed the package, saying it was a fair offer
that they were unlikely to improve by striking.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, workers felt they were able to secure concessions
from Boeing because the company is attempting to rebound from two
years of production and financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think the company had to put its best foot forward,''
said Maureen Allen, who has worked at Boeing for 22 years, after
she cast her vote at the Renton union hall. ``The company was fair
on all the important issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing needed ratification of the contract to eliminate its
greatest labor threat because competition with rival Airbus
Industrie for new customers is intensifying. It also couldn't
afford a disruption in production in a year it's scheduled to
deliver a record 620 airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives decided ``a good relationship with its work
force was critical in a very competitive industry,'' said Harley
Shaiken, a professor of labor relations at the University of
California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing will pay a price for peace with its most powerful labor
union, the International Association of Machinists. For example,
the company will pay nearly $200 million in bonuses to the
Machinists this year under the contract proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew the company couldn't afford a strike,'' said Bill
Johnson, the president of the union's District Lodge 751 and a key
negotiator. ``We capitalized on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing Chairman Phil Condit had a different take on the
contract. He held it up as another step in the company's effort to
boost productivity and become more competitive in the aerospace
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``With ratification, we can move forward and bring the full
measure of our skills and productivity to the workplace,'' Condit
wrote in an open letter to employees. ``It's more than fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The broad support for the offer stands in stark contrast to the
last round of negotiations in 1995, when Machinists struck for 69
days after rejecting a contract offer and their union leaders'
endorsement of the language. In fact, union members struck during
two of the past three contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was pleased with the offer this time either. Some
workers charged that negotiators failed to protect their jobs from
being sent outside to independent contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want any more money. I just want a job,'' said Beverly
Wickham, an 18-year Boeing employee, after she cast her ballot
against the contract in Renton.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials argued they secured additional job security for
their members. They pointed to a provision that stated Boeing won't
lay off employees because of either subcontracting. In addition,
the contract would allow a joint union-company committee 180 days
to review subcontracting initiatives and to suggest alternative
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, however, retained the right to hire outside contractors
and to lay off workers in other circumstances, such as a downturn
in airplane orders.
</P>
<P>
   Other workers were upset the company only offered to boost
monthly pension benefits by 25 percent. They added that the
contract didn't offer a cost-of-living adjustment for Boeing
retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the criticism, union leaders were optimistic since
ending negotiations early Saturday morning that their members would
ratify the proposal when they voted in union halls in Puget Sound,
Spokane, Portland, Ore., and Wichita, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Under union rules, a contract must win support of a simple
majority of those voting. However, if less than two-thirds of those
voting support the second question on the ballot _ whether to
endorse a strike _ the contract also goes into effect.
</P>
<P>
   The latest information on the contract vote is posted on the
Seattle Post-Intelligencer's Web site (www.SeattleP-I.com) as well
as the union's site, (www.IAM751.org). Information from the company
can be found at its Web site (www.Boeing.com).
</P>
<P>
   The current contract expired Thursday at 12:01 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, some Machinists said they didn't think they could
gain much more by putting their tools down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably as good as we are going to get,'' said Wayne
Ward, who has worked at Boeing for the past three years.

BEANIE BABY BYE-BYE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN CRENO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phoenix - The Beanie Baby world is buzzing with rumors.
</P>
<P>
   The company that makes the fuzzy little plush toys said it's
``retiring'' its current crop of Beanies at the end of the year,
sending collectors into a panic and flooding stores with buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are flocking in to buy up what they can,'' said Mark
Besler, owner of Dolls Bears &AMP; Surprises in Phoenix. ``They want to
make sure they have them. People who procrastinated before are
picking them up now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ty did nothing Wednesday to clarify things. It did not return
calls, and some Beanie-savvy observers thought that made plenty of
sense, calling the uproar a calculated piece of hype that worked
perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Ty Warner knows exactly what he's doing in marketing,''
said Linda Burner, co-owner of Bears &AMP; More in Glendale. ``He's a
genius. Why would you stop making a product that sells for $5 that
everybody wants?''
</P>
<P>
   Burner, a Beanie collector, said the announcement couldn't have
been better timed. She said it came when a new line of the Furby
toy called Furby Babies was hitting the market and overshadowed
that launch.
</P>
<P>
   Ty Inc., the Illinois company that makes Beanies, posted its
``retiring'' Beanies announcement on its Internet site Tuesday,
then removed it. The announcement ran at the end of a list of new
Beanies that included ``The End'' black bear - an apparent
reference not only to the end of the century but the conclusion of
the current line of Beanies.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough to set off bombardment of Beanie rumors, fueled
in part by media speculation that Ty was getting out of the Beanie
Baby business entirely. Web sites for Beanie fans were loaded with
grief-stricken postings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just totally shocked that Ty is quitting with the
Beanies. It's just hard to believe,'' one writer said on Ty's chat
page.
</P>
<P>
   The situation was so out of hand by the end of Tuesday that
company owner Ty Warner tried to clear up things with his own
message on the chat page.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the millennium is coming to an end. I assure you the
beanies will not end,'' the message said.
</P>
<P>
   Beanie collectors weren't calmed. The phone started ringing at
Millie's Hallmark in the Ahwatukee-Foothills at 8:30 a.m.
Wednesday. The store opens at 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``All day long it's been people coming in and calling,''
assistant manager Cheryl Dekker said.
</P>
<P>
   But one large collector said Tuesday that the speculation among
dealers is that Ty simply planned to introduce dozens of new
beanies next year and that the retirement was simply manufactured
to help the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secondary market has collapsed the market in the last six
months,'' said George Papania of Georges Video Games and
Collectables in Las Vegas. ``What we did was retaliate for the fact
that they kept these things out too long without retiring them.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally intended to be a cheap toy for kids, Beanie Babies
retail for about $5. But collectors have taken over a big part of
the market and some hard-to-find Beanies can fetch thousands of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Collectors call stores constantly to find out exactly when the
new, most sought-after ones will hit the shelves, and sometimes
camp out for hours to snare one.
</P>
<P>
   Sari Powazek, owner of The Doll House in Scottsdale, has seen
toys come and go, but nothing to rival the Beanies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never ever seen anything as crazy as this and we have
been in the toy business for 22 years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Healis of Glendale has Beanies piled on her side of the
bed when she's not sleeping in it. She finds them irresistibly
cute.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just adorable,'' she said. ``For the price you can't
beat them. They make a beautiful gift.''
</P>
<P>
   But some are puzzled by the Beanie phenomenon. Jonathan Adolph,
executive editor of ``Family Fun,'' a general-interest family
magazine based in Northampton, Mass., said frenzied bidding for
Beanies and for such hot Christmas toys as Tickle Me Elmo sends a
bad message to kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``For kids, it's one of these classic lessons of supply and
demand,'' he said. ``We see the same lessons every year. It's kind
of a sad commentary on social values when you turn something not
inherently valuable to a hugely inflated price.'' &QL;

GLICKMAN DEFENDS MUCH-ASSAILED NORTHWEST FOREST PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT MCCLURE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It's been called ``a demonstrable failure'' by a U.S.
senator from Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   A key environmentalist this week deemed the Northwest Forest
Plan ``broken.''
</P>
<P>
   And the timber industry insists the plan ``will never work.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, visiting Seattle
Wednesday, said the effort to protect old-growth forests, spotted
owls and other threatened species is fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may remember eight or nine years ago, people were at the
proverbial loggerheads,'' said Glickman, whose agency oversees the
U.S. Forest Service. ``There was almost a revolution between timber
interests and environmental interests. That is no longer the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments were the first by a high-ranking Clinton
administration official since U.S. District Judge William Dwyer, in
a strongly worded ruling last month, halted dozens of federal
timber sales from Washington to Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer said the government approved logging on federal lands
without looking hard enough to see whether sensitive plants and
animals would be harmed.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer ruled that the government's shortcomings were ``unlawful
... far from being minor or technical violations'' and were
``contrary to the plain language'' of the Northwest Forest Plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've read the (judge's) decision. The decision in no way says
the plan is a failure or that our compliance is a failure,''
Glickman said. ``In fact, I think the decision assumes that the
plan is substantially a success.''
</P>
<P>
   Glickman said the Forest Service believes it has done enough to
seek out the sensitive plants and animals, even though Dwyer
disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, the issue is expected to be raised again in
Washington, D.C. A vote is expected on a maneuver by Sen. Slade
Gorton, R-Wash., that would undercut Dwyer's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton inserted a provision into a spending bill that would give
the government full discretion in deciding how hard to look for the
sensitive plants and animals, no matter what federal judges say.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration opposes that measure. Instead, it is
planning to readjust the rules governing the Northwest Forest Plan
early next year, including the requirements to seek out the
sensitive plants and animals.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman said scientists are learning more all the time about
how to seek out the protected plants and animals, which are
primarily secretive creatures such as small rodents and salamanders
and hard-to-find plants such as lichens and mosses.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have said the surveys for the plants and
animals they originally agreed to in the 1993 plan are too
difficult or, in some other cases, too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``At most, the judge's ruling reflects his desire to see us
comply with his interpretation of some of the language in the
plan,'' Glickman said. ``This is not in any way, shape or form a
condemnation of the plan or our efforts to comply with it. I really
am convinced of that.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not the way environmentalists see it, though.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, several dozen environmental groups, including some
of the same ones that sued in Dwyer's court to stop the federal
timber sales, are sending a letter to President Clinton expressing
``deep disappointment'' over administration policy on Pacific
Northwest forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The required wildlife surveys are the bare minimum mitigation
for continued destruction of old-growth,'' says a draft of the
letter to Clinton. ``If the surveys are in fact not feasible,
old-growth logging is no longer ecologically or legally
justified.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the signatories is the Oregon Natural Resources Council,
the lead plaintiff among 13 in the case before Dwyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan is broken,'' said Doug Heiken of the ONRC. ``The plan
is a failure. The plan may never have been viable because it's
based on the logging of old growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., told an audience in rural
Douglas County that the plan is ``a cruel hoax ... a demonstrable
failure.'' Smith supports Gorton's effort to undercut the judge's
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Northwest Forest Plan was hammered out,
environmentalists had virtually stopped logging of old-growth
forests. The plan allows some limited logging of old-growth forests
to continue, on the theory that if the cut is slowed down, some
other, medium-age stands will grow into the kind of forests needed
by spotted owls and hundreds of other kinds of animals and plants.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists challenged the plan immediately after its
adoption in 1993, saying it allowed a third or more of the region's
old-growth forests to be logged. Dwyer rejected that challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The environmentalists' letter to Clinton cites a recent study by
an Oregon economist that found that logging is becoming less and
less important to the economy of the region. It accounts for 3.1
percent of Pacific Northwest employment. And, as Dwyer noted in a
ruling last week, most of those jobs are based on logs coming from
private lands, or those owned by the state government _ not federal
timber sales.
</P>
<P>
   The timber industry has long said the Northwest Forest Plan is
unworkable, said Jim Geisinger, president of the Northwest Forestry
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton administration has placed so many restrictions on
the Forest Service that it's impossible for them to deliver even
the small amount of timber that is called for in the Northwest
Forest Plan,'' Geisinger said.
</P>
<P>
   He said environmentalists, by shutting down timber sales
expected when the plan was hammered out in 1993, ``have moved the
goal post again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question in my mind that the Forest Service did not
do what the plan said it was supposed to do,'' Geisinger said.
``... There's not enough money in Fort Knox or enough experience in
the scientific community'' to conduct the thorough surveys
contemplated in the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Geisinger said several small family-run timber mills in Oregon,
because of Dwyer's rulings, have no lumber supply for 2000 and the
first part of 2001 and will probably have to be closed.
</P>
<P>
   He could provide no estimate for how many jobs, overall, may
eventually be affected. He said it could be a few hundred or even
as many as 1,000.

MACHINISTS APPROVE CONTRACT OFFER FROM BOEING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Boeing Machinists endorsed a three-year contract offer
Wednesday, a move that buys the company three years of labor peace
and provides a competitive wage increase to 44,000 Machinists.
</P>
<P>
   The contract covers the largest union at the Seattle-based
aerospace giant and serves as a model for other union contracts
within the company. It also stands to inject more than $100 million
into the local economy from bonuses paid to workers for endorsing
the pact.
</P>
<P>
   Workers weighed a package that offers a 4 percent raise in each
of the first two years, a 3 percent increase in the third year and
a 10 percent lump-sum bonus this year. Equally important to many
Machinists is what the company didn't push: a seven-day workweek
and new health care premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Many workers welcomed the package, saying it was a fair offer
that they were unlikely to improve by striking.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, workers felt they were able to secure concessions
from Boeing because the company is attempting to rebound from two
years of production and financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think the company had to put its best foot forward,''
said Maureen Allen, who has worked at Boeing for 22 years, after
she cast her vote at the Renton union hall. ``The company was fair
on all the important issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing needed ratification of the contract to eliminate its
greatest labor threat because competition with rival Airbus
Industrie for new customers is intensifying. It also couldn't
afford a disruption in production in a year it's scheduled to
deliver a record 620 airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives decided ``a good relationship with its work
force was critical in a very competitive industry,'' said Harley
Shaiken, a professor of labor relations at the University of
California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing will pay a price for peace with its most powerful labor
union, the International Association of Machinists. For example,
the company will pay nearly $200 million in bonuses to the
Machinists this year under the contract proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew the company couldn't afford a strike,'' said Bill
Johnson, the president of the union's District Lodge 751 and a key
negotiator. ``We capitalized on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing Chairman Phil Condit had a different take on the
contract. He held it up as another step in the company's effort to
boost productivity and become more competitive in the aerospace
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``With ratification, we can move forward and bring the full
measure of our skills and productivity to the workplace,'' Condit
wrote in an open letter to employees. ``It's more than fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The broad support for the offer stands in stark contrast to the
last round of negotiations in 1995, when Machinists struck for 69
days after rejecting a contract offer and their union leaders'
endorsement of the language. In fact, union members struck during
two of the past three contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was pleased with the offer this time either. Some
workers charged that negotiators failed to protect their jobs from
being sent outside to independent contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want any more money. I just want a job,'' said Beverly
Wickham, an 18-year Boeing employee, after she cast her ballot
against the contract in Renton.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials argued they secured additional job security for
their members. They pointed to a provision that stated Boeing won't
lay off employees because of either subcontracting. In addition,
the contract would allow a joint union-company committee 180 days
to review subcontracting initiatives and to suggest alternative
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, however, retained the right to hire outside contractors
and to lay off workers in other circumstances, such as a downturn
in airplane orders.
</P>
<P>
   Other workers were upset the company only offered to boost
monthly pension benefits by 25 percent. They added that the
contract didn't offer a cost-of-living adjustment for Boeing
retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the criticism, union leaders were optimistic since
ending negotiations early Saturday morning that their members would
ratify the proposal when they voted in union halls in Puget Sound,
Spokane, Portland, Ore., and Wichita, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Under union rules, a contract must win support of a simple
majority of those voting. However, if less than two-thirds of those
voting support the second question on the ballot _ whether to
endorse a strike _ the contract also goes into effect.
</P>
<P>
   The latest information on the contract vote is posted on the
Seattle Post-Intelligencer's Web site (www.SeattleP-I.com) as well
as the union's site, (www.IAM751.org). Information from the company
can be found at its Web site (www.Boeing.com).
</P>
<P>
   The current contract expired Thursday at 12:01 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, some Machinists said they didn't think they could
gain much more by putting their tools down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably as good as we are going to get,'' said Wayne
Ward, who has worked at Boeing for the past three years.

U.S. STILL WAGING WAR ON OLD VET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - One day last week, after listening to a prosecutor and
a defense attorney argue about evidence and disclosure for about 20
minutes, U.S. Magistrate Morton Sitver suddenly decided the trial
scheduled to begin that morning would be postponed until October.
</P>
<P>
   Sitver then picked up his gavel and adjourned the court, his
mallet landing squarely between the shoulders of Bob DeHeer.
</P>
<P>
   Or so it seemed.
</P>
<P>
   The old veteran slumped forward in his chair, leaning on the
cane he held with his hands, his head shaking slowly from side to
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``All rise,'' declared the clerk as Judge Sitver strode from the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   DeHeer pushed hard on the walking stick, wearily lifting himself
from a chair at the defense table. He is 77 years old and suffers
from arthritis, bad hearing and other maladies of an aging warrior.
</P>
<P>
   Standing up would be a lot easier for him if he also didn't have
the full weight of the U.S. Department of Justice on his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unbelievable,'' DeHeer said afterward. ``Who would
have guessed that all this would happen over a parking spot?''
</P>
<P>
   In May, DeHeer drove to the Carl T. Hayden Veterans Affairs
Medical Center to have his hearing aids adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   When he got there, DeHeer says he couldn't find an available
handicapped parking space nearby, so he decided to park in one of
several vacant spots marked temporarily with ``VIP'' signs. &QL; 
BUREAUCRATS VS. VETS &QL; 
Federal inspectors were visiting the hospital that day, and VA
administrators apparently believed the convenience of bureaucrats
was more important than the convenience of World War II vets like
DeHeer.
</P>
<P>
   What happened after DeHeer tried to pull into one of the VIP
spaces became the subject of his trial.
</P>
<P>
   One of the federal officers patrolling the parking lot told
DeHeer that he couldn't park in a VIP spot because he wasn't a VIP.
This didn't sit well with DeHeer, and after an angry exchange, the
elderly man was hauled off in handcuffs and locked in a cell.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of hours later, he was released, but not before being
issued two citations, a $50 disorderly conduct charge and a $25
ticket for failing to comply with a federal officer.
</P>
<P>
   DeHeer could have paid the fines and walked away and that would
have been the end of it.
</P>
<P>
   But he chose to fight.
</P>
<P>
   A long time ago, when his country asked him to stand and fight
rather than turn and walk away, DeHeer stood his ground and fought.
</P>
<P>
   Old habits are hard to break.
</P>
<P>
   The one-time machine-gunner with a Bronze Star and a Purple
Heart and bad hearing and arthritis refused to pay the fines and
demanded his day in court.
</P>
<P>
   The government could have backed off. &QL; 
CASE NOT DISMISSED &QL; 
Even better, the government could have recognized that Bob DeHeer
and every veteran like him has earned the title VIP, qualifying him
to park in a space reserved for such individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The case could have _ and should have _ been dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the U.S. Attorney's Office decided to drag DeHeer into
court.
</P>
<P>
   I've asked Justice officials why they're doing it, but I've
never gotten an answer. Maybe it's only because they can.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, DeHeer found himself in the federal courthouse in
Phoenix watching attorneys argue complicated legal issues until his
case was postponed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been very hard on Bob,'' said his attorney, Michael
Rooney. ``I believe it's tragic for a fellow of his age and
background to have to go through this.''
</P>
<P>
   Tragic, and confusing.
</P>
<P>
   You can see it on Bob DeHeer's face. Not the anger he felt that
day in the parking lot. Not the outrage he felt over having been
fined. Just _ bewilderment.
</P>
<P>
   And who could blame him?
</P>
<P>
   A man like DeHeer, a soldier, a patriot, an old-fashion
idealist, never dreamed he'd one day do battle against the country
for which he'd help win a war. &QL;

CLEMENS STILL LEADS YANKEES IN QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Yankees' players and manager, Joe Torre, talked as if the
Roger Clemens issue was largely a creation of the public's
imagination before Wednesday night's game against the Oakland
Athletics. They said that Clemens had been pitching well lately and
that the perhaps unrealistic expectations that have been heaped
upon his burly shoulders were responsible for the perception that
he is struggling mightily in the historic pinstripes.
</P>
<P>
   They seemed to be hoping that the Clemens they disbanded a
proven rotation for had finally arrived, that his splendid
performance in Friday's victory over the Seattle Mariners was
evidence that he was back to being the intimidating hurler who had
won five Cy Young Awards.
</P>
<P>
   But apparently that Clemens is not back, even if the Yankees,
who stuck to their story after Clemens was tagged by the A's, are
unwilling to admit it.
</P>
<P>
   For what seems like the umpteenth time this season, Clemens
followed an outstanding outing with a poor one. He was not horrible
Wednesday night, just mediocre enough to walk four batters, hit
another, and be ripped for 5 runs on 6 hits in 7 innings in the A's
embarrassingly thorough 7-1 victory over the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third time in four meetings this season that Omar
Olivares (13-9, 3.84 era) has beaten the Yankees and enabled the
A's to stay within two games of Boston in the American League
wild-card race, a race that if the A's win could land them opposite
the Yankees in the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Of greater concern to the Yankees, however, was the work of
Clemens, who for the eighth time faltered badly in the immediate
aftermath of a sparkling performance. In the eight starts after a
game in which he has allowed zero or no earned runs, Clemens has
surrendered 33 earned runs in 43 1/3 innings. He is 1-2 in those
games with a 6.85 ERA. Following the four games in which he allowed
no runs, Clemens has a 7.94 ERA (20 runs in 22 2/3 innings) and an
0-2 record.
</P>
<P>
   While it would seem that Clemens' almost predictable ebbs and
flows would dash the beliefs within the organization that his
troubles are over, that is not the case. Torre and the catcher, Joe
Girardi, raved about Clemens' pitching afterwards, and even the
notoriously dissatisfied Clemens said he had good stuff. ``I don't
think the score tells you about his stuff,'' Torre said. ``His
fastball tonight was better than it has been all year. His stuff
was terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   Girardi said: ``If he has that stuff nine out of 10 times, we
win. Tonight just happened to be that one time. I'm baffled by it
to be honest.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite the wicked velocity on his fastball, Clemens'
control was a problem _ two of the batters he walked scored _ and
all five of the runs he surrendered came with two outs. When a
pitcher of Clemens' stature is on, that does not happen.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling heading into the game was that Girardi, who caught
Clemens' 8-inning, 0-run gem against Seattle last week, had
developed a chemistry with Clemens. Last week's game was the first
time in two-and-a- half months that Girardi caught Clemens. With
Clemens responding positively to the experienced Girardi, Torre
went with the battery again.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the move looked like it would pay off, as Clemens
threw with power in recording four strikeouts and allowing no hits
through the first three innings. But then he began to unravel. He
walked Rich Becker to start the fourth, then, after striking out
Randy Velarde, was hit hard for a single to center field by Jason
Giambi. Next, he walked Olmedo Saenz before Ben Grieve, who was
3-for-4, laced a ground-ball double down the third base line and
past a lunging Luis Sojo to score Becker and Giambi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had good stuff so I wanted to be aggressive,'' said Clemens,
who dropped to 12-7 with a 4.54 ERA. ``The first two runs they got
was just a good pitch and he fired it inside the line and that
really doesn't get you upset as much as the one where they kind of
broke the game open with the two other runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Those came in the sixth inning, when Clemens allowed Giambi to
single, walked Saenz and then was foiled again by Grieve after
serving up a two-run forkball for a single. Boos from the crowd of
34,468 came raining down on Clemens after that, and after watching
his pitcher walk Becker in the seventh and allow another run on a
Velarde double off the left field fence (just past the outstretched
glove of Ricky Ledee), Torre let Clemens finish out the inning and
then went to his bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a good job hitting the forkball,'' said Clemens, who
got a blister on the middle finger of his right hand late in the
game. ``He didn't try and pull it. I think if he gets anxious and
tries to pull it, I get the results I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   CHILI DAVIS &UR;  &LR; retired the league's longest streak without a
triple, a span of 2,216 at-bats, when he drilled an offering by
OMAR OLIVARES &UR;  &LR; high off the right-field fence. It was Davis' first
triple since May 11, 1994, when he played for the California
Angels.

SICK ANIMALS FIND FRIEND IN MONICA'S DAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DOMINIC BERBEO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In an only-in-L.A. confluence of national
celebrity and pampered pets, Monica Lewinsky's father has announced
plans to use his L.A. cancer clinic to help cure sick animals.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bernard Lewinsky is teaming with Dr. Rodney Ayl, a
veterinarian oncologist, to treat animals of all sizes, including
their latest patient, a snow leopard from Moonridge Animal Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many things happen in Los Angeles,'' Lewinsky said Wednesday
as he watched Ayl treating Chago the snow leopard for a cancerous
growth on the mouth. ``L.A. sets the pace for novel ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky said he was glad to be in the spotlight for something
other than the Monicagate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as hard as last year,'' he said. ``A total intrusion
and scrutiny of every aspect of our family was the last thing we
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Monica is ``doing fine'' in New York, and he expects her
to do well at her new business of selling handbags over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the focus was on pets as patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is coming to expect at least the same level of care
for their pets that they can get for themselves because they
consider them a member of the family,'' said Ayl.
</P>
<P>
   There are other locations offering cancer treatments for pets,
including UCLA Medical Center's new Veterinary Radiation Oncology
Facility, which treats dogs and cats.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ayl's clients, Steve Kokinis, said the therapy on his
9-year-old Samoyed named Gorbachev for a precancerous growth on his
jaw was well worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider Gorby to be like a member of the family,'' he said.
``The other alternative would have been to cut half his jaw off,
and I never would have done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kokinis said he came from Eagle Rock for the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Ayl said he uses chemotherapy to treat an average of eight to 10
pet patients a day, mostly dogs. He also has worked on more exotic
animals, such as the snow leopard, a boa constrictor and an
orangutan.
</P>
<P>
   The average cost: $3,000 for a full treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Ayl calculates the success rate for curing pets to be as high as
50 percent, depending on the type of cancer and stage of illness.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky said the idea to treat pets at the Western Tumor
Medical Group clinic came from several of his patients with pets,
who then put him in contact with Ayl.
</P>
<P>
   He said he rents equipment, including a $1 million linear
accelerator used for radiation treatments, to Ayl for treatment.
Sometimes he informally lends his expertise.
</P>
<P>
   More and more people are willing to pay the $3,000 for cancer
therapy for their pets, he said, roughly the same price as for
human treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Herron brought his 5-year-old Labrador retriever named
Cinder from Malibu for treatment of a cancerous growth on the nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't cheap, but it's worth it,'' he said. ``She's a great
dog, and she picks up my ducks when I go hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   As pet owners are increasingly willing to spend big money on
their animals, a new industry is blossoming in the form of
veterinary medical insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Ayl said many of his clients' pets are covered by insurance, and
Lewinsky said sometimes the animal policies pay higher
reimbursements than HMO policies for humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad comment on our society,'' he said.

BIGGEST UNION AT BOEING VOTES TO ACCEPT PROPOSED CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Ore., Kan.)  (js)

<P>
   Boeing &UR;  &LR; Co.'s largest union voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to
accept a proposed new three-year contract, averting a strike that
would have dealt a blow to Boeing's efforts to recover from an
embarrassing financial downturn.
</P>
<P>
   The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers, which represents 44,300 Boeing employees, mostly in the
flagship passenger jet division, said that the contract won the
endorsement of 86 percent of those who voted. A simple majority was
required for passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``While this is a great contract, our work is far from done,''
said Bill Johnson, the president of the Seattle-area local that
represents 31,000 Boeing workers. ``We need to work hard on behalf
of our members to enforce this contract and continue to protect the
jobs of our members.'' Workers in Spokane, Wash.; Wichita, Kan.,
and Portland, Ore., also participated in the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The union's leadership had strongly endorsed the proposed
contract, which Boeing put forward early Saturday morning after
nearly two weeks of intense bargaining at a hotel outside Seattle.
Johnson and other union leaders had predicted a strike only a few
hours before Boeing submitted its final offer, which included
concessions to the union.
</P>
<P>
   But an opposition faction within the union campaigned against
the contract, complaining that it did not secure strong enough
guarantees of job security and did not win cost of living increases
for retirees. In 1995, Johnson endorsed a proposed contract that
was later rejected by the membership, extending a strike that
eventually lasted 69 days.
</P>
<P>
   Had two-thirds of the union members voted against the contract,
a walkout could have begun as early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The new contract makes Boeing workers among the best paid in the
country, raising their hourly wages nearly 16 percent over three
years to an average of $24.35 an hour. The contract also raises
retirement benefits 25 percent and contains a one-time 10 percent
bonus that amounts to an average of $4,400 per worker.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Boeing abandoned an attempt to introduce weekend
shifts that would have reduced overtime payments and it failed to
get the union to agree to have its members shoulder some of the
cost of health insurance. The company agreed not to lay off any
workers as a result of a decision to subcontract work to
third-party manufacturers, though even the union leaders admitted
that the language they agreed to was not as firm as they had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors have expressed doubt that the new pact's
estimated cost of $600 million will be more than made up for
through increased productivity, as Philip M. Condit, Boeing's
chairman, has said.
</P>
<P>
   But the new agreement does give the company three years to work
with the union to raise profits following a production foul-up two
years ago that forced it to halt production of many of its jets
resulting in Boeing's first annual loss in 50 years.

CRUISING TO MEETING, L.A.'S TOP COP BUSTS TAGGER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It may have been a few years since LAPD Chief
Bernard C. Parks patrolled the streets, took radio calls and nabbed
(italics) perps (end italics), but the 30-year cop showed Wednesday
that he still can protect and serve.
</P>
<P>
   The city's top cop and his driver spotted and cuffed a tagger at
a traffic pole at Vernon Avenue and Leimert Boulevard _ Parks'
first arrest since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were driving to a 10 o'clock meeting and we saw all this
graffiti, and I remarked to myself that you never see the person
doing it,'' Parks said after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were about a mile from my house and when we got to the
intersection, we saw a guy up on a concrete light stand. By the
time we pulled up to the light, he came down and was oblivious to
everyone and kept writing on the pole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said let's call it in to get a Southwest unit out there,
when he started to walk away. We had to make a U-turn and then he
was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks said he and his driver, Andrea Balter, were looking up and
down the streets when they spotted the suspect, Herlindo Rodriguez,
using a marking pen with silver ink to tag buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said let's stop him. He'll escape before the unit gets
here,'' Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   The chief and Balter, both in casual civilian clothes, ordered
Rodriguez to stop when the 19-year-old suspect started to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grabbed his backpack and stopped him,'' Parks said. ``It
was when we got one cuff on him that he began to struggle.
Fortunately, a bystander came by and the three of us were able to
contain him.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks said he never identified himself as the chief of police to
Rodriguez, although he suspects the suspect later learned the
identity of the man who caught him.
</P>
<P>
   The chief said he was pleased he hadn't forgotten his basic
training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the instincts just kicked in,'' Parks said, adding he
was now preparing for the possibility of testifying in court as the
arresting officer.
</P>
<P>
   It also will cost Parks some.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got that ink all over my clothes.''

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Just to be on the safe side, Astros manager Larry Dierker should
consider getting an MRI on his right shoulder. Considering how many
times he waved a pitcher in from the bullpen Wednesday, there's at
least a slight chance of tendinitis.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Mets punished Chris Holt and most of the Astros'
bullpen in a 9-5 victory at the Astrodome. The Mets pumped out 18
hits _ eight of them for extra bases _ in taking the rubber game of
the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to give up 18 hits and win,'' Dierker said. ``On the
other hand, it's not often we score five runs and lose. That's
usually enough in this building.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza led the Mets' attack with four hits, and John
Olerud, Roger Cedeno and Robin Ventura had three each. Ventura
drove in four runs, contributing to the Astros' second horrid
pitching performance in three days.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorkers piled up 21 hits in Monday's 17-1 lashing and
outhit the Astros 46-19 in the three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very frustrating series,'' Astros left fielder Bill
Spiers said. ``We didn't control them very well. They got a lot of
hits and a lot of runs. They have a good offensive club.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, humbled yet again by an upper-echelon opponent,
should be pleased to see the bottom-feeding Expos on the schedule
after today's day off.
</P>
<P>
   By losing Wednesday, the Astros dropped the season series
against the Mets and assured themselves of having a losing record
against the four other playoff-contending teams _ Arizona, Atlanta,
Cincinnati and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's 8-7 victory over Cincinnati kept the first-place
Astros from losing any ground in the National League Central race.
The Astros maintained their 1{-game lead over the Reds. Atlanta
leads the Mets by 3{ games in the East.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to head-to-head meetings, the Astros can't
claim to be a leader: They are a combined 12-24 against the Braves,
Diamondbacks, Mets and Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little concerned about it,'' Dierker said. ``But not
that concerned. There are precedents of teams beating a team in the
playoffs that they didn't play well against during the regular
season. So I'm not worried about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt has been fairly consistent since the All-Star break, but
Wednesday's outing was reminiscent of his first-half struggles. The
Astros stayed close to the Mets early in the game and tied the
score at 3 in the fourth inning, but Holt gave it right back.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the part that killed me,'' said Holt, who allowed six
runs on 10 hits in four innings _ his shortest start of the season.
``We scored two runs to tie the game, and I didn't hold it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mets starter Octavio Dotel (6-1) wasn't razor-sharp, but
considering the way his teammates carved up Astros pitching he
could have been as dull as a butter knife and still earned the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's two-run homer opened the scoring in the second, but
the Astros cut the lead in half in the bottom of the inning with an
immediate contribution from newcomer Stan Javier.
</P>
<P>
   After drawing a one-out walk, Javier stole second, went to third
on Piazza's throwing error and scored on Paul Bako's chopper to
first base.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets reclaimed a two-run lead in the third when Olerud hit a
leadoff single and scored from third on Darryl Hamilton's
fielder's-choice grounder. The Astros tied the score in the fourth
on Jeff Bagwell's 39th homer and Javier's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell is four homers shy of matching his career high.
</P>
<P>
   But as they did all night, the Mets answered the Astros' rally
with RBI singles by Ventura, Shawon Dunston and Cedeno to make the
score 6-3 in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Holt (3-13) didn't retire any of the three batters he faced in
the fifth inning and was replaced by Brian Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Cabrera, Doug Henry, Trever Miller and Jay Powell also took
turns on the mound. Sometimes it takes Dierker a week to use that
many relief pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the day off, we could use up the whole bullpen,''
Dierker said. ``It's no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Dotel was replaced by Pat Mahomes after the Astros loaded the
bases with no one out in the sixth inning. Mahomes yielded a
sacrifice fly to Javier and coaxed Bako into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets added two more runs in the eighth, and Derek Bell's
ground ball plated the Astros' final run in the bottom of the
inning.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
STEVE Francis' welcome visit to Houston this week happened to
coincide perfectly with the news that a deal on a new downtown
office for him and his future Rockets playmates had come to pass,
the obligatory late snag or two notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   And on Nov. 2, the day when Houston voters will go to the polls
to decide whether the palatial arena can actually be built, Francis
will make his Rockets debut against Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   An accidental convergence, perhaps, but a most fitting one,
isn't it? Bless the Rockets for their timing and their knack for
making big headlines exactly when they must have them.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, buffeted by a summer of angst and discord, was
seeking a tangible link to its future and a reason to get recharged
about the present. The Francis trade, another in what is becoming a
series of Rockets offseason blockbusters, works on both counts. It
should assist to some degree in turning the $160 million arena into
a reality and, ultimately, assist in justifying its existence.
</P>
<P>
   Hakeem Olajuwon and Charles Barkley _ and probably Scottie
Pippen, too _ won't be around to represent our fair city when the
facility opens in the fall of 2003. If, however, the basketball
experts are right about Francis, the reluctant Canuck turned
rejoicing Rocket, he will be Houston's showcase performer when the
gala grand opening is staged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tapes we've seen of him,'' said coach Rudy Tomjanovich,
looking about 10 years younger himself, ``are just unbelievable, as
impressive as any I've ever watched of a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to describe himself, Francis suggests he is a cross
between Stephon Marbury and Allen Iverson. Should he prove to be _
admittedly something of a tall order _ we won't remember the price
the Rockets had to pay to get him. Michael Dickerson and Othella
Harrington are would-be NBA stars themselves, but neither possesses
the sky's-the-limit upside Stevie Wonder does.
</P>
<P>
   He figures to be the point guard in a couple of types of
transition games. With the Rockets' Hall of Fame frontcourt loping
toward the sunset, they needed a young gun to re-energize them, to
pick their plodding tempo way up. We only hope the old codgers,
particularly Olajuwon, can keep pace with him. The 15 seasons'
worth of mileage on Hakeem's knees don't bode well for his easily
adjusting to how the Rockets will have to play to maximize Francis'
exuberant, go-to-the-hole offensive style.
</P>
<P>
   Also, will Olajuwon accept the lad's leadership? Francis' first
appearance before the local media Monday night proved at once
disarming and disconcerting. His charming smile and polite,
respectful responses to questions countered the spoiled-brat image
that his refusal to accept Vancouver's money had cloaked him in
since the draft. But it caused no small measure of concern as well.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, he looks really, really young. Like about 16 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Once he proves he can play old, though, everything will be fine.
Barkley, assuming he re-signs (and all indications are he will),
can be the big brother Francis sorely needs to adjust to the NBA
whirl. Much about Sir Charles' fun-loving, night-prowling spirit
may suggest his being a wayward influence on Francis, but exactly
the opposite will be the case. Assuming Francis deigns to listen,
of course.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley will be watching Francis' every move, from how he
dresses to with whom he hangs. If Charles doesn't approve of what
he sees, be it related to hoops or Francis' boys from the 'hood,
there will be animated discussions regarding same.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame the last All-America point guard from Maryland that
the Rockets landed didn't have a Chuckster in his sphere during his
most impressionable years. John Lucas' wayward, largely squandered
NBA career, although it would be eventually redeemed in part,
remains one of Houston's ranking sports tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, in tandem with Moses Malone, should have led the Rockets
to at least one NBA championship. But remember, his downward spiral
didn't begin until the NBA arbitrarily sent him to Golden State as
compensation for the Rockets' signing Rick Barry. He never got a
chance to finish what he started in Houston until it was much too
late, until cocaine already owned his soul.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Lucas' long-ago sins need not be revisited upon Francis,
who wasn't yet born when Luke was drafted first by Houston in 1976.
Although he hails from a rough background, and his petulant
rejection of Vancouver, a beautiful and cultured city, did raise a
small red flag regarding his attitude, Francis deserves to start
with a clean slate here.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are you will find him likable, as both a person and a
player. But can he be the next franchise cornerstone, a talent
worthy of the mansion the team and the city hope to build around
him? Come Election Day, we start finding out.

USC'S RIDEAUX OUT OF OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Highly regarded freshman defensive back Darrell Rideaux will
miss Saturday's game against Hawaii with a lingering back injury
that could put him out indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Rideaux is still bothered by a stress injury suffered at the
state track championships in June, when he got tangled with another
runner on a relay, and was accidentally kneed in the back. There
has been speculation that Rideaux might have to consider
redshirting, if the injury does not improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those injuries that's been plaguing me,'' Rideaux
said. ``It stiffens up. There's sharp pain. I think it's premature
to make assumptions. At this point, I'm on pins on needles.''
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett said Rideaux will rest next week, when
USC has a bye, and then see if he can play Sept. 18 against San
Diego State. If he's still not ready, Hackett said he would play
the following week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly a blow,'' Hackett said. ``(But the doctors)
seem to think it's not super serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said the injury is similar to one suffered by Chad
Morton last season, when he was hit in the back against Florida
State.
</P>
<P>
   Rideaux wasn't sure how long he would be out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they find the problem, we can address it and go from
there,'' Rideaux said.
</P>
<P>
   With Rideaux out, Eric Reese and Tanqueray Clark will be used at
the nickel back, and freshman Kevin Arbet will also play.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 tailback update: Hackett said sophomore Malaefou MacKenzie
will be USC's No. 2 tailback in goal-line situations, with either
Frank Strong or Sultan McCullough the second-string back in normal
situations.
</P>
<P>
   Newbury makes move: Sophomore David Newbury seemed to take a
step forward in the kicking battle with junior David Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Newbury made three field goals between 47-50 yards while Bell
was one for three on his attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just decided to do what I knew I could do,'' Newbury said.
``They brought me out here for a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said a decision would likely come today, when the team
arrives in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Trojans take 80: USC will take 80 players to Hawaii, leaving
behind only injured players and walk-ons.

MAVERICKS SEND GREEN TO LAKERS FOR ROOKS, DRAFT PICK
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Don Nelson acquired former Dallas Mavericks center Sean
Rooks and a second-round draft pick next year in a sign-and-trade
deal Wednesday with the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson signed free-agent forward A.C. Green, then traded him to
the Lakers for Rooks, who also can play power forward. Green
returns to the team that drafted him in the first round (23rd
overall) in 1985, while Rooks returns to the franchise that drafted
him in the second round (30th overall) in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very fortunate to have acquired Sean Rooks,'' said
Nelson, the Mavericks' coach and general manager. ``Sean will be a
replacement for Samaki Walker and A.C. Green, whom we lost through
free agency, and he will beef up our front line.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-10, 260-pound Rooks, who turns 30 on Sept. 9, is
scheduled to earn $1.9 million in the 1999-2000 season. His
seven-year, $13.4 million contract expires after the 2002-2003
season.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Rooks averaged 2.7 points, two rebounds and 8.8
minutes in 36 games. In 410 NBA games with four teams, the six-year
veteran has averaged 8.0 points and 4.6 rebounds in 20.3 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Rooks ``will play two positions for us _ backup center and power
forward,'' Nelson said. ``Sean has the ability to score in the low
box, is an excellent passer, and is a fine addition to our young
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Rook's most productive years were with the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   As a rookie, Rooks averaged 13.5 points and 7.4 rebounds, and
shot 49.3 percent from the field. He appeared to be the center the
Mavericks needed since the days of James Donaldson.
</P>
<P>
   However, after Rooks averaged 11.4 points and 5.5 rebounds and
shot 49.1 percent in his second season with the Mavericks, they
traded him to Minnesota on Nov. 1, 1994 for a conditional
first-round draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   Rooks stayed less than two seasons with the Timberwolves before
he was traded to Atlanta on Feb. 22, 1996, for Spud Webb, Christian
Laettner and Andrew Lang. The Lakers signed Rooks as a free agent
on July 16, 1996, and he spent the past three seasons with the
Lakers, where he was unhappy with his playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Last season Green averaged 4.9 points and 4.6 rebounds in just
18.5 minutes per game and was one of the team's most popular
players after arriving on Dec. 26, 1996 from Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Green helped the Lakers win back-to-back NBA titles in 1987 and
'88, and has played in an NBA-record 1,028 consecutive games. He
also has a clothing company located in Compton, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks' only remaining free agent is forward Ansu Sesay,
who has worked out for Philadelphia 76ers coach Larry Brown.

MARINERS SWEEP BACK OVER .500

   CHICAGO _ Gil Meche ate junk food but didn't get a stomachache.
He ran with scissors but didn't stab himself. He bought a BB gun
but didn't shoot his eye out.
</P>
<P>
   Or the baseball equivalent, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners rookie right-hander picked a dangerous way to pitch
the Chicago White Sox Wednesday night. He walked eight hitters, the
most by a Mariner this season, but did not suffer for his sin.
Meche beat the White Sox, 3-2, and the Mariners completed a
four-game sweep that put them over .500 for the first time since
July 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got confused with his stats _ he walked eight and struck
out one, instead of vice versa,'' pitching coach Stan Williams
said. ``Vice versa is what he's capable of. But thank God for four
double plays and the pickoff at second base. It wasn't easy, but it
turned out all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams thought Meche had his best bullpen warmup of the season
Wednesday, locating his pitches and throwing very hard. If he had
carried the same stuff into the game, Williams said, the White Sox
wouldn't have touched him.
</P>
<P>
   When he took the mound, Meche said he felt he would have a good
day. But soon after Mike Caruso bunted for an out on the game's
first pitch, Meche realized something had changed. Liu Rodriguez
walked on a borderline full-count pitch, and a long night had
begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got it in my head that I was walking people,'' Meche said,
``and it just took off.''
</P>
<P>
   Magglio Ordonez also walked, but Paul Konerko grounded into a
double play, ending the inning. That foretold the rest of the
night; Meche used double plays to survive the third, fourth and
sixth innings, and he picked Mark Johnson off second to stifle a
rally in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The final double play was spectacular, to use manager Lou
Piniella's word. Second baseman David Bell, who was covering second
with Ordonez running, fielded Konerko's grounder just to the
shortstop side of the bag. Falling down, he slapped the base with
his glove, then threw from his knees to get Konerko easily at
first. Bell said he'd never made a play quite like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really don't work on a play like that,'' he said. ``It's
just kind of a freak play.''
</P>
<P>
   And Meche's victory was a freak outcome. He said he could not
remember the last time he walked eight in a game, and was
frustrated that he was still fighting himself on the mound, as he
did in a blowout loss at New York last week. Meche has allowed
three runs or fewer in seven of his 10 starts, but he has 41 walks
to 29 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if (I'm) just trying to do too much or just
falling out of rhythm,'' said Meche. ``I'm just not making good
pitches. If Meche sounded down, Piniella was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw exceptionally hard today, and he pitched mostly with
his fastball,'' Piniella said. ``He's got a good arm. He's got to
harness it and throw more strikes, naturally. But it was
impressive. He got out of it when he had to.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said of the Mariners hitters. Handcuffed by
Mike Sirotka's cut fastballs for six innings, Seattle got all its
runs in the seventh. Edgar Martinez homered on a 3-and-2 fastball
that caught too much of the plate, and Jay Buhner followed with
another full-count homer, on a changeup. With two outs, Russ Davis,
Brian Hunter and Bell singled for the Mariners' third run.
</P>
<P>
   Sirotka (8-12) walked none in his seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Meche left the game in the seventh, after Craig Wilson walked
and Johnson singled. Jose Paniagua came in and struck out Caruso,
whose two-strike bunt rolled foul, then faced Frank Thomas, who was
batting for Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas had been heckled all series at Comiskey Park, and was
hitless in 11 at-bats over the first three games. He had a
25-minute early batting practice session Wednesday and was held out
of the starting lineup to ``ease his mind,'' manager Jerry Manuel
said.
</P>
<P>
   Batting as the go-ahead run, Thomas had a chance for something
dramatic but never swung the bat. Paniagua fell behind 3 and 1,
then nicked the bottom inside corner of the strike zone twice with
called-strike fastballs. Thomas argued, and was booed heavily as he
slowly retreated to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was looking for something outside,'' Paniagua said, ``so
(catcher Dan Wilson) told me to throw him fastballs middle-in.''
</P>
<P>
   Magglio Ordonez singled in a run, but Konerko grounded into a
fielder's choice to end the inning. Paniagua worked a scoreless
eighth, again striking out two, and Jose Mesa earned his 31st save
with a 1-2-3 ninth.

RANGERS OVERCOME EARLY DEFICIT TO BEAT TIGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Detroit's Dean Palmer and Tony Clark punished the
facade of Tiger Stadium's upper deck with mammoth, first- and
third-inning home runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers' Damion Easley deposited another home run into the
left field's upper-deck seating bowl on the first pitch after
Clark's third-inning blast, and yet no one stirred in the Rangers'
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a long man out there tonight,'' Rangers manager
Johnny Oates explained.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers didn't need one.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Rick Helling battened down the hatches and retired
13 of the next 16 batters, and the Rangers rallied for a 14-7
victory Wednesday night at Tiger Stadium. Helling, who hasn't lost
since June 21, is 6-0 in his past 13 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key for me was Rick being able to right himself after
those back-to-back home runs,'' Oates said. ``If he continues to
struggle out there, I don't know what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's game depleted the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Mike Morgan, who pitched himself out of the
rotation with Tuesday's start, threw 55 pitches and could not be
used in long relief.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Danny Kolb threw 41 pitches in relief of Morgan and
could not be used in long relief. Left-hander Jeff Fassero threw 19
pitches Tuesday in what was his second appearance since Saturday
and could not be used in long relief.
</P>
<P>
   That made the Tigers' 5-1, third-inning advantage all the more
troublesome unless you're last name rhymed with shelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt great out there,'' Helling said. ``I really wasn't in
any trouble. It's not like they were (hitting) me to death. I was
pitching pretty well. I honestly felt like I only made four or five
mistakes during those first three innings, and three of those four
or five mistakes were hit out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew things would get better if I kept making good pitches,
and eventually they did. Then, I was able to throw some zeros up
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers countered with a barrage of clutch, two-out hits
that accounted for four of their first six runs. Second baseman
Mark McLemore produced the first with his two-out, third-inning
single that scored center fielder Tom Goodwin.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve catcher Gregg Zaun, who hit a home run and drove in a
career-best four runs, and Goodwin delivered consecutive two-out,
run-scoring singles in the fourth inning before right fielder Juan
Gonzalez tied the score with his fifth-inning, solo home run.
</P>
<P>
   Tigers right-hander Jeff Weaver (8-10) surrendered the lead when
Goodwin delivered a two-out, sixth-inning triple that scored
shortstop Royce Clayton and gave the Rangers a lead that never
would be relinquished.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just happened to come through and get some clutch hits
tonight,'' said Goodwin, who went 3-for-6 with a double and triple.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Helling (12-7) continued to record outs en route to a
seven-inning appearance, and the Rangers finally popped
right-handers Doug Brocail and Masao Kida for eight runs, which
included Luis Alicea's home run, in the final two innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``To give up six earned runs sucks,'' Helling said, ``but to get
a win out of it makes it a little more bearable.'' nn

STARS SIGN FORWARD PROSPECTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Stars yesterday drew closer to pulling
together their training-camp roster when they signed forward
prospects Warren Luhning and Keith Aldridge to new contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The signings leave only goalie Manny Fernandez and defenseman
Richard Matvichuk unsigned heading into the beginning of training
camp Sunday in Vail, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Matvichuk is in Edmonton, Alberta, working out with the Fort
Saskatchewan Traders, a Tier II team, as his negotiations have
moved slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to be with the guys, but I'm not going to be there
without a contract,'' said Matvichuk, who is a restricted free
agent. ``I'm just going to work hard and keep myself in shape and
be ready whenever this deal gets done.''
</P>
<P>
   Aldridge and Luhning will be tossed into a dogfight to grab one
of the Stars' open forward positions.
</P>
<P>
   Aldridge (5-foot-11, 192) is an interesting prospect as a
defenseman whom the Stars hope to convert to forward _ the same way
they did with Blake Sloan last season. Aldridge had 15 goals and 28
assists, along with 130 penalty minutes, in 66 games with the
Vipers last season. He played at Lake Superior State University and
was a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award, given to the top player
in NCAA hockey, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Luhning, 24, was acquired by the Stars from the New York
Islanders in the off-season for a third-round draft pick. The 6-2,
185-pound right winger has played 11 NHL games with no points and
last season scored 20 goals and added 20 assists in 56 games with
the Kentucky Thoroughblades. Luhning played four seasons at the
University of Michigan, where he helped win two NCAA championships
and was a teammate of Stars players Sloan and Marty Turco.
\Nsubheds:Ludwig retires Craig Ludwig said he has officially
retired as a defenseman and taken a position within the Stars
organization that will be focused primarily on scouting.
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig, 38, finished his 17-year NHL career a member of two
Stanley Cup championship teams ('86 Montreal Canadiens and '99
Stars).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great ride and I'm ready to step into another part of
life,'' he said. ``I think what it came down to was I really wanted
to be a part of this organization and continue to build what
they're building here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig had been told by the Stars he would not be offered a new
contract this season, but had discussions with the Chicago
Blackhawks and Detroit Red Wings concerning one-season deals. He
said he decided against playing for another team because he said he
felt he would be ``betraying'' the Stars. \Nsubheds:Hull changes
number Brett Hull officially changed his number from 22 to 16
yesterday. Hull had worn 16 his entire career before coming to the
Stars as a free agent last season. He wore No. 22 because Pat
Verbeek already had No. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Verbeek is not returning to the Stars this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, with this change, maybe I'll get 80 \Rgoals\S this
year,'' Hull joked. ``I can feel the difference already.''
\Nsubheds:Rookie camp set The Stars have scheduled a two-day rookie
camp today and tomorrow at the Dr Pepper StarCenter. Eighteen
players are expected to participate, including top prospects Jon
Sim, Marty Turco, Richard Jackman, Roman Lyashenko, Steve Gainey
and Brenden Morrow.

HIT-AND-RUN LEAVES TRAIL OF HEARTACHE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was every motorist's nightmare: Yvette
Villalobos was driving with her 5-year-old daughter when the car
stalled in the slow lane of the Hollywood Freeway.
</P>
<P>
   Villalobos got out to investigate and stepped in front of her
car when a hit-and-run driver slammed into the rear of her car,
bouncing her off the windshield and onto the ground, authorities
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Villalobos' daughter was in the front seat wearing her seat belt
and suffered only minor injuries, but she saw her mother get hit.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds after the 8:40 p.m. crash Tuesday, the Lincoln Town
Car's driver walked over to Villalobos' mangled car, saw her lying
on the pavement, saw the girl in the front seat _ and then ran,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators looked for a suspect until a 19-year-old man,
identified as Armen Tagvoryan of Panorama City, surrendered to them
around 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at the California Highway Patrol office
in Woodland Hills, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   After the crash Tuesday evening, the girl, Lauren Gutierrez,
squeezed out of the wreckage, sat by her mother briefly and then
desperately tried to stop cars, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally a good Samaritan and her son stopped and found
Villalobos unconscious and the child in shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was asking my son, Is my mom dead? And she said she wanted
her daddy,'' recalled the first person to stop, Lucia Vargas
Velasco.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old Villalobos, a resident of Los Angeles, died
about 4 p.m. Wednesday of her injuries. ``She was in very bad
shape,'' Velasco said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, with her husband at her side, Villalobos' family
allowed her to be removed from life support at Providence Holy
Cross Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The girl is extremely traumatized. ``She was very upset. She
knows what happened and the condition of her mom,'' said California
Highway Patrol Officer Richard Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators searched through the day for Tagvoryan, who they
first described as a ``possible suspect'' who might have been
driving the car.
</P>
<P>
   Tagvoryan's wallet and identification and other paperwork was
left in the silver convertible blue-top Lincoln. Additionally, hair
and blood evidence from when the driver hit the windshield likely
will be taken from the Lincoln, officers said.
</P>
<P>
   About a half-hour after the crash, Mger Tagvoryan, who is Armen
Tagvoryan's brother and the Lincoln's registered owner, reported
his vehicle stolen, said CHP Lt. Bruce Moncher.
</P>
<P>
   At least one witness gave authorities a description of the
driver who plowed into Villalobos' Nissan Sentra.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Lincoln's driver) walked to the victim's vehicle and
observed her there, helpless, with the child left to see her mother
dying on the ground. It really upsets me,'' said California Highway
Patrol Capt. Les Fritz.
</P>
<P>
   The Highway Patrol investigators issued a statement Wednesday
evening thanking Armen Tagvoryan's family and friends who assisted
the Highway Patrol in efforts to have the suspect surrender.
</P>
<P>
   If the driver had remained at the crash scene, he might have
faced minor charges or none at all, said CHP Sgt. Steve Munday.
</P>
<P>
   The Highway Patrol officials said Wednesday night that the
suspect was taken into custody on suspicion of hit-and-run driving
and that he might face other charges.
</P>
<P>
   Officers and civilians at the West Valley CHP office struggled
to understand how the driver could leave the mother and child
behind without attempting to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's barbaric and inhumane to watch a person dying there and
not do anything,'' said CHP Sgt. John Lago.

OATES HUNTS STARTER AS MORGAN DEMOTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Johnny Paul 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ A gruesome August doomed right-hander Mike Morgan to
the Rangers' bullpen for September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to Mike, and he will not start Sunday,'' Rangers
manager Johnny Oates said yesterday. ``I don't know who will.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan pitched himself out of the rotation with Tuesday's
performance in the Rangers' 14-6 loss to Detroit at Tiger Stadium.
Morgan did not figure in the decision, but the 39-year-old veteran
surrendered six runs (four earned) on seven hits and two walks in
his 31/3-inning appearance.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the sixth time in as many starts during August that
Morgan (12-8, 6.23) failed to pitch more than five innings, and his
10.80 earned-run average for that period forced Oates to make a
change.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers will require a fifth starter only four times for the
remainder of the regular season, and that turn in the rotation
could become what Oates described as the ``pitcher du jour.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers will require that ``pitcher du jour'' for the first
time Sunday against the Chicago White Sox at The Ballpark in
Arlington, and right-hander Danny Kolb appears to be the leading
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Kolb is 1-1 with a 4.24 ERA in nine relief appearances spanning
231/3 innings this season, and opponents are hitting .233 against
the 24-year-old rookie.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox entered last night's game with a 15-7 record
during games in which their opponent started a left-hander on the
mound and 47-64 against right-handers.
</P>
<P>
   That could eliminate left-hander Jeff Fassero, whom the Rangers
acquired Friday from the Seattle Mariners. Fassero went 0-2 with a
6.23 ERA during two starts this season against the White Sox while
pitching for the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's record against left-handers also could prevent
left-hander Matt Perisho of Triple-A Oklahoma from starting that
game. Perisho, who won his 15th game Sunday for the RedHawks,
likely will be recalled from Oklahoma this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Ryan Glynn also could be an option, but the
24-year-old rookie took the loss during the Rangers' 7-4 loss to
the White Sox Aug. 13 at Comiskey Park. Glynn surrendered seven
runs (six earned) on nine hits and three walks in that five-inning
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Oates said he plans to discuss the alternatives with his
coaching staff, general manager Doug Melvin and Oklahoma manager
Greg Biagini before making a decision.

BLOWERS BACK FOR THIRD STINT WITH MARINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Mike Blowers will have a whole new vantage point when
he goes to Safeco Field today.
</P>
<P>
   The Hanshin Tigers of Japan's Central League released Blowers in
early August, and he was home in Graham, Wash., waiting out the
Japanese waiver process during a recent Mariners homestand. So
Blowers and his wife attended a game, watching from the stands.
</P>
<P>
   The ballpark was ``perfect,'' he said, and as the starting third
baseman for the 1995 M's, Blowers couldn't help feeling a small
sense of ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody that was a part of that team does,'' said
Blowers, before making his debut with the '99 Mariners Wednesday
night. ``I certainly do, absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, I probably wanted it more than most guys, just because
I'm from there and that's where I'm going to live the rest of my
life. I was glad to see it done, and it was a fun time of my life
to be a part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Blowers, who attended Bethel High School, Tacoma Community
College and the University of Washington, signed with the Mariners
Saturday and will give the team a right-handed-hitting first
baseman for September. In 73 games in Japan, he batted .251 with 10
homers and 43 runs batted in. He made more money than he could have
if he'd signed with a major league team last winter, he said, but
the experience was not fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really enjoy it,'' Blowers said. ``It's an experience
_ I went over there, and I'm glad I'm back in the States.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese game focuses more on pitching and defense, Blowers
said, and teams typically play for one run at a time. The
atmosphere was exciting _ the Tigers drew 50,000 fans a game _ but
the style of play did not suit Blowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organization over there treated me great,'' he said.
``They did everything first-class for me and my family. I just
couldn't really ever get into the flow of the game over there. It's
a little different brand of baseball, and I didn't enjoy it. And
for the first time in my career, the manager and I didn't get along
very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Blowers, who played third base in Japan, was with the Mariners
from 1992-95 and again in 1997. He spent last season with the
Oakland Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   STARK REALITY: The Mariners promoted right-hander Dennis Stark
from Class AA New Haven when rosters expanded Wednesday. Stark, a
24-year-old sinker/slider pitcher who will work out of the bullpen
for the M's, will be the Mariners' 28th pitcher this season when he
makes his debut. The major league record is 29, set by the 1996
Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``He finished up strong in double-A,'' Piniella said. ``He's got
a good, young arm, and the organization wants to give him some
experience. We like his future.''
</P>
<P>
   Stark, 24, pitched complete games in two of his last three
starts, finishing 9-11 with a 4.40 earned run average for New
Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Also promoted Wednesday was outfielder/infielder Charles Gipson,
who had rehab assignments at three minor league levels after
separating his shoulder on July 11.
</P>
<P>
   TAKING A LOOK: The Mariners are evaluating their interest in
right-hander Sean Bergman, who was released by Houston Tuesday.
Bergman, who is 29 years old and still a year away from free
agency, was 12-9 with a 3.72 ERA as a starter for the Astros last
year. He slipped to 4-6, 5.36 this season, missing more than a
month with shoulder tightness and losing his spot in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   FEELING BLUE: Piniella has had plenty of run-ins with umpires,
but he said he was saddened to learn that baseball had accepted the
resignations of 22 umpires.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad, it really is,'' Piniella said. `` ... Some of those
guys are my friends, and I hate to see them lose their jobs like
that. I have sympathy for them, because a lot of them have been on
the job a long time, and there are some good umpires. I hope this
thing gets resolved we get some of these people back.''

COWBOYS OWNER POSITIVE ABOUT QUENTIN CORYATT'S RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Ray Buck and Clarence E. Hill Jr. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Linebacker Quentin Coryatt's chronic Achilles' tendinitis is not
being viewed as a lingering preseason negative around Valley Ranch,
but rather ``a bonus'' for the Cowboys whenever Coryatt gets
healthy, defensive coordinator Dave Campo said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys never thought Coryatt was retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jerry Jones didn't have to talk the 29-year-old Coryatt
out of retirement during their one-hour meeting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just worried about what his teammates might be thinking
of him and his situation,'' Jones said. ``He's the type of player
who worries that he might be letting somebody down. People who have
high expectations often are harsh on themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Darren Hambrick, who has impressed coach Chan Gailey and the
Cowboys coaching staff all summer with his change in attitude and
his improved work ethic, has become the starter at strongside
linebacker. Hambrick, a 1998 fifth-round pick, has had eight
tackles in four games this preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Campo said, ``I'm comfortable with the guys we got. I told our
players to just think of \RCoryatt's injury absence\S as a bonus
when we get him, not a negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey remembers Coryatt reeking havoc against Pittsburgh when
Gailey was a coach with the Steelers and Coryatt played for the
Indianapolis Colts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have a chance of getting a healthy Quentin Coryatt at
some point, we'll take that,'' Gailey said. ``I'm not worried. I
understand Quentin's situation. I feel for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Coryatt signed a one-year contract with a two-year option with
the Cowboys in April after being released by the Colts and spending
all last season out of football because of reconstructive shoulder
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   His frustration is compounded by his not having played since
1997. His last full season was '95.
</P>
<P>
   The former Texas A&AMP;M star has a $400,000 base salary. He was
given a $1-million signing bonus, but Jones isn't worried about the
investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be patient and conservative,'' Jones said.
\Nsubheds:No interest in Jones
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jerry Jones said the Cowboys have made no contact with the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers regarding defensive tackle Marvin Jones.
</P>
<P>
   According to a source, the Cowboys were one of three teams to
express interest in acquiring the former North Carolina star.
</P>
<P>
   But Jerry Jones said the Cowboys are happy with the defensive
linemen on the roster and have not talked to Tampa Bay about
shoring up the position. \Nsubheds:Briefly Cowboys coach Chan
Gailey said he will wait until game time before deciding whether
receiver Ernie Mills (hamstring) and linebacker Randall Godfrey
(ankle) will play against the Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Chris Warren, who is still hampered by a sore groin
and suffered a neck strain last Sunday against the Denver Broncos,
is expected to play against the Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys signed rookie free-agent cornerback Marvin Love, who
was released by the St. Louis Rams, and waived cornerback
LaDouphyous McCalla.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Hayward Clay had successful surgery yesterday to
repair a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee.

MEXICAN PRESIDENT PROMISES A CLEANER ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to insert 4 new grafs before last graf of original text to
add reporting on disruptions during Zedillo's address. ) (mk) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ President Ernesto Zedillo, in a state of the union
address delivered as the race to choose his successor reaches full
swing, promised to insure a ``climate of freedom'' for the vote and
to prevent government funds from seeping into political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can all be confident that a democratically legitimate
government will emerge from these elections,'' Zedillo said
Wednesday night in the packed chambers of the lower house of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   His words conveyed the promise of an enormous step forward for
Mexico, which has been ruled for most of the last 70 years by a
single authoritarian party that has renewed its dominion every six
years in often-tainted elections.
</P>
<P>
   The speech is the culminating rite of the annual political
calendar. This address, the fifth in Zedillo's six-year term, was
especially important. It was his last before the election in July,
and therefore it was his final chance to speak above the racket of
the most competitive presidential campaign modern Mexico has seen,
and to put forth his achievements.
</P>
<P>
   But true to his down-to-earth, almost anti-political style,
Zedillo made no effort to give a stirring performance and limited
himself largely to a bland recitation of facts and figures.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, who strikes many Mexicans as a hard-working,
unpretentious and relatively honest politician, is enjoying the
highest popularity of his term. A national poll in in the newspaper
Reforma on Wednesday showed that 66 percent of those interviewed
approved of his performance in office. His ratings have
consistently climbed since he hit a low in December 1995, in the
midst of a crushing economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   A Yale-educated economist, Zedillo used the central passages of
his speech to highlight the sustained growth that his disciplined
fiscal policies have produced despite economic tumult in Asia,
Russia and Brazil and the plunge in world oil prices earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   He said Mexico would meet its goals of 3 percent growth and 13
percent inflation this year. He once again rejected any form of
currency controls and said the peso would continue to float freely.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, even though Mexico will be in a campaign year, when
past governments could not resist the temptation to send a little
extra money to vote-getting social programs, Zedillo intends to
reduce the budget deficit, from 1 1/4 percent to 1 percent of the
gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes without saying that no public funds will be diverted
to campaigns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo had sharp though indirect words for presidential
aspirants from the opposition, but also for figures in his own
party like Roberto Madrazo Pintado, who have criticized his
economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Destruction is what inevitably happens, and is what we
Mexicans have experienced again and again, when irresponsibility,
demagoguery, populism and an unhealthy desire for easily won praise
become the rule in economic management,'' Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
   He did not discuss his role in the elections. Many observers
wonder whether he will intervene with his still-vast powers to
favor a candidate whom he likes. But Zedillo did promise that he
would ``scrupulously respect all parties and all candidates'' and
do what he could to guarantee a clean vote.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition lawmakers who spoke before his speech expressed
skepticism about Zedillo's commitment to a fair election and to
refraining from exercising his presidential clout.
</P>
<P>
   ``This president still wants us to believe that there is no
other power than his, as in the old days,'' said Pablo Gomez
Alvarez, a leader of the left-of-center opposition.
</P>
<P>
   He and other opponents criticized Zedillo for blocking an
electoral reform that would have made it much easier for opposition
groups to form coalitions against the president's party.
</P>
<P>
   Most Mexicans believe that Carlos Salinas de Gortari won the
election in 1988 by fraud. Even Zedillo's rise to power in 1994 was
shadowed by the assassination in mid-campaign of the man who had
been his party's candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio.
</P>
<P>
   In a moment of candor, Zedillo conceded that his anti-crime
programs have not worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is with great regret that I must acknowledge that the state
has not yet met this demand of the Mexican people,'' he said. He
detailed a series of legal changes that have made it slightly
easier for police to arrest and jail criminals, as well as purges
of local and federal police forces intended to encourage a greater
focus on fighting crime.
</P>
<P>
   In an unabashed effort to upstage Zedillo before the television
cameras, Vicente Fox Quesada, an opposition presidential candidate,
marched out in the middle of the president's speech saying he had
``more important things to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo had to stop speaking several times because of catcalls
from opposition lawmakers, especially when he said that he had
never used government funds to help his own political party.
</P>
<P>
   But mayhem broke out on the floor during the rebuttal by Carlos
Medina Plascencia, a leader of the right-of-center opposition, who
accused Zedillo of covering up ``an enormous plundering of the
national treasury'' in the finances of his 1994 presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo's supporters drowned out Medina's speech with deafening
shouts.
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuous for their absence from Zedillo's address were
references to other pressing issues like the four-month-old student
strike that appears to be permanently injuring the National
Autonomous University, Latin America's largest; the strife with
Zapatista rebels in the state of Chiapas, and the congressional
struggle to shore up the banking system.

FINAL PRESEASON GAME CRITICAL TO MANY DALLAS COWBOYS PLAYERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ There has never been a mystery about the last
game of the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   For entrenched stars such as Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman and
running back Emmitt Smith, it doesn't mean much. And with the
team's regular-season hopes riding on their health, they usually
see little action. Exhibition games like Thursday night's matchup
between the Cowboys and Jacksonville Jaguars at Texas Stadium are
for guys on the roster bubble.
</P>
<P>
   Players like former TCU receiver Jason Tucker, defensive tackle
Brandon Noble and linebacker//fullback Robert Thomas know it's
their last chance to impress the coaches. The Cowboys have to
reduce their roster from 70 to 53 by Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some positions and people we are looking at,'' said
coach Chan Gailey, who said the starters will play about one
quarter, leaving the reserves three quarters to make a final
impression. ``This game will weigh heavily on them making it or not
making it.''
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, it's the game of their football lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just hope you do good enough to impress the coaches,''
Noble said. ``Or you hope to get good film to hook on somewhere
else. If not, you go home and get a good job and your first dream
dies.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gailey wouldn't go that far, he acknowledged the necessity
to make tough decisions to help the team that aren't always fair to
the individual. With the uncertain status of injured cornerbacks
Deion Sanders and Kevin Smith and defensive tackle Leon Lett's
suspension, Gailey said that being the best player might not mean
making the cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a chess game right to the end,'' Gailey said. ``You would
hope that everyone is healthy and you can take the best player. But
sometimes you got to cut a good football player because you need to
keep someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker finds himself caught in such a numbers game at receiver.
</P>
<P>
   He's had a solid preseason, catching five passes for 106 yards,
including a 55-yard touchdown pass. His average yards per catch of
21.2 is the most on the team for anyone with more than one
reception.
</P>
<P>
   And he amazed the coaches by quickly grasping Gailey's intricate
offense despite spending the spring in NFL Europe. Ernie Mills and
Jeff Ogden are the only other receivers to know all four wide
receiver positions. But both of them played last season.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Tucker may be the odd man out behind Mills, Ogden, Michael
Irvin, Raghib Ismail and Wane McGarity if the Cowboys keep five
receivers. If they keep six, they may opt for rookie MarTay
Jenkins, who has blazing speed and could be a better special teams
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all part of the business,'' said Tucker, who was
drafted by the Giants in 1998 but was released in training camp.
``It's something you can't control. I feel I've done pretty well
for myself. I hope I've done enough. I'm just going to go out and
do the best I can do and let them decide on who they want to
keep.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookies and free agents are usually guys who dot the bubble
list. But occasionally a veteran player finds himself fighting for
a roster spot on the last day of the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   That could be the case for three three-year veteran safeties _
Omar Stoutmire, Kenny Wheaton and Singor Mobley. With neither
threatening for a starting spot, the Cowboys will be hard pressed
to keep all three, considering they could use one of the salary
spots to finance a practice squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be naive to the fact,'' Wheaton said. ``It
could very easily happen. I can't worry about it. I just have to go
out there and play. If it doesn't work out and I would love for it
to work out here, I have enough confidence in myself I can play
somewhere in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   It all could come down to how they play Thursday night.
\Nsubheds:Last chance to shine
</P>
<P>
   Roster spots are on the line Thursday against the Jaguars for
several Cowboys players, including:
</P>
<P>
   Receivers: Jason Tucker, MarTay Jenkins
</P>
<P>
   Running backs: Beau Morgan, Denvis Manns
</P>
<P>
   Fullbacks: Ryan Neufield, David McCann, Robert Thomas
</P>
<P>
   Tight end: Brian Waters
</P>
<P>
   Offensive linemen: Oliver Ross, Ben Fricke, Freddie Childress
</P>
<P>
   Safeties: Omar Stoutmire, Kenny Wheaton, Singor Mobley
</P>
<P>
   Cornerbacks: Marvin Love, Zebbie Lethridge
</P>
<P>
   Linebackers: Myron Smith, Joe Phipps, Robert Thomas
</P>
<P>
   Defensive linemen: Robert Newkirk, Brandon Noble, Darren Benson,
Chance McCarty
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is being evaluated at fullback and linebacker

TRYING TO SORT THE TRUTH FROM THE MESSAGES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Go ahead, believe what they say. Who knows, it might even be the
truth. Sometimes it does work out that way, but other times ...
</P>
<P>
   Sorting through a variety of mostly jock-world voice messages, I
came up with this:
</P>
<P>
   Deion Sanders: Never mind the usual down-talking arrogance,
Nine-Toed was at his me-me-me best when pontificating for the
Channel 11 camera last weekend. Don't even think, Deion revealed,
about him playing cornerback until he could also return punts.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Cowboys have a severe shortage of bodies and
experience at the corners. But punt returns provide more
opportunity for personal glory than do passes rarely thrown in
Deion's direction. ``Toe-gate'' continues at Valley Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Police chief Darrell Fant: Nobody would want to be walking, or
driving, his Highland Park beat this week. The media frenzy has
been ``overwhelming'' since Jerry Jones tried to make it to the
church on time.
</P>
<P>
   But what about that police department quote that Jones was
``definitely agitated'' in his dealings with the officers?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched \Rthe video\S several times and it appears he was
mostly frustrated at the situation about being late,'' Fant said
yesterday. ``I didn't sense Mr. Jones was being abusive to the
officers in any way. The Joneses are a great family. Nothing like
this has ever come up before.''
</P>
<P>
   Fant also wanted to stress that he totally stands behind the
officers involved in the Jones case, but that dealing with the
media madness has been rather shocking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like we keep saying, there was no slow-speed chase involved at
all, but most of the media continues to ignore that,'' Fant added.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, his department is under media siege to release, yes,
the mug shot taken of Jones when he was booked into the jail.
``Everybody has a hundred pictures of Mr. Jones, but I suppose this
one would provide a shock element,'' Fant said.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome, Chief Fant, to the world of Cowboys coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Oates: Last week in Arlington, the suggestion that Mike
Morgan be yanked from the rotation produced a perturbed Oates
answer of ``media conspiracy'' against Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   This week in Detroit, Oates let it be known he was looking for a
pitcher to replace Morgan in the rotation. It must have become a
``managerial conspiracy'' after Morgan was bombed again, this time
by the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Morgan: An amazing first half of the season success story,
who now has an empty tank. You did well, old-timer, but September
is no place for sentimental gestures by the manager.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Bradshaw: Come again, Terry. What's this you say about
Chan Gailey's offense being ``boring?'' Actually, Gailey gives us a
thrill-show compared to the Norv-Ernie offense that helped win
three Super Bowls. Both are supposed to be run-first, although
Gailey seems to stray from that at times, as did Ernie Zampese.
</P>
<P>
   But Gailey's offense provides many more opportunities for
down-field theatrics. It's only boring if it doesn't work, not in
concept.
</P>
<P>
   School presidents at TCU and SMU: This is your last chance to
explain those initial comments of ``knowing nothing about'' future
membership in Conference USA.
</P>
<P>
   Mack Brown: Two days before the North Carolina State game, the
Texas coach said, ``Darrell \RRoyal\S came by the office this week
and told me I had really screwed up. I asked why. He told me to
never schedule a team in the home opener that can beat you.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Oates, Part II: Not so quick there, Johnny, on your
public endorsement of Pudge Rodriquez for American League MVP. Two
weeks later, and (personal opinion), Rafael Palmeiro will win it.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Bradley: The NBA big man guru, Pete Newell, said it: ``I
made a comment that \RBradley\S looked to me like he needed a good
conditioning program, and he said, ``You know what, I read that,
and you're exactly right.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Shawn, did it really take six years in the league for you to
figure that out?
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Franchione: The whole truth and nothing but the truth,
came from TCU's own. ``I don't think this is the ideal time to be
playing them,'' reasoned Coach Fran. He meant, of course, the
Sunday night visit by Arizona after last week's blasting at Penn
State.
</P>
<P>
   Believe what you want, but I think you can trust in that last
one.

TWO QBS BETTER THAN ONE AT ARIZONA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Playing two quarterbacks _ and keeping both happy _ is easy. All
you've got to do is win.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's tandem quarterbacks _ senior Keith Smith and junior
Ortege Jenkins _ shared time and led the team to a 12-1 record last
season, including a Holiday Bowl victory against Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact we were winning made it easier,'' Arizona coach Dick
Tomey said. ``If you lose, nobody is happy.''
</P>
<P>
   An unhappy bunch of Wildcats will come to Fort Worth to play TCU
Sunday night. And even though Arizona opened the season with a 41-7
loss at Penn State in last Saturday's Pigskin Classic, Tomey has no
intention of altering his two-headed quarterback creation.
</P>
<P>
   When Arizona takes the field against the Horned Frogs, Smith is
expected to start and play at least the first quarter, with Jenkins
playing the second quarter. Who plays the second half is determined
by first-half performances.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback competition or controversy can rip a team apart. At
Arizona, it brought the team together.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Smith started as a redshirt freshman and passed for
1,450 yards and 11 touchdowns. As a sophomore, he suffered a
shoulder injury and Jenkins, a redshirt freshman, took over and
passed for 1,669 yards.
</P>
<P>
   That led to a tense situation going into spring practice in
1998. Smith believed Jenkins would start; Jenkins believed Smith
would start. There were rumors that both would transfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them both that if they wanted to transfer to transfer
right then so we could move on,'' Tomey said. ``I challenged them
both. I told them they'd both get an equal chance to win the job.''
</P>
<P>
   However, before last season's opener against Hawaii, Tomey knew
he had a dead heat. Neither had played well enough for the coaching
staff to designate one as the starter and the other a reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a quarterback system. We just have two
exceptional people who both deserve a chance to play,'' Tomey said.
``The fact they've handled it so well has been part of the
chemistry of our team, the unselfishness of our team. Obviously,
they would both love to play every snap.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sat down last season and decided they wouldn't let it be
a distraction or problem for the team. They deserve all the credit.
It's the two of them that decided they would make this work.''
</P>
<P>
   Making it work wasn't much of a problem. Smith and Jenkins have
been friends since the day Jenkins arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got here, Keith took me under his wing,'' Jenkins said.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterbacks were united by what they had in common. Both
are Californians and both are proficient in sports other than
football. Smith was drafted by the Detroit Tigers and played one
season in the minor leagues as a shortstop. Jenkins came to Arizona
hoping to play football and basketball; he played 13 games for the
Wildcats basketball team in 1997-98, but has given up hoops.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Jenkins are road roommates. They have a ritual of
watching an in-room, pay-per-view movie the night before games.
They prefer action flicks such as ``The Rock'' and ``Con-Air,'' but
they might watch the ``The Buddy System'' if it was available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of football, we hang out together,'' Smith said.
``We're similar in a lot of ways. He just dresses better than me;
I'm kind of a slob. I enjoy being his roommate on the road. He's
one of the funniest guys I've ever met. He's an all-around good
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins said the two share so well because of mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some doubts in my mind when I first heard we were going
to do this,'' Jenkins said. ``But I knew how good he was and how
good I was. When you've got confidence in the next guy going in
there, the bottom line is you want to win. If I had been the
quarterback all year and we had gone 8-4 or 7-5, I would have
turned that in for the record we had last year in a second.
Whatever guy doing the best is the guy who needs to be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins made the play of the 1998 season when he somersaulted
into the end zone over three Washington defenders to give the
Wildcats a 31-28 victory. After the game, though, Jenkins gave
credit to Smith for a key completion during the winning drive. And
last Saturday against Penn State, when Smith suffered a sprained
ankle in the second half, Jenkins was one of the players who helped
Smith hobble to the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes it work so well is our relationship,'' Jenkins
said. ``We have a great friendship. We both can help this team win.
When you're winning, nothing can go wrong.''

HARDLUCK QB RICK MIRER HOPING FOR LAST LAUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Rick Mirer is with his fourth football team in
four years, and you could have expected to find the hardluck
quarterback dazed and confused at his new digs with the New York
Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer, however, has borne the travails of his travels
exceedingly well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I don't recognize myself in the mirror. I've worn so
many different jerseys,'' Mirer said, bemused.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, maybe this is the place where Rick Mirer gets the last
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Jets' playbook in hand, blue eyes bright and a smile on his
face, the 28-year-old Mirer stood at his locker Wednesday and gave
up no clues that he, in some circles, has been viewed as one of the
NFL's poster children for serious underachievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about what people say,'' Mirer said, undaunted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair. It's not right. I think my peers understand
where I was and the circumstances, especially in Seattle after my
first year, or in Chicago, which was somehow even worse. Guys in
the league say, `You had no chance.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the former Notre Dame sensation may have landed in
a good spot to turn things around.
</P>
<P>
   After being drafted by the Seahawks in 1993, getting traded to
the bad news Bears in '97 and then signing with Green Bay on Sept.
2, 1998, Mirer has been plucked to AFC Championship land by Jets
top Tuna, Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday night, when the Jets play the Vikings in their
preseason finale, Mirer will have had a chance to show Parcells
whether or not he is a worthy back-up for Vinny Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   Like Testaverde, whose career was on the scrap heap, Parcells
has told Mirer that his career can turn around in a hurry, if he
can do what Parcells asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anything about Rick that concerns me,'' Parcells
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells scouted Mirer back in '93, when the Patriots wound up
taking Drew Bledsoe as the No. 1 pick and Mirer fell to the
Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's in the past, and I don't care. I've seen
good things from him. I like his feet. He's bright. And to tell the
truth, I'm a little surprised by his arm strength,'' Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than I thought. So I'm glad he's here. And I'm
sure there's a lot of other teams that would like to have a guy
like this right now, from what I've seen out there.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when Mirer, as a music-loving 20-something who
scouted Seattle clubs and hung out with Pearl Jam, really was a
good fit for the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   But during his waning tenure there, the snake-bitten Mirer
seemed so prone to snap misjudgments and disastrous happy feet, you
wondered how he ever emerged from Notre Dame so highly regarded.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer hopes his troubles are behind him. He said he does not
want to blame anyone but would have performed better had Tom Flores
remained as coach instead of Dennis Erickson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt better with Tom Flores than Dennis Erickson. Just
the style. My first year wasn't a make-or-break season. That's
probably the only season I've had that was like that. Every other
one, the coach is on the hot seat,'' Mirer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot to learn when I came into the league. I'd be the
first one to say that. I didn't come from a school where we dropped
back and threw the ball 40 times a game. I needed that coaching,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Trust also became a factor, when Erickson dumped the struggling
Mirer in favor of John Friesz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the situation with Brett (Favre in Green Bay). They
stuck with him and that was pretty ugly. But the coach wasn't
caving into what people were saying and things turned out all
right, and he wound up with three MVPs,'' Mirer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that would have happened to me, but I firmly
believe you have to give your guy confidence so he can take
chances, make a mistake or two and he's not coming out of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking across the country to Seattle, Mirer said he is a little
envious. Jon Kitna, another young, mobile quarterback, has the
chance to learn under Mike Holmgren, with a lot of talented players
around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in a good spot. He's in a spot where he can excel. Not
everybody gets that, so I hope he knows what he's got, because Mike
Holmgren is going to get it done,'' Mirer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks and Jets do meet again this season, although not until
the finale on Jan. 2 at the Meadowlands. No one is predicting
whether Mirer will be with the Jets then, although you can't help
but wish him the best of luck.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, how can you not appreciate a good-natured, nomadic,
seven-year pro who, when asked whether he is renting or buying a
home now that he is on Long Island with the Jets, Mirer posted a
huge grin and said, emphatically:
</P>
<P>
   ``Renting.''
</P>
<P>
   He's got the right attitude. Here's hoping he can win the job.

LINEUP'S RELIABLES DELIVER FOR METS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Mets have uncovered heroics from some rather
unglamorous spots this season. Steely infield defense and the best
bullpen in the league may delight a manager, but it isn't exactly
the stuff of big-type headlines and video retrospectives.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, the Mets went old school. One night after they
struggled to score and lost to the Houston Astros' ace Jose Lima,
the Mets got exactly what they needed: eight extra-base hits and
plenty of offense in the final game of their road trip from exactly
the hitters they would expect. John Olerud, Mike Piazza and Robin
Ventura, the 3-4-5 hitters in the order, took a game into their
hands, not with dramatic last at-bat home runs but with a series of
well-placed and perfectly timed hits that led the Mets to a 9-5
victory over Houston in New York's last appearance in the
Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura slugged his 200th career home run as part of a three-hit
night with four runs batted in, which gives him 108 r.b.i. for the
season. Piazza added four hits and Olerud had three hits and scored
three runs as the Mets remained three and a half behind the Atlanta
Braves, who beat the Reds, in the East Division race. Cincinnati
fell four games behind the Mets in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   This trip was all about learning how the Mets fare against
potential playoff opponents. Here's one positive indicator: They
have played the Astros six times in 10 days and won four, and they
split six games with two teams that are almost certain to make the
playoffs. Wednesday, they did it with an offense so effective that
they left 15 runners on base and Manager Bobby Valentine could
laugh it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Credit the offense for having them on base,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   After two thrilling games in this series _ one that the Mets won
with the long ball and one in which they were victimized by a grand
slam _ this game was marked more by the twin struggles of the
starting pitchers and the hitters who abused them.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Octavio Dotel, the rookie who has been alternately
masterly and dreadful for New York, nor Chris Holt of Houston could
locate his pitches early in the game. That made for a walk-laden,
frequent-hit start.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scored first, when Ventura, hitting just .222 on this
trip and in danger of slipping below .300, smacked a two-run home
run to right field, his 29th.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets could have had more, but they stranded Roger Cedeno at
third and Rey Ordonez at first when Holt, in his best piece of
pitching in the game, caught Rickey Henderson looking at a pitch
and then got Edgardo Alfonzo to swing for strike three.
</P>
<P>
   Dotel has made just 13 major league starts and his inexperience
has shown, seemingly, in alternate appearances.
</P>
<P>
   In his last one, at Arizona, he held the Diamondbacks to one run
on four hits in eight innings. But that only meant he was due for
an off game. In the second inning, Dotel walked Stan Javier, who
stole second base and, when Piazza's throw went into center field,
advanced to third. He scored on Paul Bako's groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Dotel easily retired the side in the third, allowed two more
runs in the fourth when Jeff Bagwell homered and Javier drove in
Ken Caminiti, but then retired the side again in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the sixth did Dotel lose the curveball he relies upon.
He gave up singles to Bagwell and Caminiti and walked Derek Bell to
load the bases. He left and Pat Mahomes came on in fantastic
relief, allowing only a fly ball that scored Bagwell and pitching
two perfect innings of relief before giving way to Dennis Cook and
Armando Benitez. In five-plus innings, Dotel (6-1) had allowed five
hits and four runs, not as impressive as some starts, but good
enough for a victory , and enough for Valentine to say that he was
sure Dotel would remain in the rotation, even after Rick Reed is
likely to be activated Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got an offense like that behind me, you feel
comfortable,'' Dotel said. ``I feel like when it's my game to
pitch, I'm going to win because of what I have behind me. I just
have to make good pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory came hours after Bobby Bonilla rejoined the Mets.
Bonilla, who has not played in the majors since the first week of
July, was 3 for 13 (.231) as a designated hitter at Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a rash of injuries _ and his strained relationship
with Manager Bobby Valentine _ Bonilla has appeared in just 45
games this season and has hit just .159. But upon his return, he
said he would do whatever was asked of him. That may not be much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see him starting,'' Valentine said. ``I can't foresee
a future where he might play.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder DARRYL HAMILTON left the game in the third inning
after he strained a left patella tendon while running hard to first
base. It is much like the injury that has plagued him all season.
... RICK REED, making his second rehabilitation start, allowed one
hit _ a home run _ and one walk while striking out five in five
innings for Class AA Binghamton. ... Among the Mets' Sept. 1
call-ups were JORGE TOCA, the minor league player of the year who
will provide depth at first base, and JAY PAYTON, the oft-injured
outfielder who has been sidelined with a strained muscle in the
abdomen. In 49 games with Norfolk, Toca hit .335 with 25 runs
scored and 29 r.b.i. Payton, in 38 games, hit .389 with 27 runs, 35
r.b.i. and eight home runs. He will most likely play in the
outfield and be a pinch-runner.  &QL;

MEXICAN WOLF PUP DIES OF PARVO; OTHERS FEARED AFFLICTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal wildlife officials scrambled Wednesday to prevent the
spread of a fatal virus that killed one endangered Mexican gray
wolf pup last week and might have killed two more pups on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials considered the situation critical since there are only
about 210 of this wolf subspecies in existance, including 22 in the
wild.
</P>
<P>
   All three dead pups were part of the Pipestem pack, a group of
eight wolves that are being recaptured after the July 11 killing of
a calf in the Apache National Forest. That was the first killing of
domestic cattle since wolves were reintroduced to the wilds of the
Southwest in January 1998, nearly three decades after they were
exterminated.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the 4-month-old pubs died Aug. 24 while in a
holding pen south of Alpine. Analysis at a federal animal
laboratory in Wisconsin showed Wednesday that it died of
parvovirus, a highly contagious and deadly disease that can infect
domestic and wild canines.
</P>
<P>
   Adult wolves released into the 5-million-acre Mexican gray wolf
recovery area during the past two years have all been vaccinated
against parvo.
</P>
<P>
   But the five pups born to the Pipestem pack were born in the
wild and never inoculated, said Vickie Fox, spokeswoman for the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``They contracted it somewhere in the wild,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   The two other pups were found dead on Monday at the Sevilleta
National Wildlife Refuge in central New Mexico, which currently
holds about 20 wolves. Officials there immediately began
inoculating other pups, isolating the pack and disposing of food,
feces and any other material that could harbor the disease, Fox
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough virus,'' she said, adding that it can survive
dormant under snow for up to six months and still be infectious.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife officials captured the Pipestem pack's lead male, a
yearling and five pups, including the three who died. They still
are trying to capture the pack's lead female. &QL;

NEW GUYS PITCH IN FOR RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-ROYALS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In case you missed it, the Red Sox are no longer the
same team that limped home last week after series in Texas and
Minnesota. As if by magic, they have become a dangerous ball club,
aggressive and well balanced. They can beat you in a dozen ways.
</P>
<P>
   At first it seemed as though timely hitting and strong starting
pitching would carry the Olde Towne Team to its sixth straight
victory. Instead, the Red Sox called upon stingy defense and a bona
fide closer to preserve a 4-3 victory over the Kansas City Royals
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night. A crowd of 31,743 at Fenway Park went home
cheering the offense that produced a 4-0 lead, starter Kent Mercker
(1-0), and reliever Rod Beck, a breath of fresh air and confidence
missing since the loss of Tom Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   The 1-2-3 ninth inning by Beck was actually frosting on the cake
for a team that has won six straight games and eight of its last
nine. But Fenway fans are very astute. With Beck around they know
the Red Sox can look forward to some torrid finishes in the final
month-plus of the season. Playing for the wild card no longer has
to be the goal. Suddenly, there are bigger fish to fry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really appreciate the crowd,'' said Beck, who arrived for
work Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night following a flight from Los Angeles after
being acquired from the Cubs Tuesday. ``It made me feel good. I'm
happy to be here. It's a great situation for myself. Being back in
a race means a lot to me. You always want to play in games that
mean something.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night's game started like it was just another stroll
around the nearby Fenway gardens. The Royals seemed perfectly
content to absorb their third straight loss and seventh in eight
games against the Red Sox this season. Boston scored single runs in
the first and third innings and two more in the fourth. Mercker
allowed only two hits and no runs through six innings.
</P>
<P>
   The most exciting activity seemed to be scoreboard watching.
However, wild-card competition Oakland beat the Yankees, 7-1,
keeping Boston's lead at two games.
</P>
<P>
   The game grew interesting with a three-run rally by Kansas City
in the seventh. Mercker lost his touch and walked two of the three
batters he faced. The third reached base on a fielder's choice and
throwing error by Mercker. Rheal Cormier relieved and gave up a
single to Jed Hansen that scored a run. An error by Jeff Frye,
subbing for Jose Offerman, on a double play attempt resulted in two
more runs. After a sacrifice bunt, the Royals had the tying and
go-ahead runs on second and third. A walk to Jermaine Dye loaded
the bases, and Cormier was removed in favor of John Wasdin.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sweeney then hit a rocket toward left, but rookie third
baseman Wilton Veras, making his first start since being recalled
from Double A Trenton, made a sensational leaping catch to end the
inning. Wasdin breezed through the eighth, and Beck did his thing
in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we have to get ready for tomorrow,'' said Red Sox
manager Jimy Williams, ``but I think I'll savor this one a little
bit. I thought we got good pitching out there from everybody. Beck
did a nice job. Why was he there? To me he was the right guy to put
in there even though he traveled across country. Mercker did a good
job with his fastball, changing speeds. He was really pitching out
there to help us win. I know I went out to see him in the seventh
after the first walk. But I still felt he could get them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Offerman and Nomar Garciaparra teamed up for the first two
Boston runs. Offerman was hit by a pitch to lead off the first and
scored on a single by Darren Lewis and a ground out. In the third,
Offerman reached on a single to right and scored on a Garciaparra
single to right. But Offerman left after six with a bruised
forearm.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a big factor in winning that game, but we had Frye
available and I didn't hesitate to put him in,'' said Williams.
``As for Jose, we'll have to see how he is tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   For Beck, this was a night he won't soon forget. ``I've never
been to Boston. I've never been to Fenway,'' he said. ``I planned
on coming here for the All-Star Game, but I blew out my elbow, so
that didn't work out. But I get to see it after all. I'm pretty
excited about being in the (pennant) race again. That's usually
when I do my best work. We were pretty much biding time in Chicago,
not having a whole lot of fun. I'm looking forward to having fun
here.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Accompanied by the 78-year-old woman who worked more than a
decade to overturn his rape conviction, Vincent Jenkins walked out
of prison Wednesday, 17 years older and two surgeries frailer than
when he walked in.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, a lawyer from Manhattan named Eleanor Jackson Piel,
used DNA evidence to persuade a federal judge in Buffalo to order
her client's release.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a beautiful thing,'' said Jenkins, who sat between Ms.
Piel and his other lawyer, Barry Scheck, at a news conference
Wednesday night. ``It's like walking into a whole new world.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins has no immediate plans. He cannot work, he said, because
he had part of his lung removed when he learned he had lung cancer
in prison; he also had a hip replaced. For now, he is going to live
with his sister in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to tell how I feel,'' he said, ``because your heart
is like your toe. It grows skin on it and it gets hard. ``But,'' he
added, ``people like Mrs. Piel soften it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Piel and Jenkins have had a long relationship. She defended
him in a manslaughter case in the 1970s, and though Jenkins was
convicted, she continues to defend him, saying that he stabbed the
victim in self-defense. Ms. Piel was not Jenkins' trial lawyer in
the rape case, but he wrote to her following his conviction in
1983, asking if she would handle his appeal. She agreed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, after discovering that there was still physical
evidence from the rape trial, she contacted Scheck, who is
co-director, with Peter Neufeld, of the Innocence Project at the
Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in Manhattan. Jenkins is the 65th
person in North America to be freed by DNA evidence, Scheck said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jenkins was ordered released on Monday, the judge in
the case, John T. Elfvin, has not announced his reasons. He has
promised to issue a written opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins was living in Buffalo in May 1982 when a young woman was
raped in a nature conservancy there. More than four months after
the rape, Jenkins was picked up by police in Buffalo who, his
lawyers said, convinced the victim to identify him as the rapist
despite her initial response that he was not the one. He was
convicted and sentenced to 20 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the DNA evidence that would free him two decades
later, Ms. Piel said, the conviction was surprising in that Jenkins
was five inches shorter and several years younger than the
attacker.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Piel said the first of two DNA tests was conducted in 1993,
after she was joined in the case by Scheck. But that test was
inconclusive, and she said there was not much progress in the case
for several years.
</P>
<P>
   A second, more refined test was conducted in April by Edward T.
Blake, a criminologist who runs a lab in Richmond, Cal., Forensic
Science Associates. The test showed that Jenkins' DNA did not match
the attacker's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, great,'' Blake said, when he learned Wednesday that
Jenkins had been released. He praised Ms. Piel: ``She's someone
who's been there, done that and is still fighting the good fight,''
he said.

WHAT AT RELIEF! BECK ON HAND 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-BECK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ First came the commute to work. A six-hour flight from
Los Angeles. A 45-minute cab ride from the airport. It was Rod
Beck's first day on the job, but there was no time for orientation.
The newest Red Sox reliever arrived during the early innings of
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night's game against the Kansas City Royals and took his
place in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   He took the field at 9:39 p.m., in the ninth inning, and was
greeted with a standing ovation as he headed to the mound. The
noise grew even louder when his name blared over the public address
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, I'm Jason,'' said Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek, as the
two shook hands before Beck warmed up. ``What do ya got?''
</P>
<P>
   He had virtually unhittable stuff. Beck needed just 11 pitches
to carry out his first-day assignment. He retired Scott Pose on two
pitches, a fly out to center fielder Damon Buford. He retired
Johnny Damon on a ground out.
</P>
<P>
   Beck put Jeremy Giambi in a 0-2 hole before throwing three
consecutive balls, the second in the dirt. Then he struck out
Giambi swinging to seal a 4-3 Red Sox victory and collect his first
save in a Boston uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at the end of the work day, Beck introduced himself to the
rest of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went pretty darn good. I just have to keep it going,'' said
Beck, whose arrival Wenesday &UR;  &LR; night marked his first visit to New
England. Acquired from Chicago Tuesday, he will be counted on to
bolster a bullpen that has seen much change since closer Tom Gordon
went down with an elbow injury.
</P>
<P>
   Beck, a Los Angeles resident, got up Wednesday at 7 a.m. to
catch a 9 a.m. flight, during which he mostly slept. He arrived in
Boston at 6 p.m. and caught a cab for the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Beck was dropped off in front of Fenway with his luggage, not
knowing where to go next. Officials directed him to the clubhouse,
but by then the game had started.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got here late, around the second or third inning, and I got
in the bullpen around the fifth. I didn't have a chance to talk to
anybody about how I was going to be used,'' said Beck. ``They just
said they were down to a four-man bullpen, so get out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been to Boston. I've never been to Fenway. I
planned on coming here for the All-Star Game, but I blew out my
elbow, so that didn't work out. But I get to see it after all. I'm
pretty excited about being in the (pennant) race again. That's
usually when I do my best work.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck's first effort impressed manager Jimy Williams, who said he
spoke briefly with Beck when he arrived. ``To come in the game and
get three outs after traveling across the country . . .,'' said
Williams. ``He probably hadn't even met all those guys on the field
when he was pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck said he doesn't want to step on any toes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done pretty darn good without me all year,'' he said.
``Whatever they want me to do, I'll do, I'll be happy. I know what
I'm capable of doing. The only thing different is getting used to a
new uniform. I've pretty much done everything in this game except
win a ring. That's ultimately what we all play for.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had ever before faced any of the three batters he
retired Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night, Beck said, ``We played Kansas City in
interleague play, and Giambi, we see him in spring training in
Arizona. I would say I'm not going to know most of the guys, but at
the same time, they're not going to know me.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh, Rod, did you know that was Jeremy Giambi, brother of
Oakland's Jason Giambi?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I didn't,'' he said. ``I thought it was Jason. So I lied.
I didn't face him in spring training. But I threw to him like I
throw to his brother.''

GARCIA AT A LOSS OVER COMPROMISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Richie Garcia had a plane to catch. He just
didn't know where he was going.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa or Detroit? As Garcia perused the airline schedules, he
pondered the alternatives. The last flight to each city would be
leaving at 9:25 Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night, but the 25-year veteran American
League umpire figured there was a world of difference. If he went
to Detroit, he would be rejoining his crew and working Thursday
night's game, his job spared. If he wound up in Tampa, he would be
headed home to Clearwater, Fla., unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia discovered that the situation wasn't so clear-cut. At
7:26 in the courtroom of US District Judge J. Curtis Joyner, the
umpires' union won satisfaction with an asterisk. According to a
compromise forged with Major League Baseball, 22 veterans whose
resignations were supposed to take effect at midnight Wednesday
will be allowed to keep their jobs, at full pay and with full
benefits, through Dec. 31, when the collective bargaining agreement
expires. But, per edict of baseball commissioner Bud Selig, they
will not be allowed back on the field for the remainder of the
season. Their places will be taken by the 25 minor leaguers MLB
promoted, effective Thursday, back on July 27. As part of the
settlement, the umpires' appeal for injunctive relief to the
National Labor Relations Board was dropped, and the matter will
proceed to arbitration. If the union is stymied there, its 22
members in limbo will be left at the mercy of new collective
bargaining, their futures in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   That's part of the fallout from the 68-member union's quixotic
attempt to assert its bargaining power by submitting mass
resignations July 14, only to see the ploy backfire 13 days later
when it attempted to rescind them and was informed that MLB had
arbitrarily accepted 22 and filled those positions.
</P>
<P>
   Now Garcia, 57, who has four children and four grandchildren,
still has a job, just no place to do it.
</P>
<P>
   He had feared as much some two hours before the ruling when he
emerged from an eighth-floor waiting room in James S. Byrne US
Courthouse, where he and four fellow umpires had been marking time
for almost eight hours while union attorneys continued protracted
negotiations with MLB that spanned some 16 hours over two days.
After checking the possible itineraries, Garcia headed back into
the stifling anteroom to continue the vigil with AL colleagues Mark
Johnson and Ed Hickox and union president Jerry Crawford and Eric
Gregg of the National League.
</P>
<P>
   ``This must be like the world's longest rain delay,'' he was
told.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's (expletive) worse,'' he muttered. ``It's the worst thing
I've ever been through.''
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal had begun six weeks ago in an airport hotel not 20
minutes from the courthouse here. Union general counsel Richie
Phillips had called a meeting of the membership the day after the
All-Star Game in Boston in an effort to forestall a one-day strike,
which would be illegal under the umpires' pact with MLB. That bid
was stifled. But Phillips still feared that the commissioner's
office was trying to consolidate authority over the umpires,
commandeering that power from the individual leagues, and that it
might try an unprecedented move to dismiss lowly rated umpires.
Sandy Alderson, the executive director for baseball operations in
the commissioner's office, had assured Crawford that was not MLB's
intention, but the rank and file remained unconvinced. So Phillips
suggested the alternative strategy _ mass resignations, effective
Sept. 2, as a show of solidarity and a preemptive measure against
MLB. It was approved unanimously, or so the union _ including
Garcia, the organization's vice president and perhaps the most
vocal propoent of the move _ thought.
</P>
<P>
   But within 48 hours, the campaign began to unravel. Umpires who
retained individual counsel were advised that their resignation
letters left them without recourse should baseball choose to accept
them. Defections began occurring in the form of letters of
rescision, and with union ranks sundered, the remaining umpires
tried unsuccessfully to void their letters, leading to MLB's
selective acceptance policy and ultimately to the doomsday
negotiations here.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his defiant public stand, Garcia was anxious when he
flew here from Detroit Monday night for the climactic
confrontation. ``I really didn't know what to expect after all
this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His hopes were buoyed during Tuesday's seven-hour session, which
had been conducted at Joyner's urging in lieu of a formal hearing.
An agreement seemingly had been reached: The 22 umpires could keep
their jobs and MLB would employ some or all of them as it saw fit
during the final month of the season and the playoffs. ``All it
needed was Bud Selig's signature,'' said Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   So confident was Garcia that he checked out of his downtown
hotel Wednesday morning. And when he arrived at the courthouse,
resplendent in an open-collared bright red shirt and black pants,
Garcia held out hope that he would be spending Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night in
his blue work clothes at Tiger Stadium. Instead, he discovered that
the negotiations had taken a devastating twist overnight. Instead
of approving the agreement, Selig decreed that the 22 veterans
could not return to duty this season; furthermore, he wanted them
removed from the staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, today it's no deal,'' said Garcia. ``We
didn't even have time to put it to a vote. They gave us 15 minutes,
take it or leave it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes became nine hours as attorneys for both sides
scurried back and forth from Joyner's fifth-floor chambers. After
one last round of caucuses, the compromise became official.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia sat grimly in the back of Court Room 8-B as the decision
was announced. And after Joyner adjourned the hearing, the umpires'
de facto spokesman stood and shook his head as he assessed the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'm not going to work but I'm going to get paid,'' said
Garcia, his voice brimming with sarcasm. ``It's a situation where
Major League Baseball has decided that instead of having 345 years
of experience on the field during the most important part of the
season, it would rather have us go home. Now if that makes sense to
you . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips stepped in and held court, condemning Selig's action as
``absolutely shameful'' and ``punitive.'' Meanwhile, the remaining
four umpires _ minus Gregg, who had headed home _ slipped out of
the room and headed down the corridor to a water cooler at the far
end, where they huddled for some five minutes. As they dispersed,
they embraced and Garcia told Crawford, ``We did the best we
could.''
</P>
<P>
   But he clearly felt that wasn't good enough. The union
entourage, headed by lead attorney Susan Davis, swept up Garcia and
swarmed into a waiting elevator. Garcia put his arm around Davis
and said as the doors closed, ``Just because I'm pissed doesn't
mean I'm pissed at you. We're not done yet, we're not done yet,
we're not done yet . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   And with that, he was off, racing to catch the last plane to
Tampa. Ultimate destination unknown.

DODGERS' LOSS IS UMPS' FINALE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Dodgers' and Milwaukee Brewers' seasons have
ended _ players, coaches and management resigned themselves to that
fact eons ago.
</P>
<P>
   Another group had their seasons, and possibly their careers, end
with the culmination of the Dodgers' 5-4 loss to the Brewers on
Wednesday at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball and the umpires' union agreed to settle
their dispute, and in the wake the resignations of 22 umpires were
accepted. Among those 22 were three-fourths of the crew that worked
this game. Terry Tata, Tom Hallion and Bill Hohn each find
themselves out of work today. The fourth, Ron Kulpa, remains a
working umpire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love baseball, but right now I hate baseball,'' said
Hallion, a 14-year major league veteran. ``You know it's the last
game. I had it on automatic pilot out there. My head was so far out
of that game because of everything I was thinking out there.''
</P>
<P>
   During an emotional post-game press conference laced with anger
and venom and a touch of shock, Hohn and Hallion voiced extreme
displeasure with what's transpired. Hohn also said he believes the
American League umpires credited (or discredited, depending on the
view) with breaking the umpires' union's plan are the real
culprits, and not union head Richie Phillips, who orchestrated the
mass resignation the day following the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Those 24 AL umpires are blamed with breaking the solidarity of
the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart's broken. I'll tell you that right now,'' Hohn said.
``I am really, really upset with the American League umpires and
what they did to my family. I have a 13-year-old daughter and
2-year-old son.''
</P>
<P>
   The umpiring crew didn't know the details of the agreement
before taking the field, but Hohn and Hallion said they were aware
of the basic structure of the agreement and realized it would, in
all likelihood, be their last game.
</P>
<P>
   According to the agreement, the 22 umpires will be paid through
December and receive benefits. They could get their jobs back
through an arbitrator, but a decision on that is months away.
</P>
<P>
   The umpires' union said they'll drop their court fight and
unfair labor practice. They also said they won't strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't these baseball people have any heart?,'' Hohn said. ``I
mean, we all have families. They're ruining families, and that's
what hurts. We don't bother anybody off the field, we don't bother
anybody on the field. We're just doing our jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between baseball management and the umpires has
been tenuous for the last few years. It reached a crescendo earlier
this season when Hallion was suspended for three days by National
League president Leonard Coleman for bumping a player.
</P>
<P>
   But the just-concluded three-game series between the Dodgers and
Brewers went off with little incident between umpires and players
or coaches. The only questionable moment came in the top of the
ninth Wednesday when Brian Banks was called out by Tata for running
outside of the baseline on a tapper in front of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Among many of the Dodgers, there was remorse about what was
happening with the umpires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's ridiculous,'' Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley said.
``I think it's bad leadership to lead them down a dead-end road.
They got led down a dead-end road. I get along with all of them and
I respect them. They really wanted to get something done. The
owners are being hard line, big-time, with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue was a little closer for Milwaukee because of the role
of baseball commissioner Bud Selig. The former owner of the Brewers
turned control over to his daughter, Wendy Selig-Prieb, and has
been a harsh critic of the umpires.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a kind of consensus here that some of the umpires have
been sticking it to us because of Bud Selig,'' said Brewers third
baseman and Providence High graduate Jeff Cirillo, who chose his
words carefully. ``I haven't seen it.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Baseball's sorriest drama of 1999 won't star Kevin
Costner as an aging pitcher battling power hitters and the power of
love.
</P>
<P>
   Even if ``For Love of the Game'' is a washout on par with
``Waterworld,'' baseball will have done it one worse. Just ask the
middling crowd that wandered into Dodger Stadium on Wednesday to
see a baseball game and saw a movie unfurl. Introducing scenes from
``The Beware Richie Project,'' starring Richie Phillips. It's a
comedy of errors that would be funny if not for all the people
hurt.

Since June of 1985 I've been proud to serve Major League Baseball,
proud to be an arbiter of the Boys of Summer. ``My name is Tom

   MOVE IN ON REPORTER NEAR DODGERS DUGOUT, DELIVERING A LIVE
STAND-UP:
</P>
<P>
   ``POX News has just learned that Major League Baseball and the
umpires' union have reached a deal after two days of intense
negotiations. It's Weeping Wednesday for 22 umpires whose
resignations were accepted last month by the American and National
leagues. They will be unemployed as of 6 a.m. after their pleas for
reinstatement fell on the deaf ears of a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The umpires' union withdrew its lawsuit in return for full pay
and benefits the remainder of the year for the deserted 22 and a
$1.36 million postseason bonus payment that amounts to roughly
$20,000 for each of the league's umpires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides decided the arbitration route is the way to go to
put an end to this tumultuous journey. It will be November,
probably, before the first rulings are handed down. Now, back to
the studio. ''

BASE UMPIRE HALLION, TERRY TATA (HOME PLATE), RON KULPA (FIRST
BASE) AND BILL HOHN (THIRD BASE) ARE AWAITING THE EXCHANGE OF
LINEUP CARDS BETWEEN THE DODGERS AND MILWAUKEE BREWERS. TIGHT SHOT
OF THE FOUR MEN.
</P>
<P>
   Hallion: ``OK, I know this is gonna be hard, but we're
professionals and we've got a job to do. If this is indeed Terry's
last game after 40 seasons, let's make sure we send him out
right.''
</P>
<P>
   THE OTHERS, TOO EMOTIONAL TO SPEAK, NOD THEIR HEADS AND SCUFF AT
THE DIRT WITH THEIR SHOES. CUT TO TWO FANS SITTING SIDE-BY-SIDE IN
THE BLEACHERS IN THE SECOND DECK, ON THE THIRD BASE SIDE. ONE IS
EYEING THE UMPIRES THROUGH BINOCULARS. HE TURNS TO THE OTHER AND
SPEAKS:
</P>
<P>
   ``Three of those dudes are gone after this game. Hallion, Tata,
Hohn; Man, I'd be bitter if I were them. Richie Phillips, he's
their union head, he's supposed to have their backs, right? And
what does he do? He sells them out for chump change from the
postseason bounty and the tin hope some arbitrator will rule the 22
have to be rehired.''
</P>
<P>
   Fan 2: ``It's a major bummer. If I were them, I'd be really
peeved at the 24 American League umpires who caved before Phillips'
strategy even had a chance to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know, the umpires on the whole have no one to blame
but themselves. They're the ones who followed Phillips like
sacrificial lambs to slaughter when he advised them in July to
tender their resignations as bait to lure commissioner Bud Selig to
the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe not a single one of the 68 was smart enough to
see they could end up killing their careers long before their
collective bargaining agreement expires at the end of December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I hope they use their free time to read ``An Idiot's
Guide to Negotiating.'' If the book doesn't already exist, they can
write it. They certainly know now what not to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Fan 1: ``Yeah, I've seen a lot of the umpires quoted as saying
they thought Phillips was just posturing, that he wasn't really
going to follow through on the plan. And then, when the majority of
the umps rescinded their letters of resignation eight days later,
they seriously expected baseball to forget the whole thing? Get
real!
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to try that: Go into my boss at H&AMP;R Block in
mid-February and say, `I resign, effective on April 1,' so he'll
sweeten my situation.''

GALAXY EARNS SHARE OF FIRST

<P>
   PASADENA _ While others missed easy chances Wednesday night, Roy
Myers made the most of his, scoring twice to lead the Galaxy to a
3-1 victory over San Jose _ moving Los Angeles to the top of the
Western Conference standings for the first time this season in
front of 8,662 at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The three-point victory moved the Galaxy (16-9, 42 points) into
a first-place tie with Colorado (16-8, 42 points), though the
Rapids have a game in hand. Still, for a team that trailed Colorado
by 12 points earlier in the season, it's been a rewarding chase
back to the top _ at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been something we've fought long and hard for,'' said
Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid of the tie with the Rapids. ``Our emphasis
going into the game is that we wanted to show a Galaxy that could
play with some heart, spirit and play intelligently. I thought we
did all three tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles had a chance to share the Western Conference lead
Saturday, but their 1-0 loss to Dallas snapped a four-game winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   `We can lose a game occasionally, but we're not going to lose
more than one in a row,'' said Schmid. ``That's what we've been
talking about. We're going to bounce back from losses and take care
of business the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers, who had a bad performance against the Burn over the
weekend, gave Los Angeles a 2-0 lead, working a give and go with
Carlos Hermosillo. Actually, Hermosillo's first touch from Myers
skidded away to the right side, but San Jose goalkeeper Joe Cannon
came out to challenge. That left Myers open in front of the net.
Hermosillo simply crossed it back in front and Myers finished with
the inside of his left foot to an open net in the 58th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles saw its lead cut in half a minute later.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose's Alejandro Sequeira took a long pass from defender
John Doyle and barely beat L.A.'s offside trap, finding himself
one-on-one with Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin Hartman. Sequeira beat
Hartman to the near post, cutting the Galaxy's lead to 2-1 in the
59th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Defender Greg Vanney finished San Jose in the 71st minute. San
Jose defender Wade Barrett tripped up Clint Mathis, setting up a
penalty kick, which Vanney delivered to the near post.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely effective on set plays, the Galaxy took the lead in the
second minute, starting on a Vanney corner kick and finishing with
Myers' one-touch strike.
</P>
<P>
   Vanney's cross was tipped away to the right side by Cannon. Cobi
Jones gathered it and sent a delicate chip toward the penalty spot
for Danny Pena. Pena headed the ball back to the top of the penalty
area for Myers, whose one-touch to the far post ricocheted and
bounced in for the early goal.
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo missed the best opportunity to give the Galaxy a
two-goal lead in the 28th minute. The Mexican striker chested down
a nice cross from Jones 5 yards in front of San Jose's goal. And
with only Cannon to beat, Hermosillo blew an easy finish, chunking
his left-footed shot straight to the Clash keeper.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose's best opportunity came earlier in the match. Dario
Brose sent a corner to the far post for John Doyle. Doyle's header
looked like it would beat Hartman to the near post, but Hartman got
a finger on it to knock it away.

SPARKS ENTER UNCERTAIN OFFSEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Sparks cleared their lockers and autographed a bunch of
items at the Forum Wednesday before saying their good-byes for
about eight months.
</P>
<P>
   They departed in relatively good spirits after completing their
best season ever, far exceeding many preseason predictions by
finishing the third WNBA season one victory short of the
championship series.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks were 20-12 in the regular-season, finishing with the
second-best mark in the league, went 2-2 in their first playoff
appearance, and forced the two-time defending champion Houston
Comets to three games in the Western Conference finals before
ending their year.
</P>
<P>
   They were the only team to win more than one game against the
Comets. They split with them during the season, and opened the
conference finals with their third win over Houston. But the Comets
won the last two games to move onto their third championship
series.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks are gone, but several questions regarding the team
remain to be answered during the off-season. For instance, will the
Buss family retain ownership of the team or will the league take
over because of lagging attendance? Will Orlando Wooldridge's
contract be renewed? Will the Sparks play in the Forum or the
Staples Center next season? How many players will the Sparks be
able to retain in the expansion draft? Will Buss hire a new general
manager or continue assuming the responsibilities?
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks, who averaged 7,625 in attendance, are among a few
teams (Utah and Charlotte are the others) to be reviewed by the
league in the off-season to decide whether to take over ownership
or grant contract extensions. The Busses have until Sept. 30 to
make a case for keeping the Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Buss and his father, Laker owner Jerry Buss, would like
to retain the team. But Johnny Buss said he would like the league
to be more lenient when it comes to sponsorship, broadcasting
rights, and marketing concepts. The league and Buss have had a
contentious relationship from the very beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make some adjustments,'' he said. ``I think they
are ready and willing to talk now. They wanted to go by the books
and that was great. They have for three years. Now I think it's
time for a little ease of restrictions, at least for Los Angeles,
but hopefully for the rest of the league.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Sparks will most likely remain at the Forum in 2000,
because the Democratic Convention cuts right into their season, but
will join their fellow NBA counterpart, Lakers, into the Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   As for Woolridge, he will enter negotiations with the Busses
after the business with the league is resolved. Woolridge was the
Sparks' third head coach and the first to finish a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to get this situation taken care of as soon as
possible,'' said Woolridge, who came in third for Coach of the
Year. ``It is my feeling and my understanding that they want me to
coach this basketball team.''
</P>
<P>
   The league will also decide in the off-season how many players a
team can protect for next year's expansion draft. Buss would like
to protect six, but said the league is leaning toward five. For the
time being, he is inclined to remain general manager until he finds
a suitable candidate.
</P>
<P>
   SPARKS NOTES: Center Lisa Leslie was fined $500 for shoving
Houston's Tina Thompson in the final game of the Western Conference
series Monday. Thompson was dealt a $300 for taunting Leslie.

DISNEY'S THEME PARK DESIGN GROUP GETTING NEW QUARTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Walt Disney Co. announced plans on Wednesday for
an ambitious makeover of its Imagineering theme-park design
operations, transforming dozens of concrete tilt-up buildings into
a 125-acre, college-style campus in west Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment giant, which has operated Imagineering in a
nondescript industrial park since 1961, will build a series of
four- to six-story buildings. The Grand Central Creative Campus, or
GC3, will be surrounded by green belts, parkways, courtyards,
walkways, tree-lined streets and planted medians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campus would be a state-of-the-art workplace that is
simple and elegant,'' said Ed Chuchla, Imagineering's director of
development. ``There would be green corridors running all the way
through it and we'd no longer have huge megablocks of nothing but
buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney executives gave no projection how much the project will
cost or how many new jobs it will create. They said the basic idea
will be to generate creativity and job satisfaction among the 3,000
employees who design theme parks, Disney's most consistent profit
generator.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, which projects the first new building could be available
for occupancy in 2004, wants to eliminate Grand Central Avenue and
Circle Seven Drive. But as part of an acknowledgment of the
property's history, Disney will restore the Grand Central Terminal
building, erected eight decades ago when the property operated as
an airport.
</P>
<P>
   Disney executives will take the first formal step this fall by
asking the city of Glendale, nine miles north of the downtown L.A.,
to conduct an environmental impact study. The 125 acres lie within
the city's San Fernando Road Redevelopment Corridor, which includes
DreamWorks' animation campus and Disney's future KABC-TV (Channel
7) studios.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Armstrong, Glendale's director of development, said the
proposal should help bring jobs and improve the corridor, a
two-mile sliver of land to the east of the Golden State Freeway.
``It's exactly what we were hoping for,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   But Disney won't make Imagineering's revamped home into a
tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still going to operate in a very low-key manner because
much of what we do here is proprietary,'' said Doug Moreland,
Imagineering's vice president of development. ``What we're changing
is the overall aesthetic quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney bought the property _ northeast of the intersection of
Interstate 5 and the Ventura Freeway _ from Prudential Real Estate
Investors in 1997. It occupies about 60 percent of the buildings
with remaining tenants including machine shops and offices.

SALE OF ANGELS, DUCKS REPORTEDLY NEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walt Disney Co. officials declined comment Wednesday on reports
the organization has a deal to sell the Angels and Mighty Ducks to
Orange County-based billionaire Henry T. Nicholas III for $650
million.
</P>
<P>
   According to published reports, Disney has ``completed the
parameters of a deal'' to sell the baseball and hockey clubs to
Nicholas. The report, by baseball analyst Peter Gammons, was
written for Disney-owned ESPN.com, but corporate officials were
silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're declining comment on all speculation about the Angels
and the Ducks,'' said Disney spokesperson Christine Castro.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Disney-ESPN link, Castro responded: ``We don't get
involved with the operations of our communications division.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadcom officials also refused to disclose the nature of their
talks with Disney.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not commenting on that _ at least at this point,'' said
Broadcom corporate spokesperson Bill Blanning.
</P>
<P>
   The $650 million price tag for both teams might be a bit steep.
Industry analysts have valued the Angels-Ducks package at $375
million to $425 million, but Nicholas ``stepped up and closed the
deal,'' Gammons wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Any deal would need the approval of Major League Baseball.
Disney has not yet sought permission from the commissioner's office
to share financial information with Nicholas.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Disney signed an agreement with then-owner Gene
Autry to pay $140 million for the Angels. Autry died last year. The
company also spent $100-120 million to renovate Edison
International Field and paid a $50 million franchise fee to the
National Hockey League for the Mighty Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Disney investors, both teams have been money
losers.
</P>
<P>
   The potential sale of the teams comes on the heels of a Disney
sell-off. Last week, the corporation sold Fairchild Publications
for a reported $650 million. Analysts have said Disney's recent
sell-off efforts have been an attempt to cut costs and boost
dropping stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels entered the season with a payroll of $53 million, a
franchise record. The team, which is 51-81, is on pace for its
worst season ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Mighty Ducks have never made it beyond the second round of
the NHL playoffs. This year, they were swept by Detroit in the
first round.

RADIO BROADCASTER ENLARGING RELIGIOUS NICHE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JEREMY BAGGOTT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMARILLO, Calif. _ Marquee radio shows like ``Focus on the
Family,'' ``Grace to You'' and ``Insight for Living'' have powered
its stations into prominence.
</P>
<P>
   As a network, its syndicated political programs, like ``The
Michael Medved Show,'' ``Janet Parshall's America'' and ``The Cal
Thomas Commentary'' are picked up by more than 1,400 stations
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, officials at Salem Communications Corp., based in Camarillo
northwest of Los Angeles, think the company still has a lot of
growth in it, despite already being the nation's eighth-largest
radio broadcasting company. And thanks to Salem's initial public
offering in July, Wall Street analysts appear to be on the same
wavelength.
</P>
<P>
   While its market niche may be Christian, when it comes to the
bare-knuckle business of radio, there is little ethereal about the
way Salem harnesses the ether.
</P>
<P>
   Of its 46 stations, 34 broadcast in 19 of the nation's top
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Salem also operates Salem Radio Network, a national radio
network offering syndicated talk, news and music programming to
about 1,450 affiliated radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   But at its core, Salem is in the business of owning and
operating radio stations. Brothers-in-law Edward Atsinger III, the
president and chief executive officer, and Chairman Stuart Epperson
_ both of whom had been involved with radio since the '60s _ saw an
opportunity in the '70s to build a franchise within the religious
broadcasting niche.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IPO does position us for this type of growth,'' said Eric
Halvorson, chief operating officer of Salem Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will allow us to enter top markets we're not in now. In
some cases, it will allow us to buy second and third stations in
markets we are already in to provide complementary programming,''
said Halvorson. ``I wouldn't be surprised to see our number of
stations go north of 50 by year's end.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what makes Salem unique: Its focus on America's
metropolitan markets instead of the rural heartland where religious
broadcasting has traditionally found its audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The large-city locations Salem operates in have typically been
underserved by religious broadcasting,'' said Brandt Gustavson,
president of the Manassas, Va.-based trade group National Religious
Broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of their 50,000 watt, clear-channel `superstations' like
WMCA in New York and WHK in Cleveland cover enormous populations.
Also, the quality and background of their management is top-drawer.
When they come into these major markets, they know what it's all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   With the proceeds from the $140 million IPO, Salem has already
announced it will acquire Atlanta's WNIV-AM and WLTA-AM from
Genesis Communications for $8 million. Atlanta is the 12th-largest
media market in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Salem has also acquired the operations of KCBQ-AM in San Diego,
the nation's 16th-largest market, and holds an option to purchase
the station from the Concord Media Group for $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of the stations gives Salem a presence in two more
top-25 markets. Salem's stations in the Los Angeles region are
KIVE-AM (870), KLTX-AM (1390) and KKLA-FM (99.5), all in Los
Angeles; and KDAR-FM (98.3), covering Ventura and Santa Barbara
counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're also in the process of buying two radio stations in
Louisville, Ky.,'' said Halvorson, ``and (we have) four
acquisitions pending in Honolulu with anticipated fourth-quarter
closings.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the three analysts tracking Salem, Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown
gives Salem shares a ``buy'' recommendation; ING Barings, a
``strong buy''; and Salomon Smith Barney, an ``outperform.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding momentum, Salem announced last month an exclusive
agreement with Internet firm RealNetworks to offer family-oriented
radio broadcasting on the Net through Salem's Greensboro,
N.C.-based Internet portal OnePlace.
</P>
<P>
   The deal makes OnePlace the exclusive branded provider of
Christian radio broadcasting for RealNetworks' RealPlayer spiritual
``presets.''
</P>
<P>
   A preset is the Internet radio equivalent of a button on a car
radio that automatically takes the listener to a preselected
station.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will click on the spiritual preset,'' said Halvorson,
``and be directed to three of our radio stations, a (separate)
teen-age-oriented format with Christian lyrics, a talk radio
selection and another station that plays solely Christian music,''
which, says Halvorson, is the fastest-growing music segment in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Salem's aggressive growth, Wall Street seems
unimpressed. Shares of Salem, which trade on Nasdaq under the SALM
ticker symbol, have fluctuated between a high of $29.9375 and
$21.375 since it closed at $25.50 on its first day. Salem closed
Wednesday up $1 at $28.50 on light trading.
</P>
<P>
   Salem stock may be weighted down by its aggressive growth.
</P>
<P>
   In its first quarterly report since going public, the company
said last month that it lost $3.5 million in the second quarter
ended June 30, with $2.6 million of it due to a one-time charge for
a stock grant associated with Salem's initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterly loss, which amounted to 21 cents per share,
compared with a net loss of $785,000, or 5 cents per share, for the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue climbed to $22.7 million from $18.7 million due to
increased revenue from properties Salem acquired and growth at
existing stations.

INFLUENTIAL IOC MEMBER'S SON INDICTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the second criminal charge to emerge from the Salt Lake City
Olympics bribery scandal, the son of one of the most influential
members of the International Olympic Committee was indicted
Wednesday on federal charges that he fraudulently obtained U.S.
residency and then lied about it to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say that Kim Jung Hoon , the son of Kim
Un-Yong, a power broker in the world of international sports,
illegally received a green card and then used it to enter the
country numerous times.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a Utah businessman admitted helping the younger Kim,
who goes by the name John Kim, obtain residency by providing a
bogus job at his company. The businessman, David E. Simmons, a
former chairman of Keystone Communications, told a federal court on
Aug. 3 that he set up the job with his Salt Lake City-based company
as a way of influencing Kim's father, a South Korean national who
sits on the Olympic committee's executive board.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's indictment, John Kim was charged with accepting
$104,000 as part of the no-show job at Keystone. Investigators say
the company was reimbursed by the Salt Lake City bid committee.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have charged the committee with using an
elaborate gift-giving scheme to court IOC members who would vote on
the site of the 2002 Winter Games. Salt Lake City, which made its
first Olympic bid in 1966, was awarded the Games in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Since December, an investigation by the Justice Department and
other federal agencies has examined allegations that Salt Lake
City's committee spent up to $3 million on expensive gifts like
jewelry, tuition payments, overseas junkets and cash.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal has led to the expulsion or resignation of 10
members of the IOC and undermined the committee's credibility. In
the past, Kim Un-Yong denied any involvement in the scandal, but
the IOC nevertheless issued him a severe warning and said he could
still be expelled if he was found to have knowledge of his son's
business dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Florman, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said
she could not comment on whether Kim Un-Yong was being
investigated. ``We will, however, go wherever the facts and
evidence lead,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kim's lawyer, Howard Graff, denied the allegations, saying
they were based on the accusations of Simmons, which he called
``inconsistent, illogical and untenable.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Schechter, a spokesman for the Kim family, said that Kim's
employment with Keystone was legitimate. He added that Kim, who is
now visiting South Korea, was told by the Salt Lake City committee
that if he had any trouble obtaining his green card, Sen. Orrin G.
Hatch of Utah would provide help. In a statement Wednesday, Hatch
denied promising to intervene on Kim's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Schechter said that Kim, who lives on Long Island, was visiting
South Korea and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pound, a Canadian who is a member of the IOC's executive
board, said he was disturbed by news of the charges, although he
said he did not know the details of the indictment. ``It sounds
serious,'' he said. ``This is the first charge that has a direct
connection to the IOC We'll be looking at it closely.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal with Keystone, Kim was placed on the
company's payroll between October 1990 and March 1992 and was paid
$50,000 a year, which later increased to $70,383, according to the
indictment. The Salt Lake City committee later reimbursed the
company through phony consulting contracts and $10,000 from Kim
himself. Kim was granted legal residency by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service in September 1992.

 EXTRA-SMART LAB MICE RAISE HOPES FOR BRAINIER PEOPLE  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Genetic manipulations targeting a single protein in the brain
have produced a strain of extra-smart laboratory mice, scientists
reported Wednesday, suggesting it may someday be possible to boost
human memory in much the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Princeton University said they have engineered a
strain of mice with abundant amounts of a memory-enhancing
substance called NR2B in their brains.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments show that the mutant mice, nicknamed ``Doogie''
after the brainy title character in the ``Doogie Howser, M.D.'' TV
series, have much better long-term memory and learning ability than
ordinary mice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does raise some specific options for the pharmacologic
treatment of memory disturbances in humans,'' said Dr. Marsel
Mesulam, a neurologist and director of Northwestern University's
Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer's Disease Center in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, he added, experimental results point to ``a
serious possibility that we could have memory-enhancing drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, medical and legal experts raised a slew of
questions about the potential dangers of brain-enhancing drugs
based on genetic alterations, emphasizing that it will take many
years of research before any human uses might be attempted.
</P>
<P>
   The NR2B protein is incorporated into a larger molecule known as
the NMDA receptor, a gatekeeper that sits on the membrane of nerve
cells, controlling the flow of charged particles that determine
when nerves fire.
</P>
<P>
   Nerve cells with receptors built mostly with NR2B are more
active than other receptors in the same family. As a result, cells
with the overactive receptors seem to be more likely to form
connections with other neurons.
</P>
<P>
   Identifying NR2B as a ``molecular switch in the memory
process,'' the authors conclude, ``has indicated a potential new
target for the treatment of learning and memory disorders. This
study also reveals a promising strategy for the creation of other
genetically modified mammals with enhanced intelligence and
memory.''
</P>
<P>
   However, hyperactive brain machinery also may increase the risk
of serious side effects, notably stroke and epilepsy. And while
mice and people have much the same basic neurochemistry, the links
between particular genes and higher-order brain functions in people
are still very much a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long way from mice to men,'' said Stanford University
law professor Hank Greely, co-director of a Stanford program on the
ethical dimensions of genetic research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adding extra copies of a gene to improve mouse memory may work
in mice, but it may not work in people, or it may have adverse
effects in mice that don't show up in these experiments, or it may
have more adverse effects in people,'' he added. ``It will be a
long time before we understand how genes and memory are related in
humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts said it came as no great shock to discover that genes
and proteins are involved in important brain functions, just as
genes help determine physical traits.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the latest results the first time a transgenic mouse
mice  &LR; has been produced that shows a hint of extra brainpower.
</P>
<P>
   But experts credited the Princeton research team, led by
molecular biologist Joe Z. Tsien, for producing by far the most
convincing evidence that the NMDA receptor is the key player in a
so-called ``unifying mechanism'' of learning.
</P>
<P>
   Test-tube results strongly suggested that the structure and
activity of the NMDA receptor might be driving the learning
process. That led to an elaborate series of memory and learning
tests in the mice to see how the gene-altered receptors affected
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Results of experiments involving recognition of novel objects,
among several other tests, left little doubt that the ``Doogie''
mice, which otherwise seemed normal, had superior intellects, the
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   The study caps several decades of scientific detective work
aimed at revealing the core dynamics of a brain at work _ and how
medicine might tackle problems not easily treated through
conventional approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The genetic alterations, performed on the ``Doogie'' mice in the
womb, was aimed at producing extra quantities of what is formally
known as the ``NMDA receptor 2B'' subunit.
</P>
<P>
   This NR2B subunit protein is normally found in large quantities
only in younger brains. As animals reach adulthood, a less active
subunit comes to dominate, which the scientists said could explain
why children often learn more readily than adults.
</P>
<P>
   Greely, the Stanford law expert, said it would be a mistake to
rush to judgment about the practical value of the early-stage
experiments in mice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there are things that improve intellectual performance
in humans already,'' he said, ``like getting enough food to eat and
education and so on. It's important not to overly focus on the sexy
issue of the day. Both genetics and environment play a role in
almost everything we do, and I suspect memory ultimately will turn
out to be not very different.''

Woofer Jordan and Tweeter Reilly. At this rate, Brown is going to
lock up the sympathy vote.
</P>
<P>
   Next time, to even the battle, Brown should bring along his tiny
clone, Mini Mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The debate committee made mistakes, of course. Somebody forgot
to bring the foam bats for Reilly and Jordan to use on the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Credit goes to Willie's mustache, making a plucky comeback from
a brutal shaving. Advice to Brown on 'stash: Don't leave home
without it.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Brown was interrupted by a heckler, and it turned
out to be Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   Did I go out for popcorn and miss the parts where Jordan and
Reilly attacked one another?
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, it was a lively debate, with some real issues raised
and discussed, some real emotion shown. Of course, in political
debate, the evaluation bar is set lower than the bar at a cockroach
limbo contest.
</P>
<P>
   Wake me when they get to the talent competition: Jordan dancing
the shower scene from ``Flashdance,'' Reilly speed-writing a
48-page book on how he'll fix the Giants' bullpen, &LR;  and Willie
tap-dancing.
</P>
<P>
   The Brown-Jordan-Reilly debate winner: You mean after all that
babbling, posturing, pontificating and cliche-spouting, someone
actually wins?
</P>
<P>
   WHAT PART of mandatory summer school does the Oakland Board of
Education not understand?
</P>
<P>
   And what do they now tell the 7,000 kids who went to summer
school after being told they had to attend in order to be promoted?
Can these gullible children get a refund on their summer?
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Oakland, state schools Superintendent Delaine
Eastin said, ``That is a district in deep, deep yogurt.''
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't heard that expression, but assume it's worse than being
in deep clover but better than being in deep doo-doo.
</P>
<P>
   THE GOOD fathers at St. Boniface in the Tenderloin blessed the
taxis Wednesday, and I hope the program proves successful and is
expanded to Muni Metro, which might require a full-scale exorcism.
</P>
<P>
   And what about a blessing of the taxi passengers, where each cab
will stop at the curb in front of St. Boniface and the padre will
place a Dramamine tablet on the tongue of each rider?
</P>
<P>
   A San Francisco cab trip is the Bay Area's most gut-wrenching
thrill ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do 2 of every 3 cabbies here drive like they're trying to
make you sick?'' wonders visitor James Smith.
</P>
<P>
   It's a San Francisco tradition, James. To pass taxi driver
training school here, you have to place a Caesar salad in the back
seat of your cab and toss it without touching it.
</P>
<P>
   SAY IT AIN'T SO: Beanie Babies will be retired at the end of
this year, the company just informed consumers, whose panic is
expected to plunge the world into massive economic (and spiritual)
depression.
</P>
<P>
   My financial advisor  &LR; adviser tells me that the Beanie Baby news
could open the door for a gigantic pet rock revival.
</P>
<P>
   REDNECKS ain't what they used to be. Nichole Bradshaw was
driving down 101 Wednesday and saw a pickup truck with a gun rack
in the rear window. And in the gun rack? Rolled-up blueprints.
</P>
<P>
   A CRUISE SHIP and a tanker collided recently, and Walt
Sledzieski is amazed that this kind of accident doesn't happen
regularly, especially right here in the bay. Walt notes a recent
Chronicle ``Ship Traffic'' report that listed one ship's port of
origin as ``unknown'' and three other ships' destinations as
``unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   If these guys don't know where they're coming from or where
they're going, little wonder there are collisions.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, most of the captains are men, which means they won't
stop to ask directions.
</P>
<P>
   IT TURNS OUT that the scientists who claimed they cloned Dolly
the sheep were pulling the wool over our eyes. We fell for it, and
don't we feel sheepish.
</P>
<P>
   A DNA analysis proved that Dolly isn't a true clone, but what is
known as a chimera. Kind of a c &LR; Clone- &LR;  l &LR; Lite.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it crazy? DNA testing nails Dolly, while O.J. walks the
streets a free man.
</P>
<P>
   Dolly and her chimera, in homage to fraudulent duos everywhere,
will henceforth be known as Wooli Vanooli.

WNBA FOCUSES ON YOUNGER PLAYERS, BUT VETERANS HAVE BEEN KEY FOR
FINALISTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before Game 3 of the WNBA's Eastern Conference final, New York
center Kym Hampton needed one more shot to relieve the pain, one
more shot to play another day.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-inflammatory injection into her swollen 36-year-old
right knee did the trick as she scored eight points and had 11
rebounds in the Liberty's 69-54 victory against Charlotte. With the
victory, New York (18-14) advanced to the best-of-three WNBA Finals
against Houston (26-6), beginning tonight at 7 in New York's
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact the WNBA might promote its younger players such
as Chamique Holdsclaw and Rebecca Lobo, it's the league's older
players who have carried the Comets and Liberty to the finals. For
those older players who look at the opportunity to play in the
United States as an open layup. Playing in the finals is like
making the title-winning jumper as time runs out.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, who averages 9.2 points and 5.6 rebounds, recently
announced that she is retiring at the conclusion of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just never thought that my career would have lasted so
long,'' Hampton said. ``It's nice to postpone retirement. Now, I
need to get my nails done. Don't you think I need a ring on this
finger?''
</P>
<P>
   Along with teammates Teresa Weatherspoon (33), Sue Wicks (32),
Venus Lacey (32) and Carolyn Jones-Young (30), who is on the team's
injured list, the Liberty appears to be a team closer to playing on
shuffleboards than on backboards.
</P>
<P>
   Proving that age doesn't matter, the quartet combines to average
25.1 points, 17.1 rebounds and 8.6 assists. In the Eastern
Conference finals victory against the Sting, Weatherspoon wore down
her younger counterpart, Dawn Staley, limiting her to 2-of-9
shooting and passing for 11 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Before the season, 36-year-old Cynthia Cooper said she was
concerned that maybe she was too old and wouldn't be able to play
up to her status as defending two-time Most Valuable Player. She
need not have worried. Cooper led the league in scoring for a third
consecutive season. Perhaps all she needed for inspiration was to
realize where she was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, I was playing in Italy and thought that would
be where I would retire,'' Cooper said. ``To play in the great
arenas all across this nation _ Madison Square Garden, the Forum,
America West _ it's an emotion that's really hard to describe. And
not one moment do we take it for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by Cooper, the Comets have five players at least 30 years
old _ Cooper, Tammy Jackson (37), Monica Lamb (35), Polina Tzekova
(31) and Janeth Arcain (30) _ who combine to average 40.9 points
and 16 rebounds and 7.7 assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten or 12 years ago, the opportunity to play in America hadn't
presented itself,'' said Jackson, who played overseas for 13
seasons. ``I am really grateful the WNBA has arrived and the
country has accepted it and supported it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hampton, ``I never play with it \Rretirement\S over my
head. Let the chips fall where they may because if you worry about
this being your last game, then you are worried about things you
should not even worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   She just wants to keep shooting.

NASCAR FANS HAVE THEIR BOOING PRIORITIES ALL MIXED UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the NASCAR Winston Cup Series rolls into Darlington, S.C.,
for the most revered of its summer holiday weekends, ]one would
have thought that Dale Earnhardt had shot the President.
</P>
<P>
   With their voices and via e-mail, NASCAR fans have registered a
resounding thumbs down for Earnhardt and the bump pass that sent
race-leader Terry Labonte spinning and ``The Intimidator'' into
Victory Lane at Bristol (Tenn.) Motor Speedway on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   And what was that strange sound raining down on Earnhardt as he
exited his black-and-banged Chevy?
</P>
<P>
   Boos? For the sport's second seven-time Winston Cup champion?
For the driver who typically receives more cheers during pre-race
introductions than any Cup driver, and more than Miss Winston? Boos
for the anti-Jeff Gordon? For doing precisely what has made
``Ironhead'' the richest driver in motorsports history _ and in the
eyes of many _ its prototypical competitor?
</P>
<P>
   ``The race fans are critics, and everyone has their opinion of
what they saw last week,'' Earnhardt said in his ongoing defense.
``It happened. I wasn't trying to wreck Terry. I hate that it
happened, but it did.''
</P>
<P>
   Two issues stick out in the aftermath of Earnhardt vs. Labonte:
</P>
<P>
   What do NASCAR's brand-loyal fans really want from Earnhardt, or
any driver, in the sport's premier division? Do fans want the
``boulevard racing'' that superspeedway mogul Bruton Smith so
detests, or do fans want the type of racing that has made NASCAR
the runaway success that it is today?
</P>
<P>
   And, can any NASCAR official define what constitutes a
proper/improper bump pass?
</P>
<P>
   That certainly was not the case Saturday night, when Jerry
Nadeau got penalized two laps for rapping Dale Jarrett in the rear
end _ long before Earnhardt launched Labonte into the spin cycle.
Why was Nadeau nabbed and Earnhardt let off? The appearance is that
Earnhardt, as Labonte and several drivers suggested postrace,
received preferential treatment equal to his stature.
</P>
<P>
   That also could be the interpretation when the case of Rudd vs.
Allison is reviewed. Ricky Rudd was involved in a similar last-lap
incident with Davey Allison at Sears Point (Calif.) Raceway in
1991. NASCAR accused Rudd of spinning Allison out of the lead as
the two headed to the white flag. Rudd was penalized 15 seconds,
and finished second.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling then was it was every man for himself on the final
lap,'' said Rudd, who finished third Saturday in a battered Ford.
``NASCAR said that wasn't the way it was. I didn't agree then, but
I took what they said and moved on. Maybe it's changed since then.
I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the veiled threats of retaliation mumbled by Labonte after
the race, NASCAR senior vice president Mike Helton needs to address
that issue before they drop the green flag and the chicken wings at
the Pepsi Southern 500 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As for the issue of booing Earnhardt, perhaps a quick review of
NASCAR's first 50 years is in order. The hoopla surrounding
NASCAR's golden anniversary in 1998 produced any number of top-10
lists, including 10 best races. ``Sports Illustrated's'' list was
typical, and it was topped by the 1976 Daytona 500. That race
featured a last-lap exchange of fenders between leader David
Pearson and arch-rival Richard Petty in the 31-degree Turn 4
banking, sending both cars careening into the concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson won the race only because he pushed in the clutch and
kept his Mercury running during the spin, allowing him to limp
across the finish line _ which Petty's stalled Dodge fell 50 feet
short of passing.
</P>
<P>
   It has been called the greatest race in NASCAR history, and both
drivers emerged as cult heroes and even respectful friends.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Earnhardt joined Labonte as only the second driver
with 600 career Cup starts at Watkins Glen (N.Y.) International
last month. They are proud members of the Class of 1979, with nine
championships between them. They know the written and unwritten
rules of NASCAR better than you or me or Helton, or anyone who
never has driven a Cup car. And they know the rules as well as
Jimmy Spencer and Bobby Hamilton and anyone currently driving a Cup
car.
</P>
<P>
   And so, on Saturday night, Labonte overtook Earnhardt for the
lead as the two took the white flag. The damning contact took place
as they barged through the 36-degree banking in Turn 2. Seconds
before, all of Earnhardt's loyal fans were on their feet _ begging
their hero to do whatever it took to win the race, just like he
used to in his glory days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was I not supposed to try to pass him back?'' Earnhardt asked,
incredulously.
</P>
<P>
   If he had not, then Dale Earnhardt should have been booed.
Spotlight On... Ray's crowing glory looms as perfect match for TMS
Armed with the Indy Racing League points lead, Greg Ray dialed up
Eddie Gossage at Texas Motor Speedway on Tuesday and got an earful
of advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him not to clinch it in Las Vegas,'' said Gossage,
referring to the penultimate round of the Pep Boys IRL season at
Las Vegas Motor Speedway on Sept. 26. ``I don't think he'll listen
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage, the executive vice president and general manager of
TMS, obviously has ulterior motives. He is banking on a points race
that has 13 drivers mathematically eligible to win the championship
to carry over into the season-ending Lone Star 500 at TMS on Oct.
17. Ray, who scored his third victory in the past four races at
Pikes Peak International Raceway on Sunday, leads Scott Goodyear by
44 points.
</P>
<P>
   Ray will win the Pep Boys Million as season champion if he
finishes third or better in each of the last two events.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities for Ray, on a personal and promotional level,
promise to keep Gossage and his staff hopping during the next
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking about this and wondering how many people
were there when the Cowboys won their first Super Bowl,'' Gossage
said. ``And it's still fresh in our minds about the Stars winning
the Stanley Cup, and Lance Armstrong winning the Tour de France.
We've got a unique opportunity here _ and maybe it's destiny _ that
the season finale for the IRL is in Greg Ray's back yard. I do
equate it to those kinds of monumental sports occasions in this
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, he's made an impression on us here, and you always
want the hometown guy to do well. Dale Earnhardt grew up in
Kannapolis /RNorth Carolina/S in the shadow of Charlotte Motor
Speedway. That's been a nice fit. Likewise, Greg Ray came along at
just the right time at Texas Motor Speedway. It's a mutually
beneficial relationship. What could be finer than for him to win
the race and his championship at his home track?''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Gossage said he has hired Jay Howard, who puts
together the annual NASCAR Winston Cup season-ending program at
Atlanta Motor Speedway in November, to handle the extravaganza in
north Fort Worth next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do something where the car and driver are in some
fashion put up on a stage and before the fans with fireworks going
off,'' Gossage said. ``We've even got a design with dancing water
fountains around the cars. We want to do something like that. We're
asking, `What can we do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ray has promised that he will not drive any differently during
the final two events. In fact, he admittedly feels uncomfortable as
favorite after struggling the first two seasons of his IRL career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not doing anything different than I did in January,'' said
Ray, who gave car-owner John Menard his league-record seventh
victory in the No. 2 Glidden-Menards Dallara/Aurora. ``I know who I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said that was not the case the first time Ray strolled
into his office for a visit one Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He introduced himself and proceeded to tell me what to do to
this racetrack,'' Gossage said. ``Here's a guy that had run
Toyota-Atlantic, had started racing in 1990 ... and I listened to
him and thanked him and kind of showed him the door. He's always
been this intense guy. People can mistake him for being cocky, but
the truth is, he's a supremely confident person. We've become good
friends and I really enjoy being around him. And I have seen
personally that he's toned down his intensity level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked about his intensity after Indy. I told him to relax
and it would come to him. He was forcing it too much and he's told
me he's becoming a smarter race car driver. He's done something
since Indy, and won some races.''
</P>
<P>
   QUICK HITS Crushed at Indy Pro Stock driver Bruce Allen of
Arlington is a two-time runner-up in the U.S. Nationals, the
National Hot Rod Association's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Pro Stock honor roll at Indianapolis Raceway Park in
Clermont, Ind., includes 10-time series champion Bob Glidden,
Ronnie Sox, Wayne Gapp, Don Nicholson and the late Lee Shepherd,
also of Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, who replaced Shepherd at Reher-Morrison Racing in 1985,
understandably has classified his second runner-up finish at IRP in
1986 as the biggest disappointment of his career. At that time, the
rivalry between Glidden's Ford Thunderbirds and Reher-Morrison's
Chevrolet Camaros was hot stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was racing Bob Glidden and I totally had him covered,'' said
Allen, driver of the Outlaw Fuel Additives Pontiac Firebird. ``I
got the jump at the starting line and I was outrunning him until my
engine exploded in high gear, and he drove right by me for the win.
It just crushed me.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was back in the days when Indy was the only race where
every single pro would compete. If you won Indy, you knew that you
were the best of the best. Plus, we got extra points for winning,
so it really meant a lot to win the race back then. It's still the
one race you want to win. I guess it always will be.''
</P>
<P>
   The event, which carries a $2.6-million purse, is scheduled to
begin today and conclude Monday. Jarrett tops ballot Dale Jarrett
dropped 101 points off his NASCAR Winston Cup points lead over Mark
Martin on Saturday night at Bristol (Tenn.) Raceway, where he
finished an uncharacteristic 38th.
</P>
<P>
   But Jarrett had a near-bulletproof run heading into Bristol,
which resulted in his selection as winner of the third-quarter vote
for Driver of the Year. Jarrett received 10 first-place votes and
four runner-ups from a panel of 15 motorsports journalists,
including this reporter, for a total of 114 points. Jarrett
outdistanced second-place finisher Juan Montoya, rookie star in the
Championship Auto Racing Teams FedEx Series.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya earned one first-place vote and 59 points. Third went to
NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series points-leader Greg Biffle, who earned
two first-place votes and 56 points. World of Outlaws star Mark
Kinser earned two first-place votes en route to tying CART's Dario
Franchitti for fourth with 36 points.
</P>
<P>
   Plano's Greg Ray, who scored two of his three Pep Boys Indy
Racing League victories during the quarter, earned one vote.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's Jeff Burton won the first quarter vote, and Montoya
prevailed during the second quarter. Two more rounds of voting
remain. Schumacher a slow healer Ferrari's Michael Schumacher
probably will miss at least the next two races on the Formula One
schedule because of persistent pain in the leg that was broken
during the British Grand Prix in July.
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher, a two-time World Driving Champion, made the decision
yesterday after his second practice drive since the crash, and
canceled plans to continue testing at Monza, Italy. He had planned
to return for the Italian Grand Prix on Sept. 12 on the same track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a test, and the problems in my leg are too big to do a
proper job,'' Schumacher said at a news conference. ``It is
basically impossible for me to run more than five laps at the
moment, and especially on this circuit.''
</P>
<P>
   The German said he would consult with his doctors Sunday.
Schumacher likely also will skip the European Grand Prix on Sept.
26. The final two races are in Malaysia on Oct. 17 and Japan on
Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher first returned to the cockpit on Aug. 20 at Mugello,
Italy, 40 days after breaking both bones in his lower right leg at
Silverstone, England. Last laps The management of Darlington
Raceway reportedly is ready to spend $3 million to add a lighting
system at NASCAR's oldest superspeedway, and run at least one of
its two Winston Cup races on the 1.366-mile oval at night.
</P>
<P>
   Roush Racing has released Johnny Benson from his contract as
driver of the No. 26 Cheerios Ford Taurus. Benson will complete the
season with the team, which does not have a primary sponsor for the
2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup veteran Ted Musgrave has been selected to replace
Butch Miller in the No. 40 Channellock Chevrolet Monte Carlo for
the Dura-Lube 200 at Darlington Raceway this weekend. Last words
``Who would have ever thought we'd need a race at Darlington,
especially the Southern 500, to calm everybody down?''

   Within two days, Texas A&AMP;M embarks on a season that could
include a fairy-tale journey from the No. 6 position to the top
spot in the college football rankings by the time all tortoises and
hares reach the finish line in January.
</P>
<P>
   That being the case, we offer this reminder about fairy tales.
Few come true. Some, with apologies to Aesop and Mother Goose,
unfold like this:
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, a maroon-clad football team awash in preseason
expectations opted to play its first game on the road against a
renowned gunslinger. And, lo, the strong-armed slinger they called
Steve Sarkisian surgically dissected an overmatched maroon
secondary, giving the home team a stunning upset.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to regroup, the maroon-clad warriors opted to visit a
small school in Louisiana, where the home team surely would serve
up a feel-good victory, as well as a side order of gumbo. But, lo,
the locals held firm and paddled the invading maroon marauders,
sending them tailspinning toward a .500 record.
</P>
<P>
   Any similarities between A&AMP;M's fairy-tale dreams of 1999 and its
nightmarish reality check in 1996 should be purely coincidental.
But we offer this sobering update, from a historical perspective:
The Aggies open their season Saturday night in Shreveport, La.,
against the nation's top gunslinger (Tim Rattay), who is the
quarterback for a small school in Louisiana (Louisiana Tech).
</P>
<P>
   Could this be a double whammy that threatens to undermine the
Aggies' run toward a national championship before they reach the
first turn on the track?
</P>
<P>
   In the words of Hugh Grant, who admittedly struggled with the
line during the filming of ``Mickey Blue Eyes'': ``Fuggitaboudit.''
</P>
<P>
   These Aggies, unlike their predecessors who belly-flopped
against Brigham Young and Southwestern Louisiana, should be able to
smirk their way through a double-digit triumph despite a hostile
crowd, a Rattay air show or _ worst of all _ a shortage of Tabasco
sauce for the pregame crawfish.
</P>
<P>
   In three years, A&AMP;M has gone from a young team in search of
playmakers to an experienced juggernaut, with 16 returning starters
and seniors dictating the on-field mood swings in most situations.
Coming off an 11-3 season and a Big 12 championship, these guys
won't panic in times of trouble, as the 1996 team did.
</P>
<P>
   Randy McCown and Sedrick Curry can testify to the
transformation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of guys on this team who won't let us have
another letdown like that,'' said McCown, a senior who suited up in
both of A&AMP;M's stunning losses to begin the 1996 season. ``I can see
the similarities \Rin early opponents\S. But we all know if we lose
to Louisiana Tech, there goes the national championship. We
shouldn't have any problem with a letdown like that this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor should the Aggies be vulnerable to an all-out air raid, as
they were against BYU in 1996. That day, Sarkisian shredded a young
secondary for 536 yards and six touchdowns while under little
duress from the A&AMP;M pass rush. Three years later, A&AMP;M is eight-deep
in quality defensive linemen and features what coach R.C. Slocum
considers his best secondary since NFL draftees Aaron Glenn, Ray
Mickens and Patrick Bates patrolled the deep zones in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about this game,'' said Curry, a third-year
starter at cornerback who was a well-scorched freshman at BYU in
1996. ``We know going in we're facing an all-out passing offense.
But that gives us more opportunities to make plays and get our
hands on the ball. We're comfortable and confident about what we
need to do. That comes with experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake. Rattay is the real deal. After throwing for 240
yards in last week's 41-7 loss at top-ranked Florida State,
Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden called Rattay ``the best passer I've
seen on this field'' in his 24 seasons in Tallahassee, Fla. Such a
list would include lots of luminaries.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these Aggies, unlike their predecessors, have the talent,
depth and ball-control abilities to survive a road date against an
aerial circus. By January, A&AMP;M's fairy-tale season may not come
true. But it should survive a trip to Louisiana.
\Nsubheds:SPOTLIGHT ON
Eric Gay Concern about using starters on special teams runs high at
Kansas State, where David Allen, the nation's leading punt returner
in 1998, has emerged as the starting tailback.
Longhorns' horror sets off a wave of paranoia
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, selected outtakes from season-opening losses by
Texas (three blocked punts) and Kansas (blocked field goal) have
made for required viewing throughout the Big 12 this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns surrendered 16 points on blocked punts in a 23-20
loss to North Carolina State. Kansas' blocked field goal swung the
third-quarter momentum toward Notre Dame, turning a potential
four-point game into a 48-13 runaway.
</P>
<P>
   To a man, rival Big 12 coaches said they are using the video
clips to remind their players of the importance of special teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, there's 300 paranoid coaches around the country
after watching what happened to Texas. Me, included,'' Colorado
coach Gary Barnett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want any team to have those kind of misfortunes,''
Oklahoma State coach Bob Simmons said. ``But it illustrates a point
and it's gotten our guys' attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the league, coaches are wrestling over the choice
between playing starters on special teams or reserving those roles
for backups. The toughest choice belongs to Kansas State coach Bill
Snyder, who has seen David Allen _ the nation's leading punt
returner _ emerge as his starting tailback.
</P>
<P>
   ``David made his mark at that position. He's close to some NCAA
records,'' said Snyder, who watched the former Fort Worth resident
average 22.12 yards per return, with four touchdowns, in 1998.
``But is it in our best interest for him to keep returning punts?
That's a difficult decision.''
\Nsubheds:QUICK HITS Safety shuffle Because of injuries, Texas
safety Lee Jackson will make his second career start at a second
position in Saturday's game against Stanford (11 a.m., Austin).
Jackson opened at strong safety in last week's 23-20 loss to North
Carolina State but was shifted to free safety in workouts this week
because of injuries to Quentin Jammer (shoulder) and Chris Butcher
(knee).
</P>
<P>
   Greg Brown, Jackson's backup, will start at strong safety. That
means the biggest adjustment this week falls on the shoulders of
Jackson, a sophomore, as the Longhorns prepare to face a team that
returns every significant player from a team that threw for 3,516
yards and 22 touchdowns last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be a little nervous, but I was nervous in the first game,
too,'' Jackson said. ``I just have to fill Jammer's shoes and
that's what I plan to do.''
\Nsubheds:Open auditions at A&AMP;M Texas A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum has yet
to settle on a replacement for inside linebacker Dat Nguyen, the
1998 Lombardi Award winner, in the Aggies' lineup. Playing time
distribution for four potential successors ``is still up in the
air,'' said Slocum, with two days remaining before the season
opener.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum said he probably will start senior Chad Frantzen against
Louisiana Tech, with significant playing time possible for freshman
Brian Gamble and sophomores Amon Simon and Harold Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's asserted himself, in my opinion,'' Slocum said.
\Nsubheds:Steele to script QB action Baylor coach Kevin Steele said
backup quarterback Odell James will see some action in Saturday's
opener at Boston College (11 a.m., ESPN), but it will not depend on
the performance of starter Jermaine Alfred.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll script it and have a specific place for Odell to go
in,'' said Steele, who reiterated his commitment to Alfred as the
starter. ``It'll be more a time-of-the-game thing than \Ra
situational substitution\S. If you put guys in just to run certain
plays, you can get things out of sync.''
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:BURCH'S PICKS Staff writer Jimmy Burch picks (against
the line) this week's Big 12 football games:
</P>
<P>
   Stanford (plus 11) at Texas. Pick: Texas. Longhorns rebound with
a vengeance while Cardinal players melt in Texas heat.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M at Louisiana Tech (plus 14 1/2). Pick: A&AMP;M. Aggies
control both lines, limit the air strikes of Tim Rattay.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor (plus 41/2) at Boston College. Pick: Baylor. A coin flip
says the Bears keep it close, if not pull an upset.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana-Lafayette (plus 34) at Oklahoma State. Pick: ULL.
Cowboys win handily but not by five touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama-Birmingham (plus 23) at Missouri. Pick: Missouri.
Tigers' turnaround is legitimate. An opening romp should prove
that.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado vs. Colorado State (plus 13). Pick: Colorado. Buffaloes
rule this series, should send statement in Gary Barnett's debut.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska at Iowa (plus 24). Pick: Nebraska. Rebuilding Hawkeyes
are no match for reloading Cornhuskers.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana State at Iowa State (no line). Pick: Iowa State.

</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech (plus 6 1/2) at Arizona State. Pick: Arizona State.

   OKLAHOMA Coach: Bob Stoops (first season).
</P>
<P>
   1998: 5-6 (3-5, T-4 in South Division.
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters: 5 on offense, 5 on defense (different
systems).
</P>
<P>
   What has to go right: Stoops and his staff have to get the most
out of the talent at hand, which is better than some in the Big 12
but not on a par with the best teams.
</P>
<P>
   What can't go wrong: Like most thin teams, injuries could prove
costly. Though this staff plans to play a lot of players on both
sides of the ball, it looks like Josh Heupel is the only
quarterback with a proper grasp of coordinator Mike Leach's
multiple, pass-oriented offense.
</P>
<P>
   Update: Heupel completed 17 of 29 passes for 222 yards and two
touchdowns in Saturday's major scrimmage in Tulsa. The scrimmage
before a crowd of 10,000-plus enabled OU to write a $38,000 check
to the American Red Cross for continued relief for the state's
tornado victims. ... OU had previously drawn 27,000 for a scrimmage
in Norman. ... The offensive line remains a big concern. Returning
starting guard Jason Bronson had to give up football because of
recurring concussions. Guard Ryan Allen missed all of last week
with a strained calf. And tackle Scott Kempenich is still having
problems with the foot in which he suffered a stress fracture last
spring, though Stoops hopes he'll be available for the Sept. 11
opener against Indiana State. Safety Ontei Jones, who tied for the
team lead last season with 100 tackles, likewise has not worked
much in August because he reinjured an ankle that kept him out of
spring drills.

ASTROS OUTFIELDERS SEEM CURSED IN HOUSE OF PAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Astrodome is doomed as a baseball venue, but the
Eighth Wonder of the World refuses to go quietly.
</P>
<P>
   As an act of vengeance against the last team that will abandon
it, the Dome seems to have placed a curse on the Houston Astros
outfielders. From the time Moises Alou fell off a treadmill before
spring training and ripped up his knee to Sunday, when Alou fell
off a bicycle and re-injured himself, the Astros have been
clobbered by a series of injuries to their outfielders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm in my second year of medical school,'' Astros
general manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``I never wanted to be a
doctor. I'm ready to resign my post.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou was just the start of troubles for the outfield. Since the
All-Star break, the Astros have lost Richard Hidalgo, Derek Bell,
Glenn Barker and Carl Everett to injuries that required time on the
disabled list. Hidalgo is done for the season after knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The situation reached an absurd point this week when the Astros
outfield consisted of three players _ veteran Bill Spiers and
rookies Daryle Ward and Lance Berkman _ who were once considered
infielders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pitching staff has saved us,'' second baseman Craig Biggio
said. ``If it wasn't for our pitching, we'd be in real trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching and the usual superb play and leadership of Biggio and
Jeff Bagwell have allowed the Astros to fend off _ for now _ the
surprising Cincinnati Reds in the National League Central. But it
has been a much tougher fight for a team that walked away with the
division title by 12 1/2 games last year.
</P>
<P>
   The outfield has only been a part of the team's hospital unit.
Third baseman Ken Caminiti, shortstop Ricky Gutierrez and catcher
Mitch Meluskey have also missed significant time because of
injuries. Meluskey is out for the season. Manager Larry Dierker was
out one month because of brain surgery after he suffered a seizure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has been through a lot,'' Caminiti said. ``The last
two weeks have been really bad. But there's a lot of good character
on this team. You just can't dwell on (the injuries).''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros have some hope the curse may be lifting. Bell was
activated from the disabled list Wednesday, and Everett could be
back in seven to 10 days. Hunsicker, who picked up outfielder Matt
Mieske last month, added more depth Tuesday by acquiring veteran
outfielder Stan Javier from the San Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   That gives the Astros hope they'll have a veteran outfield in
place for the stretch run and the playoffs. It would keep them from
having to rely on their two prized rookies, Ward and Berkman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both are a big part of our future,'' Hunsicker said. ``But
down the stretch, when you're in a pressure situation and every
game counts, experience plays a big factor. To ask those kids to
step into that kind of situation is asking a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   During spring training, the Astros were hoping Alou would return
in time for the stretch run. They announced then he would miss five
months because of a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left
knee. His goal was to return in mid-August, but that eventually
proved too optimistic. Then he fell off a bicycle playing with his
3-year-old son Sunday _ ``Poor judgment,'' Hunsicker said _ and now
the Astros have all but given up hope he'll be back for the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the Astros outfield can a guy suffer two season-ending
injuries in one season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing that really hurts,'' Dierker said. ``It
seemed like we were trying to hold the line until mid-August,
late-August until he got back. Then when he rejoined the club (for
rehabilitation) in August, you could see the desire to get him back
became tangible, you could almost feel it in the clubhouse. This
hurts, but there hasn't been anything easy about this season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros expected to do some serious bashing this year after
they added Caminiti to a lineup that led the National League with a
club-record 874 runs last year. Hunsicker said in spring training
that the Astros wouldn't need an Atlanta Braves-type pitching staff
because the offense was so good.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out it has been the reverse. The Astros began September
with 660 runs, ninth-most in the league. But the pitching staff has
saved them.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hampton (17-3, 2.97 earned-run average), Jose Lima (18-7,
3.35 ERA) and Billy Wagner (1.90 ERA, 33 saves) were All-Stars, and
Shane Reynolds (14-11, 3.80 ERA) has been almost as good. Scott
Elarton (7-4, 3.12 ERA) has pitched well enough to show why the
Astros didn't want to give him up in a possible trade for Roger
Clemens. The Astros, despite losing Randy Johnson in the
off-season, are second in the league in pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were fortunate the pitching staff, especially the starting
staff, stepped it up big,'' Hunsicker said.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros don't expect the Reds to go away, and a two-game
series against them Sept. 28-29 at the Astrodome could decide the
division. But the Astros also believe much could change before then
with the addition of Javier and by getting Bell and Everett back.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can keep the ship afloat for the next seven-10 days and
have everybody healthy, I believe we have the best team in the
division,'' Hunsicker said. ``We can win it.'' nn

FOR SOONERS PLAYERS, FANS, STOOPS IS TALKING THEIR LANGUAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORMAN, Okla. _ Perhaps Bob Stoops has not been a head coach
long enough to learn the verbal two-step, though during his
eight-month tenure at the helm of the Oklahoma football program
he's already established a reputation for plain-speak _ in marked
contrast to many college football coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been incredibly impressed with both coach Stoops
and his staff,'' OU Alumni Association director Paul Massad said.
``He relates extremely well to people. He doesn't put them off when
he gets a direct question. He doesn't use excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoops has openly informed a rabid OU following that longs for a
return to the thrilling days of yesteryear that indeed it is all
right to expect the Sooners to win on Saturday. Any Saturday.
Beginning now. Forget any long-range rebuilding plan to bring the
program out of the depths of the first three consecutive losing
seasons since the university first fielded a football team in 1895.
</P>
<P>
   Stoops, defensive coordinator at Florida last season, figured
what the heck. No harm in telling them what they want to hear. And
no point in not doing it, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't think they'd think that no matter what I say?''
Stoops said with a laugh on a recent afternoon. ``We've won too
many championships here and had too many great teams that these
people shouldn't want \Rto win every game\S. We're no different
from a lot of tradition-rich programs _ they all want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a gaudy past, Oklahoma has not won as much as a
conference championship since 1987. Nor have the Sooners won as
many as 10 games in a dozen seasons. In three seasons under Stoops'
predecessor, John Blake, the Sooners were 12-22.
</P>
<P>
   But Stoops' message of immediate returns has not been only for
public consumption.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has impressed me,'' said quarterback Josh Heupel, a
junior-college transfer who wasn't around during the John Blake
era, ``is that these coaches really and truly believe they can do
it quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't they all? What makes this brash young coach in his first
job any different than Blake or his flash-in-a-season predecessor
Howard Schnellenberger? At this juncture _ less than 10 days before
Stoops' first kickoff on the OU sidelines _ everything. And that's
according to someone who should know.
</P>
<P>
   Sixth-year senior Jay Smith has experienced something no other
player in OU history has _ four head coaches. Before the former
Lamar High School offensive lineman arrived in Norman, OU had gone
28 years with four head coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a different story,'' Smith declared.
``This is a different era. You can see that just in our practices.
There's not a lot of standing around in line. Everyone is involved,
everyone is getting their reps in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches are working us hard and teaching us how to win
games. The players' attitude is so much better. Last year, we
weren't mentally or physically prepared. We didn't even have an
offensive playbook. It seemed we didn't even have a game plan. You
can't go out and win games like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The frustration goes back to Schnellenberger's lone season
(5-5-1) in 1995. OU lost four of its last five games, failed to
score in its last two and lost to archrival Oklahoma State for the
first time since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Recall that Schnellenberger was going to be the coach that would
once again make Oklahoma a big winner, after Gary Gibbs compiled a
44-23-2 record during six seasons that included probation
limitations after succeeding the legend-in-his-own-time Barry
Switzer in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   As Schnellenberger's only season went on, ``the players lost
respect for him,'' Smith said. ``There were several on and
off-the-field things that happened to cause that, and the team
spiraled downhill because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   OU is 2-5-1 in the past four years against Texas and Oklahoma
State, 0-3 against Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   How soon the Sooners hope to forget. Fans and students have
flocked to the ticket windows to purchase more than 50,000 season
packages for the first time since 1992. The surge has been such
that ticket manager Tom Blubaugh is still holding individual
tickets for the season-ending OSU game to ensure he can fill those
season ticket orders still coming in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had 200 calls for season tickets in the 48 hours after Bob
Stoops was hired,''` Blubaugh recalled. ``People are definitely
excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoops' staff has worked as hard at changing this team's psyche
as it has at bringing structure to its offensive and defensive
schemes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A team that hasn't won for a few years, there's reasons why,''
Stoops said. ``Often, it's the mental approach _ the tenacity they
don't have. Their mental approach to winning needs to improve.
Their expectations need to rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got a good nucleus of players we should be able
to win with. The thing we've got to do is get the most out of the
talent we have. If we do that and we have a few guys who
overachieve, we've got enough to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoops' straightforward approach early won over a team
desperately searching for leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Stoops is a great guy,'' senior safety Rodney Rideau
said. ``He preaches discipline, getting the job done and he
preaches excellence. That's what we want to hear, what it takes to
win. There's no doubt he's brought structure and organization back
to the team. He sets goals and encourages us to set goals _ and to
live by them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came from a winning tradition. And hopefully, he'll bring
it back to us.''

FOR SOONERS PLAYERS, FANS, STOOPS IS TALKING THEIR LANGUAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORMAN, Okla. _ Perhaps Bob Stoops has not been a head coach
long enough to learn the verbal two-step, though during his
eight-month tenure at the helm of the Oklahoma football program
he's already established a reputation for plain-speak _ in marked
contrast to many college football coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been incredibly impressed with both coach Stoops
and his staff,'' OU Alumni Association director Paul Massad said.
``He relates extremely well to people. He doesn't put them off when
he gets a direct question. He doesn't use excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoops has openly informed a rabid OU following that longs for a
return to the thrilling days of yesteryear that indeed it is all
right to expect the Sooners to win on Saturday. Any Saturday.
Beginning now. Forget any long-range rebuilding plan to bring the
program out of the depths of the first three consecutive losing
seasons since the university first fielded a football team in 1895.
</P>
<P>
   Stoops, defensive coordinator at Florida last season, figured
what the heck. No harm in telling them what they want to hear. And
no point in not doing it, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't think they'd think that no matter what I say?''
Stoops said with a laugh on a recent afternoon. ``We've won too
many championships here and had too many great teams that these
people shouldn't want \Rto win every game\S. We're no different
from a lot of tradition-rich programs _ they all want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a gaudy past, Oklahoma has not won as much as a
conference championship since 1987. Nor have the Sooners won as
many as 10 games in a dozen seasons. In three seasons under Stoops'
predecessor, John Blake, the Sooners were 12-22.
</P>
<P>
   But Stoops' message of immediate returns has not been only for
public consumption.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has impressed me,'' said quarterback Josh Heupel, a
junior-college transfer who wasn't around during the John Blake
era, ``is that these coaches really and truly believe they can do
it quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't they all? What makes this brash young coach in his first
job any different than Blake or his flash-in-a-season predecessor
Howard Schnellenberger? At this juncture _ less than 10 days before
Stoops' first kickoff on the OU sidelines _ everything. And that's
according to someone who should know.
</P>
<P>
   Sixth-year senior Jay Smith has experienced something no other
player in OU history has _ four head coaches. Before the former
Lamar High School offensive lineman arrived in Norman, OU had gone
28 years with four head coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a different story,'' Smith declared.
``This is a different era. You can see that just in our practices.
There's not a lot of standing around in line. Everyone is involved,
everyone is getting their reps in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches are working us hard and teaching us how to win
games. The players' attitude is so much better. Last year, we
weren't mentally or physically prepared. We didn't even have an
offensive playbook. It seemed we didn't even have a game plan. You
can't go out and win games like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The frustration goes back to Schnellenberger's lone season
(5-5-1) in 1995. OU lost four of its last five games, failed to
score in its last two and lost to archrival Oklahoma State for the
first time since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Recall that Schnellenberger was going to be the coach that would
once again make Oklahoma a big winner, after Gary Gibbs compiled a
44-23-2 record during six seasons that included probation
limitations after succeeding the legend-in-his-own-time Barry
Switzer in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   As Schnellenberger's only season went on, ``the players lost
respect for him,'' Smith said. ``There were several on and
off-the-field things that happened to cause that, and the team
spiraled downhill because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   OU is 2-5-1 in the past four years against Texas and Oklahoma
State, 0-3 against Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   How soon the Sooners hope to forget. Fans and students have
flocked to the ticket windows to purchase more than 50,000 season
packages for the first time since 1992. The surge has been such
that ticket manager Tom Blubaugh is still holding individual
tickets for the season-ending OSU game to ensure he can fill those
season ticket orders still coming in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had 200 calls for season tickets in the 48 hours after Bob
Stoops was hired,''` Blubaugh recalled. ``People are definitely
excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoops' staff has worked as hard at changing this team's psyche
as it has at bringing structure to its offensive and defensive
schemes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A team that hasn't won for a few years, there's reasons why,''
Stoops said. ``Often, it's the mental approach _ the tenacity they
don't have. Their mental approach to winning needs to improve.
Their expectations need to rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got a good nucleus of players we should be able
to win with. The thing we've got to do is get the most out of the
talent we have. If we do that and we have a few guys who
overachieve, we've got enough to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoops' straightforward approach early won over a team
desperately searching for leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Stoops is a great guy,'' senior safety Rodney Rideau
said. ``He preaches discipline, getting the job done and he
preaches excellence. That's what we want to hear, what it takes to
win. There's no doubt he's brought structure and organization back
to the team. He sets goals and encourages us to set goals _ and to
live by them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came from a winning tradition. And hopefully, he'll bring
it back to us.''

NHRA, TEXAS TRACK AIM AT MEMORIAL WEEKEND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Hot Rod Association is preparing to enter the
crowded Memorial Day weekend racing schedule with a national event
at the Texas Motorplex next year.
</P>
<P>
   Motorplex owner Billy Meyer said he has been working with NHRA
president Dallas Gardner to move the 3-year-old Castrol Nationals
from its late-April/early May slot to Memorial Day weekend. Meyer
said Tuesday that he has not seen a draft of the 2000 schedule,
which is expected to be released during the 45th annual U.S.
Nationals at Indianapolis Raceway Park on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing that would make me believe that it is not
going to happen,'' said Meyer, referring to the date switch. ``But
until there is actual confirmation in writing ... it's better to
take the approach it's our assumption it's going to happen. I think
it will be a huge benefit to the spring race and give NHRA the
ability to be highlighted in the national market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to associate Memorial Day weekend with the
Motorplex and the Castrol Nationals.'' If the dates are switched
and follow the typical NHRA professional format, the fourth annual
Castrol Nationals would be run at the Motorplex in Ennis from May
26-28. That will put the event's final day up against two
established races. The 84th Indianapolis 500, the world's most
famous auto race, runs at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. And the
Coca-Cola 600, NASCAR's longest race, is a tradition at the Lowe's
Motor Speedway in Concord, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had a desire to move to Memorial Day weekend for some
time, and we don't consider it `competition' by any means,'' Meyer
said. ``We consider it the fact that the NHRA is the only one of
the three major motorsports that doesn't have a spectator event on
one of the biggest holiday weekends in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer said the weather in late May in North Texas is similar to
conditions in October, when the track plays host to the NHRA's
O'Reilly Fall Nationals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us an automatic rain date that is a positive for
the spectators,'' Meyer said. The third annual Castrol Nationals
drew approximately 112,000 spectators over a three-day schedule.
</P>
<P>
   A former NHRA Funny Car driver, Meyer said the sanctioning body
most recently raced on Memorial Day weekend in 1990 at State
Capitol Dragway in Erwinville, La.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that event went away, it was never replaced,'' Meyer
said. ``Our sales pitch was a little bit different. We felt that
with the reputation of the Motorplex _ and taking the assumption
there's going to be a new Motorplex in the future _ it would be a
perfect place to showcase NHRA on one of the biggest holiday
weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer is negotiating with the Grand Prairie City Council to move
the Motorplex to a new $74 million facility in 2001. The proposed
site is the intersection of Interstate 30 and MacArthur Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer said he was not certain how the race's TV rights would be
handled. The Indy 500 (ABC) and Coca-Cola 600 (TBS) are televised
live.
</P>
<P>
   ``That somewhat depends on the new NHRA TV package that is close
to being put together,'' Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a source said that Houston Raceway Park in Baytown
will retain both its spring and fall races next year; that the
Winston Showdown all-star event will be staged for the second
consecutive year at Bruton Smith's revamped Bristol (Tenn.)
Dragway; and that the only new event will be at Smith's Las Vegas
Motor Speedway in early April. nn

 &HT;    EMPLOYER-PROVIDED HOUSING DRAWS MANY HISPANIC WORKERS
 &HT;    With CHANGING-SOUTH. For release Sunday, Sept. 5.
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MT. OLIVE, N.C. _ At the largest turkey processing plant in the
nation, Juvencio Rocha Peralta holds two key positions _ associate
housing manager and resident compadre.
</P>
<P>
   At Carolina Turkeys, it's hard to tell which job carries more
weight.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to managing 120 housing units, Peralta has become an
important resource for a growing number of Hispanic employees,
already 65 percent of the plant's work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ask me _ 'Juvencio, how can I get my child enrolled in
school? Juvencio, where is the closest church? Juvencio, I got this
ticket, what should I do?' `` he said with a chuckle. ``I guess
after time, they realize that I know all these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Peralta graciously assumes the role of community liaison after
20 years of working in North Carolina, including long stretches in
farm and construction jobs. He organizes Latino festivals, plans
soccer tournaments and has become involved in local and state
health care and education issues.
</P>
<P>
   Having lived through the migration experience, he has strong
empathy for the plant's 2,800 workers, many of whom recently
arrived and are going through the same culture shock that he felt
at 16 when he came from Veracruz, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   He knows, for example, that it is very hard to rent an apartment
without established credit, rent history or even a checkbook.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina Turkeys' solution: employee housing. Peralta makes the
arrangements and guides the workers step by step.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy _ if you work, you pay,'' Peralta said, describing
the company's policy of deducting rent directly from paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   The housing _ almost completely rented by Hispanics _ is a
five-minute car ride from the plant, which is open 24 hours a day.
The white and cream-colored trailer homes are well maintained and
fully furnished.
</P>
<P>
   The housing sports some unexpected amenities, such as a cement
basketball court and a large soccer field. Carolina Turkeys has
also donated nearby land for Catholic and Baptist churches with
Hispanic ministries.
</P>
<P>
   Esperanza Valdez, 41, lives in one of the homes with her five
children. She pays $320 a month in rent, plus the electric bill.
Hourly salaries at the plant range from $6.90 to $9 an hour and
employees have full benefits, including health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Two walls of Valdez's home are decorated with family photos and
certificates that her children won in school. Originally from the
Dominican Republic, Valdez arrived in North Carolina after living
in Puerto Rico for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, I feel good. I have a job, a safe place to live _ things
I didn't have before,'' she said, gazing down at her brightly
colored dining room tablecloth.
</P>
<P>
   Valdez and other renters do not have to sign a lease, Peralta
said. They can leave at any time if they find a better or cheaper
place, and the company will give them a good credit rating if they
have been there for a while. Peralta said he suspects Carolina
Turkeys may expand the housing if the company continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
   As he walks through the plant, where 80,000 birds are processed
daily, workers on all parts of the assembly line greet him warmly.
Wearing hair nets, white smocks, and rubber boots, some wave to
Peralta as the turkeys go by.
</P>
<P>
   Roel Cantu, who hails from Chiapas in southern Mexico, says the
plant is a wonderful place to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so much better,'' he said, referring to his previous
stint as a farm hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't sweat and get dirt all over your clothes and your
face. This is a clean job.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. _ It's no surprise that Rep. Bob Etheridge,
D-N.C., has an advisory group on farming and one on business
matters. But few would guess that he also keeps up with the needs
of another constituency group _ Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Latino population is growing so quickly. I saw it with the
public schools and worked very closely with them there,'' said
Etheridge, who served as superintendent of North Carolina schools
before his election to Congress in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are hard-working. They want to get into business. They
are tremendously family-oriented,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Etheridge created a Latino advisory committee to
learn more about the needs of Hispanics in his district, which
includes part of Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-member group includes community activists, members of the
Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and state and local officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to draw enough information from a broad group that I can
be a little bit more knowledgeable on the issues,'' Etheridge said.
In turn, he tries to keep the Hispanic community up to date with
the latest workings of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The most pressing issues for Hispanic constituents include
access to education and health care, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are special language needs that you really have to work
through,'' he said. ``Because if you don't help with the language
needs for children, you punish the next generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics in North Carolina are also very interested in
entrepreneurship, Etheridge said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Census, Hispanic-owned businesses in North
Carolina, concentrated in the service industry, more than tripled
between 1987 and 1992, from 918 to 2,802.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the advisory committee, Etheridge is reaching out
to new constituents by translating press releases and sending them
to Spanish-language radio stations and publications in his
district.
</P>
<P>
   On the state level, Gov. James Hunt has started an office of
Hispanic/Latino affairs and appointed Nolo Martinez as its first
director.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, a faculty member at North Carolina State University,
said Hispanics will continue to venture to North Carolina in record
numbers, attracted by its military bases, booming economy and
higher education opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no looking back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The office has an Internet site
(http://www.minorityaffairs.state.nc.us/hispaniclatino) in English
and Spanish.

   CLAYTON, N.C. _ They're sprinkled among the barbecue joints and
decrepit gas stations: an occasional Mexican bakery, or a store
window plastered with movie posters in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   In Raleigh, Durham and nearby rural areas, Latino faces are
everywhere _landscape workers trimming bushes, construction workers
pouring concrete, field workers hauling endless yellow bundles of
tobacco leaf.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina's large cities, small towns and rural areas are
being transformed as Hispanic professionals, entrepreneurs and
laborers become a growing part of the state's booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the positive economic effects, the influx is forcing
governments, schools, churches and health-care systems to make
rapid and sometimes costly adjustments.

echoing the red, white and green Mexican flag.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Mendez finds an assortment of Spanish-language compact
disks, Mexican action movies, imported sweets, fresh-baked
tortillas and other products with familiar brand names such as
``Tia Rosa'' and ``El Charrito.''
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old Mexican house painter from San Luis Potosi
smiles with a hint of melancholy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked only ten of the last fourteen days. It's not
enough,'' he said. ``But coming here makes me feel a little bit
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Jobs and a peaceful environment are attracting Hispanics such as
Mendez to North Carolina in record numbers, though officials
disagree what those numbers are.
</P>
<P>
   While the U.S. Census Bureau estimates that about 121,000 people
of Hispanic origin live in North Carolina, state officials say the
Hispanic population has doubled since 1990, to more than 200,000.
Meanwhile, Latino advocates and business leaders put the number
much higher, between 350,000 to 500,000.
</P>
<P>
   With a nationwide population of about 27 million, Hispanics are
projected to surpass African-Americans as the nation's largest
minority group in about eight years. While highly concentrated in
five states _ Texas, California, Illinois, New York and Florida _
Hispanics have increasingly been moving into other Southern states.
</P>
<P>
   A better place
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, Hispanics are mostly settling in some urban
communities along the Interstate 85 corridor, in western Piedmont
counties, in eastern farming areas and near military bases.
</P>
<P>
   They occupy an increasing number of jobs in the food and hotel
service industries, as well as in construction, landscaping and
livestock slaughterhouses.
</P>
<P>
   While Hispanics cite jobs as the top reason for venturing to
North Carolina, there is a clear second reason _ what many refer to
as ``tranquilidad,'' or ``peace of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a much better atmosphere,'' said Pedro Aguilar, 34, who
worked in Los Angeles for seven years cleaning office buildings
before moving to North Carolina with his wife and four children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more discipline in the schools compared to Los
Angeles. People there live without order. There are gangs
everywhere. I don't want those values to stick to my kids.'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Norma Herrera also came to North Carolina from Los Angeles in
search of steady work and a better environment for her teenage son.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a thousand times better,'' said Herrera, who is
Guatemalan and works at a turkey processing plant in Mount Olive.
``There is too much violence in California. Too many bullets. They
sell drugs in the schools. They get into it so quick. They forget
who they are. Forget about God. They finish dead or in jail or as
invalids in a hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebrahim Melendez, 47, who came to the United States from
Honduras in 1989, lived in New Jersey for five years before coming
to Raleigh with his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the smaller cities, smaller towns,'' he said. ``I like
the open spaces, the countryside. It's a state with a lot of
opportunity and above all, a lot of tranquility.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing problems
</P>
<P>
   While many Latinos sing the praises of their new, adopted state,
they also face many challenges.
</P>
<P>
   While not nearly at the levels of cities like Los Angeles or
Houston, crime is also a problem in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the first half of last year, nearly 100
Hispanics were victims of violent crimes in Durham, a number that
accounted for 15 percent of all violent-crime victims. That number
is roughly twice the percentage of Hispanics in Durham's
population.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Hispanics face a disproportionate number of crimes
because many have settled in low-income, traditionally high-crime
neighborhoods. In addition, many are unfamiliar with the criminal
justice system, have a distrust of police and speak little or no
English.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics in the state are also more likely to suffer accidents.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Hispanics made up about 2 percent of the state's
population, but accounted for 9 percent of its workplace deaths. In
addition, 25 percent of Hispanic deaths from 1995 to 1997 came in
motor vehicle accidents, as opposed to about 2 percent of white
deaths and 2.5 percent of African American deaths.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Hispanics in North Carolina face several health
care-related challenges some stemming from the language barrier. A
recent study recommended including $2.3 million in the state budget
next year for interpreter services at 85 local health departments
to remedy the situation.
</P>
<P>
   The study by the North Carolina Center for Public Policy
Research, a non-profit group funded mostly by private foundations,
found that Hispanics rely more heavily on local health departments
because they work in lower-wage and more dangerous jobs with fewer
benefits such as health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   This has put a heavy burden on some local agencies. The Durham
County Health Department reported serving 5,000 Hispanics in
1997-1998, or about 23 percent of its case load, and the Wilson
County Health Department reported that 30 percent of its clients
were Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   The study also revealed that only 69 percent of Hispanic women
receive prenatal care in the first trimester of pregnancy, compared
to 88 percent of white women and 77 percent of African-American
women. As a result, the study recommends an additional $250,000 in
next year's state budget to allow more health centers to provide
maternal care coordination services to women ineligible for
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   The study points out that Hispanic children are less likely than
the overall population to be immunized against childhood diseases.
It recommends funding immunization outreach workers in the 20 North
Carolina counties with the largest Hispanic populations.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics and local governments also face a growing challenge in
schooling. Several school districts are coping with the influx of
students who don't speak, read or write English. Many
administrators and teachers have expressed frustration with the
lack of resources for educating Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits have already been filed in some western North Carolina
counties such as Yadkin, Burke and Chatham on behalf of
non-English-speaking children, alleging that they are not getting
the free and appropriate education to which they're entitled under
federal law.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of these challenges, politicians are reacting. Gov.
Jim Hunt has started an Office of Hispanic/Latino Affairs, and Rep.
Bob Etheridge, a Democrat from Lillington, has created a Hispanic
advisory group and has begun translating some of his press releases
into Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   A new style of faith
</P>
<P>
   Religious organizations are also evolving as the population
shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Father John Heffernan, a priest at the Immaculate Conception
Catholic Church in Durham, realized things were changing about
three years ago when he first met ``Our Lady of Guadalupe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd heard the name, but I had no idea who she was,'' he said
of the image of the Virgin Mary that is revered by millions of
Mexican Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   According to the church, the Virgin Mary appeared to an Aztec
Indian 450 years ago as a haloed image in a starry blue cape coming
out of the clouds. Her image was miraculously imprinted onto the
man's poncho, which still adorns the basilica in Mexico City built
in her honor.
</P>
<P>
   At Immaculate Conception, she has become a constant presence. A
painting of Our Lady of Guadalupe now decorates a wall at the back
of the church, where worshipers can light votive candles and pray.
The church also has a statue of Our Lady of Guadalupe, which
Heffernan brings in front of the altar for Spanish-language
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   To serve the growing Latino population, Heffernan performs a
bilingual mass every Sunday. In addition, he performs Spanish
weddings, ``quinceaneras'' which celebrate a girl's 15th birthday,
and three times more Hispanic baptisms than all other groups
combined.
</P>
<P>
   He says he has grown very close to Our Lady of Guadalupe, who he
finds more cheerful than the church's Virgin of the Immaculate
Conception.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's beautiful,'' he said. ``I've come to love her.''
</P>
<P>
   Catholic churches are by no means alone in reaching out to North
Carolina's growing Hispanic community. Many other denominations
have embraced the new worshipers. Just down the road from
Immaculate Conception, Duke Memorial United Methodist Church has
signs on its lawn proclaiming in bold letters, ``Alabemos al
Senor,'' or ``Let's Praise the Lord,'' followed by information
about the church's Spanish-language activities, led by a minister
from Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Pan dulce and MTV
</P>
<P>
   Many Hispanics predict greater changes ahead for the state's
traditionally black and white landscape.
</P>
<P>
   A glimpse of the future appears in the pages of La Conexion,
which started as an eight-page publication about four years ago and
is now an 80-page, semi-weekly newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Run by the husband-and-wife team of Mike and Lupita Leary, the
Spanish-language paper includes local news, editorials, items from
Mexico, Latin America and Puerto Rico as well as separate sections
for entertainment and sports. The free publication is packed with
ads, including several for phone cards, satellite dishes and
money-wiring services.
</P>
<P>
   At Juanita's Bakery in Smithfield, Jose Arseo says he will stay
in North Carolina for as long as he can. Arseo came to North
Carolina three years ago from Nevada, where people were ``much more
racist'' and the jobs were ``not as nice and clean.''
</P>
<P>
   As he picks out some fresh ``pan dulce'' or sweet bread from a
glass bin, he tells Perla Joaquin at the counter that he just got
off work cleaning a nearby hotel and was heading home to his wife
and two children.
</P>
<P>
   As she takes his money she glances up at a TV screen in the
corner of the bakery _ it's Puerto Rican sensation Ricky Martin,
singing a pop song in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank goodness we have MTV en espanol,'' says the 18-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, near Mount Olive, a handful of men cut bundles of
tobacco leaf and throw them onto a truck. Despite 95 degree-heat,
the men are laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Altucer, 39, said he had arrived in North Carolina just
two days earlier, after a long journey from Campeche in southern
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two days and there's already work,'' he said. ``This is a
happy place.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: WHAT DOES GEORGE II STAND FOR?
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Sept. 5.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Historians say that for a British monarch, Charles
I had exquisite manners and few vices. But he lacked the common
touch and in 1649, after quarreling with Parliament, he got his
head chopped off.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing for changes in customs over 350 years, the sad fate of
the Stuart king resonates in the forced exit of George I from the
White House in 1993. The electorate felt that President Bush had
run out of gas.
</P>
<P>
   The analogy to the Stuarts continues with the rise of George II,
the Texas governor who would succeed his father, as Charles II
succeeded to the throne a decade after his daddy's departure. The
younger Charles was admired for his political adaptability but
accused by detractors of lacking core beliefs. The years of his
reign are known in English history as the Restoration period.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, there has been a persistent theme in the coverage of
the 2000 campaign that the younger Bush hasn't put a lot on the
table in terms of what he believes or where he wants to take the
country were he to win. One hears widely that, if he may not be
guilty of substance abuse, then he's certainly guilty of a lack of
substance.
</P>
<P>
   But for a politician criticized by Beltway insiders as being
inexperienced, untested and vague, Bush has molded a surprisingly
precise social doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   His stance, which hasn't been widely reported: The goal of the
current prosperity must be to leave nobody behind. Taxes should be
cut to spur growth but not, as happened during the Reagan era, to
gut federal programs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush notes how fellow Texan Lyndon Johnson once sought to forge
a secular Great Society. LBJ's pitch, he says, has ``become a
warning, not an example. We found that government can spend money,
but it can't put hope in our hearts or a sense of purpose in our
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   George II chucks aside constitutional strictures separating
church and state. His pitch: ``It is not enough for conservatives
like me to praise these (faith-based) efforts. It is not enough to
call for volunteerism. Without more support and resources _ both
private and public _ we are asking them to make bricks without
straw.''
</P>
<P>
   Major passages in Bush's social policy manifesto, titled ``The
Duty of Hope,'' read as if they could have been drafted by the Rev.
Jesse Jackson. When I pointed this out to Jackson the other day, he
looked at me over his half-moon glasses and said: ``He's not the
first politician to imitate Jesse Jackson. There's a gap between
the right language and reality.''
</P>
<P>
   If Jackson is mistaken, George II would try to put the politics
of faith in the policy saddle by pressing Congress to alter the tax
laws to favor religious charities. He would also nominate judges
inclined to reinterpret the Constitution in ways that would give
religion far greater prominence in public life.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, polls show that these views hardly serve as the
basis of Bush's political appeal. His strength derives instead from
his seeming electability as an all-around nice guy than from what
he might actually seek to accomplish in the new millennium _ were
there to be a reprise of the Stuarts' Glorious Restoration.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Road ahead is clear for the
Roadhouse
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGELINA COUNTY, Texas _ A nice lady phoned the other day,
concerned about the fate of the Lost in the '50s Roadhouse, that
little cafe north of town just this side of the river bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Awhile back I'd written that the route of the new interstate may
come right through the front door and out the back, leaving nothing
but a greasy spot in the road.
</P>
<P>
   Hereabouts, Lost in the '50s is important to lots of folks, from
the down-home good ol' boys to the uptown well-to-do. People you
run into at Sunday brunch at the country club you're likely to see
most any other day of the week munching juicy cheeseburgers at the
roadhouse.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time I entertain visiting journalists from the big
city. Invariably they'll want to have a meal at Lost in the '50s.
They like the decor especially, posters of James Dean, Clark Gable,
Marilyn Monroe, along with classic cars of the same era.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, there are the framed magazine ads from all those
years ago. My favorite promotes Chesterfields as the brand
recommended by more doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can smoke in the roadhouse, even big cigars. Just
don't go asking for decaffeinated coffee. The same goes for booze.
</P>
<P>
   The roadhouse is not a juke joint, this being a dry county, but
it has probably the best honky-tonk jukebox you'll find most
anywhere _ music from the 1950s at a price from the 1950s, 12 plays
for a dollar.
</P>
<P>
   With the original knotty pine paneling and wooden booths, it's a
museum for memories of the way cafes used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us have been worried that the Lost in the '50s may end
up a memory itself, lost to progress.
</P>
<P>
   The final decision for the route for the interstate has yet to
be announced. But I've been asking around.
</P>
<P>
   A fellow I know just up the highway, whose home is so close to
the bridge that he figures to lose his property regardless of which
way things go, has been keeping in touch with the highway
department as close as most anybody.
</P>
<P>
   And he says without a doubt the roadhouse will survive.
</P>
<P>
   Which is good enough for me. I'm the kind of reporter who stops
asking questions once he hears what he wants to hear.
</P>
<P>
   I passed along that word to Miz Sharon, who runs Lost in the
'50s along with her husband. She said that was good news, but she's
still waiting for official word.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'm hoping it'll come soon, and the roadhouse can
then proceed with a bit of progress of its own.
</P>
<P>
   From some time now Miz Sharon has been talking about adding a
dance floor, a project I'm much in favor of.
</P>
<P>
   It's the very dickens to listen to Little Jimmy Dickens or Hank
Williams or Carl Perkins and manage to sit still. If nothing else
it must be bad for the digestion, juicy cheeseburgers
notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Franchise places across the country spend hundreds of thousands
of dollars trying to fake the kind of atmosphere that Lost in the
'50s comes by naturally.
</P>
<P>
   It'd be a shame to lose such a landmark. The roadhouse is worthy
of a historical plaque. Or, at the very least, it's own on-off
ramp.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Pillow talk and the bomb
 &HT;    (For release Sunday, Sept. 5, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consider the scene: It is a lovely night along the Seine River
in Paris. An American posted there in U.S. government service has
met a beautiful Ukrainian woman working as an interpreter at the
Louvre. They share wine and chit-chat.
</P>
<P>
   One thing leads to another and that leads to the bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we start,'' the American tells the Ukrainian, ``I have
to fill out some forms and I need your help.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What you are talking about?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he begins, ``there's a new rule from the U.S.
Department of Energy that requires me to notify them if I have a
sexual liaison with a person from a country that is thought to have
nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, she is pulling up her stockings and looking for
the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninotchka, don't go,'' the American pleads. ``It's just a
formality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will tell you formality, my friend,'' she answers angrily.
``I am formally breaking relations with you. How's that for
formality?''
</P>
<P>
   This is not a scene from the classic Garbo East-West movie
``Silk Stockings.'' It's a real-life stance taken by the U.S.
Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
   It is amazing how many candidates are being elected to office
crusading for government to get off our backs and how government,
instead, not only stays on our backs but gets under the sheets as
well. Unable to keep track on its own, the department is requiring
67,000 workers to report any such liaisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``MEMO
</P>
<P>
   ``To: Department of Energy
</P>
<P>
   ``From: John Doe, Israel
</P>
<P>
   ``Subject: Sexual liaison
</P>
<P>
   ``Basha Horowitz, an Israeli, had a sexual liaison with me three
days ago, but she swears that Israel does not have nuclear weapons.
She says Israel always has denied having nuclear weapons and she
believes it. As we lay there in that quandary, we decided it was
silly to waste the moment on something we could not resolve. The
remainder of the evening was eventful, if you know what I mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Through history _ particularly in novels and films _ females
have been used to lure testosterone-packed males into giving up
secrets. And, of course, James Bond got just about everything he
ever wanted out of vivacious Russian female agents.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a reality to this, the department claims, and that
is Americans on overseas assignments often look in the direction of
a woman whose country may or may not be suspected of having the
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, madam, I was admiring you from my table and would
appreciate you joining me for an espresso.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, sir, that is very nice of you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But first I must ask. Do you come from a country that the U.S.
believes has nuclear weapons?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Waiter! Check please.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, do not think DOE is inflexible. The notice allows that if
the sexual encounter is a one-time-only and the female does not ask
for classified information, then just go ahead and enjoy yourself.
But, I presume, if in the midst of the liaison, she starts asking
about the thickness of the walls at Hoover Dam, report her
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Curran, counter-intelligence chief for the Energy Department,
was quoted by the Albuquerque Journal: ``There are many, many cases
of this. The 50-, 60-year-old person stationed overseas for months,
away from family and children, that person could be especially
vulnerable to this kind of effort.''
</P>
<P>
   And the 30- and 40-year-olds wouldn't? Why the distinction? Does
Viagra have anything to do with it?
</P>
<P>
   There are similar regulations within the Department of Defense,
as well as the FBI and CIA. For some time now, America's secrets
have been leaking faster than a faulty radiator. But it seems to me
that the people who gave away those secrets _ people like Jonathan
Pollard and Aldrich Ames _ didn't do it through bedroom dalliances;
they did it for money.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt America must protect its secrets, and I also
don't doubt that sex is a way to pry out some of those secrets. But
to provide a list of countries the U.S. says likely has nuclear
weapons and say those are the ones to avoid doesn't make sense to
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, Maria, it's so nice to see you again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, Marvin, let's have sex.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ho-ho-ho, Maria, your country does not have the bomb, right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right, Marvin.''
</P>
<P>
   Five steamy minutes later:
</P>
<P>
   ``Marvin?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, my dear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Explain to me, from the beginning, how an atom is split.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   One of these days, we'll have to pay this sly piper for dancing
to his happy tune. Call it the ``Gimme Gavotte.''
</P>
<P>
   Several recent studies agree: Our unrivaled gap between the
well-off and the poor continues to grow, as more wealth is
concentrated in fewer hands, the stock market boom favors the few
and executive pay zooms ahead while wages for working stiffs only
creep.
</P>
<P>
   The ratio of top executive pay to factory wages ballooned from
42 to 1 in 1980 to 419 to 1 last year. If workers' incomes had kept
pace, the average production employee would be making more than
$110,000 a year. It's really $29,000.
</P>
<P>
   A study of Congressional Budget Office data by the Center for
Budget and Policy Priorities finds the average inflation-adjusted,
after-tax income of the richest 1 percent of us will have more than
doubled between 1977 and 1999, while the average for middle incomes
will have increased only 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The wealthiest 2.7 million Americans have combined incomes equal
to those of the bottom 100 million. The richest 1 percent of
households owned nearly 40 percent of the nation's wealth in 1993;
the bottom 80 percent, 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A rising tide may raise most if not all boats _ but not evenly.
Workers on average have increased their productivity 12 percent
over this decade but have pocketed a real income boost of only 1.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many factors are at play here _ weak unions, Congresses that
balk at raising the minimum wage. A less progressive income tax.
Rocketing stock prices have hyper-inflated executive income, of
which stock options are a growing part. Welfare reform has slightly
increased income for most former recipients, but the poorest 10
percent has suffered a 15 percent income drop.
</P>
<P>
   The working poor get a break with the Earned Income Tax Credit,
which exempts them from most federal income tax. They still,
however, pay disproportionately high payroll (Social Security) and
excise (gas, alcohol) taxes. And the lowest 20 percent of
working-age couples pay 12.4 percent of their income in state and
local taxes, while the top 1 percent pay 5.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Well, hooray for doing well and, yes, the rich get richer and
the poor get poorer. But that is not fate. It is part luck, part
skill and initiative _ and part policy.
</P>
<P>
   No other industrial nation of 22 analyzed two years ago has such
a wide gap between its rich and poor. No other suffers, either,
such large swamps of poverty or lives with the miasma of social
problems they give off.
</P>
<P>
   Even to mention such matters is to be accused of inciting class
warfare, but American class warfare is fought top down. The
Republican tax cut would further widen the rich-poor gap.
</P>
<P>
   Web-site barons and software swanks are throwing up castles as
casually as medieval princelings. The starter mansions of their new
rich courtiers spring up overnight behind gated walls.
</P>
<P>
   But even this historic boom hasn't reached our poorest. You have
to wonder if there isn't a due bill out there somewhere. And if
there shouldn't be.

<P>
   According to the annual ``America's Best Colleges`` issue of
U.S. News &AMP; World Report, published Aug. 30, the best college in
the United States is the California Institute of Technology. This
was dramatic, since Caltech, while highly regarded, is not normally
thought of as No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Caltech was rated No. 9, while the top spot was an
uninteresting three-way tie among Harvard, Yale and Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does U.S. News rank colleges?'' asks U.S. News. The
``simple answer,'' the magazine says, is, ``We do it to help you
make one of the most important decisions of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   Another simple answer is that the annual college rankings (and
similar rankings of graduate schools and hospitals) are lucrative
and influential unlike anything else the No. 3 news magazine does.
Newsstand sales are almost double those of a normal issue, and a
paperback-book version sells a million copies. Colleges brag or
complain loudly about their scores, enhancing U.S. News either way.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their validity as measures of academic excellence, the
annual rankings are a brilliant gimmick for U.S. News. But there's
a problem. A successful feature like this requires surprise, which
means volatility. Nobody's going to pay much attention if it's
Harvard, Yale and Princeton again and again, year after year. Yet
the relative merits of America's top universities surely change
slowly, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, U.S. News does not just make up its ratings. It uses
a weighted average of 16 numerical factors such as average class
size, acceptance rate (fraction of applicants who are admitted) and
amount of alumni giving. Trouble is, any combination of these
factors just isn't going to change enough from year to year to keep
things interesting.
</P>
<P>
   So how on earth can U.S. News explain Caltech's one-year rise?
</P>
<P>
   The magazine tries to deny that there's anything odd about a
college improving so quickly. The ``best colleges'' story argues:
``Caltech has always been within striking distance of the top of
the chart. In 1989, Caltech was the No. 3 school, ahead of Harvard.
... Last year, Caltech had the fourth-highest score among national
universities.''
</P>
<P>
   The first assertion is irrelevant: We're not interested in the
10-year rise from third but rather in the one-year rise from ninth.
The second assertion is technically true but practically dishonest:
Caltech had the ``fourth-highest score'' last year only because
there were two three-way ties and one two-way tie among the eight
schools that beat it.
</P>
<P>
   But the real reason Caltech jumped eight spaces this year is
that the editors at U.S. News fiddled with the rules. The lead
story of the ``best colleges'' package says that a change in
``methodology ... helped'' make Caltech No. 1. Buried in a sidebar
is the flat-out concession that ``the effect of the change ... was
to move Caltech into first place.'' No ``helped'' about it.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Caltech didn't improve this year, and Harvard,
Yale, and Princeton didn't get any worse. If the rules hadn't
changed, HYP would still be ahead. If the rules had changed last
year, Caltech would have been on top a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if the U.S. News criteria are taken seriously, and if
they held steady, Caltech may actually have slipped in quality this
past year. Most indicators did not change compared to last year.
But graduation rate, number of classes with fewer than 20 students,
and percentage of faculty members who work full-time actually
declined. Only two indicators showed small improvements: percentage
of accepted students in top 10 percent of their high-school classes
went from 99 percent to 100 percent (big deal!), and Caltech's
acceptance rate fell from 23 percent to 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News denies that it changes the rules--as it does every
year--simply to change the results. Robert Morse, U.S. News'
statistical guru, explained that this year's ranking procedures are
an ``improvement'' over last year's. Doesn't that imply, I said,
that last year's rankings were inferior? And shouldn't U.S. News
apologize to anyone who made ``one of the most important decisions
of your life'' -- possibly turning down Caltech for
Princeton--based on rankings the magazine itself now regards as
inaccurate?
</P>
<P>
   Morse replied that he hadn't said the earlier ratings were
inferior. But if something improves, I pressed him, doesn't that
mean that it was less excellent before the improvement? Morse
grudgingly allowed that I was free to make that inference.
</P>
<P>
   I can't prove that U.S. News keeps changing the rules simply in
order to change the results. But if not, U.S. News ought to shy
away from horse-race headlines such as ``Caltech Comes out on
Top.'' A more honest summary might be ``We Finally Realize That
Caltech Is Tops.'' Or ``Caltech on Top (Until We Fiddle With Rules
Again).''
</P>
<P>
   So, how did Caltech come out on top? Well, one variable in a
school's ranking has long been educational expenditures per
student, and Caltech has traditionally been tops in this category.
But until this year, U.S. News considered only a school's ranking
in this category--first, second, etc.--rather than how much it
spent relative to other schools. It didn't matter whether Caltech
beat Harvard by $1 or by $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Two other schools that rose in their rankings this year were MIT
(from fourth to third) and Johns Hopkins (from 14th to seventh).
All three have high per-student expenditures and all three are
especially strong in the hard sciences. Universities are allowed to
count their research budgets in their per-student expenditures,
though students get no direct benefit from costly research their
professors are doing outside of class.
</P>
<P>
   In its ``best colleges'' issue two years ago, U.S. News made
precisely this point, saying it considered only the rank ordering
of per-student expenditures, rather than the actual amounts, on the
grounds that ``expenditures at institutions with large research
programs and medical schools are substantially higher than those at
the rest of the schools in the category.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, just two years ago, the magazine felt it unfair
to give Caltech, MIT, and Johns Hopkins credit for having lots of
fancy laboratories that don't actually improve undergraduate
education.
</P>
<P>
   Each of U.S. News' criteria can generate a quibble like this
one. But there is a larger philosophical flaw in the ``best
colleges'' rankings. Consider this analogy: Suppose you wanted to
rank baseball teams. You might choose some plausible criteria such
as players' lifetime batting averages and salaries, the coaches'
years of professional experience, and so on. To decide whether
these criteria were valid, and what relative weights to give them,
you would look at the figures for winning and losing teams of the
past. Because you know which teams are successful before you begin
your analysis--those that win--you can use mathematics to identify
similarities among those winning teams.
</P>
<P>
   But with the U.S. News rankings there is no objective way to
know which schools are winners before you begin your analysis. In
fact, determining the winners is the point of the exercise. So you
sit around and brainstorm about whether faculty resources (class
size, faculty salaries, etc.) or student graduation rates, for
instance, are more important to educational ``quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, U.S. News gives the two characteristics equal weight,
which seems reasonable. But if you told me that faculty resources
are twice as important as student graduation rates, that would seem
reasonable too.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Elfin, the retired U.S. News editor who more or less created
the current college rankings, has explained: ``We've come up with a
list that underscores intuitive judgments. We did not set out to
underscore [those] judgments; we set out with a methodology. That
it wound up this way is to me both a justification and a discovery
that we're on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a masterpiece of circular logic. Elfin is saying: 1) We
trust our methodology because it confirms our intuition; and 2) we
are confirmed in our intuition because it is supported by our
methodology.
</P>
<P>
   And the truth is that the rankings' success actually depends on
confounding most people's intuition. For example, by declaring that
Caltech is superior to Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Princeton, MIT and
so on. And why should people find that so hard to believe? Maybe
because you told them the opposite just last year.

SUDDENLY SINGLE: A TOUGH YEAR FOR BROOKE SHIELDS
</HEADLINE>
   (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's Hollywood Stars
entertainment column) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Hollywood Stars, a
weekly entertainment column with color and black-and-white art.)
 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Brooke Shields
in ``Suddenly Susan.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``It's been one of the roughest years of my life,'' says actress
Brooke Shields, who recently showed up at Los Angeles' Ritz-Carlton
Hotel to talk about how major surgery had saved the life of her
ailing series ``Suddenly Susan.''
 &HT;    At 34, the former child star seems more poised and polished than
ever: Shields is stunning in a coral silk jacket worn over a
billowing black silk dress, which falls to her sandal-clad ankles.
 &HT;    Her famous locks are streaked blonde now, and they fall to a
mature shoulder level.
 &HT;    Some call it the best hair in Hollywood.
 &HT;    In the last few months, Shields has survived a series of
difficult personal experiences which, in combination, might have
felled a less balanced individual.
 &HT;    Her ``annus horribilus,'' to use Queen Elizabeth's phrase, began
late last year, when a London newspaper ran an erroneous front page
story, complete with photograph, alleging that she had been
arrested at France's Nice Airport and charged with drug possession.
 &HT;    In fact, the picture showed airport police acting as Shields'
private escort as she dodged the paparazzi.
 &HT;    The daily ran a front-page apology, but Shields had been deeply
hurt.
 &HT;    Then, in March 1999, her ``Suddenly Susan'' co-star David
Strickland hung himself in a seedy Las Vegas motel after an
alcohol-and-drugs binge.
 &HT;    Shields was shattered: Strickland had been more than just a
professional colleague. The two had become firm friends, and she
was bereft.
 &HT;    ``When your best friend dies,'' she says, ``you know your life
will never be the same again. You go through rites of passage,
intellectual and emotional. That definitely stopped me and slowed
me right down.''
 &HT;    Shields used her clout on the show to insist that the final
episode of the season be a tribute to Strickland.
 &HT;    Then, in April, she became ``suddenly single'' when her
29-year-old tennis superstar husband Andre Agassi filed for
divorce.
 &HT;    Their fairy-tale marriage had lasted a little under two years.
 &HT;    As if that weren't enough, she learned that NBC, citing poor
ratings, was on the verge of dumping her show.
 &HT;    But the network thought twice, and Shields was granted a
reprieve: ``Suddenly Susan'' would get a major makeover, new
characters would be introduced and joie de vivre would be the order
of the day.
 &HT;    The show returns to the network on September 19.
 &HT;    ``I'm so glad it's not finished,'' Shields says. ``We've gone
over it with a fine-tooth comb because we've gotten off the track a
little bit. Everything we fell in love with originally, we wanted
to make sure that would be revisited.''
 &HT;    Shields is upbeat and energized, talks cheerfully about her
comings and goings, though she is more guarded than usual and
chooses her words carefully when it comes to her private life.
 &HT;    Professionally, she's delighted to be getting a new love
interest on the show (``Melrose Place's'' handsome Rob Estes). And
Susan's San Francisco-based magazine will have a frenetic new boss,
played by Monty Python's Eric Idle.
 &HT;    ``I'm thrilled Eric's joining the show,'' Shields enthuses.
``I've been a Monty Python fan since I was a kid.''
 &HT;    About her ``darn cute'' love interest on the show, she adds:
``Sure there will be romance, but we didn't want to put Susan into
a long-term relationship yet.
 &HT;    ``I wanted her to be able to discover who she really is without
a man in her life. Susan is still stumbling through life and trying
to find herself in this world.''
 &HT;    Shields pauses to re-gain control of the interview, which
appears to have strayed a little close to home.
 &HT;    `` A lot of my friends seem to think I'm very much like Susan.
And it's usually after I've just run into a wall or something.
We're both klutzy, but she's less jaded than I am,'' Shields says.
 &HT;    ``And when I say that I mean I feel like I've been around longer
and I think I've seen more. And she's so much more willing at the
beginning of every situation to implicitly trust people.
 &HT;    ``And I think that over the years, although I want to stay as
open as she has, I have to work at it a little bit harder,'' she
adds.
 &HT;    When asked point-blank about her relationship with Agassi, she
says softly:
 &HT;    ``We're best friends _ we always will be. You can't spend so
much time with someone and then just walk away.''
 &HT;    Ironic, considering that it was Agassi who decided to end their
marriage. In court papers, the tennis star insisted there was ``no
possibility of reconciliation,'' adding that the two no longer had
anything in common.
 &HT;    In the past, Shields has admitted that the pressures of her
television career, coupled with Agassi's struggle to regain his
youthful power on the court, had brought too much pressure to bear
on their marriage.
 &HT;    In addition, Shields' influential mother had made no bones about
her distaste for Agassi, whose sun-baked tennis court manner and
taste for Las Vegas casinos seemed worlds removed from Shields'
well-pressed Ivy-League background.
 &HT;    ``I was putting in 12 to 14-hour days on a sound stage in
Hollywood, while Andre was trying to put his tennis game back
together again. It was not a good prescription for a happy
marriage,'' Shields told a co-worker while in the throes of her
break-up with the tennis ace.
 &HT;    But this June, following a series of professional setbacks,
Agassi bounced back to win the French Open and subsequently made it
through to the Wimbledon finals, losing to Pete Sampras but
emerging as the world's number-one seeded tennis player.
 &HT;    And Shields flew to London to be near him.
 &HT;    ``I guess you could say it was to console him,'' Shields
explains. ``I feel we are still so close that he needed someone to
be there for him. It's sometimes quite emotional, and I do love to
watch him play.
 &HT;    ``Obviously I can't be at every tournament. I want my career and
he wants his,'' she adds.
 &HT;    While Shields swears she no longer wants to be a ``tennis
groupie,'' she notes that many of her best friends have begun to
raise families, and she wants children.
 &HT;    The day after her interview, Shields is up in the UCLA stands,
watching her ex-husband compete in yet another tournament.
Reconciliation is in the air.
 &HT;    Says one close friend of the couple, well aware of their renewed
relationship: ``Andre can't live without her, and she can't live
without him. It's a strange combination.
 &HT;    ``But I wouldn't bet against them trying to make a go of it
again.''

 KATE MULGREW WARPS INTO ``VOYAGER'S'' SIXTH SEASON

 (FOR RELEASE THE WEEK OF MON., SEPT. 13, 1999) 
 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of actress Kate
Mulgrew in ``Voyager.'')
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Kate Mulgrew is psyched.
 &HT;    ``I'd say the tone of `Voyager' is much freer, much more
personal and much more dangerous as we get into season six,'' says
Mulgrew, who once again assumes the captain's chair as Kathryn
Janeway when ``Voyager'' returns to the airwaves on September 22.
 &HT;    ``There's also no question that we're going after a
broader-based audience now. We'd love to find more viewers, both
those who watched `Deep Space Nine' and anyone else who's willing
to see what we're doing.''
 &HT;    What they're doing is making space safe from deadly aliens, and
making Wednesday nights sacred for born-again trekkies.
 &HT;    ``When I say `Voyager' is more personal, that's precisely what
they've done. They're approaching the show from the inside out,''
Mulgrew say.
 &HT;    ``Anybody who tunes in will think, `Oh, that's interesting. What
is that woman B'Elanna (Roxann Dawson) doing that for?' It's no
longer just about the ship, the constraints of the ship and our
circumstances.''
 &HT;    Mulgrew, speaking by telephone from her home in Los Angeles on a
day off, pauses only long enough to breathe in some air before
continuing.
 &HT;    ``Our first episodes of the season have not only been more
personal, but they've been extravagant, more so than ever before.
And I mean that on every level,'' Mulgrew says.
 &HT;    ``We've worked longer and harder hours, and we've probably spent
much more money per episode. Everyone is, in a sense, bending over
backwards to extend themselves to this larger audience by getting
across, as best we can, these pretty interesting stories.''
 &HT;    Season six kicks off with ``Equinox, Part II,'' which resolves
the fifth-season cliffhanger.
 &HT;    Matters looked rather bleak for Capt. Janeway and her crew when
last seen, as aliens closed in and Capt. Ransom (John Savage) of
the U.S.S. Equinox seemed ready to sacrifice everybody on Voyager
in order to get himself and his crew back home.
 &HT;    What happens in ``Equinox, Part II''?
 &HT;    ``I don't die, I can tell you that,'' Mulgrew says, laughing.
``It looks like there's a lot of me with (actor) John Savage, but
that's editing, because it's mostly me on the bridge acting against
a lot of things that weren't there and being extremely technically
proficient.
 &HT;    ``In terms of the story, it's Janeway assuring Ransom and his
people that I'd go down with the ship rather than let him take
over. In the end, of course, he doesn't, but why he doesn't is
interesting.
 &HT;    ``It's the kind of twist that's typical of the first six
episodes you'll see this season.''
 &HT;    Another intriguing development on tap: Janeway should finally
beam some romance into her hectic life.
 &HT;    ``It'll be a very big romance, very powerful and
heartbreaking,'' she says. ``I want it long-lasting. I want it so
unpredictable that it throws Janeway for the biggest loop you've
ever seen her thrown for.''
 &HT;    Speaking of romance, Mulgrew recently wed Cleveland-based
politician Tim Hagan. They met in Ireland just before Mulgrew
landed ``Voyager,'' but the timing didn't work out.
 &HT;    Mulgrew went on to a relationship with frequent ``Trek''
director Rick Kolbe. When that ended last year, Mulgrew's mother
suggested to Hagan that he call Mulgrew. He did, they got together
and love bloomed anew.
 &HT;    The relationship, not to mention Mulgrew's guilt over missing
major events in the lives of her two sons, led the actress to very
publicly hint that she might not return to ``Voyager.''
 &HT;    Her comments sent shockwaves through ``Trek'' fandom.
 &HT;    Ultimately, the ``Trek'' producers agreed to coordinate
Mulgrew's schedule with ``extra vigilance.''
 &HT;    That meant fewer days sitting at home idly, waiting to be called
into the studio, and fewer instances of shooting a single scene on
a given day.
 &HT;    ``The acknowledgment of my need for time was crucial, and they
did acknowledge it,'' she says. ``They stepped up to the plate.''
 &HT;    Now a happy camper personally and professionally, Mulgrew is
fervent in her commitment to ``Voyager.''
 &HT;    She's deep into season six and signed for a seventh year. And
she has her eye on the future.
 &HT;    ``After `Voyager,' Kate Mulgrew lives her life,'' she says. ``I
will be immersed in my marriage and family. If I have any courage
at all I'll be quiet for a while and be reflective.
 &HT;    ``Perhaps I'll write about my seven years on `Voyager.' I may
move to Cleveland. Then, after some time has gone by, if I'm still
desirable to the theater, I'll go to New York and do a play.''

 By STEPHEN L. COHEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The story of the greatest public health disaster in U.S. history
is not a happy one. But it has all the ingredients of the best
Hollywood thrillers: sensational battles, ruthless power plays,
spine-tingling suspense and more than enough life-and-death
struggles to go around.
 &HT;    It all started innocently enough. The captains of the tobacco
industry probably saw little cause for alarm when the first
tentative shots were fired in their direction five years ago.
 &HT;    They'd been shot at before, after all, but their indomitable
domain had never been successfully breached, despite repeated
attacks over the years.
 &HT;    But all that was about to change. Indeed, when FDA Commissioner
David Kessler began his assault on the cigarette companies in 1994,
he set in motion a chain of events that would change the course of
the tobacco wars forever.
 &HT;    Under his leadership, the anti-smoking forces would go on to win
some major, unprecedented victories on the battlefield. They
actually defeated Big Tobacco in multiple arenas -- in the courts,
in Congress and in the battle for public opinion.
 &HT;    These victories culminated in the approval of the McCain bill
last year in the Senate Commerce Committee. The bill called for
severe penalties on the cigarette companies and was vigorously
opposed by the industry.
 &HT;    For a while, it looked as though the industry was in for a
devastating defeat, but in the final showdown on the Senate floor,
the tobacco lobby was able to prevail.
 &HT;    Following an industry-funded advertising blitz (estimated to
cost $40 million), the full Senate allowed the McCain bill to die.
With this defeat, any hope for an imminent end to the tobacco
blight died too.
 &HT;    Reeling from this unexpected setback, the anti-smoking forces
regrouped and tried to assess the damage. Recriminations filled the
air. Some blamed public health advocates like Kessler for pushing
too hard for tough legislation. Others cited the impact of the
tobacco industry's multi-million dollar ad campaign.
 &HT;    But no one could deny a pivotal reality: that any ambitious
anti-smoking legislation faced an uphill battle in the Republican
Congress. This was because any measure that expanded government
regulation or taxation, however important, would be suspect for
those reasons alone.
 &HT;    From the outset, then, the McCain bill was hampered by the fact
that the very measures needed to attack smoking -- from increased
cigarette prices to FDA regulation -- ran against the grain of
Republican thinking in the Senate.
 &HT;    For this reason, the debate shifted from the real issue -- the
health of the country -- to a debate about tax increases and Big
Government. The end result was a tragedy for the nation.
 &HT;    Since the defeat of the McCain bill, 46 states have reached an
agreement to settle claims against the tobacco industry for $206
billion. Four other states reached separate settlements for a total
of $40 billion. At this point, these settlements are the only
legacy of the failed McCain legislation.
 &HT;    So what happens now? Is there really no way to prevent the
single most preventable cause of death in the country? What are we,
a bunch of morons?
 &HT;    Hopefully not. But for more than 40 years, one could be forgiven
for coming to that conclusion. The reasons are all too clear.
Smoking kills more than 400,000 Americans a year and is responsible
for about 20 percent of all deaths in the United States. It's a
killer of staggering proportions. Yet we've allowed this wound to
fester for decades.
 &HT;    The question is, why have we done so little about one of the few
conditions that we actually know how to cure?
 &HT;    The tobacco companies have obviously had a huge impact. Since
evidence of the dangers of smoking first surfaced, the companies
have used their immense financial and political clout to fight
virtually any anti-tobacco initiative, from new cigarette taxes to
anti-smoking ordinances.
 &HT;    They've also mounted massive campaigns to refute the evidence
that smoking is hazardous to one's health, despite overwhelming
evidence to the contrary. In the final reckoning, history is
unlikely to look kindly on an industry that worked so hard to the
detriment of so many.
 &HT;    But who else shares responsibility for what is arguably the
greatest public health debacle in U.S. history? The cigarette
makers clearly didn't operate in a vacuum. So where were those
charged with protecting the public's health -- the nation's
government and medical leaders, for example -- all these years?
 &HT;    According to Kessler, officials at the Federal Trade Commission
did try to address the tobacco problem, but they were stymied by
higher authorities, including FTC commissioners and congressional
opponents.
 &HT;    Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop also worked to foster
anti-smoking activism during his term in the Reagan administration.
 &HT;    But Kessler acknowledges that his own agency, the FDA, never
focused a great deal of attention on tobacco prior to his arrival,
and that government research on subjects like nicotine addiction
(involving self-administration of nicotine) was about five years
behind industry research.
 &HT;    Members of the medical establishment played a role in
maintaining the status quo regarding smoking as well. In the
academic community, researchers accepted grants from the Committee
for Tobacco Research, an industry-funded group, to do studies on
tobacco. By engaging in industry-supported research, these
scientists provided cigarette makers with added credibility at a
time when the industry was vigorously disputing the evidence that
smoking was dangerous.
 &HT;    Organized medicine played a role, too. Kessler cites a 1964
British report on smoking and health that found that the American
Medical Association appeared ``more concerned with safeguarding the
financial interests of doctors through political lobbying than with
the doctors' patients.''
 &HT;    From his own study of the issue, Kessler concludes that
organized medicine in the '60s seemed more interested in courting
its relationships with tobacco state congressmen (to fight the
passage of Medicare) than in fighting smoking.
 &HT;    Of course, there were also dedicated anti-smoking advocates
through the years who pushed for measures like warning labels on
cigarette packages and the elimination of tobacco ads on
television. But for decades, no one was able to mobilize the
anti-smoking forces into a coalition that could effectively take on
the tobacco lobby.
 &HT;    As a result, the most lethal, preventable malady of the modern
age was allowed to kill millions of Americans with little effective
resistance from the government or the medical establishment.
 &HT;    In contrast, over the same period, enormous energy and resources
were expended to fight a war against poorly understood diseases
like cancer. While this effort was obviously very important, it
leads to an inevitable question: If a similarly aggressive war had
been declared on smoking, a killer whose cure is much more
straightforward (medically, if not politically), how many more
lives might have been saved?
 &HT;    In the final analysis, shouldn't conquering the tobacco lobby
have been easier than conquering cancer? And if so, have we missed
a grand opportunity?

   MEDICAL-ADVOCATE (San Francisco) _ If you are even thinking
about getting sick, don't! Due to the demands and limits set up

button, you get care. If not, you wait, you wait, you wait and you
wait. Just getting in to see your primary care physician (a.k.a.
doctor) is difficult. And if you need to see a specialist, don't
think you can just make an appointment. By RUTH SHERMAN.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: The Yogi Berra principle
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The care and custody of freedom of speech seems to depend these
days on whose freedom you're talking about. Mine is inviolable.
Yours is probationary.
</P>
<P>
   Recent surveys show people like freedom of speech very well _
for themselves. Multi-media moguls, newspaper publishers and movie
producers get meager public support. The Internet is a special
category. There, people are themselves the publishers. Internet
buffs are terrified of censorship.
</P>
<P>
   New York City is the latest _ no surprise _ battleground. A
federal judge has ruled that the city can't ban a rally because of
the sure prospect of hate speech. Even hate speech, the judge said,
gets First Amendment protection. The judge is wrong. Hate speech is
just about the only speech needing protection. Something is always
hateful to someone.
</P>
<P>
   A calendar over my desk quotes President Woodrow Wilson: ``The
wisest thing to do with a fool is to encourage him to hire a hall
and discourse to his fellow citizens. Nothing chills nonsense like
exposure to the air.''
</P>
<P>
   The same calendar also quotes Yogi Berra: ``You can observe a
lot by watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Thought I'd throw that in.

 &HT;    Some books worth reading during dog days
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ Summer is nearly gone, and none too soon
for those of us who live behind the Pine Curtain, where the
temperature and humidity each vie for hitting the century mark in a
hellish monotony that can't leave soon enough to suit all but the
most thin-blooded residents.
</P>
<P>
   There's not much to do about the weather except whine about it.
Best to find a cool spot _ either in the air conditioning or
outside as the sun finally sets and the ceiling fan provides enough
of a breeze to make it tolerable _ and settle down with a good
book. Here are a few that helped me get through the dog days of
August:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Children'' by David Halberstam (Random House, 783 pp.,
$29.95). This is not a book one can comfortably read while lounging
on the beach. It's too danged heavy, for one thing. But Halberstam,
one of our best popular historians, does a masterful job of
recounting the sit-ins of the 1960s that energized the nascent
civil rights movement. At the time, Halberstam worked for The
Nashville Tennessean, one of the rare Southern newspapers that
spoke out against segregation and Jim Crow laws.
</P>
<P>
   What struck me about these young men and women was their courage
in the face of unspeakable brutality. They endured beatings,
arrests and innumerable dignities to ultimately win the right to
eat at the same lunch counters as whites at stores that were more
than happy to take their money while shopping, to vote, and to be
paid comparable wages for comparable work.
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam manages to capture the spirit of those heady times
and to tell readers what happened to these ``children,'' as he
calls these teen-agers who adopted the nonviolent credo of Mahatma
Ghandi to change our society. I found ``The Children'' nearly
impossible to put down.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Blue Light'' by Walter Mosely. (Little, Brown &AMP; Co., 296
pp., $24). Mosely made a name for himself with his Easy Rawlins
series, featuring a black man in the 1950s who, though not a
detective per se, finds himself solving crimes. The Rawlins series
captures Los Angeles and Texas during the Eisenhower era. A few of
his books _ ``Devil in a Blue Dress'' _ for example, have been made
into films.
</P>
<P>
   Now Mosely has tried his hand at science fiction in a radical
departure. Those of us who love the Rawlins series might find
themselves a bit disconcerted at ``Blue Light,'' which is a booger
book of sorts, to steal a term a fellow book reviewer uses to
describe books that make him nervous. Like books by Stephen King or
Dean Koontz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue Light'' is tough to read but ultimately worth the effort,
though I had my doubts for a while. Still and all, I'm looking
forward to the next Easy Rawlins adventure.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Billy Straight'' by Jonathan Kellerman. (Random House, 467
pp. $25.95). One of my great delights is discovering an author who
has cranked out a bevy of books, none of which I've read. Such is
the case with Kellerman, who I've heard of but never read until
trying ``Billy Straight.'' This is one to take to the beach, though
you risk getting a sunburn while turning pages, since it's hard to
put down. The two main characters are the 12-year-old namesake of
the title, a winsome runaway who witnessed a woman being stabbed to
death. The murder is being investigated by Petra Connor, a tough
L.A. homicide detective whose heart goes out to young Billy. Chief
suspects are the TV actor ex-husband, his misogynist manager, and a
few other characters thrown in for good measure. Kellerman in the
jacket blurbs is called a master of the psychological thriller.
Certainly he's of a rank with Austin writer David Lindsey. I'm
looking forward to hitting the library soon to check out earlier
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, here's a delightfully trashy paperback: ``Breach of
Promise'' by Perri O'Shaughnessy, a non de plume used by two
sisters. The main character is a female attorney/single mother
named Nina Reilley who lives in glitzy Lake Tahoe. If you're stuck
in an airport and hope to drown out the incessant loudspeaker
announcing flights and messages, you could do worse than ``Breach
of Promise.'' The plot centers around a palimony case with Ms.
Reilley representing a woman who, it turns out, isn't legally
married. When her ``husband'' takes up with the secretary, she's
tossed out of the multi-million dollar spa business that she had a
key part in building.
</P>
<P>
   OK, it's better than it sounds, especially if you've ever spent
any time in Tahoe, which is a beautiful place even if
over-populated by people with more money than sense. No Pulitzer
Prizes for fiction here, but it's not a bad way to while away the
time while in an airport terminal, which is exactly what I did.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoy, and be patient. Cooler weather will come, eventually. You
have to believe that.

   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ ANGELINA COUNTY, Texas _ A nice lady phoned
the other day, concerned about the fate of the Lost in the '50s
Roadhouse, which is threatened by the new interstate. A fellow I
know just up the highway, whose home is so close to the bridge that
he figures to lose his property regardless of which way things go,
has been keeping in touch with the highway department as close as

   WOOTEN-COLUMN _ The most mystifying story extant in the Dog Days
of summer _ that Texas Gov. George W. Bush used cocaine _ is
without source or substance. So far as anybody can tell, its origin
is the rumor mill and its engine is political opponents goading
news-starved reporters to report the rumors. And now this
bewildering episode is carried to new levels. Democratic activist
Jesse Jackson has a policy proposal. The widely reported rumor
presents an opportunity for the nation to change its ``extreme''
anti-drug policies. (Wooten, Atlanta Journal)

<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ During the course of a week, I get a lot of
advice. Some of it is very good, some of it is horrible and most of
it falls somewhere in between.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an e-mail submission I received that offers up some good
advice from a Texas point of view. And keep in mind that no
self-respectin' Texan pronounces the ``g'' in ``ing-endin''' words.
</P>
<P>
   _ Good judgment comes from experience, and a lot of that comes
from bad judgment.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lettin' the cat outta the bag is a whole lot easier 'n puttin'
it back in.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you're ridin' ahead of the herd, take a look back every now
and then to make sure it's still there.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you get to thinkin' you're a person of some influence, try
orderin' somebody else's dog around.
</P>
<P>
   _ After eating an entire bull, a mountain lion felt so good he
started roaring. He kept it up until a hunter came along and shot
him. The moral: When you're full of bull, keep your mouth shut.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never kick a cow chip on a hot day.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't squat with your spurs on.
</P>
<P>
   _ There's two theories to arguin' with a woman. Neither one
works.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is stop
diggin'.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never slap a man who's chewin' tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   _ It don't take a genius to spot a goat in a flock of sheep.
</P>
<P>
   _ Always drink upstream from the herd.
</P>
<P>
   _ When you give a lesson in meanness to a critter or a person,
don't be surprised if they learn their lesson.
</P>
<P>
   _ When you're throwin' your weight around, be ready to have it
thrown around by somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   _ The quickest way to double your money is to fold it over and
put it back in your pocket.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never miss a good chance to shut up.
</P>
<P>
   _ There are three kinds of men: The one that learns by reading.
The few who learn by observation. And the rest of them have to
touch the electric fence for themselves.

Brazil focuses on Ouro Preto. The gold mining town in a storybook
mountain setting is a U.N. world heritage site, with one of the

performance. The songs here are much more experimental and
introspective, sparsely produced and virtually country-free. Also,
new releases from Richard Thompson and the compilation
``Violator.'' (Staff, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) Art includes
18-pica color photo of Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris.

   MARLON _ ATLANTA _ Is there life after the Jackson 5? Michael's
older, less flamboyant brother Marlon thinks so. He's putting his
money and show business experience behind the Major Broadcasting
Company, an Atlanta-based cable television network. Working with
investors and fellow celebrities such as Evander Holyfield and
Cecil Fielder, Jackson hopes to offer family-oriented programming
with religious and secular themes. Although the upstart network is
only available to satellite customers in Atlanta, MBC is in
negotiations to be picked up by local cable providers. We spoke
with Marlon about his new business venture, his family, and a
possible J5 reunion. (Harris, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH

   COXNET TRAVEL 0831 -- I'm standing atop Half Dome, a sheer
granite cliff soaring impressively above this awesome park. I can
think of nothing but throwing up. My brother convinced me I could
stop along the way and read if I got tired. It was an empty
promise. It's the type of lie in which both parties consent, for
motivational purposes. (Bierman, Palm Beach Post) Art includes

   TRAVEL-BRAZIL _ Part II of Wendell Brock's travel series on
Brazil focuses on Ouro Preto. The gold mining town in a storybook
mountain setting is a U.N. world heritage site, with one of the
world's richest deposits of gold-encrusted Baroque architecture.
The region of Minas Gerais also has a vibrant, African-inflected
culinary tradition that parallels that of the American South, with
collards, corn meal and pork in wild abundance. A colorful scene
piece with nice photographs and a complete guide to the markets,
shops, restaurants and hotels. (Brock, Atlanta

   TRAVEL-ROCKWELL _ In his famous song, ``Alice's Restaurant,''
Arlo Guthrie immortalized a hole-in-the wall restaurant in
Stockbridge, Mass. But the refrain applies to all of the

art museums to antique silver, all in the idyllic surroundings of
manicured, small-town New England towns set like gems in a ring of
verdant hills. (Fox, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

 &HT;    Aquarian teens share wheels, walls, peanut butter and whatnot
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Recently the high schooler in our house, who wants
to write music, went into a creative sensory-purge mode. He pushed
every musical instrument he owned out the front door _ guitars,
amp, stereo, keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   It's OK. They're with family.
</P>
<P>
   Those who will keep the instruments until his muse summons a
return are members of the Couch-Peace Commune.
</P>
<P>
   The Couch-Peace Commune is a mobile, docile community of
16-year-olds. They have expanded on the concept of the nuclear
family. Each of their families remains nuclear, but their homes _
our homes _ serve as communal pads. In the process the attached
families become extended kin.
</P>
<P>
   Couch-Peace Commune has no walls except those of cells that
serve such purposes as homework and sleep. Otherwise, when as a
family, Couch-Peace moves as a group. In cell terms, the commune is
a protoplasm the size of a midsize Texas town.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, members are mobile. But true to their name, they also have
inert stages. The Couch-Peace group will spend long hours on any
given couch, coexisting in peace. Sometimes they will sit in a row.
Sometimes they will be draped over each other. Occasionally one
member will be positioned with feet slung over the back of the
couch, head toward the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Other times they will be spread along the floor like just-fed
lions, yawning.
</P>
<P>
   The feeding of the Couch-Peacers is a zoological marvel.
</P>
<P>
   They are comfortable with any refrigerator in any house in the
commune. No cupboard is alien to them. They operate under the
proven principle that anything that comes from someone else's home
tastes better _ be it white bread, stale peanut butter, month-old
frankfurters _ anything.
</P>
<P>
   Within a biome, they serve a certain ecosystem function, which
is to never let anything stay in the fridge too long.
</P>
<P>
   The Couch-Peace Commune came into being this summer with freedom
and newfound driving privileges.
</P>
<P>
   The friends had spent a lot of time together before. Now, being
auto-mobile, they became a commune, not in a '60s, back-to-the-farm
sense, but in a '90s, ``We'll be over at (fill-in-a-blank)'s
house'' sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are you going?'' we ask the commune.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Jeff's for a while, and Suncy's, and Keith's.''
</P>
<P>
   As a commune, they are a physics quandary: always in motion, yet
going nowhere in particular; always somewhere, just no place in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   The new school year has altered this pattern, at least during
weekdays, but not completely.
</P>
<P>
   Because as juniors they have open-campus lunch opportunities,
they have experimented with communal dining rather than whatever
experiment the cafeteria is serving.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did you have for lunch today?'' I ask my son.
</P>
<P>
   (Day 1) ``Peanut butter and jelly at Natalie's.''
</P>
<P>
   (Day 2) ``Taco Bell at Jenny's.''
</P>
<P>
   (Day 3) ``Cold pizza and grapes at Kevin's.''
</P>
<P>
   (Day 4) ``Peanut butter and jelly and milk and crackers at
Keith's.''
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, not all of these names I associate with Couch-Peace,
but hey, it's a mobile society.
</P>
<P>
   He describes these meals with relish. It's the old Seinfeld
thing. Dining is not just food, it's convening.
</P>
<P>
   As for the other types of sharing generally associated with '60s
commune life, we exert '50s controls. Regardless of where they're
communing, members of Couch-Peace return to their cells at or
before a designated hour.
</P>
<P>
   As for the musical instruments expelled from our home, an
acoustic guitar returned the other night signalling the beginning
of the end of the creative purge. An electric, an amp, a stereo and
a keyboard are still out somewhere. I trust they will be kept in
the family.

   ERNESTMURRAY-COLUMN _ LUFKIN, Texas _ During the course of a
week, I get a lot of advice. Some of it is very good, some of it is
horrible and most of it falls somewhere in between. Here's an
e-mail submission I received that offers up some good advice from a
Texas point of view. And keep in mind that no self-respectin' Texan
pronounces the ``g'' in ``ing-endin''' words. (Ernest Murray is

Mine is inviolable. Yours is probationary. (Rosenfeld, Cox News

   BORDERS-COLUMN _ There's not much to do about the weather except
whine about it. Best to find a cool spot _ either in the air

Borders is editor and publisher of the Nacogdoches Daily Sentinel.)

   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ ANGELINA COUNTY, Texas _ A nice lady phoned
the other day, concerned about the fate of the Lost in the '50s
Roadhouse, which is threatened by the new interstate. A fellow I
know just up the highway, whose home is so close to the bridge that
he figures to lose his property regardless of which way things go,
has been keeping in touch with the highway department as close as
most anybody. And he says without a doubt the roadhouse will

   WOOTEN-COLUMN _ The most mystifying story extant in the Dog Days
of summer _ that Texas Gov. George W. Bush used cocaine _ is
without source or substance. So far as anybody can tell, its origin
is the rumor mill and its engine is political opponents goading
news-starved reporters to report the rumors. And now this
bewildering episode is carried to new levels. Democratic activist
Jesse Jackson has a policy proposal. The widely reported rumor
presents an opportunity for the nation to change its ``extreme''
anti-drug policies. (Wooten, Atlanta Journal)

</P>
<P>
   Most news stories --particularly those involving religion --have
a short shelf life. But six years after the fact, Waco is still
news.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the FBI hinted at what many have speculated: they may
not have been as innocent in the 1993 siege of the Branch Davidian
compound as we were led to believe.
</P>
<P>
   The Branch Davidians, founded in 1934, is a sectarian group of
the Seventh Day Adventist Church. In 1987, David Koresh became one
of their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Davidians believed themselves to be a separate spiritual
nation headed by a prophet. They expected the imminent return of
Christ. Their special status, as forerunners of the Second Coming,
created tension with the surrounding society.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Davidians identified the United States as
``apostate.'' They anticipated a violent confrontation between
themselves and the evil powers.
</P>
<P>
   The government depicted Koresh and the Branch Davidians as a
dangerous ``cult'' akin to Jim Jones and the People's Temple.
Koresh was stockpiling weapons and, most damning, abusing children.
If not stopped, they would commit mass suicide or attack the
surrounding community. Thus, Koresh's religion justified the
government's siege of the compound.
</P>
<P>
   What is odd about the scenario is not Koresh's religion. What is
odd and deeply troublingis what the government did about that
religion.
</P>
<P>
   Koresh and his followers were Christians. They certainly were
not Presbyterians or Baptists, but they believed everything more
mainstream Christians do. And like other Christians do, they
embellished parts of the tradition. The Branch Davidians emphasized
the Book of Revelation, separating themselves from the sinful world
as distinct people. Koresh was their prophet (not a new Messiah)
who helped them interpret scripture and prepare them for their
destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Among their more particular beliefs were that Koresh needed to
father 24 children and that the government would one day attack
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Branch Davidians are best understood as a nonconventional
religion. Such religions are generally the offspring of more
traditional groups. They tend to overemphasize some part of the
tradition, thus creating a ``super pious'' group within the older
institution. Eventually the tension causes them to form a new
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout American history, nonconventional groups have spun
off of nearly every mainstream religion. But Protestantism has been
especially susceptible to the process. And the line between
``mainstream'' and ``nonconventional'' has often been thin.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1830s, for example, Presbyterian minister Charles Finney
led a spectacular series of revivals that resulted in hundreds of
thousands of conversions. Finney's manipulative methods often
produced unusual manifestations such as instantaneous healing and
tongues speaking. Although controversial in his practices, Finney
stayed on this side of the theological law and never significantly
deviated from traditional Protestant doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   One of Finney's followers, John Humphrey Noyes, however,
modified both Christian practice and theology. Noyes believed that
Jesus' Second Coming had already occurred and that Christians had
achieved sinless perfection. Noyes instituted ``biblical
communism'' among his followersincluding the practice of ``complex
marriage'', where everyone in his commune was married to everyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   The group, known as the Oneida Community, survived for almost 50
years. They experienced legal persecution (Noyes was indicted on
adultery charges) and informal persecution from neighboring
Christians. But they carried out their religious experiment in
relative peace.
</P>
<P>
   Other 19th-century groups could tell similar stories.
</P>
<P>
   Nonconventional religions, like the Mormons and Shakers, were
often construed as dangerous especially regarding sex and violence.
</P>
<P>
   America's valued ``religious freedom'' only grudgingly welcomed
non-mainstream, non-Protestant religions. Even Roman Catholics and
Jews were persecuted. But violence against them was generally
sporadic, local, and not directed by a government agency.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the difference with Waco. David Koresh did exactly
what hundreds of American religious leaders had done before him.
For nearly four centuries, Americans have embellished upon
theological traditions, experimented with marriage and
childbearing, formed isolated communes, started new religions, kept
firearms to insure their safety, and challenged political and
cultural norms. At least theoretically, the government protected
the right to do so.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot defend Koresh theologically. I think he and his
followers were tragically wrong. But unless they were breaking the
law--and it is not altogether clear they were -- the Davidians'
religious rights should have protected them from a military assault
on distasteful theology.
</P>
<P>
   One need not be a paranoid anti-government fanatic to think
something went terribly wrong at Waco. Government agents shouldn't
throw bombs (i.e. ``pyrotechnic canisters'') on churchesespecially
with children inside.
</P>
<P>
   If the line between mainstream and nonconventional is indeed
thin, Presbyterians and Baptists -- indeed those of all faiths
--must remember Waco.

 &HT;    CHINA'S ANNIVERSARY FACELIFT INVOKES PRIDE, GRIPES IN BEIJING
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    For Use Sat., Sept. 4 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The late Chairman Mao Tse-tung must be weeping in his
mausoleum: a glitzy shopping district is a showstopping centerpiece
for the 50th anniversary of China's Communist revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The district is one of 67 projects, including a new subway line
and airport terminal, under construction around the clock to be
finished in time for the Oct. 1 festivities here. But among the
more than $13 billion in capital improvements, the Wangfujing
Street renovation most audaciously flaunts just how dramatically
New China has altered its course in five decades.
</P>
<P>
   Rolex watches and Burberry coats are for sale there, and parts
of the street are paved in pink marble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows the prosperity of the country,'' said Zhong Di, 73,
contentedly surveying the scene with her husband from one of the
street's new wooden benches. ``Without money, we couldn't make so
many changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet an undercurrent of discontent also can be found in Beijing
among people who question the lavish expenditures and disruption
radiating from messy construction sites for more than a year,
people who wonder if things are moving in quite the right direction
as New China completes its first half century with a continuing
charge into capitalist-style reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had money I could get cosmetics and surgery and I'd look
like I was 30 years old, too,'' scoffed a 56-year-old pedicab
driver who identified himself only as Mr. Wu. ``How you look isn't
as important as what you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Money would be better spent helping Chinese who are laid off,
live in substandard housing, or don't have enough to eat, he said,
as three fellow drivers murmured assent.
</P>
<P>
   Big construction projects have multiple aims _ to improve life
here, to make Chinese feel proud, and to show a modern, sleek face
to the rest of the world as it tunes into the milestone
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Negative commentary isn't rare, but seldom is openly mouthed as
the anniversary nears and the volume of patriotic boosterism blares
ever louder in the media, schools and work units.
</P>
<P>
   And plenty of Beijingers do sound happy to see the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we don't spend this money now, we will have to spend
it later. If we want Beijing to be an international city we have to
spend a lot of money,'' said Qiao Wei, a 20-year-old law student.
</P>
<P>
   Among improvements, the new subway line is her personal
favorite. Cleaning the foul canals and dotting green space all over
town also enhance the quality of living in China's capital.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Wangfujing Street for massive renovation is a
more intriguing decision to ponder.
</P>
<P>
   The name derives from Ming dynasty days, when an emperor
reputedly demanded that his 10 brothers live together near the
Forbidden City for easy surveillance. The street became known as
Shiwangfu, or street of mansions for 10 brothers.
</P>
<P>
   In the century before the revolution it was called Morrison
Street and was a premier shopping district. Post-revolution, it
re-acquired the Chinese name _ adding ``jing'' for an ancient well
there _ and got a new attitude. Shops became state-owned and the
half-mile-long street was anchored with the first peoples'
department store, where plain and basic were orders of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Now shabbier stores are being replaced and storefronts are
getting spiffy new facades and signs. Jewelry stores, camera shops,
and a new fur and leather emporium will compete with more modest
dress and underwear stores.
</P>
<P>
   The street itself has been reconfigured into mainly a pedestrian
mall, with only buses and a few permitted vehicles allowed to drive
through.
</P>
<P>
   Flowering planters made from wooden barrels and carts enliven
the tree-lined walkway, and plazas with irregularly-timed water
jets draw giggling children trying to dodge the sprays.
</P>
<P>
   The change is remarkable to people like the elderly Zhong.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days Beijing had only a lot of single-story houses.
People's clothes were only in three colors--black, gray and
blue--nothing else,'' she said. ``It was a very simple life.''
</P>
<P>
   This focus on consumption is polar opposite the principles that
undergirded Chairman Mao's revolution. And consumption isn't so
popular today, either.
</P>
<P>
   Zhong and her husband are an example.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't come downtown to shop today, just to see the
changes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The reopening of the refurbished Beijing Department Store drew
400,000 people last weekend, but many came just to gawk or to buy
tea or trinkets.
</P>
<P>
   Most people strolling down Wangfujing aren't burdened with
packages, a sign of the nationwide angst brought on by dislocations
from economic reform policies. An estimated 8 percent to 10 percent
of the urban work force is unemployed, and layoffs ripple
throughout the country as unprofitable, inefficient state
enterprises fold under competitive pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The state has scaled back long-time communist benefits like
heavily subsidized housing as it moves to free the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Demand has been so slack that retail prices have gone down for
22 months in a row, leaving stores and factories with bulging
inventories.
</P>
<P>
   Pedicab driver Wu said Chinese won't even buy rides in his buggy
these days. Himself forced into early retirement from a clothing
factory a few years ago, Wu pedals Beijing's streets to make enough
money for his family.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to understand his bitterness at the expensive, gala
festivities planned for October.
</P>
<P>
   But the fireworks and parades and newly-finished public works
will likely stir pride and optimism deep in the souls of many
Chinese, especially if they consider the long, austere and often
torturous road they have been forced to negotiate over the past 50
years. That, at least, appears be the hope of Chinese leaders
stage-managing the party.

OF SAXONY'

<P>
   DRESDEN _ On a plain a few miles north of this old and storied
city, the futures of two unlikely partners are joined in an
ambitious and expensive gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Rising from transformed farmland is an expansive new factory
with a simple contemporary design that would fit in nicely at any
American industrial park.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Fab 30, the plant was built by Advanced Micro Devices
Inc. (AMD) for about $1.9 billion and bears a distinct resemblance
to its Austin, Texas sister, Fab 25.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes as planned, Fab 30 by the end of the year will begin
yielding its primary and perhaps only product: the cutting edge,
copper-based Athlon microprocessor chip, formerly known as K-7.
</P>
<P>
   Athlon is AMD's rock in the sling for its challenge of
Austin-based Intel Corp., the Goliath of chip makers.
</P>
<P>
   As important as Athlon's success is to California-based AMD, it
means as much or more to government and business leaders in this
region as they strive to find a future after spending 50 of its
last 60 years ruled by either the Nazis or Communists.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the fall of the Berlin wall, Dresden, which was left
in ruins after World War II, began to aggressively pursue high-tech
companies such as AMD to build what leaders here like to call the
``Silicon Valley of Saxony.''
</P>
<P>
   To entice AMD, the state of Saxony offered about $500 million _
an offering AMD executives agree was essential to their decision to
locate in Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the city of Dresden assembled the 110-acre parcel
near the city's international airport and provided infrastructure _
including a direct link to the Autobahn that connects Dresden to
Berlin and Leipzig. The city sold the land to the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We helped AMD do everything,'' said Helmut Ennen, the state
official who in 1993 approached the company's chief executive Jerry
Sanders about coming to Dresden. ``But the decision was theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Landing AMD was a stunning victory for Dresden, keeping the
momentum going and contributing to the critical mass needed to
attract other companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 5,000 people are directly employed in the high-tech
businesses here, and we estimate that that produces jobs for
another 15,000 people,'' Ennen said. ``This has been very important
and gratifying for us.''
</P>
<P>
   AMD intends to hire 1,800 people, about half of whom already
work at Fab 30. All but about 30 are expected to be German, mostly
from Saxony.
</P>
<P>
   AMD was the second large technology firm to select Dresden,
following Siemens _ now Infineon Technolgies _ by a year. Last
year, the company announced a joint venture with Motorola to build
a plant in Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   In April Mattson Technology, a fast-growing California firm,
chose Dresden as its research and development hub for Europe. In
all, 420 technology companies and 2,000 suppliers have set up in
and around the city.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, AMD has been impressed by its experience here, said
Gary Heerssen, group vice president of AMD's Wafer Fab Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is an experiment then you would have to label it a
successful experiment to date,'' Heerssen said during an interview
with Cox Newspapers in a sparsely outfitted office at Fab 30.
</P>
<P>
   Heerssen is minding the store until James Doran, Fab 30's new
general manager, arrives later this year. Doran, who managed
Austin's Fab 25, replaced Jack Saltich, who resigned in July to
work for another company.
</P>
<P>
   Heerssen said he has been impressed by the early tests of Fab
30's precision equipment _ some of its components are so new that
they are in use for the first time. On July 7, the Fab 30 plant
successfully created its first copper-based chips, the first to be
produced in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to tell, but so far I think the indications are
quite good'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $500 million gift from the state, AMD was
attracted to Saxony because of its supply of well-educated and
under-employed workers. About a quarter of AMD's new hires here
were unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Even though labor costs are higher than in Austin, the quality
of the workers make up the difference, Heerssen said. ``In general,
the overall educational level here on the part of the employee base
is higher than it is in central Texas, and probably everywhere
else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, it has proved to be an unusually flexible
workforce for Europe, where governments tend to limit the hours
people can be on the job. At AMD, many employees work 12-hour
shifts and the plant is staffed 24 hours a day _ unheard of
elsewhere in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The company and local officials speculate that this could be
explained by Saxony's being fairly new to the free-market system.
This means that structures such as trade unions and bureaucracies
that are prevalent in much of Europe have not yet taken hold in
this somewhat isolated region. Union membership in the former East
Germany has fallen by 50 percent since 1991, and only about 25
percent of workers in the region are under collective-bargaining
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Also remarkable for Europe, local politicians have shown little
fondness for red tape that has stymied investment in other eastern
regions, such as Berlin. ``We haven't lost one day of this project
to bureaucratic obstructions,'' said Jens Drews, AMD's spokesman in
Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, local officials two years ago came up with about
$1.5 million to establish an English-speaking international school
for the ``chip kids'' who came with AMD's 30 American employees.
The school has grown with the demand from other expatriate
families.
</P>
<P>
   For the Americans here, moving to Dresden has been an enriching
experience. Michael Ashley, a Californian who also maintains an
office in Austin, said he tries to visit one country a month.
``It's been a great experience for me,'' he said, noting that his
first visit to Europe was a house-hunting expedition to Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans at the Fab, many of whom have been to Texas for
training, have been exposed to a strange new culture. They address
fellow workers and superiors by their first names _ a rare
informality in Germany _ and have become accustomed to casual
Fridays when they wear jeans to the office. On a few desks are
Texas flags and in the hallways are framed photographs of their
favorite watering holes in Texas and scenes of hill country vistas.
</P>
<P>
   Heerssen said the company thought briefly about expanding in
Texas before deciding on Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear that the company needed a second Fab, but to remain
in Austin would have required the acquisition of a new site and a
willingness to cope with a very tight labor market, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the incentives offered in Dresden proved decisive.
``It goes back to the financial arrangement that was available here
that would not have been available in Austin,'' he said. ``That was
the enabling factor but not the only reason.''
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, Austin is expected to continue producing

OF SAXONY'

   DRESDEN _ On a plain a few miles north of this old and storied
city, the futures of two unlikely partners are joined in an
ambitious and expensive gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Rising from transformed farmland is an expansive new factory
with a simple contemporary design that would fit in nicely at any
American industrial park.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Fab 30, the plant was built by Advanced Micro Devices
Inc. (AMD) for about $1.9 billion and bears a distinct resemblance
to its Austin, Texas sister, Fab 25.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes as planned, Fab 30 by the end of the year will begin
yielding its primary and perhaps only product: the cutting edge,
copper-based Athlon microprocessor chip, formerly known as K-7.
</P>
<P>
   Athlon is AMD's rock in the sling for its challenge of
Austin-based Intel Corp., the Goliath of chip makers.
</P>
<P>
   As important as Athlon's success is to California-based AMD, it
means as much or more to government and business leaders in this
region as they strive to find a future after spending 50 of its
last 60 years ruled by either the Nazis or Communists.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the fall of the Berlin wall, Dresden, which was left
in ruins after World War II, began to aggressively pursue high-tech
companies such as AMD to build what leaders here like to call the
``Silicon Valley of Saxony.''
</P>
<P>
   To entice AMD, the state of Saxony offered about $500 million _
an offering AMD executives agree was essential to their decision to
locate in Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the city of Dresden assembled the 110-acre parcel
near the city's international airport and provided infrastructure _
including a direct link to the Autobahn that connects Dresden to
Berlin and Leipzig. The city sold the land to the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We helped AMD do everything,'' said Helmut Ennen, the state
official who in 1993 approached the company's chief executive Jerry
Sanders about coming to Dresden. ``But the decision was theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Landing AMD was a stunning victory for Dresden, keeping the
momentum going and contributing to the critical mass needed to
attract other companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 5,000 people are directly employed in the high-tech
businesses here, and we estimate that that produces jobs for
another 15,000 people,'' Ennen said. ``This has been very important
and gratifying for us.''
</P>
<P>
   AMD intends to hire 1,800 people, about half of whom already
work at Fab 30. All but about 30 are expected to be German, mostly
from Saxony.
</P>
<P>
   AMD was the second large technology firm to select Dresden,
following Siemens _ now Infineon Technolgies _ by a year. Last
year, the company announced a joint venture with Motorola to build
a plant in Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   In April Mattson Technology, a fast-growing California firm,
chose Dresden as its research and development hub for Europe. In
all, 420 technology companies and 2,000 suppliers have set up in
and around the city.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, AMD has been impressed by its experience here, said
Gary Heerssen, group vice president of AMD's Wafer Fab Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is an experiment then you would have to label it a
successful experiment to date,'' Heerssen said during an interview
with Cox Newspapers in a sparsely outfitted office at Fab 30.
</P>
<P>
   Heerssen is minding the store until James Doran, Fab 30's new
general manager, arrives later this year. Doran, who managed
Austin's Fab 25, replaced Jack Saltich, who resigned in July to
work for another company.
</P>
<P>
   Heerssen said he has been impressed by the early tests of Fab
30's precision equipment _ some of its components are so new that
they are in use for the first time. On July 7, the Fab 30 plant
successfully created its first copper-based chips, the first to be
produced in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to tell, but so far I think the indications are
quite good'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $500 million gift from the state, AMD was
attracted to Saxony because of its supply of well-educated and
under-employed workers. About a quarter of AMD's new hires here
were unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Even though labor costs are higher than in Austin, the quality
of the workers make up the difference, Heerssen said. ``In general,
the overall educational level here on the part of the employee base
is higher than it is in central Texas, and probably everywhere
else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, it has proved to be an unusually flexible
workforce for Europe, where governments tend to limit the hours
people can be on the job. At AMD, many employees work 12-hour
shifts and the plant is staffed 24 hours a day _ unheard of
elsewhere in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The company and local officials speculate that this could be
explained by Saxony's being fairly new to the free-market system.
This means that structures such as trade unions and bureaucracies
that are prevalent in much of Europe have not yet taken hold in
this somewhat isolated region. Union membership in the former East
Germany has fallen by 50 percent since 1991, and only about 25
percent of workers in the region are under collective-bargaining
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Also remarkable for Europe, local politicians have shown little
fondness for red tape that has stymied investment in other eastern
regions, such as Berlin. ``We haven't lost one day of this project
to bureaucratic obstructions,'' said Jens Drews, AMD's spokesman in
Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, local officials two years ago came up with about
$1.5 million to establish an English-speaking international school
for the ``chip kids'' who came with AMD's 30 American employees.
The school has grown with the demand from other expatriate
families.
</P>
<P>
   For the Americans here, moving to Dresden has been an enriching
experience. Michael Ashley, a Californian who also maintains an
office in Austin, said he tries to visit one country a month.
``It's been a great experience for me,'' he said, noting that his
first visit to Europe was a house-hunting expedition to Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans at the Fab, many of whom have been to Texas for
training, have been exposed to a strange new culture. They address
fellow workers and superiors by their first names _ a rare
informality in Germany _ and have become accustomed to casual
Fridays when they wear jeans to the office. On a few desks are
Texas flags and in the hallways are framed photographs of their
favorite watering holes in Texas and scenes of hill country vistas.
</P>
<P>
   Heerssen said the company thought briefly about expanding in
Texas before deciding on Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear that the company needed a second Fab, but to remain
in Austin would have required the acquisition of a new site and a
willingness to cope with a very tight labor market, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the incentives offered in Dresden proved decisive.
``It goes back to the financial arrangement that was available here
that would not have been available in Austin,'' he said. ``That was
the enabling factor but not the only reason.''
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, Austin is expected to continue producing
aluminum-based microprocessors for the mid- and low-end of the
market _ where the volumes are higher _ while Dresden will produce
the high-performance products.
</P>
<P>
   If the Dresden experiment continues to be successful and
business is good, AMD is prepared to expand here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The site is actually large enough for two, maybe three fabs,''
Heerssen said. ``But we have not made any plans at this point _
hard plans _ to expand beyond the existing facility.''
</P>
<P>
   For Dresden leaders, who are hot after other prospects, the AMD
experiment confirmed their belief in a way of thinking that runs
deeper in the city than its calamitous 20th Century experiences.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 years ago, Augustus the Strong _ perhaps the greatest

king, Friedrich of Prussia.

 &HT;    ARMY TROOPS, REBELS AND ANTI-REBEL VIGILANTES MAKE VOLATILE MIX
IN MEXICO'S CHIAPAS STATE
 &HT;    EDs: For purposes of a locator map, La Realidad is about 100
miles southeast of San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas state, and
about 50 miles east of Las Margaritas, Chiapas.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Sept. 5 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA REALIDAD, Mexico _ Armed with machetes, the men came out of
the darkness and swarmed the truck ferrying Mexican doctor Lydia
Rangel and two Spaniards out of the Lacandon jungle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tie them up!'' some of the vigilantes shouted, accusing the
three of being ``outside agitators'' and leaders of Mexico's
Zapatista rebels.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 yards down the isolated dirt road, Mexican Army
soldiers charged with keeping the peace in this volatile region in
Mexico's southern state of Chiapas surely heard screams, according
to Rangel. Yet they failed to rescue the terrified captives. In
fact, Rangel is certain one of the soldiers was among the mob,
which Rangel says tried to rape her and appeared close to lynching
all three captives on Aug. 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was with sheer complicity of the military,'' said the
24-year-old newly graduated physician from Mexico City, who has
requested a criminal investigation into the attack near a hamlet
called El Eden. She showed dark bruises on her legs and described
how the assailants tried to tear off her clothing before they
suddenly released her and the Spaniards.
</P>
<P>
   The chilling incident near this remote Zapatista rebel
stronghold is fueling fear that vigilantes loyal to Mexico's ruling
party are on the rise here, a year and a half after 45 people,
mostly women and young children, were massacred by similar
anti-Zapatista vigilantes in the village of Acteal.
</P>
<P>
   Although the military was not implicated in the Acteal massacre,
human rights groups accuse some soldiers of tolerating or even
assisting violent anti-rebel groups in spite of a truce and a peace
accord with the Zapatistas, who first emerged in Chiapas state more
than five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Army has a tremendous responsibility for what's happening
here,'' said Marina Patricia Jimenez, director of the Fray
Bartolome Human Rights Center, a Catholic Church group in Chiapas
whose lawyer is representing Rangel.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican military did not respond to repeated requests by Cox
Newspapers to talk about the alleged attack on Rangel and the
Spaniards, or other recent violent confrontations involving
government troops in Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a number of violent clashes this month in
Chiapas, where the unresolved Zapatista rebellion remains a thorn
pricking at the Mexican government.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, politicians and business people who are
against the rebels have expressed outrage at foreigners who come to
Chiapas to visit communities as human rights observers or rebel
sympathizers. Now, that anger is widening to include Mexicans from
outside the state.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel, who volunteers in communities sympathetic to the
Zapatistas, said she and two Spaniards visiting villages here were
stopped at a makeshift roadblock by men claiming themselves to be
sympathizers, but of Mexico's ruling Revolutionary Institutional
Party, or the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   The men said that PRI supporters were putting up a roadblock to
stop Zapatistas because the rebels were preventing the construction
of roads and other development projects.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel also said a man stepped out from among a crowd that
swelled to about 150 people and said, ``Here the autonomy of the
PRI supersedes the law of the federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the crowd debated what to do with the three before
stealing some of their possessions, beating them and then letting
them go. Screaming, the three piled into their truck and pulled up
to the nearby military roadblock _ one of four along a 50-mile
stretch of road to La Realidad, the Zapatistas' reported jungle
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   A soldier Rangel recognized as a man among the mob said the Army
was watching the road and that the vehicle she was in had better
not stop or its occupants might be shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatistas first emerged in this remote part of Mexico when
they staged an armed uprising in Chiapas, Mexico's poorest state,
on New Year's Day 1994. Mostly Mayan Indians who speak limited
Spanish, they fought briefly with police and the military in
several cities in Chiapas before a truce was called and
negotiations began to address their demands for justice, Indian
autonomy and policies to overcome desperate poverty here.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 peace accords were signed between the rebels and
Mexico's federal government, which acknowledges that for decades it
has neglected the mostly agrarian Chiapas and failed to prevent
abuses committed against the state's large Mayan Indian population.
But the peace accord has never been fully implemented and talks
broke down between the government and the rebels, who enjoy empathy
if not active support from many Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels accuse President Ernesto Zedillo's administration of
breaking its promise to stick to the peace accords and opting for a
``low intensity'' war to erode support for the Zapatistas.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 22, 1997, divisions among Chiapas' population exploded
when pro-government Indians attacked the village of Acteal,
slaughtering 45 other Indians attending a prayer service. Police
officers in Chiapas were arrested for playing a role in the attack
and the governor of the state resigned under pressure from the
Zedillo administration. Thousands more Mexican Army troops were
sent into Chiapas, some of them ordered to offer medical services
and other humanitarian aid to rebel villages in an attempt to win
their confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican government also began deporting foreign tourists
from the United States and Europe who were flocking to rebel
villages as observers at the request of Mexican human rights
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In the last couple of weeks, government officials in Chiapas
have turned their wrath on Mexicans from out of town. Local PRI
officials and the mayor of San Cristobal de las Casas, a tourist
town in Chiapas, declared a Mexican actress ``persona non grata''
and publicly threatened to run her out of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``They simply don't want any observers going there,'' said
Mexico City television actress Ofelia Medina, who received ample
national publicity for being the object of scorn in Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   Medina sparked criticism in Chiapas by traveling to a remote
jungle hamlet, Amador Hernandez, where pro-Zapatista Indians were
preventing the construction of a road. Although Amador Hernandez is
a six-hour walk from the nearest dirt road, villagers said they
feared a new passageway for vehicles would be used primarily to
move more Army troops into the area and position them against the
Zapatistas.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians also said they had asked the government to build a
road more than 10 years ago _ before the conflict _ but they were
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   When Mexican troops were dispatched to Amador Hernandez to
provide security for construction teams, groups of masked women
blocked their path. Joining them were Medina, and students who have
been on strike for more than four months at Mexico's National
Autonomous University in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   The acting governor of Chiapas, Roberto Albores, lashed out at
the protestors, traveling to a different Indian village that has
expressed support for the road. He also urged federal officials to
``let Chiapas resolve its own conflict'' _ comments that were
interpreted by human rights organizations as inciting violence.
</P>
<P>
   Local newspapers also weighed in, publishing angry editorials
about Medina.
</P>
<P>
   After the Zapatistas mustered more than 10,000 supporters to
demonstrations Aug. 23-25 in three cities in Chiapas, the Zedillo
administration announced on Aug. 26 that the road to Amador
Hernandez would be postponed.
</P>
<P>
   That was one day after another incident flared up in the jungle.
The Army says villagers wielding sticks and machetes attacked
soldiers, wounding seven, patrolling in a village a two-hours walk
from the nearest road. Three villagers who were arrested said the
soldiers instigated the clash when they pushed women protesting
their presence and began firing their guns into the air. Two
villagers were shot and wounded.
</P>
<P>
   At the rebel headquarters here in La Realidad, Zapatistas say
they typically shut their doors when soldiers stationed about five
miles away drive through the hamlet on their way to another Army
outpost in the jungle. La Realidad is surrounded by a wall of
jungle and is about four hours from the nearest paved road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be that one day the soldiers will try to stop here,
too,'' said a rebel named Maximiliano Hernandez. ``If that happens,
then the people will have to defend themselves.''

 &HT;    FOR DIVIDED PUERTO RICANS, QUESTION OF STATEHOOD IS NOT A SIMPLE
ONE
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Sept. 5 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ The question dominates every political
conversation here, peppering the talk of old men sitting on shady
street corners, filling the radio airwaves, cropping up in news
articles on everything from politics to business and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Mainland Americans call it the ``statehood'' issue because they
think it's a simple question of whether Puerto Rico should become
the 51st state.
</P>
<P>
   For Puerto Ricans, boiling things down to a simple up-or-down
vote on statehood doesn't do justice to the complex mix of history,
culture, principles and emotions that most of this vibrant island's
residents bring to the discussion of what they call ``status.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to know what we want and what we want to be,'' said
Margie Morales, a veteran of the capital's political scene and
press secretary to San Juan's pro-commonwealth Mayor Sila Calderon,
who will carry her Popular Democratic Party's banner in the 2000
gubernatorial election. ``For us it's a major question that we face
every four years. It's a matter of identity. It's like whether or
not to get married.''
</P>
<P>
   The complexity of the issue was demonstrated recently when
two-term Gov. Pedro Rossello _ perhaps the most ardent statehood
advocate ever elected here _ appealed to a United Nations committee
to list Puerto Rico as one of the world's nonself-governing
territories whose status is to be determined by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The move caused a stir here, as Rossello flatly admitted he was
frustrated that the U.S. Congress seems unwilling to deal with the
Puerto Rican question. The U.N. panel passed a resolution urging
the United States to speed up its deliberations on the issue,
although the measure has no power to force the American Congress to
act.
</P>
<P>
   First elected in 1992, Rossello has made the statehood campaign
the centerpiece of his administration, pushing through island-wide
votes on the issue in 1993 and 1998. Neither vote, however,
produced the results he hoped for: in both cases, voters failed to
give a majority to the statehood option.
</P>
<P>
   But the tallies came tantalizingly close. In both plebiscites,
statehood garnered just over 46 percent of the total. More than 70
percent of the island's registered voters turned out in both
elections, a clear sign of just how intensely Puerto Rico's 3.8
million residents feel about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The final decision, of course, rests with the U.S. Congress,
which must officially sanction a plebiscite in order for the vote
to be binding. Despite determined lobbying by Rossello, Congress
has failed to schedule such a vote, saying it is waiting for a more
clear-cut consensus to emerge on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Ricans seem to be struggling toward that consensus, but
it may take years.
</P>
<P>
   With a gubernatorial election looming next November, statehood
will lose its most visible advocate as Rossello steps down. But his
New Progressive Party will continue to press the issue. A Rossello
deputy, former transportation secretary Carlos Pesquera, has been
christened the party's candidate for governor, and is already
dueling with Calderon on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Calderon proposes tweaking the commonwealth
relationship, guaranteeing irrevocable U.S. citizenship for Puerto
Ricans, while at the same time giving them more autonomy over
issues like trade.
</P>
<P>
   Observers discount the Puerto Rican Independence Party, which
has never attracted more than single digits at the polls. As for
the two major party candidates, they say it's too early to pick a
winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Puerto Rico is very interesting politically right now because
neither of the two major parties has more than 50 percent of the
electorate,'' said Maximo Cerame Vivas, a pro-statehood columnist
for the San Juan Star newspaper. ``One is 48 percent, one is 46
percent. There is a floating swing vote that decides the issues,
but it isn't solidly in one column or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossello's New Progressives have made steady gains in the past
two decades, rising from obscurity to the 46 percent support they
received in the most recent statehood plebiscite. They are now a
formidable opponent for the once-dominant Popular Democrat Party,
or PDP, which controlled 48 percent in the recent statehood votes.
</P>
<P>
   The PDP is the party of legendary Gov. Luis Munoz Marin, who in
1948 became Puerto Rico's first elected governor. He was the
architect of the plan which led to Puerto Rico's current status
with the U.S. _ a commonwealth territory or ``associated free
state'' in which islanders are governed by their own legislature,
but cede ultimate authority to the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Marin is credited with bringing Puerto Rico into the 20th
Century, pushing for tax breaks that attracted U.S. manufacturers,
while helping develop the island's prosperous tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
   But there are curious wrinkles to Puerto Rico's status that may
account for the island's deep divisions on the issue. Residents
receive most federal entitlement programs, including welfare, as
part of an estimated $10 billion in U.S. taxpayer dollars that
support Puerto Rico each year _ yet they aren't required to pay
U.S. income tax.
</P>
<P>
   They are U.S. citizens, but they cannot vote in mainland
elections. They have an elected representative in Congress, but he
has no vote.
</P>
<P>
   They fight and die in the U.S. military, but they have their own
national flag, their own contestants in beauty contests, and their
own Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   But while they enjoy many benefits from their association with
the United States, it is clear that most Puerto Ricans still feel
some ambivalence about the relationship. Intensely loyal to their
island's history and culture, they cannot forget the U.S. invasion
during the Spanish-American War of 1898 that relegated them to the
humiliating status of a colony.
</P>
<P>
   Along with that resentment is a lingering suspicion over a
particularly persistent Yankee problem: racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been 100 years since the U.S. invaded us,'' said Rafael
Roman, 51, a soft-spoken worker in a frame shop in historic Old San
Juan. ``Why haven't they given us statehood in all that time? I
believe they don't want us as a state because of discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of his fellow islanders, Roman shrugs when asked about
the status question. The population is split on the matter, he
said, because so many receive benefits from the United States and
have traveled there and like the opportunities they found.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they are still Puerto Rican,'' he said, holding a fist
near his heart. ``I am Puerto Rican. I want to be independent. This
is a nation, and the U.S. cannot take another nation within itself
as a state.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the young _ who switch effortlessly between English and
Spanish, dress in Tommy Hilfiger jeans and watch lots of MTV _
opinions seem more ambivalent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you took a vote today, most people would choose
statehood,'' said Jose Ivan Girona, 22, an art student from San
Juan who was raised in the United States by a father in the
military. ``I love the States. There is so much opportunity
there.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Girona sees the value in maintaining his Puerto Rican
identity. He just isn't sure how to balance that with his love for
things American.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we do become a state, we don't want to lose our
identity,'' he said. ``We are very different from the U.S. Our
culture and values are much more traditional. We know who we are.
We're Puerto Rican. But how that fits with being a state, that's
what we don't know.''

   CLAYTON, N.C. _ They're sprinkled among the barbecue joints and
decrepit gas stations: an occasional Mexican bakery, or a store
window plastered with movie posters in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   In Raleigh, Durham and nearby rural areas, Latino faces are
everywhere _landscape workers trimming bushes, construction workers
pouring concrete, field workers hauling endless yellow bundles of
tobacco leaf.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina's large cities, small towns and rural areas are
being transformed as Hispanic professionals, entrepreneurs and
laborers become a growing part of the state's booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the positive economic effects, the influx is forcing
governments, schools, churches and health-care systems to make
rapid and sometimes costly adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   In this central North Carolina town, Jose Juan Mendez stops by a
store called ``La Michoacana,'' which sports a plastic banner
echoing the red, white and green Mexican flag.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Mendez finds an assortment of Spanish-language compact
disks, Mexican action movies, imported sweets, fresh-baked
tortillas and other products with familiar brand names such as
``Tia Rosa'' and ``El Charrito.''
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old Mexican house painter from San Luis Potosi
smiles with a hint of melancholy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked only ten of the last fourteen days. It's not
enough,'' he said. ``But coming here makes me feel a little bit
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Jobs and a peaceful environment are attracting Hispanics such as
Mendez to North Carolina in record numbers, though officials
disagree what those numbers are.
</P>
<P>
   While the U.S. Census Bureau estimates that about 149,000 people
of Hispanic origin live in North Carolina, state officials say the
Hispanic population has more than doubled since 1990, to more than
200,000. Meanwhile, Latino advocates and business leaders put the
number much higher, between 350,000 to 500,000.
</P>
<P>
   With a nationwide population of about 27 million, Hispanics are
projected to surpass African-Americans as the nation's largest
minority group in about eight years. While highly concentrated in
five states _ Texas, California, Illinois, New York and Florida _
Hispanics have increasingly been moving into other Southern states.
</P>
<P>
   A better place
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, Hispanics are mostly settling in some urban
communities along the Interstate 85 corridor, in western Piedmont
counties, in eastern farming areas and near military bases.
</P>
<P>
   They occupy an increasing number of jobs in the food and hotel
service industries, as well as in construction, landscaping and
livestock slaughterhouses.
</P>
<P>
   While Hispanics cite jobs as the top reason for venturing to
North Carolina, there is a clear second reason _ what many refer to
as ``tranquilidad,'' or ``peace of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a much better atmosphere,'' said Pedro Aguilar, 34, who
worked in Los Angeles for seven years cleaning office buildings
before moving to North Carolina with his wife and four children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more discipline in the schools compared to Los
Angeles. People there live without order. There are gangs
everywhere. I don't want those values to stick to my kids,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Norma Herrera also came to North Carolina from Los Angeles in
search of steady work and a better environment for her teenage son.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a thousand times better,'' said Herrera, who is
Guatemalan and works at a turkey processing plant in Mount Olive.
``There is too much violence in California. Too many bullets. They
sell drugs in the schools. They get into it so quick. They forget
who they are. Forget about God. They finish dead or in jail or as
invalids in a hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebrahim Melendez, 47, who came to the United States from
Honduras in 1989, lived in New Jersey for five years before coming
to Raleigh with his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the smaller cities, smaller towns,'' he said. ``I like
the open spaces, the countryside. It's a state with a lot of
opportunity and above all, a lot of tranquility.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing problems
</P>
<P>
   While many Latinos sing the praises of their new, adopted state,
they also face many challenges.
</P>
<P>
   While not nearly at the levels of cities like Los Angeles or
Houston, crime is also a problem in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the first half of last year, nearly 100
Hispanics were victims of violent crimes in Durham, a number that
accounted for 15 percent of all violent-crime victims. That number
is roughly twice the percentage of Hispanics in Durham's
population.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Hispanics face a disproportionate number of crimes
because many have settled in low-income, traditionally high-crime
neighborhoods. In addition, many are unfamiliar with the criminal
justice system, have a distrust of police and speak little or no
English.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics in the state are also more likely to suffer accidents.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Hispanics made up about 2 percent of the state's
population, but accounted for 9 percent of its workplace deaths. In
addition, 25 percent of Hispanic deaths from 1995 to 1997 came in
motor vehicle accidents, as opposed to about 2 percent of white
deaths and 2.5 percent of African American deaths.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Hispanics in North Carolina face several health
care-related challenges some stemming from the language barrier. A
recent study recommended including $2.3 million in the state budget
next year for interpreter services at 85 local health departments
to remedy the situation.
</P>
<P>
   The study by the North Carolina Center for Public Policy
Research, a non-profit group funded mostly by private foundations,
found that Hispanics rely more heavily on local health departments
because they work in lower-wage and more dangerous jobs with fewer
benefits such as health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   This has put a heavy burden on some local agencies. The Durham
County Health Department reported serving 5,000 Hispanics in
1997-1998, or about 23 percent of its case load, and the Wilson
County Health Department reported that 30 percent of its clients
were Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   The study also revealed that only 69 percent of Hispanic women
receive prenatal care in the first trimester of pregnancy, compared
to 88 percent of white women and 77 percent of African-American
women. As a result, the study recommends an additional $250,000 in
next year's state budget to allow more health centers to provide
maternal care coordination services to women ineligible for
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   The study points out that Hispanic children are less likely than
the overall population to be immunized against childhood diseases.
It recommends funding immunization outreach workers in the 20 North
Carolina counties with the largest Hispanic populations.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics and local governments also face a growing challenge in
schooling. Several school districts are coping with the influx of
students who don't speak, read or write English. Many
administrators and teachers have expressed frustration with the
lack of resources for educating Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits have already been filed in some western North Carolina
counties such as Yadkin, Burke and Chatham on behalf of
non-English-speaking children, alleging that they are not getting
the free and appropriate education to which they're entitled under
federal law.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of these challenges, politicians are reacting. Gov.
Jim Hunt has started an Office of Hispanic/Latino Affairs, and Rep.
Bob Etheridge, a Democrat from Lillington, has created a Hispanic
advisory group and has begun translating some of his press releases
into Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   A new style of faith
</P>
<P>
   Religious organizations are also evolving as the population
shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Father John Heffernan, a priest at the Immaculate Conception
Catholic Church in Durham, realized things were changing about
three years ago when he first met ``Our Lady of Guadalupe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd heard the name, but I had no idea who she was,'' he said
of the image of the Virgin Mary that is revered by millions of
Mexican Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   According to the church, the Virgin Mary appeared to an Aztec
Indian 450 years ago as a haloed image in a starry blue cape coming
out of the clouds. Her image was miraculously imprinted onto the
man's poncho, which still adorns the basilica in Mexico City built
in her honor.
</P>
<P>
   At Immaculate Conception, she has become a constant presence. A
painting of Our Lady of Guadalupe now decorates a wall at the back
of the church, where worshipers can light votive candles and pray.
The church also has a statue of Our Lady of Guadalupe, which
Heffernan brings in front of the altar for Spanish-language
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   To serve the growing Latino population, Heffernan performs a
bilingual mass every Sunday. In addition, he performs Spanish
weddings, ``quinceaneras'' which celebrate a girl's 15th birthday,
and three times more Hispanic baptisms than all other groups
combined.
</P>
<P>
   He says he has grown very close to Our Lady of Guadalupe, who he
finds more cheerful than the church's Virgin of the Immaculate
Conception.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's beautiful,'' he said. ``I've come to love her.''
</P>
<P>
   Catholic churches are by no means alone in reaching out to North
Carolina's growing Hispanic community. Many other denominations
have embraced the new worshipers. Just down the road from
Immaculate Conception, Duke Memorial United Methodist Church has
signs on its lawn proclaiming in bold letters, ``Alabemos al
Senor,'' or ``Let's Praise the Lord,'' followed by information
about the church's Spanish-language activities, led by a minister
from Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Pan dulce and MTV
</P>
<P>
   Many Hispanics predict greater changes ahead for the state's
traditionally black and white landscape.
</P>
<P>
   A glimpse of the future appears in the pages of La Conexion,
which started as an eight-page publication about four years ago and
is now an 80-page, semi-weekly newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Run by the husband-and-wife team of Mike and Lupita Leary, the
Spanish-language paper includes local news, editorials, items from
Mexico, Latin America and Puerto Rico as well as separate sections
for entertainment and sports. The free publication is packed with
ads, including several for phone cards, satellite dishes and
money-wiring services.
</P>
<P>
   At Juanita's Bakery in Smithfield, Jose Arseo says he will stay
in North Carolina for as long as he can. Arseo came to North
Carolina three years ago from Nevada, where people were ``much more
racist'' and the jobs were ``not as nice and clean.''
</P>
<P>
   As he picks out some fresh ``pan dulce'' or sweet bread from a
glass bin, he tells Perla Joaquin at the counter that he just got
off work cleaning a nearby hotel and was heading home to his wife
and two children.
</P>
<P>
   As she takes his money she glances up at a TV screen in the
corner of the bakery _ it's Puerto Rican sensation Ricky Martin,
singing a pop song in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank goodness we have MTV en espanol,'' says the 18-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, near Mount Olive, a handful of men cut bundles of
tobacco leaf and throw them onto a truck. Despite 95 degree-heat,
the men are laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Altucer, 39, said he had arrived in North Carolina just
two days earlier, after a long journey from Campeche in southern
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two days and there's already work,'' he said. ``This is a
happy place.''

HOLLY PIERCE NO LONGER GREEN WITH ENVY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The village of Fanore sits on the west coast of Ireland. Most
people outside County Clare have never heard of this rural outpost
in the Burren. Farmland criss-crossed by stone walls, a one-room
schoolhouse, and a general store that doubles as the post office
fill the town. The bus to the big city leaves only on Tuesdays and
Thursdays, making several stops before it reaches Galway 40 miles
to the north.
</P>
<P>
   It's an unlikely place to start fulfilling big-time dreams.
</P>
<P>
   But American Holly Pierce found her way from Fanore to the
Football Association of Ireland (FAI). Saturday, the 23-year-old
soccer player and her Irish teammates will face the US women's
national team at Foxboro Stadium. Pierce will start at center
midfield while family and friends from Oregon cheer from the
stands. She will compete against former teammates from college and
US developmental programs.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pierce planned to compete for the red, white, and blue,
she realized the talent pool at home was too large and the timing
not good enough to give her a chance with the reigning world
champions. The former University of Portland standout knew that
once her college career ended, her soccer opportunities were
limited. If she did not make the national team before graduation,
there would be nowhere to play and gain the notice of US coach Tony
DiCicco and his staff.
</P>
<P>
   So Pierce became one of a growing number of talented US women to
export her soccer talent. Having an Irish mother allowed the
midfielder to obtain dual citizenship. An unsolicited e-mail caught
the eye of Irish team administrator Sean Brodie, and a May tryout
followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing it for a lot of reasons,'' said Pierce. ``Without a
professional league in the US, you can't play anywhere if you're
out of college unless you're on the national team. I wanted to play
at a high level. That's the way I enjoy playing. Also, I love
Ireland. I thought I would try it and see how the experience was.
The players and the team are great. I love to play soccer, and so
far this is a great experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to joining the Irish team, Pierce traveled through Europe,
making stops to play professionally in Russia and Germany. She did
not stay long in either country, citing cultural and contractual
differences as her reasons for leaving teams. The midfielder left
soccer behind and continued touring.
</P>
<P>
   When she reached Paris, Pierce decided to visit Ireland for the
first time. In January, she arrived in Fanore with a job that
combined work in the Burren and waitressing at the village's only
restaurant. Though she hadn't played soccer in months, Pierce was
still looking for opportunities to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Once Pierce accessed the Internet on a computer at a nearby bed
and breakfast, she sent a message to the FAI. It's not uncommon for
the FAI to receive e-mails from perspective female players, but
most of the requests for tryouts come from young women of Irish
parentage living in England. The message from Pierce was much
different.
</P>
<P>
   The American listed her college credentials, which included
earning all-league honors all four years at Portland and seeing
plenty of NCAA tournament action. At Tigard High School, playing
for her mother, Kit, Pierce led the Tigers to three consecutive
Oregon 4A state championships and was named one of the country's
``Super 11 Recruits.'' The clincher, however, was the two years
Pierce spent on the US under-20 national team. The Irish team
organizers understood they had happened upon a rare talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that immediately attracted me was that she had made
the US national under-20 team. You don't go much further than that
in terms of a reference,'' said Brodie. ``Her credentials were
perfect. I spoke to the manager and told him we had this e-mail,
and we brought her up for a trial. She probably could have arrived
in Dublin faster from New York than from where she was in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``For players of her caliber, soccer is a passport. It's brought
her all around Europe and brought her to Ireland and now brought
her to the Irish international team. Players of her caliber will
seek out top-level football where possible. It's not really a
question of advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   With soccer as her ticket to European travel and the Irish team,
Pierce needed to make several cultural adjustments. Women's soccer
in Ireland runs much differently than it does in the United States.
Listening to Irish music from the Chieftains and watching
Irish-themed films did not prepare Pierce for the way her new team
and country would approach the game she'd played since childhood.
</P>
<P>
   The differences in philosophy and financial resources between
the two countries are great. The Irish women's program does not
have the funds or the youth programs to compete with the US. In
addition to Pierce's experience on the US under-20 team, Brodie and
manager Mick Cooke liked the fact she was based in Ireland.
Otherwise, they could not have afforded to fly her over from the US
for a tryout.
</P>
<P>
   Costs also keep the team from holding long training camps, and
most players train on their own all over the globe. Pierce
currently works out with a boys' high school team in her hometown
of Tigard and will join her Irish teammates Thursday in Boston,
where they will reunite for the first time in a couple of months.
The Irish will have only two practices together _ one at Babson
College and one at Foxboro Stadium _ before facing the World Cup
champions.
</P>
<P>
   After playing two games for Ireland and then returning to
Oregon, Pierce does not know her new team well. However, the coach
has already seen the midfielder's play bring out the best in her
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's certainly a welcome member of the squad and has settled
in very quickly and is very much liked by everybody,'' said Cooke.
``She adds experience and brings a stability into midfield. She's
very comfortable on the ball, doesn't waste anything, and is
extremely fit. She actually brings out confidence in the other
players around her by her style of play.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the main objective of the Irish women's national
program is to increase the number of female soccer players across
the country. They are hoping to more than double the number of
participants in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The player base isn't sufficient,'' said Brodie. ``Even when
it comes to national selection, no matter how many players would
show up for a trial, realistically there's only about 25 players
pushing for the 18 spots. Now you compare that with the States, who
have (7 1/2 million) registered players. If somebody isn't
performing, they just make a phone call.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce added that women's sports rarely get the same respect as
men's sports in Ireland. The American-raised player said that
expectations for female athletes are not as high in Ireland. Games
played by the women's national team get poor publicity. Fans seldom
pay to watch matches featuring the women's national team. More than
likely, the visitors will experience culture shock Saturday with
close to 30,000 expected at Foxborough for the doubleheader that
includes the Revolution's game against Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know when I'll be able to play the US team again,''
said Pierce, equally excited and anxious about the opportunity. ``I
think the most I've played in front of is 4,000 or 5,000. It's
pretty surreal. I can't even comprehend it. The only thing I'm
thinking about is the game and how I can prepare myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a true Irish soccer player.

<P>
   BOSTON -- The streets around Fenway, always unnavigable, are a
study in still life, anger, and frustration. Parents and boyfriends
attempt to carry mattresses up four flights of stairs, and you
can't find an available U-Haul or telephone guy inside Route 128.
</P>
<P>
   Good morning, Boston. It's the beginning of September, the
weather is easy, the living is hard, the students are back, and the
Red Sox are in a (wild-card) pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox Wednesday won their sixth straight, helping them remain
two games ahead of Oakland in the playoff chase. A new class of
incoming freshmen (many from outside New England) gets to
experience Boston in the fall when the Red Sox contend. There is
nothing like it. Fenway Park should be in the
BC-BU-MIT-Harvard-Simmons-Emmanuel-Wheelock-Northeastern-Emerson
brochures. The Class of 2003 is a lucky lot.
</P>
<P>
   As a service to those who may not yet have enjoyed the Boston
baseball experience, we present a Fenway Freshman Orientation to
you new kids on the Kenmore block. Clip and save:
</P>
<P>
   --The Red Sox' new closer has never played in a band with
Stephen Stills or Graham Nash. He only looks like David Crosby. His
name is Rod Beck, an ex-Cubbie.
</P>
<P>
   --Pay no attention to hysteria about the final days of Fenway
Park. Fenway will still be standing when you graduate _ even if
you're in school for a Blutoesque seven years. The Sox have plans
for a new park, but it won't get done until sometime between the
end of the Big Dig and the beginning of the 22d century.
</P>
<P>
   --Buy peanuts outside the park.
</P>
<P>
   --There is no such thing as a Fenway sellout until (if) the Sox
make it to the playoffs. You can always get in the park via
bleachers or standing room. Warning: Do not buy tickets in any
section numbered 1-7. Better you should go for the bleachers or
standing room.
</P>
<P>
   --Red Sox manager Jimy Williams is not putting you on. He always
talks like that. And he's no dummie. Jimy can do the Times
crossword puzzle faster than you. The one ``m'' in ``Jimy'' is no
typo. Don't ask. He just likes it that way, OK?
</P>
<P>
   --Nomar Garciaparra is the Sox' everyday star. Chicks dig him
and no one touches his stuff. Watch how he puts both feet on each
step every time he goes up and down the dugout stairs. Nomar makes
Dustin Hoffman's Rain Man look like a spontaneous guy.
</P>
<P>
   --Pedro Martinez is the star pitcher. Many strikeouts. Few
walks. The Globe offers a handy-dandy Spanish story whenPedro
pitches at home (not Ramon, not yet). Also, do not break into
Pedro's house or he will shoot you.
</P>
<P>
   --No beer sales 2 1/2 hours after the start of the game.
</P>
<P>
   --The guy bolting on and off the field between innings is third
base coach Wendell ``Send-'Em-In'' Kim. Mike Barnicle in 1986 said
that if former third base coach Rene Lachemann worked as an air
traffic controller, there would be fuselages all over Boston
Harbor. Wendell's had that kind of year.
</P>
<P>
   --Tourists call it ``The Green Monster.'' Locals know it as
``The Wall.'' The ladder on The Wall is in play.
</P>
<P>
   --Please, no beachballs and no wave. And no leaving early to
beat the traffic.
</P>
<P>
   --When Brian Daubach is announced, stand up and say, ``Who needs
Mo? This guy gives you more for $80 million less.'' If a Sox
official hears you, he might give you tickets to an upcoming game.
</P>
<P>
   --First base and right field get the most sun during day games.
And the bleachers, of course.
</P>
<P>
   --Do not mock the organ music. Not even ``Copacabana.''
</P>
<P>
   --Unless you can eat glass and swallow barbells, wear no New
York team garb to Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   --Fenway can be a Love Boat. More than a few married couples met
at Fenway or had their first date there.
</P>
<P>
   --If you're on a Riverside train, get off at Kenmore, which is
actually closer than the Fenway Park stop.
</P>
<P>
   --Troy O'Leary is not Irish.
</P>
<P>
   --All this talk about 1918 has nothing to do with the first
World War or the post-Russian revolution.
</P>
<P>
   --It would take too long to explain, but avoid fighting words to
avoid fights. Fighting words include: Buckner, Dent, McNamara,
Schiraldi, Willoughby, Galehouse, Nanette, Frazee, Curse, and
Bambino.

RED SOX VALUE INVESTOR: DAN DUQUETTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Dan Duquette ever decides to switch careers, he could always
find a home on Wall Street. Whether he knows it or not, the Red Sox
general manager is a superb value investor.
</P>
<P>
   Value investors are bargain hunters. They buy stocks that are
out of favor, stocks whose price has been beaten down because the
company has reported disappointing earnings or because the economy
is in a slump. They buy on the expectation or the hope that their
investments have potential that the rest of the world doesn't
recognize.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine investing in Boston real estate in 1991 or in the stock
of bankrupt Filene's Basement today and you have some idea of the
kind of gambles value players routinely make.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes real fortitude and skill to be a value investor
because you have to buy when the news is bad,'' says Ned Riley,
chief investment officer at BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   Like when a pitcher is coming off shoulder surgery; or when a
player has toiled in the minor leagues for years and has been
written off by the rest of the league.
</P>
<P>
   Sound like anyone you know, Red Sox fans?
</P>
<P>
   Duquette's decision to replace Mo Vaughn with Brian Daubach at
first base this season could earn the general manager a spot in the
value hall of fame. Think about it: Vaughn, now a member of the
Anaheim Angels, earns about $13 million a year. Daubach, a
perennial minor leaguer, will get $215,000. Yet as of the moment,
Daubach and Vaughn have roughly an equal number of home runs and
RBIs _ and Daubach has a much higher average.
</P>
<P>
   If Daubach is a value home run, then some of Duqette's other
deals qualify as doubles, at least. In 1995 Duquette acquired
pitcher Tim Wakefield a few days after he was dumped by the
Pirates. The Red Sox signed him to a minor league contract, which
means he earned peanuts. The deal paid dividends immediately.
Wakefield went 16-8 for the Sox that year and helped the team make
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   That same year Duquette plucked Troy O'Leary off the scrap heap.
The outfielder had been let go by the Milwaukee Brewers. O'Leary
has since become the team's most dependable outfielder and could
drive in 100 runs this year.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Wakefield nor O'Leary is much of a bargain anymore.
Their success has translated into multiyear, multimillion-dollar
contracts. Just like stocks, ballplayers don't stay cheap once the
world sees what they can do.
</P>
<P>
   Need more evidence of Duquette's value skills? How about the
1997 trade he engineered with the Seattle Mariners? We gave them
relief pitcher Heathcliff Slocumb and they gave us catcher Jason
Varitek and reliever Derek Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   When he departed, the Globe wrote of Slocumb: ``That peculiar
form of torture known as Heathcliff Slocumb will no longer practice
in Boston.'' Slocumb went on to torture Seattle with his
inconsistent pitching. Varitek and Lowe, both nobodies at the time,
have since become the Red Sox's starting catcher and top relief
pitcher, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, Duquette's decision to sign Nomar Garciaparra
to a five-year, $23 million contract after his rookie year doesn't
seem to fit the value style. But remember: Value is a relative
term. If Garciaparra continues his All-Star ways _ he is currently
leading the American League in hitting _ his $5 million a year
paycheck may come to be seen as a bargain. Microsoft looked like an
expensive stock a year ago. It has doubled in price since then.
</P>
<P>
   Because investing is an art, not a science, even the best
investors stumble sometimes. Duquette is no exception. He gave
third baseman John Valentin a long-term contract at $6 million a
year. Valentin is probably worth one-third of that. Pinch hitter
Reggie Jefferson makes a lot of money for a part-time player.
Duquette's deal with Jose Offerman _ $26 million for four years _
looks pricey too, but it may be too early to make a judgment.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to know if Duquette comes by his value instincts
naturally or by necessity. Duquette's boss, Red Sox president John
Harrington, has been reluctant to pay the salaries it takes to
acquire superstar players. The one obvious exception was the
decision to pay pitcher Pedro Martinez $75 million over six years.
</P>
<P>
   Fans would love to see Duquette add a few more growth stocks
like Martinez to his portfolio. In the meantime, however, the
general manager is sticking to his discipline.
</P>
<P>
   This week the Red Sox picked up Rod Beck, a relief pitcher
coming off elbow surgery. Thursday night, another reclamation
project, Ramon Martinez, who last year had rotator-cuff surgery,
will make his Red Sox debut.
</P>
<P>
   Has Duquette found two more value gems? Stay tuned.

 BOSTON: ... Nativity scene.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each spring some annuals sprout unbidden from seeds in the
ground, including a few petunias that trace their lineage to Father
Ubaldis DePrizio, who worked the garden many years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When DelPriore started volunteering at the garden, there were a
couple of older men in charge, but they became ill and the wife of
one of them asked DelPriore, he recalled, ``with her husband
perhaps on his deathbed'' to take over, so that the garden was
waiting for him to get better. And he did get better, but not well
enough to take back the garden.
</P>
<P>
   And so DelPriore was left stranded in paradise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy it,'' he says. ``It's very different from the office.
But it's frustrating, getting no help, except from the maintenance
man who waters some mornings. People say they'll pitch in, and they
never show up! I think it's more a question of commitment than
anything else. It's not something you can do once in a while. It's
unrelenting. Things die if you don't show up.''
</P>
<P>

Old North Church
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What gets 4.5 hours of light a day and 600,000 visitors a year?
</P>
<P>
   The Eighteenth Century Garden at Old North Church.
</P>
<P>
   Just when it seems that cooperative gardening is an oxymoron,
that all gardens are one-man-shows (even those devoted to
brotherhood and peace), I stroll by Old North Church. And here I
find two beautiful gardens maintained by veritable gangs of people.
</P>
<P>
   Strong leadership is one key. Being a historic national shrine
doesn't hurt either. Old North Church still has the capacity to
inspire citizens to unite for our common welfare.
</P>
<P>
   On the north side of that church, where two lanterns signaled
the start of the Revolutionary War one fated night, is the
Washington Memorial Garden. It was created by the Beacon Hill
Garden Club 50 years ago, using funds from their famous annual
``Hidden Gardens'' tour. It is a low-maintenance garden that has
held up extraordinarily well since its most recent redesign in
1993, says Jennifer Wilson, one of eight club members who quietly
tend it.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Eighteenth Century Garden on the south side of the
church is in fact the newer garden. Here eight to 10 fast-track
professionals from all over the city converge on foot and by subway
for a brisk, well-orchestrated, work-study stint each Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The organizational mastermind behind this garden is attorney and
North End resident Marcia Casey. Hers is one of about 125 families
who worship at Christ Church in the City, a.k.a. Old North. Six
years ago the south garden was languishing when the previous vicar
gratefully greenlighted her project to turn it into a garden of
plants grown in the 18th century to fit in with the period of the
church. She did a ton of research and seemed to be having so much
fun that others soon joined her. Now the squad is up to 20.
</P>
<P>
   So how do you get volunteers to show up to weed?
</P>
<P>
   Casey runs the Eighteenth Century Garden like a 21st-century
company with e-mail schedules of upcoming projects. She speaks of
volunteer gardeners with ``different management styles and people
with different skill sets, such as growing seeds.'' She also makes
a point of pairing an experienced gardener with a newer gardener.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sign-up calendar so we don't all show up at the same
time. It's a great mix of people from 20 to 60, men and women, and
we see different people each time we come. We have parties, with
prizes for garden hats, it's fun, and we get hooked,'' says Lisa
Ayres, the current vicar's wife and a volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't hurt that gardening with antique herbs and flowers
has developed tremendous cachet, too. ``Marcia's always teaching us
about the 18th-century plants, the history, the botanical names,
says Ayres.
</P>
<P>
   Social events such as potluck suppers keep the volunteers
connected even in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   But now the pink mallow is still in bloom, the antique sweetpeas
are climbing their tepees, the black-eyed Susans are robust, and
the love-lies-bleeding is hugh and hanging just as it should with
droopy chenille-like flower clusters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard work at the beginning of the season but it pays off
when the tourists compliment us,'' says ``seedling coach'' and
volunteer, Deni Findlay. ``We're getting away from the pressure of
daily life, and so are they.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The tourists are enchanted and delighted because they're on
vacation. Some from far away and some from Quincy. But their joy is
another dynamic that supports the project,'' said Casey in her
characteristic business-speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``They peer in through the fence and say, `I love the garden!'
and we say, `Where do you live?' We say, `Join us!' We tell them
they don't have to have any experience. It is magical. And it's
highly spiritual.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, in fact, another one of those miracles.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS FOR CHURCH GARDENS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are tips we gleaned from our success stories on creating
church gardens that are not devilishly hard to maintain:
</P>
<P>
   --Plant low-maintenance trees, shrubs, ground covers, and bulbs,
not annual and perennial flowers.
</P>
<P>
   --Don't try to run a garden by committee. It's much better to
have a single authoritative person in charge who is committed to
ensuring success (and who will train their own successor).
</P>
<P>
   --Install an underground irrigation system with a
battery-powered timer.
</P>
<P>
   --Reserve at least half of any garden contribution for
maintenance expenses.
</P>
<P>
   --Have garden maintenance as part of the church budget, rather
than be dependent upon volunteers and special donations.
</P>
<P>
   --Hire a knowledgeable crew for spring and fall cleanup and
pruning. Don't be like the suburban church that tried to save money
by hiring a prison work detail that ``pruned'' trees by cutting
them to the ground.

REVOLUTION CLEANUP EFFORT SHOULD BEGIN SOON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanks to the paralyzing effects of central planning, the safety
net of the lack of relegation, and other MLS oddities, the
Revolution are in playoff contention in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   But there are few signs they will remain in this state of grace
for long. In fact, if form holds they should be effectively
eliminated either after Saturday's game against Tampa Bay or
following their visit to Miami Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution could well remain in mathematical contention for
one of the four playoff berths after those games, but unless they
win at least once in regulation time they should start planning for
next season. Lately, there has been no indication they are even
capable of doing that.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, even should the Revolution rally in the final seven
games of the season, they will have to make wholesale changes to
the team next year.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the players who have been involved in the last two
dismal seasons should be sent away, both for the team's and their
own good. This means some very good performers, along with mediocre
ones, will be lost.
</P>
<P>
   Joe-Max Moore, for instance, will certainly play his final
Revolution game this season. Moore, though, will have a chance to
return to Europe, where he played for Nurnberg before joining MLS
in 1996. Moore's contract with the league expires after this
season, and his transfer should be negotiated simply.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution have failed the last two seasons because they
simply have too many weaknesses and not enough variety. The very
elements that might have saved the team have been excluded or
ignored. The team has enough defensive midfielders, though Leonel
Alvarez is a welcome addition, and complementary hard workers. It
needs some experienced, skillful performers who can make everyone
else better, starting in central defense.
</P>
<P>
   Player-coach Walter Zenga is taking most of the blame for the
Revolution's current plight. And Zenga has surely made mistakes,
but none bigger than when he took over the team last August and
overestimated the players and his ability to transform them. Even
Zenga's spectacular goalkeeping has not enabled the Revolution to
find a winning formula.
</P>
<P>
   The gap between the Revolution and other top teams was
graphically illustrated during a 2-1 loss to the Chicago Fire last
Saturday, the ninth consecutive game in which the Revolution failed
to win in regulation time.
</P>
<P>
   This is Zenga's first coaching position. But most other
experienced coaches would have handled Revolution personnel
similarly. They would have been convinced that the Revolution had
enough talent to solve their own difficulties, and if they tried to
change the equation, the holdover players would have resisted. And
that coach would have been sacrificed.
</P>
<P>
   Revolution management has tried changing coaches and importing
several foreign players. The problems remain.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the Revolution require a change of philosophy.
They need to go in a different direction. Team management simply
rejected Edwin Gorter, Francis Okaroh, Welton, and Andy Williams _
all creative players who had been successful and would go on to
have more success _ and the Revolution's core group of players
seemed to approve of the moves either tacitly or otherwise. Others
who might have helped were frozen out, or simply did not ``fit in''
with the team.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution could have been on the way to solving their
problems had they acquired defender Joseph Addo last month, but
instead will have to start over next year. That was a mistake
general manager Brian O'Donovan will either have to live with or
attempt to correct, because Zenga clearly preferred Addo over
striker Ariel Graziani.
</P>
<P>
   Rebuilding can be a long process. The sooner the Revolution
begin, the better.

CLEANING TIPS FOR SOAPSTONE AND GRANITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. How can I clean an old soapstone sink? It doesn't leak, but
looks pretty tired. Also, how can I clean smooth granite tiles that
have oil stains?
</P>
<P>
   JOE DORAN, Westford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Clean the soapstone with paint thinner. Put it on liberally
so that it can dissolve the dirt, but do not let it evaporate.
Scrub with a sponge or Scotch pad, then wipe clean with a dry
cloth. That will clean it, but it might be pretty light in color.
To condition the soapstone, which will turn it black or dark green,
according to the type of soapstone, wipe mineral oil on the surface
liberally, wait 15 minutes, rub with your hands, and then wipe up
all that will come off with a dry cloth. Unwiped, the oil could
stay sticky for years. You can repeat this technique any time.
</P>
<P>
   As for the granite, it may be difficult to remove the oil stain.
As hard as it is, the granite has absorbed the oil. To remove, wet
it with paint thinner, then sprinkle lots of baking soda on the wet
stain. Leave it for an hour, then sweep up and dispose of.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Walter Mucha of Brookline, Mass. called to sympathize with
people trying to find old, dicontinued, and obsolete tiles for
their kitchen and bathroom renovation projects.
</P>
<P>
   He also shared this information on removing old adhesive and
grout from the tile: ``I use tile nippers to take the hard grout
off the edges of the tile. That's the easy part. For removing old
adhesive, I make a mix of chemical paint remover and liquid
paintbrush cleaner, and submerge the tiles for three or four days.
After that, the adhesive comes off or is easily scraped off.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, Walter, for the great ideas. Actually, I think
scraping the grout off the tile edges is easier and faster with a
utility knife. But the adhesive idea is brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   The handyman has done a similar thing with spool bed spindles.
Those spindles are the very devil to remove finish from because
they are spooled. So the handyman stole his wife's long cake pan
(borrowed, really, but after what he did with it, the pan was not
worth returning). He filled it with chemical paint remover and
dropped in the spindles, which, of course, had to take them out of
the bed frame in the first place. That was the hard part. The easy
part was rubbing the spindles with steel wool after a day or less
in the soup. Everything came out very nicely.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My concrete driveway is very old and in some sections is
pretty beaten up, cracked, and no longer level. Should I repair
those sections or cover the whole thing with asphalt?
</P>
<P>
   MARK McLANEY, Malden, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If some of the sections are still in good shape, why not keep
them that way and replace the sections that are not. A concrete
driveway is usually poured in sections, with expansion joints every
6 feet or so. So, cut out the beaten up concrete, excavate deeply
enough to put down 6 inches of crushed stone under the new
concrete, and pour a sectional slab 4 to 6 inches thick. Six is
better than 4; in fact, I am guessing that the slab failed because
it was only 4 inches thick. And, to prevent cracking and failure in
the future, install 6-inch steel reinforcing mesh or 3/4-inch steel
reinforcing rods (rebars) in the center of the slab's thickness.
</P>
<P>
   You will have to set up enough of these sections so you can
order concrete for pouring. A minimum order of concrete is usually
2 yards.
</P>
<P>
   All this is better than putting asphalt on top of a partially
unstable base. And, if you do it yourself, you can do one section
at a time, doing others whenever you feel like it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My pine dining room table is pretty seedy-looking. I have
used furniture polish on it once a month. How can I clean it and
make it a bit shinier, without refinishing it?
</P>
<P>
   P.C., Winthrop, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The table got seedy-looking from overuse of furniture polish,
which in the handyman's opinion, mostly dulls the finish.
</P>
<P>
   To restore the finish, clean it with paint thinner, which will
dissolve the polish so it can be wiped off. Apply the thinner
liberally, let it sit on the surface for a few minutes (add some if
it starts to evaporate), scrub with a cloth, then wipe off
everything with a dry cloth. The paint thinner will dull the finish
more than it is now, but you can restore most of it by buffing with
a dry cloth.
</P>
<P>
   A varnished, lacquered, or shellacked finish does not need
polishing or waxing, or any protection at all; it is its own
protection. So go very easy with the polish. Not at all or at most
once a year, and sparingly, as well.

BOSTON, FROM GHOST TO GHOST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who knows what evil lurks in the heart of Boston? The
Gravedigger does.
</P>
<P>
   And so does the Caretaker. Solomon the Gravedigger and Revere
the Caretaker are your horrifying hosts on one of Boston's newest
and most unusual tours, ``Ghosts &AMP; Gravestones.'' The two-hour
nighttime excursion in a black trolley takes you to graveyards and
streets where many a strange tale was born.
</P>
<P>
   Revere, wearing a hood and dressed all in black, is the driver
and caretaker _ ``and you'll need all the care you can get,'' he
says. Solomon, who carries a lantern and wears a stovepipe hat with
funeral ribbon attached, is the gravedigger _ ``and I really dig up
the dirt.'' He keeps that promise as he leads you from the trolley
to explore on foot (and with flashlight) these three places:
</P>
<P>
   --Boston Common. Centuries ago, Solomon says, this was a place
where happy crowds gathered _ to watch hangings from an elm tree.
There wasn't much to do for recreation in those days, he explains,
so an execution took on a celebratory air, with vendors selling
pies and sweetmeats. Meanwhile, what today is the Frog Pond was in
the 1600s a muddy spot where miscreants were forced to take a
ducking via a dunking stool.
</P>
<P>
   --The Granary Burying Ground. Several Revolutionary War patriots
are buried here, including Paul Revere, who identified the corpse
of his friend Dr. Joseph Warren (which for a variety of reasons was
often disinterred), and James Otis, who correctly predicted he
would die by a thunderbolt. Many gravestones are marked with a
winged death's head, a solemn symbol in times past. And from the
graveyard there is a view of the Boston Athenaeum, where you can
peek in to try to spot the ghost who is said to quietly sit and
read there _ a ghost first spotted by author Nathaniel Hawthorne.
</P>
<P>
   --Copp's Hill. This North End site provides excellent views of
the steeple of the Old North Church and Bunker Hill. But it is the
burial ground that holds dozens of stories, including how two
strangers came to share a gravestone and how one woman ended up
buried with dozens of sailors. Cotton Mather, so prominent in the
Salem witch hysteria, lies here, too.
</P>
<P>
   The stories don't stop there. As Revere takes you from place to
place in the Black Dahlia, as the trolley is named, he tells tales,
too. You hear about the man who in the 1700s somehow ``flew'' from
the Old North Church steeple, firing pistols as he landed. And
about the true incident behind Edgar Allen Poe's grisly story ``The
Cask of Amontillado.'' And how the human spirit was scientifically
shown to weigh 6 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Revere points out notorious sights, such as the
home of the last victim of the Boston Strangler. There is a bit of
mock gunplay and swordplay as well, and passengers get to practice
banshee screams. There is even a look at the frightfully expensive
Big Dig road project. And there is music, including ``The Monster
Mash,'' ``Ghostbusters,'' ``I Put A Spell on You,'' and the Lizzie
Borden song that contains this practical advice: ``You can't chop
your mother up in Massachusetts . . . it's a far cry from New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   As you may have surmised, there are chuckles along with the
chills. After all, as Revere notes, the first three letters of
``funeral'' are f-u-n.

FOR CEDRIC WASHINGTON, THE TIME IS NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- He has patiently served his time _ sitting and
watching, watching and sitting _ as a backup to Omari Walker,
Quinton Lee, and Mike Cloud, who last year rushed for 1,726 yards
and 14 touchdowns to become Boston College's all-time leading
rusher with 3,597 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But Cedric Washington waits no more.
</P>
<P>
   When the Eagles open their 101st season of football Saturday
afternoon by hosting Baylor at Alumni Stadium, the 5-foot-11-inch,
201-pound junior from Holyoke will finally get his chance to emerge
from the shadows of his high-stepping predecessors and step into
the spotlight as BC's starting running back.
</P>
<P>
   With senior Carlton Rowe still nursing a pulled groin and
freshman sensation William Green still coming along, it will be up
to Washington, who was second on the team last year with 37 carries
for 173 yards, to handle the bulk of the work in BC's rushing
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be nervous,'' Washington admitted Wednesday.
``Last year, I don't think I was nervous one time going into a game
because Cloud was carrying the load, but now I'll be starting for
the first time, and I'm getting nervous just thinking about it
right now. I'm just looking to have a big day and try to put our
team in a position to score.''
</P>
<P>
   The presence of Green, a highly-touted recruit from Atlantic
City who was impressive in preseason camp, will only add to
Washington's sense of urgency. He realizes that if he is not
productive, then Green, the thoroughbred waiting in the wings, is
capable of taking the ball and running away with the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every college football player has to deal with that, a
highly-recruited freshman coming in,'' Washington said. ``You've
got to perform or else you're going to take a back seat. Willie
Green, he's a great running back and he's young, but he's got to
learn the offense first before he can do anything. He's going to be
a hell of a running back for us in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   But not quite yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the present,'' Washington said, smiling. ``So now it's
my chance.''
</P>
<P>
   And Washington is hoping to make the most of it, the same way
Cloud made the most of his opportunity, bursting onto the scene two
years ago as a junior and rushing for 211 yards against West
Virginia as a substitute for the injured Walker. It served as a
springboard to Cloud's senior year, in which Washington was
promoted to backup when Lee was kicked off the team after his
arrest for public drunkenness and disorderly conduct following a
31-7 victory over Temple Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   So what lessons did Washington learn from watching Cloud?
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, when you get your chance, you've got to shine, and
that's what he did,'' Washington said. ``I'm in the same situation
now. He had to wait around three years, and his (junior) year he
finally got in there and rushed for something like 800 yards, and
that started everything.''
</P>
<P>
   And while it was an extension of Cloud's equally phenomenal high
school career, the numbers paled in comparison to the astronomical
figures Washington put up at Holyoke High, where he set a state
record with 2,881 yards, including five 300-yard games and 41
touchdowns, to lead his team to an 11-0 record and the Western
Mass. Super Bowl title with a 46-17 victory over Greenfield. In
that game, Washington recalled, ``I carried the ball about 45
times, had something like 300-350 yards, and scored five
touchdowns. All on hard runs.''
</P>
<P>
   On weekend trips home to visit his girlfriend, Jamie Gonsor, and
their 2 1/2-year-old daughter, Jordyn, Washington dealt with
persistent questions about why he wasn't producing the same numbers
at BC.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something that motivated me,'' said Washington, who was
recruited by Notre Dame, Nebraska, Syracuse, and North Carolina
State before committing to BC. ``Being from Holyoke, a small town
that no one really knows where it is, I want to try and put that
place on the map, and this is my chance to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether he can be as productive at the college level as he was
in high school is another matter. While he expects to get more
carries than the three per game he averaged last year, Washington
knows he'll absorb a greater amount of punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could take its toll physically because my body's not used
to taking that pounding,'' Washington said. ``That's why it's so
important to me to have Carlton and Willie ready to give me a
break. I'm not like a power runner; I'm more of an elusive runner.
I want to try and get one-on-one with a safety, make some moves,
and put on a show. I'll be nervous, but after that first play I
think I'll be fine.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ It would seem to be the equivalent of
starting out in the penthouse, so when Bill Spence tells you his
first job in the industry was at Pebble Beach, he is fully prepared
for looks sent his way.
</P>
<P>
   Quizzical. Perplexed. Disbelief. As in, ``How could you ever
leave?''
</P>
<P>
   There is a slight grin on his face as Spence delivers an
explanation that speaks volumes about what he is all about. ``Being
superintendent at Pebble Beach isn't what you think,'' he said. ``I
was always in the office. I had three superintendents working for
me. I never got my hands dirty and never spent one day working on
the course.''
</P>
<P>
   So, after 3 1/2 years, Spence left a place that many golfers
would swear is heaven on earth. And they may be right. ``Carmel was
the most beautiful place to live,'' said Spence. ``I took my wife
out of Carmel in tears.''
</P>
<P>
   He spent 7 1/2 years at Kansas City CC in Kansas, then made
another move, this time with his wife's blessings. The former Mae
Nickerson had grown up in Jamaica Plain, had spent many wonderful
days walking at Lars Anderson Park and now her husband was going to
be superintendent at The Country Club in Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   For her, a return home to New England with her husband and three
boys. For him, arguably one of the premier jobs in his industry,
one that would allow him to get his hands dirty. But a job, now
that the Ryder Cup is virtually upon us, that surely is causing
sleepless nights, right?
</P>
<P>
   Not quite.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction (when it was announced a few years ago that
TCC would host the Ryder Cup) was to be excited for my staff,
because they are young and have never experienced something like
this before. I've been through it, though this is the biggest.''
</P>
<P>
   Bigger than the 1977 PGA Championship at Pebble Beach. Bigger
than those annual Bing Crosby Pro-Ams. Even bigger than the 1988 US
Open at The Country Club, an event Spence was very much a part of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to The Country Club in 1984, and that August they
agreed to host the '88 Open,'' said Spence. Rees Jones has been
brought on board to restore the course, and it was Spence's job to
see that those plans were carried out throughout 1985-86. ``The
first, fourth, and 17th greens were completely redone, and we
enlarged 10 other greens that had been made smaller during the war
years to save money.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, said Spence, the Jones restoration included 25
bunkers, the re-leveling of 16 championship tees, and a new
irrigation system.
</P>
<P>
   The '88 Open, he said, was a huge undertaking, but the Ryder Cup
is even bigger. It is 11 years later and the sport has become that
much more popular. More exposure. More people. More corporate
tents. More television cable.
</P>
<P>
   But at least, said Spence, no more restoration. This time, the
preparation was all his.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we have done is refine (the earlier project). We've
reshaped 96 bunkers and put in new sand. We've widened fairways in
some spots by (a mere) 12 inches, just to let the ball roll better.
But it's the same course. The same great course.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ben Crenshaw, captain of the US Ryder Cup team, shares Spence's
love of The Country Club. ``Ben may know the course and its history
as well as anyone,'' said Spence.
</P>
<P>
   But a golf course, even one that is rich in tradition, is only
as good as its caretakers, a fact that both Crenshaw and Spence
point to.
</P>
<P>
   ``The superintendent (Spence) is a naturalist,'' said Crenshaw,
``and that's so important to keeping the place special.''
</P>
<P>
   Spence credits the genius of those who built the place more than
100 years ago, as well as the members who have nurtured it through
the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The golf course is a work of art. Beauty is different to
different people, but The Country Club members are secure in their
love of the place, so if someone doesn't like the course, it won't
bother them.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a crisp fall day almost a year ago when Crenshaw
walked the course with Spence. They discussed philosophies and
pointed out quirky subtleties that make the course a ``classic'' in
every sense. Crenshaw's genuine love of the event and of the course
shined through, said Spence.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point, he said to me, `We could play this thing right
now.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Spence and Crenshaw did not meet face to face Monday when the
captain and eight of his players were at The Country Club for a
practice round, but Spence took that as a promising sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``No news is good news, I guess. I heard they generally liked
what they saw. If there were problems, I probably would have heard
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that Spence and his crew have had an easy
summer. It's just that he's been at this business a long time and
knows some things are out of your control, namely the weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``The winter and lack of spring combine to offer the most
difficult hurdles every year. Last year we got 50 inches of rain
(in the spring) and there wasn't a brown blade of grass on the
course. Back in 1988 we had a cool, wet May. The course was
perfect. Then we got blasted with really hot weather and there
wasn't much rough for the Open.''
</P>
<P>
   This year? ``We did OK. My three assistants _ Greg Barker, Jeff
Baker, and Scott Lagana _ and my great staff (including Emma, the
border collie) never stopped.'' It got hot and there wasn't much
rain, but remember, Spence is a superintendent who believes:
``Brown grass is OK.''
</P>
<P>
   You know, the naturalist. The naturalist who also happens to be
a devoted weather-watcher. Has to be in his line of work. As early
as April this year he confessed to the one thing that concerned
him: ``The long-range forecast called for the most active
(hurricane season) in memory.''
</P>
<P>
   And with that season upon us, Spence is still paying attention.
``I'm going to the radar right now to see about (Hurricane)
Dennis,'' he said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spence will tell you that he's been most fortunate in his jobs.
``I met Jack Neville (the man who designed Pebble Beach) once. He
was 90 and I remember thinking, `I can't believe I'm sitting here
with the guy who laid this thing out.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At Kansas City CC, a certain member who could lay claim to five
British Open titles used to go out of his way to say hello and talk
about all things golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason Tom Watson stayed there,'' said Spence, ``is that
it was one of the few places where they would leave him alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, to get the chance to understand the game of golf from
one of the premier players was an amazing opportunity, and I
learned a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty impressive for a guy from New Jersey, a self-confessed
``golf nut,'' whose first love was journalism. That changed at the
University of Massachusetts where, in addition to meeting Mae,
Spence studied for four years in the turf management program,
graduating in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided what I wanted to do was be outdoors,'' said Spence.
``It was the back-to-nature thing of the '60s.'' It led to a job
with Monmouth County Parks in New Jersey, then to Pebble Beach, to
Kansas City, to Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funny,'' he said. ``We had a lot of visitors in Carmel, but
none in Kansas City.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be familiar faces at The Country Club during the
Ryder Cup, though they won't be visitors. His eldest sons _
Christopher, a senior at Williams College, and Ryan, a sophomore at
Franklin High School _ will be working with him at The Country
Club. Will, a fifth-grader, ``could care less about golf,'' said
Spence.
</P>
<P>
   So let the show begin, said Spence. ``The place is a
character-builder. It will be a great match-play course.''

SADLER'S A BOOST FOR THE LEAD-FOOTED RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Can we all agree on this much anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Sadler can run.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's put such life into the team,'' Mike Stanley says. ``He
puts down two bunts, and both times the guy barely bobbles the
ball, and anybody else would still be out. Not Donnie. He's on
first. And (Jose) Offerman hits a 200-foot fly ball down the line
the other night. (itals)Nobody(unitals) else on this team, and very
few people in the league, could hope to score on a ball like that.
But he did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget about offense,'' says Jimy Williams. ``Watch him go
after popups.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Sadler is a baseball type, and it is a type seen in these
here parts about as often as Republican in the mayor's office. He
is one of those pesky, faster-than-a-cheetah, disruptive types
usually found in the (itals)other(unitals) manager's dugout. If
this 24-year-old, 5-foot-6-inch Texan is not the single fastest
player ever to wear a Red Sox uniform, than, by God, he's among
'em.
</P>
<P>
   But right now he is merely another type. He is the
inexperienced, unpolished, dripping with potential, teasing type.
Run? Oh, can he run. Catch it? Without question. Throw? His arm may
be as amazing as his speed. Hit? Well . . .
</P>
<P>
   It's the oldest saw in baseball: (unitals)You can't steal first
base.(itals) Then again, Sadler isn't so sure. He is on record as
saying that if he hits a routine grounder to short he has a 50-50
chance of beating it out. So the idea would be for Sadler to hit
enough ground balls and line drives to get on base at least 175-200
times a season. Throw in some walks _ and a glance at his resume
doesn't exactly suggest the second coming of Eddie Yost _ and
you're talking about somebody who could score 120-plus runs in a
season. You think maybe you'd like a guy like that leading off here
for maybe the next 10 years?
</P>
<P>
   He was at third base in place of the ailing John Valentin
Tuesday night, and it wasn't solely because of his phenomenal
speed. ``He's hit a couple of balls through the hole lately,''
explains an approving Williams, who would benefit more than anyone
if Sadler could justify his presence in the lineup on a regular
basis. ``And the other night he drove in a couple of runs on a ball
up the middle. He realizes what he has to do.''
</P>
<P>
   That, according to Sadler, is no accident. ``I got a taste of
the major leagues last year,'' he says. ``I saw what it took to
play at this level. I went home last winter and worked on certain
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as?
</P>
<P>
   ``Cutting down on my swing,'' admits the powerfully-built second
baseman/shortstop/center fielder/third baseman/whatever. ``I didn't
really make any other changes. I just realized I had to put the
ball in play.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the veterans are fascinated with Sadler, because they
have seen these speedball types before, and not all of them have
made proper use of their tools. ``I'd probably put Donnie in the
ultra-speed category,'' says the thoughtful Darren Lewis. ``Tom
Goodwin comes to mind. He can get down the line in less than four
seconds, and Donnie is right there. But the thing I'd like to see
him do is learn how to get a jump stealing bases. If he doesn't
learn to do that he won't be using one of his primary assets.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to steal second, however, a man must be on first, and
that's where batting coach Jim Rice comes in. ``There are things he
needs to learn,'' Rice points out. ``And if he can learn them, look
out. If he can hit balls to make the infielder move two or three
steps left or right, instead of surrounding the ball, he'll have 40
to 50 infield hits a year. If the shortstop has to go into the hole
by two or three steps, he has no chance to throw out Donnie
Sadler.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no questions about Sadler with a glove on his hand,
and it really doesn't make any difference where you put him. His
natural position is shortstop, but that position appears to be
occupied at the moment. His second base play draws raves from
everyone, especially in the range department. ``He had Jimy
laughing last week in Minnesota,'' points out Stanley. ``Jimy was
hitting fungoes and he couldn't believe how far from Sadler he had
to hit the ball to get it by him.'' Third base for Sadler will be,
as the legendary Eddie Pellegrini used to say, like ``camping
out.'' And while he really doesn't like playing in the outfield, he
has a chance to be a Gold Glover.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was out there in right field at times during infield
practice during spring training,'' says Stanley, ``and he has by
far the best outfield arm on the team, and one of the best outfield
arms you'll see anywhere. If you put him out there, he would shut
down running games.''
</P>
<P>
   Every once in a while a guy comes here with some speed. Tommy
Harper stayed around long enough to set the club stolen base record
(54). Jerry Remy got people excited with his legs before knees
terminated his career prematurely. Otis Nixon gave the Red Sox one
dazzling year in center and on the basepaths.
</P>
<P>
   None of them were signed and developed by the Red Sox. Sadler is
that rarity of rarities _ a blue chip Red Sox prospect whose
calling card is speed. How far back would you have to go to find
someone like that in this town? Tris Speaker?
</P>
<P>
   Sadler is so tantalizing. Speed. ``It puts pressure on the
opposition,'' muses Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Speed. ``It makes so many things happen,'' adds Stanley. ``There
was a ball hit to left with Donnie on second the other night, and
with anyone else (third base coach) Wendell (Kim) is holding his
hands up. He waves Donnie home and we get a run.''
</P>
<P>
   Speed. ``That speed,'' drools Williams. ``He has a chance to be
an exciting player.''
</P>
<P>
   He's halfway there already. He's exciting, all right. But is he
a Player? A salivating Red Sox Nation is eager to find out.

BMW'S NEW STATION WAGON INSPIRES CONFIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time when the station wagon was the minivan or the
SUV of American car culture. That time was in the 1950s, when the
big family wagon was a symbol of comfortable suburban life: haul
the kids to Little League games, haul the family on vacations.
</P>
<P>
   America was on the move and families were on the move _ in their
wagons.
</P>
<P>
   How things change. Today, minivans, SUVs, and four-door pickup
trucks, purchased with the idea of carrying family, gear, and
goods, rule. Yet the station wagon is making a subtle comeback, and
it is coming from unexpected quarters: foreign luxury car makers.
</P>
<P>
   While Taurus, Sable, and Saturn continue to crank out wagons in
what for them is a shrinking domestic market, BMW, Saab, Mercedes,
Volvo, and Audi all offer new wagons. Subaru has long been a solid
player at the lower end of this niche. BMW will add a 3 Series
wagon early next year to move toward the lower end of the market.
At the upper end, there are rumors that Jaguar has a wagon on the
drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   None of what's out there will haul the goods and passengers that
a big SUV or minivan will haul; these are more like the smaller
SUVS _ such as Toyota 4-Runner _ in their capacities.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of them is the BMW wagon, available in the 528i and 540i
models _ 6 and 8 cylinders respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days in the 528i _ five-speed manual transmission _ revealed
it to have more in common with luxury sports sedans than the
classic notion of a station wagon. Yet there was all that space
behind.
</P>
<P>
   It drives like a luxury sports sedan because, excepting the box
that is its rear end, that's what it is. It rides on typically
stiff and nimble BMW suspension: struts, coil springs, twin-tube
gas shocks, and antiroll bars up front; 4-link integral suspension
with coil springs, twin tube gas shocks, and antiroll bar in the
rear.
</P>
<P>
   The disc brakes, front and rear, are nearly a foot in diameter,
and when the aluminum calipers clamp onto them, the car comes to
sure, straight, and sudden stops.
</P>
<P>
   Dynamic stability sytems aid both in keeping traction just right
and in braking.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-cylinder aluminum block engine cranks out nearly 200
horsepower and makes the car most responsive as you work the
five-speed transmission with a moderate-throw, relatively stiff
shift lever.
</P>
<P>
   With much of my travel done on highways, the car got about 24
miles per gallon _ quite respectable given its powerful
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, this is a car that inspires confidence. Stomp the gas,
and a controlled rumble moves right up through the seats. This is a
tight car and a quiet car.
</P>
<P>
   The multifacted, stiff suspension means that the 528i provides
some moderate jarring on bumpy roads, yet the swap is that on
smoother, faster roads it is remarkably firm and free of
side-to-side lean when passing, and it clings to corners with
almost no body roll. It is so well-balanced, in fact, that it is
subtly fast, and at least twice it crept up to 90 miles per hour by
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Its traction-control system was effective, though a little
annoying in that it kicked in _ and chirped a warning _ far earlier
than I felt it needed to.
</P>
<P>
   Though the 528i is billed as a five-passenger car, when the
passengers are adults, it is really more suitable for just four.
Even three young children on the rear bench seat got antsy and
feeling crowded on a four-hour drive.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that this wagon is a luxury beast abounds on the
inside: leather on the dash; leather trim on the doors; broad, firm
leather seats that adjust electrically and can be programmed to
remember who you are and how you like your seat set.
</P>
<P>
   Storage space is only adequate _ door bins are thin, a tiny
rolltop bin opens in the console between the front seats (I wonder
now what takes up all the space beneath the top of the console.)
</P>
<P>
   Typical of BMW, the gauges _ bathed at night in that wonderful
orange glow _ are simple but useful. Tachometer, speedometer, and
other gauges are clearly visible through the upper spokes of the
steering wheel. Four of the five windows that sit below these
gauges are dark, except when they flash a warning _ door open,
problems with lights _ while the fifth is an electronic font of
information that can be scrolled by using a button on a stem off
the steering column. It tells you, in sequence, mileage on the car,
mileage on a particular trip, outside temperature, average fuel
consumed, how many miles to go before fuel is gone, and average
speed for your trip.
</P>
<P>
   Buttons built into the steering wheel operate cellular phone,
radio, cruise control, and can switch air supply from outside to
recirculate.
</P>
<P>
   In the heat of day, or cold of night, zoned climate control lets
each front-seat passenger get as hot or cold as they want.
</P>
<P>
   The rear of the car is easily accessible through a lift-up
hatch. The flat floor makes loading and unloading easy (a nifty
roll-out floor that extends like a table is an intriguing option)
and cargo cover and luggage net keep loads contained.
</P>
<P>
   The rear seats fold down, and for two people on, say, a long
weekend of antiquing, this would be a comfortable, useful auto.
</P>
<P>
   If the load gets too heavy on the rear springs, those gas shocks
sense the load and pneumatic pressure is applied to bring the rear
end up to its normal height.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The finger-wheel operation of the dash vents that control the
flow of air.
</P>
<P>
   --The way the front seat rises as you move it forward with the
controls, the assumption being that if you need to be closer to the
pedals, you are probably also a bit shorter and could use the extra
boost.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The cup holders, which look like an afterthought and are
virtually useless. They emerge from the dash less than a half-inch
from the platform on which a drink rests _ and that means they hold
nothing effectively.
</P>
<P>
   --The rear-view mirrors _ way too small. Coming down an entrance
ramp, I found myself hunching my face forward of the steering wheel
to find traffic approaching from behind.

FOREIGN GROWERS LAUNCHING A MAC ATTACK

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; HARVARD, Mass. _ Forget the drought. It's the People's
Republic of China that has New England apple growers really
worried.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to survive a glut partly caused by a dramatic rise in
Chinese apple production, local growers are promoting the McIntosh
apple as something as much a part of New England as clam chowder or
lobster stew.
</P>
<P>
   New billboards around Boston celebrate the McIntosh, which
accounts for about two-thirds of the region's apple crop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taste New England,'' the billboards say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make the McIntosh a niche apple,'' says Frank
Carlson of Carlson Orchards Inc. in Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   As this year's harvest begins, local growers have a lot more
things to fret about than drought, hail, and kids who don't want to
follow them into an ever more difficult family business.
</P>
<P>
   Excess supply, flat demand, mergers in the supermarket business
_ all have made life harder for US apple growers.
</P>
<P>
   Their biggest challenge may come from China, now the world's
largest apple producer. In 1998, China grew about 40 percent of the
global crop, an amount nearly four times US production.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the US apple industry looks to marketing as a way
to
</P>
<P>
   get Americans to eat more apples, and to be willing to pay
higher prices for niche apples including the McIntosh.
</P>
<P>
   As local McIntosh growers urge consumers to ``taste New
England,'' a $40-million marketing campaign from Washington state
aims to convert consumers into apple connoisseurs. Accounting for
about half of the US apple crop, Washington state wants folks to
think of Red Delicious and Granny Smith apples in the same way a
wine lover regards a fine Merlot.
</P>
<P>
   ``A banana is just a banana,'' says Jim Thomas of the Washington
Apple Commission. ``They all taste pretty much the same.'' But an
apple? ``It's more like wine,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   With about 2,500 varieties to choose from, the marketing pitch
is that the apple offers discerning gourmets a rich diversity of
enjoyable and healthful eating.
</P>
<P>
   Promoting apples is hardly new. In the apple annals of the early
1800s, the legend of John Chapman looms large. Better known by the
nom de pomme of Johnny Appleseed, he ranged far from his native
Leominster, planting apple trees wherever he roamed. If Chapman
were alive today, he might well be found hard at work in China.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, China has increased its annual production of apples
by nearly 70 percent, according to Kraig R. Naasz, president of the
US Apple Association, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   And some of that increased production has found its way into the
United States in the form of apple-juice concentrate.
</P>
<P>
   In only three years, the Chinese share of the US market for
apple-juice concentrate grew from 1 percent to 18 percent, Naasz
says. During the same period, the average price US growers received
for a ton of juice apples fell from $153 to $55, a price so low
that some growers concluded it was better to let some apples rot on
the trees than pay the cost of picking them.
</P>
<P>
   According to Naasz, China is so eager to gain a foothold in the
US market that it's guilty of dumping _ selling its products below
cost. His group is lobbying the US government to impose tariffs on
Chinese apple imports.
</P>
<P>
   In the industry, juice apples used in processing are
distinguished from fresh apples, or the eating apples that are sold
on supermarket shelves. New England, which accounts for about 3
percent of US production, grows mostly fresh apples.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the Chinese juice glut, many US growers in other
states that grow a lot of juice apples are switching more to fresh
apples. One result: New England now faces stiffer competition from
New York and Washington growers.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese competition has hurt in another way. Traditionally, a
quarter of the US crop has been exported. Once US growers owned the
apple markets in some Asian countries, but the landscape has been
rearranged by new rivals and devalued foreign currencies that can
make US apples too pricey overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to dominate Thailand,'' says Thomas of the Washington
state apple group. ``Now we have to fight for market share with New
Zealand, China, Australia, and France.''
</P>
<P>
   Shrinking foreign markets mean a larger fraction of the US apple
crop has to be absorbed by the domestic market. Throw in excess
supply caused by West Coast bumper crops, and the money US growers
got for their apples fell from $1.58 billion in 1997 to $1.29
billion in 1998, Naasz's group says.
</P>
<P>
   By Naasz's lights, 1998 was a Murphy's Law of a year that found
the industry in ``an economic tailspin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that could go wrong did go wrong,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Even more things went wrong in New England. For openers, a wet
spring discouraged bees from pollinating the trees, and regional
production in 1998 fell sharply as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the troubles of domestic apple growers can be traced
to the Chinese, bad weather, and balky bees, however.
</P>
<P>
   At the supermarket, consumers now have more choices. With fast
shipping and new techniques for preserving freshness, the apple is
just one fruit among many fighting for shelf space.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be you couldn't get raspberries in December, and
who ever heard of clementines?'' says executive director Russell
Powell of the New England McIntosh Growers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many supermarket chains are consolidating in an
effort to defend themselves from incursions by Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
into the food business.
</P>
<P>
   For growers, consolidation means fewer places to sell apples and
less bargaining power when dealing with bulked-up chains.
</P>
<P>
   Mergers in the supermarket industry have ``really tightened the
screws'' on apple growers, says Gerald White, an agricultural
economist at Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   To lessen their dependency on supermarkets, many local growers
run roadside fruit stands and pick-your-own orchards.
</P>
<P>
   With a petting zoo and a farmer's market, Echo Hill Orchards in
Monson seeks to be a sort of theme park for apples.
</P>
<P>
   Touting apple-picking as family entertainment, Echo Hill relies
almost entirely on revenues from tourists and city dwellers and no
longer sells apples to supermarket chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a supermarket calls up, I say no,'' co-owner Richard
Krupczak says. ``They pay so little.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the gloom and doom, Powell of the New England growers
group thinks the McIntosh apple is the key to regional survival.
</P>
<P>
   The McIntosh's chief selling point is the distinctive
sweet-and-tart taste it gets from New England's odd mix of weather
and soil. It's a taste hard to duplicate elsewhere, Powell claims.
</P>
<P>
   One drawback: The McIntosh is more delicate than most apple
varieties and requires careful handling by consumers. On the plus
side, it's less vulnerable to gluts. There may be too many Red
Delicious apples on the market. Indeed, supply and demand are out
of whack for many apple varieties because they can be grown in so
many different places.
</P>
<P>
   But the supply of McIntoshes is more often in line with demand,
says Ned O'Neill, an executive at Joseph P. Sullivan Co. in Ayer,
one of the region's largest apple packers.
</P>
<P>
   Powell's prescription for a New England rebound? Focus on
growing quality McIntosh apples and market them relentlessly.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, let China be the Budweiser of apples, making
juice for the global masses. But there will still be room for a
well-promoted quality McIntosh, the apple equivalent of a
microbrewed beer.
</P>
<P>
   Says O'Neill: ``The McIntosh is our niche.''

TIME-SHARING UPDATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two decades ago, firms like Microsoft Corp. taught us that
software is something you buy. It comes in pretty boxes with
confusing, badly written manuals. Every year or two, you buy a new
version with brand-new bugs that won't get fixed until you buy yet
another version.
</P>
<P>
   It's come to be an annoying yet vaguely pleasurable habit, like
smoking. But it's a habit that a host of new companies are trying
to break. They're called ``application service providers'' or ASPs,
and they want businesses to stop buying software and start renting
it.
</P>
<P>
   ASP operators like Andover-based Navisite Inc. say buying and
running business software makes no sense for many firms. The stuff
costs a fortune, and you have to keep updating it. Besides, you
must buy computers to run the programs and hire workers to oversee
it all. Why not simply rent a network connection to the ASP's
powerful server computers and let them process your data?
</P>
<P>
   As new ideas go, it's one of the oldest. Computer
``time-sharing'' was hot stuff in the '60s, when somebody noticed
that mainframes can do a dozen tasks at once. Firms began renting
time on them to businesses who couldn't afford machines of their
own. The ASP concept is time-sharing, updated for the era of PC
servers and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the second coming of the moribund boomlet in network
computing that swept the industry a couple of years ago. We were
all supposed to give up on expensive ``fat'' desktop computers
stuffed with costly software from the likes of Microsoft Corp.
Instead we'd use ``thin client'' machines connected to a powerful
server, sitting in another room or another city.
</P>
<P>
   I bought into this fad, but it flopped, partly because desktop
computers are about two-thirds cheaper than three years ago. Still,
I've kept the faith. Network computing is bound to catch on in some
form, because it dramatically simplifies life in a computerized
world.
</P>
<P>
   Traver Gruen-Kennedy, chairman of the ASP Industry Consortium in
Wakefield, calls the ASP concept ``the revenge of network
computing.'' But this time around, ASPs aren't in the hardware
business.
</P>
<P>
   First-wave network computer firms like Sun Microsystems Inc. and
IBM Corp. hoped to make a fortune selling specialized thin-client
devices. Nobody wanted them. But ASPs are happy to let us keep
using our Pentium IIs, as long as they're linked to the ASP's
servers.
</P>
<P>
   There's another good sign for the ASPs: Larry Ellison is keeping
his mouth shut. Ellison, the CEO of database maker Oracle Corp.,
almost single-handedly discredited network computers with grandiose
claims that millions of ordinary consumers would buy them, relying
on slow telephone modems to download whatever software they might
need.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is claiming that ordinary folks will use ASP-based
programs in the near future; that would be as unprofitable as it is
impractical. The big money will be earned as companies play host to
business computer services. Clare Gillan, vice president for
applications research at International Data Corp., figures it'll be
a $2 billion market by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of firms want a piece; Sun Microsystems just bought German
office software firm Star Division, to offer Star's office software
as a rentable Internet application for firms that don't want to
spend $300 a pop for Microsoft Office.
</P>
<P>
   Is Microsoft worried? Probably not, at this early stage. Yet by
accident, the company landed a blow against network-based software
this week. The break-in at Microsoft's Hotmail free e-mail service
exposed the messages of 50 million users, and reminded us it can be
dangerous to store data on somebody else's computers. ASP customers
might also fret about last month's network collapse at MCI
WorldCom, an outage that disconnected thousands of corporate users.
Firms that count on ASPs will always be at their network's mercy.
</P>
<P>
   But then, we're all at the mercy of the Internet these days.
Many of us now wonder how we ever did business without it. The ASP
people hope that in a few years, firms will ruefully recall the
Dark Ages, when they spent a fortune every year buying and
upgrading software, when they might have been renting it.

ACER ASPIRE POINTS THE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It's usually not very interesting to review each month's crop
of desktop computers. Frankly, they just aren't very different from
one another these days. Most machines have a keyboard and a mouse,
a screaming-fast microprocessor, not enough memory (you almost
always have to upgrade), and the standard collection of
input/output ports.
</P>
<P>
   The software that comes with the machines is also pretty
standard. If the computer is designed for business users, you get
the operating system and usually little else. Machines targeted for
consumers come with Microsoft Works, cut-down versions of Microsoft
Money and Intuit's Quicken, and perhaps antivirus software.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there are changes coming to desktop computers.
Besides getting faster, they are becoming easier to set up, use,
and somewhat more forgiving. Last month I was fortunate enough to
have an Acer Aspire 6160 on my desk. In many ways, this computer _
and the entire Acer Aspire product line _ shows what's coming down
the line for many Windows users.
</P>
<P>
   The Acer 6160 is somewhat easier to set up than other computers
because it is based on the Universal Serial Bus (USB). Gone are the
traditional keyboard, mouse, and serial ports that clutter up the
backs of most computers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Aspire has four neat USB ports. You plug the
keyboard into one port, the mouse into another, and the speakers _
yes, the speakers _ into a third. Unlike other machines, it doesn't
matter which plug goes into which socket. The fourth is a spare,
for future expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The USB, however, only goes so far. Although the speakers do
plug into the USB socket, they only use the USB interface to power
their built-in amplifier. A second wire runs from the speakers to
the computer for the sound itself. This wire is analog. It would
have been more daring, and only a little more expansive, if Acer
supplied the Aspire with fully-digital speakers. Then there would
have been just one wire, and much better sound.
</P>
<P>
   The USB keyboard is a good idea, but in addition to the cable
the keyboard should have two USB sockets of its own, so that you
could plug in a mouse and perhaps a digital camera. That's the way
the USB works on Apple's iMac, and Acer should have copied it.
</P>
<P>
   Acer also should have put USB connectors on both the front and
the back of the computer, perhaps giving customers eight sockets,
rather than just four. Nevertheless, Acer's use of USB is a good
first step.
</P>
<P>
   On the software side, Acer boasts an innovative feature called
the Aspire TimeMachine. The idea behind the TimeMachine is rather
simple: when a Windows-based computer stops working properly, it's
usually because some important file has been deleted, or some new
file has been installed in the directory that shouldn't be there,
or because some critical application setting has been altered.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the TimeMachine. Once a day, the Aspire TimeMachine
program takes an electronic snapshot of the operating system, all
of the application files, the configuration files, DLLs, and the
Windows registry.
</P>
<P>
   Then, if something stops working, you can use the TimeMachine to
roll back the system to the way it was on a previous day when
everything was working properly. And because you might not
immediately realize there are problems, the TimeMachine stores many
snapshots on the hard disk _ one a day for the past week, one a
week for the past few months, and one for each month going back a
full year.
</P>
<P>
   I was skeptical about the TimeMachine software when I first
heard of it, but after trying it out a few times, I'm a believer.
The snapshots happen when you aren't paying attention, they don't
take up any space at all, and the restore process really works.
</P>
<P>
   How is it possible that the snapshots don't take up any space?
Because Acer hides them on the computer's hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Although my Aspire was allegedly delivered with an 8 gigabyte
hard disk, a detailed inspection revealed that disk's true size is
12 gigabytes. Those extra 4 gigs are used to hold TimeMachine
snapshots.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening here is that Acer is selling its computers with
a hard disk larger than advertised. The company is then using that
additional disk space to decrease its technical support costs.
</P>
<P>
   My Aspire also came with version 5.0 of Inoculan Antivirus.
Whoops! While Acer should be applauded for supplying this, the
virus signature files included with the program are more than a
year and a half out of date, and the product itself has been
discontinued. That's not very useful.
</P>
<P>
   If you buy the computer on line at http://www.shopacer.com/
you'll find Acers are pretty competitive. The 6150 I've been using
has been discontinued.
</P>
<P>
   But in its place, consider the Aspire 6151. It has a 500 Mhz
Pentium III with 64 megabytes of RAM, 8.6GB of hard disk, a
DVD-ROM, and a 17-inch monitor, for $1299. Pay an extra $99 and you
can get it with 128MB of RAM and 10GB of disk space. If you want to
run speech recognition, be sure to get 128MB.

SOAP-OPERA TOUCHES MAR MOODILY EFFECTIVE `TWIN FALLS'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the myriad symbols of singularity, duality and solidarity
in ``Twin Falls Idaho'' is a TV screen displaying the title of ``A
Tale of Two Cities.'' It's a fitting reference, because ``Twin
Falls'' is the best of movies, and it's the worst of movies.
</P>
<P>
   In its peak moments, it's one of the most aching cinematic
portraits of loneliness in recent memory, a film that inspires an
almost physically painful melancholy. At other times, it's one of
the more plodding movies in recent memory, and it inspires musings
about how it might be a TV movie dressed up in an art-film suit.
</P>
<P>
   The loneliness emanates from its three main characters:
Conjoined twins Francis and Blake Falls (played respectively by
director Michael Polish and his brother Mark; they also co-wrote
the screenplay), and Penny, the dime-store prostitute who arrives
as a birthday gift and stays on as the troubled brothers' lone
friend.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomer Michele Hicks' Penny has the fortune or misfortune _
depending on your point of view _ of looking like a young, goth
Demi Moore. She even has some of Moore's mannerisms, and she's
stuck with one of the most hackneyed roles in Hollywood: the hooker
with a heart of gold. But that doesn't keep her from being the key
to everything that works about ``Twin Falls.'' She gives a
performance of unusual compassion, her searching eyes convincing
you that although she's curious about the connected twins, it's not
because she sees them as a curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine this movie without Hicks, because it's hard
to imagine anyone else empathetic enough to make you believe that
she could dig into the psyche of the Falls brothers (who live in a
dingy hotel on Idaho Avenue, hence the movie's title). As played by
the Polish brothers, they're cut off, more innocent than alienated,
steeped in an almost palpable sadness. They're also morose; little
of the movie's rare humor comes from them. And although fused
together, their personalities are a little too indistinct: Blake,
the dominant one who provides sustenance for the ill Francis, is
only marginally more effusive than his pain-racked brother.
</P>
<P>
   During its first hour, the movie concentrates on the growing
relationship among the twins and Penny, who especially relates to
Blake. As long as the focus is there, everything's fine. But when
the movie strays to other characters, it leans on cheap comic or
dramatic touches.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as troublesome is a subplot about a woman (Lesley Ann
Warren) who may or may not be the mother who abandoned the brothers
at birth. Despite being stuck with a particularly unflattering
makeup job that gives her a sickly green pallor, Warren does what
she can to make this character sympathetic. But her character's
appearance, coupled with Francis' mysterious disease-of-the-week,
only underscores the soap-opera elements.
</P>
<P>
   If a director's job is to steer his film around such story
potholes, Michael Polish's first feature film is a misfire. But if
his job is to create and sustain a mood, Polish's debut is a
triumph; despite all the movie's flaws, it has the rare ability to
give you that heavy feeling in your chest, the one that comes from
having your heart moved and your breath taken away,
</P>
<P>
   In the end, ``Twin Falls''' mood wins out over its flaws, a
victory of sadness over schmaltziness. Any two people are likely to
have radically varying reactions to it, some lauding its lyricism
while others lament its slow-paced self-consciousness. It's a movie
where difference makes all the difference _ but it's not as
different as it looks. Or as it thinks it is.

 A drink a day may be a cardiac risk reducer
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The martini might not replace the apple in health adages, but in
a study this week, Boston researchers suggest that light to
moderate alcohol consumption lowers the risk of sudden cardiac
death for men.
</P>
<P>
   Several large-scale studies have found that people who have
about one glass of beer or wine or a mixed drink a day have a lower
overall risk of death and a lower risk of death from heart disease
and stroke. But other research has documented a higher risk of
breast cancer among women who have a drink a day.
</P>
<P>
   The new study in the journal Circulation, led by Dr. Christine
Albert of Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the largest to look
specifically at light to moderate alcohol consumption and sudden
cardiac death. Earlier studies had found that heavy drinking, or
more than five drinks a day, increased the risk of sudden cardiac
death.
</P>
<P>
   In their report, the Boston researchers found that the risk of
sudden cardiac death for men who drink between two and six drinks a
week was 60 to 79 percent lower. The report, which followed more
than 21,500 men in the Physicians Health Study for 12 years,
included 141 cases of sudden cardiac death.
</P>
<P>
   Sudden cardiac death is the most common cause of death in adults
younger than 65.
</P>
<P>
   If the mechanism behind how alcohol appears to reduce the risk
of sudden cardiac death can be unlocked, it ``could lead to the
development of preventive therapeutics that have the benefits of
alcohol without the accompanying risks,'' the authors write.
</P>

 &UR; Counting sheep? Try focusing on the woolens
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You've tried sleeping pills, drinking a glass of warm milk, and
counting sheep, but none of them helps you get to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Try socks and mittens.
</P>
<P>
   In the current Nature, researchers from the Chronobiology and
Sleep Laboratory in Switzerland report on an experiment that shows
that warm feet and hands are the best physiological predictors that
sleep is coming on quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our findings provide further insight into the thermoregulatory
cascade of events that precede the initiation of sleep,'' write the
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, studying a sample of 18 healthy young men, took
measurements of heart rate, body and skin temperature, and other
factors. Sleepiness was rated every half hour.
</P>
<P>
   The physiological factor most able to predict whether sleep was
coming rapidly turned out to be the dilation of blood vessels in
the feet and the hands, which the researchers suggest can be
brought on by keeping the extremities warm.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Hub studies throw light on women's diet, health
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Women who want to decrease their risk of heart disease could eat
two to three servings of whole grains a day.
</P>
<P>
   People who have been diagnosed with breast cancer and want to
improve their chances of survival could eat a diet rich in protein
other than from red meat and not worry so much about the foods
being low in fat.
</P>
<P>
   Those are among the findings this week, in two different
publications, reported by the Nurses' Health Study based at Brigham
and Women's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   One study, reported Wednesday in the American Journal of
Clinical Nutrition, found that women who ate two to three daily
servings of whole-wheat bread, popcorn, oatmeal, or brown rice had
a 27 percent lower risk of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   The other study, published Wednesday in the journal Cancer,
found that a diet rich in proteins from poultry and dairy products,
not red meat, appeared to lower the risk of death among breast
cancer patients by up to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found, contrary to common belief, that women who
ate a low-fat diet after being diagnosed with breast cancer did not
have a better survival rate. They also noted that eating more
vegetables seemed to help, but only for women whose cancer had not
spread.
</P>
<P>
   Some earlier studies found a higher breast cancer death rate
among women with the highest total fat intake. The authors of the
new study say their research looked specifically at a woman's diet
after she was diagnosed, not before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diet after diagnosis is very important to study, because for a
woman who has breast cancer, it is only diet after diagnosis that
can be changed,'' said Dr. Michelle Holmes of the Brigham, who led
the study.

SEXY FARCE ASSEMBLES THE RIGHT ELEMENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's odd that men have always been perceived as the more
sex-obsessed gay gender, especially when the new lesbian comedy
``Better Than Chocolate'' has more blush-inducing moments than the
gay-themed ``Get Real,'' ``Edge of Seventeen,'' ``Trick'' and the
upcoming ``Steam'' combined.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``Chocolate'' may hold the record for most ``marital
aids'' displayed in a feature film; maybe that'll wind up as a
category on the MTV Movie Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there's anything wrong with a little provocative humor.
Lesbian sexuality has remained somewhat of an enigma to both
straight men (whose only exposure to it is within the ridiculously
unrealistic confines of pornographic films) and gay men (who'd
rather not think about it). And ``Better Than Chocolate'' director
Anne Wheeler manages to broach the subject with tenderness and
humor, but also an ample amount of heat.
</P>
<P>
   Karyn Dwyer is the soft-spoken, 19-year-old Maggie, a college
dropout who spends her days working at a lesbian bookstore and her
evenings performing at the local watering hole.
</P>
<P>
   When Maggie encounters an attractive, artistic drifter named Kim
(Christina Cox), the two become fast friends, heating up rapidly on
their way to something more.
</P>
<P>
   But their budding romance is put on hold when Maggie's brother,
Paul (Kevin Mundy), and her mother, Lila (Wendy Crewson), show up
unexpectedly after Lila's marriage hits the skids. Mom, of course,
is unaware of of the changes in her daughter's life, apart from her
desertion of higher education. But their new living arrangement
promises to be educational for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Paul starts dating the sexually adventurous Carla (Marya Delver)
while Lila is befriended by transgendered nightclub singer Judy
(Peter Outerbridge), who she thinks is a woman. Judy, meanwhile, is
in love with the androgynous Frances (Ann-Marie MacDonald),
Maggie's repressed boss.
</P>
<P>
   The title comes from Lila's nervous obsession with noshing
chocolates, a habit she's able to break only after finding a
suitable substitute. You'll have to learn what that is for
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler has assembled a terrific cast of unknowns, and everyone
is up to the challenge of pulling off this sexy farce _ Outerbridge
(last seen as an uptight FBI agent on ``Millennium'') is
particularly engaging. But the picture would benefit enormously
from tighter editing; as it stands, its almost two-hour running
time should push the patience of even its most devoted target
audience.

   Q: What were the names of the crew members who served with Lt.
John F. Kennedy on PT-109 when it was rammed by the Japanese ship?
</P>
<P>
   _ R.L.M., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: When PT-109 was broken in two by the Japanese destroyer
Amagiri on Aug. 2, 1943, Kennedy and 12 other crew members were
aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Two crewmen, Andrew Kirksey and Harold Marney, were killed in
the collision. The survivors were Raymond Albert, Charles Harris,
William Johnston, John Maguire, Edgar Mauer, Patrick McMahon,
George Ross, Ray Starkey, Leonard Thom and Gerald Zinser.
</P>
<P>
   After 15 hours in the water, Kennedy and the other survivors
reached a small island three miles from the crash site. They later
swam to another island in search of food, and were rescued on Aug.
8 after encountering island natives who contacted a New Zealand
camp at Rendova.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who towed McMahon by swimming with the injured
crewman's life jacket strap in his teeth, was awarded the Navy and
Marine Corps Medal and the Purple Heart Medal.

DVRS ARE BEING TOUTED AS A TV REVOLUTION

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most hot new companies insist their product is going to change
the world, but two California start-ups promising to revolutionize
the way people watch television are beginning to attract a lot of
believers.
</P>
<P>
   Their revolution, as measured by sales of so-called digital
video recorders, hasn't really begun yet. But the companies' goal
of using computer hard drives to give people greater control over
their TV viewing _ including instant replays, putting live TV on
hold, and recording shows all year long with one click of the
remote _ has shaken up the broadcasting world and spawned
soul-searching about the future of TV.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, some of the biggest names in the
entertainment and Internet world have showered millions of dollars
on the two companies selling DVRs, TiVo Inc. of Sunnyvale and
Replay Networks of Mountain View. WebTV, owned by Microsoft, is
expected to enter the market later this year in an alliance with
satellite broadcaster Dish Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's caught everyone in the industry by surprise,'' said Peg
Murphy, vice president of business development for NBC Interactive,
which has invested millions of dollars in both TiVo and Replay
Networks. ``It's one of the few interactive TV applications to come
along in the last few years that makes sense because it actually
makes watching TV easier.''
</P>
<P>
   The bugs are still being worked out of the technology, but there
is a growing buzz about how DVRs will allow consumers to escape the
straitjacket of network schedules and possibly avoid TV
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to make a complete change in the way people
watch TV,'' said Josh Bernoff, TV analyst at Forrester Research in
Cambridge, Mass. ``What you're seeing here is the beginning of an
enormous change in the way TV works.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a videocassette recorder, a digital video recorder records
and plays back TV shows, but without tapes or any complicated
programming. All you need to know is the name of the show; there's
no need to know when it's on or the channel. A couple of clicks
with the remote and it's done. You can direct the machine to record
the show every time it comes on. It even sets its own clock.
</P>
<P>
   The digital video recorder captures the incoming TV signal,
compresses it, and records it on a computer hard drive. The machine
plugs into a telephone jack and downloads up-to-date channel
lineups for the coming two weeks in the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   DVR users can view a show from its beginning while it's
recording, unlike users of a videocassette recorder, who must wait
until a recording is done to start watching. Say you want to record
the ``Sopranos'' on HBO at 9 p.m. on Wednesday and watch it that
same night, but the children aren't put to bed until 9:30. Just
click on the ``Sopranos'' when the house is finally quiet and start
watching from the beginning while the DVR continues to record the
end.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you're not recording a show, the digital video recorder
is always recording some of whatever show is being watched. That
can come in handy. Say you're watching a live broadcast of a
baseball game and your mother calls. You can hit pause, take the
call, and later resume watching where you left off. Or you can hit
instant replay and watch Nomar Garciaparra make a play at shortstop
again. DVRs put the viewer in charge.
</P>
<P>
   The first reaction of most people is that a DVR is nothing more
than a souped-up, computerized VCR without the capability of
playing taped movies. Reviewers so far have liked the technology
but been turned off by the price.
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from $500 to $1,500, depending on the recording
capacity, which runs from eight to 30 hours using the poorest
recording quality. Recording capacity drops dramatically as the
quality of the recording _ or the amount of data recorded _ is
increased. TiVo and WebTV also have monthly subscription fees of
$9.95 and $24.95, respectively, although TiVo offers a lifetime
subscription for $199.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety percent of US homes have VCRs, but the machines haven't
really changed the way people watch TV. Only a third of VCR users
tape a TV show at least once a week, and just under a third never
tape anything, according to a survey released earlier this year by
the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts think DVRs will change that and end up
changing TV in the process. They think DVRs will become portals to
television, much the way America Online, one of many TiVo
investors, has become a major access point for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of watching live TV, consumers may increasingly select
shows they want to watch days or weeks in advance and use their
DVRs to watch them whenever they want. The TiVo machine monitors
your viewing habits and records shows it thinks you might like.
ReplayTV allows users to customize their own networks around a
theme or a favorite actor.
</P>
<P>
   Bernoff of Forrester Research predicts DVRs will be the
fastest-growing consumer electronics product in history, with four
out of five homes having one within 10 years. The impact on TV will
be enormous, he says. ``Primetime'' could become increasingly
irrelevant as more shows get recorded for later viewing, while
middle-of-the-night time slots could become hot properties in an
environment where time-delay TV is the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Bernoff's boldest prediction is that the millions of people who
will watch TV on a DVR will skip through the commercials, knocking
the economic pins out from under the broadcast networks. Certainly
DVRs make it easy: ReplayTV lets the user skip forward in 30-second
increments, while TiVo offers a high-speed fast forward. A decade
from now, Bernoff predicts, ad viewing will be cut in half, as
consumers decide it's more efficient to watch NBC's three-hour
Thursday night lineup in two hours and 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ent of Boston, who bought a TiVo DVR, says the ease of
recording has changed his viewing habits. He now records his
favorite shows and watches them whenever he wants, almost always
zapping through the ads. ``I'm sort of out of sync now with live
TV,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is convinced. Karen Agresti, senior vice
president and director of broadcasting at Hill, Holliday, Connors,
Cosmopulos, said the same gloom-and-doom network scenarios were
popular when VCRs came on the market. ``This is technically not a
new idea,'' she said. ``The majority of people still watch shows
when they air.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Ryan, the head of Pro Media Inc., a Natick, Mass.
media-buying firm, says it will be hard to change entrenched
viewing habits. ``That's really not how people view TV,'' she said
of the DVR time-shifting philosophy. ``And, besides, some people
like to watch the commercials.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy at NBC Interactive said the network continues to believe
programming will be ad-based, but she acknowledges it may not
revolve around 30- or 60-second spots five years from now. ``We
don't think this is going to be revolutionary overnight,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that media titans like NBC, CBS, Showtime, Walt Disney,
Time Warner, Liberty Media, Comcast Corp., and Cox Communications
are investing in TiVo and Replay Networks may have an impact on the
debate. Officials at TiVo and Replay Networks are downplaying their
machines' ad-zapping capabilities and stressing a willingness to
work with broadcasters and the advertising industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to give viewers more control, but we're very sensitive
to the business issues of our partners,'' said Stacy Jolna, vice
president of programming and media partnerships at TiVo. ``There is
a happy medium there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Jolna says, the onus will be on advertisers to make
sure people continue to watch their ads. General Motors, for
example, is working with TiVo on targeting ads at specific TiVo
owners. In other words, GM might run an Oldsmobile ad during ``60
Minutes,'' but as TiVo users replay the show at a later time GM
might substitute ads that would be more appropriate for each user.
Families might see a minivan ad, while singles might see an ad for
a sports car.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone acknowledges that DVR technology and programming
is in its infancy. Recording time is limited, channel switching is
sluggish, and DVRs make an annoying, crackling computer sound
constantly. But improvements are expected. In less than two years,
Bernoff predicts that a machine with 24 hours of recording time
will cost less than $500. The machines themselves could disappear
as the technology is incorporated into cable TV set-top boxes and
satellite broadcast receivers, and coupled with on-screen Internet
access.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Who says miracles don't happen? Everytime a volunteer
shows up to weed a church garden, that's a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Though many church gardens have been designed and planted, often
financed by a congregant's gift in the name of a departed loved
one, the results are usually fleeting. Unlike, say, a memorial
stained glass window, a garden is the gift that keeps on costing,
either in terms of volunteer time for weeding and watering or in
money to hire maintenance crews. So the magnificent perennial beds
or the carefully labeled collection of plants that enjoy mention in
the Bible usually quietly vanished a few years after their proud
installation.
</P>
<P>
   Landscape architect Joe Hudak of Westwood has learned by
experience that so-called ``cast iron'' plants that need almost no
care are the best choice for most church landscapes. ``I find it
disappointing that so many of the gardens don't get the upkeep they
deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing this only makes me appreciative of those few church
gardens that manage to be both ambitious and well cared for. Each
one is, in its way, a miracle of faith. And each has a story. Not
about how the garden came to be built, but about who is keeping it
alive and why. Here are several such miracles in downtown Boston.

an ongoing battle at the Church of the Advent on Beacon Hill to
keep several small streetside landscapes healthy and serene despite
storms, weeds, litter, building renovation, and periodic work on
the pilings under the church.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, John, contributed much of the money for
garden construction in 1991 in memory of their son Peter who had
died the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a named space. The church doesn't do that. But on the
Sunday after it was planted, Father Mead came out with the whole
parish and blessed the garden,'' said Britton of the garden's
memorial overtones, quietly adding, ``A lot of people don't know.
But I know.''
</P>
<P>
   However, paying for the garden turned out to be only the first
babystep. The garden was soon flattened by trucks digging a well to
pump water into the foundational piers that are a chronic problem
for many historic Back Bay buildings constructed on fill. Then,
after many meetings, the garden was replanted. Then they had to
build a wheelchair ramp in 1997. Britton has now developed skill at
heeling in temporarily displaced shrubbery and then replanting it.
</P>
<P>
   When in 1995 the rector and his gardening wife moved away,
Britton inherited primary responsibility for the garden, under Kenn
Stephens, director of the Advent's Flower Arranging and Garden
Guild. This meant not only weeding but moving sprinklers around and
turning them on on her way to work each summer morning and then
calling the church so someone else would turn the water off.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteer help always proved surprisingly hard to find, so
Britton, who lives near the church, discovered it was quicker to do
the weeding herself than to ``make the phone calls to coordinate a
work crew to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the garden has become an important part of the community
over the last decade and things have gotten easier. Now there's an
automatic irrigation system. And the church has started hiring
gardening help at key times of year ``so I don't have to spend my
whole life weeding. The garden is valued by the church now, and
it's in the budget, not just dependent on donations.''
</P>
<P>
   The shady nooks burst with color from April through June and
then recede into restful green the rest of the year. It is one of
the few public spaces on Beacon Hill, and Britton thinks it has
influenced more neighbors to beautify the fronts of their houses.
She should know. She's traded plants over the fence with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real challenge to urban gardening, but it's so
rewarding! Just see what's happening along Commonwealth Avenue and
Beacon Street! And it isn't like people are trying to outdo each
other. They're just trying to create proper city gardens. And I
think Mayor Menino has had a big effect. We've lived in the city 14
years and it just gets prettier and prettier.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to really intrepid people like Diane Britton.
</P>
<P>

St. Leonard's Church
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The roses of St. Leonard's Garden of Peace at the corner of
Prince and Hanover streets are to the eyes of this city what the
cannoli at Mike's Pastry are to its lips. And both are integral to
the North End's Italian identity.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how difficult it is to make cannoli, but St.
Leonard's has got to have the most labor-intensive church garden in
town, with 50 rosebushes and hundreds of annuals of cheerfully
mixed color and parentage surrounding still white statues of saints
and children. The statues are praying, but the flowers are dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and then there's Angelo DelPriore. He's neither praying nor
dancing. He's watering. He loves the garden but, well, feels a bit
put upon. ``I have to be there seven nights a week. I spend at
least 20 to 25 hours a week weeding and watering, pinching back the
annuals, and trimming the roses. I'm a CPA with a full-time job,
but I squeeze it in. I work in the area. Sometimes I go over for
lunch and pinch (the flowers) a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   A volunteer, or more accurately the volunteer, DelPriori spends
two hours a day hand-watering so the thousands of tourists who come
through don't get soaked by sprinklers. (Here's a man who does
things right, no matter what the personal cost.) ``I've had several
tourists from Texas and Tennessee, gardeners who said it was
incredible that one person takes care of this garden.''
</P>
<P>
   It was begun by one of the parish priests during the Vietnam War
25 years ago as a gesture toward returning veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Now one side of it is sinking because it was built over a cellar
hole that was not properly filled in. Talk about the vicissitudes
of urban gardening! If your foundation piers aren't drying out and
rotting, your garden is falling into a cellar hole.
</P>
<P>
   St. Leonard's wants to mount a fund-raising campaign to restore
the garden.
</P>
<P>
   I have no doubt that any congregation with the brio to plant a
church garden of annuals will raise all the money it needs. Annuals
are the most work of any type of gardening because they must be
constantly watered, fertilized, pinched, and dead-headed. But if
they are, they produce constant color. St. Leonard's blazes with
snapdragons, zinnias, and coleus. Annuals are also employed because
each fall the garden can be stripped of plants and the precious
open space used for a Christmas Nativity scene.

WHAT DID THE `AUTOMOBILIST' SAY TO THE FIDGETY HORSE? 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Writing about cars, and loving cars, is a lot like writing about
baseball, or loving baseball.
</P>
<P>
   I look with a delightful sense of hope toward the future _ and
with all the changes electronic on the horizon, those changes will
compound like interest owed a loan shark; yet I am also, as
Fitzerald said of Gatsby, drawn inexorably to the past.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is why a new book by Will Anderson, a Maine writer,
caught my eye. The last book of his I read was called ``Was
Baseball Really Invented in Maine?'' and it was a fascinating
record of minor-league ball and major-league players with ties to
that state. Now comes Anderson with another book about _ you
guessed it _ cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``You Auto See Maine'' is a wonderful romp through one state's
cultural car history.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson chronicles auto dealers and their offerings, come and
gone, or still with us; he gives us great dry jokes infused with
Maine logic and humor, and news accounts that reflect the ascent of
this newfangled machine, the automobile, on the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   It is a book set in Maine, but it is a book that could have been
written in any state.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, advice given by a newspaper columnist on what an
``automobilist'' should do when encountering a horse: ``Stop the
vehicle and, if the horse is frightened, turn off the engine. If
there is any difficulty, the driver of the automobile should lead
the horse himself or have him led past the automobile.'' Keep a
human between the car and the beast, he continued, and if the horse
remains fidgety, say, ``Whoa.''
</P>
<P>
   In a news account from the Portland Daily Advertiser of December
1903, a meeting of the Brewer City Council is reported. The purpose
of the meeting was to discuss ``good roads,'' but our correspondent
noted ``after they had got at the topic they found that there were
no good roads to discuss, and so they changed the subject to bad
roads.''
</P>
<P>
   We learn that on Middle Street in Lewiston in 1905 you could buy
a Jackson, five-passenger Model C with perfect balance and perfect
alignment, sold under the slogan ``No sand too deep, No hills too
steep.'' Anybody seen a Jackson lately?
</P>
<P>
   We learn that in 1924 _ I see a trend here _ the Forest City
Filling Station in Portland installed an automobile vacuum cleaner
. . . useful in getting all the dust out of closed car
upholstery.'' Could the car wash be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   And finally, for those who want to reach out and touch a bit of
the old car culture, Anderson offers up tangible relics of that
past: diners and drive-in theatres.
</P>
<P>
   ``For diners, there's the Palace in Biddeford (Maine's oldest
diner, opened in 1927), the Deluxe in Rumford (in operation since
1928), the Miss Portland . . . and the Brunswick. There's also the
storied Moody's in Waldoboro and the Maine Diner in Wells.
</P>
<P>
   ``For drive-in theatres, there's the Saco Drive-In (opened in
1939 and one of the oldest extant drive-ins in the world), the
Skowhegan, Prides Corner in Westbrook, the Bridgton, and, way
upstate, the Skylite, in Madawaska.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who besides baseball has written books about beer,
roadside delights, cafes, and old-time Maine, strikes a chord with
this book on autos, if only because its snappy recount of news and
humor, its use of old ads and photos, allows any who read it to be
drawn inexorably to the past. And surely, all auto enthusiasts
enjoy looking into the rear-view mirror on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You Auto See Maine'' is available from Anderson &AMP; Sons'
Publishing Co., 34 Park St., Bath, Maine 04530.

   John White, who has left this space, has not left the world of
automobiles, and he recently spent time chasing some of the steam
cars that made ascents up Mount Washington.
</P>
<P>
   White writes to us:
</P>
<P>
   It was the ultimate game of King 'O the Hill and the British
won, 3-2, scoring an automotive first in the process _ afather-son-in-law team driving two steam cars in succession to the
top of Mount Washington in a single day.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Aug. 13, Basil Craske of Norfolk, England, piloted
his Like-A-Mobile (a replica of a 1903 Locomobile) to the
6,288-foot summit in an hour and 10 minutes. He was accompanied by
his father-in-law, John Liming, also of Norfolk. After a brief
celebration, both descended in a modern car, and Liming, assisted
by Craske, drove his 1911 Stanley up the mountain in less than half
the time of the '03, finishing with an astonishing burst of speed
up the final stretch of 22-percent grade to the top. Liming built
both cars, incorporating original parts.
</P>
<P>
   In the interval between those ascents, Gerry Stoneman, of
Tiverton Devon, England, reached the peak in a 1922 Stanley _ three
of the six British-owned steamers shipped from the United Kingdom
for this event made it to the summit. Only two of 79 American-owned
steamers got to the top in the weeklong celebration of the
centennial of the first car up Mount Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Four years in the planning, the commemoration and weeklong steam
tour were organized by the Stanley Museum, Kingfield, Maine, with
major support from the Mount Washington Auto Road Co., owner of the
road to the summit. The event attracted 85 steamers _ mostly
Stanleys _ and 300 museum members from four continents.
</P>
<P>
   The British drivers spent about $27,000 of their own money, plus
about $7,500 put up by the Auto Road Co. and Audi, official car of
the road, to transport their steamers across the Atlantic for the
celebration.

DVRS ARE BEING TOUTED AS A TV REVOLUTION

<TEXT>
<P>
   Most hot new companies insist their product is going to change
the world, but two California start-ups promising to revolutionize
the way people watch television are beginning to attract a lot of
believers.
</P>
<P>
   Their revolution, as measured by sales of so-called digital
video recorders, hasn't really begun yet. But the companies' goal
of using computer hard drives to give people greater control over
their TV viewing _ including instant replays, putting live TV on
hold, and recording shows all year long with one click of the
remote _ has shaken up the broadcasting world and spawned
soul-searching about the future of TV.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, some of the biggest names in the
entertainment and Internet world have showered millions of dollars
on the two companies selling DVRs, TiVo Inc. of Sunnyvale and
Replay Networks of Mountain View. WebTV, owned by Microsoft, is
expected to enter the market later this year in an alliance with
satellite broadcaster Dish Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's caught everyone in the industry by surprise,'' said Peg
Murphy, vice president of business development for NBC Interactive,
which has invested millions of dollars in both TiVo and Replay
Networks. ``It's one of the few interactive TV applications to come
along in the last few years that makes sense because it actually
makes watching TV easier.''
</P>
<P>
   The bugs are still being worked out of the technology, but there
is a growing buzz about how DVRs will allow consumers to escape the
straitjacket of network schedules and possibly avoid TV
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to make a complete change in the way people
watch TV,'' said Josh Bernoff, TV analyst at Forrester Research in
Cambridge, Mass. ``What you're seeing here is the beginning of an
enormous change in the way TV works.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a videocassette recorder, a digital video recorder records
and plays back TV shows, but without tapes or any complicated
programming. All you need to know is the name of the show; there's
no need to know when it's on or the channel. A couple of clicks
with the remote and it's done. You can direct the machine to record
the show every time it comes on. It even sets its own clock.
</P>
<P>
   The digital video recorder captures the incoming TV signal,
compresses it, and records it on a computer hard drive. The machine
plugs into a telephone jack and downloads up-to-date channel
lineups for the coming two weeks in the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   DVR users can view a show from its beginning while it's
recording, unlike users of a videocassette recorder, who must wait
until a recording is done to start watching. Say you want to record
the ``Sopranos'' on HBO at 9 p.m. on Wednesday and watch it that
same night, but the children aren't put to bed until 9:30. Just
click on the ``Sopranos'' when the house is finally quiet and start
watching from the beginning while the DVR continues to record the
end.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you're not recording a show, the digital video recorder
is always recording some of whatever show is being watched. That
can come in handy. Say you're watching a live broadcast of a
baseball game and your mother calls. You can hit pause, take the
call, and later resume watching where you left off. Or you can hit
instant replay and watch Nomar Garciaparra make a play at shortstop
again. DVRs put the viewer in charge.
</P>
<P>
   The first reaction of most people is that a DVR is nothing more
than a souped-up, computerized VCR without the capability of
playing taped movies. Reviewers so far have liked the technology
but been turned off by the price.
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from $500 to $1,500, depending on the recording
capacity, which runs from eight to 30 hours using the poorest
recording quality. Recording capacity drops dramatically as the
quality of the recording _ or the amount of data recorded _ is
increased. TiVo and WebTV also have monthly subscription fees of
$9.95 and $24.95, respectively, although TiVo offers a lifetime
subscription for $199.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety percent of US homes have VCRs, but the machines haven't
really changed the way people watch TV. Only a third of VCR users
tape a TV show at least once a week, and just under a third never
tape anything, according to a survey released earlier this year by
the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts think DVRs will change that and end up
changing TV in the process. They think DVRs will become portals to
television, much the way America Online, one of many TiVo
investors, has become a major access point for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of watching live TV, consumers may increasingly select
shows they want to watch days or weeks in advance and use their
DVRs to watch them whenever they want. The TiVo machine monitors
your viewing habits and records shows it thinks you might like.
ReplayTV allows users to customize their own networks around a
theme or a favorite actor.
</P>
<P>
   Bernoff of Forrester Research predicts DVRs will be the
fastest-growing consumer electronics product in history, with four
out of five homes having one within 10 years. The impact on TV will
be enormous, he says. ``Primetime'' could become increasingly
irrelevant as more shows get recorded for later viewing, while
middle-of-the-night time slots could become hot properties in an
environment where time-delay TV is the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Bernoff's boldest prediction is that the millions of people who
will watch TV on a DVR will skip through the commercials, knocking
the economic pins out from under the broadcast networks. Certainly
DVRs make it easy: ReplayTV lets the user skip forward in 30-second
increments, while TiVo offers a high-speed fast forward. A decade
from now, Bernoff predicts, ad viewing will be cut in half, as
consumers decide it's more efficient to watch NBC's three-hour
Thursday night lineup in two hours and 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ent of Boston, who bought a TiVo DVR, says the ease of
recording has changed his viewing habits. He now records his
favorite shows and watches them whenever he wants, almost always
zapping through the ads. ``I'm sort of out of sync now with live
TV,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is convinced. Karen Agresti, senior vice
president and director of broadcasting at Hill, Holliday, Connors,
Cosmopulos, said the same gloom-and-doom network scenarios were
popular when VCRs came on the market. ``This is technically not a
new idea,'' she said. ``The majority of people still watch shows
when they air.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Ryan, the head of Pro Media Inc., a Natick, Mass.
media-buying firm, says it will be hard to change entrenched
viewing habits. ``That's really not how people view TV,'' she said
of the DVR time-shifting philosophy. ``And, besides, some people
like to watch the commercials.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy at NBC Interactive said the network continues to believe
programming will be ad-based, but she acknowledges it may not
revolve around 30- or 60-second spots five years from now. ``We
don't think this is going to be revolutionary overnight,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that media titans like NBC, CBS, Showtime, Walt Disney,
Time Warner, Liberty Media, Comcast Corp., and Cox Communications
are investing in TiVo and Replay Networks may have an impact on the
debate. Officials at TiVo and Replay Networks are downplaying their
machines' ad-zapping capabilities and stressing a willingness to
work with broadcasters and the advertising industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to give viewers more control, but we're very sensitive
to the business issues of our partners,'' said Stacy Jolna, vice
president of programming and media partnerships at TiVo. ``There is
a happy medium there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Jolna says, the onus will be on advertisers to make
sure people continue to watch their ads. General Motors, for
example, is working with TiVo on targeting ads at specific TiVo
owners. In other words, GM might run an Oldsmobile ad during ``60
Minutes,'' but as TiVo users replay the show at a later time GM
might substitute ads that would be more appropriate for each user.
Families might see a minivan ad, while singles might see an ad for
a sports car.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone acknowledges that DVR technology and programming
is in its infancy. Recording time is limited, channel switching is
sluggish, and DVRs make an annoying, crackling computer sound
constantly. But improvements are expected. In less than two years,
Bernoff predicts that a machine with 24 hours of recording time
will cost less than $500. The machines themselves could disappear
as the technology is incorporated into cable TV set-top boxes and
satellite broadcast receivers, and coupled with on-screen Internet
access.

BMW'S NEW STATION WAGON INSPIRES CONFIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time when the station wagon was the minivan or the
SUV of American car culture. That time was in the 1950s, when the
big family wagon was a symbol of comfortable suburban life: haul
the kids to Little League games, haul the family on vacations.
</P>
<P>
   America was on the move and families were on the move _ in their
wagons.
</P>
<P>
   How things change. Today, minivans, SUVs, and four-door pickup
trucks, purchased with the idea of carrying family, gear, and
goods, rule. Yet the station wagon is making a subtle comeback, and
it is coming from unexpected quarters: foreign luxury car makers.
</P>
<P>
   While Taurus, Sable, and Saturn continue to crank out wagons in
what for them is a shrinking domestic market, BMW, Saab, Mercedes,
Volvo, and Audi all offer new wagons. Subaru has long been a solid
player at the lower end of this niche. BMW will add a 3 Series
wagon early next year to move toward the lower end of the market.
At the upper end, there are rumors that Jaguar has a wagon on the
drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   None of what's out there will haul the goods and passengers that
a big SUV or minivan will haul; these are more like the smaller
SUVS _ such as Toyota 4-Runner _ in their capacities.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of them is the BMW wagon, available in the 528i and 540i
models _ 6 and 8 cylinders respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days in the 528i _ five-speed manual transmission _ revealed
it to have more in common with luxury sports sedans than the
classic notion of a station wagon. Yet there was all that space
behind.
</P>
<P>
   It drives like a luxury sports sedan because, excepting the box
that is its rear end, that's what it is. It rides on typically
stiff and nimble BMW suspension: struts, coil springs, twin-tube
gas shocks, and antiroll bars up front; 4-link integral suspension
with coil springs, twin tube gas shocks, and antiroll bar in the
rear.
</P>
<P>
   The disc brakes, front and rear, are nearly a foot in diameter,
and when the aluminum calipers clamp onto them, the car comes to
sure, straight, and sudden stops.
</P>
<P>
   Dynamic stability sytems aid both in keeping traction just right
and in braking.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-cylinder aluminum block engine cranks out nearly 200
horsepower and makes the car most responsive as you work the
five-speed transmission with a moderate-throw, relatively stiff
shift lever.
</P>
<P>
   With much of my travel done on highways, the car got about 24
miles per gallon _ quite respectable given its powerful
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, this is a car that inspires confidence. Stomp the gas,
and a controlled rumble moves right up through the seats. This is a
tight car and a quiet car.
</P>
<P>
   The multifacted, stiff suspension means that the 528i provides
some moderate jarring on bumpy roads, yet the swap is that on
smoother, faster roads it is remarkably firm and free of
side-to-side lean when passing, and it clings to corners with
almost no body roll. It is so well-balanced, in fact, that it is
subtly fast, and at least twice it crept up to 90 miles per hour by
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Its traction-control system was effective, though a little
annoying in that it kicked in _ and chirped a warning _ far earlier
than I felt it needed to.
</P>
<P>
   Though the 528i is billed as a five-passenger car, when the
passengers are adults, it is really more suitable for just four.
Even three young children on the rear bench seat got antsy and
feeling crowded on a four-hour drive.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that this wagon is a luxury beast abounds on the
inside: leather on the dash; leather trim on the doors; broad, firm
leather seats that adjust electrically and can be programmed to
remember who you are and how you like your seat set.
</P>
<P>
   Storage space is only adequate _ door bins are thin, a tiny
rolltop bin opens in the console between the front seats (I wonder
now what takes up all the space beneath the top of the console.)
</P>
<P>
   Typical of BMW, the gauges _ bathed at night in that wonderful
orange glow _ are simple but useful. Tachometer, speedometer, and
other gauges are clearly visible through the upper spokes of the
steering wheel. Four of the five windows that sit below these
gauges are dark, except when they flash a warning _ door open,
problems with lights _ while the fifth is an electronic font of
information that can be scrolled by using a button on a stem off
the steering column. It tells you, in sequence, mileage on the car,
mileage on a particular trip, outside temperature, average fuel
consumed, how many miles to go before fuel is gone, and average
speed for your trip.
</P>
<P>
   Buttons built into the steering wheel operate cellular phone,
radio, cruise control, and can switch air supply from outside to
recirculate.
</P>
<P>
   In the heat of day, or cold of night, zoned climate control lets
each front-seat passenger get as hot or cold as they want.
</P>
<P>
   The rear of the car is easily accessible through a lift-up
hatch. The flat floor makes loading and unloading easy (a nifty
roll-out floor that extends like a table is an intriguing option)
and cargo cover and luggage net keep loads contained.
</P>
<P>
   The rear seats fold down, and for two people on, say, a long
weekend of antiquing, this would be a comfortable, useful auto.
</P>
<P>
   If the load gets too heavy on the rear springs, those gas shocks
sense the load and pneumatic pressure is applied to bring the rear
end up to its normal height.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The finger-wheel operation of the dash vents that control the
flow of air.
</P>
<P>
   --The way the front seat rises as you move it forward with the
controls, the assumption being that if you need to be closer to the
pedals, you are probably also a bit shorter and could use the extra
boost.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The cup holders, which look like an afterthought and are
virtually useless. They emerge from the dash less than a half-inch
from the platform on which a drink rests _ and that means they hold
nothing effectively.
</P>
<P>
   --The rear-view mirrors _ way too small. Coming down an entrance
ramp, I found myself hunching my face forward of the steering wheel
to find traffic approaching from behind.

SMEAR VICTIM FIGHTS BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why does Jack E. White insist on using his pulpit in Time
magazine to squirt racial poison into the nation's public
discourse? When he chooses to, he can write columns that are
thoughtful and humane; a piece he did earlier this year on Jesse
Jackson's penchant for negotiating with dictators was a fine and
sensitive piece of work.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to politics, White pens some of the ugliest
commentary around. A favorite brand of venom is to accuse political
conservatives of being racists. Mind you, he never offers actual
evidence that they are racists; it is enough for him that they are
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, when the New Liberty Baptist Church in Alabama was torched
in 1996, White wrote this:
</P>
<P>
   ``All the conservative Republicans from Newt Gingrich to Pete
Wilson . . . should come stand in the charred ruins . . . and
wonder if their coded phrases encouraged the arsonists.'' Burning
churches? Blame the GOP. ``There is already enough evidence to
indict the cynical conservatives who build their political careers,
George Wallace-style, on a foundation of race-baiting. They may not
start fires, but they fan the flames.''
</P>
<P>
   White has suggested that Clarence Thomas is ``an intellectual
slave'' who is ``lavishly rewarded for serving . . . conservative
white Republicans.'' Newt Gingrich is ``one scary white man . . .
one very scary white man.'' He has mocked ``Newt the slasher, Bill
the waffler, and Jesse (Helms) the crank'' as ``white men who make
black people uneasy.'' In February, he wrote that the GOP
resurgence after 1964 was built on ``opposition to civil rights.''
Republicans might be ``too genteel for a sheet-wearing bigot like
David Duke but (are) all too willing to embrace bigotry if it's
dressed in a suit and tie.''
</P>
<P>
   White and Time get away with this stuff because the victims of
these smears never fight back. Until now.
</P>
<P>
   In Time's Aug. 30 edition, White wrote about David Horowitz, a
noted conservative activist. In the '60s, Horowitz was a militant
radical; famously, he later had second thoughts and moved to the
political right. A prolific writer, Horowitz has dissected the
cruel and antidemocratic instincts of ``progressives'' in several
riveting books, among them ``Destructive Generation'' and ``The
Politics of Bad Faith.'' He operates a lively Web site, Front Page,
and runs (with Peter Collier) the Center for the Study of Popular
Culture, which publishes Heterodoxy, a journal on political
correctness.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Horowitz also finds the time to generate a fortnightly
column for the liberal Web magazine Salon. On Aug. 16, he wrote
about the NAACP's plans to sue gun manufacturers on the grounds
that firearms are a leading cause of death among young black men,
who are nearly five times as likely to die of bullet wounds as
young white men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I alone,'' Horowitz wondered, ``in thinking this a
pathetic, absurd, and almost hilarious demonstration of political
desperation by the civil-rights establishment?''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to lacerate the leftist mindset that holds that
``there cannot be a wound the black community inflicts on itself
that is not ultimately the responsibility of malicious whites.'' If
nearly half the prison population is black, Horowitz wrote, ``that
cannot be allowed to suggest that the black community have a
problem when it comes to raising its children as law-abiding. . . .
Oh, no. Such a statistic can only be explained by the racism of
(the) criminal justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a blunt and angry column. Perhaps Horowitz's ire was
fueled by his lifelong passion for civil rights, which began 51
years ago at a demonstration against job discrimination. Perhaps it
was fueled by the work he has done for charities that concentrate
on at-risk minority kids _ Operation Hope, School on Wheels,
Angel's Flight. Perhaps it was fueled by the same commitment that
led him to invite five leading black figures to a conservative
conclave, ``to tell Republicans,'' as he put it, ``that they were
not doing enough for African-Americans and other minorities.''
Perhaps it was fueled by his love for his black daughter-in-law and
his three granddaughters.
</P>
<P>
   Well, White read the column and came to a different conclusion.
His usual conclusion. The column ``reminded'' him that ``blatant
bigotry is alive and well'' on the Internet, even at liberal
Webzines. He pronounced Horowitz guilty of a ``blanket assault''
that outdid ``the antiblack rantings'' of other conservatives.
Worst of all was the headline: ``A Real, Live Bigot.''
</P>
<P>
   White's accusation is scurrilous. But the damage such a libel
can wreak is massive. ``To be labeled a `bigot,' particularly in
the wake of Buford Furrow, is a verbal death sentence,'' Horowitz
says. ``That column is a calculated attempt to prevent anyone from
ever again listening to what I have to say.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not taking it passively. He fired off a blistering letter
to Time, demanding an apology. He posted an appeal for support and
his letter to Time _ on Front Page (www.frontpagemag.com). He is
talking to lawyers about a libel suit. In short, he is making a
stink. If more conservatives did that when they are slandered as
racists and bigots, maybe the slanders would stop.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Horowitz has no intention of censoring himself to
please the Jack E. Whites of the world. His forthcoming book, due
in November, is titled ``Hating Whitey and Other Professive
Causes.''

OPENING THE DOOR TO HAPPINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every time you follow your heart, you open a door. Every door
you open reveals a world you never dreamed existed.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't believe me, listen to this.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, my friend John Ruggiero received a sport kite as a
gift. He set out for Nahant Beach, and before he knew it, the other
kite fliers were sharing everything they knew about putting a kite
through its tricks, and he was hooked. That's not the end of the
story.
</P>
<P>
   It's just the turning of the doorknob.
</P>
<P>
   John gave a sermon on flying kites at our Unitarian-Universalist
Church. He described the as-yet-unsuspected world he entered when
he sent that first tethered creature up into the sky. This is what
he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never much of a dancer. I'm about as graceful on my feet
as a water buffalo. Flying that dual-line kite was like dancing,
but no one was looking at me. They were watching my kite. People
would stop by while I was flying my kite and walk away smiling. I
smiled a lot too. I have flown kites during snowstorms, and I
wasn't alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a video of a professional kite flier flying a kite in a
gym. There were no fans and no wind. It looked like fun, so I
decided to try to fly a kite indoors to music. It took most of the
day to learn to keep the kite in the air for 45 seconds. The kite,
which is very light in weight, is pretty much flown by thought
alone. I let my feelings just flow up the lines and watch, as
amazed as the audience, as the kite interprets the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I flew a kite inside the Newport, R.I., Marriott lobby to Sara
McLachlan's song `Angel,' and when the crowd applauded, I had tears
in my eyes. I didn't want the song to end. Indoor flying removes
the limits of the wind and makes the kite a part of you. I could
never imagine myself dancing in front of people, but flying a kite
indoors lets me soar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also ride a kite-powered buggy, which is a three-wheeled
stainless steel cart that you steer with your feet. I've had some
of my most spiritual experiences while on a buggy. Sometimes birds
follow the kite, and I admire the ease with which they fly.
Sometimes there is no one around at Nahant Beach and the sounds of
the ocean are all I hear. Sometimes I ride at night and watch my
kite cruise the stars while I listen to the music of the sea. One
night, in Wildwood, N.J., I looked down to see the green glow of
phosphorus trailing my wheels. I felt like I was riding a comet. In
the desert, we push 50 miles an hour on these things.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some real danger involved. People like me are just
good enough to be dangerous. I'm learning tricks like riding on two
wheels, riding backward, and spinning. After destroying four
bicycle helmets, I wear a kayaking helmet that is designed for
multiple impacts. I guess I sometimes feel a little too close to
God on a buggy.''
</P>
<P>
   John travels on business, but hardly ever needs to buy dinner.
Instead, he contacts other kite fliers through the Internet and
accepts their invitations to eat with them and fly kites together _
in British Columbia, Belgium, and throughout the United States.
He's come to the conclusion that the best people in the world are
the ones at the end of the strings.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does this insanity qualify as a spiritual experience?'' he
asks. ``There is a vast community of people who care deeply for one
another. We are dependent on the blending of earth, air, and water,
along with the fires of our passion and the sun. We help one
another and work for charity. We find peace and tranquillity in the
harmony of the lines singing in the wind. We play. We dance for the
joy of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything I've done has made me feel more for those around
me, it is kite flying. It has opened my eyes to the beauty of the
beach, the open field, and the desert. I've learned to respect
people for their skills and learn from them. I've found unqualified
support and friendship. After a while, spending time with the
people at the beach became as important to me as flying the kites.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a Chinese tradition of a flying kite representing the
evil spirits in your life. You cut the lines and the evil spirits
float away. At the end of the day, I can take all the evil spirits
from disease, work, and frustration and, like the Chinese, make
them fly away while my kite dances in the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   For John, a passion for kites was the key that opened the door
to a new kind of freedom in his life. It brought him noncompetitive
friendships with other men and women and taught him a new way of
communing with nature. I believe that an infinite number of keys
open an infinite number of doors to an infinite number of fully
elaborated, life-giving, mind-blowing realities.
</P>
<P>
   This is the secret of happiness: Just choose one.

WE HAVE SEEN THE FUTURE AND IT IS . . . RIPPLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What one item would you like to have on hand if you were
stranded on a desert island? Water? Food? Matches? A knife? Beer? A
cell phone? A solar-powered TV?
</P>
<P>
   If you are like 49 percent of people recently surveyed by the
Kimberly-Clark Corp., the one thing you couldn't survive without on
a desert island is toilet paper.
</P>
<P>
   I learned this from a press release sent along to promote a new
feature of Kleenex Cottonelle toilet paper. Cushy Ripples have been
added. That's right. Cushy Ripples, designed with a ``patented
technology'' to make you feel . . . special. According to the press
release, Cottonelle with Cushy Ripples is _ trumpet flourish,
please _ ``The Toilet Paper of the 21st Century.''
</P>
<P>
   The relase continues, ``We can only imagine what the next 100
years holds in store for toilet paper. Just like our grandparents
and great-grandparents probably never would have pictured toilet
paper as it is  &UR; today &LR; , it's hard to envision what it will be like
in the new millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people worry about the Y2K problem, others worry about the
future of toilet paper. And which is more important, really?
Kimberly-Clark asked those surveyed if they thought toilet paper
would change in the next 100 years. Only one-third said they
believed it would change ``very little.'' What about the other
two-thirds, the toilet paper visionaries? What did they foresee?
Virtual toilet paper? Diagnostic toilet paper? Interactive toilet
paper? Shouldn't we be told?
</P>
<P>
   The survey also revealed that we take toilet paper for granted.
It topped the list of ``small but important conveniences of the
20th century that most people take for granted but can't live
without,'' coming in ahead of the zipper, frozen foods, the paper
clip, and hair spray.
</P>
<P>
   Hair spray? People can't live without hair spray? Where did they
conduct this survey? Dallas?
</P>
<P>
   But back to the subject at hand. We may take toilet paper for
granted, but it is never far from our thoughts. On another page of
the press release, under the heading ``Toilet Paper Tidbits,'' is
the following fascinating factoid: ``Running out of toilet paper is
one of the biggest concerns in American households. The average
family has eight rolls in reserve to make sure there are no
emergencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Only eight rolls? I never feel secure unless I have a stash of
at least 20, and I've never thought of myself as above average,
except maybe when it comes to changing rolls of toilet paper. It
used to annoy me that I was the only person in my house capable of
finding and installing a new roll of toilet paper. Now, after
reading this press release, it gives me a strange feeling of power.
</P>
<P>
   Under the heading ``The History of Toilet Paper Rolls Into the
21st Century,'' the press release provides a capsule chronology of
toilet tissue evolution. In prehistoric times, leaves and sticks
served the purpose, although geography affected the material of
choice, to wit, ``Mussel shells were popular in coastal regions,
and people who lived in tropical climates probably used coconut
shells.''
</P>
<P>
   You can well imagine how those folks would have appreciated a
few Cushy Ripples.
</P>
<P>
   The brief history skips forward to the Renaissance, when
``royalty were known to have used wool or lace,'' then on to
Colonial America, when ``corn cobs and newspaper were among the top
choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Did Colonial women worry about running out of corn cobs?
Probably. We must be grateful to be alive on the cusp of the
millennium, at the dawn of a New Age of toilet paper technology.
Who knows what the future will bring? Thanks, Kimberly-Clark, for
sharing.

BACK-TO-SCHOOL BLUES SHOULD PASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If your child has nothing to say when she comes home from the
first day of school, if she's so tired she wants to lie down, of
all things, it's not because they ran her ragged in phys ed. She's
emotionally exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Any child starting a new year typically sets off on the first
morning feeling grown up to be in a new grade and excited to see
friends. She's also likely worried about any number of things, from
whom she'll sit next to to how strict the teacher will be.
</P>
<P>
   With any luck, the first day goes well enough; maybe the second
one does, too. But the honeymoon has to end sometime, typically by
the fifth day. That's when exhilaration turns to apprehension: Back
to school isn't just for one day or one week, (itals)it's for nine
whole long months.(unitals) It isn't just for fun, it's tests and
homework and projects and friends who aren't friends after all and
(itals)what if I can't do the work?(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   In the first two weeks of school, worries like these are normal,
says child psychologist Gil Noam; after all, kids are rusty from a
summer of non-academics, and it's hard to settle back into school
routines. He tells parents to expect that most children, including
those in upper elementary and middle-school grades, will exhibit
some out-of-the-ordinary behavior during these weeks, from
aggression to regression.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, how out of the ordinary does it have to be for
us to do something about it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it happen once or twice and then diminish, or does it
become more frequent, more intense?'' asks Noam, a professor at the
Harvard Graduate School of Education. He considers the first two
weeks a wait-and-see period, when we need to be supportive, not
panicky. ``By the end of Week 2, if it starts to wane, it was a
transitional blip. Let it go,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Week 3 watershed
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Week 3, however, anything not tapering off deserves
attention; by Week 4, action. Before we can do anything, however,
we need to know that something's wrong. Unfortunately, children
don't always know and can't always tell us what's troubling them.
We need to look instead at their behavior:
</P>
<P>
   --Physiological complaints. With children under 8, anxiety tends
to manifest itself physically, says developmental psychologist Amy
Susman-Stillman, coordinator of the Children, Youth and Family
Consortium at the University of Minnesota. Look for anything from
headaches and stomachaches to not eating or sleeping well, or any
other complaint that is not typical of this child and intensifies
over time. Sympathy is appropriate, but in the absence of a fever
or other serious symptoms, send him to school anyway, lest you feed
into school phobia.
</P>
<P>
   --Regression. Thumb-sucking, bed-wetting, nail-biting, and
crying are also common in early elementary ages. With a fourth
grader or older, you may see cranky behavior that reminds you of a
temper tantrum, excessive dawdling before school, extreme
irritability after school, and sleep difficulty. ``You may even
notice that he's frequently tearing up, or maybe he leaves the room
so you don't see him cry,'' says Ann E. LaForge, author of ``What
Really Happens in School'' (Hyperion).
</P>
<P>
   Regression tends to pass within weeks. Assume this is a symptom
of anxiety and don't make a big deal out of the behavior; that
obscures the real issue. ``Set appropriate limits around
inappropriate behavior,'' says LaForge, ``but go gentler on
discipline: `You seem really out of sorts. Why don't you take some
time to think about what will help you feel better?' ''
</P>
<P>
   --Sibling squabbles. Children of all ages tend to take their
frustrations about school out on siblings, says pediatric and
family psychologist Peter Goldenthal. If fights increase from one
or two a day to five or six; if they are not just about one
specific thing (``He's teasing me about my hair again!'') but about
anything and everything, including issues that a week ago wouldn't
have gotten any reaction; and if you need to intervene all the
time, that's likely what's happening. What the squabbles look like
can tell you a lot. ``If he picks on one sibling in particular
every time he sits down to read or do his homework _ `You're
turning into a nerd!' _ he could be anxious about some aspect of
his own academic achievement,'' says Goldenthal. He is the author
of ``Beyond Sibling Rivalry'' (Henry Holt).
</P>
<P>
   --Accelerated aggression. You may not see this firsthand, but
you may hear about it, either via a note from the teacher (somewhat
unusual this early in the year), or indirectly from the child: His
shirt is torn not once but two or three times because he ``got into
a fight'' (not his fault); he talks about school but not about the
work or the teacher; homework is ``stupid,'' school is ``boring'';
friends don't call to play. If you were in the classroom, you'd see
him picking a fight as class breaks into study groups or during a
particular subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a teacher at the start of a year, this looks like
defiance,'' says Susman-Stillman. Her research shows something
else, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aggression often is a diversionary tactic,'' she says.
``There's something he doesn't feel competent about, so he acts up
to take attention away from the fact that he can't do it.'' In the
first few weeks and especially if there's no history of aggression
or it's more intense than usual, she suggests translating what's
going on: `` `I don't know how to do this work and I don't know how
to tell you that I don't know how.' ''
</P>
<P>
   --Withdrawn behavior. This is the trickiest clue, especially in
a preteen who typically wants more privacy. ``Just because she does
her homework in her room and not at the kitchen table doesn't mean
she's trying to hide that she can't do the work,'' says
Susman-Stillman. But it could be, if she is also less involved with
friends, uncharacteristically unenthusiastic about school, looking
for other ways to be alone, and easily upset.
</P>
<P>
   When young children withdraw, it's frequently because something
scares them, like a bully on the bus. ``They don't complain because
they're afraid of getting into trouble, so they shut down,'' says
LaForge.
</P>
<P>
   --Relational aggression. The fourth- to seventh-grade girl who
seems to be purposefully mean so that friendships are in turmoil
may be struggling socially, academically, or both: If she feels out
of it socially, she typically can't concentrate on the work. But,
says Susman-Stillman, ``She doesn't realize what she's doing. She's
upset and acting on it without knowing it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Time for action
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When any of the above symptoms stretch into Week 3 or 4, it's
time to take action. With a first- to third-grader, the strategy
Susman-Stillman prefers is to tell a story about your child, but in
the third person: `` `There was once a first grader who came home
from school every day feeling sad and mopey and picking fights with
her sister. But when her mother asked what was wrong, she just
didn't know.' What advice would you give that mother?'' LaForge
tells parents to be supportive _ ``It seems like you're feeling
lonely this year, without Jennifer in your class. Is there anyone
you sort of like and want to invite over?'' _ but not to overreact:
``It makes me so angry that you and Jennifer aren't together!''
</P>
<P>
   With an older child, Goldenthal recommends ``nurturant
confrontation'': ``Let him know you sense something is wrong: `I
love you, you're a great kid, but the way you're behaving just
isn't you. What's going on?' ''
</P>
<P>
   That will get some children to open up but prompt others to tell
you to leave them alone. Now comes the confrontational part, says
Goldenthal: `` `If you tell me, `You're right, Dad, but I don't
want to talk now,' that's fine, I can wait. But I can tell you're
upset, and it's not fair to claim privacy and act this way. I love
you. I'm not going to give up, because maybe, just maybe, I can
help you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the behavior, Susman-Stillman and others urge
parents to call or send a teacher a note in Week 3 or 4: ``Just
want to check in and see if John is getting off on the right
foot.'' Do this even if your child is adjusting well. ``It tells
the teacher you care, and that's important,'' says LaForge.
</P>
<P>
   Noam urges: ``Don't wait for a crisis,'' and don't assume a
teacher will come to you this early in the year, even if he wonders
about something. More likely, he'll wait for the conference, which
means your child could suffer for months.

<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   A family task
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One way to head off problems before they begin is to make it
clear as school starts that there's a transition period not just
for each child but for the whole family. ``The more you approach it
as a family task, the less alone a child feels and the more willing
he is to communicate,'' says Noam.
</P>
<P>
   Planning a special family dinner for the first night of school,
for instance, or celebrating the end of the first week are ways not
only to give a child something to look forward to but also to build
in a structure for talking about school.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --By the fourth week, difficulty doing homework that goes beyond
the usual complaining can signal learning issues. Try some
adjustments _ modify the homework routine to break it up into
smaller pieces; find out from the teacher how long she expects
homework to take; see if he understands instructions _ and talk to
the teacher.
</P>
<P>
   --When a child doesn't want to go to school, be clear that is
not an option but also let him know you will work with him to solve
any problem. Let the teacher know he doesn't want to go.
</P>
<P>
   --Hold off on starting extracurricular activities until the
second month.
</P>
<P>
   --Feeling disorganized prevents a child from functioning well.
Does he have systems to deal with papers and assignments?
</P>
<P>
   --In middle school, self-esteem can plummet in the first weeks.
Take any sign of unhappiness even more seriously than you would
have in elementary school.

A DASH OF SEASONING CAN BRING OUT THE REAL TASTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Seasoning is everything. With little effort it
can take a dish from ho-hum to holy cow. It's just a matter of
knowing which seasonings work with which foods. That takes practice
and experience. Here are a few combinations to help you get
started:
</P>
<P>
   _ To jazz up a pot of corned beef and cabbage, add red pepper
flakes to pot before cooking.
</P>
<P>
   _ To give beef chili intensity, tie a few cloves and a bay leaf
into a cheesecloth bag and add to the pot before simmering.
</P>
<P>
   _ To add a depth of flavor to chocolate sauces, add a dash of
nutmeg.
</P>
<P>
   _ To bring out the sweetness of red bell peppers, add a bit of
kosher salt.
</P>
<P>
   _ Add fresh chopped parsley to fillings in lasagna, ravioli and
manicotti to bring out the flavors of the cheeses.
</P>
<P>
   _ Toss finely chopped fresh parsley or salt and pepper on green
salad to intensify the flavors of the vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   _ For fancy French toast, add vanilla extract and cinnamon to
the egg wash.
</P>
<P>
   _ For a little zip, add a dash of cayenne pepper to the flour
when frying chicken or fish.
</P>
<P>
   _ Add instant espresso powder to chocolate cakes or cookies to
give them an edge of coffee flavor.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make meringues with brown sugar instead of white for a
toastier flavor.

SQUASH IS NOW A YEAR-ROUND TREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (ED: With STORING-SQUASH.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Somehow along the way, summer and winter became
interchangeable. At least, they did if you determine the seasons by
the kind of squash you eat.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be in summer you ate zucchini, yellow crookneck
squash and the UFO-shaped pattypan squash. In winter, you ate acorn
squash and butternut squash. In the fall you ate potatoes and in
the spring you ate asparagus, you didn't eat squash.
</P>
<P>
   These days, you can buy acorn squash in August and zucchini in
January. Confusing, only if you're very strict about eating with
the seasons. Otherwise, you'll find having summer squash available
all year just widens your choices of dishes to serve.
</P>
<P>
   As vegetables go, squash is one of the easiest to prepare. They
don't require peeling, like potatoes can, or stringing like beans.
</P>
<P>
   Winter squashes, the ones that have hard rinds and cavities
filled with large seeds inside, can simply be halved, seeded and
baked to a glorious tenderness. To help retain moisture during
cooking, bake the squash halves cut side down. Once tender, you can
turn the squash over, brush the cut areas with butter and sprinkle
with brown sugar and cinnamon. Continue baking just until the sugar
has formed a glaze and serve in bowls with the pan juices.
</P>
<P>
   Summer squashes usually have thin skins and the seeds are small
enough to cook and eat. Perhaps the easiest way to prepare any type
of summer squash is to slice it and grill the pieces over a hot
fire. Drizzle the cooked slices with olive oil and sprinkle with
salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Squashes of either season can be seeded and stuffed such as in
the following recipe for Blue Cheese Pattypans. The trick with
these recipes is to partially cook the squash before stuffing so
you're not biting into hunks of raw vegetable when you get to the
middle of the squash. That's the thing about squash, it's not very
tasty if it hasn't been cooked through.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, here are a few recipes for cooking squash. No
matter what time of year it is.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BLUE CHEESE PATTYPANS
</P>
<P>
   (Makes 4 servings)
</P>
<P>
   Pattypans are a round, saucer-shaped summer squash variety. They
are sometimes available at farm stands and farmers markets. If
unavailable, substitute two zucchini, cutting them in half before
baking.
</P>
<P>
   4 large pattypan squash
</P>
<P>
   2 or 3 slices bacon
</P>
<P>
   1 cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   Heat oven to 350 degrees. Wash squash and cut off tops. In a
large casserole, bake squash 30-45 minutes or until slightly
softened. Meanwhile, cook bacon, drain and crumble. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Remove squash from oven and let cool enough to handle. Scoop out
seeds and meat inside of squash, leaving a 1/2-inch thick shell.
Place scooped meat into a bowl and combine with bacon, bread crumbs
and blue cheese. Season the squash shells with salt and pepper.
Stuff shells with cheese mixture. Return to oven and back 10 to 15
minutes more until squash is tender and stuffing is browned.

   GLAZED ACORN SQUASH RINGS
</P>
<P>
   (Makes 4 servings)
</P>
<P>
   1 large acorn squash (see note)
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup orange juice
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup light corn syrup
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup butter
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons grated lemon rind
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Orange slices
</P>
<P>
   Heat oven to 350 degrees. Cut squash into 3/4-inch slices.
Remove seeds. Place in a greased 13-by-9-2-inch baking dish. Bake
30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In a saucepan, combine juice, sugar, syrup, butter, lemon rind
and salt. Bring to a boil and simmer 5 minutes. Pour mixture over
squash. Bake uncovered for another 15 to 20 minutes, basting as
needed. Garnish with orange slices.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Butternut squash may be substituted if desired.

BEWARE OF BUGS AND VINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUTH S. FOSTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beware of birdseed!
</P>
<P>
   We all like to feed our little feathered friends, so we buy good
things for them to eat, like sunflower seeds, and niger and peanut
hearts and millet. Birds are smart and they soon figure out which
hand feeds them, so they cheer us with their chirping and
fluttering of wings to keep our rapt attention, and of course our
outstretched hand.
</P>
<P>
   But beware! Birdseed can carry the eggs of meal moths. In hot
weather these varmints hatch, eat starch, then pupate and turn into
small tan moths with black markings. You can tell if you have them
by the telltale sticky webs in seeds or crumbs or flour.
</P>
<P>
   Then they fly into your kitchen cabinets in search of places in
which to lay another generation of eggs. Once inside the cabinets,
you've had it, for they are almost impossible to get rid of. You
have to throw out all your food boxes, clean the cabinets, and
start over.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I know. Chopped sunflower hearts were my undoing. I use
sunflower hearts, because, according to my bird chart, everything
except hummingbirds eats them.
</P>
<P>
   During the heat wave of June we kept seeing all these moths, and
it took a while to identify the source _ two bags of sunflower
hearts. There were larvae (small, tan) pupating in picture frames,
in envelope flaps, where the wall meets the ceiling. And every few
days more moths would appear.
</P>
<P>
   They are slow and easy to swat, but it's the ones you don't see
that do the damage. I put bags of bread crumbs as bait near the
birdseed corner for them to lay their eggs in, changing them every
two weeks since their life cycle is about 30 days. I tried spraying
those I saw flying, but they never dropped dead; they just hid in
dark places.
</P>
<P>
   But they found the food cabinets and were even in the toaster.
So a long-needed cleaning is now in progress. The moral: If you
must feed the birds, store the birdseed in the garage in an
air-tight jar.
</P>
<P>
   While on the subject of bird feed, don't put it on the ground
because it can attract raccoons and other carriers of dreaded
rabies. Also, in bear country, set feeders away from the house. If
the bears find them, it's prudent to stop putting out feed. Bears
are large, dangerous animals, not cuddly teddies. Their population
has become quite large, and since they are protected, they do not
fear humans.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beware of vines as ground cover.
</P>
<P>
   Think carefully when choosing a ground cover. If you have bare
ground but don't want more lawn (and the high maintenance),
evergreen ground covers are very good.
</P>
<P>
   They spread slowly, while neat reddish bark mulch serves as the
lady-in-waiting. These plants are not cheap, and they don't provide
instant landscaping, but they're a good long-term investment, not
to mention an attractive design element.
</P>
<P>
   But problems arise when climbing vines, such as ivy and euonymus
are planted as ground covers, because when they finally become
established, they begin to climb. They climb on everything, trees,
houses, rocks, mulch piles, and in the woodlands.
</P>
<P>
   Then begins the time-consuming task of regularly pulling them
off everything.
</P>
<P>
   This problem came home to roost here as I tried to remove a
euonymus vine out of my fine, beautiful myrtle. When I first
designed the garden, I thought a nice creeping vine of variegated
euonymus up one tree would be interesting. A big mistake! For lo
these many years I have regularly been pulling it out.
</P>
<P>
   This time, I decided to eradicate it. I started and yanked. Long
fat-rooted tendrils had spread everywhere under the myrtle, far and
wide. The more I pulled, the more there seemed to be. I filled a
large garbage can with rooted sections. To buy just one of these
choice plants would cost $4 or $5. Yet I was throwing out a hundred
that had become invasive weeds.
</P>
<P>
   Now ivy and euonymus are both fine plants, if kept in bounds
with frequent pruning. However, without regular maintenance, these
vigorous non-natives tend to spread into the countryside, where
they smother our native plants. And as they climb trees, they
produce seeds, which birds spread even farther.
</P>
<P>
   One can avoid this by choosing ground covers that do not vine
and climb. One of the best is myrtle. With shiny, delicate
evergreen leaves and blue spring flowers, in the shade it remains
an elegant plant that can cover large areas. Evergreen pachysandra
is useful for shady areas as is the ever reliable (though
deciduous) hosta. Ajuga tolerates both sun and shade, while
creeping juniper needs a sunny location.
</P>
<P>
   As this information age comes of age, the gardeners of old who
did maintenance have become almost nonexistent or prohibitively
expensive, which means that more and more we have to do it
ourselves. So when making landscaping decisions these days,
consider future maintenance, and beware the vining ground covers.

SQUASH: FRESH FOR THE EATING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Practices for buying and storing squash vary
depending on which season of vegetables you are dealing with.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few tips from ``Vegetables'' by James Peterson
(William Morrow, 1998):
</P>
<P>
   _ Winter squash such as acorn, butternut, buttercup, hubbard and
delicata is actually picked in the fall and stored through the cold
months. Choose squash without any soft spots, which indicate that
the vegetable may have been improperly stored.
</P>
<P>
   Winter squash will keep for up to a week in a paper bag in the
refrigerator; for several weeks in a cool (50-degree), airy place;
and for up to three months if hung in a net bag that will allow air
to circulate. Do not store in plastic bags, as they tap moisture
and may encourage rot.
</P>
<P>
   You'll need four (1-pound) winter squash or the equivalent to
feed four people.
</P>
<P>
   _ Summer squash such as pattypan, zucchini and yellow crookneck,
are best when they are young and quite small (cigar-shaped squash
are best if cooked when eight inches long or less). Select squash
that aren't dented or gashed and don't have any soft spots.
</P>
<P>
   Store summer squash in a ventilated plastic bag in the
refrigerator for up to three days. Before cooking, scrub well with
a brush or rough sponge.
</P>
<P>
   As summer squash are mostly water, you'll need two pounds of
whole squash to feed four people. One pound of zucchini or summer
squash will yield 3 1/2 cups sliced squash.

GREAT GAME SHOW HAS SOME DISTURBING DEMOGRAPHICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' was a summer smash, an
intelligent, compelling game show imported from the United Kingdom
that produced monster ratings.
</P>
<P>
   It also was overwhelmingly white _ and male.
</P>
<P>
   The contestants selected for an opportunity to be on the show
were male by a 4-to-1 ratio. As for those who actually sat in the
``hot seat'' opposite Regis Philbin, the numbers were more
staggering: 15 men, two women.
</P>
<P>
   This is not good when the television industry has been
rightfully slapped around for its lack of diversity. The question
for this show is why the homogeny?
</P>
<P>
   Contestants had to get through on a 900 phone line and quickly
and correctly answer three questions posed by a computer to get
onto a panel, then be the fastest with a correct answer _ the
``fast finger'' playoff _ to get into the hot seat. The system was
designed to ensure an equal chance for everyone to get on during
the 13-show run, the network said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some people squawked about not getting through or on
_ there is a million bucks on the line. That was expected. But the
female question has the show's makers flummoxed. I'm at a loss,
too. I've heard some suggestions, like men are more likely to
instinctively blurt out answers, which is why they could have an
advantage in the phone and ``fast finger'' rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why our daughter is going to an all-girls high
school,'' my wife said. Of course, this was after I had shouted out
my guess, again, at the TV before she had a chance to respond. I've
heard of this phenomenon in other homes.
</P>
<P>
   So guys are quick on the trigger, right or wrong (must be all
that practice with the remote control). But what about
``Jeopardy!''? That show requires quick responses, and women have
done well there. So that isn't necessarily it.
</P>
<P>
   This is where I'm supposed to make some insightful, sly or silly
conclusion. The truth is I just don't have one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Yes, there should be a
question mark, and, no, there isn't) will return in November,
either for a short run like the one just passed, or as a
replacement series. I vote for the former; keep it an event.
</P>
<P>
   But before the leaves fall, somehow, some way, the producers
better figure out what is going on with the lack of females, or it
will be women screaming at the TV.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GOODBYE SUMMER, HELLO JERRY
</P>
<P>
   Summer is not over when school starts, or when the leaves turn,
or when football comes back. Summer is over when Jerry Lewis sweats
and cries in a tuxedo, giving everything he has for a cause.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for Lewis' annual Labor Day weekend Muscular Dystrophy
telethon, a fund-raiser that has netted $1.6 billion since its
debut in 1966. Despite his recent bout with viral meningitis that
felled him in July on tour in Australia, Lewis plans on being
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go through with it,'' Lewis, 73, told Larry King
on CNN last week. ``I cannot not do it. The responsibility is so
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis' telethon sidekick for 32 years, Ed McMahon, said both
he and Lewis are getting smarter as the years go by, recognizing
that a telethon is a marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, he started listening to me a few years ago,'' McMahon
said in a recent interview. ``So in the middle of the telethon we
take a short break. You are much stronger at the end of the
telethon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wear yourself out, no matter how strong you are,'' said
McMahon, the former ``Tonight Show'' sidekick who is still going
strong at 76. ``Most of the money comes in that last three or four
hours of the show; you have to be at your strongest.''
</P>
<P>
   McMahon said he met with Lewis two weeks ago as the entertainer
was preparing to meet with local telethon hosts from around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed weak as I met him in the hallway,'' McMahon said.
``But as the thing progressed, he seemed stronger and stronger and
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is the plan after Lewis, after McMahon? McMahon said he
did not know, since neither one plans on going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an old Marine. That helps,'' McMahon said. ``I will keep
going as long as I'm around. I'm not going to retire, and I don't
think Jerry is going to retire. It's not his nature.''

TAX CUT DEBATE HINGES ON ROLE OF GOVERNMENT DEFINITION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 5)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT E.THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ We are about to witness a classic
liberal-conservative, Democrat vs. Republican debate over the use
of taxpayers' money and the federal government's role in protecting
the aged, the very young and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Gone for the moment is the good gray atmosphere in which
conflicting ideologies often are accommodated and policies
compromised by the opposing sides.
</P>
<P>
   Observers may find it difficult to penetrate the cloud of
bombast and hyperbole that will permeate Capitol Hill when the
opposing forces again square off this week. But they will have no
difficulty discerning that the end goal the two sides are fighting
for is victory in the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was set for the coming showdown when, as Congress
prepared early last month to depart for its summer vacation, the
GOP majority in both houses passed a 10-year, $792 billion tax cut
and President Clinton vowed to veto it.
</P>
<P>
   It is rare that a president of one party and a Congress
dominated by the other party confront each other on an issue that
so clearly defines their philosophical differences.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, we often hear the assertions that there is little
difference between the two parties. Sometimes that criticism is
valid, especially when arch foes on Capitol Hill put pragmatic
politics ahead of partisan dogma to solve legislative disputes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it should be noted that, despite the desires and
demands of their leaders, the two parties are rarely monolithic. On
such matters as abortion, gun control, and campaign spending,
usually a few liberal Republicans will cross party lines to vote
with Democrats, and some conservative Democrats will vote with
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The current dispute grows out of a question that Congress and
the White House have not had to answer for the past three decades:
What do you do with a budget surplus? Since the flow of red ink has
been halted, government officials speculate that the surplus could
reach $3 trillion over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are betting, therefore, that when voters trek to the
polls next year, they will favor the party that sought to give them
a healthy tax break and less government.
</P>
<P>
   As Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who heads the House Ways
and Means Committee, explained: ``Americans are paying the highest
taxes as a percentage of the nation's economy since World War II.
We should give it back to them before it gets spent by the
bureaucrats.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats are wagering that voters, most of whom are
enjoying the most robust economy they've ever known, would prefer a
much smaller tax cut (something around $300 billion) and use of the
surplus to save Social Security and Medicare, give more aid to
education and the environment and pay down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Although both parties have cut and raised taxes over the years,
Ronald Reagan made tax reduction an article of faith for
Republicans in the 1980s, just as Franklin D. Roosevelt, during the
Great Depression of the 1930s, made big, benevolent government a
symbol for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's successor, George Bush, undercut his own credibility
and that of his presidency when he agreed to a tax increase after
saying, ``Read my lips. No new taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever remote chance Walter Mondale had of defeating Reagan in
1984 evaporated when, at the Democratic Convention in San
Francisco, he declared: ``Mr. Reagan will raise taxes and so will
I. He won't tell you. I just did.''
</P>
<P>
   That line drew a thunderous ovation from the assembled
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   After some soul searching and poll taking by the White House,
however, Reagan announced quite firmly that he would not boost
taxes. He went on to carry every state but Mondale's Minnesota and
the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan experience, in which an across-the-board tax cut in
1981 produced economic expansion and a decline in joblessness, is
one the Republicans cite as their model. But the Democrats point
out that the Reagan tax cut, coupled with sharply increased defense
spending, boosted the deficit and the national debt far beyond
previous records.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Reagan left the White House, the national debt was
over $2 trillion and the interest on that debt was $150 billion.
After national defense and entitlement programs, interest on the
debt was the third largest item in the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting taxes is popular and important. The American people have
a right to feel oppressed by massive, costly government. A cut in
taxes can influence entrepreneurs to invest money in business
expansion, which, in turn, creates more jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But it should be recalled that despite all the grumbling over
Bill Clinton's 1993 tax increase on the wealthy, which did not win
a single Republican vote in the Democratic-dominated Congress, the
economy has surged to new heights.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows when it might careen downward, wiping out the
surplus and bringing an end to the euphoria that now grips the
country. When that happens, a tax cut might be just the remedy to
get the economy moving.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, our leaders would do well to channel the lion's
share of the government's excess revenue into protecting vital
programs such as Social Security and Medicare and diminishing the
national debt before they approve an enormous tax cut.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Most hot new companies insist their product is going to change
the world, but two California start-ups promising to revolutionize
the way people watch television are beginning to attract a lot of
believers.
</P>
<P>
   Their revolution, as measured by sales of so-called digital
video recorders, hasn't really begun yet. But the companies' goal
of using computer hard drives to give people greater control over
their TV viewing _ including instant replays, putting live TV on
hold, and recording shows all year long with one click of the
remote _ has shaken up the broadcasting world and spawned
soul-searching about the future of TV.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, some of the biggest names in the
entertainment and Internet world have showered millions of dollars
on the two companies selling DVRs, TiVo Inc. of Sunnyvale and
Replay Networks of Mountain View. WebTV, owned by Microsoft, is
expected to enter the market later this year in an alliance with
satellite broadcaster Dish Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's caught everyone in the industry by surprise,'' said Peg
Murphy, vice president of business development for NBC Interactive,
which has invested millions of dollars in both TiVo and Replay
Networks. ``It's one of the few interactive TV applications to come
along in the last few years that makes sense because it actually
makes watching TV easier.''
</P>
<P>
   The bugs are still being worked out of the technology, but there
is a growing buzz about how DVRs will allow consumers to escape the
straitjacket of network schedules and possibly avoid TV
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to make a complete change in the way people
watch TV,'' said Josh Bernoff, TV analyst at Forrester Research in
Cambridge, Mass. ``What you're seeing here is the beginning of an
enormous change in the way TV works.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a videocassette recorder, a digital video recorder records
and plays back TV shows, but without tapes or any complicated
programming. All you need to know is the name of the show; there's
no need to know when it's on or the channel. A couple of clicks
with the remote and it's done. You can direct the machine to record
the show every time it comes on. It even sets its own clock.
</P>
<P>
   The digital video recorder captures the incoming TV signal,
compresses it, and records it on a computer hard drive. The machine
plugs into a telephone jack and downloads up-to-date channel
lineups for the coming two weeks in the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   DVR users can view a show from its beginning while it's
recording, unlike users of a videocassette recorder, who must wait
until a recording is done to start watching. Say you want to record
the ``Sopranos'' on HBO at 9 p.m. on Wednesday and watch it that
same night, but the children aren't put to bed until 9:30. Just
click on the ``Sopranos'' when the house is finally quiet and start
watching from the beginning while the DVR continues to record the
end.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you're not recording a show, the digital video recorder
is always recording some of whatever show is being watched. That
can come in handy. Say you're watching a live broadcast of a
baseball game and your mother calls. You can hit pause, take the
call, and later resume watching where you left off. Or you can hit
instant replay and watch Nomar Garciaparra make a play at shortstop
again. DVRs put the viewer in charge.
</P>
<P>
   The first reaction of most people is that a DVR is nothing more
than a souped-up, computerized VCR without the capability of
playing taped movies. Reviewers so far have liked the technology
but been turned off by the price.
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from $500 to $1,500, depending on the recording
capacity, which runs from eight to 30 hours using the poorest
recording quality. Recording capacity drops dramatically as the
quality of the recording _ or the amount of data recorded _ is
increased. TiVo and WebTV also have monthly subscription fees of
$9.95 and $24.95, respectively, although TiVo offers a lifetime
subscription for $199.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety percent of US homes have VCRs, but the machines haven't
really changed the way people watch TV. Only a third of VCR users
tape a TV show at least once a week, and just under a third never
tape anything, according to a survey released earlier this year by
the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts think DVRs will change that and end up
changing TV in the process. They think DVRs will become portals to
television, much the way America Online, one of many TiVo
investors, has become a major access point for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of watching live TV, consumers may increasingly select
shows they want to watch days or weeks in advance and use their
DVRs to watch them whenever they want. The TiVo machine monitors
your viewing habits and records shows it thinks you might like.
ReplayTV allows users to customize their own networks around a
theme or a favorite actor.
</P>
<P>
   Bernoff of Forrester Research predicts DVRs will be the
fastest-growing consumer electronics product in history, with four
out of five homes having one within 10 years. The impact on TV will
be enormous, he says. ``Primetime'' could become increasingly
irrelevant as more shows get recorded for later viewing, while
middle-of-the-night time slots could become hot properties in an
environment where time-delay TV is the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Bernoff's boldest prediction is that the millions of people who
will watch TV on a DVR will skip through the commercials, knocking
the economic pins out from under the broadcast networks. Certainly
DVRs make it easy: ReplayTV lets the user skip forward in 30-second
increments, while TiVo offers a high-speed fast forward. A decade
from now, Bernoff predicts, ad viewing will be cut in half, as
consumers decide it's more efficient to watch NBC's three-hour
Thursday night lineup in two hours and 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ent of Boston, who bought a TiVo DVR, says the ease of
recording has changed his viewing habits. He now records his
favorite shows and watches them whenever he wants, almost always
zapping through the ads. ``I'm sort of out of sync now with live
TV,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is convinced. Karen Agresti, senior vice
president and director of broadcasting at Hill, Holliday, Connors,
Cosmopulos, said the same gloom-and-doom network scenarios were
popular when VCRs came on the market. ``This is technically not a
new idea,'' she said. ``The majority of people still watch shows
when they air.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Ryan, the head of Pro Media Inc., a Natick, Mass.
media-buying firm, says it will be hard to change entrenched
viewing habits. ``That's really not how people view TV,'' she said
of the DVR time-shifting philosophy. ``And, besides, some people
like to watch the commercials.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy at NBC Interactive said the network continues to believe
programming will be ad-based, but she acknowledges it may not
revolve around 30- or 60-second spots five years from now. ``We
don't think this is going to be revolutionary overnight,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that media titans like NBC, CBS, Showtime, Walt Disney,
Time Warner, Liberty Media, Comcast Corp., and Cox Communications
are investing in TiVo and Replay Networks may have an impact on the
debate. Officials at TiVo and Replay Networks are downplaying their
machines' ad-zapping capabilities and stressing a willingness to
work with broadcasters and the advertising industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to give viewers more control, but we're very sensitive
to the business issues of our partners,'' said Stacy Jolna, vice
president of programming and media partnerships at TiVo. ``There is
a happy medium there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Jolna says, the onus will be on advertisers to make
sure people continue to watch their ads. General Motors, for
example, is working with TiVo on targeting ads at specific TiVo
owners. In other words, GM might run an Oldsmobile ad during ``60
Minutes,'' but as TiVo users replay the show at a later time GM
might substitute ads that would be more appropriate for each user.
Families might see a minivan ad, while singles might see an ad for
a sports car.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone acknowledges that DVR technology and programming
is in its infancy. Recording time is limited, channel switching is
sluggish, and DVRs make an annoying, crackling computer sound
constantly. But improvements are expected. In less than two years,
Bernoff predicts that a machine with 24 hours of recording time
will cost less than $500. The machines themselves could disappear
as the technology is incorporated into cable TV set-top boxes and
satellite broadcast receivers, and coupled with on-screen Internet
access.

WHAT DID THE `AUTOMOBILIST' SAY TO THE FIDGETY HORSE? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Writing about cars, and loving cars, is a lot like writing about
baseball, or loving baseball.
</P>
<P>
   I look with a delightful sense of hope toward the future _ and
with all the changes electronic on the horizon, those changes will
compound like interest owed a loan shark; yet I am also, as
Fitzerald said of Gatsby, drawn inexorably to the past.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is why a new book by Will Anderson, a Maine writer,
caught my eye. The last book of his I read was called ``Was
Baseball Really Invented in Maine?'' and it was a fascinating
record of minor-league ball and major-league players with ties to
that state. Now comes Anderson with another book about _ you
guessed it _ cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``You Auto See Maine'' is a wonderful romp through one state's
cultural car history.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson chronicles auto dealers and their offerings, come and
gone, or still with us; he gives us great dry jokes infused with
Maine logic and humor, and news accounts that reflect the ascent of
this newfangled machine, the automobile, on the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   It is a book set in Maine, but it is a book that could have been
written in any state.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, advice given by a newspaper columnist on what an
``automobilist'' should do when encountering a horse: ``Stop the
vehicle and, if the horse is frightened, turn off the engine. If
there is any difficulty, the driver of the automobile should lead
the horse himself or have him led past the automobile.'' Keep a
human between the car and the beast, he continued, and if the horse
remains fidgety, say, ``Whoa.''
</P>
<P>
   In a news account from the Portland Daily Advertiser of December
1903, a meeting of the Brewer City Council is reported. The purpose
of the meeting was to discuss ``good roads,'' but our correspondent
noted ``after they had got at the topic they found that there were
no good roads to discuss, and so they changed the subject to bad
roads.''
</P>
<P>
   We learn that on Middle Street in Lewiston in 1905 you could buy
a Jackson, five-passenger Model C with perfect balance and perfect
alignment, sold under the slogan ``No sand too deep, No hills too
steep.'' Anybody seen a Jackson lately?
</P>
<P>
   We learn that in 1924 _ I see a trend here _ the Forest City
Filling Station in Portland installed an automobile vacuum cleaner
. . . useful in getting all the dust out of closed car
upholstery.'' Could the car wash be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   And finally, for those who want to reach out and touch a bit of
the old car culture, Anderson offers up tangible relics of that
past: diners and drive-in theatres.
</P>
<P>
   ``For diners, there's the Palace in Biddeford (Maine's oldest
diner, opened in 1927), the Deluxe in Rumford (in operation since
1928), the Miss Portland . . . and the Brunswick. There's also the
storied Moody's in Waldoboro and the Maine Diner in Wells.
</P>
<P>
   ``For drive-in theatres, there's the Saco Drive-In (opened in
1939 and one of the oldest extant drive-ins in the world), the
Skowhegan, Prides Corner in Westbrook, the Bridgton, and, way
upstate, the Skylite, in Madawaska.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who besides baseball has written books about beer,
roadside delights, cafes, and old-time Maine, strikes a chord with
this book on autos, if only because its snappy recount of news and
humor, its use of old ads and photos, allows any who read it to be
drawn inexorably to the past. And surely, all auto enthusiasts
enjoy looking into the rear-view mirror on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You Auto See Maine'' is available from Anderson &AMP; Sons'
Publishing Co., 34 Park St., Bath, Maine 04530.

   John White, who has left this space, has not left the world of
automobiles, and he recently spent time chasing some of the steam
cars that made ascents up Mount Washington.
</P>
<P>
   White writes to us:
</P>
<P>
   It was the ultimate game of King 'O the Hill and the British
won, 3-2, scoring an automotive first in the process _ a
father-son-in-law team driving two steam cars in succession to the
top of Mount Washington in a single day.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Aug. 13, Basil Craske of Norfolk, England, piloted
his Like-A-Mobile (a replica of a 1903 Locomobile) to the
6,288-foot summit in an hour and 10 minutes. He was accompanied by
his father-in-law, John Liming, also of Norfolk. After a brief
celebration, both descended in a modern car, and Liming, assisted
by Craske, drove his 1911 Stanley up the mountain in less than half
the time of the '03, finishing with an astonishing burst of speed
up the final stretch of 22-percent grade to the top. Liming built
both cars, incorporating original parts.
</P>
<P>
   In the interval between those ascents, Gerry Stoneman, of
Tiverton Devon, England, reached the peak in a 1922 Stanley _ three
of the six British-owned steamers shipped from the United Kingdom
for this event made it to the summit. Only two of 79 American-owned
steamers got to the top in the weeklong celebration of the
centennial of the first car up Mount Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Four years in the planning, the commemoration and weeklong steam
tour were organized by the Stanley Museum, Kingfield, Maine, with
major support from the Mount Washington Auto Road Co., owner of the
road to the summit. The event attracted 85 steamers _ mostly
Stanleys _ and 300 museum members from four continents.
</P>
<P>
   The British drivers spent about $27,000 of their own money, plus
about $7,500 put up by the Auto Road Co. and Audi, official car of
the road, to transport their steamers across the Atlantic for the
celebration.

<P>
   Judging by commentaries in the Western media, many observers
seem to be equating the hostilities between Russian armed forces
and Muslim separatists in Dagestan with the 1974-'76 war between
Russia and Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But despite some superficial similarities, lumping together the
two fights is a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton went so far as to liken the Russian
president, Boris Yeltsin, to Abraham Lincoln, a defender of his
nation's integrity, when Yeltsin sent Russian troops into Chechnya
five years ago on a misguided adventure that only made all the
problems in Northern Caucasus far worse than before.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the relatively free Russian media are not even asking
obvious questions that might clarify what's behind the escalating
crisis in Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   For example, how is it that Russia's elite special services and
intelligence organizations failed to foresee or even to monitor the
onslaught of hundreds of armed Chechen fighters led by the warlord
Shamil Basayev into Dagestan? Some Russian troops actually were
withdrawn from Dagestan a few months prior to the rebels' attack.
Why?
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Russia's integrity is hanging in the balance.
During Yeltsin's debacle in Chechnya, the prestige of Russian
troops was badly damaged, but also very significantly, the fighting
fueled the rise of militant Islam there.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are important questions to be asked: Will people in
Dagestan be lured by the siren song of Islamic unity sounded from
Chechnya? Will the call for a free Islamic state win over more than
just a few villages?
</P>
<P>
   Former Prime Minister Sergei V. Stepashin said, just a few hours
before he was fired by Yeltsin: ``We may well lose Dagestan'' _ not
exactly the sort of news the Kremlin wished to hear.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened in Dagestan? And why so much ignorance now
about what's really at stake?
</P>
<P>
   Regrettably, the world's attention span is short, and this part
of the world has not been on everybody's mind. Since 1976, when its
war with Russia ended, victorious Chechnya has turned into a
humanitarian disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The population in Chechnya has dropped from about 1 million to
perhaps 300,000. Its economy has become virtually non-existent.
Theft of oil from the Russian pipeline, robberies, kidnapping,
ambushes and ransom seem to be the only viable industries.
Officially, unemployment in Dagestan amounts to 20 percent;
unofficial figures put it as high as 80 percent. Youth unemployment
stands at about 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Russia lost the war, but the Chechnyans cannot win the peace. No
wonder the example of Chechnya has not proved attractive to the
majority of Dagestanis. While the benefits of independence from
Russia remain dubious, the chaos, dislocation and rampant crime in
Chechnya are there for all to see.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Stepashin, the current prime minister, Vladimir
Putin, on Aug. 7, confidently stated that the separatists in
Dagestan would be crushed in two weeks. Moscow did claim victory
over the rebels a little more than two weeks later. As of Aug. 31,
however, the air strikes and artillery raids were raging, with
eight Russian soldiers killed and 31 wounded _ and, by Russia's
count, about 80 rebels dead.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that no government can afford to stand idly by as
bands of armed terrorists try to foist the banner of Islamic
fundamentalism on a population that, for the most part, wants no
part of it. A strong military response is needed, but in Dagestan
it is a disaster to think that will cure the problem.
</P>
<P>
   During the war in Chechnya, many Dagestanis volunteered to fight
the rebels alongside Russian troops. The battle now being fought in
Dagestan is not merely military, and its outcome is by no means
clear.
</P>
<P>
   If Dagestan is vulnerable to fundamentalism, it is not out of
religious ideology. The government needs help in building a better
life for its 2 million people. Its population is a patchwork of 34
ethnic groups. In some villages, the people speak two or three
languages. Stability in such places depends on deft political
footwork but also _ and perhaps most of all _ on economic
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   All of the republics of Russia's Northern Caucasus are in dire
straits. It is here that the Russian government has been failing in
the most miserable way. About 87 percent of Dagestan's budget comes
from Moscow, making the republic virtually dependent. Given the
state of Russia's economy, however, those transfers do not amount
to much.
</P>
<P>
   What is Russia to do? So far as these republics are concerned,
there can be no benign neglect. In fact, neglecting them could have
explosive consequences. Islamic extremism characteristically gains
strength in areas of massive poverty and powerlessness. Moscow
needs to act fast to develop and implement a workable economic
strategy. Yet the government in Moscow can barely take care of
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in this battle, Russia deserves at least moral support
and understanding. In Chechnya the issue was secession; in Dagestan
it is invasion. All of Russia's political parties and leaders,
including critics of the war in Chechnya, have spoken in support of
the efforts to eject the invaders, who include foreign mercenaries,
from Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, even if Russia can come up with a program to
ensure stability and economic control, it is by no means clear that
the people of Dagestan will respond gratefully and reject the call
for Islamic unity.

WEB SITE REACHES OUT TO TEACHERS, STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JO-ANN JOHNSTON  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The Internet venture NY Wired is trying to create
a market of school children, parents and teachers who will visit
the company's new, education-oriented Web site.
</P>
<P>
   NY Wired also hopes to create a magazine or cable television
channel. The new Web site will collect and disseminate lesson
plans, homework help and school-Web site tools to the public for
free.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the site gets a share of the profits from
commercial goods sold through http://www.nywired.net, said
co-founder Brian Lee. E-commerce sales of clothing, computers,
household supplies and even on-line courses for teachers will
subsidize the whole venture, which is soon to go national, Lee
said.
</P>
<P>
   An Internet retailer conducting business on the Web site, Value
America/E-Store, is selling computers and Internet access for $20
per month to help NY Wired reach a wide market. The initial
computer purchase can be made over the phone, and the retailer said
it can finance parents with poor or no credit histories.
</P>
<P>
   And, in an additional publicity boost, Gov. George Pataki helped
unveil the Web site at a news conference in downtown Albany on
Wednesday. Pataki said the Web site helps his administration's
efforts to raise ``educational standards across the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said he wasn't endorsing the choice of commercial
retailers hosted on the site, only focusing on the Web site's
educational potential. Pataki noted the Web site will make
available free to teachers 250 multimedia lesson plans _ developed
by other teachers _ that meet the standards of the state Education
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Executives involved in the venture would not reveal sales goals,
but Lee said the breadth of content offerings on the Web site
should set NY Wired and its national counterpart, US Wired, apart
from 20 or 30 competitors in the educational market.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site also will offer special software to protect
youngsters from accessing obscene material. NY Wired is licensing
that software feature from an Elmira company, Exotrope Inc.
Software developed and licensed by the Albany Times Union will
allow schools and districts to create their own secure Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, NY Wired may broaden the spectrum of content or
services, said Lee, whose own company employs seven people.
</P>
<P>
   Additional for-profit vendors may also get onto the site and
compete with ones already there, noted Tom Starnes, president of
the Virginia-based Value America.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, his company sells IBM, several IBM-compatible
brands and Apple computers. But Value America doesn't carry
computers from popular manufacturers Gateway or Dell Computer, he
said, so he expects those vendors may also be included on the Web
site to afford customers a broader choice.
</P>
<P>
   NY Wired is going to do similar launches of Web sites in
California, Texas and Florida, said Lee, under the name US Wired
for Education.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said he'll also look for support from governors of those
states, including Texas Gov. George W. Bush, currently running for
the Republican nomination for president, and his brother, Florida
Gov. Jeb Bush.

``ALL THE LITTLE ANIMALS'' NEVER QUITES CLICKS INTO PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a producer, England's Jeremy Thomas has had a distinguished
career and is responsible for such worthy films as Nicolas Roeg's
``Bad Timing,'' Stephen Frear's ``The Hit'' and Bernardo
Bertolucci's ``The Last Emperor'' _ for which Thomas took home the
1987 best picture Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   With this adaptation of Walker Hamilton's 1970 novel, ``All the
Little Animals,'' Thomas has finally taken a stab at directing,
and, not too surprisingly, it's a movie brimming with good
intentions, solid production values and searing performances.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, however, it never quite clicks into place with any real
satisfaction. The ingredients all seem to be there for a rich,
emotionally engrossing movie experience, but the storytelling flair
and directorial ``touch'' are not.
</P>
<P>
   It's about Bobby (Christian Bale), a young man from a wealthy
London family who has been somewhat mentally handicapped since a
childhood automobile accident, and has compensated by developing a
strong love for animals, especially his pet mouse.
</P>
<P>
   When his mother dies, his wicked stepfather (Daniel Benzali)
wants him to sign over his claim to the family department store.
When he refuses, the stepfather kills the pet mouse and threatens
to have Bobby committed to an asylum.
</P>
<P>
   He runs off to Cornwall, and soon meets Mr. Summers (John Hurt),
a eccentric hermit who loathes humanity and wanders the winding
roads of the province burying the road kill, because he believes
``all living things are of equal value.''
</P>
<P>
   The two are a match made in heaven, and the rest of the movie
has these soulmates confessing their tortured pasts, forming their
own little family unit (based on their mutual love of animals), and
struggling to set Bobby free from the lingering threat of his
stepfather.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good cast _ Bale is winning, and so is Hurt, who has more
than his usual moments of power and poetry. Though its morality is
dubious (killing bad people seems to be OK, killing irritating rats
and cockroaches is not), it's hard not to like the film's larger
ecological sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   But its basic situation never quite leaps to life with any
credibility, it soon becomes predictable, and when its last act
makes a big turn toward pure melodrama _ and a lengthy chase
sequence that might have been borrowed from a bad James Bond movie
_ it becomes a bit ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   All the Little Animals. Directed and produced by Jeremy Thomas.
Screenplay by Eski Thomas. Cast: John Hurt, Christian Bale, Daniel
Benzali. Lions Gate Films. 110 minutes. Rated R for violence.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+

`LOVERS ON THE BRIDGE' IS BOTH RHAPSODIC AND MADDENINGLY
FRUSTRATING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This 1991 film is the current cause of Miramax Zoe and
director/film restoration advocate Martin Scorsese.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, they have rediscovered the ``lost'' French
films ``Purple Noon'' and ``Belle du Jour'' and brought them to
American audiences. Now, it's the turn of ``The Lovers On the
Bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is directed by the quixotic Leos Carax, whose latest,
``Pola X,'' a tale of obsessive love starring Catherine Deneuve,
caused a stir at this year's Cannes Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lovers on the Bridge'' is both rhapsodic and as
maddeningly frustrating as any film can be that is hell-bent upon
wreaking havoc on traditional story structure and heightening the
poetry ascribed to the cinema as a visual medium.
</P>
<P>
   Carax goes against cinematic cliches by making his protagonists
an unattractive, unlikely pair. One is Michele Stalens (Juliette
Binoche), a self-destructive painter who is going blind. The other
is Alex, a violent, fire-blowing street performer thug with an
innocent's heart.
</P>
<P>
   The homeless pair meet and fall in love on the Pont-Neuf bridge,
the oldest landmark in Paris, while it is undergoing restoration.
It's a metaphor for their love, that oldest emotion in the world
that must continually be restored if it is to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Carax, always an anarchic director, repaints the sugar-coated
film romances of other popular French directors such as Jacques
Demy with a grittier primer (though in the end, all these
characters are not very far apart _ they just approach love from
different angles). He cares more about the physical world in which
his characters live than in whether they're likeable.
</P>
<P>
   That's a blessing and a curse for this overly long, difficult
film. The challenge is not intellectual _ it's sitting through
two-plus hours with people without enough history or credibility to
believe in.
</P>
<P>
   Their violent romance is forced and the ending betrays
everything that's come before. It feels false and Binoche, who
apparently begged for the role because she did not want to be seen
``as a pristine angel'' in the movies, is totally out of her league
as a rich woman who chooses the streets over the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Lovers On the Bridge'' is breathtaking when it
relinquishes control of its fractured story to cinematographer
Jean-Yves Escoffier's incredible palette of lights, color and
fantasy. His perfect eye makes this film difficult to dismiss. His
shots of Binoche water-skiing against a Niagara Falls-like set on
the Seine, of fireworks blasting against the lovers standing in awe
upon the bridge, of missing person's posters with Michele's face
filling the subway and being set afire by Alex are extraordinary,
breathtaking and desperately alive. They almost compensate for the
negatives of the film.
</P>
<P>
   But Carex ultimately proves we still need information and story
in order to identify with people who are a discomfort to us. While
we can admire him for his courage, we can't connect to his wayward
vision of such desperate, delinquent love.
</P>
<P>
   The Lovers On the Bridge (Les Amants du Pont Neuf). Directed and
written by Leos Carax. Cast: Juliette Binoche, Denis Lavant,
Klaus-Michael Gruber. Miramax Zoe. 125 minutes. Unrated. In French
with English subtitles.

   HOLYWOOD-EDGE (Undated) _ When Albert Brooks, playing a
successful middle-aged screenwriter in ``The Muse,'' is bluntly
informed by a baby-faced executive reptile at Paramount Pictures
that his writing has lost its ``edge,'' it is the career equivalent
of a death sentence. Only magic of a particularly glitzy and silly
Hollywood sort can help him regain it. Edge. Oh to have it! To be
on the cutting edge, to be, as they say, edgy! If you're pitching a
movie or a television show to a Hollywood baby mogul nowadays, it
had better have edge, or you're history, kiddo. But what is that
exactly? After running neck and neck with the sweet old-fogyish
``hip'' to evoke what's progressive, contemporary and (excuse the
cliche) ahead of the curve, edge seems to have pulled ahead. It
has, as they say, the edge. By Stephen Holden.

be that super after all. And Steve Jobs' use of that term to
describe his company's newest desktop computer is making some waves
in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs, the interim chief executive officer of Apple Computer
Inc., made a big splash Tuesday when he unveiled the machine in San
Francisco before a packed auditorium of Mac enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   From the stage, Jobs announced that the machine was ``by
definition'' a supercomputer. Apple's Web site also proclaims that
the machine sports a ``supercomputer on a chip.''
</P>
<P>
   A coming advertising campaign hammers home the theme, portraying
the new pearly white and gray machine as some kind of secret
weapon, guarded by a circle of military tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The ad plays off what Jobs said was an apparent warning the
company received from the federal government, which cautioned that
the G4 was so powerful it could not be imported to ``sensitive
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Some computer industry analysts say that Jobs' assertion that
the G4 is a supercomputer is based on a dated government definition
enacted to control technology exports to hostile countries.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jobs, the G4 is a supercomputer because it runs at
the ``gigaflop'' level. A computer running at a speed of 1 gigaflop
can perform roughly 1 billion calculations per second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flop'' is short for ``floating-point operations per second.''
A gigaflop of power is roughly equal in computing to four 400 Mhz
Intel processors.
</P>
<P>
   But that definition of a supercomputer has been long outdated,
said Karen Green, a spokeswoman with the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications, a National Science Foundation computer
research agency based at the University of Illinois campus in
Champaign-Urbana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Jobs is a very, very clever man,'' Green said. ``But
he's using an old standard that people in the field know just isn't
correct anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Schiller, the vice president of worldwide product marketing
for Apple, said the ``supercomputer'' label was valid. He said
Apple's claim was based on the government export restriction
definition as well as the use of the gigaflop standard to describe
the performance of supercomputers built by other companies, such as
Silicon Graphics Inc. and its subsidiary, the Cray supercomputing
unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the majority of supercomputers today, the gigaflop is the
measure of performance,'' Schiller said. With the G4, Schiller
said, ``people can get into the entry level of super computering.
That is true.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Crandall, who holds the title of ``distinguished
scientist'' at Apple, argues that the ``super'' label can be
rightfully attached to the G4 because it is the fastest computer
available commercially.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Green and other computer specialists,
supercomputers have, for the last several years, been running at
the ``terra-flop'' level _ 1 trillion calculations per second. The
U.S. Department of Energy uses terraflop machines to calculate
long-range global warming forecasts and to make predictions about
oil and gas depletion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gigaflops isn't that fast any more,'' said National Science
Foundation spokesman Peter West. ``It's a standard from way, way
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Jobs' definition of supercomputer seems to be derived from
export restriction rules set by the Department of Commerce in 1996.
Those rules maintained that 1-gigaflop machines would be subject to
export controls, the better to prevent hostile countries from using
them.
</P>
<P>
   The 1-gigaflop export restrictions, however, have long been left
in the dust by technological advances. Now, someone with a modicum
of computer engineering education and a soldering iron can cobble
together a 1-gigaflop machine from cheap computer parts.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, following lobbying efforts from Silicon Valley,
has asked Congress to approve Commerce Department guidelines that
increase the supercomputer power definition to a little more than 3
gigaflops. That change is expected to be approved by Jan. 23, 2000,
months after Apple's ``supercomputer'' ad campaign takes hold.
</P>
<P>
   No matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a marketing play anyway,'' said Lou Mazzucchelli,
an Apple analyst who is quick to add that the G4 was still the
``biggest, baddest machine'' in the world of desktop computing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably more accurate to say the G4 is a vintage
supercomputer,'' Mazzucchelli said.

   HOLYWOOD-EDGE (Undated) _ When Albert Brooks, playing a
successful middle-aged screenwriter in ``The Muse,'' is bluntly
informed by a baby-faced executive reptile at Paramount Pictures
that his writing has lost its ``edge,'' it is the career equivalent
of a death sentence. Only magic of a particularly glitzy and silly
Hollywood sort can help him regain it. Edge. Oh to have it! To be
on the cutting edge, to be, as they say, edgy! If you're pitching a
movie or a television show to a Hollywood baby mogul nowadays, it
had better have edge, or you're history, kiddo. But what is that
exactly? After running neck and neck with the sweet old-fogyish
``hip'' to evoke what's progressive, contemporary and (excuse the
cliche) ahead of the curve, edge seems to have pulled ahead. It

SAN FRANCISCO _  RIBS  _ Ribs are a passion. Everyone has a
favorite marinade or barbecue sauce recipe for making them, and
many argue about where to buy the best take-out. They've also been
showing up in Bay Area restaurants in several forms _ and they're
being served way beyond the usual American red sauce barbecue
variety. &HT;    Main story is followed by rib basics sidebar, three perfect
barbecue sauces and recipes.

three hours they're rich, juicy and absolutely delicious.

 RIB-O-RAMA: Any Way You Rack 'Em, Juicy Ribs Are Worth the Effort   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Ribs are a passion. Everyone has a favorite
marinade or barbecue sauce recipe for making them, and many argue
about where to buy the best take-out. But sloppy and succulent as
they are, ribs aren't exactly what one might expect to find on
sit-down restaurant menus. Or are they?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ribs have been showing up in many Bay Area restaurants in
several forms _ and they're being served way beyond the usual
American red sauce barbecue variety.
</P>
<P>
   Some have Asian influences; others take on Caribbean notes. And
some have a fusion of ingredients from a variety of cuisines to
create spicy, sweet, bone-gnawing satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Many restaurants cook their ribs using a combination of
techniques and cooking methods. At Ginger Island in Berkeley's
ever-expanding Fourth Street shopping area, the ribs are cooked
three times. First, they're rubbed with a spice mixture and
steamed. Next, they're covered with orange juice and baked.
Finally, they're put on the grill to caramelize and take on a
haunting smokiness.
</P>
<P>
   At Montage, the stylish restaurant that opened in San
Francisco's Sony Metreon this summer, the ribs are first brined in
a combination of beer, orange juice and spices. Then they're smoked
for flavor and tenderness and slathered in a complex hoisin-spiked
barbecue sauce.
</P>
<P>
   And at The Rooster in San Francisco, which serves an eclectic
mix of food, the ribs are marinated, baked and then grilled.
</P>
<P>
   These different cooking techniques _ rubs, brines, marinades and
numerous cooking methods _ are indeed more work than simply
grilling a slab on the backyard barbecue but you still can use your
grill to make restaurant-style ribs at home.
</P>
<P>
   We gathered four terrific rib recipes from Bay Area restaurants
that are perfect for the home cook. The recipes are long but can be
done in stages. Brines and marinades can be started a couple of
days in advance, as can many of the sauces. In fact, this gives
them time for the flavors to marry. Some of the ribs can be
completed a day ahead and then rewarmed or finished on the grill.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want something simpler, we've included a primer on
the different types of ribs available and cooking techniques, and
three versatile barbecue sauces that can be used to baste ribs
while they cook.
</P>
<P>
   With all this, you're set to create spectacular racks of ribs
for a Labor Day gathering, or for any time you're craving the zesty
all-American favorite.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Ribs can't live by sauce alone. The kind of ribs and how they're
cooked make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   It's all a matter of personal preference, of course. Many swear
by baby back ribs, but others love big beef ribs. Some insist that
``real'' barbecue must be smoked; still others believe in grilling
or oven-roasting.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; RIB TYPES
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  There are three types of pork ribs suitable for barbecue:
spareribs, country-style pork ribs and baby back ribs. Beef ribs
are a nonpork option.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Spareribs.  &LR; These traditional ribs are cut from the underbelly
of the pig. Many markets sell them with a fatty brisket running
across the top quarter of the ribs. Remove it or have the butcher
do it for you.
</P>
<P>
   If the spareribs come with a flap of meat partway across the
side, they're called Kansas City-style ribs. If the flap of meat _
called the brisket _ is removed, the ribs are referred to as St.
Louis-style.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Country-style spareribs.  &LR; These are meaty pieces from the rib
end of the pork loin. They are sold in individual pieces and each
piece has a small bone. Boneless country-style spareribs are cut
from the pork butt.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Baby back ribs.  &LR; These are cut from the loin and have more meat
and less fat than other pork ribs, and are quite popular.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Beef ribs.  &LR; Even though they're larger than pork ribs, these
usually have less meat. The slabs are cut from the loin and have
five or six bones per slab.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR; RIB PREPARATION
</P>
<P>
   However you cook ribs, marinating or brining adds flavor.
Because the meat is chewy, they can be marinated for a long time
without the meat getting mushy. Dry rubs also impart delicious
flavors to ribs.
</P>
<P>
   If you've prepared a marinade, baste the ribs frequently with it
or with a barbecue sauce during cooking. However, if your marinade
or sauce is high in sugar, use it sparingly during the early
cooking or the sugar will burn.
</P>
<P>
   Also, be sure to stop basting during the last 15 minutes so any
bacteria from the raw meat that's made its way into the marinade on
the ribs can burn off.
</P>
<P>
   If you plan to serve the sauce on the side at the table,
separate a portion of it so it never comes in contact with the raw
meat. If you forget, boil the sauce or marinade for two minutes to
kill any bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; COOKING RIBS
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Grilling.  &LR; It's the summertime favorite way of cooking ribs.
Keep the heat at medium because ribs take a long time to cook (75
to 90 minutes depending on the ribs). If the flame is too hot, the
outside will burn before the meat is tender.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Smoking.  &LR; This takes longer than grilling but imparts a
magnificent flavor to meat. Wood chips are what give the meat
flavor, so consider using one type of wood like mesquite, maple or
oak, or a blend. Chips should be soaked in water for about an hour
then scattered over the hot coals.
</P>
<P>
   You can turn a grill into a modified smoker. Build a small
charcoal fire. When the briquets are hot and ash-covered, move them
to the side and put a pan of water in the bottom of the grill.
Place a grate over the charcoal and pan; place the ribs on the
grate. Cover the grill and smoke the ribs until the meat begins to
pull away from the bones, adding more hot briquets if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Baking.  &LR; In winter or on rainy days, you can resort to
oven-roasting. Roast the ribs at 325 to 350 degrees on a rack over
a foil-lined baking sheet. Place a pan of water in the oven to keep
the ribs moist.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
THREE PERFECT SAUCES:
</P>
<P>
   The secret's in the sauce. You can grill, steam, bake or smoke
but in the end, it's the sauce people taste.
</P>
<P>
   Barbecue sauce is relatively easy to make. Most sauces don't
need to be cooked, and many don't even require a lot of
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   As easy as they are to make, they're just as easy to vary.
Sauces can take influences from Asia, the Mediterranean or the
Caribbean, or they can be made in the great melting pot style
called all-American.
</P>
<P>
   When making barbecue sauce, keep a few things in mind. The
balance of sweet, salty, spicy and vinegary components is what
makes the sauce great. These elements can come from a variety of
ingredients, but they all need to be there to one degree or
another.
</P>
<P>
   The sauce's sweetness is particularly important because it also
aids in caramelization, which gives the surface of the meat all
those good gooey brown touches. But because many sauces are very
sweet, they burn rapidly and should be brushed on only in the last
15 to 20 minutes of cooking. Tomato-based recipes _ particularly
those that have ketchup as a primary ingredient _ usually are high
in sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Also, barbecue sauces frequently are strongly flavored to pair
up with the big flavors of the meat and the grill. These might seem
pungent, but they mellow a bit when cooked.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR; SPICY TOMATO BARBECUE SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   This recipe is ideal for ribs because it's hearty and robust
with just a hint of sweetness. Marinate the ribs in the sauce for
up to 8 hours, or just brush it on while they're cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 (141/2-ounce) can chopped peeled tomatoes with juices
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup distilled white vinegar
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons dark molasses

   In this recipe, the peanut butter predominates, but hoisin sauce
adds sweetness, the chile paste and chile peppers lend heat, and
soy sauce is the salty component.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup creamy peanut butter
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons rice vinegar
</P>

 &LR; TAMARIND GUAVA BARBECUE SPARERIBS
</P>
<P>
   This recipe, from The Rooster in San Francisco, is an
interesting mix of sweet, smokey and spicy ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   3 pounds of baby back ribs
</P>
<P>
   1 pint of Guinness Stout
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 shallots, sliced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup dry red wine
</P>
<P>
   2 cups beef or chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   1 cup guava jelly
</P>
<P>
   6 fresh tamarind pods or 4 ounces tamarind pulp
</P>
<P>
   5 large fresh or canned tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   1 canned or dried chipotle chile
</P>
<P>
   1 whole cinnamon stick
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Cut the ribs into 4 equal portions. Place in a container large
enough to hold the ribs in a single layer. Pour the Guinness over
them and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours or up
to overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the ribs from the Guinness (reserve Guinness). Season the
ribs with salt and pepper. Place in a large baking dish. Pour the
Guinness over the ribs, cover the dish tightly with foil.
</P>
<P>
   Bake until the meat is almost falling off the bones, turning
once, about 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the ribs to a platter and let cool.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare a fire in a barbecue (medium-high heat).
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the
shallots and saute until golden brown. Add the red wine, bring to a
boil and cook until reduced to 1 tablespoon, about 10 minutes. Add
the stock, jelly, tamarind, tomatoes, chile and cinnamon stick.
Bring to a boil, stirring until the jelly melts. Reduce the heat
and simmer 1 hour, until the flavors blend and the sauce coats the
back of a spoon. Stir in the vinegar and season with salt and
pepper. Strain the sauce through a wire mesh sieve, pressing with
the back of a wooden spoon to extract all the flavorful liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Cut between the ribs to separate them. Brush liberally with the
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Grill until slightly charred, brushing occasionally with sauce.

 &LR; HOISIN-GLAZED RIBS
</P>
<P>
   These ribs, from Montage in San Francisco, get their sweetness
from a hoisin coating and a wonderful depth of flavor from being
brined for at least 24 hours, then cooked in a smoker. This recipe
makes a lot of sauce _ more than you'll need for the ribs. The
extra sauce may be refrigerated in a covered container for up to 3
days, or frozen for up to 3 months.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   The Ribs
</P>
<P>
   1 quart beer (preferably pale ale)
</P>
<P>
   2 cups orange juice
</P>
<P>
   8 garlic cloves, smashed

<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; To make the ribs:  &LR; Combine the beer, orange juice, garlic,
onion, orange zest, salt and pepper in a container large enough to
hold the ribs. Add the ribs. Cover and refrigerate at least 24
hours or up to 2 days. Drain, reserving the brine.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare a smoker or use a grill as a smoker by building a small
charcoal fire. When the briquets are ash-covered, push them to the
side. Place a pan filled with the brine on the bottom of the grill;
surround by the coals. Place a handful of soaked chips on top of
the briquets. Place an oiled grate over the coals and pan. Place
the ribs meaty-side up on the rack. Cover. Keep the heat at medium,
adding more briquets if necessary, and additional hickory chips
when there's no visible smoke. Smoke until the meat begins to
shrink away from the bones, about 2 to 21/2 hours.

STUDY SAYS ON-LINE BROKERS NEED TO BOOST CUSTOMER SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ On-line trading is creating a monetary boon for
Internet brokerage companies, which are rewarding their new
customers with shabby treatment. That's the conclusion of a new
study released by Jupiter Communications, a New York-based Internet
market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, on-line brokerage assets will top $3
trillion by 2003, up from $415 billion spent on Internet trading in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   However, the study found, that success has not translated into
customer care. Fewer than 40 percent of financial service Web sites
responded to customer inquiries within one day, ``which is
inadequate for such a service-intensive business,'' Jupiter said in
a statement released with the study.
</P>
<P>
   The survey is based on a test of 125 leading Web sites that
service a number of electronic commerce categories, including the
Web retail market, which scored a 64 percent response rate to
customer inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   That customer response score is actually an improvement over a
survey done earlier this year, when Jupiter found that only 24
percent of financial service Web sites could give a one-day
response to customer e-mail queries. However, the study stated,
``it is still too low for companies that control consumer on-line
finances.''
</P>
<P>
   That poor performance could, in the long run, put a cap on the
on-line financial market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing that new on-line financial services customers
are mainstream, risk-averse consumers who have far less tolerance
for technology issues and customer service issues,'' said Rob
Sterling, a Jupiter analyst. ``Key players are going to have to
think more like retailers and invest in the infrastructure to help
support a more mainstream customer base.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Alban, a spokesman for Menlo Park-based ETrade, a leading
on-line trading site, said the company had already heeded the call
for customer service by tripling the number of customer service
agents and providing educational Web pages for neophyte traders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customer service is an important aspect of this industry, and
we intend to fulfill that need,'' Alban said.

 TASTER'S CHOICE: Back-to-School Bologna Flunks   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  With most schools back in session, bologna seemed
a logical candidate for Taster's Choice. It's a popular choice for
kids' lunches, and many adults like a good fried bologna sandwich
now and then.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Panelists seemed to like the idea; most of them had good
childhood memories of bologna. But when they tasted the 10 meat
bolognas, they were seriously disappointed and found the category
underwhelming. One panelist said he was going to find out if his
wife was feeding it to their children, and if she was he's asking
her to stop.
</P>
<P>
   The main complaint was the texture. Most of the meats were slimy
and many had an almost grainy quality.
</P>
<P>
   All the bologna was made with beef or a combination of pork and
poultry, and included low-fat and fat-free varieties as well.
(Bologna made exclusively from poultry products was tasted
separately; the results will run soon).
</P>
<P>
   Tasters liked  &UR; Safeway &LR;   &UR; Regular &LR;  (16 ounces, $1.99) best. One
panelist liked its peppery flavor; another liked the smoky taste.
But a third panelist described the flavor as metallic, and still
another thought it had the flavor and texture of liver. One would
buy it, two might buy it, and two would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Russer Beef Bologna &LR;  ($4.89 per pound at Safeway) came in
second. One panelist thought the meat tasted less processed than
other brands; another described the flavor as balanced. But others
found the meat too mealy. Two might buy it; three would not.
</P>
<P>
   Third place was a tie between two of the light bolognas:
 &UR; Oscar Mayer Light &LR;  (eight ounces, $2.19 at Andronico's) and
 &UR; Russer Beef Bologna Light &LR;  ($5.29 per pound at Safeway).
</P>
<P>
   With the Oscar Mayer brand, three panelists objected to the
texture (``mushy and slimy''), but one panelist thought it had a
``nice bite.'' Two enjoyed the flavor, one even calling it
``classic.'' One would buy it; four would not.
</P>
<P>
   Three panelists thought the Russer was rubbery, but two others
liked its firmness. One liked the meaty flavor. Two would buy it,
three would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Oscar Mayer Beef Bologna &LR;  (16 ounces, $2.19 at Andronico's)
came in fifth. Four tasters thought it was too salty; two thought
it was mushy. But another thought the texture was okay and liked
the slightly smoked flavor. Two might buy it; three would not.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also tasted Oscar Mayer Fat Free, Oscar Mayer Light
Beef, Oscar Mayer Regular Bologna, Bar S and Safeway Beef Bologna
but they scored too low to rate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Panelists were Dan Bowe, associate culinary director, Center for
Culinary Development; John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Roland
Passot chef-owner, La Folie in San Francisco and Left Bank in
Larkspur and Menlo Park; Kim Severson, Chronicle staff writer; an
Kirk Webber, chef-owner, Cafe Kati, San Francisco. All products are
tasted blind. &QL;

 WINE POTPOURRI: Dessert Lovers Warm Up to Ice Wines   By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Dessert wines are such a small part of the wine
market that most people don't know they exist. Now thanks to the
efforts of some patient and enterprising Canadian and New York
wineries, interest in these wines is looking up.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dessert wines are sweet and can be enjoyed either with dessert
or as a dessert by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For many collectors, French Sauternes and Barsac are the
ultimate in sweet wines. Others prefer German Auslese or Hungarian
Tokaj.
</P>
<P>
   The German style, using Riesling or a handful of other white
grapes, produces wines of sublime balance and complexity. Canadian
winemakers, mainly in Ontario and British Columbia, have adopted
this style, but instead of Riesling are using grapes like
Ehrenfelser and Vidal. Many of the resulting wines are made in the
German Eiswein style.
</P>
<P>
   Eiswein (ice wine) is made from the concentrated juice of frozen
grapes. It's a risky business because the slightest glitch in the
weather can ruin an entire grape crop. There is also the issue of
botrytis, a beneficent mold that attacks the grapes at harvest when
weather conditions are right and causes the berries to shrivel.
This transforms the grape juice into an ultra-sweet nectar.
Sauternes and German eiswein are always affected by botrytis.
</P>
<P>
   Because of international laws protecting place names, most sweet
dessert-style wines made outside France and Germany are called Late
Harvest or Select Late Harvest Botrytized. Late Harvest wines may
or may not be botrytized.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet wines took center stage at one event held during the
Kapalua Wine &AMP; Food Symposium in July in Maui. Six sweet wines were
paired with desserts, including a coconut mousse cake, a mango
Bavarian and a chocolate tart.
</P>
<P>
   Among the wines tasted were Joseph Phelps 1997 Special Select
Late Harvest Riesling, Grgich Hills 1995 Violetta Late Harvest and
Lafaurie-Peyraguey 1995 Sauternes. But the two that caused the most
excitement were Inniskillin 1996 Icewine VQA from Ontario, Canada
and Hunt Country 1997 Vidal Ice Wine from New York. Both were made
from Vidal grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Vidal is a hybrid grape grown mostly in the eastern United
States and Canada, and used for dry as well as sweet wines.
</P>
<P>
   The Inniskillin Icewine was viscous and sweet with luscious
tropical fruit flavors, excellent acidity and enough botrytis to
add complexity and depth.
</P>
<P>
   The Hunt Country Ice Wine, from New York's Finger Lakes, offered
many of the same attributes, but leaned more to ripe apricots with
a lovely sweet/tart balance. Both were good choices with the mango
Bavarian.
</P>
<P>
   Next time you're racking your brain for a different dessert, try
serving a chilled ice wine from Canada or New York with fresh
fruit.
</P>
<P>
   The best places to find these wines are in fine wine shops, or
ask your wine merchant to order them for you.
</P>
<P>
   The Ice Wine Quarrel
</P>
<P>
   With the growing popularity of Canadian sweet wines, Vintners
Quality Alliance, the Canadian wine authority, last year filed to
make terms like Icewine, Vin de Glace, Eiswein and Special Select
Late Harvest official trademarks to protect the image of Canadian
Icewine. The problem is, other trade organizations _ like
California's Wine Institute and the French Institute National des
Appellations d'Origine _ object because the regulation would limit
export of their wines to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Wine Q &AMP; A
</P>
<P>
   Q: Henry B. Meyer of San Francisco is the owner of the following
three old European wines and he wonders about their drinkability
and value.
</P>
<P>
   A: Zeller Schwarze Katz (Black Cat) is made from a number of
individual vineyards, around the town of Zell on the Mosel River.
It is a white wine made for early consumption, so it is unlikely
that the 1957 Schwarze Katz is still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Gilis 1933 St. Emilion Light Bordeaux is a mystery to me,
although at 66 years old, I would think that any ``light'' wine
must now be an undrinkable curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   Caraco &AMP; Benitez Malaga Oro, may be the keeper of the lot.
Malaga is a sweet dessert wine from the Costa del Sol region of
Spain. Some Malagas age well, but since there is no way of knowing
the true age of your wine, I'd pull the cork. If you decide to
drink the Malaga, I'd like to hear your impressions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: C. Earlenbaugh of Oakland inherited a bottle of Charles Krug
1972 Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon and is curious about its value
and if any restaurant has an interest in adding his Cabernet to its
wine list.
</P>
<P>
   A: Not knowing the history of the particular bottle, I can only
offer general advice. Vintage 1972 was not that good in the Napa
Valley for red wines, and most of the best wines were already
tiring by the early 1990s. Since any remaining '72s are not
generally on collector's lists, I suggest gathering together a few
friends to enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, restaurants can not legally purchase wine from a
private party.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Janne Mahan of Menlo Park wants to know where to purchase
1995 Signorello Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
</P>
<P>
   A: Signorello reports the wine is mostly sold out, but
Andronico's may still carry some. Or, call Linda at Signorello,
(707) 255-5990, for more help.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A few weeks ago, a reader asked about the availability of
Barbera Blanc, a blush-type wine made from the Barbera grape.
</P>
<P>
   A: Readers have informed Potpourri that a Barbera Blanc called
Imbianco is available for $9.50 at Viansa Winery, 25200 Arnold
Drive in Sonoma and at Viansa's Lo Spuntino tasting room on the
square in Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   Hemp Wine
</P>
<P>
   I recently read an item in The Wine Trader that renews my faith
in the ingenuity of the American entrepreneur. Nirvana Homebrews in
the Finger Lakes region of New York State is selling Hemp 'n' Wine,
red and white grape wines blended with hemp oil. Jim Castetter of
Nirvana Homebrews says it is not liquid marijuana. ``There is no
THC in our hemp wine _ none,'' he emphasises.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on hemp wine, log on to  &LR; www.hempwine.com &LR; 
or call (888) 520-9463.

 CRUSH '99: Harvest Starts With Sparklers   By Janet Fletcher  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 NAPA, Calif. _  Trucks loaded with yellow picking bins began
lumbering up the Silverado Trail last week as the annual grape
harvest got under way in Napa Valley. First out of the starting
gate are the sparkling wine producers, who pick early to get grapes
that are still high in acid.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The crop looks on the light side,'' says Zach Berkowitz, vice
president of operations for Domaine Chandon. ``And I know people
say this every year, but this year the fruit's really delicious.
With the cool season we had, it's got good acidity and lots of
flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   To a large degree, the short crop can be blamed on rainy weather
in the spring of 1998. That's when the vines, in a two-year cycle,
began determining how many bunches they can produce in the fall of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Beckstoffer, one of Napa Valley's largest growers, says his
crop is down, too. But last year's weather may not be the only
explanation. The extensive replanting in the valley due to
Phylloxera may mean lower crops routinely, he says, as growers
replace University of California at Davis clones known for high
yield and disease resistance with French clones selected for
quality.
</P>
<P>
   Beckstoffer says he has warned his client winemakers not to try
to slip away for a week's vacation. After a slow growing season,
the crop is coming on faster than many expect. ``We think people
are a little more relaxed than they should be,'' the grower says.
``If it keeps going with 95- and 100-degree days, it's going to be
one of those harvests where everything is ready at the same time.''

 AT THE SOURCE: Figs' Plucky Nature Comes at a Price   By Janet Fletcher  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 BRENTWOOD, Calif. _  If you've ever wondered why fresh figs are so
expensive, listen to Rick Knoll describe how they're picked.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Kadotas and Adriatics will eat your cuticles,'' says the
grower, proprietor of Knoll Organic Farms in Brentwood. The milky
latex that oozes from a fig stem when pinched ``is like Compound W.
A drop of milk from a green fig will dissolve a wart.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoll says his harvesters either wear surgical gloves or tape
their fingers like football players. His own fingers are so damaged
he can't pick any longer.
</P>
<P>
   To protect his crew, Knoll has designed a small harvesting knife
so workers no longer have to pinch the fruit off the stems. The
knife slows down the harvesting but saves the hands of laborers who
may have to pick figs almost every day for three months.
</P>
<P>
   Knoll's five acres of figs include Kadotas, Adriatics, Missions
and Brown Turkeys, all capable of producing two harvests a year in
Brentwood's warm climate. The early crop, harvested in June, tends
to be lighter and of shorter duration than the late summer crop.
``It's just enough figs to make you crazy,'' says Kristie Knoll,
Rick's wife. ``We never have enough for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   By September, the Knolls are picking and packing the second crop
for restaurant customers such as Oliveto, Flea Street Cafe, Chez
Panisse and Black Cat, and for retailers like Real Food, Mollie
Stone's and Rainbow Grocery. The Knolls' luscious, oozy figs are so
popular at San Francisco's Ferry Plaza Farmers' Market _ even at
$3.50 a pound _ that shoppers get angry when the couple skips a
week. The elderly woman who helps them at their booth says she has
been accosted on BART by customers wanting to know where the figs
were.
</P>
<P>
   The Knoll fruit wins fans because it is picked when ripe instead
of when still firm enough to ship. At their ripest, Knoll figs may
be 25 percent sugar and have a shelf life of only three or four
days. Plump and prone to squashing, these fragile figs demand
coddling from field to table.
</P>
<P>
   At the farmers' market, Kristie Knoll tears her figs in half and
prods novices to take a taste. ``People don't want to touch
something that's kind of soft,'' she says, but she eventually gets
them to cradle a Brown Turkey in their palm and to squeeze gently
to judge ripeness.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people look for a fig that's too beautiful,'' she
says. ``They see slits in the skin and think, `Pass on that.' But
that's what you should be looking for. That means it's ready to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brown Turkey fig has a thin, light brown skin and flesh that
ranges from soft pink to raspberry. The Adriatic and Kadota are
both green-skinned figs, but the Kadota flesh is typically
honey-colored while the Adriatic's is pink-to-strawberry. The
Kadota produces a drop of honeydew on the bottom when ripe; the
Adriatic gets thinner-skinned, almost translucent.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Mission figs have purplish-black skin and red
flesh, and the uglier they are, the better. ``They get a little
semi-dried looking, kinda shriveled and wrinkly,'' says Kristie.
``You rip those in half and eat them and, oh man, they're great.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep dead-ripe figs longer than a day, refrigerate them. If
the figs are still a little firm, store at room temperature and
they will continue to ripen. (Mission figs won't ripen off the tree
but the other types will, Rick says.)
</P>
<P>
   For the grower, the biggest challenge in getting figs to market
is saving them from the starlings and gophers. The European
starling is ``out of control here,'' Rick says, and it has few
predators. At least the native birds work on only one fig at a
time; the starlings peck a hole in all of them. Gophers, for their
part, can eat a young tree in an afternoon and kill a big tree if
given enough time. Some gophers eventually succumb to dogs, owls,
snakes or traps, but not before decimating a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally Kristie Knoll polls local restaurants to learn how
they're using her figs. Her recent discoveries _ roasted Adriatic
figs with duck (Chez Panisse Cafe, Berkeley); roasted fig-walnut
bruschetta with Cambozola cheese (Flea Street Cafe, Menlo Park);
red dandelion and arugula salad with figs (Oliveto, Oakland); and
grilled Brown Turkey figs with aged goat cheese wrapped in fig
leaves and grilled (Black Cat, San Francisco). Her husband likes to
smear a ripe Adriatic fig on a toasted English muffin. ``You can't
tell it from strawberry jam,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   If warm weather prevails, the Knolls' fig season can last into
October and beyond. ``One year we delivered figs to Real Food for
Thanksgiving,'' Kristie recalls. ``We always hope for that. But by
the middle of October, unless we have an amazing Indian summer,
we'll be on the down side of the bell curve.''

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Insalata's Ribs Owe Allegiance to Spain   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  With ingredients such as chocolate, orange and
sherry you might think that Heidi Krahling was making a dessert
rather than a main course. But when the meaty short ribs come out
of the oven after three hours they're rich, juicy and absolutely
delicious.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Krahling, who owns Insalata's restaurant in San Anselmo, has a
homey rustic style that draws inspiration from Spain, France, the
Mediterranean and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The ribs have lineage to the Catalan region in Spain. The meat
is first browned in oil, removed from the pan and replaced with
onions, carrots, celery and garlic. After the vegetables are well
caramelized, red wine is added and reduced over high heat. Finally,
the ribs are returned to the pan and they're baked in a 300-degree
oven for three hours.
</P>
<P>
   By that point the wine sauce is already bursting with flavor.
But even more character is added with chocolate, sherry, fresh
herbs and the zest of two oranges. These additions create a
wonderful, aromatic sauce that coats the meat.
</P>
<P>
   Although the recipe calls for homemade beef stock, there's so
much going on that if you cheat and use the canned variety, I'm not
sure even Krahling would know the difference.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant, which also has a carry-out counter where you can
pick up some of the popular dishes to take home, has become one of
the best places for a great meal in Marin County. The expansive
space, dominated by the open kitchen, has an upscale, but relaxed
ambience.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Insalata's, 120 Sir Francis Drake Blvd. (near Barber), San &LR; 
 &LR; Anselmo; (415) 457-7700. Lunch Monday-Saturday; dinner nightly. &LR;

the ribs as good enough, but at Insalata, the sauce is further
enriched with bitter chocolate, orange zest and sherry.

   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 300 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Season the ribs with a generous amount of salt and pepper. Warm
the olive oil in a heavy-bottomed casserole. Add the ribs and saute
until browned on all sides, turning as needed. Remove the ribs from
the pan and set aside. Add the onions, carrot, celery and garlic to
the pan and saute until caramelized, about 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the red wine and cook over high heat until it has reduced by
half. Add the tomato paste, tomatoes and thyme. Stir with a wooden
spoon to combine. Add the reserved ribs and the stock to the pan.
Bring to a boil, cover, place in the oven and bake for 3 hours, or
until the meat easily pulls away from the bone.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the meat from the pan; then strain the cooking liquid.
Return the liquid to the pan, add the sherry and cook over
medium-high heat until reduced by a third. Once reduced, add the
chocolate, thyme, marjoram, orange zest and butter. Season with
salt and pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Return the ribs to the pan and simmer for 2 minutes, just to let
the flavors blend.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with your favorite potatoes.

`BEDROOMS AND HALLWAYS': THE DISSOLVING BOUNDARY BETWEEN GAY AND
STRAIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't have to believe that the upscale London bohemians who
frolic through Rose Troche's comedy ``Bedrooms and Hallways''
actually exist to marvel at their easygoing sexual fluidity.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which aspires toward the playful sophistication of a
Noel Coward romp (but without the sharp class distinctions and with
a lot more sex), imagines a brave new world in which the
distinctions between gay and straight have begun to dissolve. In
this semi-utopian urban environment, whose characters live in
improbably spacious, well-decorated apartments, those who are so
inclined can experiment sexually without feeling the need to
declare a final, fixed orientation.
</P>
<P>
   What triggers this giddy comedy of erotic manners is the arrival
of Leo (Kevin McKidd), a love-starved 30-year-old gay artisan in an
ostensibly heterosexual men's consciousness-raising group. At a
ritual during which something called ``the honesty stone'' is
passed around and the members are encouraged to bare their most
intimate secrets, Leo confesses his attraction to his fellow group
member Brendan (James Purefoy). Although Brendan is momentarily
nonplused, his curiosity quickly triumphs over his initial
embarrassment. Suddenly Leo, who has been pining for a lover, finds
himself sleeping with the man of his dreams.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie's cleverest sequences, before their relationship
has been consummated, Brendan invades those dreams, sometimes in
period costume from Jane Austen. (It depends on what book Leo has
been reading that night.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Bedrooms and Hallways'' would end right here were it not for
Brendan's long-term relationship with Sally (Jennifer Ehle), who
works with him in a restaurant-bakery. When she visits the house
Leo shares with Darren (Tom Hollander), a flouncy gay
flibbertigibbet, Leo is shocked to discover that the woman with
whom Brendan is breaking up is his very own high school sweetheart.
Leo can't bring himself to tell Sally that he is sleeping with the
man who is leaving her, although the truth eventually comes out. At
the same time, he and Sally discover that they still have
``chemistry'' and begin taking a high school flirtation that was
never consummated to the next step.
</P>
<P>
   Having set several plots in motion, the movie does a fairly good
job of keeping them in the air. One subplot involves Darren's
relationship with a dominant real estate agent who has sex with him
in his clients' empty houses but who, to Darren's frustration,
refuses to be seen in public with him. Lesser subplots involve the
relationships and lives of the other men's group members.
</P>
<P>
   The movie takes easy potshots at a ``wild men's gathering'' in
some very tame woods where the participants avidly beat on drums
but prove so inept at foraging for their dinner that their leader
has to put in an emergency phone call for Chinese takeout. The most
superficially macho group member (who also discovers his gay inner
child) becomes hysterical when caught in some brambles.
</P>
<P>
   But having begun to explore the ins and outs of bisexuality,
``Bedrooms and Hallways'' loses its nerve and turns into a shallow
sitcom in which everyone is abruptly and mechanically paired off.
The potentially incendiary conflicts that the movie had begun to
explore are inexplicably dropped. The letdown is so steep it is
almost as though the film ran out of time and money before it could
be completed, and a frantic last-minute wrap-up was improvised to
save the day.

NO-FRILLS DVD VERSION OF `TITANIC' RELEASED 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By ROB LOWMAN 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Yes, Jack and Rose's story goes on and on. Earlier
this week Paramount finally released the DVD version of the
Oscar-winning, all-time box-office winner ``Titanic'' (suggested
price $29.99).
</P>
<P>
   The good news is the digitally remastered, effects-laden film
looks spectacular on the DVD. But for those of you looking for the
extras that are usually found on DVDs, forget it, which means real
``Titanic'' fanatics will have to wait for a future deluxe package
that might include those behind-the-scenes featurettes on the
``making of,'' cast bios and even historic features.
</P>
<P>
   Since DVD player prices are likely to dip below $200 (there are
already a few priced below $250) by the year's end and sales are
expected to boom, releasing the movie now is probably a profitable
move on Paramount's part. But since the studio hasn't committed to
a special-edition DVD ``Titanic,'' fans probably won't wait.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Paramount has also released episodes of the original
``Star Trek'' television series with William Shatner (Capt. James
T. Kirk), Leonard Nimoy (the half-Vulcan Mr. Spock) and the late
DeForest Kelly (Dr. Leonard ``Bones'' McCoy). The special effects
hardly look special by today's standards, but the crew of the
Starship Enterprise never looked better. Each DVD contains two
episodes at a suggested retail price of $19.95 each. So far,
Paramount has released two volumes, with ``Where No Man Has Gone
Before'' and ``The Corbomite Maneuver'' on the first and ``Mudd's
Women'' and ``The Enemy Within'' on the second. It plans to issue
four more volumes this fall and the remaining 34 in the next
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, for those looking for historical significance, ``The
Enemy Within'' marks the first time Spock uses the Vulcan neck
pinch to incapacitate a foe and McCoy utters the classic line,
``He's dead, Jim.'' &QL;

`ALL THE LITTLE ANIMALS': LEAVING OUT CHEESE FOR MICE AND
COCKROACHES? 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't be deceived by the sweetly benign title of Jeremy Thomas'
film ``All the Little Animals.'' This contemporary moral fable,
dressed up as a heart-in-your-throat psychological thriller,
accumulates the lingering force of an especially vivid and
terrifying bad dream.
</P>
<P>
   The film, adapted from a novel by Walker Hamilton, suggests a
modern-day Charles Dickens tale in which a young man cowering in
the shadow of an implacably cruel and treacherous stepfather flees
home to be rescued by an eccentric, life-loving woodland hermit.
</P>
<P>
   Modernized with an aggressive animal-rights agenda, the movie
poses troubling, unanswerable questions about the relative value of
human life in relation to other species and the extremes to which
people should go to protect life.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, it flirts with a storybook sentimentality.
(Somebody has to protect those sweet innocent cockroaches.) And in
its crowning and disturbing irony, the heroes who bend over
backward to avoid harming a mouse or a cockroach, act homicidally.
</P>
<P>
   The unalloyed malevolence of Bernard De Winter (Daniel Benzali)
and the gentleness of his 24-year-old stepson, Bobby (Christian
Bale), who has suffered brain damage from a childhood head injury,
lend these characters the mythic intensity of fairy-tale figures.
But the primal emotions the story stirs up and the all-out violence
unleashed insure that ``All the Little Animals'' is not a family
film.
</P>
<P>
   Benzali's hulking, scowling, baldheaded stepfather is too scary
for children. This is a man who in the movie's grimmest scene
orders his stepson to dig his own grave. Think of the Wicked Witch
of the West as a smooth-talking sadistic thug, and you get an idea
of the intensity of the menace he exudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the Little Animals'' is narrated by Bobby several months
after the events the movie describes. On the day of his mother's
funeral in a London suburb, the young man is summoned to the office
of his imperious stepfather, whom he refers to as ``The Fat,'' and
ordered to sign papers giving De Winter control of the fancy
department store his wife owned. Weeping and stuttering, Bobby
refuses, saying that his mother, whose wasting away he blames on De
Winter's bullying, told him not to.
</P>
<P>
   De Winter then gives Bobby an ultimatum: If he doesn't sign by 4
p.m. the next day, he will have Bobby committed to a mental
hospital for the rest of his life. Returning home, Bobby discovers
his beloved pet mouse, Peter, is missing.
</P>
<P>
   When De Winter appears in the doorway holding a plastic bag
containing the dead pet, Bobby, devastated, runs away from home
with only the clothes on his back. Hitching a ride to Cornwall with
a trucker, he precipitates a calamitous accident when the driver
gleefully tries to run down a fox in the middle of the road and
Bobby grabs the wheel to prevent him.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby is miraculously discovered and taken in by a kindly,
wizened man known only as Mr. Summers (John Hurt), who appears at
the scene of the accident and takes Bobby back to his cabin in the
woods and cares for him as though he were a wounded animal.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Summer's life is devoted to what he calls ``the work,''
which consists of burying the bodies of dead animals that have been
hit by cars. His magic cottage is a miniature utopian ecosystem in
which he leaves out cheese for the mice and the cockroaches.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Bobby is assisting Mr. Summers in his work, which
also consists of guerrilla actions like the pair's raid on a
lepidopterist's illuminated tent.
</P>
<P>
   But their idyll is threatened when Bobby runs into his
stepfather's lawyer and his family vacationing on the beach.
Eventually. Bobby and De Winter have a confrontation in which the
stepfather is revealed to be not just a greedy, bullying tyrant but
the murderous incarnation of pure evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the Little Animals'' would seem hokey if it didn't have
powerful, extraordinary central performances and cinematography
that lends the English landscape around Cornwall a mythical cast.
</P>
<P>
   Bale's Bobby is sympathetic but deeply, scarily troubled, given
to desperate tantrums and episodes in which he curls into a ball
and becomes a quivering vegetable. Hurt gives Mr. Summers the right
mixture of fanaticism, misanthropy and adult dignity.
</P>
<P>
   As for Benzali, with his gleaming pate, twisted little sneer,
predatory eyes and wattled chin, dressed in a $2,000 suit and
grimacing behind the wheel of a Rolls-Royce: he is a child's worst
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the Little Animals'' is rated R (Under 17 requires
accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has a gory knifing
scene.
</P>

 THE DAY HMOs MEET THE DEVIL  
 Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ About managed health care, I have a dream. An
ugly dream.
</P>
<P>
   Of the day all hell breaks loose.
</P>
<P>
   It starts right after lunch on a seemingly normal afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The point of spontaneous combustion is between my health
maintenance organization and all my ``health care providers.''
(What ever was wrong with ``doctor'' and ``nurse''?)
</P>
<P>
   In the office of my primary care physician, his tireless medical
secretary is the first to explode and ignite. A woman with 100
times the patience of Job, she has been patronized every day for
years by countless formula-following HMO functionaries.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, she is patronized one time too many.
</P>
<P>
   Still holding the phone, the secretary begins to shriek like a
wounded orangutan. In a flash, she rips the multiline unit out of
the wall and hurls it through the little open window of her office
and into the crowded waiting area.
</P>
<P>
   At that very moment, my doctor goes over the edge in his office.
The sort of intelligent and caring healer you thought went out with
house calls, he has just read his 861st ``denial of appeal'' letter
from an HMO. It is the last.
</P>
<P>
   His initial request for authorization for this patient's
procedure was turned down by a formula-following HMO functionary
without a medical degree; the appeal was denied by a physician who
has not practiced medicine since lasers were invented.
</P>
<P>
   Silently, but viciously, my doctor uses his bare hands to shred
all the insurance files in his office. His eyes blank and glassy,
he tears the lid off his laptop computer and tosses it out the
window to a loading zone below.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he lurches into his waiting room to break the chairs
and sofa into toothpicks, his medical secretary, associate and
half-a-dozen patients have taken to the halls _ along with the
staffs and patients from every other office in the building.
</P>
<P>
   All over town, in the offices of my dermatologist, my OB-GYN, my
orthopedist, the physical therapists who rehabbed my knee, the same
scene occurs. Everyone reaches the breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as quickly as a wildfire eats up dry pine, the phenomenon
spreads. Throughout California. Across the West. Over the Rockies.
Into the Plains. Down into Texas. Up to the Dakotas.
</P>
<P>
   In seconds, the fire of rage that began in my doctor's office
meets up with a now-out-of-control rage that had begun in a
pediatrician's office in suburban Baltimore. Before the chief
executive of any health maintenance organization can do a thing
about it, before the stock market can react, before sufficient
numbers of cops can be deployed to quell the uprising, the entire
country is engulfed.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the overwhelming anger and frustration that is suffered
in isolated pockets, thousands of times each day by every ``health
care provider'' and every ``health care consumer'' has reached
critical mass.
</P>
<P>
   Every person who ever futilely begged an HMO for an MRI, five
extra psychiatric sessions or a night in the hospital after their
baby was born goes ballistic. So do all senior citizens who
received a form letter in the mail announcing that they would be
dropped from their HMO in 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Just like the movie ``Network,'' people across the country start
screaming, ``I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it
anymore!'' The folks on phone hold, listening to Kenny G or ``Eine
Kleine Nacht Musik,'' go especially nuts. As if commanded by some
unseen general, they jump in their cars, flag down cabs, grab buses
or just start walking to the nearest office of their HMO.
</P>
<P>
   The medical secretaries and the people who must ask
semi-conscious, bleeding emergency room patients for their
insurance cards beat everybody else there.
</P>
<P>
   Each HMO building in every state is surrounded. Though no one
strikes a single match, the buildings burst into flame from the
force of all the collective anger. No one inside is hurt because
they, too, can no longer stand to participate in such a hated,
hideous industry; they join the people outside.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the selfish pirates who insist that compassionate
medical care can coexist with maximized profits comprehend what is
happening, it's all over. Every HMO office has been burned to
ground and nearly every American is without insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Congress meets the next day and finally has to do something
besides talk about health care.
</P>

   Another Horror To Contemplate
</P>
<P>
   Bubbling all summer with ``The Blair Witch Project,'' the horror
genre gained another prized ingredient this week with the video
reissue of Tod Browning's ``Dracula'' (1931), with a new score, by
Philip Glass. For more phantasmagoric developments, however, there
is the continuing adventure of a little film via the New Jersey
Pine Barrens called ``The Last Broadcast.''
</P>
<P>
   For several weeks last month, Stefan Avalos and Lance Weiler's
movie, a digital production made for $900, was a selection of the
Amazon.com Advantage for Video program, which provides filmmakers
with no other distribution channel an opportunity to offer their
wares. ``Virtual shelf space,'' said Weiler, who added that 1,000
copies of his film had been sold from Aug. 4 to Aug. 24, when the
tape was taken off line.
</P>
<P>
   That's a large number for such a short period. In fact, he said
``The Last Broadcast,'' about strange killings deep in the New
Jersey woods, was outselling many new main-line titles. Amazon
doesn't release sales figures, but Paul Capelli, a company
spokesman, said ``The Last Broadcast'' moved briskly. Weiler said
the tape was withdrawn when arrangements were made to distribute
the film in video stores later this month.
</P>
<P>
   By now, of course, killings deep in the woods have a certain
familiarity. A diverting concoction despite its obvious
contrivance, ``The Last Broadcast'' bears an uncanny resemblance to
``The Blair Witch Project.'' Both films are fictional documentaries
about fatal encounters with an unknown deadly force. Both use
hand-held video cameras, sometimes wielded on the run, to track or
flee from alarming developments in the bush. Weiler, whose film has
a more involved plot than ``Blair Witch,'' calls the similarities a
twilight area. ``It's a crazy parallel universe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the connection helped ``The Last Broadcast'' on
Amazon.com, it did little to close the gap with ``The Blair Witch
Project,'' which has made nearly $125 million at the box office and
is to be released on video on Oct. 22. If it's any consolation to
Avalos and Weiler, their film does have an interesting production
history. Shot with digital cameras and processed with desktop PC's,
the film has never been on celluloid. In a most unusual release, it
was beamed to a satellite and beamed back again to the rooftops of
theaters in five cities, downloaded through cable onto a hard drive
and run through a digital projector onto the screen. Weiler and
others in his company, Wavelength Releasing, near Doylestown, Pa.,
have demonstrated the process at many festivals and call it the
future of film distribution.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, there is video tape (a DVD is also planned).
Weiler said that Wavelength Releasing has prepared 17,000 cassettes
of ``The Last Broadcast'' for its store debut. ``In the end `Blair
Witch' was one of the best things that happened to our film,'' he
said.

   The Other Sister
</P>
<P>
   Superlative performances save Garry Marshall's lumbering,
overlong movie about a 24-year-old mentally retarded woman and her
determination to make her own way in the world. Discharged from a
special school, the headstrong Carla (Juliette Lewis, left, with
Giovanni Ribisi) wants a real job and her own apartment. That's
simply not possible, says her overpowering mother (Diane Keaton),
who would have Carla settle down for the rest of her life in the
family's protective cocoon. Soon, though, Carla has enrolled in
technical school, found a place of her own and landed a boyfriend (
Ribisi), an earnest and likable young man who is retarded, too.
Mother is not pleased, nor is she comfortable with the fact that
her other daughter is a lesbian. But, Stephen Holden wrote in The
New York Times, ``for all its disease-of-the-week television movie
inclinations, `The Other Sister' has a core of integrity.''

   The Mod Squad
</P>
<P>
   Based on the television series of the late '60s and early '70s,
Scott Silver's film reaches for the countercultural currents of
those years. In this case, why bother? To recapitulate, three young
lawbreakers (Claire Danes, Giovanni Ribisi and Omar Epps) are saved
from jail by a kindly police captain (Dennis Farina) and sent to
work undercover in clubs and bars. But soon the captain is dead,
some cocaine is missing from an evidence locker, and the mod squad
is handling its own investigation into murder and police
corruption. But rebellious youth given a second chance doesn't
resonate these days, and that's not the only problem in a film
``devoid of original plotting or suspense, clumsy in exposition,
played by unbelievable principals and ill-defined subsidiary
characters'' (Lawrence Van Gelder). _1999. MGM. $104.16. 94
minutes. Closed captioned. R.

`YES WE HAVE NO': AN ENGLAND NEITHER MERRY NOR OLDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The England in Nik Cohn's new book isn't the stuffy old England
of tea cozies, cardigan sweaters and sensible shoes. Nor is it Tony
Blair's Cool Britannia of new-wave fashion designers, cutting-edge
movie makers and hip young bands.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn's England is a darker, more desperate place _ a place
peopled by ``the jobless, the homeless,'' the disenchanted:
``miners and dockers and steelworkers who would never work again,
and school-leavers who would never work at all''; disaffected
immigrants, angry soccer fans, rhapsodic techno freaks, ``bikers,
fetishists, faith healers, visionaries, squatters, druggies,
lunatics and street heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohn is perhaps best known for writing the magazine article that
became the basis for the John Travolta movie ``Saturday Night
Fever'' (he later acknowledged that the article's central character
was a composite figure), and in ``Yes We Have No'' he uses the same
modus operandi he employed in his 1992 book, ``The Heart of the
World.''
</P>
<P>
   That book created a jazzy, street-smart portrait of the New York
demimonde by giving the reader a series of profiles of Broadway's
more colorful denizens, and ``Yes We Have No'' similarly pivots
around portraits of people Cohn met during his travels.
</P>
<P>
   This approach results in a certain overlap with English
travelogues written by Paul Theroux (``The Kingdom by the Sea'')
and Jonathan Raban (``Coasting'') during the 1980s. Once again we
are treated to depressing descriptions of blighted mill towns and
cutesified tourist meccas _ glimpses of a country merchandising its
past, even as it struggles with unemployment, poverty and a lost
sense of self.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn, however, focuses more insistently than his predecessors on
the eccentric, the bizarre and the outrageous, and as a result, his
portrait of England feels livelier, more menacing and less
representative than theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, his ``other England'' is a realm of millennial madness,
a world of Elvis impersonators, Hell's Angels and phony New Age
shamans that often seems to have more in common with American
tabloid culture than anything one usually associates with Britain.
</P>
<P>
   It's a world animated by rage and disappointment and defiant
hope, a world defined by the stories Cohn sees in the local papers:
``A man in Carshalton breeds tarantulas in his greenhouse, a man in
Milton Keynes is arrested for sexually molesting a Child of Prague,
a man in Leighton Buzzard claims he can communicate with ET's by
banging out a secret code on his satellite dish, and a Peterborough
grandmother, out walking her Lhasa Apso of a night, sees the Virgin
Mary, nestled among the pork chops and lamb kidneys, in the window
of her family butcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohn's companion on his travels through this surreal England is
a feisty young woman named Mary Carson who plays Virgil to his
Dante, guiding him through the lowlife maze of London's East End,
and accompanying him on a meandering tour through the cities of
northern England. Ms. Carson is not only an eager adventurer, but
as Cohn notes ``has never learned how to patronize,'' and her
infectious enthusiasm makes her a human magnet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment she stops racing, decides to give her boots a
break, people start to gather around her,'' Cohn writes. ``Drunks,
derelicts, Romeos and wide-boys on the make, storytellers,
argufiers and every manner of craicsmith come flocking to feed off
her batteries. Her energy and hunger act on them like instant
speed.''
</P>
<P>
   From King's Cross in London _ a neighborhood where cleanup crews
spend every morning removing ``last night's crop of ads from the
phone boxes'' (``Exotic Asian temptress,'' ``Paula, blonde
transvestite,'' ``Young English Rose'') _ Cohn and Ms. Carson head
off for the ``loafer's paradise'' of Bristol and Cornwall's Fraggle
Rock, a ``New Age travelers' site'' that provides a refuge for
those who have lost their jobs, their homes, their former lives.
</P>
<P>
   Next, it's on to Blackpool, ``a genial, tacky place, peopled by
gypsy fortunetellers and comic landladies,'' and Liverpool, a once
mighty port now reduced to selling its vanished past to the tourist
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Manchester, too, has metamorphosed since Cohn's last visit:
``The mills are gone; so is the grime. The black row houses have
all been sandblasted and are now a tasteful shade of cream.'' As
for the city's moral climate, it seems to have changed as well:
``When I drop into a corner pub,'' Cohn reports, ``the girl pulling
pints is wearing a halter top, cut-offs and no bra. She tells me
that it's a dead-zone here. `No work, no money, no nothing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other people Cohn and Ms. Carson encounter during
their travels are Laurence, a London School of Economics dropout
who has been strung out on crack and smack; a woman named Mary who
has spent the last four months looking for her missing boyfriend
and living on the streets; an Elvis impersonator named Paul Chan
who owns three clubs named Graceland; a right-wing anti-Anti-Nazi
who believes in ``Britain for Britons''; a model named Jess who
supports herself doing S&AMP;M shows, and an artist by the name of
Fista who is serving a five-year term for graffiti banditry.
</P>
<P>
   Because Cohn tosses off these portraits so rapidly, because he
puts so much body language on his prose, because he dwells so
insistently on the most melodramatic aspects of his subjects'
stories, the reader has little opportunity to get a real sense of
who these people are.
</P>
<P>
   They appear less as individuals, interviewed for their own sake,
than as brightly colored pieces of a larger mosaic _ a mosaic meant
to illustrate the author's own idiosyncratic vision of England as a
manic-depressive country: ``a land full of trouble, violent and
dispossessed,'' but also full of ``passion, energy, humor, rage.''

DIRECTOR'S KID BROTHER SHINES IN `WEST BEIRUT' 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
OUR RATING: 2 STARS 
By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; Lebanon isn't known for its thriving filmmaking community, so
when first-time filmmaker Ziad Doueiri returned to his home country
to make ``West Beirut,'' he had to scramble to find child actors
for his movie. Ultimately, Doueiri cast his charismatic younger
brother, Rami, in the lead role, and it is Rami's presence that
makes this uneven movie an occasionally diverting pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Rami plays Tarek, a quick-witted adolescent boy who roams the
streets of war-torn Beirut in search of adventure. It's 1975, and
the city has been divided along religious lines with the Christians
controlling East Beirut and the newly formed Muslim militia running
the western part. Tarek lives in the west with his friends Omar
(Mohamad Chamas) and May (Rola Al Amin).
</P>
<P>
   At first, the teens embrace the war. Schools close, parents are
preoccupied, and the bombings provide more thrills than chills.
Tarek and Omar indulge their passion for making Super 8 movies, and
the beautiful May provides some heavenly distractions, even if she
is a Christian. (She must hide her crucifix necklace from Omar, who
calls her the Virgin Mary.)
</P>
<P>
   Doueiri, best-known for his camera work on Quentin Tarantino's
films, wrote and directed ``West Beirut,'' basing much of the movie
on his own childhood memories. The film works best in its first
hour, achieving a rollicking lyricism as the kids find the beauty
in the emerging chaos.
</P>
<P>
   But as the war drags on, the movie loses its way. Doueiri
successfully imbues the movie's first half with a sense of
foreboding doom, but he doesn't build on that simmering intensity.
Scenes with Tarek's worried parents grow repetitive and a supposed
epiphany that occurs at a bordello falls flat.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the film's young actors _ all
non-professionals _ flounder when the movie shifts abruptly from
comedy to tragedy. Blame their inexperience and Doueiri's script,
which needed a third-act tune-up.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame, because ``West Beirut'' has many fine moments. A
beautifully filmed sequence in which Tarek and Omar stroll the
streets of Beirut to the strains of George McCrae's ``Rock Your
Baby'' shows that Doueiri has been paying attention while working
with Tarantino. Now he just needs to find a more cohesive story to
tell. &UR;  &QL;

IT WAS HER PERFECT CRIME UNTIL THE MURDERER CONFESSED 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review. Time,

(th) 
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before its opening credits, ``Happy Face Murders'' displays this
written prologue: ``Most of what you are about to see is true. The
stuff that isn't true is the stuff that's most believable. Go
figure.''
</P>
<P>
   These words, shown among big, yellow smiley faces while an
upbeat singer croons ``Put On a Happy Face,'' promise a story of
quirky wit. And while the film, Showtime's Sunday night feature,
does display some imaginative flair, it can't quite keep its
promise.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, most of what happens in the film is not true but was
invented by the screenwriter, John Pielmeier, whose stage credits
include ``Agnes of God'' and the current Broadway drama ``Voices in
the Dark.'' He began, however, with the real story of a 60-ish
Oregon woman who set out to rid herself of an abusive 40-ish
boyfriend by implicating him in the gruesome murder of a young
woman that she knew he did not commit.
</P>
<P>
   Her testimony was so convincing that the boyfriend was convicted
for the killing. But she seemed to know so much about the crime
that she was found guilty of being an accomplice. They were in
prison when the real murderer began confessing in anonymous letters
adorned with smiley faces.
</P>
<P>
   Pielmeier changed the location to Michigan and named the woman
Lorraine Petrovich and the boyfriend Rusty Zuvic. Rusty is
portrayed by Nicholas Campbell as a one-dimensional monster: even
if he isn't a murderer, he's rotten enough to be one.
</P>
<P>
   Lorraine, who ought to be the story's center, is portrayed as a
no-dimensional cipher by Ann-Margret. She plays against type as a
dowdy grandmother whose ruse is inspired by ``Matlock'' and ``Perry
Mason.'' But in place of her usual perky sexiness, she exudes,
well, nothing.
</P>
<P>
   What does Lorraine really feel about Rusty and what she has done
to him? How does this seemingly simple, passive woman find the sly
intelligence to mislead the authorities so convincingly? If
Ann-Margret has any ideas, she's not telling.
</P>
<P>
   She is telling her ever changing story of the events surrounding
the death, and that inspires Rusty to keep changing his own version
of the fateful night. He even confesses in a vain attempt to save
himself. Then, for some unexplained reason, Lorraine confesses,
too. Each retelling is dramatized in every grim, gory detail until
the viewer gives up trying to look for the truth.
</P>
<P>
   In the production's publicity notes, the director, Brian
Trenchard-Smith, describes the film as ```Rashomon' meets `Fargo'
by way of `Twin Peaks.''' What, no ``Gone With the Wind'' or ``The
Brady Bunch'' elements?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Trenchard-Smith, whose own films include ``Dead-End
Drive-In'' and ``Leprechaun 4 _ In Space'' was aiming too high. But
he and Pielmeier offer too many stretches of soapy, standard-issue
dramatics where the mordant wit should be. Still, while this effort
never quite comes together, it has its redeeming elements.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among them are the wholly fictitious characters of the
investigators who at first believe Lorraine's story and finally
begin to see the holes in it. As a counterpoint to Lorraine and
Rusty, Pielmeier has created another older woman-younger man pair,
but a younger older woman-younger man pair.
</P>
<P>
   Jen Powell (Marg Helgenberger) is a tough, dedicated police
detective (``This job is about passion, not ambition'') with a
heart that's soft enough to take in stray dogs. (One piece of
genuinely quirky humor: She gives the dogs names like Jesse Helms,
Kenneth Starr and Janet Reno.)
</P>
<P>
   Another stray is forced on her when a naive young criminologist,
Dylan McCarthy, becomes her unwanted assistant. Dylan, played by
Henry Thomas (the alien's little pal in ``E.T.''), is a nail-biting
mess when Jen takes him under her wing. In the course of the movie,
the two build a rapport, both professional and personal, as she
helps make a man of him.
</P>
<P>
   In a film that more than earns its R rating with depictions of
sadistic sex entwined with brutal, bloody violence (plus nudity and
coarse language), the only real sexual tension flows between Jen
and Dylan, who genuinely like each other and never so much as
touch. These two characters, and these two actors, could easily
carry a television series.
</P>
<P>
   But they can't quite compensate for the shortcomings of this
movie. When it's over, you understand how much effort went into it,
but you somehow don't care. Go figure.

`ALL THE LITTLE ANIMALS' TOLD SIMPLY, BEAUTIFULLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
Our rating: 3 stars 
By MARLA MATZER 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
LOS ANGELES _ Against all odds, ``All the Little Animals'' works.
The film combines a first-time screenwriter, Eski Thomas, and a
first-time director, Jeremy Thomas. Granted, the husband-and-wife
team aren't exactly film neophytes: Jeremy Thomas was born into a
filmmaking family and has produced such critically acclaimed
independent films as Bernardo Bertolucci's ``The Last Emperor'' and
David Cronenberg's ``Naked Lunch.'' Still, the two turn what could
have been a heavy-handed manifesto on environmentalism into an
honest and affecting story of a young man's awakening to both his
human potential and the beauty of nature.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The film is based on the book of the same name by Walker
Hamilton, written two decades ago. Bobby (the fine Christian Bale
of ``Metroland'' and ``Velvet Goldmine'') is an upper-class young
Londoner who's somewhat slow and childlike because of a head injury
he suffered in a childhood accident. When the film starts, his
mother, who has been his loving protector and friend, has just
died. He's left in the care of his hateful stepfather, played by
the well-cast Daniel Benzali (of TV's ``Murder One'').
</P>
<P>
   After undergoing some psychological torture by his stepfather
that is, mercifully, fairly brief, Bobby runs away from his
family's palatial London estate. On the road, he meets Mr. Summers,
played by John Hurt with his usual, powerful subtlety. Mr. Summers
has dropped out of society to live in a cabin in the woods; he's
made it his mission to protect animals, and to bury those that have
been killed by cars on the roads.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Summers turns out to be a bit of a case himself: We find out
that he broke from society after committing a murder and taking
money from the bank where he worked. But his kindness toward Bobby
turns out to be just what the young man needs. Bobby comes out of
himself, becoming a much happier and better-adjusted person in his
life with Mr. Summers. There are some lovely moments here, along
with some beautiful nature photography.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Bobby's idyll comes to an end. His stepfather, who
he calls ``The Fat'' but whose real name is De Winter (a bit of
heavy symbolism, glossed over in the film) makes one last attempt
to crush his spirit and his life. But Bobby escapes, and ends up
carrying on the ``work'' of Mr. Summers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fairly simple story, nicely told. Much of it is a little
painful to watch, but in the end, the message is one of hope. The
film's lovely images and gentle message linger. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ John F. Kennedy Jr. died only seven weeks ago, and
his face still adorns slick magazines and quickie paperbacks
seeking to capitalize on the sentimental orgy that followed his
plane crash on a dark night off the coast of Martha's Vineyard,
Mass.
</P>

   But the summer's outpouring of grief and nostalgia is already
fading, replaced by the unromantic, gritty reality of the tragedy's

is positioning herself for a possible wrongful death suit. And
training standards for private plane pilots are being scrutinized.

<P>
   We have moved beyond the overblown mourning and myth-recycling
that marked the loss of America's prince and his wife Caroline
Bessette Kennedy on July 16. Our emotions are drained. The
long-running Kennedy family saga still fascinates, but its
relevance to our own busy lives is inherently remote.
</P>
<P>
   Something similar happened in Britain on Tuesday when the second
anniversary of the death of Diana, princess of Wales, passed with
barely a notice. The outpouring of public adoration immediately
after her death with her boyfriend Dodi in a Paris automobile crash
turns out to have been had a short shelf life.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy family conducted itself with sorrowful dignity after
JFK Jr.'s death, carefully controlling media access and avoiding
either an overt display of emotion or a regal chilliness that could
have fueled public passion. The Kennedys ducked the public
relations circus that would have been inevitable had they buried
him at Arlington Cemetery near his father and mother, tactfully
sending his body back to the sea instead. They kept television
crews at a distance and refused to authorize high-visibility
commemorative events.
</P>
<P>
   And thus far there is no indication that grim secrets of JFK
Jr.'s private behavior will come tumbling out to tarnish an
admirable image of a decent, if pampered, young life well-lived.
</P>
<P>
   The memory of Diana as glamorous superstar, by contrast, has
been sharply revised by post-mortem revelations that portray her as
erratic, selfish, paranoid and a bit batty. A recent book,
``Diana,'' by Sally Bedell Smith makes a strong case that the
princess was not only a congenital liar but had a borderline
personality disorder and was in desperate need of psychiatric
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Her funeral drew the largest global television audience in
history _ as had her fairytale wedding to Prince Charles 18 years
earlier. People queued up for as many as 16 hours to sign books of
condolences, and 1.3 million bouquets were laid at the steps of the
royal palaces. A memorial fund was set up to provide money for her
favorite charities, and her brother established a for-profit museum
at Althorp, her family home, where she is buried.
</P>
<P>
   But this year there were no special prayer services, no flag was
lowered to half-staff and only a handful of the curious showed up
to peer at the royal palaces. Her charitable fund is dying, plans
for a monument have been shelved and tickets to Althorp go begging.
British bookstores report that Diana biographies are longer big
sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Charles, once the ogre of this story, is now viewed more
kindly and seen frequently in public with his lover Camilla Parker
Bowles. The British, who disapproved of her while Diana was alive,
still don't care much for her but are increasingly receptive to a
possible marriage.
</P>
<P>
   But the worst may be yet to come. Princess Di had admitted to
having an affair with James Hewitt, a cavalry officer who played
polo with Prince Charles. Hewitt has cranked out a kiss-and-tell
book due for publication next month that reportedly includes love
letters written to him by a besotted Diana. The book raises the
possibility that her younger son, Prince Harry, is Hewitt's rather
than Charles' child.
</P>
<P>
   The Windsor family tree has many illegitimate branches, but a
scandal of this megabomb magnitude would polish off Diana's
reputation for good. If DNA tests proved Hewitt's paternity,
motherless Harry would be bumped from the line of royal succession
and the only father he has ever known would be suddenly not
genetically related at all.
</P>
<P>
   Insofar as we know, nothing as dramatic and sordid will appear
to destroy JFK Jr.'s memory now that he is not around to defend
himself. He wisely remained single until he found the woman he
really wanted to marry. He may have used bad judgment on his final
airplane flight but he was not an irresponsible airhead, as Diana
clearly was.
</P>
<P>
   But who knows? President Kennedy's biographies certainly rewrote
history. And the JFK Jr. biographies have yet to be written.

PATIENTS NEED HEALTH ADVOCATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH SHERMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you are even thinking about getting sick,
don't! Due to the demands and limits set up mainly by HMOs, medical
care has become sort of the Russian Roulette of client services.
</P>
<P>
   If you happen to push the right button, you get care. If not,
you wait, you wait, you wait and you wait. Just getting in to see
your primary care physician (a.k.a. doctor) is difficult. And if
you need to see a specialist, don't think you can just make an
appointment.
</P>
<P>
   No, first you have to get approved to get a referral. Then you
have to actually get the referral. If it turns out the specialist
never got the referral from your doctor, odds are you won't be seen
on the day of what you thought was your appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the country, medical systems are overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   Costs are rising. To help eliminate these problems, the best
thing to cut out, apparently, is the patient. The drill goes like
this: You have a problem with your foot and you need to renew a
prescription painkiller. First you have to call your primary care
physician. You call.
</P>
<P>
   You get a recorded message with a menu of options. All of them
lead to being put on hold. You then wait anywhere from 10 minutes
to half an hour. Once you do get through, you usually speak to a
harried desk person who tells you the doctor has no appointments,
will only be in two days that week, is in surgery or is on
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   As to your prescription renewal, you're flatly informed that you
cannot speak directly to your doctor (in case you have a question
about why, after taking your pills, your foot seems to be turning
interesting colors or you have a peculiar tingling feeling when you
wiggle your toes).
</P>
<P>
   If you're lucky, you're told you'll be called back by a nurse or
nurse practitioner (don't hold your breath). If you're not so
lucky, you get cut off, and the whole process starts again.
Recently, I tried to renew a painkiller for my husband. He just had
his shoulder rebuilt. He needed more than a bullet to bite on to
relieve the pain. When I called his doctor, I got the usual
plethora of message options.
</P>
<P>
   I tried all of them. What I got was either recorded messages
that cut me off, or references to other recordings (which also cut
me off). When I did manage to reach the prescription renewal line,
that recording informed me that I should call my pharmacist, who,
in turn, should fax the request to the doctor, who would then fax
them the authorization (I never did get to speak to a real person).
</P>
<P>
   After conducting a small (admittedly, unscientific) survey of
pharmacists in the San Francisco Bay Area, I found out that up to
40 percent of doctors now refuse to speak directly to pharmacists
and insist on communicating solely by fax. This means that if the
staff is busy, or in extended meetings (as happened to us), then
they may not even get to the faxes until late that night or the
following day.
</P>
<P>
   Some medical providers are starting to come up with innovative
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The Kaiser system has instituted an urgent care program for
cases that are not true emergencies but need immediate attention.
</P>
<P>
   You can get an appointment the day you call. It's a step in the
right direction.
</P>
<P>
   But it's only the beginning. What people actually now need are
advocates who can cut through the obstacles and get patients help.
This is true for in-patient (hospital) care as well as for
out-patient cases.
</P>
<P>
   Having an advocate can actually be even more crucial in the
hospital, where patients often are scared and disoriented.
</P>
<P>
   I saw this happen with my father. He had gone into the hospital
solely for observation for possible neurological problems. I was
there when a nurse bustled in, carrying an armful of medical
paraphernalia. When I questioned what she was doing, she said she
had to give my dad a cardiac catheterization.
</P>
<P>
   Being a medical, as well as a general writer, I knew about that
test and told the nurse he didn't need it. Obviously under
pressure, she became angry and ordered me to get out of her way and
out of the room.
</P>
<P>
   When I refused and asked to speak to a doctor, the nurse dashed
out, with a look of intense hate in my direction. She returned 10
minutes later, muttered, ``Wrong patient,'' and fled the room.
</P>
<P>
   Now what would have happened if I hadn't been there to be my
father's advocate that day? It's possible, as he was in a weakened
state, this invasive test could have killed him.
</P>
<P>
   I've heard similar stories from friends and acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   I believe we are left with a clear mandate to push for more
humane care.
</P>
<P>
   We have to pragmatically study how to cut costs without cutting
out the patient. This is why we have legislators and oversight
groups. We can't wait for someone else to get the ball rolling.
It's up to each of us to speak up and push for change.

VERSATILE ACTRESS DOING ALL RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's a season of extremes for Sarah Jessica
Parker. The summer has been filled with both good news and bad for
the petite, versatile actress, but as she'll be the first to admit,
variety is the catalyst for creativity.
</P>
<P>
   First, the good news. ``Sex and the City,'' the uncensored HBO
comedy series on which she stars and serves as executive
consultant, has earned two Emmy Award nominations _ for outstanding
comedy series and for Parker's own lead performance. Her
actor-husband Matthew Broderick is also having a great year with
the kiddie hit ``Inspector Gadget'' and the critically acclaimed
``Election,'' as well as the successful New York stage run of
``Night Must Fall'' to his credit.
</P>
<P>
   But one of Parker's former boyfriends _ John F. Kennedy Jr. _
died tragically and another _ Robert Downey Jr. _ has been
imprisoned for his drug addiction. And in a far less devastating
development, Parker's own kiddie comedy, a live-action version of
Jay Ward's cartoon classic ``Dudley Do-Right,'' bombed at the box
office.
</P>
<P>
   While she understandably does not wish to dwell on Kennedy's
death and Downey's imprisonment on drug-related charges _ ``I hope
you understand, I think it's inappropriate and vulgar the way
people have talked about all this stuff,'' she says, apologetically
but succinctly _ Parker is typically enthusiastic and loquacious
about other matters.
</P>
<P>
   Even ``Do-Right,'' a broad slapstick farce that's leagues away
from the stage-trained actress's sophisticated norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appeal was, as always, to do something different,'' says
Parker, 34, whose films have generally run along the more adult
lines of ``Ed Wood,'' ``Honeymoon in Vegas,'' ``L.A. Story'' and
``Do-Right'' director Hugh Wilson's ``The First Wives Club.''
``There aren't a lot of opportunities for women to do comedy, and
there are fewer opportunities for women to do slapstick comedy. And
it was just, simply, fun _ liberating and silly and a great way to
make a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Stalwart Brendan Fraser, who plays the straight-arrow, dimwitted
title Mountie opposite Parker's updated, self-assertive
damsel-in-distress Nell Fenwick, confirmed that the actress was fun
to work with but nonetheless a pro all the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sarah is so funny,'' he says, ``but so intelligent in her
choices. She always has a cool head about her and a real eye on the
ball _ all the time _ when she's making a film.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker's professionalism goes back to childhood, when she began
acting, singing and dancing in stage and television productions in
the Cincinnati area (where, ironically enough, her mom didn't let
her watch TV programs like ``Dudley Do-Right''). She headlined
``Annie'' for two years and, later, enjoyed brief runs on such
acclaimed network series as ``Square Pegs,'' ``A Year in the Life''
and ``Equal Justice.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Parker has focused primarily on film and
Broadway, where she's won raves for ``Once Upon a Mattress,''
``Sylvia'' and the revival of ``How to Succeed in Business Without
Really Trying'' with Broderick.
</P>
<P>
   But the 2-year-old ``Sex in the City'' has brought Parker back
to the tube in a big way, albeit a far different one than she
remembers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The change is that there's HBO,'' she says of the cable
network, which is increasingly betting on risky, adult-oriented
original series such as ``The Sopranos'' and ``The Chris Rock
Show,'' and winning plaudits and ratings points by doing so. ``I'm
not opposed to working for network television, but with HBO there
is more freedom. We can straightforwardly discuss sexual issues
from a female point of view and, hopefully, do it in a way that's
really smart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the intensity and the concentration of conversation
that's different,'' Parker says of ``City,'' which co-stars Kim
Cattrall, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis and is very loosely based
on Candace Bushnell's New York Observer column. ``We just haven't
heard women talk this way, which is not like talking in a dirty way
but just sharing and revealing in a funny way _ in an offhanded way
and a serious way and a focused way.''
</P>
<P>
   And, as the title indicates, a sexy way. Copulation and nudity
commonly punctuate the half-hour comic gabfests, although Parker's
character, Carrie _ a sex columnist like Bushnell _ has managed to
remain covered-up and kept her lovemaking techniques to viewer's
imaginations through the first two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Sex and the City'' is considered part of the vanguard
of television's new age of explicitness, a label Parker finds
somewhat unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel misunderstood,'' she says with a self-joshing laugh.
``It's easy to make assumptions, because people don't see our show
as much (as they would if it were on a broadcast channel). They
hear `Sex' in the title, which is very provocative and titillating.
But, in fact, if the show were merely soft-core porn, then it
wouldn't have gotten an Emmy nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``And my character has, basically, been with one guy for two
years,'' she adds, correctly. ``I constantly see poor Matthew on
talk shows getting asked, `How do you feel about your wife jumping
in and out of bed on TV?' I think, women jump in and out of bed on
television all the time, and I don't even take my clothes off. But
it's this idea, rather than anything actually seen on the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the attention a hint of scandal brings can be a good
thing, too. Parker is still amazed that her little cable show _
which is shot on film in New York, where she's lived and worked for
more than a decade _ has been appreciated by the L.A.-based Academy
of Television Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   As has she.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my first Emmy nomination, and it's thrilling,'' Parker
says of being a contender for the outstanding actress in a comedy
series statuette (the Emmy Awards will be presented Sept. 12).
``The whole thing was just so unexpected and a wonderful surprise.
I have no illusions about the reality of winning, but in our case,
that old saw of `it's great just to be nominated' really, I feel,
applies. We were so far away, and I didn't know people out here
were paying attention to the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, to have it acknowledged is a thrill. And to be sitting in
the company that we'll be in that night _ we just need to go there
and have a blast, because it may never happen again. Who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   With an attitude that sunny, it's little wonder that nothing
much gets Parker down. But can the same be said for Broderick
whenever Parker gets so much attention, actors' egos being what
they are and all?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been making Norman Maine jokes since the day we met,''
Parker laughs, referring to the ``A Star Is Born'' character whose
career self-destructs as his wife's blossoms. ``I still think
they're funny, by the way ... and then I say, (in a tremulous,
melodramatic voice) `I'm Mrs. Matthew Broderick!' But you know
what? Matthew's at a beautiful time in his career. He always
pretends like he'll take any job that comes along, but he only is
not working now because he's picky. It's sort of this routine,
acting like he'll never work again.''
</P>
<P>
   As for herself, getting a taste of producing responsibilities on
``Sex and the City'' may mean Parker will not be working quite the
same way she has in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice _ it's nice! _ to feel that you're part of
something, that you aren't just an actor for hire,'' she says.
``That you have something at stake, and you have some
responsibilities. It makes you care a lot more about everybody
around you, their welfare and their well-being, and the quality of
the show and how it's received.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to go back to just acting; it's like putting a gag
on your mouth. But there is a time and a place for everything, and
I think I can separate the two. I hope so.'' &QL;

ANTIQUES: CHINESE GLASS AS STEPCHILD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Antique Chinese glass is a stepchild in the family of
Chinese decorative arts. There are only a handful of scholarly
books on the subject, and few American museums have high-quality
Chinese glass collections. (The outstanding exceptions are the
Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the Corning Museum of Glass in
upstate New York.) Much more attention is paid to Chinese painting,
calligraphy and ceramics from ancient times through the Ming
Dynasty (A.D. 1368 to 1644).
</P>
<P>
   ``Lack of knowledge has made people afraid to touch Chinese
glass,'' said Mostafa Hassan, owner of a Manhattan gallery,
Imperial Oriental Art. Hassan, a former specialist at Christie's,
sells pink, amber, turquoise and ``mutton fat'' white examples of
18th- and 19th-century Chinese glass in his gallery, at 790 Madison
Ave., near 67th Street.
</P>
<P>
   The market for Chinese glass has had dramatic ups and downs. In
the early 1980s it was relatively inexpensive because there was
little demand for it. By the end of the 1980s the market heated up
and the prices for the finest examples increased dramatically. The
stepchild status persists, however. As Sotheby's specialist James
Godfrey said, ``Glass can be a whimsical market.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago two scholars, Claudia Brown and Donald Rabiner,
tried to explain the prejudice against post-Ming Chinese glass. In
``Clear as Crystal, Red as Flame: Later Chinese Glass,'' a catalog
for a 1990 exhibition at the China Institute in America, they
wrote, ``Particular disdain has long been reserved for `late'
Chinese art, that is, works of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown, curator of Asian art at the Phoenix Art Museum, and
Rabiner, an art history professor at Arizona State University who
died in 1992, explained: ``The obvious merits of Qing-period jade,
enamel, lacquer and glass were sadly obscured by the belief that
`late' is but a euphemism for decadent, representing at best the
triumph of technique over good design, and more commonly bearing
witness to a notable decline in workmanship.''
</P>
<P>
   A coming show at Alvin Lo Oriental Art Limited, a gallery at 5
E. 57th St. in Manhattan, may challenge such attitudes. Lo, whose
father, P.C. Lu, was a renowned Hong Kong dealer, has been
collecting glass for 15 years. On Sept. 14 he is opening an
exhibition titled ``18th Century: The Golden Age of Peking Glass,''
which includes 18 pieces, ranging from monochrome examples in egg
yolk yellow, ruby red and opaline green with simple shapes (what is
called ``scholar's taste'') to highly decorative pieces with
multicolored glass overlays.
</P>
<P>
   The Lo exhibition is timed to coincide with Asia Week in New
York, a major period of sales of Oriental antiques. The Doyle sale
is Sept. 13. The ``Art of Pacific Asia'' show runs Sept. 15-18.
Sotheby's sale is Sept. 15 and includes several pieces of later
Chinese glass. Lot 10, for example, is a pair of 19th-century
yellow jars with covers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jars with covers always seem popular with people, because they
like the shape,'' Godfrey said. ``What is also compelling is the
color. Yellow is the most sought after because it is the color
associated with the Chinese Imperial household.''
</P>
<P>
   One lot at Sotheby's is a brush washer. Godfrey called it ``a
typical scholar's object, in that it is more subtle, simple and
less complex.'' The estimates for the glass range from $2,000 to
$10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's ``Fine Chinese Furniture, Ceramics and Works of Art''
sale on Sept. 16 will have little glass, except for a handful of
small bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Lo uses the popular term Peking glass because people associate
Chinese glass with the Imperial Palace workshop and the commercial
glass houses of Beijing. In fact the Chinese have made glass since
about 700 B.C. It is just that glass apparently did not rate royal
patronage until 300 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1696 the second emperor of the Qing Dynasty, Kangxi
(1662-1722), established a glass house within the palace workshops,
apparently after learning that a German missionary in Beijing,
Kilian Stumpf (1655-1720), knew how to construct kilns, formulate
glass batches and work the materials into forms.
</P>
<P>
   The founding of the imperial workshop was ``an event that would
profoundly affect the history of Chinese glass for at least a
century,'' Ms. Brown and Rabiner wrote. ``Imperial patronage
greatly increased the status of this material, whose principal
function had long been the economical imitation of jade and other
hard stones.''
</P>
<P>
   The palace workshops grew productive and glass became very
fashionable, both inside the court and out. Stumpf's influence over
the forms the glass took was short-lived. As Ms. Brown and Rabiner
wrote in the Phoenix Art Museum catalog for the 1987 show ``Chinese
Glass of the Qing Dynasty: 1644-1911'': ``However much technical
assistance the European craftsmen may have lent, few surviving
pieces of Chinese glass owe a discernible debt to European
styles.'' What happened in fact was just the opposite. By the time
of the Qianlong Empire (1736-1795), the Chinese were making glass
in the shapes of traditional Chinese pots, vases, dragon-handled
cups, even statues of horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glassmaking had long encompassed the imitation of hard
stones,'' the catalog continues, ``but now, working side by side
with lacquerers, enamelers and jade craftsmen, glassmen took
inspiration from other crafts.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the Lo exhibition, there are a pair of opaque green glass
cups decorated with bas relief carvings of lotus leaves, birds, and
flowering branches. Lo said that the carved glass cups were made to
imitate carved jadeite. ``Jadeite was always very expensive; it was
a precious material,'' Lo said. ``Peking glass was made to look
like jade, lapis lazuli, turquoise and rose quartz. It imitated
rubies, sapphires and emeralds.''
</P>
<P>
   Collecting Chinese glass can be a tricky enterprise. ``I don't
sell it because it's so easy to copy,'' said Ralph Chait, a veteran
Manhattan dealer in Chinese art.
</P>
<P>
   Lo concurred. ``You have to buy from a reputable source,'' he
said. ``Some of the marks on glass are very deceiving. They could
be from the imperial glass works, but they could also be marks
added in the 20th century. To make matters worse, there are genuine
pieces that have no marks. You have to have a basic understanding
of what pieces would have been marked, and which would not.''
</P>
<P>
   Lo warned that there are fakes on the market. ``In the early
1980s, when I started dealing in 18th-century glass, prices were so
low that it wasn't worth faking,'' he said. ``When prices shot up
in the late 1980's, I began to see decorative pieces with marks
that shouldn't have had any marks. The Chinese do a very good job
at imitating old Peking glass.''
</P>
<P>
   Lo's prices range from $8,500 to $150,000 (for an unusual pair
of glass horses). The show is to continue through Sept. 24.

   DIXIE CHICKS/``FLY'' (Monument/Sony)
</P>
<P>
   Country's answer to Bananarama isn't shy about striking while
the iron is hot. ``Fly,'' the Dixie Chicks' winning major-label
sophomore effort, comes while their multiplatinum-selling debut is
still flapping high on the charts. Instead of heading in an
overproduced pop direction, though, these backwoods breakouts
retain their slick Texas twang and strike rootsy notes of genuine
honky-tonk, country and bluegrass. Fans will welcome lavish,
radio-friendly ballads like ``Cold Day in July,'' ``Cowboy Take Me
Away'' and ``Without You,'' while the convincing shuffle ``Hello,
Mr. Heartache'' and the fiddle-drenched ``Sin Wagon'' proves
commercial country doesn't have to be for the birds. 3 stars

Millionaire mogul Sean ``Puffy'' Combs is a far better talent scout
than artist. That much was evident on his 1997 debut, ``No Way
Out,'' which boasted some fine pop moments but suffered from the
darkness sparked by the murder of pal the Notorious B.I.G. With
fewer memorable moments than the earlier disc, the overly
restrained ``Forever'' finds our hero hijacking cheesy samples _ at
one point even stooping to ``Sailing'' by Christopher Cross _ but
when Combs delivers a bumping party anthem like ``I'll Do This for
You'' (featuring Kelly Price) or ``Angels with Dirty Faces'' (with
Bizzy Bone of Bone Thugs-N-Harmony) all is nearly forgiven. 2 1/2

   A dozen or so big-name guest stars can't be wrong: hip-hop soul
crooner Blige got such giants as Elton John, Babyface and Aretha
Franklin to collaborate on this, her fourth album. But while the
disc generally holds up and features some good material, it doesn't
qualify Blige for the sainthood she's currently enjoying.
</P>
<P>
   Standouts include the joyous love songs ``All That I Can Say''
(written, produced and arranged by Lauryn Hill) and ``I'm in
Love,'' along with the powerful ``Your Child,'' about a woman who
discovers her lover has had a baby with another woman. The latter
tune particularly spotlights Blige's gift for emotional honesty.
But too many of the other tracks open with a novel intro and
stellar pedigree, but devolve into similar-sounding, beat-heavy
ballads. They just aren't as original as the compositions they draw
from, such as John's ``Bennie and the Jets.''
</P>
<P>

generally effective nod to electronic music, dub reggae and
trip-hop. There are also seven conventional numbers, although just
one _ Corgan's prog-rock ballad ``Identify,'' sung by sugary pop
singer Natalie Imbruglia _ was written especially for the film. The
only other new song is Bowie's crunching ``The Pretty Things Are
Going to Hell'' from his forthcoming album. The rest includes

carefully wrought, that album mirrored a twisted, dour mood as
perfectly as Portishead's first recording. Unfortunately,
``Juxtapose'' isn't going to win Tricky any new fans. The disc,
which clocks in at a mere 35 minutes, boasts its share of hip-hop
beats and hooks (thanks to collaborators Muggs of Cypress Hill and
Grease of DMX and the Ruff Ryders) but the results are too
conventional. There are also cliches galore in such unlikely places
as guitar overdubs, rapping and pointless remixes. 1 1/2 stars

``Faithful'' and the title track. Also worth hearing: a hypnotic
update of Jimi Hendrix's ``May This Be Love,'' utilizing a swirling

   LOS ANGELES _ Short and sweet.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to be the motto of more and more artists and producers
today. With compact discs able to hold around 75 minutes of music,
some albums are matching vinyl and clocking in at 40 minutes and
under.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the new Tricky release, ``Juxtapose,'' comes in at
35 minutes. And the recent Latin Playboys disc, ``Dose,'' holds a
little more than the same amount of music.
</P>
<P>
   Latin Playboys member and co-producer Tchad Blake says it's a
case of quality over quantity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like short records,'' Blake said. ``We don't like going
over 45 minutes _ even on someone else's albums. It's been said
that in this case, size (ITAL)does(END ITAL) matter. We like things
that leave you wanting more.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``Dose,'' the theory worked.
</P>
<P>
   Blake, who is joined in the Latin Playboys by frequent producing
partner Mitchell Froom, plus David Hidalgo and Louie Perez of Los
Lobos, says one of the reasons for the length of the moody ``Dose''
was the way the music was created.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very spontaneous,'' he said. ``We were continually
surprised. Mistakes took us down entirely different avenues than we
expected. We wanted to use only the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   We agree it's always better to have a fully realized record
rather than a couple of good tracks and a lot of filler. But with
the price of CDs averaging between $12 and $17, it would be better
for consumers if music makers aimed for a bit more of the good
stuff. &UR;  &QL;

MEGA MAN
</P>
<P>
   Top-rated morning show ``John London and the House Party'' has
moved to Mega 100 _ KCMG-FM (100.3) _ from sister station the Beat.
</P>
<P>
   London has appeared on hip-hop station the Beat _ KKBT-FM (92.3)
_ since 1991 and has remained one of the area's most popular
morning hosts for almost three years. Both Mega 100 and the Beat
are owned by Dallas-based AMFM Inc., the nation's largest radio
broadcasting company with 460 stations in 104 markets.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Rivers, AMFM's programming chief, said Mega 100's
``jammin' oldies'' format is the best place for the London show to
``expand its audience and gain further exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   London said that ``short of experiencing euphoria, I couldn't
imagine anything more rewarding than continuing to entertain my
fans at ... Mega 100.'' &QL;

NEW SCORE ATTACHED TO 1931 `DRACULA'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Philip Glass is not your usual Hollywood hired
hand. Sometimes erroneously referred to as a minimalist composer,
the prolific Glass is anything but, which is why he is such an
interesting choice to write an original score for a classic film
that never had one.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Universal released Todd Browning's 1931 ``Dracula''
on video ($14.98) with a newly written score by Glass. It's
performed by the acclaimed string ensemble the Kronos Quartet.
</P>
<P>
   Glass, who has written everything from operas to symphonic works
to ballets, has too often been given short shrift by classical
critics who dislike his repetitive style, overlooking his use of
rhythm and dynamics to create music that is just as moving as any
from long-dead classical icons. Luckily, as his body of work has
grown, so has Glass' prestige. The recent premiere of his
``Symphony No. 5 (Choral): Requiem, Bardo and Nirmanakaya'' in
Salzburg, Austria, met with strong praise.
</P>
<P>
   With never a shortage of other projects to work on, Glass'
choice of films to score is as interesting and eclectic as the
composer's music. He has worked with such high-powered directors as
Martin Scorsese (``Kundun''), Paul Schrader (``Mishima''), Errol
Morris (``Thin Blue Line'') and Godfrey Reggio on
``Koyaanisqatsi,'' a dazzling cinematic feast that relies totally
on Glass' score. In addition, you probably heard Glass' music in
``The Truman Show'' last year. Not a bad group of films to spend a
couple of evenings viewing on video.
</P>
<P>
   As for why he decided to score a 68-year-old horror film, Glass
explains by saying that ``many films have been made on Dracula
since ... however, none are equal in eloquence or the sheer power
to move us.''
</P>
<P>
   Glass was being a bit kind. ``Dracula'' was served well by
director Browning's strange sensibilities and Bela Lugosi's
alternately mesmerizing and hammy performance. But Browning was no
great shakes as a director. His other notable film was the 1932
``Freaks,'' which used actual circus freaks and was withdrawn from
distribution for a while because of public revulsion. What Browning
lacked in directorial skills, however, he made up for with his eye
for the odd, especially in ``Freaks,'' although he is clearly
sympathetic to his subjects.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Browning, like most directors at the time, had not
yet come to grips with the sound era. ``Dracula,'' which was based
on a stage play, moodily creaks along, punctuated by creepy shots _
whether a close-up of the distorted face of Lugosi or a slithering
snake _ that makes your skin crawl a bit. Later on, Browning did a
much better undead story, also with Lugosi, the 1935 ``Mark of the
Vampire,'' but by then his career was on the wane.
</P>
<P>
   Glass' evocative new soundtrack points up both the strengths and
weaknesses of the film. (The original film did not have a score,
though bits of Tchaikovsky's ``Swan Lake'' were used sparingly _ in
case you swear there was music). At times, Glass' sweeping music
clashes with the slow-moving action, making it more apparent how
hamstrung Browning was by the awkward way sound was recorded at the
time; other times Glass' music will enliven a scene, such as the
trip up to Castle Dracula. At its best, Glass' music, while
maintaining his distinctive sound, meshes with the macabre nature
of the film.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, tampering with a supposed ``classic'' will rankle
some film buffs the way colorization did, but there are
differences.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with colorization is that black-and-white films are
lit differently during filming, and the colorization only served to
illustrate that, usually in an annoying fashion. But ``Dracula''
came out in that in-between era when sound systems were still being
installed in many theaters, and it was actually shown as a silent
film in some places. The film's lack of a score was due more to
primitive technology than choice. And now there is more than
cinematic curiosity and camp for reasons to watch ``Dracula'': a
provocative soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   For Halloween, Glass and the Kronos Quartet, which recently
replaced its cellist, will perform the score for ``Dracula'' during
screenings of the film on Oct. 30 and 31 at UCLA's Royce Hall. Film
purists may call it a trick, but it's really a treat. &UR;  &QL;

   MARINE RESEARCH: ``Sounds From the Gulf Stream'' (K Records).
</P>
<P>
   With songs that start out cooing ``la la la la la'' or ``doo doo
doo doo doo, ba ba bada pa,'' and guitars that bring back the
reverb settings of 1960s spy soundtracks, Marine Research cheerily
takes its place among the pop revivalists of the 1990s. Four of the
five band members were in the English group Heavenly, and Marine
Research retains Heavenly's old combination of cleverness and
modesty. In genially imperfect voices, Amelia Fletcher and Cathy
Rogers sing about the yearnings of the unglamorous and about
romances that aren't quite working out, as lovers strive for ``the
pretense at calm with the chaos inside.'' Meanwhile the tunes lilt
through blithe, unaggressive pop, from early Merseybeat to
syncopated French ye-ye. Marine Research doesn't pretend to be
naive, but it's confident that heartbreak can be contained by
insouciance.

`WEST BEIRUT': COMING OF AGE IN A WAR ZONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With an eye for affectingly quotidian detail, Ziad Doueiri makes
``West Beirut'' a largely autobiographical account of war brewing
in his native Lebanon, circa 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the first years of the civil war, despite the anxiety
that I could sense in my parents, I was incapable of feeling it
myself,'' he has said about the events described here. ``I wasn't
born with fear; I acquired it.'' His film describes how that
happened, step by step.
</P>
<P>
   Doueiri (who has worked as a cameraman on films by Quentin
Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, and has the visual ingenuity those
credits suggest) casts his younger brother in its central role.
</P>
<P>
   Rami Doueiri plays the teen-age Tarek, the only son of parents
who dote on him. In this household, where the parents are worldly
and opinionated, Tarek's complaints about attending a French school
are a main source of strife until larger crises abruptly leave
their mark.
</P>
<P>
   With the April 1975 massacre of a busload of civilians, Beirut
is suddenly on its way to becoming a war zone. It becomes a divided
city, with military checkpoints even for a Muslim native like
Tarek's father (Joseph Bou Nassar) and danger zones where not even
the most intrepid schoolboy ought to go.
</P>
<P>
   But neither Tarek nor his friends are inclined to play it safe
or take no for an answer. So they roam through the city guided by
the factors that most matter to them, like finding a place that
will develop Super 8 movies they furtively took of an older man's
sexy new girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   At first they travel blithely, but the film shows how the war
affects even happily indifferent teen-agers. It's no longer easy
for a Muslim like Tarek to be smitten with May (Rola al-Amin), who
wears a crucifix around her neck. And Tarek's friend Omar (Mohammed
Chamas), who instigated taking the naughty pictures and has an
``Airport 1975'' poster in his room, is suddenly being told by his
newly fundamentalist father that he must fast for Ramadan and give
up theater, cinema and rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   With a feisty, believable performance from his brother Rami,
Doueiri's film gradually shows its hero coming of age while war
destroys all the ordinariness in this teen-ager's life. It watches
as the rubble piles up, the streets grow more dangerous and the
kindly local grocer has to cope with a desperate bread line. ``West
Beirut'' registers these changes in sometimes predictable, dutiful
fashion, but there's no mistaking the grief at the heart of its
story.
</P>
<P>
   The film's English subtitles sometimes inject levity where it's
least expected, as with ``Holy-moly macaroni!'' or ``You're
shish-kebabing me!'' or ``You drive like Steve McQueen!'' The boys'
piquant exclamation at the sight of a beautiful woman is ``What a
piece of lamb!''

   A Mild-Mannered Mountie Turns (Whoops!) Dastardly
</P>
<P>
   Dudley Do-Right
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Fraser, Sarah Jessica Parker, Alfred Molina, Eric Idle,
Alex Rocco, Robert Prosky
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Hugh Wilson
</P>
<P>
   PG _ 90 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Being Dudley Do-Right ( Fraser), the dim Canadian Mountie based
on Jay Ward's animated character, it's a given that he climbs on
his horse backward and smashes himself in the face by stepping on
loose floorboards. But if he is to best the crafty Snidley Whiplash
(Molina) and secure the affections of Nell Fenwick (Ms. Parker),
Dudley needs a personality do-over.
</P>
<P>
   Snidley is such a popular mustachioed bad guy that his gang is
too large to fit into a bank during a holdup and must crowd around
in the street awaiting word of what is happening inside. In his
role as illegitimate businessman he seeds the streams of Semi-Happy
Valley with enough gold to start a rush that will enrich his many
interests.
</P>
<P>
   What Do-Right can't understand (or part of what he can't
understand) is why everybody loves Snidley. Even Nell hedges her
bets and rides Snidley's arm at the lavish Las Vegas-style floor
shows he puts on with the Kumquat Indians. Then Dudley's ragtag
prospector friend (Idle) comes through with this piece of useful
advice: Quit being so nice and get dangerous. Suddenly in black
leather, Do-Right jumps on a big dirt bike and rallies the Kumquats
for a battlefield showdown. At least Nell gets a kick out of it.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE _ Snidley does things like set up meetings between the
railroad and the bank president _ i.e., tying the bank president to
the tracks _ and he stages a Normandy-type frontal assault on
Dudley and the Kumquats, who take to the trees and throw rocks. But
these are buffoons at play in a plainly unreal context, and if
people are hurt, they don't stay that way.
</P>
<P>
   SEX _ Whiplash is after what Nell has to offer in this
department and Dudley, if he is even aware of sex, might be too,
but despite some passing references (``Is Dudley studly?'') nothing
develops.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY _ An off-color exclamation or two, but really none to
speak of.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-5 _ They're a little young, but some children get some
big laughs from the simpler silly business.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 6-10 _ They'll love it.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11 AND UP _ Viewers reared with the Ward characters Rocky,
Bullwinkle and George of the Jungle will appreciate some of the
subtler elements here. Some teen-agers will gravitate; others
won't.
</P>
<P>
   A Dog of Flanders
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy James Kissner, Jesse James, Jack Warden, Jon Voight,
Farren Monet, Madyline Sweeten, Cheryl Ladd
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Kevin Brodie
</P>
<P>
   PG _ 90 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Another film version of Ouida's classic tale hits every
conceivable he's-up-he's-down element of children's heroic
storytelling with total predictability and overwhelming
sentimentality. First there is a mother, Anna (Ms. Ladd),
staggering with a babe in arms through a blizzard to Grandpa's
cottage, where she expires after exhorting the old man ( Warden) to
raise the boy, named Nello, with her memory in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Anna was an artist of unrecognized talent, and it is apparent
that her small son (played by both Jeremy James Kissner and Jesse
James) has the same bent and then some. But for the most part
Nello's life is restricted to Grandpa's milk run.
</P>
<P>
   So call central casting. Cue the little friend, Aloise (Farren
Monet and Madyline Sweeten), and a large, shaggy dog, Patrasche,
who is found beaten by the roadside. Cue the nasty landlord, who
threatens to boot Nello and Grandpa into the street if they don't
come up with the rent. Cue Patrasche's brutal and drunken former
owner, who wants the animal back.
</P>
<P>
   On the brighter side, Nello gets noticed by the renowned painter
Michel La Grande ( Voight). Everybody worships Peter Paul Rubens
(the artist having come from these parts) and with Michel's fervent
encouragement, Nello decides to enter the Rubens competition.
``Genius is a greatness that burns like an eternal flame,'' says
Nello's new benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   Right, but stand by for a packed agenda of bad turns and good:
an accusation of arson; the actual eviction, with Nello getting
tossed out into yet another blizzard; the appearance of Rubens in a
feverish vision. Is Nello really a rich kid?
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE _ Defending Nello, Patrasche attacks his former owner
and kills him (by accident, naturally), and the maltreatment of
people is violent in spirit.
</P>
<P>
   SEX _ None.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY _ None.
</P>
<P>
   FOOTNOTE _ In a film headed quickly for the video racks, a sense
of deja vu may stem from the fact that this story has been aped, or
at least cannibalized for parts, by other children's stories. In
any event, it all seems shopworn by now.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-5 _ Anna's death and some of Nello's other tribulations
will upset small children, who will be at sea anyway, particularly
during all the tiresome moralizing.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 6-10 _ Younger viewers in this category may sit still, but
many older ones will be longing for the exit.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11 AND UP _ Too gloppy and paralyzingly old-fashioned.
</P>
<P>
   Chill Factor
</P>
<P>
   Cuba Gooding Jr., Skeet Ulrich, Peter Firth, David Paymer
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Hugh Johnson
</P>
<P>
   R _ 110 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Some standard very-late-summer action fodder finds two low-end
heroes, Arlo ( Gooding) and Mason ( Ulrich), trying to keep a
chemical weapon container from rising above 50 degrees. Otherwise
it will blow and kill three million people. Make that five million.
</P>
<P>
   That's right _ ``Speed,'' only Fahrenheit. Standing between the
boys and their bags of ice cubes is Brynner ( Firth), an embittered
Army man who wants to sell the material for $100 million. Unjustly
held responsible for a slight eruption of the weapon (18 dead)
during tests on a Pacific island, Brynner served 10 years at
Leavenworth. Now he has emerged with a murderous crew of commandos
and without much of his sanity.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, a fly fisherman and soda jerk with an arrest record
(vagrancy and the like), is a nice enough lad. Arlo does a lot of
mugging (to suit Gooding), talks in obscene cliches and comes with
an ice cream truck, which is handy for refrigeration. The
government sends in the Rangers. Yes, we're up to 49 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE _ Flesh melts at contact with the chemical, and there
are plenty of explosions, shootings and throat slashings.
</P>
<P>
   SEX _ None.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY _ Base and plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 11 _ The heroes are overgrown adolescents and the film
is often played for laughs, which will make it appealing. But no.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11-14 _ Remember the R rating, but this film is no more
objectionable than countless others just like it. That doesn't make
it suitable, however. Parents' decision.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 14 AND UP _ It's the usual story: children who want to see
the film probably will.  &QL;

TELLING IT LIKE IT IS, KNOCKING 'EM DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Perhaps the funniest moment in ``Jar the Floor,'' a
play packed with insults, put-downs and four generations' worth of
familial invective, comes without a word being spoken.
</P>
<P>
   It happens midway through the first act. Lola, a snappy
grandmother, and MaDear Dawkins, a feisty great-grandmother, are
shocked into near-paralysis by the appearance of Vennie, Lola's
bald granddaughter, and her friend, an over-eager divorcee whose
first stab at rapport involves an offer to show off her mastectomy
scar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor to meet you, Ms. Dawkins,'' the visitor says.
``Would you like me to take off my shirt so you might have a better
look?''
</P>
<P>
   MaDear's mouth drops open, Lola's eyes go wide, and the
audiences generally go crazy.
</P>
<P>
   The women responsible for this stunned silence are Lynne Thigpen
(as Lola) and Irma P. Hall (as MaDear), two accomplished actresses
receiving some of the best reviews of their careers as a mother and
daughter with plenty to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   The revival of ``Jar the Floor,'' a serious family comedy by
Cheryl L. West at the nonprofit Second Stage, has been extended
through Sept. 12, and there is talk of a longer, commercial run at
a larger theater. Set around MaDear's 90th birthday party, ``Jar
the Floor'' tells the story of four generations of African-American
women, each with a few opinions about how the others are living
their lives. The title refers to MaDear's belief that her dead
husband's spirit can rattle the floorboards.
</P>
<P>
   While there has been praise for the rest of the five-woman
ensemble, which includes Regina Taylor, Welker White and Linda
Powell, many critics have singled out the work of Ms. Hall and Ms.
Thigpen.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in The New York Times, Peter Marks said the play left
audiences ``feeling unexpectedly lighthearted,'' an effect that
``can be traced to the vitality of the performances, starting with
Ms. Thigpen's dynamite Lola and extending to Ms. Hall's
cantankerous MaDear.'' David Kaufman of The Daily News wrote that
``both Hall and Thigpen are giving performances bound to be
remembered at awards time.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways Ms. Thigpen and Ms. Hall seem to represent two
stock characters in theatrical mythology: the veteran and the
newcomer to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thigpen, after all, has adorned stages both on and
off-Broadway for nearly 30 years, dating to a role in the original
production of ``Godspell.'' In 1997 she won a Tony for her work in
``An American Daughter,'' by Wendy Wasserstein.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hall, may be a new face to New York audiences, but she has
had considerable experience elsewhere, both in the living theater
and the theater of living. A grandmother and former Dallas
public-school teacher, she followed a roundabout path over almost
30 years that led her from amateur theatricals in Texas to the New
York stage, where she is making her debut.
</P>
<P>
   On the set of ``Jar the Floor'' it is Ms. Hall who is the
veteran, and with good reason: not only has she played the role of
grandmother in real life, but it is her eighth production of the
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the character, but I don't know her completely,'' said
Ms. Hall, 64, speaking of the 90-year-old MaDear. ``But I've been
studying her a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The director of ``Jar the Floor,'' Marion McClinton, said Ms.
Hall also offered a dose of realism for the other cast members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Irma is that she carries a history for an
entire generation of women with her,'' McClinton said. ``She is the
real deal. There's a lot of actresses that attempt the Southern
matriarch, but she knows what that is because she is one.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thigpen, he said, offered another type of experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's like having Magic Johnson on the team,'' he said.
``She's seeing the whole play, not only her character. There
weren't too many times I had to explain anything to her. She'd say,
`Oh, I got ya,' and then come back with something even better than
I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. West says the play is not autobiographical, but that the
characters are made up of ``bits and pieces of people I've known.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are recognizable women, women you may have passed on the
street,'' she said. ``But oftentimes they are only secondary
characters in plays and movies.''
</P>
<P>
   First produced at Parkland College, in Champaign, Ill., in 1989,
``Jar the Floor'' has played in more than two dozen regional
theaters but has never been seen in New York. For several years
after her play ``Before It Hits Home'' was poorly received at the
Public Theater in 1992, Ms. West avoided having any New York
productions of her work. But at Second Stage, where `'Jar the
Floor'' began in late July, crowds have been running at
near-capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. West's most flamboyant creation is Lola, a former good-time
girl whose first remark to her daughter _ ``You look like somebody
walked on your face last night and they left tracks'' _ pretty much
sums up her attitude toward mothering.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thigpen says she embraced the role of Lola immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's big, and she lives large,'' said Ms. Thigpen, with a
mischievous smile. ``My first impression when I read it was, `How
do you get the energy to do her?' But it's like a locomotive train:
it just gets on track and goes.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said of Ms. Thigpen's career. She arrived in
New York in 1971 as a graduate-school dropout with dreams of
acting, and just three months later landed her first job, in a
little off-Broadway musical called ``Godspell,'' composed by
Stephen Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't start singing until I got to New York,'' Ms. Thigpen
said. ``I went to one singing teacher. He said: `What do you want?
You can sing.'''
</P>
<P>
   She appeared in the off-Broadway run of ``Godspell'' as well as
the national tour and the film. She finally quit the show _ ``I had
enough `Godspell''' _ and suffered her first, and only, serious
doubts about her choice of profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no job for a year,'' she said. ``I couldn't pay someone
to hire me.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The drought was broken by her Broadway debut, in ``The Magic
Show,'' another show with music by Schwartz. Other Broadway roles
followed, including one in ``Timbuktu!'' with Eartha Kitt.
</P>
<P>
   Her critical breakthrough came in 1980, in ``Tintypes,'' a
pastiche of early-20th-century songs performed by actors playing
the entertainers, politicians and other public figures of that era.
(Critics have since said it seemed to be a forerunner of the
musical ``Ragtime.'') The show's reviews were mixed, but one
performer stood out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her name is Lynne Thigpen,'' wrote Walter Kerr in The New York
Times, ``and I don't even have to tell you to keep an eye on her
because you'll find it impossible not to.''
</P>
<P>
   With a strong jaw, piercing eyes and an aura of perpetual poise,
Ms. Thigpen still cuts a striking figure. Her voice suggests deep
reservoirs of control and passion, elements on display in her
performance in ``Jar the Floor'' and ones that have also led to a
successful career as a voice-over artist.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thigpen was nominated for a Tony for ``Tintypes,'' and the
stream of acting jobs continued, including parts in August Wilson's
``Fences'' on Broadway and on the television shows
``Thirtysomething'' and ``L.A. Law.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s she took on a role that made her famous, to
children at least. The part was Chief, the dogged detective on the
PBS show ``Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?,'' inspired by
the computer mystery-quiz game in which a master criminal is
stalked to exotic locales. The show ran from 1991 to 1996, a period
during which Ms. Thigpen was nominated for four Emmy Awards and
commonly stopped on the street with geography questions.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hall was one of her fans. ``It does just happen that I love
geography,'' she said. ``I'd been watching it every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hall's career involved a little traveling, too. Born in a
rural Texas town in 1935 and reared in Chicago, Ms. Hall says her
early life progressed pretty much according to plan: a husband, two
children, a job teaching French and Spanish at a local high school.
</P>
<P>
   But performance was in her blood; her father had been a
saxophone player, a side man in jazz clubs on Chicago's South Side.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, at the urging of Raymond St. Jacques, a director and
actor, Ms. Hall auditioned for a low-budget movie, ``Book of
Numbers,'' about a gambling racket in a Depression-era town.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after that she helped found the Dallas Minority
Repertory, a community theater where she raised money during the
day and acted at night.
</P>
<P>
   She says she was not exactly sure what she was doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd draw pictures of the stage for me,'' she said. ``I
didn't know upstage from outdoors.''
</P>
<P>
   With a sugary Texan drawl, grandmotherly demeanor and a quick,
infectious smile, Ms. Hall won small parts in an array of films,
plays and television shows, and on stage. By 1984, with her
children grown, she retired from teaching to pursue acting full
time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987 she returned to Chicago to care for her ailing parents.
When her mother died, her father delivered a playful ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `All right, time to go to work,''' Ms. Hall said,
noting that she had initially doubted that she had the acting
skills required for important national productions. But her first
major role, as a grandmother in the play ``Zandile,'' won her a
Joseph Jefferson Award, Chicago's highest acting honor. A year
later she won her second Jefferson Award playing a Trinadadian tap
dance student in ``Steppin' Out,'' at the Steppenwolf Theater
Company.
</P>
<P>
   ``And she's been working ever since,'' Ms. Thigpen interjected,
with a laugh and a note of pride. Ms. Hall laughed, too, and
bashfully said: ``It's true. I can't believe it, but it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of her stage time during the 1990s has been in productions
of ``Jar the Floor,'' including runs at the Old Globe in San Diego
and at Syracuse Stage. But none of those peregrinations led to New
York. In 1995 Ms. Hall received strong reviews for her performance
in the film ``A Family Thing,'' playing Aunt T., an 88-year-old
woman who eases the tension between a black man and a white man who
learn they are half-brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love being all these different people,'' she said. ``So long
as they're old people. I love old people.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Ms. Hall and Ms. Thigpen say the ensemble of ``Jar the
Floor'' has become as tight-knit as the family on stage but without
the vitriol. Cast members often share jokes and smokes in the
stairwells outside their dressing rooms, and Ms. Hall has let them
all peek at her ``Me'n'book,'' a collection of photos of Ms. Hall
with fellow actors.
</P>
<P>
   In a play steeped in mothers, daughters and the detritus of
love, such a connection is almost inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all bonded very quickly,'' Ms. Hall said. ``This play
always seems to do that.''

   Thursday afternoon, tropical-storm warnings remained in effect
for the Middle Atlantic Coast from Cape Lookout, N.C., to Cape
Charles Light, Va., as former Hurricane Dennis wobbled slowly over
the Atlantic about 100 miles southeast of Cape Hatteras, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Tropical Storm Dennis will continue to flounder off the
Carolina coast as it sends bands of gusty showers toward shore.
Large ocean swells will batter the coast, with storm-surge flooding
up to 4 feet possible around times of high tide.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, some of the mid- to upper-level moisture
associated with Tropical Storm Dennis will stream inland into
southeast Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and, perhaps parts of southeast
New York, mainly in the form of cirrus and altostratus clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of thunderstorms will flare over parts of the western
Gulf States as an upper-level low pressure system stalls over
Louisiana. Farther north, isolated but potent thunderstorms will
erupt over parts of the central Rockies from southeast Wyoming to
northeast Colorado as moist winds from the southeast are forced to
rise up the sloping terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Severe weather, including isolated tornadoes, is possible.
Storms will migrate east onto the high plains of western Kansas and
Nebraska. Meanwhile, scattered showers and thunderstorms will form
along a front from eastern South Dakota to Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   A chilly rain with temperatures in the upper 40s to 50s will
again make for a rather raw day over parts of Montana.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: TENACIOUS DENNIS
</P>
<P>
   Hurricanes that stall over the ocean usually perish by their own
hand. Like an agitating washing machine, winds associated with a
stalled hurricane continually stir underlying seas. Over time, cool
water from the depths rises to replace warm surface water that is
mixed downward by stirring winds. The surfacing of cool water is
the kiss of death for a stalled tropical system. Though Hurricane
Dennis was downgraded to a tropical storm as it slowed off the East
Coast this week, it has maintained its strength because it stalled
over the persistently warm Gulf Stream ocean current.

AS AFTER WORLD WAR II, JAPAN WILL SURVIVE BY ADAPTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't let the recent proposed megamerger of three Japanese banks
into the world's largest financial institution mislead you. Japan
is still in the depths of its economic doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   Political corruption, economic woes and national feelings of
self-doubt could have described the United States in the 1970s.
Today, those words describe Japan, author Milton Ezrati says.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Japanese now, as for Americans then, it carries the
sense of a lost future, the feeling that the population and
leadership have collectively deceived themselves about who they
are, what they are capable of, how they fit into the world, and,
more importantly, about the character of their society,'' he
writes. ``Despite her past stability, in coming years Japan will
change radically, become more volatile, less predictable, and
possibly even dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan is at a major crossroads, a situation the country has
faced numerous times, most recently after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her utter defeat in the Second World War made it clear that
the imperial-militaristic experiment into which she had flung
herself had failed,'' Ezrati writes. ``Once again the Japanese
responded with a radical shift. Suddenly, as if with one mind, they
abandoned their ferocious devotion to militarism, and began the
single-minded peaceful pursuit of manufacturing, exporting, and
commerce for which they are now well known.''
</P>
<P>
   How Japan will transform itself to meet its current internal and
external pressures is the topic of Ezrati's, ``Kawari: How Japan's
Economic and Cultural Transformation Will Alter the Balance of
Power Among Nations'' (Perseus Books, 294 pages, $26. ``Kawari''
means ``change'' or ``alternative'' in Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   The new Japan will be but a shadow of its old self, the author
asserts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If history is any guide, Japan's transformation, once it gains
momentum, will break completely with the past,'' Ezrati writes.
``Her economic and demographic imperatives will make it
increasingly difficult for her to carry on as the world's workshop.
Her huge trade surplus will shrink into deficit, and her high rate
of savings will fall.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not necessarily bad for the country, however. Ezrati
foresees Japan turning to the rest of Asia for its manufacturing
needs, becoming a ``headquarters nation'' and global center for
management, finance and design.
</P>
<P>
   Such a change will become absolutely necessary if for only one
reason _ lack of factory workers, Ezrati writes. Japan is aging
rapidly: One in four citizens will be older than 65 early in the
next century, and the country's birth rate is historically low.
Japan's emphasis on exporting is simply not sustainable, he writes.
</P>
<P>
   But organizing the country in a new direction is going to be
difficult, given the current political climate, Ezrati writes. Old
management and control techniques, supported and guided effectively
by a bureaucratic system, have failed the country, and public

   ``Recent police data show a 50 percent jump in suicides since
the mid-1990s,'' Ezrati writes. ``Newspapers have begun to report
which Tokyo commuter trains encounter the most suicides.

   Ezrati does an admirable job of explaining the state of this
important country, with chapters on its past and future.

   Ultimately, he believes that Japan will pull itself out of its
economic problems and dire mind-set to thrive again, albeit after
many years of painful transition.

   ``If she wants to protect her economic and national well-being,
she will have to open her economy and her financial markets, cease
her absorbing emphasis on exporting manufactures, decentralize her
approach to economics, allow her industry more freedom to manage
its own affairs, including to move abroad; and develop her domestic
economy into a regional management and service center,'' Ezrati
writes. ``Doing so will transform her from the failed economic
machine that she seems to have become in the late 1990s into a
major power in every sense of that phrase.''

</P>
<P>
   AMACOM, $21.95

27 classic fairy tales from ``Goldilocks'' to the ``Goose with the
Golden Eggs'' to teach basic lessons on management _ from
negotiating contracts to quality work and service. The authors are
corporate consultants and trainers.

ART REVIEW: CHINA'S PASSION, BRUSH STROKE BY BRUSH STROKE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is no art in the world more passionate than
Chinese painting. Beneath its fine-boned brush strokes, ethereal
ink washes and subtle mineral tints flow feelings and ideas as
turbulent as those in any Courbet nude or Baroque Crucifixion.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have always understood art's power. Through it,
rulers advertised their political might and artists registered
their loyalty or resistance. In the ceaseless copying of ancient
masterworks, a unified cultural identity _ some essence of
Chinese-ness _ was invented, reconfirmed, exalted and passed on,
like DNA, from one generation to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, through painting and the closely related art of
calligraphy, the most intense personal emotions, however lofty or
abject, are given voice. Joy and fury, pride and regret, hilarity
and fear are all within its ken, and cannot be as forcefully
expressed in any other medium.
</P>
<P>
   It is no wonder that the practice of art in China is regarded as
a total-immersion vocation, that collecting is an obsessive and
intensely competitive pursuit and that the field of connoisseurship
_ the sorting out of good from bad, real from fake and the many
shades between _ is potentially explosive terrain.
</P>
<P>
   All of these passions, heightened by the aftershocks of a recent
furor, figure in ``The Artist as Collector: Masterpieces From the
C.C. Wang Family Collection,'' an exhibition of nearly 100
paintings, many of exceptional beauty, that opens Friday at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by Maxwell K. Hearn, curator of Asian art, the
paintings fill the museum's Chinese galleries and trace the
evolution of the phenomenally coherent art tradition of which they
are a part. They also share another bond; with two exceptions, they
all are, or once were, the property of the artist and collector
C.C. Wang.
</P>
<P>
   Wang, 92, was born in Suzhou, studied art in Shanghai, has had a
long and fecund career as a painter and now lives in Manhattan.
(Nine of his works appear at the end of the show.) But he is best
known locally for having amassed one of the world's premier private
collections of Chinese classical painting.
</P>
<P>
   Painting, collecting and dealing in art have traditionally gone
hand in hand in China, and Wang has sold much of his collection
over the years. (He has also invested in real estate.) Many of his
pieces have found a home at the Met, including 60 works in the
show. These have been supplemented for the occasion by a handful of
Wang-provenance works from other institutions, loans from the
collector himself and a group of 12 paintings bought in 1997 by a
Met trustee, Oscar Tang, who has promised them to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   One of these gifts _ a towering ink-on-silk scroll over seven
feet tall, titled ``The Riverbank'' and depicting a mountainous
landscape about to be engulfed by a storm _ set off controversy
when it made its public debut two years ago with the opening of the
museum's new Chinese galleries.
</P>
<P>
   The Met introduced it as a work by the 10th-century painter Dong
Yuan, a near-mythical figure who shaped one of the foundational
styles of Chinese landscape tradition. As such, it represented a
tremendous museological coup. But almost immediately sharply
dissenting opinions were heard.
</P>
<P>
   James Cahill, retired professor of Chinese art at the University
of California at Berkeley, who had expressed doubts about the piece
as early as 1980, publicly denounced it as fake and assigned it to
the 20th-century painter, collector and forger extraordinaire Zhang
Daqian (1899-1983). Sherman Lee, retired director of the Cleveland
Museum of Art, backed him up. Phrases like ``China-gate'' began to
pop up on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Debates about authenticity have always been part and parcel of
art in China, where ``originals'' are often chimerical things,
creative copies are revered as supreme masterpieces and
distinctions between copying and forging are fuzzy, sometimes
depending on questions of intention rather than on demonstrable
fact.
</P>
<P>
   But ``fake'' is a word that sends chills through Western
museums, especially when leveled at a high-profile work. The Met,
insistent that it has the genuine article in ``The Riverbank,'' has
put the painting front and center in the current show, accompanied
by a battery of supporting materials.
</P>
<P>
   These include the records of physical analysis to determine age,
and a full-size digital photograph to reveal the scope of
draftsmanship obscured by the darkened silk. (The details that
emerge are amazing.) Also on hand, borrowed from the British
Museum, is a bona-fide Zhang Daqian forgery, a ``10th-century''
landscape actually cooked up sometime around 1951.
</P>
<P>
   What to conclude?
</P>
<P>
   The museum's brief on behalf of its work is highly persuasive.
But for the present it may be wise to suspend judgment until Cahill
and Lee have made their case, which they are to do at a public
symposium at the Met on Dec. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the results will probably be inconclusive. Arguments
like these can spin out forever and all kinds of peripheral
elements _ personalities, grudges, reputations, academic
in-fighting, not to mention the limitations of science _ have to be
considered. So the is-it-or-isn't furor is likely to rage (or
murmur) on.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, though, the Met has surrounded its enigmatic colossus
of a scroll with some extraordinary company: a cluster of
distinguished guests, dozens of familiar faces (the show is
essentially a thematic rotation of the permanent collection with
things added), and a half-dozen of the Tang gifts making their
house debut.
</P>
<P>
   One new arrival is the ``Palace Banquet,'' a narrative painting
by an unidentified artist that has been dated to the politically
unstable years of the late 10th and early 11th century. A large
rectangular piece, delicately colored, it probably was once part of
a screen and depicts a flurry of activity taking place within an
imperial harem just before a ruler's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   The narrative, paced with an eye to suspense, starts toward the
upper right corner, where a young girl is unbolting the gate to the
walled compound. Below, on an open gallery, a table is set with
wine cups and plates. Musical instruments stand at the ready. At
the very center of the picture a woman tiptoes into an inner room
to wake someone _ presumably the emperor's favorite concubine _ who
is seen asleep on a tousled bed.
</P>
<P>
   Various clues suggest that the dinner party is meant to
celebrate the Chinese equivalent of Valentine's Day, when two
prominent stars in the Milky Way move into amorous alignment. The
soft evening light and fluttering figures dressed in coral and
malachite green set up a buzz of slightly breathless sensual
excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the real subject here may be a cautionary one. The women
wear the fashions of the earlier Tang dynasty, during which an
emperor had nearly lost his throne through his desperate
infatuation with a consort. (The woman was finally executed at the
insistence of a mutinous palace guard.) ``Palace Banquet'' may have
been a warning to future rulers not to let history repeat itself.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The other standout figurative work in the show is of a later
date. Titled ``Liu Chen and Ruan Zhao in the Tiantai Mountains,''
it is an ink-on-paper hand scroll by the painter Zhao Cangyun, who
worked in the Yuan, or Mongol, Dynasty of the late 12th and early
13th century at a time when many artists felt that the China as
they had known it had come to a catastrophic end.
</P>
<P>
   The scroll tells of two ordinary men (one carries a basket and a
hoe) who stop one day to sample peaches from a roadside tree and
suddenly find themselves whisked off to a never-never Land
accessible through a cleft in a rock.
</P>
<P>
   There they are cosseted by nymphs and served ambrosial meals,
but they grow restless and ask to leave. A mistake. Once outside,
they discover that seven generations have passed in their absence;
the world is in chaos. They try to return to paradise, but cannot
find the way. Like the Chinese under the Mongol rule, the
implication is they are now strangers in a strange land.
</P>
<P>
   By this point in Chinese art, landscape had, in fact, supplanted
the figure in importance. Yet the narrative impulse never stopped.
One sees it at work in a hanging scroll by the Yuan artist Wu Zhen
titled ``Lofty Virtue Reaching the Sky.'' In it, willow trees
droop, bamboo shoots bend low, and lines of poetry fall like rain
to create an emblem of spiritual endurance against impossible odds.
There isn't a figure in sight, but the picture is saturated with
human emotion.
</P>
<P>
   No artist more distinctively transformed landscape into a state
of mind than Ni Zan (1306-1374), who experienced first-hand the
cataclysmic shift from the Yuan to the Ming Dynasty. He led a
harried existence, living on a houseboat to elude tax collectors.
His paintings are houseboat-size: small, neat-as-a-pin images of
slender trees _ he may have meant them as ``portraits'' of friends
_ set against immaculate expanses of water and sky. In his work, a
messy, violent, adversarial world is given order through art.
</P>
<P>
   Four paintings by Ni Zan are set side by side in the show; some
50 by him survive. It is hard to imagine a better candidate for a
one-man museum show, a la Vermeer, than this artist. He's a
``personality'' painter of a most engaging kind (cranky,
melancholic, funny); his style has instant recognition value, and
Western audiences long accustomed to the variations-on-a-theme mode
of the Impressionist landscape might well be persuaded to give him
a shot.
</P>
<P>
   The febrile, tuning-fork quiver that his work sets up vibrates
elsewhere in the show, sometimes amplified to a volanic pitch. In
``Simple Retreat,'' a tall, narrow scroll by Wang Meng, an artist
who survived briefly into the Ming period, piled-up mountains,
creased with deep, soft folds, resemble a giant beast in the throes
of a convulsion, exuding waterfalls like tears and gasping for air.
</P>
<P>
   It is, at least in part, a crushing, foreboding vision. (Wang
himself, accused of treason, died in a Ming prison.) But within its
tumult, there is joy. Toward the bottom of the scroll, a tiny man
takes a stroll with his pet deer. Another man feeds a snack to a
crane, who dances a little jig. A third man, inside a house,
cradles a magic plant in his hand and sits very still, as if
listening to something but unworried by what he hears. This is a
Peaceable Kingdom, Daoist-style, as carefree as summer even as
autumn touches the trees with vermilion.
</P>
<P>
   An exhibition wall label notes the close resemblance in form and
spirit between this magnetic picture and ``The Riverbank.'' That
Wang Meng should closely emulate the work of the long-dead but
titanic master Dong Yuan makes perfect sense. Countless artists
before him had done so and countless others have since.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a set of album pages still owned by Wang, the 17th-century
virtuoso Shitao tosses off audacious riffs on a dozen Old Masterish
themes and creates a Brice Marden in the bargain. Wang himself,
under his Chinese name Wang Jiqian, carries the tradition into the
present.
</P>
<P>
   Of the paintings by him installed in the lobby just outside the
Chinese galleries, some emulate the luminaries of the past, Dong
Yuan, Ni Zan and Wang Meng among them. Others address the
particular dynamics of modern Western abstraction and retain only
the ghost of calligraphic forms.
</P>
<P>
   Wang is still painting (one piece on view was finished last
year) and though he has stopped collecting, his passionately
acquisitive, discriminating eye is still, directly and indirectly,
shaping the version of Chinese art seen in Western museums today.
</P>
<P>
   Can he have been deceived in ``The Riverbank,'' a work he has
long called his greatest possession? More will be revealed in that
department in December. Meanwhile the Met's Chinese galleries offer
a rich and unimpeachable experience for mind and heart alike.

`ON THE RAZZLE': FINDING A PERFECT MATCH, THANK YOU, WITHOUT
DOLLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Imagine ``Hello, Dolly'' without Dolly Levi, written
by Tom Stoppard in a Catskills-comic style that makes his
``Shakespeare in Love'' script look like Chekhov, and you have ``On
the Razzle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up this morning feeling like a new man, so I got one,''
announces Zangler (Harris Berlinsky), the owner of a
fancy-groceries shop somewhere near Vienna in the 19th century.
When Sonders (Jolie Garrett) announces, ``I love your niece,''
Zangler responds, puzzled, ``My knees, sir?'' You get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Razzle'' is a little odd, but the Jean Cocteau
Repertory has given it a lively production, one that builds to a
satisfying fever pitch by the time all the mistaken identities are
revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the actors are playing everything too broad, but if
you're in the mood for vaudeville, with a few touches of bawdy
double-entendre, you'll be in heaven. If not, you may need a quick
fix of ``Travesties'' to make the world right again.
</P>
<P>
   The story goes back to the original source of ``Hello, Dolly,''
not Thornton Wilder's play ``The Matchmaker'' but the 19th-century
Austrian farce that Wilder based it on: ``Einen Jux Will Er Sich
Machen'' (loosely, ``He's Out for a Fling'') by Johann Nestroy.
</P>
<P>
   The two young men on the town are Zangler's sales clerks:
Christopher (Tim Deak), a callow young apprentice, and the more
mature, more experienced Mr. Weinberl (Craig Smith), who, by the
way, is having an anonymous epistolary romance that began with a
lonelyhearts advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   Zangler has just hired a new servant, Melchior (Jason Crowl, who
has exactly the right deadpan tone and attitude and steals most of
his scenes), and instructed him to arrange a romantic dinner for
Zangler and his fiancee, Mme. Knorr (Elise Stone), at the Imperial
Gardens Cafe in Vienna. Zangler has other things on his mind, like
his niece Marie (Jennifer Lee Dudek), whose guardian he is (``My
ward.'' ``My word!'' ``No, my ward.''), who reciprocates the love
of the far too poor Sonders.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Mr. Weinberl is posing as the husband of Mrs. Fischer
(Angela Madden, who is excellent), a customer of Mme. Knorr's, and
everyone ends up at the Imperial Gardens. Around this time the play
seems to deteriorate into one of the less funny sketches from ``The
Carol Burnett Show,'' but it recovers because Stoppard will beat
you over the head with silliness until you have to admit it's
funny.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sub-subplot about a coachman and a French maid. There
is some frantic concern about the dinner check. And there are
several mentions of an accident on a horse tram on the
Bahnhofstrasse, which leads to a revelation (reminiscent of last
year's romantic summer film ``You've Got Mail''), and just about
everyone ends up happy and paired off.
</P>
<P>
   That includes the niece, who has run away to Vienna, wearing a
long Scotch plaid cape. (Things Scottish having been all the rage
at the time, as the audience learns.) ``I think,'' Mr. Weinberl
pronounces, ``the tartan fad has had its fling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Razzle'' continues at the Bouwerie Lane Theater, with a
schedule that varies from week to week, through Oct. 21.
</P>

 &HT;    Chappell's Kirkman finale heartfelt but hesitant
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 5.
 &HT;    By Eileen M. Drennen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   At his best, North Carolina poet laureate Fred Chappell crafts
the kind of novels other writers greet with envy. A natural
storyteller who hails from Appalachia, he weaves together tall
tales, dreams and visions, and page upon page of pitch-perfect
dialogue into a style that's like the white-lightnin' cousin of
magical realism.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, ``Look Back All the Green Valley'' isn't Fred
Chappell at his best. The fourth and final chapter of the Kirkman
family story cycle _ which has unfolded in the luminous novels ``I
Am One of You Forever,'' ``Brighten the Corner Where You Are'' and
``Farewell I'm Bound to Leave You'' _ is the weakest link. But
perhaps it was foolish to think he could top the heights of those
books, where fact and fiction danced into hills and hollers, and
nature was a mirror of the human heart.
</P>
<P>
   In the first three books, Chappell's fictional alter ego, Jess
Kirkman, acted as central observer of one of the wildest family
trees in recent memory. As a child, most of what he recounted of
kin near and far came straight from the mouths of his grandmother
Annie Barbara, mother Cora or father Joe Robert, and readers grew
accustomed to a rich stew of voices.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Valley,'' Jess is all grown up, a teacher of English at a
North Carolina college, poet and fledgling translator of Dante. His
pen name is Fred Chappell, he likes cabernet in the afternoon and
drives a yellow Toyota called Buttercup. In 1979, he has returned
to the mountain town of his boyhood to help his sister Mitzi tie up
a few loose family ends: what to do about their mother's failing
health; how to unravel the riddles of their father's cobwebbed
workroom, still intact 10 years after his death; how to ensure that
their parents' wishes to be buried side by side are honored _ even
though the family cemetery claims to be out of room.
</P>
<P>
   The first time Jess visits his father's workroom, he is
overwhelmed by ``an ache of loss ... particular sudden moments of
sorrow that hurt like saw teeth across a careless thumb.''
</P>
<P>
   He looks up from the dusty collection of notebooks and
half-formed inventions, out the window into a sunlit meadow, and
realizes, ``The past is never obliterate; it has a patient,
enduring existence where it collects like groundwater in holes and
crevices and hidden lodgements _ in attics and basements, in sealed
trunks and stubborn drawers, in closets and pockets and in
cardboard folders. In these places, its visible colors are bland,
but its secret strength gathers like thunderheads.''
</P>
<P>
   Jess looks for the patient, enduring existence of his father's
inner life in what he left behind, in hopes of bringing him back,
in a way. He goes on wild goose chases through mountain towns named
Featherbed and Sassiefat, enlisting friends and relatives to help
him retrace his father's last travels and encounters. If he can
only connect the dots, he seems to think, he can puzzle out the
riddle that was Joe Robert Kirkman.
</P>
<P>
   One of his father's burning quests was to transform the way
humans understood time. It wasn't, he believed, neat units ticked
off in seconds, hours and days, but ``a living thing, connected
with the cosmos.'' He labored to invent something he called a
``sympathetic horologue'' that could track the motion of time more
organically. If he could succeed, clock shopkeeper and old friend
Dilly Elden confides to Jess, ``it would enable us to live two or
more lives at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Chappell's gift has been that he's allowed us to share so many
memorable lives over the course of this tenderly constructed cycle
of stories. He brought the past to life in a way that was original
and true. In the present of 1979, he seems at a disadvantage. Maybe
the main problem is that the adult Jess does too much of the
talking, and not in the easy prose of the earlier works but in the
self-conscious style of someone who's trying too hard to be
natural.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, when Chappell resorts to the supernatural _ as
when the wind blows the clocks awry in the house where his
grandmother lies dying in ``Farewell I'm Bound to Leave You'' _ it
has been in the service of a larger emotional truth. Time is
forever altered when someone you love dies. But here, his
surrealistic denouement _ involving space travel, roses and a
graveyard joke _ feels uncharacteristically forced. He's in the
same landscape of love and sorrow, but he's lost his footing.

   Ehrman, a professor at the University of North Carolina, uses
some of those historical facts to bolster his theory that Jesus was
an apocalypticist. He asserts that Jesus believed that the world
would come to an end within the lifetime of those to whom he
preached.
</P>
<P>
   It's an interesting theory and one that Ehrman puts forth
convincingly. The most interesting aspect of his book, however, is
his entertaining examination of the evidence. It's as fine and
succinct a gathering of the voluminous Jesus scholarship as you're
likely to find.
</P>
<P>
   He begins with a short history of apocalyptic prophesy in
reverse chronological order, from recent times to the years just
after Jesus' death. There follows a page-turning cataloging of what
we know, historically speaking, and what we don't or can't know. He
explains the biblical sources in a clear and understandable way.
Even more remarkable for a work of this type, he enlivens the way
with welcome doses of levity among the erudition.

<P>
   &QR;  For Common Things: Irony, Trust, and Commitment in America
Today by Jedediah Purdy (Knopf, $22).
</P>
<P>
   Alanis Morissette was castigated for misusing the word
``ironic'' in her song of that title, but Purdy understands it all
too well _ although he's not very fond of it. At the tender age of
24, Purdy has written a thoughtful treatise on the masks we hide
behind, the feelings we quash with ironic detachment and the
detrimental effects of living life at a remove from reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of irony is a quiet refusal to believe in the depth
of relationships,'' Purdy asserts, ``the sincerity of motivation,
or the truth of speech _ especially earnest speech.''
</P>
<P>
   The precocious Purdy _ home-schooled in West Virginia coal
country before continuing his education at Phillips Academy,
Harvard and Yale _ calls for re-engagement in political and civic
life. The widespread notion that public life, especially politics,
no longer matters is a sobering but not surprising one. Cynicism
and a loss of trust in our political leaders are rampant. Irony
shields us from consequence, keeps us from investing too much hope
in things that may fail us.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of our society's ironic disengagement, Purdy
offers Jerry Seinfeld, whom he calls ``irony incarnate. Autonomous
by virtue of his detachment, disloyal in a manner too vague to be
mistaken for treachery.'' We have degenerated into blindered
self-interest, refusing responsibility and a commitment to the
``common things.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Disco Bloodbath by James St. James (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $23).
</P>
<P>
   An acidic romp through the underworld of New York nightlife in
the early '90s, St. James' chronicle repels and fascinates. A
fellow traveler in the New York club scene with uber-club kid
Michael Alig, St. James relates the tales surrounding the grisly
murder of alleged drug dealer Angel Melendez, a crime that sent
Alig and another clubland denizen to prison. No one in the story is
particularly likable, but it has some of the same car-crash allure
of ``The Jerry Springer Show'' at its trashiest. It's also a
frightening example of how inured much of our society has become to
murder.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The David Story: A Translation With Commentary of 1 and 2
Samuel by Robert Alter (Norton, $30).
</P>
<P>
   A splendid new translation of one of the Bible's greatest
stories. Alter, whose masterful translation of Genesis was
much-lauded, brings the tale of Israel's first king to life in this
clear and meticulously annotated volume. He manages to retain the
musicality and poetic beauty of the King James version while
incorporating his own ideas about translating ancient Hebrew and
the prodigious amount of biblical scholarship that has transpired
in the centuries since that landmark volume.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Learning the Ropes: An Apprentice on the Last of the
Windjammers by Eric Newby (Times Books, $35).
</P>
<P>
   Prolific adventure writer Newby signed on to the Moshulu, a
square-rigged, four-masted ship, as an apprentice in 1938. Less
than a decade later, none of these ships would remain, having been
sunk in World War II or scrapped. He took a camera with him, and
those photographs are mementos of a lost tradition. Even without
Newby's gripping tale, these photographs have a narrative drive of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  QUICK HITS: It's hard to believe that ``Patti Smith: An
Unauthorized Biography'' by Victor Bockris and Roberta Bayley
(Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25) is the first full-length life story of the
poetess of punk. More than any figure in pop music in the past 25
years, Smith has lived a life worthy of the biographical treatment.
... Michele Weldon spent 12 years in an abusive relationship and
she reflects on it in ``I Closed My Eyes: Revelations of a Battered
Woman'' (Hazelden, $15 paperback). This potent and painfully honest
chronicle describes an experience to which, sadly, many women will
relate.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Remembering Muscle Beach: Where Hard Bodies Began :
Photographs and Memories'' (Angel City, $26.95), Harold Zinkin and
Bonnie Hearn take us back to a time before steroids and the
hyper-inflated, cartoonlike proportions of body builders. Zinkin
was among the muscle boys on the Santa Monica, Calif., beach in the
1930s and '40s, and his enthusiastic reminiscences and the terrific
collection of photographs are as refreshing and fun as a romp in
the surf. ... Boston University professor of history and
international relations David Fromkin sheds light on the American
involvement in the Balkans with ``Kosovo Crossing: American Ideals
Meet Reality on the Balkan Battlefields'' (Free Press, $21). The
author of the authoritative ``A Peace to End All Peace: Creating
the Modern Middle East, 1914-1922,'' Fromkin argues that, to a
great extent, both sides in the conflict are still dealing with the
repercussions of that era's policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World of Words: An Illustrated History of Western
Languages'' by Victor Stevenson (Sterling, $29.95) gives a lively,
colorfully illustrated tour of our evolving modes of verbal
communication. ... Brooke Kroeger, journalism professor and former
reporter and editor for United Press International, examines the
life of an often overlooked author and activist in ``Fannie: The
Talent for Success of Writer Fannie Hurst'' (Times Books, $30). A
best-selling author in the 1920s and '30s, Hurst's work was made
into movies by Hollywood 31 times. She used her clout to further
admirable causes such as advancement for women and civil rights for
African-Americans. She was a friend and literary advocate of Zora
Neale Hurston and Dorothy West, and a frequent White House guest of
Eleanor Roosevelt.

 &HT;    Outsider Brooks follows his muse
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since he's never played the big-studio games, writer-director
Albert Brooks didn't lose sleep wondering whether his Hollywood
satire ``The Muse'' would ruffle feathers in the film industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you, the one advantage of not being a darling here
is that I don't care,'' he says by telephone from Los Angeles. When
a friend warned him that mocking the status quo could lead to a
fall from grace, ``My answer was, I've never been to grace. I don't
feel like I have anything to lose. I was born and raised here, but
I always felt like an outsider _ which, by the way, if you want to
be creative is a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brooks as a once-hot screenwriter, ``The Muse'' is all
about the creative impulse _ and the lengths some people will go to
to get a little inspiration. In this case, it comes in the costly
form of a woman (Sharon Stone) who claims to be a daughter of Zeus,
and one of the actual, mythical Muses responsible for artistic
invention.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks knew the movie would need a ``name'' actress to have
commercial appeal, and Stone was on the short list of possibilities
_ even though she's built her career on edgy dramatic roles.
``There's two exciting things you can do in a movie like this,'' he
says. ``You can cast a brand-new person that no one's ever seen, or
you can take an established person and show them in a new light.
That was the case here. And she's good at it. She knows how to poke
fun at herself and be light, and yet her roles have been very heavy
and dramatic over the years. She was a comedienne waiting to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   From his first feature through his last, Brooks has fostered a
satiric style that hasn't broken any box office records, but that
has earned him some loyal fans, including the fellow filmmakers who
have cameos in ``The Muse'' playing themselves: Rob Reiner, Martin
Scorsese and James Cameron. But just because other directors like
his work doesn't make it any easier for Brooks to get funding for
it. ``In this day and age, you can sooner get a lot of money for a
teenage sex comedy or a horror movie than you can for something I
do,'' Brooks says.
</P>
<P>
   Today's successful screen comedies rely not on the irony and sly
wit Brooks specializes in, but on the slapstick crudities you get
from the Farrelly brothers or Adam Sandler. ``You know what, God
bless Adam,'' Brooks says. ``He does what he does, and Lord knows
he's certainly successful at it. I don't happen to do that style of
comedy, but it doesn't mean I'm snobbish about it or anything.
Listen, whatever makes you laugh is fine.''
</P>
<P>
   He compares it to a car factory: If there were only one car
manufacturer, and it cranked out nothing but lemons, no one would
know to ask for something better. ``You've got to show people
something else, something better, and then they'll start to expect
it. But Hollywood is not in that business. Hollywood is all about
finding what currently works, and giving audiences more of that
until they can't take it any more.''
</P>
<P>
   He uses the ``The Blair Witch Project'' phenomenon as an
example: ``You can bet right now, every studio is saying, `Maybe
all we need to do is get a hand-held camera and send three of our
people into the woods.'''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks probably wishes those three were some of the Hollywood
executives he mocks in ``The Muse.'' And that they'd never come
back from the woods.

WHILE GOING THROUGH THE TRASH YOU LEFT AT MY HOUSE ...
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some people these days have become absolutely paranoid about
giving out personal information. They can go ballistic, for
example, if a bank or some similar business asks for a Social
Security number.
</P>
<P>
   Their identifiers, they fear, might be put to illegal or at
least irritating uses. Perhaps, for example, someone could forge
their credit cards or tap into their bank accounts. At the very
least, they could wind up on some telemarketer's or junk mailer's
list.
</P>
<P>
   Although such wariness can be carried to extremes, it does pay
to err on the side of excess caution in that regard rather than not
enough.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is the man who dumped his garbage bags on my
curb the other day. You heard me right: This guy in a pickup just
drives up and offloads two plastic bags of refuse on the curb next
to mine.
</P>
<P>
   No big deal, you say. That's what I said. But then I _ make that
we _ began to think about what he had done. And then my lawn work
supervisor and irrigation specialist became a little worried about
it.
</P>
<P>
   At first the wife and I didn't see what he actually did. We were
otherwise preoccupied with a dispute over the finer points of
edging. By the time we realized that the man had stopped and done
something in the vicinity of our garbage, he had driven away
without acknowledging our collective existence.
</P>
<P>
   We assumed that the guy was just another of the junk scavengers
who drive through the neighborhood and rummage through refuse for
metals and other salvageable items.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the edging had progressed to the other side of
the driveway that the lawn-cutting supervisor perceived that we had
more garbage bags at the curb than we had put there.
</P>
<P>
   ``No big deal,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he could have asked,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he didn't think we'd mind,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he missed the garbage truck at his house,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   I thought we were going to leave it at that. But then she asked:
</P>
<P>
   ``Why us?''
</P>
<P>
   And I knew where she was going. Not very many people who look
like us live on our street. And he saw us in the yard. After the
obscene graffiti visited upon us a couple of times and the cap with
the Confederate battle flag that was hung in one of our trees ...
well, I knew where she was going.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, don't go there,'' I said. ``You can't read a racist motive
into every idiotic action of some inconsiderate fool.''
</P>
<P>
   Then I turned paranoid and posed the possibility to the lawn
supervisor that the man might have been disposing of some kind of
criminal evidence _ human body parts, even.
</P>
<P>
   I said that half in jest. But the more I thought about it, the
more paranoid I got. I had to see inside those garbage bags. With
trembling fingers, I untied the first of them. It was ripe with
discarded food scraps. I was not about to rummage through that.
</P>
<P>
   The second bag, however, was mostly paper _ junk mail, discarded
bills and other documents from banks, credit card companies, his
church, etc.
</P>
<P>
   We learned his name, his address, his wife's name and just about
anything that any crook, private detective or government
investigator would need to know to take advantage of him or to
start a file on him.
</P>
<P>
   He had just dumped all of that personal information at the
curbside of strangers. It was hard to believe that anyone these
days could so carelessly toss around stuff like that.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the supervisor called the man, who, we discovered lived
four blocks to the north and two blocks to the west of us.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't think we'd mind, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he could have asked, she said. And she promised that if he
did it again, she just might call the police and get him cited for
illegal dumping.
</P>
<P>
   He laughed. But it was not the laughter of someone who was
amused. It had a worried edge.
</P>
<P>
   The supervisor asked me if we should report him anyway because
of his rudeness. I advised against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your warning was sufficient,'' I said. ``But if he does it
again, I can find a slew of mailing lists to put him on. Real
trashy ones.''

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, Steve Murray and Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Africa's
</P>
<P>
   Elephant Kingdom'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary
</P>
<P>
   It has some eye-poppingly large pachyderms, but it isn't as
visually astounding as ``Everest.'' Still, this Imax film has its
share of lovely images, including time-lapse shots of the sun
setting on the dusty horizon and a massive storm whirling across
the plain. (SM) 40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``American Pie'' R (sexuality, sexual dialogue,
</P>
<P>
   profanity, drinking)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan and Chris Klein.
</P>
<P>
   It's a raunchy, throwaway, pre-adult, R-rated high school
sexcapade with dirty dialogue and more than one risque encounter
between students that's broadcast over the Internet. There's also
the grossest joke involving a beer you're likely ever to see on
film. Little in ``American Pie'' deserves honest laughs. (Bob
Longino) 1 hour, 35 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Better Than Chocolate'' Unrated, but contains nudity
</P>
<P>
   and sexual situations.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Wendy Crewson
</P>
<P>
   and Karyn Dwyer.
</P>
<P>
   A sunny but badly scattered gay romantic comedy. The Canadian
comedy follows the love lives of a group of lesbians connected to a
bookstore called Ten Percent. Full of subplots, it's hard to
actively dislike. But like a puppy, it's sloppy and hyper and badly
in need of discipline. (SM)1 hour, 43 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blair Witch Project'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Heather Donahue,
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams.
</P>
<P>
   It's a journey into the kind of terror that comes from trying to
glimpse something in the shadows just beyond the campfire. Three
students head into the woods to document an 18th-century witch
tale, then disappear. The movie wrings chills out of the slightest
effects _ odd twiglike contraptions hanging from trees, a pile of
stones, strange noises in the night _ but its power comes from
psychological intensity. (SM) 1 hour, 27 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Bowfinger'' PG-13 (sex-related material
</P>
<P>
   and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Steve Martin,
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Murphy and Heather Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Martin has come up with a beautiful premise for a movie.
Martin plays a hapless Hollywood producer with a stinky script and
a gem of a way to get it filmed with impossible-to-get megastar Kit
Ramsey (Eddie Murphy). ``Bowfinger's'' got a few good laughs but
not much more. Sadly, it never takes on Hollywood with the zing of
``Wag the Dog'' or ``The Player.''
</P>
<P>
   (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 37 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Brokedown Palace'' PG-13 (violent content, drug use,
</P>
<P>
   profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Claire Danes,
</P>
<P>
   Kate Beckinsale and Bill Pullman.
</P>
<P>
   A by-the-numbers prison drama. Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale
sweat it out in a Thai maximum-security pit after being duped into
dope smuggling. Unbearably high-minded, the movie doesn't even have
the B-movie juice of an old babes-behind-bars melodrama. (SM) 1
hour, 54 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Chill Factor'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cuba Gooding Jr.
</P>
<P>
   and Skeet Ulrich.
</P>
<P>
   Summer's last-gasp action movie. There's a newfound deadly
chemical substance that'll blow and snuff out millions if not kept
cold. And two bickering heroes (Skeet Ulrich and Cuba Gooding Jr.)
who must keep military hooligans away from that chemical by
stuffing it inside an ice cream truck and putting pedal to the
metal. Unfortunately, ``Chill Factor'' doesn't have enough gas to
outgun its own concept. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 40 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Blue Sea'' R (excessive gore, dismemberment)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Samuel L. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   There is precious little that is original about this movie. It
really doesn't matter, though. When the plot kicks in and the
killer shark starts prowling and munching, the film delivers all
the thrills, explosive action and sheer gore that audiences have
come to expect from the shark genre. (Hap Erstein, Cox News
Service) 1 hour, 45 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit Rock City'' R (brief nudity, sexuality, drug use,
</P>
<P>
   profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Edward Furlong
</P>
<P>
   and Sam Huntington.
</P>
<P>
   Kiss it off. This lame rip-off of Robert Zemeckis' ``I Wanna
Hold Your Hand'' chronicles the misadventures of four die-hard Kiss
fans as they try to crash their idols' concert. Set in 1978, the
film has a few amusing nostalgic touches, but mostly it's a sorry
collection of adolescent fantasies that look almost quaint compared
to what else is going on in teen movies this summer. (ERG) 1 hour,
30 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dinner Game'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   With subtitles
</P>
<P>
   Starring Thierry Lhermitte
</P>
<P>
   and Jacques Villeret.
</P>
<P>
   A feast of foolishness. A bunch of snotty Paris yuppies holds a
weekly dinner to see who can bring the biggest idiot as his guest.
Publisher Thierry Lhermitte thinks he's got a sure thing when he
meets Jacques Villeret, who builds scale-model monuments out of
matchsticks. But fate intervenes when Lhermitte throws out his back
and is forced to spend the evening with Villeret. (ERG) 1 hour, 22
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``A Dog of Flanders'' PG (mild violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jon Voight.
</P>
<P>
   Not a total dog but close. A Dutch touch is about all that
distinguishes this adaptation of a 19th-century children's book
about an orphan boy who befriends the titular canine and dreams of
one day becoming an artist. Filmed on location in Flanders, the
movie abounds with windmills and picturesque town squares. What it
lacks, alas, are interesting characters and a decent story line.
(ERG) 1 hour, 50 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Dudley Do-Right'' PG (mild comic action violence,
</P>
<P>
   profanity, innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brendan Fraser
</P>
<P>
   and Sarah Jessica Parker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dudley Do-Right'' is just plain wrongheaded. Based on one of
the weaker elements of Jay Ward's TV 'toon series ``The Bullwinkle
Show,'' this live-action takeoff has so much less to offer. Brendan
Fraser (``George of the Jungle'') plays Dudley and it's clear he'd
rather not be here. There's not one joke or one slapstick moment
that's funny. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 27 minutes (including a new
``Fractured Fairy Tales'' cartoon short). F+
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story Imax
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM) 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyes Wide Shut'' R (profanity, sexual content, nudity,
</P>
<P>
   drug-related material)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Cruise
</P>
<P>
   and Nicole Kidman.
</P>
<P>
   The late Stanley Kubrick's final film is a letdown _ an often
frustrating peephole view at jealousy and sexual obsession that
confronts a rich New York couple (Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman).
While it has its moments, its much-touted centerpiece orgy doesn't
work. What you get resembles Cirque du Soleil as performed by the
cast of ``Showgirls.'' (SM) 2 hours, 35 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Haunting'' PG-13 (intense horror sequences)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liam Neeson,
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Zeta-Jones and Lili Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Scary in all the worst ways. ``The Haunting'' is a Hollywood
debacle, an overpriced mess with only one scare in it. That scare
is of the old-fashioned ``boo'' variety. It has nothing to do with
the over-the-top computer effects that make this less a remake of
the 1963 classic than a theme park in search of a script. (SM) 1
hour, 53 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``In Too Deep'' R (profanity, sensuality, some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Omar Epps
</P>
<P>
   and LL Cool J.
</P>
<P>
   A decent undercover-cop thriller highlighted by some smart
performances. Omar Epps is quite good as the detective, but LL Cool
J is a revelation as the ruthless drug kingpin, a monster made all
the scarier by his seeming benevolent charm. (SM)1 hour, 50
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Inspector Gadget'' PG (wacky violence, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Broderick
</P>
<P>
   and Rupert Everett.
</P>
<P>
   The best gag is the first one in Disney's big-screen version of
TV's popular animated part-human, part-machine, mucho-gizmo lawman.
Matthew Broderick is perfectly cast as Gadget. Rupert Everett goes
over the top as bad man Sanford Solex. Kids will enjoy watching
them both. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 20 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iron Giant'' PG (mild violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Nice story for kids, nifty look for adults. In 1957, a giant
metal-eating robot crash-lands on Earth and is befriended by
9-year-old Hogarth. But the robot's trail of munched-on trucks and
grain silos attracts a super-paranoid government agent. The
interesting mix of voice talent in this animated film includes
Jennifer Aniston as Hogarth's mom and Harry Connick Jr. as a
beatnik with seductive Elvis eyes. (ERG) 1 hour, 24 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' PG-13 (profanity, some violence
</P>
<P>
   and sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Hugh Grant, James Caan
</P>
<P>
   and Jeanne Tripplehorn.
</P>
<P>
   An effete British auctioneer (Hugh Grant) experiences culture
clash when he finds himself married to the mob, literally. Call it
a sleeping-with-the-fish-out-of-water comedy. Grant's one-trick
performance as an elegant bumbler is treadworn. He's terrific at
it, yes. But it's time to show more range. (SM)1 hour, 45 minutes.
C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Muse'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Albert Brooks, Sharon Stone
</P>
<P>
   and Andie MacDowell.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Brooks wrote, directed and stars in this Hollywood fable
about a screenwriter who's ``lost his edge'' and is sent to an
honest-to-the-gods Muse (Sharon Stone) for inspiration. Stone is
delicious. She plays her Muse as a mix of material girl, expert
networker and distracted spoiled child. In other words, she's
modeled her after half of Hollywood. (ERG) 1 hour, 37 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Mystery Men'' PG-13 (comic action violence
</P>
<P>
   and crude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Stiller, Geoffrey Rush,
</P>
<P>
   Hank Azaria and Janeane Garofalo.
</P>
<P>
   It's a spoof! It's an adventure! No, it's an amiable mess. Ben
Stiller and Janeane Garofalo headline a ragamuffin team of
superhero wannabes. But the movie is mostly like its hapless heroes
_ kind of clumsy and good intentioned but with none of the knack it
takes to save the day, or itself. (SM)2 hours, 1 minute. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside Providence'' R (teen drug use, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   sexual references)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Shawn Hatosy
</P>
<P>
   and Alec Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   Just ignore the Miramax marketing campaign. This movie may be
written by the ``There's Something About Mary'' gang, but it's
bittersweet funny, not raucous comedy. It's a coming-of-age tale of
a '70s Rhode Island teen (Shawn Hatosy) that captures the shaggy,
druggy ``what-next'' feeling that followed in the uncertain years
after the Summer of Love had come and gone. (SM)1 hour, 42 minutes.
B
</P>
<P>
   ``Run Lola Run'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Franka Potente
</P>
<P>
   and Moritz Bleibtreu.
</P>
<P>
   A pyrotechnic celebration of style over substance, this
adrenalin-fueled German flick is the big-screen love child of every
video game and MTV quick-cut editing trick of the past 10 years.
Franka Potente plays the flame-haired woman who has 20 minutes to
run through Berlin in search of 100,000 marks, or lose her lover.
In German with English subtitles. (SM) 1 hour, 21 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Runaway Bride'' PG (profanity and sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julia Roberts
</P>
<P>
   and Richard Gere.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning, alas, doesn't strike twice in this reunion of
``Pretty Woman'' stars Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. However, the
film isn't a fiasco and it does well by its intended audience,
i.e., anyone who wants to see Roberts galloping on horseback in
full wedding regalia. She's a bride who's already choked at the
altar three times and is about to try again. He's a cynical
journalist who's betting she'll run. (ERG)1 hour, 56 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' PG-13 (intense thematic material
</P>
<P>
   and violent images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising, spine-tingling gem. Eight-year-old Cole (Haley
Joel Osment) can see ghosts, not the Casper variety but restless
phantoms with their skulls blown open. It's a fascinating, odd film
that speculates on what the relationship between the restless dead
and a liaison to the living world might be. Plus, this film has the
best, and loveliest, last-act twist of the year. (SM)1 hour, 47
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Tea With Mussolini'' PG
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joan Plowright, Maggie Smith and Cher.
</P>
<P>
   Known in 1930s Florence as ``the scorpioni,'' thanks to their
collective sting, a band of British and American expatriate women
become surrogate mothers of a young boy named Luca. Based on his
autobiography, director Franco Zeffirelli's film is an uneven but
enjoyable tale of a boy growing up in Black Shirt Italy, entrusted
to a handful of Auntie Mames. (SM) 1 hour, 58 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle'' PG-13 (violence, sexuality, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   teen drinking)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Helen Mirren, Katie Holmes, Barry Watson and Marisa
Coughlan.
</P>
<P>
   It barely makes a passing grade. Three high school kids take
their evil history teacher hostage in her home and then try to
figure out how to get out of the mess they've created. It ends up
being a wishy-washy remake of 1980's silly ``Nine to Five.'' As the
tied-up teach, Helen Mirren is pretty good. Her young co-stars,
however, fail to match her talent. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 35 minutes.
C-
</P>
<P>
   ``The 13th Warrior'' R (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Antonio Banderas.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes cheesy movies can be great fun. That's true of this
rip-roaring yarn about a medieval Arab poet (Antonio Banderas)
who's drafted by a roving gang of rowdy Vikings to help rescue a
Norse village from a mysterious enemy that comes from the mist,
kills everything in sight and leaves a trail of headless corpses.
This flick hits the ground running and never stops. (ERG)1 hour, 43
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Windmills of Your Mind'' is still on the soundtrack, but
lots of other gimmicks from the 1968 original have been excised.
That's good. This remake is a guilt-free summer diversion. Pierce
Brosnan is an appealing billionaire gentleman rogue, stealing
priceless paintings. But it's really Rene Russo's film. As the solo
investigator hot on his trail, she prowls the screen savoring a
smart, sexed-up character. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``trick''R (sexuality, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and mature themes)Starring Christian Campbell
</P>
<P>
   and John Paul Pitoc.
</P>
<P>
   In this sturdy and well-acted gay romantic comedy, two guys
spend a night looking to make love in all the wrong places. Gabriel
(Christian Campbell) and Mark (John Paul Pitoc) pick each other up,
both clearly intending a mutually gratifying one-night stand. But
as the evening wears on, they're still on the street. The obstacles
become more contrived as the movie goes on. But, overall, ``trick''
is a minor treat. (ERG) 1 hour, 30 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Universal Soldier: The Return'' R (violence, profanity,
nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, Michael Jai White and Bill
Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   It's loud, it's brutal and, unfortunately, not packed with
enough fun. This is a return to Jean-Claude Van Damme's 1992
``Universal Soldier,'' in which dead military guys are turned into
chiseled, nearly unstoppable, cyborglike warriors. This time he's
got to battle wrestling's Bill Goldberg and a monstrously buffed
Michael Jai White. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 22 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolves'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Not as visually stunning as some Imax films, this is a highly
instructive look at the once nearly vanquished gray wolf's gradual
reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park and other parts of the
American West. Covers a bit too much ground, historically and
geographically; the best parts show wolves ranging from adult pack
leaders to newborn cubs exploring and adjusting to the wild again.
(Jill Vejnoska) 41 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wood'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Omar Epps,
</P>
<P>
   Taye Diggs and Richard T. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Friendship is what sets this movie apart from the usual genre
pigeonholing of African-American cliches and becomes something much
more universal. It's a male-bonding flick that transcends issues of
race. (SM) 1 hour, 46 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Xiu Xiu:
</P>
<P>
   The Sent-Down Girl'' R (strong sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Lu Lu Lopsang.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Chen demonstrates a real director's touch in eliciting rich
performances in this tale of a Chinese girl relocated to the
Tibetan outback. Chen gets maximum effect from the gorgeous but
indifferent landscape of her locations. The story's emotional
bleakness will limit its appeal, but it's a rigorous piece of work.
Beautifully shot and acted but brutal in its view of human nature,
it's an art-house, feel-bad film. (SM)1 hour, 39 minutes. B

 &HT;    The hue and cry of skin color vs. race is redefined
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 5.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you take your coffee with two teaspoons of cream, you know
something about Eugene Robinson. Whatever color you'd call your
coffee, you know Gene Robinson is black.
</P>
<P>
   Color has shadings, but race knows only black and white, yellow,
red and brown. And mostly black and white. African-Americans
understand this better than whites, who set up the crude taxonomy
of race in the first place. Robinson descends from a family that
ranges, as he says, from coal to cream, and within it he can
identify the ``rich cocoa brown'' of his sister, the ``milk
chocolate'' of his mother, the ``maple tones'' of his father's skin
and the ``oakwood brown'' of his own.
</P>
<P>
   But in the United States and most places, these shades are still
black any way you cut it, and so Robinson, a reporter for The
Washington Post, sought refuge in a tour of duty that would take
him to Brazil. He had tired of the racial straitjacketing in the
United States. If a racial rainbow existed anywhere, it was Brazil.
Colonized by the Portuguese, populated from the start by
copper-skinned Native Americans, darkened by generations of slaves
from Africa, Brazil knew color more than it knew race, and was
happier for it.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's rainbow landscape
</P>
<P>
   He could see it at once. A friend invited him to a party on the
beach in Ipanema, and he no longer saw the world in black and
white. ``All around us,'' he writes in ``Coal to Cream,'' ``was the
wonderful Brazilian racial landscape, a melange of blacks and
browns and and tans and taupes, of coppers and cinnamons and at
least a dozen shades of beige.''
</P>
<P>
   In such a kaleidoscope, who was really black and who was white?
Did it even matter? ``Here,'' after all, ``was a place where a kind
of benign racial anarchy seemed to rule, a lubricious, frictionless
chaos into which one could simply disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning to a woman whose predominant features clearly were
African, he asked what it was like being black in a place like
this?
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not,'' the woman answered, surprised at the question.
``I'm not black.''
</P>
<P>
   If she was surprised, he was even more so.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you must be,'' he said. ``I'm black, and you're as dark as
I am.''
</P>
<P>
   They did the arm test, and hers was darker by a couple of
shades.
</P>
<P>
   ```But this color isn't black,' the woman says. `This isn't
black at all.'''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson had gone to Brazil to escape race, only to find a
reversal of what he had known in the United States. One drop
colored you black where he'd come from. Here, a drop of cream and
you could call yourself anything you wanted. Whatever it might be,
you weren't ``black.''
</P>
<P>
   An integrationist come full circle
</P>
<P>
   This was only the beginning of his disillusionment: ``I had
looked at a milieu that Brazilians thought raceless and I had seen
race _ black people at the bottom of society's barrel.'' For all
the commingling of colors, each shading seamlessly into another,
race defined one as an individual in Brazil, too, and it largely
determined a social stratification that was easy to overlook.
</P>
<P>
   Put in this way, it seems an unoriginal observation, even to
someone who's never set foot in South America. But Robinson's real
point is a larger one than racial relations in Brazil. It took a
disillusionment with what he found there for him to acknowledge
that color will always be one thing and race another:
</P>
<P>
   ``When we speak of race in America, we speak in the terminology
of color _ we say black and white and yellow and brown _ but we
don't really mean color at all, not the way they mean color in
Brazil. What we really mean is racial identification, in the sense
of group identification. We mean people who share a history, who
share a culture, who share a status in society, who even by and
large share a political point of view. ... We associate the word
`black' with speech patterns, taste in clothing, sense of humor,
attributes that would seem to have little to do with skin color. We
see race as something absolute and immutable, and we recognize no
in-between.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to read into this resignation, even implied
separatism. To the contrary, ``Coal to Cream'' is the story of an
integrationist come full circle _ but an integrationist who no
longer denied what he was. He had sought refuge in what he thought
must be a racial rainbow, only to find he was as black as he ever
was. And that was OK, even if not everyone else on the beach in
Ipanema was as willing to acknowledge that the coffee can be good
with or without the cream.

   COKE-LAWSUIT _ ATLANTA _ The federal judge in the Coca-Cola
racial discrimination lawsuit declined to dramatically change his
order protecting the company's documents, but expressed concern at
the volume of files being stamped ``confidential.'' Plaintiffs'
lawyers had complained that Coca-Cola was abusing U.S. District
Judge Richard Story's order governing what documents can be made
public. The attorneys said Coca-Cola so far has indiscriminately
marked as confidential virtually all of the 32,000 pages of
documents the company has turned over to the plaintiffs. (Rankin,

 &HT;    Flattering jackets graze knee, calf
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 5
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   Jackets are long on style these days.
</P>
<P>
   Lengths extend past the knee or down to the ankle, providing a
more dramatic and refined feminine look than the traditional
blazer.
</P>
<P>
   Designers are pairing long jackets with sheath dresses, slender
skirts and narrow pants for styles that transition easily from work
to evening and special occasions. When worn with a matching dress,
the jacket can even replace the basic suit for a job interview.
</P>
<P>
   The jazziest of jackets come with hidden buttons and zippers,
panels that extend the length of the back, and simple details that
don't distract from the suit.
</P>
<P>
   But the best thing about the new look is the fit.
</P>
<P>
   Slightly tailored at the waist and softly unstructured at the
hip, the jacket offers a long straight line that most women can
wear. It can hide a wide bottom as easily as it can accentuate a
petite frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty flattering to most body shapes. It's a very
forgiving look,'' says Anita Finkelstein, fashion market editor for
Women's Wear Daily.
</P>
<P>
   Although it looks a lot like a coat, don't treat it like one.
This lightweight jacket should be worn as part of an outfit and
kept on all day.
</P>
<P>
   But don't mistake its versatility as a permanent replacement for
a standard jacket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just a new option to a blazer,'' says Susan
Forehand, fashion director at Saks Fifth Avenue. ``It's a wonderful
piece to have in your wardrobe to add excitement.''

 &HT;    Baroque in Brazil
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 5.
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OURO PRETO, Brazil _ Most travelers arrive home loaded with
throwaway phrases and tiresome photographs. Rarely do they tell you
what really happened. For instance, a person returning from the
legendary Vila Rica de Ouro Preto _ or ``Rich City of Black Gold,''
as it was named in 1711, after gold was discovered nearby _ is
liable to say something like: ``The architecture was amazing. And
the food _ you haven't lived!''
</P>
<P>
   But of course.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this city, just 271 miles northwest of Rio de
Janeiro, is known for its ostentatious array of 18th-century
Baroque art. For years, tourists and poets have rhapsodized about
Ouro Preto's 13 storybook white churches with gold-frosted
interiors, while students of gastronomy have prattled on about the
state of Minas Gerais' obscenely rich, African-inflected cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   New ways to eat okra, collards, corn and pork? Don't think I
won't go there.
</P>
<P>
   But before you hear about the wizened produce ladies and their
poignant bundles of cabbages ... the green soapstone faces posing
as fountains ... or how I foiled a pickpocket with my
lightning-bolt reflexes ... yes, before all that, I'm going to tell
you how I almost didn't get here at all.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding that this was to be an important stop on my two-week
journey to this South American nation, I penciled it in after Rio,
bought a ticket to Belo Horizonte, the closest major city, and
asked my Brazilian friends to book me a room. I figured it would be
easy to hop a bus for the final leg of the trip. After all, I speak
a little Spanish, which is similar to Portuguese, and I have landed
in far more exotic destinations with far less planning. No sweat.
This would be an adventure.
</P>
<P>
   So naturally, I was somewhat befuddled not to find my luggage
when I got off the jet. ``Wait,'' I said, gesturing to a Varig
Brazilian Airlines employee, ``you can't let the plane leave! My
luggage is still on it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, senhor, this is Goiania. Belo Horizonte is the next
stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh. Talk about a circuitous route:
</P>
<P>
   Going to Goiania to get to Belo Horizonte is kind of like going
to Chattanooga to get to Savannah. I guess the Varig staff was so
busy making sure I paid the airport tax that it forgot to mention
the stopover. And it didn't help that Portuguese plays by its own
rules. For example, bom dia (``good morning'') is pronounced
``bohn-GEE-uh.'' Rio, as in ``de Janeiro,'' is pronounced
``HEE-oh.'' Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   When I finally got to Belo Horizonte (``BAY-loh hori-ZONTCH''),
I was afraid to get off the plane _ literally. My luggage? It
wasn't there. This time, I was so tardy that it had been stashed in
a Varig office. And wouldn't you know, the bus station was another
40 minutes away. I was as out of my depth as the Beverly
Hillbillies trying to drive to Los Angeles _ but while they had
already struck black gold, I was far from it.
</P>
<P>
   After a high-speed taxi ride so that I wouldn't miss the day's
last bus, after a two-hour bus crawl through the mountains to Ouro
Preto, where I had to catch another cab to my hotel, after numerous
other delays and annoyances that I won't bore you with, I finally
arrived at my destination, Hotel Mirante.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that I began to understand Elizabeth Bishop's
cryptic line to Marianne Moore. No wonder Bishop ended up buying a
house here. It was probably easier than getting back home. But that
was just 46 years ago; I was about to step back three centuries in
time.
</P>
<P>
   A sensual dreamscape
</P>
<P>
   From any vantage point, Ouro Preto is a net of jewels.
</P>
<P>
   In the smoky first light of morning, looking down from the
surrounding hills, it is a blanket of red tile roofs shot through
with splotches of white _ church towers glowing with the creamy
patina of rose-colored quartz. By noon, the structures have
sharpened into cross-spangled castles of pure crystalline white,
with niches for bells and clocks _ and towers that remind you of
onion domes, spinning tops or skybound rockets. This 18th-century
Portuguese Baroque style has a vaguely Russian aura, but here in
the tropics, the buildings are fringed with leafy curtains of
banana trees and palms, hibiscus and roses, morning glories and
jasmine.
</P>
<P>
   Move closer in, and you see houses of pink, purple and blue;
sea-foam green, mustard yellow and shoe-leather brown. A pickup
sits in the town square, sagging under the weight of a load of
oranges. Water spurts from the grotesque faces of ancient soapstone
fountains. Flower and herb vendors _ the same old women pictured in
one of my guidebooks _ have set up shop right on the street,
surrounded by buckets of zinnias and daisies, crates of lettuces
and radishes.
</P>
<P>
   Early one Sunday morning, I wandered into the truck farmers'
market on Barra square to smell the perfume of limes, oranges,
watermelons, baby tangerines and bananas, miniature apples, grapes,
ginger, garlic, chives, onions, shallots, okra, green beans,
cucumbers, peppers, gourds, pumpkins, melons, potatoes, prunes,
raisins, eggplants, green tomatoes, coconuts, pears, papaya, stalks
of sugar cane and carrots as big as a man's forearm.
</P>
<P>
   I saw a perfect still life: trays of immaculate white eggs
stacked behind a bank of yucca roots, which had been cut open to
reveal their milky interiors. Everywhere, I saw baskets of beans _
black, red, speckled _ to be scooped up, bottles of cachaca (sugar
cane liquor) to be bought and drunk, faces to look at _ and faces
of farmers looking back happily, in the way that Brazilians do.
</P>
<P>
   Though I chose to hoof it up and down the formidable hills,
another option is to hire an English-speaking guide who can give a
brief history of the town. Gold was discovered in the state of
Minas Gerais (General Mines) in 1694. Shortly afterward, there were
encampments known as Ouro Preto, Ouro Podre (Rotten Gold) and Ouro
Fino (Fine Gold). Today the gold is gone, but the churches _ and
the history _ remain. In 1980, the city was designated a historic
world treasure by UNESCO, the cultural arm of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant historic figures are Tiradentes, who mounted a
revolt against the Portuguese crown and went on to become a
national hero after he was hanged in 1792, and the artist Antonio
Francisco Lisboa (1738-1814). The Michelangelo of Brazil, his
genius was to integrate the overwrought ornamentation of European
Baroque with the earthiness of the common man _ miners, slaves and
natives. Because he suffered a degenerative disease of the hands
and feet, he was known as Aleijadinho (``the little cripple'').
</P>
<P>
   The sanctum sanctorum of his craft is the Church of Sao
Francisco de Assis, begun in 1776 and wreathed, inside and out,
with cherubs. It is a landmark, known as much for the cheesy
soapstone craft market in front _ miles of aisles of vases and
bookends, lidded jars and bric-a-brac _ as for its artistic riches,
its balconied ivory interiors tooled in gold leaf.
</P>
<P>
   This church is everyone's first stop. Afterward, you may orbit
the village, stopping to shop, eat, nap or look at more churches at
your leisure. Just to the west of the church, in a shop where
tourists dress up in period costumes to have their pictures taken,
I met a set of rosy-cheeked young men from the local university,
dressed in top hats, ruffled shirts, bow ties and fancy jackets.
They were about to sit for a portrait with their begowned and
bejeweled mother.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the dizzying interiors _ dusted with gold dust and just
plain dust _ one of the best is Our Lady of Pilar (1711). I loved
the way its little tinkly chandeliers are suspended from golden
brackets jutting from the walls like birds.

   OURO PRETO, Brazil _ from the walls like birds.
</P>
<P>
   I loved the keyhole-design second-story window, streaming with
the magnificent brightness of morning. Underneath it was a
starburst gilt mirror surrounded by four angels. Amid all this
loveliness, on a wide-brimmed balcony overlooking the church, I
stood to admire the chapel. It was chockablock with gold, in the
way that Ouro Preto's churches are.
</P>
<P>
   You could spend days wandering in and out of churches and shops
by day, ducking into cozy little bistros by night. On a Friday
night, I happened upon a capoeria demonstration tucked inside a
university room off the main square. To the syncopated thud of
congas, tambourines and berimbau, young martial arts students in
all-white outfits tumbled and kicked to the Afro-beat. Though the
art form is known for its tough, streetwise sensibility, these
gentle warriors waved no machetes.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, couples kissed in doorways, or waited in line at the
cinema to see ``Orfeu,'' the remake of ``Black Orpheus,'' with a
new soundtrack by Brazilian pop star Caetano Veloso. Later on, I
was lured into Spaghetti Pizzeria, on Rua Conde de Bobadela, by the
guitar-strumming Rubinho Santos, who was soon joined by a young
woman in a black beret and miniskirt. Together, they swayed through
his bossa nova songbook, and everyone in the subterranean shotgun
room sang along, in the way that Brazilians do.
</P>
<P>
   Down the same street, at O Profeta, I listened to Veloso
sound-alike Celso Alves, and enjoyed a bowl of caldo verde
(literally, ``green soup,'' a Minas specialty of pureed potatoes,
collards, garlic and bacon). At one point, I saw a tipsy girl on
the street mumbling the Beatles lyric, ``Help! I need somebody!''
</P>
<P>
   There was even a conference of Elizabeth Bishop scholars, who
sat in restaurants looking witless and bored, worrying about the
politics of publishing, announcing that the licor de jabuticaba (a
local cordial made of grapelike berries and offered in good health)
tasted like ``fermented prunes.'' Quite a contrast to the smiling
Brazilians who traded convivial thumbs-up signs with bumbling
tourists _ or the Tropia family, who welcomed me into their
apartment above Restaurante Chafariz when I stopped to buy a bottle
of their homemade jabuticaba liqueur.
</P>
<P>
   The only sour note to this sojourn was on the final morning. It
was sunrise, and I decided to take one last stroll to admire the
view. What was first just a lit cigarette on two legs became a man
with a backpack. He stopped to ask me directions and proceeded to
brush into me awkwardly. I sprang off him like a rubber band, and
headed up the street to my hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I was just paranoid to think he was a thief; perhaps he
had just arrived and was really lost. Certainly, I could relate.
</P>
<P>
   I shrugged it off and headed back to the hotel. I had a lovely
stash of stories to tell, new friends to meet and, since I'd
planned ahead, a private car to drive me to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE
</P>
<P>
   Though Oct. 12, Delta is offering a $1,181 round-trip fare to
Belo Horizonte, the closest major city to Ouro Preto (Delta:
1-800-241-4141). Make sure you book a flight to Belo Horizonte's
Pampulha airport, not Confins. From the airport, it's a short bus
ride to the city bus station, where you may purchase a ticket to
Belo Horizonte.
</P>
<P>
   Visa: To travel to Brazil, you must have a tourist visa. For an
application, contact the Consulate General of Brazil in Miami
(305-285-6200; www.brazilmiami.org). There is a $45 charge.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO STAY
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hotel Mirante. This immaculate, moderately priced hotel just
north of town has beautiful rooms with aquariumlike glass-encased
showers, stupendous views and a good breakfast. English is so-so.
377 Rua Pandia Calogeras, Barra neighborhood, near the
Sunday-morning market. 011-031-551-2773.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Solar Nossa Senhora do Rosario. This four-star hotel, in a
stunningly renovated 19th-century building near the Church of Our
Lady of Rosario, is probably the best in the city. But avoid the
restaurant at all costs, even if the hotel tries to include dinner
with your room rate. By Brazilian standards, the dining room is
very expensive, and my dinner was one of the worst I had in Brazil.
Hotel is highly recommended. 270 Rua Getulio Vargas.
011-031-551-5200.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO EAT
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Restaurante Chafariz. This all-you-can eat buffet has
superlative versions of all the regional specialties. Tutu a
Mineira, a rich puree of black beans, is always served with an
extravagant feast of various pork cuts, including sausage, pork
roast and fried cracklings. It is the local version of feijoada,
the national dish of pork and black beans, and this particular
rendition is excellent. Here, as everywhere, it is accompanied by
white rice and sauteed kale (couve). On the dessert table, check
out the preserved green-mango curls. 167 Rua Sao Jose.
011-031-551-2828.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Casa do Ouvidor. In a lovely, second-story room overlooking
one of the main streets, you can try all the Minas standards. The
frango com quiabo (chicken with okra) was particularly good. For
dessert, get the amendoim con coco (coconut-peanut mush) with a
glass of jabuticaba liqueur. 42 Rua Direita. 011-031-551-2141.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO SHOP
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Casa da Arte Popular. This consortium of artists' studios is
one of the prettiest spaces I saw in Ouro Preto, with brightly
colored handmade work for sale. Owner Sergio Tropia is friendly and
full of helpful advice for tourists. 165 Rua Sao Jose.
011-031-551-1011.

 &HT;    Cultural riches in Rockwell country
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 5.
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKBRIDGE, Mass. _ In his famous song ``Alice's Restaurant,''
Arlo Guthrie immortalized a hole-in-the-wall restaurant in
Stockbridge, Mass. But the refrain applies to all the Berkshires.
You can get anything you want here, from avant-garde art museums to
antique silver, all in the idyllic surroundings of small, manicured
New England towns set like gems in a ring of verdant hills.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its back-in-time appearance, this section of western
Massachusetts is quite sophisticated, thanks to its proximity to
Boston and New York City. Both before and after Norman Rockwell _
one of the most famous residents _ artists and writers considered
it the perfect retreat, as have the wealthy city folk who built
palatial ``cottages'' in which to spend their summers and weekends.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, it is rich in cultural offerings. Autumnal beauty
makes September and October the busiest months in the Berkshires.
Tourists fill the many inns and bed-and-breakfasts to take in the
fall color, shop, hike and hang out.
</P>
<P>
   Each town has its own character and specialty. Lenox, one of the
larger villages, is the place to do some serious shopping and
dining. Williamstown, home of Williams College, is the epitome of a
college town. You can go from place to place with ease using U.S. 7
as the spine, and, because it's a small area and well-marked, it's
nearly impossible to get lost.
</P>
<P>
   This is definitely Rockwell country. The Manhattan native fled
New Rochelle, N.Y. (too suburban), for this remnant of old-time
America, where you can still walk down Main Street, and where even
the post office has enough pride to set flowers out front. The
virtues Rockwell extolled and the Colonial stock he depicted live
on in these ruddy faces and simple-seeming places.
</P>
<P>
   The beloved illustrator spent 15 years in Arlington, Vt., about
30 minutes north of the Massachusetts border in the Green
Mountains, and the last 25 of his life in Stockbridge. Both have
museums honoring their favorite son, and every native seems to know
a spot or a person from one Saturday Evening Post cover or another.
Indeed, a visit to western Massachusetts and southern Vermont can
become a Rockwell pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Norman Rockwell Museum. Built in 1993 as a take on a
traditional town meeting hall, Robert A.M. Stern's columned design
is intimately scaled inside in keeping with the homespun vision of
the subject. The tiny Stockbridge museum includes galleries devoted
to the permanent collection of paintings made for magazine covers,
posters and memorabilia as well as exhibitions on other
illustrators. Docents doubling as guards offer anecdote-filled
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss the studio, which was moved from Rockwell's
Stockbridge back yard to this glorious 36-acre site along the
Housatonic River. The studio is set up as close as possible to the
way Rockwell left it. The easel stands in the middle, with a
bouquet of carefully cleaned brushes and paint tubes at the ready.
The space also contains his well-stocked library, reproductions of
artwork that interested him (including Picasso!), props and
souvenirs from various travels. For more information: 413-298-4100
or online at www
</P>
<P>
   .nrm.org.
</P>
<P>
   One of the paintings in the gallery, ``Main Street in
Stockbridge,'' is a partial map for the next step of your tour. You
can return to town and check out the bank where ``The Marriage
License'' is set, dine at the Stockbridge Inn _ a favorite
breakfast spot for Rockwell, who lived around the corner _ or peer
into the storefront where he had his first studio. Down the street
is the cemetery where he is buried under a modest headstone.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Arlington Gallery. When Rockwell lived in West Arlington, Vt.,
he was an energetic part of the community. As he did in
Stockbridge, he used many townspeople as models in his work. The
Arlington Gallery fills a former church with contemporary photos of
Rockwell's models juxtaposed with reproductions of the works in
which they appeared. Marge Brush, one of the docent-models who
works here, recounts her experience posing in her doctor's office
with her family for the 1947 ``Country Doctor,'' which hangs by the
front door. She'll autograph a card or poster, too.
</P>
<P>
   There's not an original in sight, but this place is a lot of fun
and long on human interest. It offers a lively 15-minute video to
the accompaniment of Arlo Guthrie music and lots of tidbits about
Rockwell and his work. A state-by-state recounting shows two pieces
set in Georgia: a Coca-Cola ad and a 1946 portrait of Mrs. Effie
McGuire teaching in a country school in Carroll County.
802-375-6423.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Rockwell, other points of interest to round out your
visit include:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Chesterwood. Chester French, sculptor of the Abraham Lincoln
Memorial in Washington, lived and worked on this Stockbridge
estate, whose gardens and woodland walks he also designed. His
studio is fascinating, not only because it is filled with plaster
casts and molds, but also because it reveals how the studio
functioned as a living space. The artist relaxed, entertained and
did business in an anteroom stuffed with furniture. A wide veranda
frames pristine views in the back, and the grounds double as a
contemporary sculpture garden. 413-298-3579.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Naumkeag. Joseph Choate, a prominent New York lawyer and
ambassador to the Court of St. James's, built this Stockbridge
house in 1886 as a retreat for his family. Designed by the famed
Stanford White, the 26-room, turreted-shingle-style manse perches
on Prospect Hill, affording wonderful views of the countryside,
which included Choates' working farm. A wonderful example of Gilded
Age taste, the home is surrounded by delightful gardens.

   &QR;  Edith Wharton Home. The author actively participated in the
design of this Lenox lakeside villa in 1902. 413-637-1899,

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hancock Shaker Village. From 1790 to 1960, the religious
community built and occupied this village in Pittsfield, Mass. The
20 restored buildings and demonstrations of cooking, farming,
carpentry and such illuminate a humble way of life that produced a
widely admired sense of design. The famous circular Round Stone
Barn, designed for maximum efficiency, is an architectural
must-see. The red-brick Dwelling, where the Shakers lived,
demonstrates the elevation of simple functionality to the realm of
art. 1-800-817-1137, www.hancockshakervillage.org.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sterling and Francine Clark Institute. The Clarks collected
all sorts of things, from antique silver to Flemish altarpieces,
but the heart of their collection is the 19th century. The
Pittsfield museum is rich in both traditional and avant-garde
expressions of the period. Female nudes predominate, from the
smooth-skinned women in academic Bougereau's canvases to the fleshy
beauties of Renoir. The Clark Institute also hosts a program of
temporary exhibitions. 413-458-9545, www.clark.williams.edu.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Williams College Museum of Art. Robert Venturi designed the
classical entrance and an addition that connects seamlessly to the
beaux arts original of this fine college museum in Williamstown. It
rotates its permanent collection and also offers a stimulating
selection of temporary exhibitions. 413-597-2429.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to Village Beautiful, as Williamstown is called, should
include a walk around the 206-year-old Williams College campus, the
epitome of an ivy-covered New England college.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  MASS MoCA. This contemporary art center (the full name is the
Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art) in North Adams, Mass.,
was once a complex of factory buildings. The striking renovation
retains the gritty character while providing space for monumentally
scaled art that has trouble finding a home elsewhere. With its
acres of art _ even if it isn't your cup of tea _ MASS MoCA is
worth a visit just for the setting. 413-664-4481, www.massmoca.org.

   COKE-LAWSUIT _ ATLANTA _ The federal judge in the Coca-Cola
racial discrimination lawsuit declined to dramatically change his
order protecting the company's documents, but expressed concern at
the volume of files being stamped ``confidential.'' Plaintiffs'
lawyers had complained that Coca-Cola was abusing U.S. District
Judge Richard Story's order governing what documents can be made
public. The attorneys said Coca-Cola so far has indiscriminately
marked as confidential virtually all of the 32,000 pages of
documents the company has turned over to the plaintiffs. (Rankin,

A HOT SUMMER FOR HIT FILMS; ALESSANDRO NIVOLA HEATING UP; HAMPTON
FRANCHER FINDS DIRECTION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ The summer movie season is just about finished and
there are a lot of happy, happy faces in black Armani suits sitting
around the patios at Spago Beverly Hills and the Ivy. For once, for
some reason, almost everything has been clicking for filmmakers
here.
</P>
<P>
   Before the summer started the betting money was that the
juggernaut of ``Star Wars: Episode I'' would dominate the season so
thoroughly that the film might squelch all but a handful of
competitors, save perhaps ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged
Me,'' ``Wild Wild West'' or one of the Julia Roberts comedies.
</P>
<P>
   Instead it has become a season for the record books, with
box-office grosses up 20 percent over last summer's record take.
When the season ends on Monday night, the summer's box-office take
could well hit $3 billion. It was done not through the dominance of
a few big films, as is often the case, but by a steady parade of
hits that just kept on, in almost every genre from almost every
studio appealing to almost every age.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the biggest summer of all time,'' said Paul
Dergarabedian, chairman of Exhibitor Relations, a company in Los
Angeles that monitors film-release schedules and box-office
performance. ``To have this kind of summer, you really need to have
movies with across-the-board appeal, to all age groups and to all
parts of the country. And that's what we've had.''
</P>
<P>
   Missing, he said, was ``a preponderance of action films, another
`Armageddon' or `Lethal Weapon' or `Die Hard.''' Instead, the
record has been built _ beyond the $425 million made by ``Star
Wars,'' with characters like Darth Maul (above) _ on an unusually
large number of mid-range, character-driven genre films, not all of
them, for a change, pitched at young audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise turned out to be the back-to-back,
late-summer successes of ``The Blair Witch Project,'' the tiny
independent horror film that became a phenomenon for young
audiences, and ``The Sixth Sense,'' a psychological horror film
that surprised almost everyone, including its studio, Disney, by
becoming the breakout hit of August. If the Exhibitor Relations
projections are correct, ``Sixth Sense'' could eventually reach
about $210 million at the box office, edging it ahead of the $205
million projected for the ``Austin Powers'' sequel as the summer's
second most popular film.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other big hits were the animated ``Tarzan'' (an
estimated $170 million), the Adam Sandler comedy ``Big Daddy''
($160 million), the special-effects-filled remake of ``The Mummy''
($155 million) and the re-teaming of Julia Roberts and Richard Gere
in ``Runaway Bride'' ($145 million).
</P>
<P>
   An astonishing 11 films released this summer have already
grossed more than $100 million each _ a benchmark never before
reached by somany films in one summer _ and a 12th film, ``American
Pie,'' is less than $3 million away from that mark and almost
certain to cross over it. A 13th film, ``Inspector Gadget,'' is
still in theaters; with more than $87 million already in the bank,
it has an outside chance of going over the top, too.
</P>
<P>
   There were nine weekends in a row between mid-June and early
August when there was a different No. 1 film every weekend,
something that hasn't happened in at least 10 years. ``We're still
going back and checking all the records, but I don't believe it's
ever happened before,'' Dergarabedian said.
</P>
<P>
   How did this happen?
</P>
<P>
   He has a theory. ``There was a momentum created at the beginning
of the summer by `Star Wars' and it got everyone into the
theaters,'' he said. ``And they saw all the trailers and they were
exposed to all this movie marketing and it created a strong sense
among moviegoers that there was a lot to see and they just kept on
going. At the beginning of the summer, people were afraid that
`Star Wars' would absorb all the interest, but all it seemed to do
was whet everyone's appetite for more.''
</P>
<P>
   SUDDEN EXPOSU &UR; RE FOR ALESSANDRO NIVOLA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   There are these strange confluences in the lives of actors when
they suddenly seem to be appearing in all sorts of films at once.
Even though the movies were often made months or years apart, the
vagaries of release schedules put them before audiences one after
the other and an actor who might have otherwise had just one swing
at the plate is given two or even three chances to catch the
audience's attention.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Alessandro Nivola finds himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very strange because I've been working steadily these
past couple of years and nobody's seen any of it, and now it's all
starting to come out at once,'' he said. ``It's strange, but it's
also good, because now the audience and the people in the industry
will get a chance to see me in three very different roles, one
after another. Maybe the three together will make more of an
impression than just one of them alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Nivola, 26, pecked away at his ``full fry'' breakfast at Hugo's
on Santa Monica Boulevard one morning this week, swirling around
the chunks of poached egg and gesturing with a bit of potato
impaled on a fork.
</P>
<P>
   Nivola has probably made his biggest impression as Pollux Troy,
Nicolas Cage's psycho-genius younger brother in John Woo's
``Face/Off.'' He will have major roles in at least two and possibly
three films between now and the end of the year, beginning with the
lead role opposite Reese Witherspoon in ``Best Laid Plans,'' set
for release on Sept. 10, a modern noir from the director Michael
Barker full of plot twists and betrayals and dark emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Then he will play Henry opposite Embeth Davidtz in ``Mansfield
Park,'' the Jane Austen novel adapted by the director Patricia
Rozema, which is scheduled for release on Nov. 5. He plays the king
in Kenneth Branagh's semimusical adaptation of ``Love's Labour's
Lost,'' in which the Shakespeare play is interspersed with Cole
Porter and Irving Berlin songs. The film is scheduled to open in
the spring of 2000, but Nivola said that the actors have been told
that there may be a limited release late this year to qualify for
the Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Nivola, a Yale-trained actor, spent three years in regional
theater before his Broadway debut opposite Helen Mirren in ``A
Month in the Country,'' which led to the role in the action film
``Face/Off.'' He moved to Los Angeles from New York to make the
film for Woo, but has hardly been in California since then, making
three out of five subsequent films in England. He said he got one
job _ Michael Winterbottom's ``I Want You'' in 1998 _ and it led to
a second and third. He did not plan to be an American actor in
England.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I did do was turn down a bunch of jobs right after
`Face/Off' that were, you know, kind of big sci-fi things or movies
where people wanted to cast me as a villain,'' Nivola said. ``I was
afraid that if I did that, I would be stuck in that forever. So
since then I've been on a progression toward much more romantic and
brighter characters.''
</P>
<P>
   The last bit of English muffin disappeared. ``I find gratuitous
violence sort of hard to stomach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HAMPTON FANCHER FINDS DIRECTION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Hampton Fancher has wanted to direct a film since he was 22. He
finally got the chance, at age 61. Fancher has had a long career as
a television actor (appearing in episodes of ``Gunsmoke,'' ``Perry
Mason'' and other programs of the 1950s and early 60s),
choreographer, film actor (``Parrish,'' ``The Other Side of the
Mountain''), fiction writer, acting coach, screenwriter (``Blade
Runner,'' ``The Mighty Quinn'') and producer (``Blade Runner'').
But he had never gotten one of his own film projects off the ground
_ until ``The Minus Man'' came along.
</P>
<P>
   The project started several years ago when he found the book of
the same title and a partner and wrote the screenplay in five
months. He waited two years while money was being raised, put
together a truly amazing, ``how did these people get in the same
room together'' cast (Owen Wilson, Brian Cox, Janeane Garofalo,
Sheryl Crow, Dwight Yoakum, Mercedes Ruehl), shot the film and
finished cutting in January. This week he took a breather from the
festival circuit and roamed the offices of the film's production
company, the Shooting Gallery, in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was drawn to the story because it is about the proximity of
good to evil,'' Fancher (above) said. ``We long for darkness. We
are attracted to what can destroy us.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is about a young, attractive and affable psychopath (
Wilson) who wanders into a town and kills people, a modern-day
Shane as serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the duality of his character that was so interesting,''
Fancher said. ``The juxtaposition of the light and the dark. There
are some moviegoers, some people who want to know exactly what is
in front of them. I would rather swim through voluptuous water in
the darkness.''
</P>
<P>
   What took so long for the chance to direct a movie?
</P>
<P>
   He shrugged. ``I've been in preproduction before twice, but the
money fell out,'' he said. ``Perhaps some people aren't interested
in the same things I am.''

 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Democrats mounting a major challenge to topple
the Republicans as the majority party in the House, lawmakers on
both sides have been hearing this message from their leaders:
``Hold onto your seats!''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the party that wins the most open seats, those
vacated by incumbents, could win control of the chamber next year.
</P>
<P>
   And the message is getting through. Members appear to be
hunkering down and holding on at a time when the razor-thin
five-vote margin in the House is the narrowest it has been in 45
years.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans now hold 222 House seats, compared with 211 for
Democrats and one independent, Bernard Sanders of Vermont, who
often sides with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Open seats are viewed as wild cards, especially if the vacancies
are in closely divided districts where it's tough to predict how
voters will respond to new candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Republican and Democratic leaders are edgy because they know
that the party of a retiring House member has retained control of
the seat that's up for grabs 74 percent of the time since World War
II. That's a big drop from 94 percent of the time when an incumbent
runs for reelection.
</P>
<P>
   So strategists in both parties are begging, cajoling and
arm-twisting to persuade their members to stay put. They may
promise committee chairmanships, pledge to help candidates raise
campaign dollars or try to discourage members from running for
higher office if their chances of success are slim.
</P>
<P>
   John Feehery, spokesman for House Speaker Dennis J. Hastert,
says flatly, ``The Republican leadership doesn't want GOP members
to retire. You don't want to defend a lot of open seats.''
</P>
<P>
   Feehery says his party's leaders are touting the strong showing
of Republican presidential frontrunner George W. Bush, telling
colleagues there is a good chance of pairing a GOP Congress with a
GOP president.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are also pushing to keep their incumbents firmly
planted at their posts.
</P>
<P>
   John Del Cecato, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee, says a big incentive for House Democrats to
remain in office is the hope that they can regain control, which
they lost in 1994. ``It's absolutely in sight,'' he insists.
``We're on the doorstep of retaking the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Heading the Democrats' House effort is Rep. Patrick Kennedy,
D-R.I., who decided to forego a run for the Senate so he could take
the job.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that the hang-in-there warning has been heeded is the
fact that so far in the 106th Congress just 13 Republican and six
Democratic seats are open because of members retiring or seeking
higher office. The death of Rep. George Brown, D-Calif., earlier
this year left his seat empty.
</P>
<P>
   While there is still more than a year to go before elections,
these 19 vacancies fall well short of the 33 open seats last year
and the 53 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But among the 19, several are in swing districts, and experts
are predicting nail-biter fights for the seats. They include those
of Republican Reps. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Jack Metcalf of
Washington, who are honoring term-limits pledges, and Rick Hill of
Montana, who is leaving because of complications from eye surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking higher office from other competitive districts are Reps.
Bill McCollum, R-Fla., Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., and Ron Klink,
D-Pa., who hope to ascend to the Senate, and Reps. Dave McIntosh,
R-Ind., and Robert E. Wise, D-W.Va., who want to move into their
state governor's mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic House members trying to hold onto their seats yearn
for majority-party status so that their side can dictate the
legislative agenda in the chamber and control such details as when
members leave for recess and how many serve on a committee.
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans, the specter of losing all that power is
horrifying. ``It's like being on a superbowl team and then being
traded to an expansion team,'' says Amy Walter, an analyst at the
Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Jacobson, a political scientist at the University of
California at San Diego, predicts pressure from both parties on
members to stay will make the coming election a ``low retirement''
one.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson notes that the House has a lot of new blood _ members
who were elected since 1992, making the period an era with the
highest turnover of House seats in more than 50 years. ``There are
a lot of people who aren't ready to retire yet,'' Jacobson says.
</P>
<P>
   He also points to the fact that House members tend to try to
hold their seats through the end of a decade, after which
congressional districts are redrawn to conform to new Census
counts. Then, two years later, after district lines have been
redrawn and reelection prospects are more uncertain, the number of
retirees jumps markedly.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1990, 27 House members retired, compared with 65
retirements in 1992, he says.
</P>
<P>
   If Republicans lose the House next year, many of them will bolt,
predicts Paul Herrnson, professor of government and politics at the
University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who were in the majority don't like the indignities
associated with being in the minority,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Even those in the majority may join the exodus if they fail to
win chairmanships. ``If you are passed over for a chairmanship,
then your power amounts to peanuts,'' Herrnson explains.

   And the message is getting through. Members appear to be
hunkering down and holding on at a time when the razor-thin
five-vote margin in the House is the narrowest it has been in 45
years.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans now hold 222 House seats, compared with 211 for
Democrats and one independent, Bernard Sanders of Vermont, who
often sides with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Open seats are viewed as wild cards, especially if the vacancies
are in closely divided districts where it's tough to predict how
voters will respond to new candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Republican and Democratic leaders are edgy because they know
that the party of a retiring House member has retained control of
the seat that's up for grabs 74 percent of the time since World War
II. That's a big drop from 94 percent of the time when an incumbent
runs for reelection.
</P>
<P>
   So strategists in both parties are begging, cajoling and
arm-twisting to persuade their members to stay put. They may
promise committee chairmanships, pledge to help candidates raise
campaign dollars or try to discourage members from running for
higher office if their chances of success are slim.
</P>
<P>
   John Feehery, spokesman for House Speaker Dennis J. Hastert,
says flatly, ``The Republican leadership doesn't want GOP members
to retire. You don't want to defend a lot of open seats.''
</P>
<P>
   Feehery says his party's leaders are touting the strong showing
of Republican presidential frontrunner George W. Bush, telling
colleagues there is a good chance of pairing a GOP Congress with a
GOP president.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are also pushing to keep their incumbents firmly
planted at their posts.
</P>
<P>
   John Del Cecato, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee, says a big incentive for House Democrats to
remain in office is the hope that they can regain control, which
they lost in 1994. ``It's absolutely in sight,'' he insists.
``We're on the doorstep of retaking the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Heading the Democrats' House effort is Rep. Patrick Kennedy,
D-R.I., who decided to forego a run for the Senate so he could take
the job.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that the hang-in-there warning has been heeded is the
fact that so far in the 106th Congress just 13 Republican and six
Democratic seats are open because of members retiring or seeking
higher office. The death of Rep. George Brown, D-Calif., earlier
this year left his seat empty.
</P>
<P>
   While there is still more than a year to go before elections,
these 19 vacancies fall well short of the 33 open seats last year
and the 53 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But among the 19, several are in swing districts, and experts
are predicting nail-biter fights for the seats. They include those
of Republican Reps. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Jack Metcalf of
Washington, who are honoring term-limits pledges, and Rick Hill of
Montana, who is leaving because of complications from eye surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking higher office from other competitive districts are Reps.
Bill McCollum, R-Fla., Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., and Ron Klink,
D-Pa., who hope to ascend to the Senate, and Reps. Dave McIntosh,
R-Ind., and Robert E. Wise, D-W.Va., who want to move into their
state governor's mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic House members trying to hold onto their seats yearn
for majority-party status so that their side can dictate the
legislative agenda in the chamber and control such details as when
members leave for recess and how many serve on a committee.
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans, the specter of losing all that power is
horrifying. ``It's like being on a superbowl team and then being
traded to an expansion team,'' says Amy Walter, an analyst at the
Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Jacobson, a political scientist at the University of
California at San Diego, predicts pressure from both parties on
members to stay will make the coming election a ``low retirement''
one.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson notes that the House has a lot of new blood _ members
who were elected since 1992, making the period an era with the
highest turnover of House seats in more than 50 years. ``There are
a lot of people who aren't ready to retire yet,'' Jacobson says.
</P>
<P>
   He also points to the fact that House members tend to try to
hold their seats through the end of a decade, after which
congressional districts are redrawn to conform to new Census
counts. Then, two years later, after district lines have been
redrawn and reelection prospects are more uncertain, the number of
retirees jumps markedly.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1990, 27 House members retired, compared with 65
retirements in 1992, he says.
</P>
<P>
   If Republicans lose the House next year, many of them will bolt,
predicts Paul Herrnson, professor of government and politics at the
University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who were in the majority don't like the indignities
associated with being in the minority,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Even those in the majority may join the exodus if they fail to
win chairmanships. ``If you are passed over for a chairmanship,
then your power amounts to peanuts,'' Herrnson explains.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: SUMMER COMEDIES TEETERING ON THE EDGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Albert Brooks, playing a successful middle-aged
screenwriter in ``The Muse,'' is bluntly informed by a baby-faced
executive reptile at Paramount Pictures that his writing has lost
its ``edge,'' it is the career equivalent of a death sentence. Only
magic of a particularly glitzy and silly Hollywood sort can help
him regain it.
</P>
<P>
   Edge. Oh to have it! To be on the cutting edge, to be, as they
say, edgy! If you're pitching a movie or a television show to a
Hollywood baby mogul nowadays, it had better have edge, or you're
history, kiddo. But what is that exactly? After running neck and
neck with the sweet old-fogyish ``hip'' to evoke what's
progressive, contemporary and (excuse the cliche) ahead of the
curve, edge seems to have pulled ahead. It has, as they say, the
edge.
</P>
<P>
   And what about hip? Does hip have a future? Perhaps not, at
least in contemporary Hollywood, unless the project is steeped in
1960s and '70s nostalgia. One of the funniest of this summer's
unexpectedly delicious crop of movie comedies, the Watergate satire
``Dick,'' exemplifies classic hip comedy of the ``Saturday Night
Live'' school, circa 1976. That may be one reason why ``Dick''
bombed at the box office. Where hip carries connotations that
suggest a heart and an ethical value system beneath a facade of
cool (the movie ridicules Richard Nixon and his White House crew as
hypocritical baddies), edge is so hip it doesn't need a heart. All
it needs is an edge.
</P>
<P>
   Where hip implies a suspicion of wealth and power as the
ultimate goals in life (and a tolerance bordering on fondness for
recreational drugs), edge is about winning, scoring, cashing in and
getting there first. It's being under 30 and on the inside of an
IPO. It's being head of production for a major movie studio at 29.
It's pulling off a brilliant stunt like the summer's biggest box
office and marketing phenomenon, that no-budget pseudo-student
documentary ``The Blair Witch Project.'' Or coming up with the
whopping (and whoppingly sentimental) must-see surprise ending in
the summer's other unexpected blockbuster, ``The Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it's putting one over on the Motion Picture Association
of America by convincing the ratings board that the deliriously
potty-mouthed animated film ``South Park: Bigger, Longer and
Uncut'' deserves an R, rather than an NC-17 rating.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Brooks with pointing out the latent cruelty of the word
``edge'' in his new comedy. Underneath its deceptively sunny
surface ``The Muse'' is so bitter that its mockery of Hollywood
lingo could conceivably spell the beginning of the end of edge as a
power-lunch cliche.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, who wrote and directed the movie, is Steven Phillips, a
screenwriter whose career heads down the toilet once that baby
reptile cancels his three-picture deal and kicks him off the lot.
Desperate to regain his status, Steven is forced to spend a fortune
hiring Hollywood's hottest muse, Sarah (Sharon Stone), an extremely
charming, spoiled, high-living beauty who claims to be the daughter
of Zeus and struts around Los Angeles in filmy powder-blue gowns
waving a fan. During Sarah's travels, several of her top clients,
including Rob Reiner, Martin Scorsese and James Cameron, do amusing
walk-ons.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stone is hilarious as the fickle, self-centered, whorish
embodiment of the Hollywood dream, an inspiration-for-hire psychic
friend who ``knows everybody'' and can only be had for a very high
price. Sarah is so pampered and finicky that she won't begin
working her magic for Steven until he installs her in a
$1,700-a-night suite at the Four Seasons Hotel. As he discovers to
his embarrassment, gifts from Tiffany's (not $50 key rings but
$3,500 bracelets) are de rigueur offerings to the muse to keep her
interested.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, she moves into Steven's house, appropriating the
marriage bed he shares with his cookie-baking wife (Andie
MacDowell), whom she coerces into becoming a professional baker,
even hooking her up with that redoubtable superstar chef Wolfgang
Puck.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah eventually revives Steven's career with a ridiculous
high-concept notion for a Jim Carrey comedy about a man who
inherits an aquarium full of sick fish. Presented with this piffle,
Steven's agent naturally goes bananas with excitement. And so does
every other Hollywood producer who reads the script. So much for
seriousness, taste and judgment in contemporary Hollywood, Brooks'
movie sneers. Having edge really means coming up with the
equivalent of the next ``Ace Ventura.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Butting heads at the box office with Brooks' comedy is Steve
Martin's equally funny but more soft-toothed Hollywood satire,
``Bowfinger.'' Directed by Frank Oz and starring Martin, who wrote
the screenplay, ``Bowfinger,'' like ``The Muse,'' is essentially a
likable one-joke comedy aimed at Hollywood and stretched almost to
the breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   Martin plays Bobby Bowfinger, a sleazy self-deluding Tinseltown
hustler with no taste and no shame. Bobby is obsessed with making a
ludicrous sci-fi movie called ``Chubby Rain'' starring the
extremely paranoid Hollywood superstar Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy).
The plot has something to do with aliens who secretly invade the
earth concealed in raindrops.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to make the movie even without Kit's cooperation,
Bobby and his film crew follow Kit around Los Angeles, hiding in
the shrubbery, dispatching cast members to cross paths with the
star, then surreptitiously filming these encounters. Bobby
eventually completes the movie without Kit's becoming aware that he
has been filmed. Only one final touch is missing. Kit never utters
the screenplay's crowning punch line: ``Gotcha, suckers!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bowfinger'' also has its own resident guru in the person of
Terence Stamp playing a cult leader for a Scientology-like
organization called Mind Head to which Kit belongs. The concept of
edge doesn't figure in the film. But at the end when ``Chubby
Rain'' has its Hollywood premiere to an appreciative audience, it's
clear that this inept, amateurish garbage is deemed to have the
same edge as Brooks' aquarium farce.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that both ``The Muse'' and ``Bowfinger'' satirize
Hollywood suggests the genuine anxiety and fear felt by filmmakers
of a certain age when confronting Hollywood's youth culture and the
booming teen-age market.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, in his sarcastic, self-lacerating way, and Martin in his
genially wacky one, are both gambling that a young American
audience weaned on Hollywood gossip and trade information will be
titillated by an insider's comic view of their company town and its
nutty values.
</P>
<P>
   For all their thematic similarities, the two movies are unlike
in crucial ways. ``The Muse,'' like Brooks' other films, maintains
a style of heightened comic realism that places the star, his
neuroses and anxieties front and center. Brooks' Steven is a
tightwad, a worrywart and a whiner with an oversized (but easily
deflatable ego). He is barely likable.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Brooks may hate being thought of as the Left Coast
Woody Allen, he has compiled a powerful body of work by embodying
the same sort of urban Jewish neurotic who wears his hang-ups on
his sleeve. By making his stand-ins so abrasive, Brooks is nastier
to his screen alter egos than Allen is to his. ``The Muse'' could
be seen as Brooks' answer to Allen's even more dyspeptic
``Celebrity,'' though Brooks' movie seems more acutely in tune with
the nuances of the culture he is savaging.
</P>
<P>
   Allen and Brooks really don't seem to know how to end many of
their comedies. After taking us inside the head of an alter ego,
they often don't know how to get out again. Having invented the
fabulous Sarah, Brooks is at a loss as to how to explain her, and
in the movie's only major blunder he invents a prosaic earthly
resume for her. He needn't have bothered.
</P>
<P>
   Where Brooks' comedy is essentially introspective and heavily
dosed with Freud, Martin's humor doesn't aspire to that kind of
psychological realism. Melding ``Saturday Night Live'' sketch
comedy with observational humor in the tradition of '70s Blake
Edwards and Paul Mazursky movies, Martin adds a third element, a
whimsical literary humor descended from S.J. Perelman.
</P>
<P>
   For all its contemporary touches, Martin's Tinseltown is as much
Hollywood past as it is contemporary. Daisy (Heather Graham), the
ingenuous Hollywood hopeful picked to star in ``Chubby Rain''
moments after arriving on a bus from the heartland, exudes a 1940s
freshness that is amusingly at odds with her matter-of-fact
bartering of sex for a juicier role. By having her span decades,
Martin sees her as an enduring Hollywood archetype.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, who plays two roles in the movie (both brilliantly),
embodies the same double vision. While the jumpy, hypersensitivity
of his paranoid movie star with bodyguards and entourage seems
completely of the moment, his other role as a dumb, grinning, Kit
look-alike who graduates from gofer to unwitting stunt double on
the project is a timeless comic goofball from another, more
innocent era.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Martin may look down on the industry mentality that
spends millions creating movies that are only marginally less silly
than ``Chubby Rain,'' in ''Bowfinger'' you also sense him standing
back and observing the madness with an avuncular grin. He has been
around the block long enough to be able to let go. Brooks, by
contrast, takes the absurdity of Hollywood personally. Beneath the
laughs, you can feel the pain and desperation.
</P>
<P>
   How much edge do these movies have? Not too much, at least by
Hollywood's ruthless commercial standards. ``The Muse'' fared
disappointingly at the box office on its opening weekend, doing
about half the business per screen that Martin's film had done a
few weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Neither movie begins to compare with the successes of this
summer's comedy blockbusters, Adam Sandler's ``Big Daddy'' and the
teen-age grossout movie ``American Pie,'' an upscale ``Porky's.''
The success of ``American Pie'' and the failure of the much funnier
and more sophisticated ``Dick'' sharply illustrates the generation
gap that also hurt ``Bowfinger'' and ``The Muse.'' While audiences
over 35 found the loss-of-virginity contest in ``American Pie''
puerile, audiences under 35 were mystified by ``Dick,'' a political
comedy set in the dark ages of the early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Even having the teen-age stars Kirsten Dunst and Michelle
Williams appear in ``Dick'' didn't help much. Consider the fact
that today's 17-year-olds were born in 1982, fully a decade after
the Watergate break-in. To this generation, Watergate is as much
ancient history as the Depression was to the baby boom audience
that lapped up ``Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar fate befell ``Election,'' a very grown-up and
disturbing satire of the American success ethic revolving around a
student election in a Nebraska high school. The presence of
teen-age actors couldn't sell a film that many critics have deemed
an American classic but that Paramount Pictures couldn't figure out
how to market.
</P>
<P>
   The other significant comedy trend of the summer was the
ascendance of romantic comedy or rather romantic comedy starring
Julia Roberts, whose two hits, ``Notting Hill'' and ``Runaway
Bride,'' each grossed more than $100 million. Hugh Grant, Ms.
Roberts' winsome co-star in ``Notting Hill,'' also demonstrated
modest box office clout later on as the star of the flighty Mafia
comedy ``Mickey Blue Eyes,'' in which he plays a dapper art
auctioneer about to marry into the mob.
</P>
<P>
   In surveying the summer comedy sweepstakes, let us not forget
the one and only ``South Park,'' arguably the year's funniest
comedy and the best movie musical in years. With more smutty,
tittering humor and flatulence than you might find in a half-dozen
Jim Carrey or Adam Sandler movies, ``South Park'' certainly has
edge. With risque songs that parody everything from Rodgers and
Hammerstein to Alan Menken and a portrait of Satan as the sex slave
of Saddam Hussein, ``South Park'' is the first mainstream animated
movie that might be described as an anti-Disney musical in its
humor, which deliberately went up against nervous, politically
correct sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   With its fearless embrace of black, Jewish and gay stereotypes
and its ridicule of adults as hypocritical, hysterical warmongers,
``South Park'' managed to be hip as well as edgy. But although it
fared well at the box office, earning about $50 million, it didn't
do a third of the business of the Disney blockbuster ``Tarzan.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial lesson of ``South Park'' could be that after all
is said and done, there might be such a thing as too much edge.

CALIFORNIA DREAMING
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Thursday, Aug. 9)  
(mk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The longing may have lessened since our last rumbling of the San
Andreas Fault, but my Michigan friend seems to believe that if she
lived in California her life would be better.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I think she has a pretty fine life, including a husband and
daughter who make her laugh and a cat. She can walk from her house
to restaurants and book stores and she has generous friends who
have a cabin on the lake. She can get on the train and go to
Chicago when she's bored. There are fireflies in the summer and
snow in the winter. She can grow peonies.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe her corner market doesn't have our vast wine selection,
but I've been to her restaurants and they're fine about sauvignon
blanc and they know about olive oil and goat cheese.
</P>
<P>
   She and I both read a recent study on personal happiness that
looked at whether people are happier in California or the Midwest
and concluded that there is no real difference. But, there is an
imagined difference. People in California and the Midwest THINK
that people are happier in California.
</P>
<P>
   See, I told her. If she were here she'd have to be acting like
she was always thrilled, while back in Michigan she can get away
with grousing and no one thinks she's ungrateful.
</P>
<P>
   I tell her that I know lots of unsettled Californians, including
two, in fact, who just moved to New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The same research study noted that people who live in France and
Italy are less happy than those who live in Denmark, even though
much of the world thinks Italian and French people are delighted
with who and where they are. I guess we think the same of Danes,
but no one makes much of it.
</P>
<P>
   In Northern California we are so smitten with Italy and France
that we sometimes act like pretenders, referring to ourselves as
the Provence of California and going on about our Tuscan-like
hills. We don't often pretend to be Danish.
</P>
<P>
   Many think Californians are happy because we have wonderful
weather, which begs the question _ particularly on an August
morning when both the car heater and headlights are necessary _
what's so wonderful?
</P>
<P>
   The weather factor, often determined by the number of sunny
days, weighs heavily in those studies that rate the best places to
live. Weather is right up there with economy, crime rates and good
schools. Mayors and chambers of commerce get pumped up over these
ratings and the local newspaper is always obliged to print the
results if their city gets named, but I don't know anyone who has
ever been motivated by such lists to sell the house and take off in
a big yellow truck.
</P>
<P>
   They might if the studies included other qualities. Is there a
vet in town who makes house calls? Is the farmers market as popular
as the mall? Is there any place to go when the movie lets out?
</P>
<P>
   The Utne Reader once did a ranking of Most Enlightened Towns
that included how well they recycled. Arcata, Ca., Burlington, Vt.
and Madison, Wis., did well. The last two also showed up in a list
of top Latte Towns where people linger over coffee and prefer small
businesses to superstore chains.
</P>
<P>
   There used to be a list of the best art towns _ places to live
if you like to be around artists and go to poetry readings. The
price of real estate was an important measure because even slightly
successful creative types rely on funky places to work and live.
Several California towns showed up on that list, but the way real
estate is going here there's not much left for bohemians.
</P>
<P>
   I pointed that out to my Michigan friend, who happens to live in
a house with a full basement, attic and a sun porch which I covet
along with her warm nights. She said warm nights aren't all they're
cracked up to be.

TREASURIES FALL SHARPLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury securities fell sharply Thursday on
continuing worries that the Fed is not quite finished with its
current cycle of tightening.
</P>
<P>
   With economic reports showing no significant signs of weakening,
the 30-year bond fell 21/32 to a price of 100, or par, and its
yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.13 percent,
from 6.08 percent on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Traders' fears were stoked early in the session after Edward
Kelley, a Federal Reserve Board governor, said in an interview with
Market News Service that the Fed remained ``intensely vigilant,''
even though it has already raised the federal funds rate a half
percentage point since late June. That is the rate that banks
charge one another for overnight loans. Kelley said it would be
premature to assume that the Fed would wait until next year to
raise rates further.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Asset Management,
said that if the latest statistics released this week were any
guide, the Fed ``could soon tighten again despite the good deal of
recent market chatter to the contrary.''
</P>
<P>
   Data over the last few days have produced steadily rising bond
yields, and Kelley's comments Thursday reinforced that trend.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's labor market data will be crucial for both near-term
bond market behavior and the Fed's next policy decision on Oct. 5,
Fine noted.
</P>
<P>
   The forecast for unemployment rates seems to be split between
assuming no change at 4.3 percent and expecting a modest drop to
4.2 percent, while projections for average hourly earnings and
nonfarm payrolls are for increases of three-tenths of a percent and
215,000 new jobs added to the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The economy still has plenty of vigor, analysts say, but while
the inflation rate must still be characterized as subdued and
benign, it is no longer falling, ``and indeed appears to be slowly
rising,'' Fine said. ``While the extent of these movements is still
unknown,'' he added that the Fed's ``gumption'' is likely to be
tested over the near term.
</P>
<P>
   A report Thursday on manufacturers' orders provided further
evidence that the manufacturing sector is bouncing back, according
to Marilyn Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   Orders placed with manufacturers increased 2.1 percent in July,
after rising .8 percent in June. The increase was the largest gain
in durable goods orders in more than 18 months, while demand for
nondurables was almost flat.

CHRISTOPHER LEE RECALLS A LEGENDARY ACTING CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (bl) 
 By TERRY PACE   The TimesDaily (Florence, Ala.)   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRYSTAL CITY, Va. _ When Christopher Lee decided to become an
actor, the first person he told was his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her reaction was straight out of Victorian melodrama,''
recalled the 77-year-old master of movie menace. ``She reeled back
with one hand to her brow and the other one holding onto the door.
She said, `You can't! You can't! You can't! Think of the shame
you'll bring upon the family _ and think of the people you will
meet!' ''
</P>
<P>
   In a screen career spanning 52 years and more than 200 features,
the British actor has encountered unforgettable people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met most of the giants, and I worked with many of them,''
Lee said during a rare personal appearance at Monster Rally '99, a
worldwide gathering of horror and science-fiction fans this August
in Crystal City, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has been directed by Laurence Olivier, John Huston, Orson
Welles and Billy Wilder, as well as modern moviemakers Steven
Spielberg, Joe Dante, John Landis and, most recently, Tim Burton.
He's acted alongside stars ranging from Bette Davis and John
Gielgud to Peter Sellers and Johnny Depp.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some wonderful actors today, but there are no
giants,'' Lee said. ``People say to me, `What do you think of these
people, or those people?' I never have an answer for that. I like
to say, `They come, and they go' _ the golden boy, the golden girl,
the flavor of the month, making millions. How long will they last?
In this day and age, the way films are made and people are cast,
not long.''
</P>
<P>
   Monster Rally '99 marked the U.S. release of ``Tall, Dark and
Gruesome,'' a revised and updated edition of Lee's critically
acclaimed 1977 autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   With Lon Chaney Sr. and Jr., Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, Vincent
Price, Peter Cushing and John Carradine all dead and gone, Lee
remains the sole survivor of classic horror cinema's elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boris Karloff was a dear friend of mine, and for a time we
lived next door to one another in London,'' Lee said. ``It was said
that the bodies were collected daily.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee remains best-known for his portrayals of Bram Stoker's,
Dracula. Lee first assumed the role in Terence Fisher's 1958
shocker, Hammer Films' ``Horror of Dracula.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing that part was a tremendous launching pad for me,''
said Lee, who would reprise the Dracula character in six
increasingly inferior Hammer sequels. ``I wasn't a name, I wasn't a
face, although I'd been around 10 years. That was an important part
for me _ an enormously important part.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee's first ``Dracula'' also marked one of many teamings with
his friend Cushing, who played the vampire slayer Professor Van
Helsing. The actors first joined forces for Hammer's 1956 ``Curse
of Frankenstein,'' in which Cushing played the ruthless baron and
Lee portrayed his creation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met this quiet, reserved, extremely courteous, delightful
man,'' Lee said. ``My first reaction was, `This man is a real
actor. I can learn a lot from him.' He says I burst into his
dressing room _ looking like nothing on earth, literally _ shaking
the script and saying, `I haven't got any lines!' And he said,
`You're lucky. I've read it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Cushing, who died of cancer in 1994, and Lee teamed up in
chillers for the next three decades. In their last film together,
``House of the Long Shadows'' (1983), the British duo shared
shudders with Americans Price and Carradine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gradually over the years Peter and I developed a professional
partnership, and I came to love him _ dearly,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years after ``Horror of Dracula,'' Lee again donned black
cape, fangs and blood-red contact lenses to play the Transylvanian
vampire in Hammer's ``Dracula _ Prince of Darkness.''
</P>
<P>
   With each successive sequel, released between '66 and '73, Lee
grew progressively frustrated as screenwriters carried the
scenarios farther away from Stoker's 1897 novel. ``In that second
film, I did not say one word _ I flatly refused to, because I'd
read the script,'' Lee recalled. ``I said what I've always said:
`Why don't you use Stoker's words?' They never did, or hardly ever
did. There was no way I was going to burst into the room and shout,
`I am the apocalypse,' and things like that. Unbelievable. So I
never said a word.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``Dracula'' films and his partnership with
Cushing, Lee's favorites include ``The Devil's Bride'' (Hammer's
spine-tingling 1968 adaptation of Dennis Wheatley's occult novel,
``The Devil Rides Out'') and his role as Lord Summerisle, the ruler
of a secluded island of mysterious pagan worshipers, in the 1973
thriller ``The Wicker Man.''
</P>
<P>
   He enjoyed a long association with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's
detective, Sherlock Holmes. Lee played Holmes in a 1962 German film
and two 1990s made-for-TV movies. He portrayed the endangered Sir
Henry (opposite Cushing as Holmes) in Hammer's 1959 ``Hound of the
Baskervilles'' and also played Holmes' brother, Mycroft, in Billy
Wilder's ``The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes'' in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a beautiful picture,'' Lee said. ``Wilder was
everything you've heard _ a perfectionist. He said, `I spent two
years writing this, and you're going to get every word right.'
Believe me, we got it right. Thanks to Billy Wilder, my Mycroft was
infinitely better than my Holmes.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor's other mainstream credits include the James Bond
movie ``The Man With the Golden Gun'' (1974, with Lee as the
villainous assassin Scaramanga), the swashbucklers ``The Three
Musketeers'' (1974) and ``The Four Musketeers'' (1975), Disney's
fantasy ``Return from Witch Mountain'' (1978), Spielberg's comedy
``1941'' (1979), ``Serial'' (1980, with Lee as a gay biker) and
Dante's ``Gremlins 2: The New Batch'' (1990, with Lee as evil
scientist Dr. Catheter).
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Lee moved to the United States, and joined a cast _
headed by Jack Lemmon and James Stewart _ for a half-airborne,
half-underwater disaster thriller, ``Airport '77.'' Soon afterward,
Lee hosted NBC's hit late-night comedy series ``Saturday Night
Live!''
</P>
<P>
   ``My agent said, `You've been approached by the most popular
television show in the United States,' '' Lee said. ``I had never
heard of it. He said, `They want you to host. It's live
television.`' I said, `Oh no, I'm not doing live television.' ''
Lee relented, but with considerable misgivings.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived at the New York studio, he immediately joined a
script-reading session. The script featured sketches spoofing Lee's
popular associations with Dracula, Holmes and Bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat down, opened the scripts and started to read,'' Lee
said. ``They all stared at me _ not a smile _ and I thought it was
going to be a catastrophe. It turned out to be a joyful experience
....''
</P>
<P>
   Lee returned to England in 1985, and his film career has
remained busy, including an upcoming cameo in Tim Burton's spin on
Washington Irving's ``Sleepy Hollow,'' which will be released to
theaters in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim Burton is an actor's dream _ he directs with such
enthusiasm,'' Lee said. ``I only have a small scene _ two or three
minutes at the most. But my scene is with the star of the film,
Johnny Depp, who has renewed my faith in the star system. He is
such a good actor. I think he's as good as it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, the 6-foot, 4-inch actor, doesn't rule out another
screen outing in cape and fangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I would do it _ but only if it was Stoker,'' Lee said,
``what he wrote and what the character said. Not word for word, but
using his lines and his story, because it has never, ever been
done.''

BUDWEISER RECALLS 5.7 MILLION BOTTLES OF BEER IN EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By AL GOODMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ Anheuser-Busch Cos., the world's largest brewer,
said Thursday that it was recalling 5.7 million bottles of its
Budweiser and Bud brands from 12 European nations after consumers
complained that glass slivers had broken off the rim of some
bottles when the twist-off caps were removed.
</P>
<P>
   The brewer, based in St. Louis, said the recall covered less
than 1 percent of its beer sold annually in Europe. The move
involves all 25-centiliter and 33-centiliter twist-off bottles sold
in Spain, Belgium, Portugal, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, the
Netherlands, Switzerland, Latvia, Cyprus and Malta, and
25-centiliter bottles in France.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of the beer is not the problem, Anheuser-Busch said
in a statement. The company traced the defects to two glass
suppliers, one in Madrid and the other in Portugal, where faulty
manufacturing equipment caused the rims of some bottles to extend
slightly more than normal, making them susceptible to breaking off.
</P>
<P>
   Anheuser-Busch said that a small number of bottles filled in
Spain but sold in Britain had also been recalled. But the company
said that twist-off Budweiser bottles filled in Britain were not at
risk, nor were those sold in Italy, Ireland or Greece, which use
glass from a different source.
</P>
<P>
   A man from Ireland on vacation in the Canary Islands of Spain
complained to the company on Aug. 11 after apparently swallowing a
piece of glass, and nine more complaints have come in since Aug.
25, including reports from France of one person cutting a hand and
another cutting a lip, said William H. McNulty, vice president and
managing director for Europe for Anheuser-Busch European Trade Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working very diligently'' on the recall, McNulty said in
a phone interview from his Brussels office. ``Everyone understands
the importance of this.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 11 percent of the 5.7 million bottles were collected
on Wednesday, the first day of the recall, with special attention
to Spain, the most affected country, where 3.2 million bottles were
recalled, McNulty said.
</P>
<P>
   France and Belgium have the next highest number of bottles to be
collected. Budweiser is sold under the Anheuser-Busch B brand name
in Germany and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   He said Anheuser-Busch had been on a ``higher level of alert''
since the company received a single complaint in February about a
bottle problem at the Portuguese glass plant, called Barbosa
Almeda, followed by a complaint in May about the Madrid plant,
Vicasa.
</P>
<P>
   Anheuser-Busch has no ownership stake in nor management control
of the two glass companies, which supply bottles to a Spanish
company in Barcelona that brews the Anheuser-Busch brands for the
12 nations affected by the recall.
</P>
<P>
   Anheuser-Busch's statement said the manufacturing problem was
caused by ``uneven wear and tear on the bottle-forming mold
equipment,'' but McNulty said he did not know why both bottle
suppliers, in separate countries, would have similar
quality-control defects other than the possible use of their
equipment too long before replacing it.
</P>
<P>
   The two glass plants ``are working to help resolve the problem
by revising their production equipment that will assure the problem
will not recur,'' Anheuser-Busch said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second significant drink recall in Europe this
summer. Coca-Cola Co., the world's largest soft-drink maker,
withdrew millions of cans across Europe in June after hundreds of
people reported illnesses from drinking the company's products.
</P>
<P>
   Anheuser-Busch's revenues in Europe are less than 5 percent of
the parent company's total, McNulty said. The brewer exported beer
to Europe for decades before establishing a presence in 1984 in
Britain with a licensed brewery arrangement and has since expanded
across the Continent.

 &HT;    A&AMP;M will introduce calf cloned from adult bovine
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Ralph Fisher wanted a second chance for his
famous bull named Chance, and Texas A&AMP;M University gave him one: a
clone that will be mugged for the cameras Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Second Chance, a 24-day-old calf that was trotted out at an
Aggie news conference in College Station, is only the second bovine
to be cloned from an adult animal in the United States. There are
several others in the world, and they are being touted as a
potential boon for the cattle industry _ a quick way to reproduce
the traits in a prized animal that, left to nature, would take
years.
</P>
<P>
   Chance died last September, but not before Texas A&AMP;M researchers
took cells from his skin. They later injected one of the cells into
a cow egg and implanted it in a surrogate mother. She gave birth to
Second Chance Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's the oldest bull that's ever been cloned, and
it's the oldest male animal,'' said cloning project leader Mark
Westhusin, an associate professor of veterinary physiology and
pharmacology at Texas A&AMP;M. ``We're glad we got him.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of Connecticut got there first. In
June, they introduced Amy, a 94-pound Holstein, the first calf
cloned from an adult in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher doesn't care who was first. He is thrilled that his bull,
Chance, will live on in a clone that will be returned to him when
Texas A&AMP;M is finished studying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I care about my baby,'' said Fisher, who is 55 and put himself
through college as a rodeo clown. ``The hair stands up on the back
of my neck when I hold him and squeeze him. It's a miracle of
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the original, Second Chance is playful, and the researchers
want to see if he'll look the same and be as gentle as Chance.
They're also interested in how quickly he'll age.
</P>
<P>
   Chance was a 2,000 pound Brahman bull _ the kind with the hump
and hanging skin _ who traveled the rodeo and celebrity circuit and
was photographed with politicians, beauty queens and celebrities,
including former Houston Mayor Bob Lanier, Dan Rather, Connie
Chung, Willie Nelson and the late Sonny Bono. Chance appeared in
commercials and on the David Letterman show 10 years ago. Sandra
Fisher, Ralph's wife, said he also ``starred'' in a movie with Kate
Capshaw and Ashley Judd.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a big old, wonderful, fuzzy . . . tame breeding bull I
turned into a pet and a business partner for years,'' said Ralph
Fisher, who photographed Chance at all of the events. He has
similar plans for his Second Chance.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was Chance unusually gentle, he looked different than
today's Brahman cattle, which have been changed by selective
breeding, Fisher said. Chance had a larger head and hump, much
bigger horns and more skin hanging from his neck and belly. Those
traits have been diminished in modern Brahman cattle to reduce the
amount of waste when the animals are made into steaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's part of a dying bloodline,'' Fisher said, adding that
he's not trying to revive the breed. ``I'd just like to have him in
the same capacity as before, as a partner in the business,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, an alumnus of Sam Houston State University, said he took
Chance to Texas A&AMP;M for various surgeries over the years and grew
to trust the vets. Fisher told them that Chance would be a great
animal to clone, and Westhusen is leading a $2.3 million effort to
clone the first dog _ Missy, a mixed-breed border collie.
Researchers in Scotland have also cloned a sheep named Dolly from
an adult animal.
</P>
<P>
   When Chance died, Fisher cried, his wife said.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said he couldn't bear to bury Chance. ``I could have left
him in the pasture for the buzzards to get him or I could have
buried him with a front end loader, but . . . I just couldn't throw
him away.'' Fisher spent about eight hours removing Chance's skin,
and then took it to a taxidermist to mount and stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said he had no qualms about having Chance cloned. ``I
don't think it would be a good idea for the human species, but if
it's used in the right way with animals, they can eliminate
diseases we've had for years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In religious circles, most mainline denominations have taken a
stand against human cloning, but the lines are still fuzzy when it
comes to animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``How far do you go?'' said the Rev. John Leies, director of the
Center for Professional Ethics at St. Mary's University of San
Antonio.

 &HT;    A&AMP;M will introduce calf cloned from adult bovine
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Ralph Fisher wanted a second chance for his
famous bull named Chance, and Texas A&AMP;M University gave him one: a
clone that will be mugged for the cameras Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Second Chance, a 24-day-old calf that was trotted out at an
Aggie news conference in College Station, is only the second bovine
to be cloned from an adult animal in the United States. There are
several others in the world, and they are being touted as a
potential boon for the cattle industry _ a quick way to reproduce
the traits in a prized animal that, left to nature, would take
years.
</P>
<P>
   Chance died last September, but not before Texas A&AMP;M researchers
took cells from his skin. They later injected one of the cells into
a cow egg and implanted it in a surrogate mother. She gave birth to
Second Chance Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's the oldest bull that's ever been cloned, and
it's the oldest male animal,'' said cloning project leader Mark
Westhusin, an associate professor of veterinary physiology and
pharmacology at Texas A&AMP;M. ``We're glad we got him.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of Connecticut got there first. In
June, they introduced Amy, a 94-pound Holstein, the first calf
cloned from an adult in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher doesn't care who was first. He is thrilled that his bull,
Chance, will live on in a clone that will be returned to him when
Texas A&AMP;M is finished studying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I care about my baby,'' said Fisher, who is 55 and put himself

CIVILIAN MILITIAS TAKING CONTROL IN EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SETH MYDANS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, Indonesia _ In an eerie, silent pre-dawn exodus, hundreds
of frightened East Timorese walked through dark streets Thursday
morning to board a giant ferry that docked here just long enough to
pick them up, then left again.
</P>
<P>
   With Indonesian security forces apparently under orders to do
nothing, this tiny provincial capital is coming increasingly under
the control of brutal, hard-eyed civilian militias, and people here
_ both local and foreign _ are terrified.
</P>
<P>
   Many are fleeing, driving across the border into neighboring
West Timor or trying to charter aircraft to fly out.
</P>
<P>
   The worsening situation is creating a diplomatic crisis, with
some nations threatening to send in their own troops to maintain
order and with the Indonesian government promising _ for at least
the fifth time _ to assert itself and bring order.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wiranto, the armed forces chief of staff, promised Thursday
to provide extra security for U.N. workers, who are counting the
ballots from a referendum Monday in which East Timor was to choose
whether to break away from Indonesia, which invaded and occupied it
in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   A huge turnout of nearly 99 percent of registered voters, in
defiance of a campaign of terror by the militias, has led many
experts to predict a strong vote for independence.
</P>
<P>
   President B.J. Habibie said he might be open to the deployment
of a U.N. peacekeeping force _ an extraordinary admission that his
own armed forces were not executing his stated policy of
controlling East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Condemnation of Indonesia's actions in East Timor came from
around the world. Citizens of some 70 nations have been taking part
in the U.N. program to organize the referendum and many are now
stranded here, unprotected.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. diplomat, Assistant Secretary of State Stanley Roth, said
there was no excuse for Indonesia's failure to bring order to this
tiny territory of 800,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actions by the Indonesian police and military have been
unacceptable,'' he said. ``They can't say they don't want the
international community to come in with peacekeepers if they're not
going to provide the security themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   With the words and deeds of Indonesian officials seeming to have
little relationship to each other, a key question has become where
the chain of command has broken down _ between the president and
the armed forces chief, between the chief and his generals, or
between the generals and their forces on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   With its long history of counterinsurgency here, the Indonesian
military has many means of asserting itself, some of which have
only a tenuous connection with the chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   But the sudden calm on election day, after intense pressure from
abroad to curtail the pre-election violence, seemed to demonstrate
that the authorities can switch the violence off and on as they
choose.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since early this year, the military has sought to undermine the
possibility of independence for East Timor by creating and arming
the militias. Some of these groups are believed to answer directly
to military officers.
</P>
<P>
   The police _ never known for their competence or professionalism
_ have been placed in an impossible situation, with the task of
controlling armed irregulars that are acting as surrogates for the
military.
</P>
<P>
   Looking on helplessly as militia members threatened to kidnap
one East Timorese man Thursday, a police colonel expressed his
frustration after four years of service here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a chessboard with 14 players and 30 spectators, all
with different agendas,'' said the officer, Lt. Col. J.J. Sitompul.
``And on the chessboard are two dogs, all ready to fight. We, the
police, have to keep the two dogs apart, and both the dogs can bite
the police. That is my philosophy. The words are polite, but the
feelings are bitter.''
</P>
<P>
   As the police stand aside, the militias have become increasingly
brazen and visible in Dili since the voting.
</P>
<P>
   They have begun watching the hotels where foreigners from around
the city have gathered for safety. At one point Thursday two armed
men entered the Turismo Hotel, shouted threats and kicked a
Canadian election observer.
</P>
<P>
   They have made the airport their turf, wandering unimpeded
through restricted areas and seeking to prevent East Timorese from
leaving.
</P>
<P>
   In their black T-shirts they roam the streets on motorcycles,
sometimes displaying weapons. They have set up roadblocks around
the city and the countryside, peering at passengers inside vehicles
and sometimes seizing East Timorese who do not please them for one
reason or another.
</P>
<P>
   There were both police and military officers present on
Wednesday when the militias threatened the U.N. compound and killed
three people in a running battle with pro-independence thugs on the
street outside.
</P>
<P>
   But the police did little to control the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that we would not be in a position to have
prevented the worst violence if the mob had indeed attempted to
attack the compound itself,'' said Ian Martin, chief of the U.N.
mission here.

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or
noteworthy movies and film series. X denotes a highly recommended
film or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `THE ASTRONAUT'S WIFE,' starring Johnny Depp and Charlize
Theron. Written and directed by Rand Ravich (R, 100 minutes).
Stylish direction and the heat generated by these two stars can't
outweigh the familiarity of the story line. It concerns an
astronaut who returns to Earth behaving a little strangely. And not
for nothing does Ms. Theron, as the title character, wear the
hairdo seen on Mia Farrow in ``Rosemary's Baby.'' Even creatures in
other galaxies can guess what's coming. Still, the visual style
suggests that this first-time director might fare better with
fresher material. And Depp holds interest by playing the astronaut
as one part NASA, two parts Elvis. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   X `AUTUMN TALE,' starring Beatrice Romand, Marie Riviere, Didier
Sandre, Alain Libolt and Alexia Portal. Directed by Eric Rohmer
(PG, 110 minutes; in French with English subtitles). The final
chapter of the director's ``Tales of the Four Seasons'' is as
sublimely warming an experience as the autumn sun that shines
benevolently on the Rhone Valley vineyard owned by the central
character, Magali (Ms. Romand). The movie follows the adventures of
this wiry and vital but lonely widowed mother of two after she
allows two friends to play matchmaker. The film's plot, like that
of other Rohmer movies, is mathematically schematic as the
characters indulge in exquisitely verbalized soul-searching. As
sensuously gratifying as it is civilized, with a wonderful
performance by Ms. Romand, it reaches a happy ending that feels
entirely earned. (Stephen Holden)
</P>
<P>
   `THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT,' starring Heather Donahue, Michael
Williams and Joshua Leonard. Directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo
Sanchez (R, 87 minutes). A horror film shot outdoors by its actors,
who play three scared filmmakers at work on a spooky documentary,
this is a fine example of how to make something out of nothing _
nothing but terrific imagination and a game plan so enterprising it
should elevate its creators to pinup status at film schools
everywhere. With tentacles including a hit Web site, an elaborate
fake witch mythology, a book tie-in, a special on the Sci-Fi
Channel and much more, this clever little indie is at the center of
a new form of synergy and an inspired multimedia blitz. (Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   X `THE BUENA VISTA SOCIAL CLUB,' with Ibrahim Ferrer, Compay
Segundo and Ry Cooder. Directed by Wim Wenders (not rated, 106
minutes). When the American guitarist and producer Ry Cooder
assembled a group of all-but-forgotten Cuban musicians to record an
album, no one expected that the record would become a phenomenon,
selling more than 1 million copies worldwide and revitalizing the
Cuban music scene. Wenders' ebullient documentary follows the group
on tour from Amsterdam to New York and includes interviews with the
group's main members. The music pulsates, and the pictures of
Havana compare the city's grand but faded architecture with the
musicians' weather-beaten faces. (Holden)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   `DEEP BLUE SEA,' starring Saffron Burrows, Thomas Jane, L L Cool
J, Jacqueline McKenzie, Michael Rapaport, Stellan Skarsgard and
Samuel L. Jackson. Directed by Renny Harlin (R, 100 minutes).
Better not mess with Mother Nature. That's the familiar message of
this man-against-shark horror film in which the research team of a
floating ocean laboratory is stalked by three 8,000-pound
genetically ``improved'' mako sharks. Ms. Burrows is the chilly,
anything-for-science marine biologist behind the research, and Jane
the hunky shark-wrangler who tends these razor-toothed killing
machines. ``Titanic'' meets ``Jaws,'' without romance, history,
myth or credible characters, only nonstop action and half an ocean
full of crimson, blood-thickened water. (Holden)
</P>
<P>
   `DUDLEY DO-RIGHT,' starring Brendan Fraser, Alfred Molina, Sarah
Jessica Parker and Eric Idle. Directed by Hugh Wilson (PG, 90
minutes). Based on the vintage Jay Ward animated series, this
live-action romp tries to be both zany entertainment for children
and nostalgia for those who grew up on Ward's snarky creations
(including Rocky, Bullwinkle et al). And it works pretty well, too.
Beyond the sure-fire goofy presence of Fraser and the comic
possibilities of a Canadian Mountie who rides his horse backward,
this jokey romp has an appealing, try-anything spirit. The
characters now use cell phones. And Ms. Parker's Nell, who formerly
spent her time tied to the railroad tracks, has become a former
U.S. ambassador to Guam. But the formula hasn't lost its fun.
(Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   X `EYES WIDE SHUT,' starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
Directed by Stanley Kubrick (R, 145 minutes). This last cryptic,
spellbinding addition to the Kubrick canon provides a stunning
epiphany for the summer of the dirty joke. It's a dead-serious film
about eros and mortality, one that flirts with the ridiculous but
sustains its fundamental eeriness and gravity throughout. Cruise,
as a doctor caught up in a nighttime sexual odyssey of strange,
dreamlike clarity, and Ms. Kidman, as the wife who sparks his
jealousy by speaking frankly of her own libido, give themselves
over body and soul to the filmmaker's meticulous and delicately
balanced scheme. Given the dark themes and explicit nudity found
here, the R rating (achieved by digital alterations to 65 seconds'
worth of film) is a joke. (Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   X `GRAND ILLUSION,' starring Jean Gabin, Pierre Fresnay and
Erich von Stroheim. Directed by Jean Renoir (not rated, 117
minutes; in French with English subtitles). An oasis of subtlety,
moral intelligence and deep emotion on the cinematic landscape this
summer. And the third inspired reissue in three years from Rialto
Pictures, which previously resurrected Godard's ``Contempt'' and
Fellini's ``Nights of Cabiria.'' As this 1937 masterpiece refracts
wartime through the peculiar civility of life in German-run prison
camps, it creates a rich and stirring vision of all that war
destroys. And the sole casualty in one of the most devastating
films about battle is a man who dies in bed. (Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `THE HAUNTING,' starring Liam Neeson, Lili Taylor, Catherine
Zeta-Jones and Owen Wilson. Directed by Jan De Bont (PG-13, 117
minutes). In a wildly overdone haunted house with a Gothic nouveau
riche look, walls warp, statues morph and things go bump in the
night. The special effects are piled on so relentlessly that after
a while the sight of the flying cow from De Bont's ``Twister''
would not be amiss. Firmly committed to the idea that more is more,
this is a remake of a 1963 black-and-white film that left much more
to the imagination. But the cast is good; Neeson plays the doctor
who leads the other three principals to Hill House for a psychology
experiment that goes really, really wrong. (Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `ILLUMINATA,' starring John Turturro, Katherine Borowitz, Susan
Sarandon, Rufus Sewell, Christopher Walken and Donal McCann.
Directed by Turturro (R, 111 minutes). An enormously fond homage to
the world of acting, beguilingly presented and full of knowing
backstage humor. The usual suspects _ the aging diva (Ms.
Sarandon), the self-involved leading man ( Sewell), the idealistic
aspiring playwright ( Turturro) _ are played invigoratingly, as is
Walken's snide Transylvanian-sounding critic. Turturro and Ms.
Borowitz, his somberly beautiful wife, play out a delicate balance
of love and ambition against this nicely tumultuous backdrop.
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   . `INSPECTOR GADGET,' starring Matthew Broderick and Rupert
Everett. Directed by David Kellogg (PG, 85 minutes). The midmorning
midden of children's cartoons that yielded a vein of cinematic gold
with ``George of the Jungle'' has now been mined for this clinker.
Too bad, because this Disney comedy wastes good talent. Broderick
brings an endearing combination of intelligence, wit and naivete to
his portrayal of a security guard who is transformed into the human
gizmo, Inspector Gadget, after being blown up in an effort to
capture a megalomaniacal magnate ( Everett). But even Broderick can
go only so far with the film's noisy, childish material. Watching
this movie is like watching a human Swiss army knife for nearly an
hour and a half. It's a remarkable device, but do you really want
to spend a lot of time with a not-too-bright hardware store
Frankenstein creation that can light cigars with his thumb, shoot a
grappling hook to the top of a skyscraper and produce a helicopter
from his head? (Lawrence Van Gelder)
</P>
<P>
   `THE IRON GIANT,' with the voices of Elie Marienthal and Harry
Connick Jr. Directed by Brad Bird (PG, 90 minutes). Based loosely
on a children's fable written in 1968 by Ted Hughes, this film
looks at the fearful years of the Cold War through the politically
correct lens of the 1990s. All this re-examination of the
atmosphere of the post-Sputnik era is wrapped up in the story of a
bright (and therefore unpopular) little boy who befriends a
50-foot-tall iron robot from who knows where that plunges into the
sea one stormy night in 1957 and comes ashore near Rockwell, Maine.
The boy, Hogarth Hughes, saves the giant when it becomes entangled
in high-tension wires, and the big lug becomes his secret playmate.
Meanwhile, a nasty, paranoid government agent is closing in on the
giant, leading to a showdown with the military. ``The Iron Giant''
is a smooth, skilled example of animated filmmaking. Many parents
will doubtless approve of the film's messages while they ponder how
the passing years have smoothed the jagged edges of history. (Van
Gelder)
</P>
<P>
   X `MY LIFE SO FAR,' starring Colin Firth, Rosemary Harris, Irene
Jacob, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Malcolm McDowell and Robert
Norman. Directed by Hugh Hudson (PG-13, 93 minutes). A steady
``Masterpiece Theater''-like glow warms ``My Life So Far,'' a boy's
reverie of growing up in the misty Scottish highlands of Argyll in
the late 1920s. Frisky little Fraser ( Norman), who narrates the
story, recalls a year in the life of the mildly troubled Macintosh
clan. What strife there is mostly involves his father, Edward (
Firth), an eccentric fiery-eyed inventor, and his Uncle Morris (
McDowell), who brings home a beautiful French wife (Ms. Jacob),
with whom Edward falls in love. If the story is slight, it is
smoothly told and well acted (especially by Firth), and the
nostalgic atmosphere is beguiling. (Holden)

   `MYSTERY MEN,' starring William H. Macy, Ben Stiller, Hank
Azaria, Janeane Garofalo and Geoffrey Rush. Directed by Kinka Usher
(PG-13, 100 minutes). Based on a comic book, this satire on the
superhero genre has a fine deadpan cast and a funny premise, even
if its skit-worthy material is allowed to run out of steam. Its
characters are lovable losers, convinced that superhero status is
mostly a state of mind and can be achieved even if one's secret
power is throwing forks or hoisting a shovel. Macy sets the
entertainingly tongue-in-cheek tone as the intrepid Shoveler, but
Usher does some shoveling, too. His film loads up on so many jokey
characters that it begins to be as overblown as a ``Batman'' _ and
not so far removed from the genre it mocks. (Maslin)

<P>
   `THE RED VIOLIN,' starring Samuel L. Jackson, Jason Flemying,
Greta Scacchi and Don McKellar. Directed by Francois Girard (not
rated, 130 minutes). ``The Red Violin'' follows the colorful
300-plus-year journey of a priceless violin from its construction
in an Italian workshop in 1681 to a contemporary auction in
Montreal. As it makes its way from Vienna to England to China, the
instrument becomes the inspiration for some richly photographed
historical tableaux. If the movie's narrative energy is undermined
by a plodding screenplay and wooden acting, the music, composed by
John Corigliano and played by Joshua Bell and the London
Philharmonia Orchestra, is sublime. (Holden)
</P>
<P>
   `RUNAWAY BRIDE,' starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere.
Directed by Garry Marshall (PG, 110 minutes). When the stars and
director first collaborated, on ``Pretty Woman,'' Ms. Roberts was
cast as an adorable Los Angeles streetwalker. Nine years later,
she's as far as she can get from Rodeo Drive, geographically and
otherwise. Playing the stern proprietor of a small-town Maryland
hardware store, she takes an awfully long while to slip from
scowling into flirtatious romantic-comedy mode. And when the sparks
start flying between her character and Gere's likably stubborn
newspaper columnist, they fly on cue. Funny minor characters and
one-liners offset the not-so-pretty story of a woman who habitually
jilts her men. (Maslin)

<P>
   `THE SIXTH SENSE,' starring Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment.
Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan (PG-13, 107 minutes).
What starts out as a horror movie about a troubled 8-year-old boy (
Osment) who claims to see dead people, and the child psychologist (
Willis) determined to cure him, eventually turns into New Age mush
(think ``What Dreams May Come'' and ``Simon Birch''). When you
trace the plot backward after its big secret is revealed, the story
doesn't begin to add up. Willis gives his usual smirking one-note
performance. What empathy the movie generates comes from Osment's
intense portrayal of the tormented child. (Holden)
</P>
<P>
   X `STAR WARS: EPISODE I _ THE PHANTOM MENACE,' starring Liam
Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Jake Lloyd. Directed by
George Lucas (PG-13, 132 minutes). Stripped of hype and breathless
expectations, Lucas' first installment offers a happy surprise:
it's up to snuff. It sustains the gee-whiz spirit of the series and
offers a swashbuckling extra-galactic getaway, creating illusions
that are even more plausible than the kitchen-raiding raptors of
``Jurassic Park.'' While the human stars here are indeed reduced to
playing action figures, they are upstaged by amazing backdrops and
hordes of crazily lifelike space beings as the Lewis Carroll in
Lucas is given free rein. The ``Star Wars'' franchise was funnier
and scrappier when it was new, but it simply wasn't capable of this
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `T-REX: BACK TO THE CRETACEOUS,' starring Peter Horton and Liz
Stauber. Directed by Brett Leonard (not rated; 45 minutes).
Passions for the prehistoric that remain unsated after the two
``Jurassic Park'' films are likely to be requited by this latest
Imax 3-D film. Drooling and menacing, the monsters of the Mesozoic
are on the march again in this brief, enjoyable dip into
paleontology, teen-age adventure and parent-child relationships.
Seen in 3-D and set against the lush ferns, moss and ancient trees
of the Olympic rain forest in the state of Washington, these
creatures seem marvelously lifelike. Better yet, ``T-Rex,'' written
by Andrew Gellis and Jeanne Rosenberg, doesn't rest on its
technological splendors. Its time-tripping story takes the viewer
to a paleontological dig, raises unanswered scientific questions
and introduces some of the major figures in the history of the
subject. To be sure, seeing ``T-Rex'' won't qualify anyone for a
doctorate in paleontology, but the film is likely to whet active
young minds to learn more about the past. (Van Gelder)
</P>
<P>
   X `TARZAN,' with the voices of Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver,
Rosie O'Donnell and Nigel Hawthorne. Directed by Kevin Lima and
Chris Buck (G, 88 minutes). No need to wonder how this animated
Tarzan movie could improve on the 47 others that preceded it.
Disney animation turns the hero into a supple, long-haired hunk,
lets the apes talk to him and whooshes through lush jungle settings
with exultant agility. This ``Tarzan'' is sprightly and likable in
ways that are hard to resist, with lively vocal performances,
excitingly kinetic animation and Phil Collins singing tunefully in
the background. Parents will stay awake, and children will be
charmed. (Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `TEACHING MRS. TINGLE,' starring Helen Mirren, Katie Holmes,
Marisa Coughlan and Barry Watson. Written and directed by Kevin
Williamson (PG-13, 93 minutes). Three teen-agers dislike their
nasty history teacher, so they go to her house, tie her to her bed
and hold her hostage. Surely this had a more honest viciousness
when it was first written by Williamson, who went on to write the
``Scream'' movies, ``Dawson's Creek'' and ``I Know What You Did
Last Summer,'' but it has been absurdly soft-pedaled into a kinder,
gentler version. Retitled ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle'' from ``Killing
Mrs. Tingle,'' and no doubt with its ending changed accordingly, it
works overtime trying to make the high schoolers sympathetic. As
the teacher, Ms. Mirren is much too good for this material.
(Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `THE 13TH WARRIOR,' starring Antonio Banderas and Omar Sharif.
Directed by John McTiernan (R, 103 minutes). Set in the 10th
century and adapted from a novel by Michael Crichton, this
grunting, sweating, blood-gushing medieval answer to professional
wrestling is inspired by Ahmed Ibn Fadhlan's historical account of
his adventures in Central Asia. Banderas plays an exiled Persian
poet who hooks up with a group of Norse warriors to do battle with
an evil tribe of flesh-eaters. The screenplay is monosyllabic, but
the action scenes, which take you into the thick of battle, are
excitingly photographed. A charging score by Jerry Goldsmith helps
ennoble the grisly derring-do (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR,' starring Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo
and Denis Leary. Directed by John McTiernan (R, 114 minutes). It
was the stars, Faye Dunaway and Steve McQueen, who made this story
sexy the first time around; now it's the showy big-ticket
accouterments. Brosnan and Ms. Russo seem to share the most
heartfelt moment in this halfhearted romance when they jointly go
shopping. McTiernan is better known for the action in his ``Die
Hard'' and other movies than for the tender moments therein. So the
museum heists here are more convincing and exciting than the scenes
of carefully staged amour. (Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `TRICK,' starring Christian Campbell and John Paul Pitoc.
Directed by Jim Fall (R, 90 minutes). This engaging, tenderhearted
boy-meets-boy story features two handsome, doe-eyed actors in the
story of a romantic one-night stand. As in the Doris Day-era sex
comedies that are recalled here, the story is filled with obstacles
to the affair, the most noxious of them Tori Spelling in the role
of an incorrigible nuisance. Fall gives a small-town coziness to
his film's Greenwich Village settings and makes this a quaintly
likable date movie for audiences of any persuasion. (Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   X `TWIN FALLS IDAHO,' starring Michael and Mark Polish and
Michele Hicks. Directed by Michael Polish (R, 100 minutes). This
eerily effective film carries the real-life closeness of twin
brothers into the realm of haunting fantasy. The look-alike Polish
siblings play conjoined twins whose delicately balanced
interdependence yields a rare brand of tension. With a bleak,
lonely look and a strain of black humor (in their three-legged
suit, the film's Falls brothers impress everyone on Halloween), the
film introduces a wild, gorgeous young woman into their lives and
watches what happens when one twin starts to court her. The story
is intensely rendered, without gimmicks. (Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `WILD WILD WEST,' starring Will Smith, Kevin Kline, Kenneth
Branagh and Salma Hayek. Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld (PG-13, 107
minutes). Another big, lavish movie with no there there. This
post-Civil War James Bondish contraption-happy sci-fi film is hard
to categorize, a quality not to be confused with originality.
Directed by Sonnenfeld without the deadpan-alien sensibility that
worked for ``Men in Black,'' this stylistic grab bag is similarly
kinky but a lot more chaotic, however heroically Smith, as a newly
hunky and debonair action hero, tries to save the day. Good-looking
but dopey, with an emphasis on toylike but vaguely ghoulish special
effects. A movie with that much potential kiddie appeal didn't have
to start in a bordello, either. (Maslin)

AUTO TECHNOLOGY: SHIFTING AWAY FROM `PRNDL' AUTOMATIC
TRANSMISSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers

 (bl)  
 By JIM McCRAW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For some 30 years now, the shift pattern for an automatic
transmission hasn't varied much from Park, Reverse, Neutral, Drive
and Low, a PRNDL pattern from which Detroit has coined a word:
Prindle. That's because Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 102
says the pattern must be consistent, for safety reasons _ mainly to
prevent motorists from misshifting when they start to drive away.
</P>
<P>
   Before that standard was issued in 1966, manufacturers were free
to develop any sequence they wanted for automatic shifters, and
some used unusual patterns in places that may seem odd today.
Chrysler Corp.'s cars of 1955-56 had levers that protruded from the
instrument panel, followed in 1957-64 by push-button shifters at
the left side of the dashboard. Ford Motor Co.'s ill-fated Edsel of
1958-60 had shifter push buttons mounted in the hub of the steering
wheel.
</P>
<P>
   But now, at a time when technology is rapidly changing the way
that cars work and the ways that drivers control them, some
manufacturers would not only like to alter the pattern, they'd like
to put the shifter somewhere besides the steering column or the
floor console, the two places the federal government requires.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, BMW petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration to change vehicle standard 102. The German
manufacturer would like to free up space on the center console for
things like in-car entertainment systems, cellular telephones, CD
changers, navigation systems _ even televisions and electronic
games.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Patterson, a BMW staff safety engineer, said that most
modern automatic transmissions are shifted electronically anyway,
and that the shifter simply activates electric solenoids rather
than moving cables or levers to change gears. He says the
electronic technology exists to use smaller, lighter push buttons,
a key pad, or a rotary display. He says that the push buttons, a
key pad or a rotary display could then be mounted on the dashboard,
on the console _ or even on the steering wheel like the shifters
used in Formula One racing.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, until the federal standard is changed, no
manufacturer is free to relocate the shifter or change the
traditional Prindle pattern, which reads left to right on a
column-mounted shifter or front to back on the console.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of opinion as to what the standard actually
says,'' Patterson said. ``The standard doesn't say you must use
PRNDL. Logic and industry practice says that park must be next to
reverse, and neutral must be between reverse and drive, and you
have to have a means for low. It's a matter of logic that you get
to PRNDL in terms of requirements, and it's written with a
gearshift lever in mind. That's what we asked NHTSA to clarify, and
that's why we want to have a new rule. We'd really like to do
this.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The industry's two largest lobbying groups, the American
Automobile Manufacturers Association and the Association of Import
Automobile Manufacturers, have filed a joint comment in support of
a change.
</P>
<P>
   The comment says, in part, ``We note that nonserially shiftable
designs, such as joysticks, key pads and touch screens, can be
designed to provide a functionally equivalent `dead zone' between
forward and reverse gears.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The NHTSA's mandatory 90-day comment-gathering period, during
which industry, government, the public and safety lobbyists can
express their views, expired Sept. 2, and now the agency is in the
throes of deciding whether to accede to the industry's wishes or
keep standard 102 as it is. Officials at the agency had no comment.

 &HT;    DEWINE ENDORSES MCCAIN FOR PRESIDENT
 &HT;    330&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT MONTGOMERY
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bucking a tide of support for Texas Gov. George W.
Bush throughout the GOP and his own state of Ohio, Sen. Mike DeWine
on Thursday endorsed Sen. John McCain for president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   DeWine spoke with reporters by telephone about his decision
before boarding a plane to New Hampshire, where he will appear with
the Arizona senator to formalize the endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``My strong, strong belief is that the next president has to be
a great leader in foreign affairs,'' DeWine said. ``When you're
dealing with foreign affairs, this is the man in the room.''
</P>
<P>
   In siding with McCain, DeWine joins a dark-horse campaign in a
year when the front-runner, Bush, has lapped the field in raising
money and gaining endorsements. In Ohio alone, Bush has gained the
support of the governor and nine of 11 Republican members of the
U.S. House. The highest-ranking holdout is Sen. George Voinovich,
who hasn't endorsed anyone.
</P>
<P>
   DeWine will become one of six national co-chairmen for the
McCain campaign. The others are Sens. Fred Thompson of Tennessee,
Chuck Hagel of Nebraska and Jon Kyl of Arizona, as well as former
Sen. Warren Rudman of New Hampshire and prominent New York
businesswoman Georgette Mosbacher.
</P>
<P>
   McCain issued a statement praising DeWine as he accepted the
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike and I have fought to reform the way the federal
government works, take better care of our citizens and reduce the
tax burden on America's working families,'' McCain said. ``With
Mike's help, I know my campaign of independent conservative reform
will be successful next year in Ohio and across the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   DeWine wouldn't talk about the other Republican candidates in
the race, but he repeatedly discussed McCain's experience in
international matters, which is considered a Bush weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a very perilous time that I don't think most
Americans fully appreciate,'' DeWine said, ``so foreign policy for
me is absolutely the deciding factor.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   DeWine cited the matter of America's military presence in
Lebanon in the early 1980s. He said he still remembers a powerful
speech McCain made when he and DeWine both were in the House,
opposing then-President Reagan's decision to stay in Lebanon. A
month later a terrorist bomb destroyed a U.S. military barracks and
killed 241 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He voted one way, most of us voted the other way,'' DeWine
said. ``He was right, I was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain is a former fighter pilot who became a national hero
after spending six years in a Vietnam prison camp, refusing to
accept early release because his father was a Navy admiral.
</P>
<P>
   ``To know him is to be inspired by him,'' DeWine said in a
statement before taking questions. ``I know that when John McCain
leads, people follow. He is decisive, he has guts. He leaves no
room for ambiguity and uncertainty in his reasoned policy
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain is seen around Washington as a maverick who has almost
gleefully challenged leaders of the Republican Party on such things
as campaign finance reform. Despite the best efforts of party
leaders, McCain has pushed a bill that would ban unlimited ``soft
money'' contributions to political parties, used to circumvent
spending limits for individual candidates.
</P>
<P>
   DeWine opposes the McCain bill and said he hasn't changed is
opinion on the matter. He said his endorsement of McCain is based
on their lengthy friendship, which began in 1982, when they both
first entered the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm saying by this endorsement is I've watched this
man,'' DeWine said. ``This man is a leader and he's a man who I
want to be commander in chief.''

 &HT;    More U.S. investment in East Africa encouraged
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The prime minister of Uganda issued an appeal Thursday
for more U.S. investment in East Africa, pointing to political and
economic reforms that have swept the three-nation market of 80
million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is common knowledge that in the past many credible
investors avoided Uganda because life was short, brutal and
nasty,'' Prime Minister Apollo Nsibami told an East African
investment conference at the Carter Center in Atlanta. ``The past
mistakes are being addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Idi Amin and Milton Obote dictatorships were blamed for the
slaughter of 800,000 Ugandans during the 1970s and 1980s. Nsibami
noted that a new politically stable government led by President
Yoweri Museveni replaced ``the erratic and brutal political
regimes'' in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya are all pressing forward with
political reforms and dismantling ``corrupt monopolies'' as well as
establishing a free trade zone that will cover their combined
populations, Nsibami said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make good money in Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, which
can be fully repatriated to the USA and elsewhere because
restrictions on currency transfers are disappearing,'' said the
University of Chicago-educated prime minister. ``Indeed, in Uganda,
there are no currency restrictions.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade summit was organized by Kenyans, Tanzanians and
Ugandans living and working in the United States. More than 100
people attended.
</P>
<P>
   The conference was sponsored by Coca-Cola Co., Western Union,
Delta Air Lines and other U.S. companies with African operations.
Ambassadors to the United States from the three countries took
part.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Powell, principal deputy assistant secretary of state for
African affairs, said U.S. trade and investment with Africa has
grown by leaps and bounds during the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   But only 1 percent of all U.S. foreign investment is in Africa
and the continent is still ``the last frontier for U.S. trade and
investment,'' she said. ``U.S. companies are behind the curve.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is seeking to expand economic ties
with Africa by supporting African trade legislation in Congress,
beefing up Commerce Department staff stationed in African countries
and through debt relief and investment programs, Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater will host a U.S.-Africa
transportation summit in Atlanta on Sept. 27-29, also at the Carter
Center. The discussion will focus on aviation, highway and other
transportation issues, the Transportation Department said.

 &HT;    CONGRESS IS SHORT OF FUNDS FOR ITS LAST SPENDING BILL
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Sept. 5.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress opens its fall session Wednesday without
any agreement on how to avoid huge spending cuts next year in some
of the most popular federal programs.
</P>
<P>
   The hundreds of programs that would be on the chopping block
include aid to public schools and college students, the operational
costs of Medicare and Head Start, nursing home inspections, medical
research, summer jobs for teens and retraining for dislocated
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats agree that the social and political
consequences of brutal cuts in those programs would be too
devastating to allow. In fact, Democrats want to increase spending
on education and Republicans want to increase spending on medical
research.
</P>
<P>
   But the leaders made no attempt during their August break to
agree on how to do that. Instead, they spent most of their public
appearances debating the pros and cons of a tax-cut bill that few
believe will ever become law.
</P>
<P>
   The programs at risk are paid for annually by an appropriation
bill for three departments: Labor, Health and Human Services, and
Education. Called the ``Labor-HHS'' bill for short, it is
traditionally the last of the 13 annual appropriation bills to get
through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The House is scheduled to start work on its version of the
Labor-HHS bill within the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The budget arithmetic for the Labor-HHS bill is brutal:
</P>
<P>
   _ Mainstream education and medical research organizations are
lobbying for a $93 billion version, and President Clinton asked for
about $92 billion.
</P>
<P>
   _ A ``freeze'' extending this year's programs for another year
without any adjustment for inflation would cost $89 billion.
</P>
<P>
   _ But under the budget plans Republicans adopted early this
year, the Senate has only $81 billion and the House has less than
$74 billion left for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The result could be program cuts of 10 to 18 percent below the
``freeze'' level, and deeper in many cases. For example, if
Congress decided that instead of cutting research funds for the
National Institutes of Health, it will freeze them, the other
programs would have to be slashed by an average of 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking a way out, the Senate, the House and Clinton face two
unpalatable options:
</P>
<P>
   _ Offset the extra cost by spending less on other federal
programs, or by increasing federal receipts _ the opposite of
cutting taxes. Neither the administration nor Congress has accepted
the other's ideas about how to do that.
</P>
<P>
   _ Approve the extra money without offsets, perhaps using
creative bookkeeping to obscure that fact.
</P>
<P>
   The second option is the simplest. But it would require a delay
of at least one year in the fulfillment of pledges by Clinton to
``save Social Security first'' or by Republicans to create a
``Social Security lock box.''
</P>
<P>
   Those slogans are political shorthand for using the Social
Security surplus solely to pay down the national debt. The idea is
that as the debt _ and annual interest payments on it _ shrink, it
will be easier for the federal government to pay for Social
Security benefits when the baby boomers retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that everyone has made promises they can't
keep,'' said James Horney, who coordinated official budget
projections for Congress for seven years before joining the private
Center for Budget and Policy Priorities in July. ``I think
everyone's hoping for a miracle, but no one knows what it will
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither party wants to be the first to suggest a one-year
extension of the long custom of borrowing a small portion of the
Social Security surplus to pay government operating expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president thinks we should use Social Security money,
he should let us know, and if he chooses to pay for it some other
way, he should let us know,'' Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., chairman of
the House Republican Conference, said in an interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democratic president won't be trapped by the ``cynical
and wrong'' strategy of the Republicans, according to John Podesta,
the White House chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Press Club, Podesta recalled news reports that
House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, advocates ``underfunding
some of those important bills, like Labor-HHS ... in order to jam
the president into dipping into the Social Security Trust Fund,
which they have pledged not to raid.''
</P>
<P>
   Podesta said, ``Ultimately, I think, the Republican leadership
and the Democratic leadership and we in the administration are
going to have to sit down and try to work through this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not bent on a showdown with the president,'' Watts said.
``We're willing to work with him.''

and cigarette lighters, in addition to a large, powerful engine,
the traditional windshield, saddle bags, cargo box and plenty of
cushy seat room for two. They are, essentially, two-wheeled cars.

convertible models. Nor is the 3-Series coupe a wild departure from
the sedan in matters stylistic and mechanical. But it is by no

   But of these microchips, which can number about two dozen, ``the
vast majority have no date functionality whatsoever,'' said General
Motors spokesman John Ahearne. In other words, when it comes to the
date, these computers don't ask and don't care, and can't fall
victim to the Year 2000 bug.
</P>
<P>
   In cars that have a dashboard indicator for oil changes, the
computer still does not care about the date, the manufacturers say.
``If the car sits in your garage for a year, your oil light is not
going to come on,'' said Ford Motor spokeswoman Kathleen Vokes. It
counts miles, not days, she said.
</P>
<P>
   About the only computer that may track the date is the one that
displays the date as well as the time for the driver. Those too
will work properly, said Joseph Majcher, director of Engineering
Y2K Readiness at GM. He said his company had started putting
microchips in cars about 15 years ago, and for the last two years
has been checking that they were all ready for 2000. They are, he
insisted.
</P>
<P>
   That should leave no problems at all, except for the card-swipe
unit on the gasoline pump, the electricity to run the pump, the
street lights and your home garage door opener _ and, of course,
the computer that runs the traffic lights.
</P>
<P>
   The President's Council on the Year 2000 Conversion reported
Aug. 5 that power, telecommunications and most other vital
functions appeared highly likely to work just fine. But the 911
emergency system might not function normally in all cities, the
report said. It did not say anything about the computers that
process traffic tickets issued on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   The car companies, of course, have other Year 2000 worries, like
whether their factories will keep running. Ms. Vokes said that Ford
did not think it would have problems but would have a special crew
on duty at its world headquarters in Dearborn, Mich., just in case,
and that that was where she would be spending New Year's Eve. To
prove that that her car was all right, she said, ``maybe I should
just drive around world headquarters.''

 &HT;    Some school districts to defy ban on pre-game prayers
 &HT;    By Becky Bell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ In the wake of a federal court ruling,
organized silence will help kick off the football season tonight in
the East Texas Bible belt where pregame prayers over the public
address system has long been looked upon as a sacred tradition.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held that a
Texas school district's policy allowing invocations and
benedictions at high school football games violated the
Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution. The legal
opinion was handed down in the case of Doe V. Santa Fe Independent
School District.
</P>
<P>
   The court upheld a lower court's decision allowing limited
prayer at graduation ceremonies, but ruled out prayers or other
solemnizing ceremonies before football games.
</P>
<P>
   The Fifth Circuit Court has jurisdiction over Texas, Louisiana
and Mississippi, so the decision is binding on all Texas school
districts.
</P>
<P>
   The Longview News-Journal newspaper contacted school districts
in 11 counties this week to find out how prayer at Friday night
football games would be handled.
</P>
<P>
   Not one school gave the same answer, and no superintendents said
they were glad to see the tradition discontinued.
</P>
<P>
   And at a couple of school districts, the tradition will
continue, despite a warning from the Texas Association of School
Boards (TASB) that districts that continue to allow
school-sponsored prayer at football games are taking significant
legal risks.
</P>
<P>
   The statement from the association states that a person
challenging the practice could recover injunctive relief, monetary
damages, court costs and attorney's fees from the district.
Individual trustees and school district employees could face
similar penalties for allowing the practice, and immunity would not
be available, TASB said.
</P>
<P>
   Waskom Independent School District Superintendent Richard Cook
said the school board made a unanimous decision at a special
meeting Monday to continue prayer at football games, despite the
legal risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically most of the superintendents were going to continue
doing what they had done in the past until they got the TASB fax,''
Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he shared the information he received about prayer,
including the TASB document, and told trustees they would be
breaking the law if they continued the practice. Cook said he gave
the board five options regarding the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first option was to not pray, the second option was to
have an announcement that said the Fifth Circuit ruling made
praying at the game unconstitutional, the third option was to have
a moment of silence, the fourth option was to have a student-led,
student initiated prayer and the fifth option was to have a school
board member conduct the prayer,'' Cook said. ``They chose the last
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's meeting drew a larger than usual crowd, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally at our school board meetings, we have 15 spectators
maximum,'' Cook said. ``There were about 120 people, and we
specifically asked if anyone opposed it, because we wanted to hear
their particular concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook said no one spoke against school board members leading the
prayer before each game. Cook said he has the support of those who
matter most.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it should be a community decision. The community is
who the school is there to serve,'' Cook said. `` I don't think
someone outside the community saying what the community desires is
appropriate, and I don't think that's what's intended in our
particular government system.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilgore Independent School District Superintendent Jerry Roberts
said the district will continue to have prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the community will expect us to do as we always have
done, and that's how we've always opened our game,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said he did not know who would lead the prayer at the
game on Sept. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Longview Independent School District officials who as recently
as Monday said they planned to allow the traditional pre-game
prayer, have reversed themselves. Wednesday, on the advice of their
attorney, Longview ISD issued a statement saying, ``Longview ISD
can no longer continue the inclusion of student-initiated prayer at
school sporting events.''
</P>
<P>
   The prepared statement said attorneys had warned the district
that ``activist groups and individuals may be vigilant in watching
for violations.''
</P>
<P>
   Longview Superintendent Arthur Culver said the district can't
risk breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really regret that we can't continue the tradition
established here for quite some time. We don't like it, but we must
follow the law,'' Culver said. ``We can't afford to put the
district in a predicament where it could receive punitive damages
that could reach an extreme amount.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Gary Shaver, who represents several area school
districts including Longview, believes the prayer issue is causing
a furor because it's more than a legal issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an ethical and moral issue for a lot of school
districts,'' Shaver said. ``In my own personal opinion, I don't
believe the expression of one's faith is offensive. I don't see how
that could possibly be.''

BMW'S 3-SERIES COUPES: MORE OF EVERYTHING WITH TWO FEWER DOORS 
</HEADLINE>

 By DAN NEIL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The news that BMW has begun building two-door versions of its
acclaimed 3-Series barely qualifies as news. The German company
routinely introduces a new series in sedan form _ in this case, the
so-called E46 platform, which arrived last year _ then elaborates
at regular intervals with coupe and convertible models.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the 3-Series coupe a wild departure from the sedan in
matters stylistic and mechanical.
</P>
<P>
   But it is by no means an insignificant car, just as no piece in
chess is insignificant. With the new coupe, BMW advances yet
another pawn to pin down opponents in yet another sub-segment of
the market. In the 2000 model year, BMW will offer everything from
bumblebee roadsters (the Z3 2.3) to Galaxy-class battleships (the
12-cylinder 750iL light-armored sedan); from compact wagons (the
emerging 3-Series wagon) to the X5 ``sport activity vehicle''; from
this fall's ferocious 400-horsepower M5 performance sedan to James
Bond's new grocery-getter, the stunning Z8 convertible.
</P>
<P>
   And, by the way, the company also makes motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   At every turn, BMW seeks to box in and triangulate its
competition with a multiplicity of platforms, options, engines and
trim levels. For instance, the new 328Ci, with a base price of
$34,560, nearly splits the price difference between the Saab 9-3 SE
($31,700) and the Volvo C70 ($40,000), its most likely rivals among
European sport coupes. In fact, if you went looking for a heads-up
competitor for the two-door BMW 3-Series _ front-engine,
rear-drive, two-door, manually shifted cars around $35,000 _ you
would find that particular square on the board unoccupied. In goes
the pawn.
</P>
<P>
   Yet BMW offers its customers something more ineffably satisfying
than the right car at the right price. This company has charisma.
It currently dominates big-time endurance racing (BMW won this
year's 24 Hours of Le Mans) and is wading into Formula One next
year _ racing being all about glory and only tangentially about
selling cars. It regularly commissions ``art cars'' painted by the
likes of David Hockney and Jenny Holzer. It blithely spends
millions to build the M Coupe _ a car of inspired homeliness _ just
to give auto writers a hotfoot.
</P>
<P>
   You've got to love attitude like that.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, it's considered bad form, a failure of imagination, for
a car maker merely to lop off the back doors of a sedan to create a
coupe. Witness the Toyota Camry Solara, which puts a lot of
stylistic ground between itself and its four-door sibling. But cars
like the M Coupe effectively inoculate BMW against that charge. The
3-Series coupe confidently mirrors the styling of the sedan. The
windshield is slightly more raked and the car is lower, due in part
to the coupe's standard, half-inch-lower sport suspension. And
while there is no sheet metal shared between sedan and coupe, the
subtle differences are a test of one's observational powers.
</P>
<P>
   As an addition to the BMW canon, the E46 coupe is pretty tame
stuff, nothing like the International-influenced 2000 CS and 3.0 CS
of the 1960s and 1970s. Still, it is a handsome car, taut and
balanced, a wound spring of road-going energy.
</P>
<P>
   Like the sedan, the coupe is available with in-line sixes of
either 2.5 liters and 170 horsepower, or 2.8 liters with 193 horses
(the 323Ci and 328Ci, respectively). Either of these all-aluminum
motors _ equipped with high-tech breathing apparatus like
infinitely variable valve timing _ produce abundant torque with
oily smoothness and a symphonic exhaust note. There is a wonderful
elasticity to these cars. In second gear _ the around-town gear, if
you will _ the car surges as if pulled by a snapping rubber band
from low revs through the redline. The 328Ci offers sparkling
acceleration, with 0-to-60 m.p.h. times of about 6 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   A five-speed manual transmission is standard equipment; but the
coupes are also available with a five-speed automatic with a
``Steptronic'' manual mode. In addition, both coupes and sedans
will come with Dynamic Stability Control, the company's
cornering-stability system, as standard equipment. Traction-control
assisted brakes, generous four-wheel ventilated disks, are also
standard.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the equipment that came with the sedans' optional Sport
package is standard equipment in the coupes. Larger alloy wheels
and tires (16 by 7 inch) are standard; in September, 17-inch tires,
the same as appear on the M3 performance coupe, will be available
as options.
</P>
<P>
   The coupes' suspensions are also borrowed from the sedans' Sport
packages. Firmer springs and shock absorbers at all four corners,
with calibrated increases in anti-roll bars, are standard.
</P>
<P>
   BMW's front-strut, rear multi-link suspensions are unsurpassed.
The moment you put your hands on the three-spoke steering wheel,
you are in instant mind-meld with the car, intuitively aware of its
balance and grip, an intuition that only grows more intimate as you
work the car from one arcing curve to the next. The rigid,
lightweight body, 50-50 weight distribution and communicative
rack-and pinion steering impart the lean athleticism of a quarter
horse. For pure driving pleasure, I think the 3-Series coupe
handily beats out the smaller and faster _ and twitchy _ M
Roadster.
</P>
<P>
   BMW has slathered the coupes with all manner of upgrades,
including the standard multi-function steering wheel encrusted with
buttons that control the audio system and cruise control. It also
comes with fog lights, onboard computer, and Automatic
Recirculation Control, which sniffs the outside air for pollution
and, when it finds it, switches to recirculated air. Multiple smart
air bags and inflatable head restraints, 10-speaker sound system,
keyless entry and security system are also all standard. As well,
much of the equipment formerly available only on top-line models _
on-board navigation, parking-distance alert _ can be bought as
stand-alone options.
</P>
<P>
   It's all good. But at the core of the BMW experience, there is
just a steering wheel, a seat, a gear shift and a motor, bending
and flexing the road ahead. For all its chess-like gamesmanship in
the market, BMW's wisest tactic is to protect the legendary driving
pleasure of its cars. That is the company's most valuable piece on
the board.

 &HT;    Misfits find bittersweet intimacy in dark yet hopeful `Twin
Falls Idaho'
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Blake and Francis Falls know from intimacy. The
way the identical twins limp abreast, whisper in each other's ears
and embrace in sleep like elderly lovers, you would think they were
joined at the hip. You'd be wrong: The brothers are yoked by an
island of stretched, bluish flesh that bridges the young men in
eternal union.
</P>
<P>
   Siamese twins, they share a third leg and the same blood supply,
pumped by individual hearts. That can get bothersome when one of
those hearts is summoned to matters of love.
</P>
<P>
   A queasy, darkly tender love story, ``Twin Falls Idaho'' (in a
titular reach, the Falls brothers reside in a flophouse on Idaho
Avenue) effectively lulls us into its alternate universe of dreamy
squalor and unsettling varieties of human closeness. Real-life
identical twins Mark and Michael Polish, 27, wrote, directed and
star in the film, which, once our morbid curiosity is satisfied,
becomes a moody meditation on intimacy, separation, risk and
dignity. This intensely odd work, ruffled by humor and heartache,
doesn't so much engage as it casts a spell.
</P>
<P>
   We meet the shy twins on their birthday. They have bought
themselves a chocolate cake and hired a prostitute named Penny
(Michele Hicks, she of the green lollipop eyes), who gets over her
initial revulsion with a vigor that leads to attraction. Francis,
the twin on the left, is not well, and Penny takes this as a cue to
place the courtly brothers in her care. They share pasts paved in
maternal rejection and social alienation. This happy little family
of three find common ground in empathy.
</P>
<P>
   The movie begins in a spurt of indie film eccentricity, and
there's the ugly scent of gratuitous exoticism. Yet once the
sour-metal tang of cinema's twin weirdo Davids _ Lynch and
Cronenberg _ dissolves, a seriously affecting story emerges. Before
a backdrop of cruel oglers, vulgar proposals and the comic notion
that Halloween is ``the one night the entire year they're normal,''
Blake and Penny fall in love.
</P>
<P>
   The Polishes handle the relationship discreetly, maturely,
probably because its success hinges on Francis' deterioration. The
young filmmakers, whose long, ashen faces are like dolorous masks,
show a great sense of style and confidence in their debut feature.
They've created a fascinating metaphor for misfits at once
troubling and full of hope.

   MIDEAST-TALKS _ On her first trip to the Middle East since the
Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, came to power, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright hit a snag when the Israelis and
Palestinians failed to deliver an agreement that she hoped to
preside over at a signing ceremony. She met with the Egyptian
president, Hosni Mubarak, who has been urging the Palestinians and
Israelis to agree, and then with the Palestinian leader, Yasser
Arafat. She later left for Tel Aviv. By Jane Perlez.

   KOSOVO-KLA (Pristina, Yugoslavia) _ NATO and U.N. officials have
been enmeshed in complex negotiations with the Kosovo Liberation
Army's leaders over the last few weeks to persuade the 9,000 troops
to demobilize and have come up with a plan to turn the core of the
force into a civilian emergency service. As details are worked out,
the issue remains extremely delicate, not least because of the
implications for Kosovo Albanians' aspiration for independence and
for Yugoslavia's sovereignty over this province. Though NATO sees
the KLA of the future as a civil defense force, the army's officers
inevitably see it as a potential core of a future national army. By
Carlotta Gall. 1,500 words.

   WACO-RENO-FREEH (Washington) _ Janet Reno and Louis Freeh were
once portrayed as one of the capital's perfect power pairings _ a
tough, down-to-earth attorney general who was delighted to have the
earnest former prosecutor and judge as the chief law enforcement
officer by her side. But officials who know them both said the
image never really matched the reality. Disclosures that the FBI
failed to produce information from its files about the use of
inflammable tear gas during the 1993 assault on the Branch Davidian
compound has seriously divided Reno, Freeh and their two agencies.

   NY-MARCH (New York) _ New York City will sharply scale back its
police presence at the Harlem youth rally this year compared to

leaders. The police will deploy only half the number of officers
that were used during last year's event, and the city will not take
several restrictive measures, like shutting down nearby subway
stations. Decision comes after Harlem leaders called for a muted
police response, and federal judges recommended a limited police
presence. By David Barstow.

varieties, is a cross between the princely Pinot and a grape deemed

 &HT;    Workers contaminated at Georgia nuclear site face weeks of tests
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Officials at Savannah River Site in South Carolina
near Augusta on Thursday were trying to determine how seven workers
at the nuclear military complex were contaminated with radioactive
plutonium.
</P>
<P>
   The workers received the radiological contamination Wednesday
while performing a routine procedure in which radioactive material
is processed for long-term storage. Even in relatively small doses,
plutonium can cause organ cancers in humans when ingested.
</P>
<P>
   An alarm indicating airborne radioactivity sounded at 10:55 a.m.
during the operation.
</P>
<P>
   The employees were wearing prescribed protective equipment when
the incident occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Following the alarm, the building, known as the FB Line facility
where nuclear materials are processed and stabilized, was secured,
said Paul Jones, spokesman for Westinghouse Savannah River Co.,
which manages the massive SRS complex for the Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
   There was no external release of radioactivity outside the
facility, and there is no radioactivity hazard to other employees
or the public, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   DOE officials said Thursday they will launch their own
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't known if the radioactive metal entered the workers'
bodies, but tiny particles were found on their clothing and skin.
For the next four to six weeks, the workers must wait for results
of numerous urine and fecal tests that will determine whether they
inhaled or swallowed the metal.
</P>
<P>
   The employees were reassigned Thursday to work in nonradioactive
areas, and the area where the exposure occurred was sealed and
closed until officials determine how the contamination occurred.
</P>
<P>
   SRS officials said that the plant usually has low levels of
radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Contaminations are not uncommon during SRS operations. Fran
Williams, Westinghouse's vice president for environment, safety and
health, said about 60 people each year are found to have
contamination on their clothing after performing radioactive work.

 &HT;    OIL COMPANIES ATTEMPT TO SETTLE FRAUD SUIT
 &HT;    560&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rebuffed by an appeals court, multinational oil
companies are lining up to negotiate settlements of a
multibillion-dollar federal lawsuit that accuses them of defrauding
the government.
</P>
<P>
   By conspiring among themselves to create artificially low
``prices'' for the crude oil they pump from publicly owned land and
offshore zones, the companies cheated taxpayers out of hundreds of
millions of dollars, according to a Justice Department lawsuit
pending in federal court in Lufkin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Chevron Corp., one of the defendants in the
suit, said Thursday the company is involved in ``good faith''
negotiations aimed at settling claims reported to be close to $100
million for its share of the alleged conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can confirm that we are engaged on ongoing royalty
settlement discussions with the government,'' spokeswoman Dawn
Soper said Thursday. ``We do feel that the discussions are
progressing in good faith.''
</P>
<P>
   She declined to say how much Chevron was offering to pay to
avoid fighting the case in court.
</P>
<P>
   Petroleum trade publications reported that another defendant,
Conoco Inc., was negotiating the government's claim of $28 million
against it.
</P>
<P>
   Occidental Petroleum Corp. agreed this week to pay $7.3 million
to resolve its share of the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Michael A. Havard, a Beaumont, Texas, lawyer who originally
filed the lawsuits as a private action, declined to comment on the
settlement discussions by Chevron and Conoco. He said he would move
to drop Occidental from the suit because it had settled.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals refused in July to dismiss
the fraud suit, originally filed in 1996. The suit seeks $5 billion
in damages and penalties.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Mobil Corp. agreed to pay nearly $40 million rather
than fight the charges in court.
</P>
<P>
   Major companies such as Exxon Corp., Texaco Inc., Amoco Corp.,
BP America Inc. and Pennzoil Co. also are defendants in the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, originated by private whistle-blowers who were later
joined by the Justice Department, charges that the companies used a
variety of ``schemes'' to create paper trails of false prices for
the oil they took under federal oil leases, then used those prices
to calculate the royalties due the government.
</P>
<P>
   In one such scheme, the suit charges, two companies will agree
to ``sell'' each other equal amounts of oil at the artificially
depressed prices.
</P>
<P>
   In another purported scheme, a company ``sold'' crude oil to its
own subsidiary, refined it and sold the final product at market
prices. Only the sale between the two corporate entities at the
depressed price was used to calculate royalties, the suit charges.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1986 and 1996, the suit charges, the companies came up
with seven different arrangements for misrepresenting the value of
crude oil taken from public lands and offshore oil lease sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department's Minerals Management Service, which is
responsible for overseeing the production of crude oil under
government leases, has proposed new rules that would make it
impossible for oil companies to understate the royalties they owe.
</P>
<P>
   However, amendments attached to the department's appropriations
in the form of ``riders'' by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas,
have blocked implementation of the new regulations.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The suit exposing the allegedly fraudulent royalty schemes was
filed under the federal False Claims Act, which gives private
citizens the right to sue in the government's behalf if they know
of evidence the taxpayers are being defrauded.
</P>
<P>
   If the suit recovers damages, the private plaintiffs are
entitled to share them with the government. Defendants may be
forced to pay punitive damages, in addition to the amount of the
alleged fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The law was originally passed during the Civil War to deal with
contractors who were allegedly selling moth-eaten blankets and
weevil-infested flour to the Army.
</P>
<P>
   J. Benjamin Johnson Jr. of Plano, Texas, and John M. Martineck
of Carrollton, Texas, both former oil company executives,
originally filed the suits.
</P>
<P>
   The Project on Government Oversight (POGO), a plaintiff in a
subsequent suit, has charged that evaded royalty payments by 18
major oil companies amount to more than $65 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   By company, the annual evaded payments alleged by POGO are:
</P>
<P>
   Shell, $19,459,159
</P>
<P>
   Exxon, $7,993,222

   The suit exposing the allegedly fraudulent royalty schemes was
filed under the federal False Claims Act, which gives private
citizens the right to sue in the government's behalf if they know
of evidence the taxpayers are being defrauded.

   If the suit recovers damages, the private plaintiffs are
entitled to share them with the government. Defendants may be
forced to pay punitive damages, in addition to the amount of the
alleged fraud.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Daughters' dads and bathroom stall tatics.
 &HT;    By Todd C. Duncan
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ So, am I the only the only single father in America
who has to deal with this?
</P>
<P>
   I make sure my 6-year-old daughter goes before we leave the
house. We arrive at the theater, load up on popcorn, soda and
little candy bears. We find the two best seats in the house and
await the next Jim Henson spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just when Miss Piggy is about to eat up a scene: ``Daddy,
I have to go!''
</P>
<P>
   We scramble out of the dark theater and race to the bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The line to use the ladies' room snakes around the corner, but
that's not our destination. We rush into the men's room, find a
stall and ensure cleanliness, and then I leave her alone to
complete the mission.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, such trips have drawn the ire and shock of some of the
men's room customers. Not the little boys, however _ they're too
busy concentrating on target management. It's adult men who are
freaking out.
</P>
<P>
   One man in his 40s said, ``Hey, this is a men's room.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking low enough so my daughter can't hear my selection of
juicy words, I proceed to tell the man of my fatherly
responsibility and question his desire to condemn my actions. After
a few minutes, he apologizes and admits he was wrong to question my
parental acumen.
</P>
<P>
   What did he think was going to happen?
</P>
<P>
   The fact that a man would even think of something ``going
wrong,'' as one man said to me, is so perverse. What does he mean
by ``going wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   My daughter is a small child. She is blind to any sexual
overtones and there shouldn't be any in the bathroom anyway. The
little boys she quickly passes on the way to an unused stall are
not at all disturbed by her presence.
</P>
<P>
   Why are some men, and maybe some women, so put off by such a
simple action?
</P>
<P>
   We as a community don't even look twice when a mother takes her
6-year-old son into the ladies' room. Now, it's true that women
complete their missions behind closed doors, but why are they given
the benefit of the doubt as caretakers and dads aren't? My
intentions to care for my child are no different.
</P>
<P>
   When I was growing up, it was true that friendly men and women
would help single parents by offering to usher the boys or girls to
their respective bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The sad reality is that in today's climate, when horrible acts
of cruelty are committed against children every day, I cannot risk
a stranger taking my child anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   I once let a young woman take my daughter into the restroom of a
store. I waited just outside the door, listening for the slightest
sound of distress or trouble. It was the longest and most
nerve-racking four minutes of my life. Nothing happened, but if
something had occurred, I would have never forgiven myself.
</P>
<P>
   Should my need to protect my daughter subject me to suspicion
and condemnation? I think not.
</P>
<P>
   I know that my daughter soon will start seeking and be granted
total bathroom independence.
</P>
<P>
   We have discussed what to do if a stranger says or does
something she feels is not right almost as many times as I've read
Winnie the Pooh adventures to her at bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   She'll fly solo very soon, and I won't have to deal with
uptight, nosy male jerks. But why did I ever have to?
</P>
<P>
   It's funny, we see commercials and newspapers ads every day in
this country that slam men for not taking an active role in their
children's lives. Do whatever it takes to protect and nurture your
child, the messages bellow.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that what dads like me have been doing?

 &HT;    MIDEAST PLAYERS AFFIRM NEW WYE, KEEP PROCESS ON TRACK
 &HT;    525&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Egypt _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's
arrival in the Middle East suffered a setback Thursday with the
failure of Israeli and Palestinian negotiators to agree on a
reworking of the Wye River peace plan.
</P>
<P>
   She had hoped her trip could focus on larger issues of regional
peace, such as the status of Jerusalem and attempts to restart
talks between Israel and Syria. But, she found herself again mired
in the kind of peace process details she hoped to avoid with new
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday night, Albright hustled to broker an agreement.
She met with Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat here in
Alexandria, where he had come in case there would be a peace
agreement to sign. Then, she headed to Jerusalem for after-midnight
talks with Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month Albright postponed a visit in order to avoid
getting pulled back into the minutia of Palestinian-Israeli
dealmaking. This time, officials had hoped she could kick off the
trip with a signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day trip to the Middle East is intended to capitalize
on momentum from the May election of Barak, who has promised to
move quickly in reaching a final peace with the Palestinians, the
Syrians and the Lebanese. Arafat and Syrian President Hafez Assad
have indicated they are eager, in return, to settle issues with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday evening, the Israeli and Palestinian flags on hand
for use in an anticipated joint press conference here had been
deposited near a rolled-up carpet in a side hallway of the ornate
Ras It-Teen(CQ) Palace, where the signing was planned. A grand
salon overlooking the Mediterranean Sea had been prepared and hours
earlier workers had been dusting off the desk intended for the
signing.
</P>
<P>
   After the non-signing and a meeting with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, Albright talked about the obstacles and
opportunities facing her trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the road to true peace remains hard and uphill,'' she
said. ``The opportunity now to reach important new agreements has
been a long time in coming, but it is has arrived and we must seize
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian Foreign Minister Amre Moussa said he still hoped a deal
could be reached ``within hours or days.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wye River Memorandum, signed last October, was itself a
refinement of the 1993 Oslo peace plan, in which Israel was
supposed to withdraw from lands conquered from the Arabs in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Moussa said an agreement on the Wye implementation is necessary
for a political climate that had been ``very much poisoned'' by the
stalling of the Oslo process.
</P>
<P>
   Albright acknowledged also that progress in the
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations could affect the chances of
starting talks between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Most political analysts believe a breakthrough with the
Palestinians would increase the pressure on Syria's Assad to make
peace with Israel. The theory is that he would be afraid Israelis
might not feel the need to offer as much to Syria once they feel
secure on their border with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Albright is scheduled to visit Damascus Saturday, and her trip
would be boosted with an agreement on the Wye implementation before
then.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Over the diplomatic protests of U.S. officials, Barak's
predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu placed Wye on hold in January,
saying the Palestinians had not done enough to stop terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Barak campaigned against Netanyahu with promises to get Wye back
on track, but upon taking office he insisted on renegotiating it.
</P>
<P>
   A major issue in dispute concerns the release of Palestinian
prisoners from Israeli jails. Israel refuses to release those who
committed murders, but Palestinians see them as prisoners of a war
that is now ending.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides were reportedly differing just slightly, with
Israel offering to release 370 prisoners and the Palestinians
asking for 400, down from 650 originally.
</P>
<P>
   Also in contention were timetables for further Israeli troop
withdrawals from occupied Arab areas.
</P>
<P>
   Barak wanted to slow down the withdrawals and link them to
discussions of the largest issues still between the two sides.
Those so-called ``permanent status'' issues include whether Israel
will share Jerusalem with the Palestinians, remove enclaves of
Jewish settlers from the West Bank or allow the return of any
Palestinian refugees to their old lands in Israel.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the last 20 years or so, there were only two choices among
luxury touring bikes: the Harley-Davidson Electra Glide or the
Honda Gold Wing. Both are very good long-distance bikes, and both
are made in America. These are motorcycles that come with AM/FM
radios, CB radios, tape players and cigarette lighters, in addition
to a large, powerful engine, the traditional windshield, saddle
bags, cargo box and plenty of cushy seat room for two. They are,
essentially, two-wheeled cars.
</P>
<P>
   Now BMW has created the K1200LT, the new absolute ruler of the
touring bike class. It is not simply a two-wheeled car, but a
two-wheeled BMW 740iL.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath the wind-tunnel-tested bodywork is a
1200-cubic-centimeter inline-four engine, a five-speed overdrive
transmission, shaft drive and BMW's patented Telelever front and
Paralever rear suspension systems, mechanical guts shared by all of
the company's K-series motorcycles. The engine makes 100
horsepower, more than any other in the class, and 85 foot-pounds of
torque. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The $18,900 Custom comes with windshield, fairing, luggage, side
bumpers, antilock brakes, electronic cruise control, electric
reverse, an AM/FM cassette system with four speakers and two remote
controls.
</P>
<P>
   It also has two 12-volt outlets, a digital clock, electrically
heated hand grips, a four-function on-board computer, the first
six-CD changer ever offered on a motorcycle, and the first heated
seat system for motorcycles (front and rear seats heat
individually, with two ranges per seat).
</P>
<P>
   The Comfort Seat adds an extra inch of foam cushion, and the
chrome package adds brightwork to footrests, rub strips, windshield
housing, mirrors and centerstand handle.
</P>
<P>
   The less well equipped Standard sells for $16,900, and the
middle Icon model for $17,900. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first few minutes with the K1200LT Custom simply reinforce
the initial impression: Boy, is this thing big! It is almost 99
inches long, 42 inches wide at the mirrors, with a 64-inch
wheelbase. But once my passenger and I sat down on the plush
saddle, grabbed the substantial handlebar grips, eased up the side
stand and planted our feet on the ground, the Big K felt just
right. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although it weighs more than 800 pounds (plus my own 220 and my
riding partner's 120), it moves off smartly, and the engine revs
easily to 7,000 rpm's. With electronic fuel injection and
electronic ignition, it springs to life easily on cold mornings and
is ready to go instantly. The engine is a horizontal in-line four,
rubber-mounted to combat vibration. We found the clutch a bit
clunky, but the engine was smooth, free-revving and powerful, even
with two on board plus luggage.
</P>
<P>
   The big surprise with the K1200LT was its handling ease and
cornering precision. This big bike will lean way, way over and cut
through curves and corners like a much smaller, lighter bike, then
stand up and motor away with no fuss. The suspension just laughs at
potholes and frost heaves. The brakes are large Brembo triple
disks, two front and one rear, with enormous stopping power and the
added benefit of the antilock function for motorcycles pioneered by
BMW, which is very useful for riding on slick surfaces. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This bike is nothing if not flexibile. You can adjust the
rider's seat height, the passenger backrest position, the headlamp
height, the clutch and brake levers, and the front and rear
suspension. Even the windshield height is electrically adjustable
through a range of four inches. Add to that the thumb-flick
adjustment of the cruise control, sound system volume and program.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We tried the four-speaker sound system on radio, cassette and CD
changer, and it all worked very well indeed, with good clarity and
power at highway cruising speeds. The large, tank-mounted buttons
for the system offer bass, treble, fade, balance, six-station
memory, seek, scan, tape and disk. There is a lighted digital
display for the Radio Data System, which shows the call letters and
programming of radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   There is enough lockable storage on this bike to accommodate
most couples for a long weekend, although the CD changer steals
room from the right-side saddle bag. BMW offers optional soft
luggage made to fit inside the bags, making it easier to unload at
your destination. The rear box contains a vanity mirror, a lamp and
a compartment for documents; the tank has another storage space
that houses the cassette deck and a flashlight, with room for
sunglasses and toll money.

BEATLES' `YELLOW SUBMARINE' WAS AN ANIMATED   VOYAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It has become a rite of autumn, as much as falling
leaves, shortened days and post-Labor Day Christmas displays.
</P>
<P>
   New Beatles product will soon be arriving in stores, just in
time to make the Christmas gift-giving season seem truly fab. In
recent years, we've seen the vaults raided for archival albums like
``The Beatles Live at the BBC'' and the ``Anthology'' series, as
well as special packaging efforts that have returned classics like
``The Beatles'' (White Album) to their original form (albeit a tad
smaller).
</P>
<P>
   This year's offerings will be a feast for the eyes as well as
the ears, as MGM has restored the Beatles' psychedelic celebration
of love, love, love, ``Yellow Submarine,'' for video and DVD.
Capitol Records will release a complementary ``songtrack'' album
that, for the first time, includes all 15 songs heard in the film.
And there will be the obligatory array of Beatles merchandise,
ranging from ``Yellow Submarine'' cookie jars and action figures to
a commemorative stamp from the U.S. Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   ```Yellow Submarine' is a living, breathing example of what the
Beatles were saying and believing in the late '60s, namely that
love is all you need,'' says rock journalist Bill Flanagan, who, as
editorial director for cable music channel VH1, has put together a
``Yellow Submarine'' special that will air on Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie touches into that part of the '60s counterculture
that was trying to preserve a youthful innocence,'' Flanagan
continues. ``Much of the counterculture seemed X-rated, but, at the
same time, there was a tremendous nostalgia for childhood. That
probably had a lot to do with the war and the draft and the fact
that when you turned 18, you were in danger of being shipped off to
the jungle and shot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yellow Submarine'' was an unlikely artistic and commercial
triumph. The animated film was made in less than a year for a
paltry $1 million. (By way of comparison, Disney these days
typically spends four years and more than $100 million on its
animated movies.)
</P>
<P>
   And the Beatles themselves wanted nothing to do with the movie,
reluctantly contributing only four new songs that were more or less
throwaways. (Albeit Beatles throwaways, i.e. minor classics.)
``It'll do for the film,'' John Lennon would say of a song that
didn't live up to the group's lofty standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't want to invest the time to make another movie,''
says Bruce Markoe, the MGM executive who spearheaded the ``Yellow
Submarine'' restoration. ``But they owed United Artists one more
movie, and they figured this was the easiest way to fulfill their
obligation.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after making two movies with Richard Lester _ the
classic ``Hard Day's Night'' in 1964 and its follow-up, ``Help!''
the following year _ the Beatles struggled to find the time and the
inclination to go before the cameras again. At one point, it was
announced they would make a western titled ``A Talent for Loving.''
That was scratched in June 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea, ``Shades of Personality,'' had John Lennon playing
a man with three different personalities other than his own. (Talk
about ``Mind Games.'') Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo
Starr, naturally, would play the multiple manifestations. Michael
Antonioni, coming off his acclaimed ``Blow-Up,'' would direct.
Sadly, the timing was off. The Beatles started their own company,
Apple, and made, gulp, ``Magical Mystery Tour'' instead.
</P>
<P>
   Other concepts: Remaking ``The Three Musketeers'' with Lester
(who later went on to make the movie _ and its two sequels _ with
Richard Chamberlain, Oliver Reed and Michael York) and a gay-themed
film that the group ultimately vetoed. ``It wasn't that we were
anti-gay,'' Paul McCartney said at the time. ``It's just that we,
the Beatles, weren't gay.''
</P>
<P>
   King Features, who was making a Saturday morning Beatles cartoon
series for ABC-TV, approached the Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein,
with the idea of making an animated movie based on a Beatles song.
The band agreed _ as long as they didn't have to provide their own
voices. Actors were hired, not that anyone noticed the difference.
Many reviews of the film erroneously praised the Beatles for their
vocal work.
</P>
<P>
   King Features subcontracted the animation to Britain's TVC
(Television Cartoons). Four writers (including Erich Segal of
``Love Story'' fame) are credited with the screenplay, which finds
the cartoon Beatles sailing the sea of green to help liberate
Pepperland from the gloomy Blue Meanies, an evil bunch of baddies
who suck the color out of people and whack them on the heads with
apples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yellow Submarine'' was the first animated feature made in
Britain in 14 years. Work began in 1967; the film premiered on July
17, 1968, in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the animation is very creative and ground-breaking,
and some of the work is very bad,'' says MGM's Markoe. ``They just
didn't have the time or the money to make everything perfect,
which, I think, is part of the movie's charm. And when you look
back on the kinds of movies that were being made in 1968, `Yellow
Submarine' comes off incredibly fresh and innovative.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough. The five films nominated for the best picture Oscar
in 1968 _ ``Oliver!'' ``Funny Girl,'' ``Rachel, Rachel,'' ``Romeo
and Juliet'' and ``The Lion in Winter'' _ reflected the tastes of
an aging Hollywood power establishment increasingly out of touch
with younger audiences. ``Yellow Submarine,'' with its vivid
colors, exhilarating animation and make-believe worlds seemed, by
comparison, a revolutionary work of imagination. The movie made
year-end Top 10 lists in Time, Newsweek and most major newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The newly renovated version of the film (which will play for a
week in a few art house theaters, including the Nuart in Los
Angeles) digitally restores the first 40 minutes of the film,
bringing back faded colors to their full psychedelic intensity.
(``A lot of people think you have to be on drugs to watch the
movie,'' Markoe says. ``Maybe that was true at one time, but times
certainly have changed.'')
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference in the new print, however, is heard, not
seen. The songs have been remastered, giving them bigger, cleaner
mixes that isolate individual instruments in a glorious wrap-around
sound. The film's sound design has been digitally enhanced, and the
sound effects now perfectly match the wild visual landscapes on the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   The movie also reinstates an animated sequence featuring the
Beatles' ``Hey Bulldog,'' footage that was cut from the American
version and many British prints. (``Paul McCartney was rumored not
to like it,'' Markoe says.) An unreleased video of the Beatles
recording the song will be shown throughout the month on VH1.
</P>
<P>
   The success of ``Yellow Submarine'' helped many careers,
including one person who had nothing to do with the movie. American
pop artist Peter Max was frequently credited with the art
direction, and he did little to dispel the myth, often allowing
interviewers to incorrectly identify him as the movie's designer.
He was said to be honored by the mistake. (Talk about a Blue
Meanie.) Czech designer Heinz Edelmann actually did all the work.
</P>
<P>
   Modern animators like ``South Park'' creators Trey Parker and
Matt Stone and John Lasseter of ``Toy Story'' cite ``Yellow
Submarine'' as highly influential, Lasseter going so far as to
introduce it as his favorite movie at a recent film festival in San
Francisco. The surviving Beatles themselves now embrace the movie
and fully approve the newly restored film and its ``songtrack''
companion album.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, with the way the culture and the government are
now, it's all still happening now as it was in `Yellow
Submarine,''' George Harrison told Billboard editor Timothy White
in a recent interview. ``Except the Blue Meanies have got a bigger
stranglehold on the planet right now than they had back in '67.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the timing for the Beatles is _ as it always seems to be
_ perfect. &UR;  &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARIPADA, India _ All that awful morning, in the eternity of a
few hours, people gathered at the old yellow house to be near her
and to pray. By 7, the crowd had spilled out the front door and
onto the portico and then into the yard under the mango trees.
</P>
<P>
   Something terrible had happened _ but to whom? Gladys Staines
had not heard from her husband, Graham, a respected missionary, or
their two sons, Philip, 10, and Timothy, 6. They were at a
religious retreat in a village four hours away. Had they been the
ones killed by an anti-Christian mob, the ones burned beyond
recognition in a jeep?
</P>
<P>
   By 9:30, it was settled, the hesitantly feared now the
irrevocably tragic. What was there to say at such a moment? Mrs.
Staines, according to those there, shook with grief and, for a
time, moved very slowly as if she was struggling to part her way
through the air.
</P>
<P>
   She seemed to be impaled in the middle of a thought, which
finally, with quavering voice, she shared. ``Whoever did this, we
will forgive them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment _ that example of her living faith _ has been
widely praised in India, a nation often rent with religion-based
violence, most frequently between Hindus and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Court Judge D.P. Wadhwa, head of an inquiry into the
deaths, which occurred in January, and their link to a wider
outbreak of anti-Christian attacks, commended Mrs. Staines. ``By
her conduct, she has put to shame, if they have any shame, not only
the perpetrators of the crime but all those who directly or
indirectly may have sympathy for them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gladys Staines, 48, returned last month from a respite in her
native Australia. She has decided to carry on her husband's work,
running a home for leprosy patients here in Baripada, a dusty,
traffic-clogged city of 25,000 in the eastern state of Orissa. She
will continue to tell people the ``good news'' as she confidently
calls it, that the blood of Jesus, God's son, can cleanse the world
of sin, and that God is fair and just and that divine purpose
exists in all that goes on, even if those purposes are at times
elusive.
</P>
<P>
   She has yet to fathom why God has taken her sons and husband.
Questions leap into her mind _ a tumble of thoughts _ but she tries
to set them aside rather than pursue answers. ``I ask myself, do I
dwell on the type of death they had?'' she said. ``There are so
many gray areas that no one knows: Were they killed first or burned
alive? I don't know. There were just three lots of bones found in
the jeep, though I'm told a bit of flesh was left on my husband.
Regardless of how they died, they aren't here and won't ever be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question goes through my mind: Am I angry? Am I not? I
don't know. I cope by not allowing myself to do much thinking. At
times, I become overcome with sadness. They're not here. I can't
play with my boys. Day by day, I start with the Bible, reading the
prayers. Previously, I could talk to my husband before going to
bed. Now I talk to God, pour out my heart to him and he gives me
the strength and wisdom to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham and Gladys Staines, both raised on dairy farms near
Brisbane, were never among life's spiritual hobos, off on some long
search for what to believe in. He was brought up in the Baptist
church, she in the Church of the Brethren. They were infused with
God and untroubled by doubt. They wanted to be missionaries and
spread their certitude.
</P>
<P>
   They met in India. Staines was 10 years older. When Gladys, a
nurse, made a trip to Orissa with a church group, he was already
there, not only looking after the leprosy home in Baripada but also
traveling village to village, handing out religious tracts and
showing film strips. He would woo her by mail.
</P>
<P>
   The Baripada area is home to thousands of Santhals, a tribal
people whose animist beliefs traditionally include idols and evil
spirits. The Staineses wanted to tell them about Jesus and his
great gift of redemption and the terrible consequences for those
who do not accept Christ as their personal savior.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the good news, isn't it, that there is forgiveness for
every sin through the vessel of Jesus Christ,'' Mrs. Staines said.
``He died on the cross for us, and that's why missionaries go all
over the earth, so people will know they have a choice. If you
don't go to heaven, you go to hell, and that is the essence of the
Christian message.''
</P>
<P>
   She is a tall woman, comfortable in saris. Tinted glasses help
her navigate through the sunshine. Of those who murdered her
husband and boys she said: ``I can forgive their deeds, but I
cannot forgive their sins. Only Jesus can forgive their sins. And
they will have to ask.''
</P>
<P>
   On the night of Jan. 22, Staines and his sons were sleeping in
their jeep. He had been identified as someone involved in
conversions, witnesses say. More than 30 men attacked the vehicle
with sticks and clubs. They refused to let even the small,
screaming boys escape. Straw was stuffed through smashed windows
and packed beneath. The fire quickly became an inferno. The mob
stayed to watch their victims die.
</P>
<P>
   There have been several arrests, but the alleged leader of the
group, a notorious Hindu militant named Dara Singh, has yet to be
captured. On Aug. 26, he killed again, the police say, leading a
mob that chopped off a Muslim's arms before setting him on fire.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of the Staineses came amid a spate of attacks
against Christians and it led to a burst of national introspection.
Many in India said the Bharatiya Janata Party _ the Hindu
nationalists who then headed the governing coalition _ were
responsible for creating a climate of religious intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Dara Singh was said to belong to the Bajrang Dal, a group
associated with the BJP.
</P>
<P>
   But the Wadhwa Commission report, publicly issued on Aug. 6,
found that Singh was not acting at the behest of any political
organization. This conclusion has been condemned by many as a
whitewash that ignores contrary evidence. The killings are now an
issue in the current round of elections. Christians make up 2.3
percent of the population. Many of their leaders have urged a vote
against any party with a religious agenda.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Mrs. Staines has resisted the political uses of
her tragedy. She has yet to read the 250-page report. ``Life has to
go on,'' she said. ``The work has to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   The leprosy home is a cluster of modest buildings on forested
land. She moves easily among the patients, many of them socially
ostracized, cast out because of their ugly skin lesions and
deadened limbs and missing toes and fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the patients had doggedly walked from this refuge to the
cemetery, joining the thousands who attended the Staineses'
funeral. Gladys Staines and her 13-year-old daughter, Esther, the
family's two survivors, faced the throng and sang a favorite hymn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he lives, I can face tomorrow,'' the words go.
``Because he lives, all fear is gone.''

FORD MAKES IT OFFICIAL, AUGUST WAS THE BEST EVER FOR U.S. AUTO
SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: A graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

(DW) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Ford Motor Co. said Thursday that its sales in August
were even higher than expected, making last month the best August
ever for auto sales in the United States and the best month in the
1990s after adjusting for seasonal variations in demand.
</P>
<P>
   Ford posted an 8.1 percent increase in sales compared with those
in the period a year earlier. Car sales leaped 19.2 percent with
the introduction of new models and the purchase of Volvo's car
business. Sales of light trucks _ sport utility vehicles, pickup
trucks and minivans _ climbed seven-tenths of a percent.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in light-truck sales was particularly surprising
because Ford had sold an extraordinary number of light trucks in
August 1998, when a 54-day strike against General Motors Corp. had
just concluded and had left GM dealerships with few light trucks
left on their lots.
</P>
<P>
   Ward's Auto Info Bank, a market research service in Southfield,
Mich., calculated that the seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales
in August was 17.76 million cars and light trucks. That made August
sales the fourth-highest ever in seasonally adjusted terms, only
trailing September 1986, September 1985 and December 1986. The
expiration in the mid-1980s of tax deductions for certain car loan
expenses produced a brief but unsustainable spike in sales.
</P>
<P>
   August is traditionally a slow month in the auto industry. The
actual number of automobiles sold in August this year was fewer
than in May or June, but the seasonal adjustments for the May and
June sales made those numbers look weaker than last month's sales.
</P>
<P>
   Auto executives attribute the brisk sales to rising household
incomes, soaring stock and real estate prices, low unemployment,
extremely strong consumer confidence, fairly flat prices for new
automobiles and the introduction of innovative vehicles like the
Lexus RX-300, which is a cross between a car and a sport utility
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Some auto analysts have expressed concern that rebates and other
incentives may be contributing considerably to the boom in sales.
But that view is beginning to shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm beginning to believe there's something more structural
going on,'' as rising incomes outpace increases in vehicle prices,
making automobiles more affordable, said John Casesa, an auto
analyst at Merrill Lynch. ``I don't get the impression incentives
changed a lot from July to August.''
</P>
<P>
   The Autofacts Group of PricewaterhouseCoopers, which tracks
industry incentives, has not yet compiled August figures; in July,
incentives were 24 percent higher than in the month a year earlier,
but there were unusually few incentives in July 1998 because of the
GM strike. Incentives in July of this year were up only 1.5 percent
from June.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest section of the market in August was sport utility
vehicles, prompting executives to predict that the off-road
automobiles would remain popular. ``Consumer demand for SUV's has
outpaced every other segment every year of this decade, and we
believe this trend will continue,'' said Robert Rewey, Ford's group
vice president for marketing, sales and service.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition in March of Volvo Cars accounted for less than
half of Ford's improvement in car sales. Even without the
acquisition, Ford's car sales rose 12.6 percent compared with those
in the month a year earlier. The introduction of the Lincoln LS and
Jaguar S-Type sports sedans this summer and the earlier
introduction of the completely redesigned Mercury Cougar have
helped Ford, as have lower prices on the Ford Taurus and Mercury
Sable sedans.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler, GM, Toyota, Honda, Volkswagen and several
smaller auto makers all announced robust August sales on Wednesday,
while only Nissan posted slightly lower sales. GM's market share in
August was 29.8 percent, barely falling short of the company's goal
of a minimum of 30 percent but nonetheless a slight improvement
from recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, BMW &UR;  &LR; said that, like Ford, it had enjoyed its best
August ever. BMW's sales jumped 31.5 percent compared with those in
the month a year earlier.

KOREAN POWER COMPANY MOVES TOWARD PRIVATIZATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SAMUEL LEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ South Korea took a big step Thursday toward
opening up its state-run power generation industry to foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
   The state-owned Korea Electric Power Corp., or KEPCO, the only
company in the nation involved in power generation, said it would
spin off six independent companies in November, the company's first
concrete move toward privatization in its 38-year history. Later
this month, the government will offer the six companies for sale to
both foreign and domestic buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``KEPCO will allot 42 power-generation facilities, either
currently in operation or under construction, to five hydro- and
thermoelectric power companies,'' Lee Hyung-chul, director of
restructuring at the utility, said. ``Nuclear power plants will be
separated into a single subsidiary.''
</P>
<P>
   Korea Electric will then transfer 16,000 of its workers, or 46
percent, to the individual companies. It will also transfer to the
companies 34 trillion won, or $28.7 billion, of its 62 trillion won
in total assets, as well as $14.8 billion of its $27 billion in
total debt, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   However, sales of assets to foreign buyers will not occur until
next year at the earliest, said Lee Ki-ho, a director of the
Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy. ``It's not like selling
individual pencils from a pack,'' he said, noting the complex and
time-consuming process involved in such asset sales.
</P>
<P>
   Although no foreign company has officially notified Korea
Electric of its intentions to buy assets, Lee said industry giants
had expressed interest, including the state-owned utility EDF in
France, Enron of the United States and AES of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Opening up the power-generation market will break a decades-old
monopoly in the utility industry here, Lee said. Beginning next
year, private companies, both foreign and domestic, will be allowed
to build power plants in Korea, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the labor union representing Korea Electric's workers, which
demonstrated against the plan earlier this year in its first
protest ever, said such changes would hurt Korean industries and
households.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just a matter of job security,'' said Kim Chae-ro,
a representative of the union. ``Resolving KEPCO's debts through
asset sales will destroy the company. The changes will lead to an
industry where suppliers wield the sword.''

POLITICAL PRESSURE BUILDS AS RENO FENDS OFF GOP CALL FOR
RESIGNATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Partisan rhetoric for and against Attorney General
Janet Reno escalated Thursday on Capitol Hill amid increasing
evidence that FBI agents used incendiary gas canisters when they
raided the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Republican Fred Thompson of Tennessee joined two
Texas lawmakers who earlier suggested that Reno resign. The GOP
legislators called Reno's competence into question, saying she
should have known six years ago that the FBI, an agency within her
Justice Department, might have used flammable devices in the siege.
</P>
<P>
   The Texans, Sen. Phil Gramm and Rep. Pete Sessions of Dallas, on
Tuesday said the attorney general's credibility has been destroyed
in light of her six years of denying that federal lawmen used
pyrotechnic equipment during the raid on Mount Carmel. The FBI last
week contradicted Reno in acknowledging that agents might have used
the devices on a Branch Davidian facility away from the main
compound.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas defended Reno's
vow to ``get to the truth'' about whether FBI use of pyrotechnic
equipment contributed to the inferno.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, through a spokesman, said she had no plans to resign. Last
week, conceding her credibility was in question, she called for an
investigation of the siege to be conducted by someone with no ties
to the department.
</P>
<P>
   The White House deflected calls for Reno's resignation Thursday
and endorsed the selection of an independent investigator.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has confidence that the attorney general and the
Department of Justice will get to the bottom of this,'' said
Clinton spokesman Jake Siewart. ``She's promised to do that, and
she's promised to do it in a way that is full and as timely as is
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Siewart added that Clinton is ``deeply concerned that the
attorney general appears to have been misled and may have been lied
to'' about what munitions the FBI used.
</P>
<P>
   The partisan flare-up followed the U.S. marshals' seizure
Wednesday, under Reno's order, of a previously undisclosed
videotape from the FBI. The Justice Department said the tape, made
by an aircraft flying over the site, might shed light on whether
FBI agents used flammable gas canisters and if that use helped
start the deadly fire that engulfed the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Reno last week acknowledged that FBI agents might have used some
flammable military gas canisters to penetrate the roof of an
underground bunker away from the main Branch Davidian building. But
she said she continues to believe their use did not contribute to
the inferno.
</P>
<P>
   At least 75 cult members, including leader David Koresh, were
killed by gunfire and the fire that erupted during the raid. An
earlier federal investigation, which Reno endorsed, concluded that
some Branch Davidians shot fellow members and deliberately set the
fires during the siege.
</P>
<P>
   But Thompson, an outspoken Reno critic who has assailed the
attorney general's handling of alleged Clinton campaign
irregularities, said the earlier report cannot be believed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This last week at the Justice Department has a familiar ring
to it: proof of information withheld from Congress and the American
people; an inadequate internal investigation and an attorney
general unaware of what is going on in her own department,''
Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm and Sessions were more direct, calling for Reno to step
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorney general told Congress (in 1993) that she would
take responsibility for the events at Waco,'' Gramm said. ``Now she
says she didn't know what happened, and she wants an investigation.
If the attorney general cannot manage to find and tell the truth
about a matter as important as the Waco incident, she should step
aside and give someone else a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Sessions, echoing Gramm, said Reno ``has not acted properly.''
He added, ``I and other members of Congress ... are concerned about
how the investigation has been handled and why evidence is
apparently being withheld from congressional investigators and the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson Lee, a vocal supporter of Reno, assailed her
Republican colleagues for rushing to condemn the attorney general
before an investigation has been completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need not, in hysteria, immediately ask for heads to roll,''
Jackson Lee said. ``She (Reno) has the integrity to respond on her
own without members of Congress calling for her resignation.''
</P>
<P>
   Also supporting Reno, liberal Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of
Vermont accepted the attorney general's pledge that she would ``get
to the truth'' of what munitions FBI agents used in storming the
cult's Mount Carmel compound.
</P>

   ``She clearly is troubled by the fact that relevant information
was kept from her before, and she is determined not to let that
happen again,'' Leahy said. ``I continue to believe that an
independent investigation is far preferable to the FBI
investigating itself in this case, and I welcome indications that
General Reno agrees.''

IN ANOTHER ANTI-CHRISTIAN INCIDENT IN INDIA, MOB KILLS A CATHOLIC
PRIEST 
</HEADLINE>

(DW) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI _ A Roman Catholic priest, asleep in a remote eastern
hamlet where he had been counseling the poor, was slain by a mob
early Thursday morning, cut down by bows and arrows as he tried to
escape an attack, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The killing was in Jamabani, a village in Orissa, not far from
where a Christian missionary and his two sons were killed in
January. Few details were known about the new incident as
authorities from the district capital, Baripada, had to travel a
long distance through rough terrain to go to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The priest, who used the single name Aruldoss, made weekly
visits to the village from his church in Anandapur, said a fellow
priest, the Rev. Jose Thundiyl. The journey required a 20-mile ride
on a motor scooter followed by a 12-mile hike.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had been in our diocese for five years, and he was a very
good missionary,'' Thundiyl said. ``He led a simple life. All the
time he wanted to be with the poor. His interest was not in
conversions. It was in organizing poor people so they knew their
rights, so they knew how to live their lives better.''
</P>
<P>
   A companion of the priest fled from the attackers. His statement
to the police said 15 or 20 men set upon them at 2 a.m., the Press
Trust of India reported. Aruldoss was felled by arrows as he ran
away, and he was then beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the attackers' identities nor their motive was known.
The president of the Conference of Catholic Bishops of India,
Archbishop Henry D'Souza of Calcutta, blamed a hate campaign by
Hindu extremists. ``The poor priest and his associate,'' D'Souza
said, ``seem to have been attacked for the only reason that they
are Christians.''

 &HT;    CLINTON BACKS RENO AS PROBE DECISION NEARS
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno got the backing of
President Clinton on Thursday as she prepared to announce an
outside investigation of how information contradicting the FBI's
account of the 1993 Branch Davidian assault remained undisclosed
during six years of public and private probes.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jake Siewert said the president was
``deeply concerned that the attorney general appears to have been
misled and may have been lied to'' about the use of flammable tear
gas canisters during the assault near Waco, Texas, which ended in
the deaths of sect leader David Koresh and scores of his followers.
</P>
<P>
   Siewert said the president, who has often been at odds with Reno
over independent investigations, including one that led to his own
impeachment, ``has confidence that the attorney general and the
Department of Justice will get to the bottom of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from the White House and Congress, which has
conducted extensive investigations of its own into the tragedy,
Reno is reportedly searching for an outside investigator to look
into the matter.
</P>
<P>
   An informal list of about half a dozen names has been circulated
at the Justice Department this week. It includes two former
Republican senators noted for their bipartisanship, Warren Rudman
of New Hampshire and John C. Danforth of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The White House vote of confidence in Reno came hours after U.S.
marshals impounded infrared tapes recorded by the FBI early on
April 19, 1993, the day the federal government's 51-day siege of
the Davidian compound came to a fiery end.
</P>
<P>
   The tape, which the Justice Department released Thursday,
includes an audio track on which an FBI commander can be heard
granting permission to use ``military rounds'' to ``penetrate the
construction project,'' a concrete bunker that was located about 50
yards from Koresh's compound.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``military rounds'' referred to the flammable tear-gas
grenades.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly seven hours after the grenades were fired, the largely
wooden compound erupted in flames. Koresh, his followers and 21
children perished during the inferno. Some of the 79 who died were
the victims of gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has long maintained that the fires in the wooden
compound were started by the Davidians themselves. Byron Sage, a
retired FBI supervisor who was the agency's chief negotiator with
Koresh during the standoff, noted Thursday that the infrared tape
confirms that the incendiary rounds were not directed toward the
wooden structure.
</P>
<P>
   But the FBI has also long denied that it used combustible
tear-gas canisters in the assault at the compound.
</P>
<P>
   The tape released Thursday is the second piece of recently
discovered evidence contradicting the FBI's six-year denial. An
internal FBI memo disclosed last week referred to use of the
flammable canisters. The memo had been in the files of the FBI's
general counsel since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The tape was located in the files of the FBI's hostage rescue
team at Quantico, Va., and transferred to the FBI headquarters,
where it was impounded by U.S. marshals working for the Justice
Department on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Siewert said the marshals's actions were appropriate in order to
``protect the integrity of this material'' _ an admission that
underscored the increasing preference to turn over the
investigation to a private citizen rather than leave it to the FBI
and the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``An independent investigation is far preferable to the FBI
investigating itself in this case,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy of
Vermont, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee,
which has oversight responsibility for the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, the chairman of the Judiciary
subcommittee that specifically monitors the FBI, said the spectacle
of federal marshals seizing evidence from the FBI underscored the
``cowboy culture'' of the agency, which is largely independent from
the rest of the executive branch of the government.

 By LINDA CONLEY   The Herald-Journal, Spartanburg, S.C.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Rev. G.H. Williams is more than a guide on the
tour of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s home and birthplace. He
knows the facts of the civil rights movement firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a retired minister and spokesman for the National Park
Service, marched across the South with the slain civil rights
leader.
</P>
<P>
   And on a recent visit to Ebenezer Baptist Church, one of the
many sites on the Atlanta tour, Williams shared stories of his time
with King. He captivates tourists with his personal knowledge of
the struggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we marched, we put a face cloth and toothbrush in
our pockets because we knew we were going to jail,'' he said,
recalling his arrest in Macon, Ga., while trying to integrate a
Holiday Inn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. King would call all of us ministers together from across
the state to find out about the problems we were having,'' said
Williams, who was a pastor in Macon when King began organizing
demonstrations across the region in the 1950s and '60s. ``Racial
injustices burned him, and he wanted to do something to change
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebenezer Baptist Church, the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for
Nonviolent Social Change, King's birthplace and grave all are
within a short walking distance from each other on Auburn Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   King preached at the church, where his father and grandfather
also served as pastors. For more than 80 years, ministers of the
church were from the same family. Pictures of King's grandfather,
the Rev. A.D. Williams, and his father, Martin Luther King Sr.,
have been added into the stained glass windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``This church has both fond and sad memories,'' Williams said,
as he greeted visitors to the historic site recently.
</P>
<P>
   The church, completed in 1922, became a national place of
mourning in April 1968 when King's body lay below the altar.
Ebenezer was marked with sadness again in 1974 when King's mother,
Alberta, was murdered while playing the church organ, Williams
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ebenezer became the focal point of community life in Atlanta
during the 1950s and '60s. King used the Gothic-style church as a
meeting place to discuss strategies for integration.
</P>
<P>
   STROLLING AUBURN AVENUE
</P>
<P>
   Just a short walking distance away, is King's birthplace at 501
Auburn Ave. The two-story Queen Anne style house was built in 1895.
</P>
<P>
   King's grandfather purchased the house 14 years later. It was
occupied by the Williams-King family for 32 years. The slain civil
rights leader was born in the house on Jan. 15, 1929. A marker with
information about the house's history stands across the street.
</P>
<P>
   Strolling Auburn Avenue gives tourists a sense of the area's
importance and prominence during the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   The Auburn community was one of the wealthiest African-American
neighborhoods during the early 1900s and became a symbol of
achievement. Some of the structures date back to the 1800s and
efforts are under way to restore many of them.
</P>
<P>
   When King was growing up in the 1930s and '40s, Auburn Avenue
was lined with offices for banks, insurance companies, builders,
jewelers, tailors, doctors and lawyers. The community had its own
library, newspaper and business college.
</P>
<P>
   John Wesley Dobbs, who was a prominent political leader and
grandfather of former mayor Maynard Jackson, nicknamed the area
``Sweet Auburn.''
</P>
<P>
   FOLLOWING IN HIS FOOTSTEPS
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can stop by the National Park Service's visitors center
to plan their own walking tour. Or they can take an organized tour
of King's birthplace.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors' center features photographs, exhibits and video
that chronicle King's role in the civil rights movement.
International and national travelers visit the King Center each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Duol Rut, a native of the Sudan who lives in Clarkston, Ga., is
a regular at the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've visited several times, and I wanted my friends to see
it,'' Rut said, standing with a group from Sudan. ``This promotes
the history of a black person, and I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rut said the King Center dispels the negative stereotype images
that the media portrays of African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am really touched by this exhibit because I have read a lot
about Martin Luther King Jr.,'' said Jock Paleak of Nashville,
Tenn. ``I've spent an hour and a half walking around, and I think
we need to do more to follow in King's footsteps.''
</P>
<P>
   After viewing the visitors' center, tourists can stop by the
King Center's Freedom Hall Complex. The center was established in
1968 by Coretta Scott King and others to continue King's work
toward economic and social equality. Dexter, King's youngest son,
is the chief executive officer of the center.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the center stands King's crypt, surrounded by a water
fountain and a flame. Engraved in the white stone are the words:
``Free at last. Free at last. Thank God Almighty, I'm free at
last.'' The words are the ones he spoke during his ``I Have a
Dream'' speech.
</P>
<P>
   In August, 1963, King made that speech when he and 250,000
protestors marched to the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. The
U.S. Postal Service, which selected the speech as one of the top 15
events of the 1960s, is planning to unveil a new King stamp, which
will go on sale in February.
</P>
<P>
   CENTER DISPLAYS LIFE, INFLUENCES
</P>
<P>
   Inside the center, displays honor the accomplishments and lives
of King and his wife, Coretta, Rosa Parks and Mohandas Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
   Parks was a tired seamstress who refused to give up her bus seat
to a white passenger in December 1955 in Montgomery, Ala. Her
refusal became a rallying point for King and others to push for
integration of public accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   Parks' life and involvement in the civil rights movement are
profiled through a series of photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Gandhi, a the religious and political leader, fought British
discrimination against Indians. King studied Hindu leader's
teachings and considered him a mentor. Gandhi was assassinated in
1948.
</P>
<P>
   The largest room in the center contains memorabilia and
artifacts from Coretta Scott King and her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Display cases contain the jacket and boots worn by King during
some of his protests. Beside the boots is the key to his room at
the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tenn., the place where King was
assassinated on April 4, 1968.
</P>
<P>
   There are several other places along Auburn Avenue, including
Fire Station No. 6, the oldest fire station in Atlanta and the
Sweet Auburn Curb Market, which was shopped by both black and white
residents during segregation.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors could spend three to four hours viewing all the sites
and taking in the exhibits, which are free and open daily.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO:
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service visitor's center is open from 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m. daily. It provides information about exhibits, tours and
the historic sites.
</P>
<P>
   Tours of King's birthplace are provided daily. Guests can sign
up for a guided tour, which is limited to 15 people at a time. The
tours are provided on a first come basis.
</P>
<P>
   For more information about the King tour, contact the
superintendent for the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic
Site, 450 Auburn Ave., NE, Atlanta, Ga. 30312-1525 or call (404)

COMMENTARY: WHEN IS IT NEWS? 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a lifetime in daily journalism, I still worry when real
news is treated as no news at all. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Journalists write about what interests them and, they hope, a
slice of their particular audiences large enough to keep their
newspaper or TV station a daily habit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In free countries, the variety of journals and broadcasts
guarantees information on every subject that touches on what is
important in human life, with large dollops of what is deliciously
unimportant.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Together they are life colors, separating free people from the
dreadful dirty-gray of despotism. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every subject _ but not quite. Sometimes, journalists decided
that some subjects were not news _ like the communist slaughter of
millions of Soviet citizens, the Holocaust, poverty and racial
hatred in our own country, or certain universal essences like
religion and sexuality.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 7, in a U.N. committee room, delegates from 19
countries will meet on a subject not mentioned on the agenda _
slavery: not slavery yesterday, but today, and by all signs for a
lot of tomorrows. It is a subject that, with shockingly few
exceptions, is evaded by journalism and democratic political
leadership.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I do not know why. Perhaps, in journalism, it is because in its
magnitude it is too complicated and varied for our poor minds to
deal with.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And anyway, there are no real spot slavery stories _ just
ongoing horror and misery. And who needs more of that?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is because, mostly, slavery befouls Third World
countries that are the current favorites of so many Western
journalists, intellectuals, ``statesmen'' and businessmen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In some of its forms, slavery enchains the bonded child workers
of India and Pakistan, and prostitutes of sexual playgrounds like
Thailand.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These varieties do not grab much journalistic or diplomatic
attention. The slavery involved in the U.N. meeting is the kind
that free people thought had disappeared with Abe Lincoln _ living
bodies captured by slave traders and bought and sold like meat, as
in Sudan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sudan's slaves come from the south of their country. They are
trapped in the three-decade-long civil war between the Muslim north
and the largely Christian and animist south. Khartoum sends armed
raider-trains southward, to take and sell slaves, and grab food
sent to war victims by international organizations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The slaves live slave lives _ murderous labor, rape, hunger,
torture, the totality of degradation. They are said to be worked
harder, fed less, beaten more than were the slaves of the American
South and Caribbean, because they are cheaper.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fifty dollars buys a slave, so it really does not matter how
long they survive before their bodies are thrown into some river.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. committee will discuss penalties _ not against Sudan,
but against Christian Solidarity International, one of the foreign
organizations fighting for the victims of Sudan's war of starvation
and enslavement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the 19 nations complained that CSI, which has supporters
worldwide, had sponsored a Sudanese rebel to speak at a committee
session in Geneva. But it had not clearly identified him or used
the proper letterhead. The country that complained was Sudan.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CSI apologized for these offenses, but the committee decided to
lift its credentials as a nongovernmental organization with the
privilege of speaking, but not voting, at meetings. The U.N.
Economic and Social Council then found that the committee itself
had violated the rules of procedure and ordered the whole vicious
comedy repeated. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons that Sudan singled out CSI for attack was its
support in America, which gives its work particular attention. The
United States voted against Sudan, alone. The roster of voters with
Sudan included Cuba, China, Lebanon, India, Pakistan, Russia,
Senegal and Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   This piece of nastiness is not about procedural technicality. It
is about permitting a slave-taking nation to stifle an organization
that struggles for slave-freeing.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If its credentials are lifted, Christian Solidarity
International will not be able to speak at the United Nations
anymore. But it will continue to work in Sudan at even greater
danger. And it will continue to get the help of those who believe
that slavery is news, wherever and whenever. &QL;
</P>

www.FreedomHouse.org/religion; www.Anti-slavery.org.

U.N. FACES MANY CHALLENGES IN ITS EFFORT TO RESHAPE THE KLA 
</HEADLINE>

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ After weeks of complex negotiations, NATO
and U.N. officials have agreed to the formation of a civilian
emergency force from the remnants of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   The army, once a guerrilla force against the Serbs, is being
dismantled this month under U.N. supervision. But though its
successor, tentatively called the Kosovo Corps, will retain much of
its military command structure, the duties of the new force remain
a sensitive issue.
</P>
<P>
   As details are worked out, the issue remains extremely delicate,
not least because of the implications for Kosovo Albanians'
aspiration for independence and for Yugoslavia's sovereignty over
this province.
</P>
<P>
   Though NATO sees the Kosovo Corps as a civilian force, the rebel
army's officers inevitably see it as a potential core of a future
national army, and are selling it to their followers as such.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will build a new army in the future, and the Kosovo Corps
will be one part of it,'' said Gen. Agim Ceku, the chief of staff
and a professional soldier for 20 years, who is negotiating the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Sept. 19 deadline for complete demilitarization of the 9,000
KLA troops has been extended 10 days, to allow more time for the
transformation, according to a spokesman at the Kosovo army
headquarters. But both army officers and officers from the NATO-led
peacekeeping force have expressed confidence that the army will
disarm.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the rebel force have never hidden their ambition to
turn the irregular force into a professional defensive army. Even
as they signed an undertaking in June to transform the army into a
civilian force within three months, Ceku and the army's political
leader, Hashim Thaci, said Kosovo would need its own armed force
for the day NATO troops leave.
</P>
<P>
   But after weeks of negotiations, they have settled for far less
than that. The new force is studiedly civilian, based on the
Securite Civile in France, and intended to cope with national
emergencies like forest fires, earthquakes, mountain rescue and
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless it will have 3,000 members, with a military
structure formed from the core commanders and brigades of the
present Kosovo Liberation Army. The force will have new
single-color uniforms and a limited supply of handguns to protect
equipment, and will receive training and equipment, including
helicopters, from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with leading officials in Kosovo this week,
officials with the United Nations, the peacekeepers and Kosovo
Albanians stressed the civilian aspect of the new force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the creation of an army,'' said Bernard Kouchner,
the U.N. special representative, who leads the civil administration
in Kosovo. ``You have to place this project within the ongoing
process of demilitarization. It will be a civilian system of
protection based on the model of the French Securite Civile.''
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeeping force, which will oversee the formation of the
new service, is rigid in its view of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot demilitarize and at the same time turn yourself
into an army,'' said Lt. Col. Robin Clifford, spokesman for the
peacekeeping command. Far from an embryo army, the new organization
is ``intended for those who want to be in uniformed public
service,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is under scrutiny in the capitals of Europe and in
Washington but so far appears to have been given the nod by the
council of NATO delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the clear statements by NATO and U.N. officials, the
political leaders of the army describe it as the future defense
force that they see as essential to Kosovo's struggle for
independence from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a symbolic organization because NATO is here now and
taking care of security,'' said Fatmir Lima, a former guerrilla
army commander and deputy defense minister in the provisional
government. ``But it will be a structured organization that will
prepare the young generation.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments were reflected elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo will have its defense force,'' said Thaci, the prime
minister of the provisional government, who signed the original
undertaking to demilitarize. ``I cannot imagine Kosovo without
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Thaci, who left Kosovo on Wednesday on an extended tour of
European capitals en route to Washington, made it clear that
independence remained his ultimate goal. ``I have never claimed
that I am for anything else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Western nations ``are understanding more and more that it should
be for the people of Kosovo to decide and for us to hold a
referendum,'' he said. ``Kosovo cannot be run from Belgrade but
only from within Kosovo.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   International representatives in Kosovo may privately agree with
Thaci's statements, but the formation of the Kosovo Corps is not so
much a recognition of Kosovo's future needs as a practical solution
to squash the rebel organization and control potential
troublemakers, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Since their arrival in Kosovo in June, the peacekeepers have
grappled with the high level of crime, much of which has been
attributed to members of the guerrilla army. That alone has made it
clear that the army would make a better ally than an enemy.
</P>
<P>
   As a military observer with the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe said, referring to the peacekeeping force,
known as KFOR: ``The main thing to avoid is a clash between KFOR
and the KLA. It is absolutely the last thing anyone wants because
it would explode the whole operation here.''
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the difficulties of persuading guerrilla fighters to
give up their weapons and adjust to civilian life, the peacekeepers
and the United Nations are offering them a range of options that
would provide employment and salaries.
</P>
<P>
   A large number of former fighters are being drawn into the
province's police service, which is eventually planned to be some
4,000 strong. Others have gone for civil administration jobs in
their regions. Most have returned home to rebuild their houses and
their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   They are being helped by the International Organization for
Migration, which is running a reintegration program providing
training and even university stipends for ex-soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner is a passionate defender of the need to respect the
former fighters and help them adjust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand perfectly the people who fought in the ranks of
the KLA, their demand for dignity,'' he said. ``They must be
allowed to reintegrate into civilian life and feed their families.
They need to be among their companions, in a solid structure, that
is disciplined, well-equipped, with an esprit de corps, capable of
fulfilling legitimate and honorable missions of which they can be
proud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The failure of such a project could only reinforce the mafia
and encourage an underground army.''
</P>
<P>
   That may happen anyway. For all the guerrilla army leaders'
evident cooperation, there are signs that they are distressed as
they realize they are cooperating in breaking up their rebel army.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not at all happy,'' said a local journalist. ``What
kind of uniforms matter when it is an unarmed army? They are going
to look like marionettes, a puppet army.''
</P>
<P>
   The army's political leadership also faces a difficult future
because the peacekeepers and ultimately the U.N. mission will
assume control of the new force.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci said he would shortly announce the formation of a
political party, although his tardiness is being interpreted as a
failure to draw all the leaders around him. Some close associates
have already split and formed their own political party, local
newspapers reported this week.
</P>
<P>
   There are some commanders who may go it alone, refusing to join
any structure and preferring to retain their life of the last
decade as powerful local figures outside the system. There are also
signs that the more secretive units of the guerrilla army, like the
special forces and intelligence units, do not intend to disband and
will go underground.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel force, never a totally cohesive structure, may
dissipate, but it may also throw out dangerous splinter groups, a
Western military observer warned. With the Kosovo Corps, the
peacekeepers are trying to corral the main players, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is indispensable for the functioning of the country, and we
need it even for security and reconciliation,'' a senior U.N.
official said. ``We need them and they need us.''

LITTLE CHANCE SEEN FOR RECONCILIATION IN EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor _ On Sunday, a militia leader and a guerrilla
commander, enemies in the long and bloody fight over independence
for this violence-wracked territory, exchanged a warm bear hug in
front of the international news media, promising to lay down their
arms.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, reporters saw Eurico Gutteres, the same
pro-Jakarta militia chief, wielding an automatic rifle in the
streets. And in the days since Monday's relatively trouble-free
vote on independence, his black-shirted militias have shot
opponents, chased observers and United Nations workers, blocked
locals from leaving the territory, and beaten journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have hugging and we have killing, and hugging and killing
don't normally go together,'' said Donald Emmerson, an Indonesia
specialist at the University of Wisconsin who observed Monday's
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, two local UN employees were slain in Maliana, a
pro-Jakarta stronghold 80 miles southwest of Dili. On Wednesday,
five locals were believed killed in clashes outside the UN compound
in Dili.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no possibility of protecting either ourselves . . . or
anybody else,'' said Ian Martin, head of the UN mission in Dili.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people, including 25 journalists, were evacuated on a
military transport plane Thursday, following rumors that they would
be the next target.
</P>
<P>
   When the UN announces the results of the referendum in a few
days, the count is expected to overwhelmingly favor independence
over Indonesia's offer of autonomy within the farflung island
nation.
</P>
<P>
   But the chapter cannot close on the 24-year struggle between
those who want self-rule and those who want Indonesian sovereignty
until the sides reconcile and find a way to live together _ a
prospect that for now seems dim.
</P>
<P>
   This week's renewed lawlessness raised questions about the
stability of any future peace for East Timor's 800,000 residents _
a population that already endured civil war, human rights abuses,
starvation, and disease during the early years of Indonesian rule
in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades later, pro-independence leaders, including former
guerrillas, look likely to take power through the ballot box, and
they have pledged to grant amnesty for political crimes committed
before the vote. They also welcomed non-Timorese Indonesians to
remain without fear of reprisal or discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   But pro-Jakarta militants show no signs of giving up the fight.
And there is a gaping disconnect between what some leaders say, and
what they do.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a reconciliation committee composed of two dozen
representatives of both sides met for the first time. The same
afternoon, a pro-Indonesia leader announced a boycott of the
committee. Only six members showed up, a showing that does not
augur well for harmony in the new East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers agree that if independence wins, it would not
only be impossible, but unwise, to marginalize pro-autonomy
leaders. But getting those leaders to play ball rather than act as
spoilers is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Emmerson draws a parallel between the beginnings of the
reconciliation process in the last week and what happened in 1975
in Vietnam, when it became apparent that North Vietnam would win
the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the handwriting on the wall became more and more legible,
there were a lot of (South Vietnamese loyalists) who were unable to
leave and who began to lay low, switch sides or try to camouflage
themselves,'' Emmerson said. ``We saw the same thing'' in parts of
East Timor, ``where pro-autonomy people were quietly making
promises'' to independence leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, pro-Indonesia militias have not renounced the fight.
But privately, said James Fox, an Australian specialist on
Indonesia who observed this week's vote, ``the autonomy people have
known for some time that the game was up.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who knows leaders on both sides, says moderates have been
talking to one another for months. Apart from a few extremists,
most autonomy leaders are acting tough in the vacuum after the vote
as ``a way of saving face,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If reconciliation has to be total, it'll never happen,'' Fox
said. ``But there are already people in the middle who have
privately reconciled.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also the question of what Indonesia will do. It can
sabotage independence, try to co-opt the victors, or support them.
</P>
<P>
   There is a struggle in Jakarta's leadership over whether to let
East Timor go graciously or force it to stay. The outcome will go
far to determine how smoothly East Timor can make the likely
transition from Indonesia's 27th province to the world's newest
tiny nation.
</P>
<P>
   For 2 1/2 decades, East Timor has been the place where
Indonesian military officers made their careers, just as a
generation of American officers earned their stripes in Vietnam.
Many Indonesian officers married East Timorese, acquired land and
now control the island's business interests; and they are not eager
to cede their influence. Independence leaders have promised to
honor ``legitimate'' property rights, but there are cases of
ill-gotten wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The army is accused of training, arming, and doing nothing to
stop pro-Jakarta militias in campaigns of terror that cost scores
of lives this year.
</P>
<P>
   A defense ministry memo leaked in July proposed a slash-and-burn
campaign if East Timor chooses independence. At least one senior
Indonesian official has spoken of washing his hands of the
``ungrateful'' province, pulling out infrastructure, and curtailing
Dili's budget if it voted for independence.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the military's intransigence over losing East Timor
appeared to be fading, at least publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia sent hundreds of riot police to Dili, and top generals
said they would invite UN peacekeepers and withdraw Indonesian
forces if East Timor votes for independence _ a radical departure
from Jakarta's previous stand.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about veteran officers who are trying to hang onto East
Timor, Brigadier General Soedrajat told the Jakarta Post that ``all
parties with emotional ties'' to the province should view the
likely transition ``as historical fact.''

TRES MAGNIFIQUE! PARIS LAS VEGAS OPENS ON TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Embargoed until Sunday, Sept. 5) &HT;     By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ In Paris, as in all of France, those who insist on a
rigid time schedule are often held in disdain (or dismissed as
American tourists; same thing), whether the issue is the serving of
a second course, the reopening of a shop after lunch or the
summoning of a plumber.
</P>
<P>
   But the new Paris Las Vegas Casino Resort defied the traditions
of both Paris and the Strip this past week when it opened on
schedule _ and actually had everything up and running.
</P>
<P>
   It lit up its scaled-down Eiffel Tower replica and welcomed a
stampede of curiosity-seekers into a property that boasted all
rooms finished, all restaurants and shops open, a casino clanging
and whirring for all it was worth. And there was not a touch-up
construction worker in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was brought in on budget and, more importantly, on time,''
said Arthur M. Goldberg, president and CEO of Park Place
Entertainment Corp., the company that bankrolled the 2,916-room
hotel which lies directly across the Strip from Bellagio. ``More
importantly, we're not going to have three grand openings.''
</P>
<P>
   The term ``opening'' has undergone a dramatic redefinition
during Las Vegas' recent building boom. There was no trouble
launching an Italian lake resort 11 months ago, as Bellagio opened
on schedule, but since then, there has been trouble in both
Polynesia (the Mandalay Bay) and Venice (the Venetian). The
Mandalay Bay didn't have all its restaurants ready when it opened
in March, then had to shut down its wave pool because of a major
design flaw. The Venetian then opened in May ... and in June ...
and in July, as construction delays plagued such signature features
as its gondola canal.
</P>
<P>
   Paris Las Vegas, mindful of the public-relations fallout
suffered by the others, was determined to get it right. And when
the public poured in last Wednesday night, it didn't have to step
around scaffolding and drop cloths or peer into still-dark shops.
</P>
<P>
   What the customers found instead was a fairly impressive
offering _ if you're excited by knockoffs of famous cities built in
the middle of the Mojave Desert.
</P>
<P>
   Although much of the Paris Las Vegas focus has been on its
replicas of the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe and such Paris
facades as the Louvre, Paris Opera House and Hotel de Ville, one of
the property's most popular features could prove to be its retail
and dining area. Le Boulevard District is laid out along a winding,
cobblestone alleyway under a perpetually blue, partly cloudy,
movie-set sky. Boutiques along the walk feature an impressive array
of French home furnishings, apparel and confections. The 85,000
squre-foot casino is designed in the motif of Paris street scenes
with cafes along the the edges and a park running through it.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, the route includes a boulangerie, a patisserie and a
fromagerie. In fact, the working bakery will furnish fresh bread to
all eight of the hotel's restaurants _ it's to be delivered by
bicycle twice a day.
</P>
<P>
   Paris Las Vegas, whose reported $790 million price tag was about
half the amount spent to build Bellagio ($1.6 billion) and the
Venetian ($1.5 billion), strains mightily to create an atmosphere
that conforms to the decor. Casino security guards are dressed in
gendarme uniforms, right down to the white belts. The cocktail
waitress costumes appear to be a derivation of Air France flight
attendant uniforms _ but only if a 14-year-old boy were permitted
to design them. Maintenance workers wear berets and vests.
</P>
<P>
   Employees of the resort underwent ``French cultural training''
so as to learn various words and phrases in the language. On any
walk across the hotel grounds, you're in danger of being bon joured
right into catatonia.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with Las Vegas' theme obsession, the place is pure
fantasy. No litter. No graffiti. No dog waste. No art. No history.
And all those smiling, cheerful salutations from the help bear no
relationship to what tourists routinely encounter in the real deal.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Las Vegas visitors are sure to love it _ at least until
next year, when Aladdin opens up shop next door as the latest Strip
sensation.
</P>
<P>
   Paris Las Vegas' most popular attraction is sure to be an
elevator ride to the observation deck at the top of the half-size
Eiffel Tower _ it can be had for $8. Anyone who walks beneath the
two-thirds scale Arc de Triomphe, meanwhile, might be startled to
find that this one, too, lists the names of all the towns that
Napoleon and his armies stomped through in 1805.
</P>
<P>
   But the real marvel of Paris Las Vegas remains the fact that it
did not have to push back its scheduled opening, or, worse, have
one or two ``soft'' openings followed by a supposed grand one.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Park Place Entertainment did in constructing a Paris (Las
Vegas) timeline was to put a cushion in there,'' said hotel
spokesman Andy Maiden, who added that the contractors actually
turned over the property three weeks ago, allowing ample time for
finishing touches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided when we opened, we'd open completely.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Paris Las Vegas room rates range from $129 to $239, with
suites (295 of the hotel's 2,916 rooms) priced from $350 to $5,000.
Address: 3655 Las Vegas Blvd. South. Reservations: (888) 266-5687.

STOCKS RESUME THEIR SWOON 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices resumed their late-summer swoon Thursday
in another session clouded by nervousness over a hyperactive
economy and whether the Federal Reserve will decide it needs to
raise short-term interest rates again to keep inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
   As they braced for the government's report Friday on the August
job market, traders and investors had to contend with word that the
automotive industry sold cars and trucks last month at the fastest
pace since December 1986 and with a warning by Edward Kelley, a
Federal Reserve policy-maker, that it is ``premature'' to rule out
a third rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``The compass continues to point in one direction,'' said
Jeffrey Applegate, chief U.S. strategist at Lehman Brothers.
``People are increasingly worried that the Fed is not on hold.''

   At the close, the Dow Jones industrials were down 94.67 points,
to 10843.21, nearly erasing Wednesday's rally and making it five
losing sessions out of six since setting a record at 11326.04 on
Aug. 25.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's 0.87 of 1 percent decline compared with setbacks of
0.6 of 1 percent for the NASDAQ composite and 0.9 of 1 percent for
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, the latter two indexes heavily weighted
with expensive high-tech stocks that are especially sensitive to
rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interest rates going up puts a lot of burden on price-earnings
multiples'' and on financial stocks, said Paul McManus, research
director at Independence Investment Associates in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   J. P. Morgan, down 3 11/16 to 125 15/16, and American Express,
down 3 1/8 to 135 7/8, placed first and third, respectively, in
contributing to the skid in the Dow industrials. Sears Roebuck,
which slumped 3 11/16 to 33 1/2 after warning of a profits
shortfall, was the second-biggest drag.
</P>
<P>
   Although 20 of the Dow's 30 stocks fell, these three issues
accounted for 55 percent of the total drop. Analysts attributed a
late rebound in the Dow, which had been down as much as 205 points
at one stage, to traders covering short positions and to the
activation of some buy programs.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, an unusually high total of 2,078
issues declined while 874 advanced, a ragged performance that added
to the general sense of market deterioration. Stocks making new
52-week lows, moreover, outnumbered those making new highs by more
than five to one _ 118_22.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, analysts noted that activity remained on the
light side, with 684.3 million shares changing hands on the Big
Board compared with 697.1 million during Wednesday's rally.
</P>
<P>
   Retailing stocks other than Sears were also hit Thursday,
reflecting fears of higher rates and a slowdown of torrid consumer
spending. Dayton Hudson fell 1 5/8 to 56 5/8, J.C. Penney 1 11/16
to 36 7/16, and Best Buy 10 1/2 to 61 7/16, after personal-computer
promotions failed to lift quarterly sales of the Minnesota-based
company as high as many had hoped. Wal-Mart, one of the few
merchants to buck the trend, rose 11/16 to 45 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Republic New York tumbled 7 3/16 to 62 3/16 after disclosing
governmental investigations of a client, which in turn prompted
HSBC Holdings to say this might delay its takeover of Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were caught in the general downdraft but few
of the losses were big. Rambus, however, slid 4 3/4 to 90 1/2 after
Intel said it would use a a less expensive, competing memory-chip
technology in response to demand by computer makers. Intel gained 1
7/8 to 85 5/16 to make the biggest positive impact on the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P finished 11.96 points lower at 1319.11. The NASDAQ
market was down 16.56 points at 2734.24.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks in major European markets fell by between 1 1/4 and 2 1/2
percent while Japan fell about 1 percent. Brazil's Bovespa,
however, advanced nine-tenths of 1 percent.

AUDIT FINDS FAULT IN NASA COST OVERRUNS ON SPACE STATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Congress prepared to cut NASA's budget to help
reduce domestic spending, a new audit criticizes cost overruns on
the international space station and the space agency's failure to
develop a long-term plan to control costs.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office audit estimates that the United
States will spend up to $26 billion over the next five years to
develop and assemble the orbiting laboratory and faults NASA for
not having a contingency plan to deal with future problems and cost
increases.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress returns next week, the House is expected to take
up a spending plan that recommends cutting NASA's 2000 budget by
more than $1 billion, including $100 million earmarked for the
space station.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the Capitol, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has
proposed putting a cap on the U.S. share of the international space
station. ``Unfortunately, disturbing cost increases and delays show
no sign of slowing down,'' said McCain, chair of the Senate
Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASA must stop operating under a blank-check mentality and
promptly provide a plan that shows their commitment to fiscal
accountability,'' said McCain, a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials point out that $200 million the House
Appropriations Committee wants to cut from the space agency budget
was requested to finance development of the long-term contingency
plan wanted by McCain and other congressional critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Independent auditors have determined these contingency plans
are critical and we need to have them,'' said Dan Hedin, chief of
staff for NASA's office of space development. ``I don't think there
is any way Congress will not fund that. They understand the need
for contingency planning.''
</P>
<P>
   First proposed as an $8 billion project during the Reagan
administration, the space station went through a major redesign in
the early 1990s when Russia agreed to join the United States,
Canada, Japan and the European Space Agency in the venture and
agreed to build several components and share the costs.
</P>
<P>
   Ten months ago, the GAO forecast the U.S. share of the 16-nation
project would reach $24.7 billion. Fifteen months ago, the estimate
_ which is based on data provided by NASA _ totaled $21.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials blame most of the agency's added costs on
Russia's ongoing economic woes. Not only has the financially
strapped Russian space agency failed to meet deadlines for building
key components, a share of its costs has been paid by the United
States to ensure that the project would not falter entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really the schedule slippage that's causing this
appearance that there's significant program growth,'' Hedin said.
</P>
<P>
   The first segment of the space station, a Russian-built control
module, was launched in November 1998, a year behind schedule. The
second component, built in the United States by Boeing, was added a
month later. In late November, the Russians are to send aloft a
43-foot service module, or living quarters, which originally was
scheduled to be in orbit in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO noted that the service module, which included living
quarters for three, communications, navigation and life-support
equipment, will be launched with a series of problems that will
have to be repaired while in orbit 240 miles above Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the problems noted by GAO was the Russians' failure
meet NASA standards for withstanding small pieces of space debris
that might penetrate the module and cause it to lose pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Hedrin described the debris-protection question as
non-consequential, pointing out that in its 13 years aloft the
recently decommissioned MIR space station was never troubled by
space debris. Also, the international space station will be brought
up to NASA standards 3 1/2 years after it is in orbit, even though
astronauts are to begin living in the laboratory next March.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel comfortable with what we're doing. That isn't a safety
issue,'' Hedrin said.

AFTER QUAKE, CYNICISM SEEPS INTO RURAL TURKEY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   GOLCUK, Turkey _ When summer began, Remzi Tarhan might have been
the happiest man in this sun-drenched town. Seventeen years after
moving here from his native village on the Black Sea coast, he had
finally realized his dream of opening a restaurant specializing in
anchovy casserole and other Black Sea delicacies.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant, and with it Tarhan's hopes for the future,
collapsed into ruins when Golcuk was struck by a shattering
earthquake Aug. 17 that left at least 14,500 people dead. Now he
wants to pack up his family and move back to the underdeveloped
eastern part of Turkey from which he came.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we stay here, we'll be struggling with chaos for years,''
he said as he stared out across acres of rubble. ``I don't want my
kids to grow up in that kind of climate. I started from zero when I
came here, and I'm ready to do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Golcuk and other towns that were devastated by the quake lie in
the heart of Turkey's booming industrial region. For a generation,
this area has drawn ambitious Turks from eastern provinces who come
in search of jobs and opportunity. But in a development that may
have profound social and political effects, many of those who came
here to build new lives are now saying they want to go back home.
</P>
<P>
   In this reverse migration, thousands of people who have lived in
prosperous parts of Turkey are likely to return to poorer regions.
Many will bring urban attitudes with them, along with a new-found
cynicism about their political system stemming from the
government's failures in the earthquake relief effort.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the disaster area said this week that since the
earthquake, more than 30,000 residents of the quake zone have moved
away after notifying the local authorities of their plans. At least
that many more, they estimated, have left without bothering to
comply with legal formalities.
</P>
<P>
   If enough of these people fan out through rural Turkey, they may
emerge as a new force for social and political change. Their
influence could accelerate the modernization of the country's less
developed regions, and also reshape political attitudes there as
they return with considerably less deference toward the government.
</P>
<P>
   Towns struck by the quake were not only booming economically
before the disaster but were also social melting pots where
well-to-do vacationers and business managers mixed with migrants
from backward regions. And they lie just a ferry ride away from
Istanbul, one of the world's most cosmopolitan cities and a hotbed
of social and political ferment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot like the immigrants who left Turkey to go to
Germany,'' said Ahmet Altan, a newspaper columnist and social
critic. ``They came back with new ideas and attitudes, and they had
a great effect on our society. When these earthquake victims go
back to their home towns, they won't like the way people live
there. They've seen modernity, wealth, movies, beautiful women.
They'll want to change things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who have lost their fear of the state,''
Altan continued. ``They saw from their experience in the earthquake
that the state has nothing to give them. They watched people die
because of the failures of the state. They're angry, and they'll
want to create something new, a new consciousness in those parts of
Turkey. I don't know if they can succeed, but it's a very
interesting development.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Among the earthquake victims who wants to leave is Emin Cakmak,
a craftsman who makes ceramic tiles. He left Sivas, one of Turkey's
most politically and culturally conservative towns, as a teen-ager
in 1966. Now, with his home and workshop in Golcuk destroyed, he
wants to return there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here because there wasn't any work in Sivas,'' Cakmak
said. ``But things are changing out there, and I think I could make
a living in Sivas now. The most important thing is to get out of
here. These towns where the earthquake hit are a mess, and they're
going to stay a mess for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to assess the work of the government and army in
earthquake relief, Cakmak said: ``If the state really cared about
human life, it would have been prepared for something like this.
The people of Turkey responded beautifully, and so did foreign
countries, even Greece, our supposed great enemy. But the state
didn't do much at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Such attitudes are potentially subversive in a land where ever
since the days of Ottoman sultans, people have been taught to
respect the state above all. President Suleyman Demirel reflected
this principle when he warned Turks to curb their anger over
problems in the relief effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be complaints, that is natural, but the state is
not a concept that you can replace with anything else,'' the
president said this week. ``So complaints should not turn into an
all-out criticism of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   That warning has been lost on many earthquake victims, among
them Emin Yildirim, a 50-year-old construction worker who lost
several close friends in the quake. He also lost his home, and has
spent the last two weeks living in a tent beside the Sea of
Marmara. As soon as he can put together enough cash for a bus
ticket, he said, he will move back home to Bayburt, an insular town
of 100,000 perched in the rugged mountains of northeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't rely on the state for anything,'' Yildirim said.
``You can only count on yourself, your family and your friends. I
have some skills and some ideas. Let's see what I can do with them
back in Bayburt.''

 &HT;    Uganda seeking investment
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Americans may see Uganda as the land of Idi Amin, the
country that intervened in a complicated multinational war in Congo
and the place where eight gorilla-seeking tourists were slaughtered
in March with machetes.
</P>
<P>
   But Uganda's prime minister, Apolo Nsibambi, came to Atlanta on
Thursday to offer a different view. Uganda is a stable country with
a growing economy, he said _ and a place in which Americans should
consider investing.
</P>
<P>
   Nsibambi spoke at at a trade and investment conference at the
Carter Center called East Africa 2000. The summit was organized by
Kenyans, Tanzanians and Ugandans living and working in the United
States. More than 100 people attended.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, sponsored by Coca-Cola Co., Western Union, Delta
Air Lines and other U.S. companies, was designed to tout the
benefits of an East Africa Cooperation Treaty expected to be signed
soon by Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty will create a common market by eliminating trade
barriers and easing the movement of labor and capital across
national borders.
</P>
<P>
   The economic joining of the three countries will create a market
of 80 million people, Nsibambi said, a market more attractive to
investors than each country considered separately.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rate of return in Africa is 29 percent,'' the prime
minister said in an interview, citing U.N. annual averages compiled
from 1990 onward. ``That is a great opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Uganda, a central African country about the size of Michigan
with a population of 22 million, has endured its share of troubles.
After gaining independence from Great Britain in 1962, it was
governed by two dictators _ first Prime Minister Milton Obote and
then Gen. Idi Amin, who was blamed for the deaths of hundreds of
thousands of his compatriots.
</P>
<P>
   The world's first known cases of AIDS were reported along the
shores of Lake Victoria in Uganda, and the disease has now driven
the life expectancy in the country down to 42.6 years. There are an
estimated 67,000 Ugandan children living with AIDS; more than 1
million children have been orphaned by it.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been progress, too. Amin was driven from power 20
years ago this summer. The rate of inflation, which was over 168
percent in 1986 has been pushed below 10 percent, Nsibambi said.
Since 1987, the economy has grown at 6 percent a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of public servants has been cut from 320,000 to about
half that _ Nsibambi called it ``right-sizing'' the public sector _
and spending on education has been greatly increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uganda is being transformed,'' the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
   Nsibambi offered these explanations of recent events that may
have concerned outsiders:
</P>
<P>
   _ Uganda's intervention in the civil war in Congo, on the side
of rebels trying to oust Congolese President Laurent Kabila, was
done in the name of stabilizing, not destabilizing, the area.
</P>
<P>
   The central government of Congo could not control the territory
or borders, Nsibambi said, leading to ``looters and vultures
thriving in a chaotic situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Uganda needed to prevent that instability from crossing the
border into its own territory. ``You want a stable neighbor,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   _ The slaughter by Rwandan rebels of gorilla-watching tourists
at Bwindi National Park depressed tourism for a time, but visitors
are coming back, he said. New security systems have been put in
place, including instant communications, the training of a ranger
force and the posting of army troops in the area.
</P>
<P>
   _ Uganda has been one of the few countries in Africa to deal
openly with AIDS, and the rate of infection is dropping, Nsibambi
said. Uganda's population has been educated, and ``they're loving
carefully,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister also said that a rebel insurgency is not
creating instability in Uganda any more than the Irish Republican
Army is creating instability in Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   And he said President Yoweri Museveni, in contrast to Amin, has
supplied ``enlightened leadership'' that relates well to the
international community.

BUSH OUTLINES PROPOSALS FOR EDUCATION REFORM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Presidential candidate George W. Bush, saying that
federal education programs allow schools to ``cheat poor
children,'' outlined Thursday his proposals for reforming education
that could shift millions of dollars out of low-performing public
schools to private and religious ones.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush said he would leave the day-to-day operations of
schools to local communities, his plan includes a series of federal
requirements on states and local districts. The plan, for example,
calls for all states that want federal money to test their pupils
and report to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a Hispanic business convention, Bush said the
reforms he would adopt if elected president next year would use
competition to improve the programs ``where educational failure has
its highest price,'' those designed to help disadvantaged children
in struggling schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some say it is unfair to hold disadvantaged children to
rigorous standards. I say it is discrimination to require anything
less _ the soft bigotry of low expectations,'' Bush said to
applause.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor offered a narrow version of a voucher
program, a reform he has championed unsuccessfully at the state
level.
</P>
<P>
   Poor parents whose children are educated with the help of Title
I federal funding would be allowed to withdraw their children _ and
the approximately $1,500 a year the school gets from Washington per
child _ from schools that are rated low-performing for three years
in a row and use the money to educate them in private schools,
charter schools or at home.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Bush's plan, both Democratic and Republican,
complained that Bush would wait three years to punish failing
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``So he sits there with his cowboy boots on his desk for three
years and takes no action?'' said Kiki Moore, a spokeswoman for
Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential front-runner.
``He talks about leaving no child behind. We look at the positions
he's taking and see no money left behind for the children.''
</P>
<P>
   J. Kenneth Blackwell, national chairman for Republican
presidential candidate Steve Forbes, asked if Bush was ``kidding''
about the three-year probationary period and noted, ``Governor
Bush's education plan is too weak, too narrow, and it still leaves
big government in control of the education monopoly, not parents.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic Los Angeles businessman Henry Cisneros, the
former San Antonio mayor and Clinton administration housing
secretary, said Bush's ``heart and his head are in the right
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros praised Bush's advocacy of bilingual education and
phonics-based reading education for disadvantaged preschoolers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told the Latin Business Association that he chose its
convention to unveil the first part of his education plan because
its members' personal successes shows how anyone with an education
can succeed in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``You embody the permanent hope, the durable dream, of this
nation _ to build a better life for ourselves and our children,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the federal government has tried for years to solve
this problem with ``sacks of money and the best of motives'' but
without success. He said 760 different education programs
administered by 39 agencies have few known results ``because no one
measures them.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also noted there was no need for a ``national school
board'' with the president serving as principal. He said local
people know best how to solve their local educational problems.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bush's plan:
</P>
<P>
   _ Every federal program in teacher training, curriculum,
research and school safety would be required to prove their success
or lose funding.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said this means he supports any bilingual education
programs that works at achieving English literacy, be it English
immersion or traditional bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   In Spanish and to applause from the Hispanic audience, Bush
dismissed ``English only'' programs because they mean ``only me,
without taking into account others.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Providers of the Head Start preschool program would be
required to use phonics to teach reading to more than 840,000 of
its 3- and 4-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Head Start was originally intended as a literacy program,
designed to close the achievement gap between rich and poor. It
evolved into a day-care, health and nutrition program,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his administration would move Head Start from the
Department of Health and Human Services to the Department of
Education and emphasize academics.
</P>
<P>
   Those that do not measure up will have their contracts put up
for competitive bidding ``allowing someone, including churches and
synagogues and community groups, to serve kids better.'' All new
Head Start contracts also will be open to competitive bidding.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reform Title I, the $7.7 billion-year program that helps
schools educate low-income students.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the federal government would require states to test
schools that receive Title 1 money to show progress. Successful
programs will get special grants. Unsuccessful ones will get a
warning and three years' probation.
</P>
<P>
   After three years with no improvement, the school's Title 1
money will be divided among its parents. When matched with other
federal funds received by the state, each parent would have about
$1,500 a year that they can use to educate their children by any
other means, including spending it on private school tuition.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a school, with ample time to change, continues to fail,
there must be some final point of accountability,'' Bush said. ``In
the best case, these schools will rise to the challenge and regain
the confidence of parents. In the worst case, we will offer
scholarships to America's neediest children.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas State Board of Education member Bob Offutt, one of the
board's most conservative members, said Bush's record on vouchers
does not bode well for his federal proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '94, candidate George W. Bush talked about educational
choice and for the most part, failed to deliver,'' Offutt said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said he would encourage states to adopt programs like
charter schools. Bush noted that five years ago only eight states
had charter schools, while today 35 states offer that option to
parents. Bush said 78 percent of the students in Texas charter
schools are minorities, not Anglos trying to flee the public school
system.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said government-required tests was the best way to measure
a school's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Measurement makes some people nervous, but without tests there
is no pressure for progress,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He said 37 percent of the principals in low-performing Texas
schools have been replaced or retired each year after campus scores
were released.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his program is designed to strengthen, not give up on
the public education system.
</P>
<P>
   ``One-sixth of the American population is in public schools. The
content of their education will determine the character of our
country,'' Bush said.

 &HT;    Dennis washes out holiday profit for N.C. businesses dependent
on tourism
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAGS HEAD, N.C. _ Dennis, the storm that wouldn't die, threatens
to claim one more victim: The Labor Day weekend crowd on North
Carolina's Outer Banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've kind of thrown in the towel,'' said Pam Gladden, whose
family has run the Blue Heron Motel in Nags Head for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the motel's 30 rooms, about 200 feet from the
Atlantic Ocean, suffered water damage when rain collapsed ceiling
tiles. Sand washed into a breezeway for the first time anyone can
remember.
</P>
<P>
   What will today _ and the weekend _ bring? Gladden says she
doesn't have the faintest idea. The cable TV's been out for days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been listening to the radio in the car,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The motel is booked through mid-October. But the soldout holiday
weekend has been wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a significant hurt,'' Gladden said, ``because it's not
only Labor Day but it's going to end up being a least a good week
now'' before the motel is back in business.
</P>
<P>
   But even as a late afternoon squall buffeted the coast Thursday,
washing out periods of welcomed sunshine, Nags Head Deputy Town
Manager Rhonda Sommer said some businesses would be open today and
into the weekend. Traditionally, Labor Day is the second-busiest
weekend of the year behind the Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina tourism officials were trying to get the word out
that Tropical Storm Dennis wasn't affecting the entire coastline.
Though Kitty Hawk and Cape Hatteras remained soggy, places like
Wrightsville Beach and Ocean Isle were typically picturesque.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though Dennis is affecting the northern part of our coast, the
southern part of our coast is having a beautiful day,'' said Chris
Mackey, spokeswoman for the North Carolina tourism department.
</P>
<P>
   Still, tourists worried, and skepticism that the coast was ready
for the Labor Day weekend extended to beach get-aways as far south
as Myrtle Beach, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Bobbie Gentry, a tourist shop cashier in Maggie Valley, N.C.,
eight hours inland, canceled a weekend trip to Cherry Grove near
Myrtle Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't really know what was happening,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Myrtle Beach expects about 400,000 people this weekend. That
could generate up to $55 million for the Labor Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's a beautiful day there and probably will be
Friday,'' Lou Fontana, spokesman for the South Carolina tourism
department, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He advised tourists bound for the Grand Strand to check weather
reports and to call their hotel today and through the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to put people in jeopardy,'' Fontana said. ``But
we know businesses depend on this weekend to cap off a good season.
You've got to make your best guess. We don't want people to lose
money. If they cancel, they'll lose money unless there's a
mandatory evacuation.''
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, nearly 70 percent of the coastal population
in summer is made up of tourists. Many were evacuated when Tropical
Storm Dennis first skirted the coast as a hurricane Sunday and
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, tourists and travelers spend about $396 million in
Dare County.
</P>
<P>
   They generate nearly $35 million in tax revenue, split almost
evenly between local governments and the state. Overall, travel and
tourism has a $10 billion impact on North Carolina, which had 41
million visitors in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis, whose beach-eroding tide surges stretched all the way to
Florida 400 miles to the south, remained within a hundred miles of
the Cape Hatteras coast and was drifting west and southwest.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, all but 500 of the 5,000 permanent residents of
Hatteras Island had power restored.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them stayed behind after officials ordered an evacuation
Sunday, then were stuck when N.C. 12, the island's only north-south
highway, became impassable.
</P>
<P>
   ``For over a mile, you don't see any blacktop,'' said Richard
Moore, state secretary of crime control and public safety. ``There
is some debate whether there is a roadbed there or not. It's beyond
the crisis stage. There are places where there are no dunes at all
and if you try to just throw blacktop down, you're throwing your
money away.''
</P>
<P>
   In Nags Head, prison inmate crews helped clear debris from the
beach and roads, including damaged stairways leading to the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors have condemned 70 beach front homes in Nags Head, for
problems ranging from damaged septic systems to shorted electrical
systems and undermined pilings.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want people to do is call and verify their
accommodations,'' Sommer, the Nags Head official, said. ``So many
rental homes have been damaged to the point of being
uninhabitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Gladden, the Nags Head motel operator, said it's not so bad when
she considers what could have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the last 30 years, the Lord has been very good to us,''
she said. ``This could have been a lot worse.

DNA TEST DISCOVERS LOWLY ORIGINS OF THE GRAND CHARDONNAY GRAPE

<TEXT>
<P>
   A scandal to shock wine connoisseurs to the last drop of their
being has been uncovered by the same kind of DNA test that is used
in paternity cases. An analysis by American and French scientists
has found that the chardonnay grape, considered one of the world's
greatest wine varieties, is a cross between the princely pinot and
a grape deemed so coarse that it is no longer grown in France.
</P>
<P>
   The outcast parent is called gouais blanc, its name derived from
the word ``gou,'' an old French term of derision. Thus, chardonnay,
long thought by some experts to be a light-skinned version of pinot
noir, now turns out to be a cross between pinot and plonk.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fascinating and surprising, particularly that one of
the parents is such an undistinguished grape variety,'' said Jancis
Robinson, a wine critic and editor of The Oxford Companion to Wine.
``It unsettles all our preconceptions about vine breeding. We would
normally assume you need two good-quality parents for a
good-quality progeny.''
</P>
<P>
   The previously unsuspected pinot-gouais liaison is also the
progenitor of 15 other varieties of grape that together account for
almost all the wine varieties grown in northeastern France. These
include gamay, from which all Beaujolais wines are made; melon, the
source of all muscadet, and another important Burgundy grape called
aligote.
</P>
<P>
   Though they have the same parents, the 16 grape varieties differ
from one another just like the children of a single family. Their
colors range across a spectrum from white-yellow and pink to amber
and blue-black.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis, reported in Friday's issue of Science, was
conducted by a team led by Dr. Carole Meredith, a biologist in the
Department of Viticulture and Enology at the University of
California at Davis.
</P>
<P>
   She started to explore the ancestry of the grape varieties in
the university's collection but, because many were derived from
French stocks, her inquiries soon led her to the French National
Institute of Agricultural Research at Domaine de Vassal, near
Montpellier, where many thousands of different grape varieties are
preserved.
</P>
<P>
   As she could not test them all, she selected some 300 varieties
that from their appearance and historical records seemed likely to
be related. Applying the same kind of DNA test used to identify
individuals in forensic cases, she and her colleagues uncovered the
long secret evidence of the pinot-gouais liaison.
</P>
<P>
   Even though most of the pinot-gouais' offspring are probably the
result of ancient crossings centuries ago, their ancestry can be
inferred from modern stock because grape varieties are propagated
vegetatively, meaning that each generation is genetically identical
with its predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   Pinot is no surprise as an ancestor; it is the oldest attested
variety in Burgundy and was referred to in the first century A.D.
by Columella, a Roman agricultural writer. Gouais, on the other
hand, was considered so mediocre that several districts tried to
ban it. Though not now cultivated in France, the grape was
preserved in the gene bank collection at Domaine de Vassal.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Meredith said that a colleague, Dr. John Bowers, succeeded
after a long search in finding a wine made from the gouais grape.
Called gwaess, the German form of gouais, it came from the Valais
region of Switzerland, where many unusual varieties are grown. ``It
tasted just like a decent white wine,'' Dr. Meredith said. ``There
doesn't seem to have been anything wrong with it.''
</P>
<P>
   How then did gouais get its bad reputation? Dr. Meredith noted
that it was very widely grown in the Middle Ages before being
replaced by what people considered the noble pinot. Popularity
``has always been suspect in France because of a belief that high
productivity and high quality were incompatible,'' Dr. Meredith
said.
</P>
<P>
   Condemned by elitism, gouais has evidently had the last laugh on
wine snobs by surviving as the unacknowledged parent of many
expensive wines.
</P>
<P>
   Many chardonnays used to be labeled pinot-chardonnay, but over
the last decade French lawmakers have discouraged the use of pinot,
largely because a leading expert declared on the basis of botanical
observation that there was no relationship between the two grapes.
``Just when they have got all mention of pinot off the labels, it
transpires you probably can call it pinot-chardonnay,'' Ms.
Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Meredith earlier used the same method to identify cabernet
sauvignon, perhaps the most esteemed red wine grape, as being a
cross between two other varieties, cabernet franc and sauvignon
blanc. According to an article in Science by Michael Hagmann, the
application of DNA fingerprinting to vines was developed by Dr.
Mark Thomas, a grape geneticist in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Varieties derived by crosses are legally forbidden in France to
bear the prestigious label ``Appellation d'Origine Controllee.''
Alain Bouquet, a grape breeder at the French National Institute of
Agronomic Research in Montpelier, told Science that the appellation
system was based on the assumption that varieties obtained by
crossing were inferior to the traditional varieties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is erroneous in the case of crosses between old
European varieties as it is now proven that the two best varieties
in the world, cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay, are derived from
such crosses,'' Bouquet said.

 &HT;    Investigation of Barton escape gaining support
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At least two Atlanta City Council members from
opposing camps said Thursday they would ask Police Chief Beverly
Harvard to start an inquiry into how Mark O. Barton slipped away
from more than 100 police officers after he killed nine people and
wounded 13 others in the Buckhead financial district July 29.
</P>
<P>
   While they have not read a 208-page police investigative file
that details the massacre, City Council members C.T. Martin and
Michael Julian Bond _ both members of the Public Safety and Legal
Administration Committee _ said they would ask Harvard about the
possibility of initiating the review. The review would amount to a
self-examination of how Barton eluded police after shooting his
victims at All-Tech Securities and Momentum Securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point they're going to have to critique themselves,''
said Bond, a supporter of Mayor Bill Campbell. ``Doing this would
be the prudent thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, chairman of the Public Safety Committee and a Campbell
critic, said he would read the 2-inch-thick investigative file
released by police officials earlier this week, then arrange a
meeting with Harvard and Deputy Chief C.B. Jackson to discuss an
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect that you would want to go over something like
this to see how you could do better,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon, Jackson told reporters that a review of how
Barton could pass undetected from the area where dozens of police
officers descended minutes after the massacre had not been done and
probably would not be.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard said Wednesday that police commanders met the day after
the killings to assess their officers' actions at the crime scene.
The chief conceded that the meetings were limited to discussions
about whether radios and other equipment functioned properly,
response times by officers and how the department worked with other
police agencies called to the scene for backup.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, however, Lt. Calvin Moss, the chief's
administrative assistant, said, ``No determination has been made on
a specific review regarding Barton's means of escape.''
</P>
<P>
   The review also should be done ``if nothing else, to find out
what can be done in the future if such a tragedy should ever happen
again,'' said Council President Robb Pitts.
</P>
<P>
   Jabari Simama, Campbell's communications director, said the
mayor would not second-guess the Police Department's actions.
</P>
<P>
   But Fred Herder, who was shot in the back at All-Tech, had
plenty to say about the lack of a review on Barton's elusiveness:
``There was a lot of confusion that day and this is probably the
most complex crime scene this Police Department has ever handled.
You would think they would have done a review on how Barton got
away. It's something you would expect.''

 &HT;    Wrestling video may have influenced boy to fatally beat toddler,
officials say
 &HT;    By Jingle Davis
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A 4-year-old Warner Robins boy blamed for kicking and
beating a toddler to death could have been imitating a videotape of
professional wrestling, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suspect the child was acting out from watching a wrestling
video,'' said Capt. Jerry Stewart of the Houston County sheriff's
office. The video was of the World Wrestling Federation's ``Summer
Slam'' event, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen-month-old Ramone Francois King, who died Sunday of a
fractured skull, also suffered liver damage and other injuries in
the attack Saturday, Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-year-old, along with King and five other youngsters, were
watching the video with their baby sitter, Earl Rose, 24, shortly
before the incident occurred, Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby sitter was keeping children for three mothers who
were working,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rose later told police he put King to sleep in another room,
then left the older children watching the video while he went to a
neighborhood store for 10 to 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, the 4-year-old went into the room where the
baby was sleeping and began hitting and kicking him,'' Stewart
said. ``Three of the other children went into the bedroom when they
heard the baby crying and told (the 4-year-old) to stop, which he
did. Then the other children left and we think the beating
continued.''
</P>
<P>
   King was struck with a hard plastic toy and kicked off the bed,
Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was beat up pretty good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No charges were filed against the 4-year-old, but Stewart said
he has spoken to the juvenile judge and asked the Department of
Family and Children's Services to intervene ``at least to the point
that the child is evaluated.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the baby sitter could be charged with neglect for
leaving the children.
</P>
<P>
   Two Atlanta psychologists said violent videos can provoke
children to violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between fantasy and reality is not that clear
at age 4,'' said Steve Garber of the Behavioral Institute of
Atlanta. ``Children this age still believe in Santa Claus and the
Easter bunny.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Blusiewicz said some wrestling programs are powerful
enough to even influence teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wrestlers are portrayed as heroes if they're successful in
knocking someone out,'' Blusiewicz said. ``It's really a
glorification of violent behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   She said such programs are misleading to youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't get that this is entertainment,'' she said. ``Until
puberty, and that can be age 14 or 15, children take things very
literally. They don't recognize window dressing or media hype.''
</P>
<P>
   In July, a 7-year-old Texas boy accidentally killed his
3-year-old brother after watching wrestling on television. The
older boy, asked to demonstrate what he'd done, backed up about 10
feet and ran toward a police detective who was holding a
toddler-sized doll. The boy forcefully stiff-armed the doll in the
neck, knocking it backwards. The 3-year-old died of brain injuries.

 &HT;    NCR buys world's largest ATM servicer
 &HT;    By Laura A. Bischoff
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ NCR Corp., the world's largest manufacturer of
automatic teller machines, bought Beavercreek-based Gasper Corp.,
which writes computer software to service ATMs, company officials
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal, which closed Wednesday, were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Gasper will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of NCR, allowing the
80-employee company to do work for ATMs manufactured by NCR,
Canton-based Diebold and other companies. The Gasper name and
management will remain.
</P>
<P>
   Gasper writes computer software that manages ATM service. The
software notifies ATM owners when machines need more money or
repairs and in some cases the software can remotely correct
malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   Networks that control about 20 percent of the ATMs worldwide and
half of the ATMs in the United States are managed by Gasper
software, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Founder David Gasper said Gasper Corp. and NCR are a good fit.
The deal instantly gives Gasper a presence in 125 countries, up
from the 31 nations where it now operates. NCR will be able to sell
Gasper's products and services around the globe, Gasper said.
</P>
<P>
   Gasper said he expects the company's staff and revenues to grow
under NCR. Last year's revenues were more than $6 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gasper founded the company in 1983 at age 27, a few years after
leaving NCR, where he worked for a short while as a software
developer for ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bray, NCR's vice president for worldwide service and
infrastructure, said the deal brings together the leaders of ATM
manufacturing and ATM service. ``We could see the synergy right
away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gasper said, ``I'll remain as president of Gasper. I expect to
continue to set the direction and make sure it's compatible with
NCR.''

officer by her side. But officials who know them both said the
image never really matched the reality. Disclosures that the FBI
failed to produce information from its files about the use of

GORE, IN BOSTON, TELLS OF US PLAN TO PROTECT OCEANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- After touring Boston Harbor on a New England Aquarium
research vessel with Boston-area teenagers Thursday, Vice President
Al Gore announced the formation of a federal task force to
implement 147 Cabinet recommendations for strengthening US ocean
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report's not worth much unless it's acted upon,'' Gore
said. Pointing to Boston Harbor as a success story, Gore said the
nation must take bold steps to save the waters. The oceans are
``not just part of the environment, . . . they're an engine of our
economy,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes about a year after the first national ocean
summit was held in Monterey, Calif., where President Clinton, Gore,
and four Cabinet secretaries met with scientists and advocates of a
national agenda to improve ocean health.
</P>
<P>
   Also, as expected, Gore announced a $5 million aid package for
New England's fishermen who have been hit hard with restrictions.
Those qualifying will receive up to $1,500 for each day that their
fishing grounds in the Gulf of Maine were closed by regulators this
past spring.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the key recommendations in the report included plans for
more coordination among agencies, creation of new incentives to
reduce overfishing, increased funding for marine sanctuaries such
as Stellwagen Bank for research and protection, and reduction of
coastal pollution caused by water runoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Before the announcements at the aquarium, Gore squatted down
with students to view an array of sea animals in tanks, checked
clarity of the harbor waters, and caught a jellyfish in a mesh net
used to catch plankton.
</P>
<P>
   Jody Kelman, 16, of Concord, who said she became interested in
the environment when she saw satellite images of Earth at age 5,
said she was impressed with Gore's knowledge of the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Roger McManus, president of the Center for Marine Conservation,
a nonprofit advocacy group, said the report is only a blueprint now
but this and the Monterey conference have brought the highest level
of attention to ocean conservation by any administration since that
of President Lyndon Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, the Johnson adminstration formed the Stratton
Commission _ named for its chairman, the former MIT president
Julius Stratton _ which led to the creation of the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration and laid the groundwork for the
Coastal Zone Management Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this as a milestone,'' said McManus. ``Now if we can
get Congress to pay attention.'' McManus said the United States'
ocean territory is larger than its land territory.
</P>
<P>
   But obstacles still abound. Congress has approved little funding
for ocean protection. And the United States is the only major
country that has not joined the United Nations' Law of the Sea
Convention, which sets international standards for the world's
oceans.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Gore also announced that Clinton signed a
proclamation Thursday giving federal authorities the right to
enforce environmental, customs, and immigration laws at sea within
24 nautical miles of shore, extended from 12 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Robert B. Gagosian, director of the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution, said a national umbrella to coordinate agendas from
the different agencies must be created because priorities are too
scattered.

cajoling, funny and almost friendly; most of them, however, range
from angry to nasty to insulting.
</P>
<P>
   The line includes specialized greetings for holidays (``It's New
Years Eve! I just wanted you to know. ... You're now another year
behind on your child support''), occasions (``If this birthday card
costs $2.95 and a stamp is 33 cents ... then that is still more

... Unfortunately, I have better odds of being struck by
lightning'').

FLEET-BANKBOSTON DEAL GETS LEGAL OK FROM US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The Department of Justice Thursday gave its approval
to the biggest bank divestiture in US history, requiring that Fleet
Financial Group Inc. and BankBoston Corp. sell customer deposits
totaling $13.2 billion as a condition of merging.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials confirmed Sovereign Bancorp Inc. of Philadelphia
would buy the vast majority of Fleet's business on the sale block
under the Justice Department's agreement, which is a crucial step
toward completing the biggest banking merger New England has ever
seen.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Sovereign would enter the New England
market armed with $12.4 billion in deposits from 278 branches in
Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire, as
well as hundreds of loan accounts and a network of more than 500
automated teller machines.
</P>
<P>
   The approval concludes a difficult phase of negotiations
involving the merger partners, bidders for Fleet's assets, and
regulators. Before the deal is closed, Fleet must also win approval
from Massachusetts officials and the Federal Reserve Board. The Fed
has scheduled consideration of Fleet's request for approval to
merge at a meeting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department became involved in the merger of Fleet
and BankBoston, New England's largest banking companies, to ensure
that competition in New England banking would be preserved through
the sale of some business to a large, out-of-region bank.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Justice's approval, some analysts questioned whether a
$24 billion Sovereign would be strong enough to battle a combined
Fleet-BankBoston, a behemoth institution with $165 billion in
assets.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant US attorney general Joel Klein said, ``These
divestitures should ensure that customers continue to get the
benefits of competition _ competitive loan rates and the best
banking services.''
</P>
<P>
   US Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat, _
echoing views expressed by other public officials in recent months
_ said he would've ``preferred'' the single big chunk of assets be
sold to a bank in Massachusetts, which would immediately be in ``a
position to compete.'' Meehan added he was ``satisfied'' that the
government had ``reviewed the competitive implications'' of selling
Fleet's business to Sovereign.
</P>
<P>
   But Meehan and other members of a Washington delegation that
lobbied to ensure small banks would be allowed to bid on Fleet
branches got what they wanted: The Justice Department said 28
branches would be sold to small banks in Massachusetts, 15 of them
on Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   Once the sale to Sovereign is signed, Fleet plans to finish
negotiating the sale of additional branches _ which hold about $810
million in deposits _ to numerous community banks, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice confirmed we don't need to sacrifice the future of
community banks in Massachusetts to ensure that Fleet has enough
competition in the region,'' Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department agreement has numerous conditions aimed
at ensuring Fleet has competitors, said Connie Robinson, director
of merger enforcement for the department.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet would sell nearly all of its 500-plus ATMs to Sovereign,
but the merged entity would retain all of the BankBoston ATMs.
Sovereign, by taking over the ATMs, would gain a key component of
Fleet's retail banking business, officials said. One source said
even ATMs at One Federal Street, the current location of Fleet's
headquarters in Boston, would go to Sovereign. (Fleet would keep a
handful of its own ATMs, including one at the FleetCenter.)
</P>
<P>
   On the loan side of the business, officials said the branches
targeted for sale ensured that Sovereign would acquire a huge part
of Fleet's portfolio of small and mid-sized loans, mainly loans in
the $1 million to $10 million range. In a novel twist, Justice also
said Sovereign would be permitted to hire the loan officers who
handle those accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That middle market was kept intact,'' said Massachusetts
Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly, who confirmed Sovereign was the
winning bidder for the bulk of Fleet's business.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said Sovereign still would not have the critical
mass of some local competitors. In Massachusetts, for example,
Sovereign would pick up $2.3 billion in commercial loans _ only
slightly more than half of Citizens' commercial loan portfolio in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who oversaw negotiations with Fleet, declined to
discuss Sovereign specifically. ``We know who the buyer is, and we
concluded the buyer could compete in this market,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``Size isn't always a determinant of how competitive
a bank is. What's important is that someone has the assets and the
wherewithal and the desire to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Justice said Fleet would sell branches in
four states: 204 branches and $8.6 billion in deposits in
Massachusetts; 50 branches and $2.3 billion in Rhode Island; 39
branches and $1.8 billion in Connecticut; and 15 branches and $544
million in New Hampshire. Branches being sold in Massachusetts are
mainly Fleet's, while the Connecticut and Rhode Island branch sales
are mainly sales of BankBoston branches.
</P>
<P>
   Sovereign would faces numerous hurdles when it enters a new
market where must compete against Fleet, Citizens and other local
banks, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Sovereign has demonstrated its resourcefulness in competing in
Philadelphia in the wake of a merger between First Union Corp. and
CoreStates. In that deal, too, Sovereign purchased a big chunk of
the divested assets.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Sovereign's executives unfamiliar with New
England's market won't be able to jump in as a strong competitor
right away. And neither Sovereign, Citizens, nor any other bank
would be able to compete in advertising or ATM access against the
financial might of a sprawling Fleet-BankBoston empire.
</P>
<P>
   But banking analysts said the national banking market is
changing rapidly, and the Fleet-BankBoston deal is one of numerous
mergers among banking giants.
</P>
<P>
   These big commercial banks now must compete against firms such
as Merrill Lynch and GE Capital. Smaller banks _ from Sovereign to
Cape Cod Bank &AMP; Trust _ will be left to serve small businesses and
retail customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole purpose of'' of merging with BankBoston ``from
Fleet's perspective, is to eliminate another major competitor,''
said Larry Cohn, a bank analyst for Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co. in Livingston,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``Sovereign has been a good competitor in
Philadelphia, and I'd think they would be effective in Boston as
well.''

 &HT;    MindSpring TV ads focus aim to reel in newcomers
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ MindSpring Enterprises rolls out phase one of its
first-ever TV ad campaign on Monday in 12 markets.
</P>
<P>
   The comic, low-key ads each end with the company's new tagline:
``You'd be happier using MindSpring.''
</P>
<P>
   The spots will run during network programming on over-the-air
broadcast networks, including ABC, NBC, and Fox. Viewers can look
for the spots during Atlanta Braves, Hawks and Falcons games, ABC's
``20/20'' and ``The Drew Carey Show'' and NBC's ``Just Shoot Me''
and a variety of other NBC sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that our users and people who are likely to become
our users are not heavy TV viewers,'' said Lance Weatherby,
MindSpring executive vice president of marketing. ``They are TV
viewers who tend to watch appointment TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Weatherby also says this is not a national ad buy, but rather
local spots during network shows. Weatherby says the local buys are
to make sure MindSpring is only advertising in markets where it can
provide its Internet access service.
</P>
<P>
   The two spots viewers will see next week, and the seven others
the company plans to roll out by the end of the year, are all
directed by Mark Pellington, best known as the video director for
Pearl Jam's ``Jeremy'' video.
</P>
<P>
   They all feature a twenty-something guy (stand-up comic Andrew
Donnelly) in a park with his dog, chatting with fellow
bench-sitters and passers-by about the many virtues of MindSpring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you,'' Donnelly's character tells a skeptical stranger
in one spot. ``MindSpring says that to me all the time. Well, not
in so many words but that's what they're feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Another spot debuting later this year pokes fun at the company's
modest West Peachtree headquarters. ``I bet if you looked up
reliability in a dictionary you'd find a picture of MindSpring,''
Donnelly says. ``Well, maybe not. Their offices aren't that much to
look at.''
</P>
<P>
   Each ad touts a different aspect of the company, from technical
support to high-speed capability.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring has built its reputation on customer service and
support and Weatherby says the understated and funny approach is
designed to communicate the idea that MindSpring is dedicated to
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jumping into TV gives us the opportunity to present a unified
message that we didn't have before,'' he says. ``It's hard to set
the tone for your company or your brand with just print and
billboards. TV is a much better way to brand the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Weatherby estimates the total cost of the TV campaign is $1.2
million. Analysts place the total cost of MindSpring's fall
advertising blitz, which includes TV, radio, print and direct mail,
at about $90 million between the fourth quarter of 1999 and the
first quarter of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Weatherby won't say how much the campaign will cost, but he said
that MindSpring is comfortable with the analysts' estimate.
</P>
<P>
   The spots haven't been tested in focus groups or elsewhere prior
to their initial airing on Monday. MindSpring executives and staff
are anxiously awaiting viewer response. Weatherby hopes it will
generate new subscribers as part of the company's effort to reach
the 2 million subscriber mark by the middle of next year. The
company's goal is to be the second-largest ISP, trailing only
overwhelming leader America Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very consumer-friendly promise,'' says Alex Kaminsky,
MindSpring's senior director of marketing communications. ``We
promise to make your Internet service as good as it can be. It's
not really a campaign in the truest sense, but really trying to let
people know we respect you and will treat you right.'' However, a
series of ads, no matter how quirky or funny they might be, are
designed to generate orders. If MindSpring can't accommodate the
new subscribers, the campaign will not only be a failure but an
embarrassment. Weatherby knows this all too well. He says that the
process of setting up service and support for the hoped-for
MindSpring newcomers was months in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``This quiet voice is making an enormous promise,'' Kaminsky
admits. ``If we tell people we deliver, we have to deliver. We are
putting ourselves on the line in a very big way.''

MARKETPLACE: A DELAY FOR THE BIG BOARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bowing to regulatory concerns, the New York Stock
Exchange on Thursday delayed plans to convert to public ownership
until next year, and its chairman said it would consider making its
self-policing unit a separate entity.
</P>
<P>
   Backing away from his own aggressive prediction that the
conversion would occur by Thanksgiving, chairman Richard Grasso
said that ``very significant public policy'' questions remain.
Concerns about the structure of the regulatory unit and tax issues
led the exchange's board to vote to delay the possible initial
public offering, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But if those issues are resolved, he said he expects the board
to vote sometime next year to transform the NYSE into a publicly
traded company, ending more than 200 years as a member-owned
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   A public offering could raise considerable funding for the
exchange and give it a currency useful for acquisitions as it faces
increasing challenges from electronic trading networks, data
companies and other competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The conversion must be ``formulated through the lens of doing
what is right for the public user,'' Grasso said at a press
conference after the board's meeting. ``How do we engender the same
level of public confidence and support that we have enjoyed?'' The
exchange's success, he added, ``will be largely destined by the
public's confidence in the self-regulating process.''
</P>
<P>
   The regulatory unit can fine and discipline members, as well as
arbitrate disputes. But with public ownership, the exchange could
be placed in the awkward position of having its own regulators
attempting to discipline a major shareholder, or having Wall Street
firms influencing the regulatory unit's budget. That would create a
conflict between the exchange's fiduciary duty to stockholders and
its job regulating dealers and protecting investors.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Arthur
Levitt, has told NYSE officials and those at the NASDAQ market,
which is also mulling a public offering, that he is concerned that
a public company may not give the self-policing units enough
independence, unless those units are separated from the exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Grasso said any option that would satisfy Levitt will
be considered, including a regulatory subsidiary ``with a public
board, with accountability to both the board of the NYSE and to the
public user, in terms of transparency of the financing of that
entity.'' Such a structure would be similar to that of the
regulatory board of the National Association of Securities Dealers.
</P>
<P>
   But Grasso said a spinoff of the regulatory unit is another
possibility. That could be done by itself, or it could lead to a
merger of the unit with its NASD counterpart, a proposal that has
been offered by NASDAQ officials.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt said in a statement Thursday, ``We share a common
interest in ensuring that any future self-regulatory structure is
consistent with the protection of investors and the maintenance of
fair and orderly markets.'' SEC staffers have said they do not
expect the regulatory matter to be a ``major impediment'' to a
public offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Optimally, they should have a completely independent
regulatory unit, in terms of comforting the SEC and comforting
investors,'' said Alan Bromberg, a securities-law professor at
Southern Methodist University in Dallas. Such a separation ``may
not be absolutely necessary'' if the unit were given ``an
incredible degree of independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, he said, ``I think they're going to have an uphill
battle to convince people that the policemen are really there, if
the policemen are working for the boss.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Banking Committee expects to hold a hearing later
this month on the exchanges' plans to convert to public ownership.
</P>
<P>
   As contemplated, the initial public offering would give each of
the exchange's 1,366 seatholders a trading license and shares of
stock. Grasso said it has not been discussed whether the initial
public offering would raise money or simply allow members to sell
stock. Either way, having publicly traded stock would give the
exchange a currency it could use for acquisitions as it faces
increasing challenges from electronic trading networks, data
companies and other competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Grasso said it would be a few months before the exchange hears
from the IRS, which will decide whether the exchange of stock for
seats would be tax-free for the seatholders.
</P>
<P>
   But fears that an adverse IRS ruling would doom the spinoff may
evaporate soon, depending on action in Congress. According to
Robert Willens, managing director of tax and accounting issues at
Lehman Brothers, President Clinton's budget proposal includes a
provision allowing partial swaps of assets and rights for stock to
be tax free.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IRS could argue that because the members will retain the
right to trade on the exchange, the members have therefore
transferred less than all their rights, constituting a taxable
exchange,'' Willens said. But the Clinton proposal, introduced to
clarify the law after a court ruling challenged the IRS position,
could be passed this year. ``It would be a complete answer to their
problems,'' he said. ``Just a happy coincidence for them.''

U.S. OFFSHORE LAW-ENFORCEMENT ZONE IS DOUBLED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Coast Guard and federal law-enforcement
agencies will be allowed to enforce American law and board foreign
ships up to 24 nautical miles off the coast, doubling the current
range, the Clinton administration announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The move, which was ordered in a proclamation signed by
President Clinton, was hailed by environmentalists who say that it
should curtail rapacious fishing and pollution by foreign ships
operating off the American coast.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the decision, Vice President Al Gore said in a
speech in Boston that ``we can better protect America's working
families against drug trafficking, illegal immigration and threats
to our ocean environment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are putting would-be smugglers and polluters on notice that
we will do everything in our power to protect our waters and our
shores,'' said the vice president, who hopes to make environmental
protection a central issue in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's move has obvikus appeal to the American fishing
industry, which has long protested over the fishing practices of
foreign vessels, and to voters in coastal states.
</P>
<P>
   The United States claims territorial waters that extend 12
nautical miles, or about 13.8 common miles, from shore. Until
Thursday, the contiguous zone, or the area in which the United
States claims the right to enforce its laws, also extended out 12
nautical miles from the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Under Thursday's move, the United States will expand the area in
which it enforces its laws another 12 nautical miles.
</P>
<P>
   The new limits will allow the Coast Guard to board foreign
vessels _ without seeking the permission of the nations where they
are registered _ that come within 24 nautical miles of shore and
are believed to be smuggling drugs, carrying illegal immigrants,
polluting the oceans or violating other laws. Twenty-four nautical
miles is about 27.6 common miles.
</P>
<P>
   The limits will also apply to the waters around American
territories, including Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the
Virgin Islands and the North Mariana Islands in the central
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1980s, the United States had a territorial limit of
only three miles. Traditionally, the United States preferred
shorter territorial limits for all nations in part because of the
desire of the U.S. Navy and other elements of the military to have
close access to the shoreline of potential adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   A 1982 U.N. treaty, which was ratified by most members of the
United Nations but not by the United States, permits nations to
claim territorial waters up to 12 nautical miles from shore, and a
contiguous zone up to 24 nautical miles from shore. The United
States has now adopted those limits as its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's really good news, especially considering the
needs to have better enforcement of our fisheries management and
protected-species management,'' said Roger McManus, president of
the Center for Marine Conservation, an environmental group based in
Washington. ``This is also extremely important for law-enforcement
personnel who are charged with enforcing laws on drugs and illegal
immigration.''
</P>
<P>
   In his appearance Thursday at the New England Aquarium in
Boston, the vice president announced the creation of a special
panel overseen by the National Security Council and the Council on
Environmental Quality to coordinate federal policy on the oceans.
He also announced that the federal government would provide $5
million to assist New England fishermen harmed by the depletion of
fish off the East Coast.

 &HT;    Powertel wireless plan lets phones have two numbers
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One phone, two numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Powertel has introduced a service that lets customers use one
wireless phone for calls using different numbers _ and they don't
even have to be in the same area code, so long as the customer
chooses area codes covered by Powertel's 12-state system, including
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Some wireless companies have offered similar features before,
although Powertel introduces some distinctive elements. For
instance, the customer holds only one calling plan, and air time
for both numbers counts toward the same total.
</P>
<P>
   ``You draw the minutes for both lines from the same bucket,''
said Mark Dlugozima, product manager for Powertel.
</P>
<P>
   A BellSouth service requires the customer to buy two calling
plans. BellSouth lets the customer choose different plans _ say,
one for heavy use and the other for the minimum. ``You get two
lines and two buckets of minutes,'' said Robert Haulbrook, director
of marketing for BellSouth Mobility in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   For many travelers frequently using wireless phones, the better
idea may be a one-rate plan that lets users roam, Haulbrook said.
For example, BellSouth has a $90-a-month plan that includes 600
minutes of nationwide use. Powertel also has flat-rate plans _
cheaper per minute than BellSouth's, although BellSouth contends
that Powertel is linked to a less-complete national network.
Powertel offers 120 minutes per month for $30, 600 minutes for $60
and 800 minutes for $80.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Powertel argues that some people will prefer a
two-number, one-phone arrangement, which costs an extra $4 per
month.
</P>
<P>
   The notion is pitched mainly at small businesses and families
whose members are in different cities _ college students, for
instance. For a business, two area codes let the company ``appear
local'' to callers from another city who will, in turn, not have to
pay long-distance rates to connect.
</P>
<P>
   A college student coming home now and then would likewise not be
a long-distance call at school.
</P>
<P>
   Powertel is also introducing a $6-a-month, two-number feature
aimed at users who want to separate business and personal calls
when they look at the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Customers choosing a two-number feature can program the phones
so that each number has a distinctive ring. When a call comes in,
the phone rings, regardless of which line it's arriving on.
</P>
<P>
   The ideas come with wireless phones reaching ever more people
and packing ever more features. Newer phones are increasingly
carrying data transmission, including Internet access. In fact,
Powertel offers up to four lines on its phones, two for voice, one
for faxes and one for data, Dlugozima said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 70 million Americans now use wireless phones,
according to the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association.

FOR RAMON MARTINEZ, GOOD ARM IS A GOOD GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- If we can go by the early returns, it's pretty clear
this isn't going to be like 1934 when Dizzy and Paul Dean won 49
regular-season games for the Cardinals, then won all four games of
the World Series against the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   With 134 games down and 28 to play, the Red Sox have 19 wins
from Pedro Martinez and zero from Big Brother Ramon.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Thursday made his first big-league appearance since June
14, 1998, and it resulted in a 4-2 loss to the lowly Kansas City
Royals. Big Brother's comeback concert did not inspire memories of
Luis Tiant, Tom Seaver, Mike Boddicker, or other Red Sox veteran
hurlers who emerged after the All-Star break and buoyed the hopes
of the fandom down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon (is he the first starting pitcher whose first name is the
name of his shortstop spelled backward?) lasted three-plus innings
and gave up four runs (three earned) on five hits two walks and a
hit batsman. He threw 61 pitches, 34 for strikes and was yanked
after yielding two singles and a homer to the first three batters
in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't disappointed,'' said Ramon, who had rotator cuff
surgery last summer. ``I was disapointed with the result, a loss,
but it was a good outing for me. I don't feel any kind of pain. The
only problem I had was that I walked a couple of guys and that was
it. But it was exciting. I liked the way I was out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jimy Williams echoed the sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``His arm was free,'' said the manager. ``He had a real good
changeup. You could see the quality was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon needed only eight pitches to get out of the first inning,
1-2-3. When he fanned Carlos Beltran to end the perfect frame, fans
posted a Pedro K-Card on the back wall of the center-field
bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   The second inning was a test. Jermaine Dye led with a rocket
single off the Wall, then Ramon walked Dee Brown and Joe Randa to
load the bases with no outs. Pitching coach Joe Kerrigan came out
for a visit and Tim Wakefield started throwing in the bullpen. When
Martinez hit the next batter, it looked as if Ramon might get the
early hook, but he got out of the jam like the old master that he
is _ striking out Sal Fasano, getting Jed Hansen on a foul pop, and
fanning Johnny Damon. He threw 27 pitches in the second inning, 14
out of the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro got nervous when I got the bases loaded and no outs,''
said a smiling Ramon. ``I said, `hey, relax. I've been through that
before.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon bounced a couple of pitches, but was otherwise
consistently high, and appeared to be aiming the ball. In the
third, Ray Holbert led with a single to center, stole second, and
scored on a one-out Wall double by Dye. Martinez got out of that
jam, but the fourth was too much. After a single by No. 9 batter
Hansen, the third straight hit of the inning, Williams popped out
of the dugout and Scott Hatteberg switched mitts to prepare for
Wakefield.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon pointed to his heart as he came off the mound, then went
to the dugout, accepted some handshakes, and sat down next to his
younger brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to get back out there and pitch a better game than
I did today,'' he said. ``But it was my first game in over a year
and there were a lot of things on my mind out there. I feel good I
was able to go back out there and pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox have a pretty big decision to make regarding Ramon's
next start. The season is shrinking and they can ill afford any
more three-inning, four-run stints of a rehab nature. They are
lucky Wakefield is flexible, but can Boston afford to start Ramon
next week in Oakland?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to evaluate,'' said Jimywocky. ``I'm not going to make
that decision now. Wakefield pitched good, too. We're not into
tryout camps. I think Ramon pitched good enough to start again, so
I'm hedging. I'm on that fence. I guess I'm glad I've got my cup
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan said, ``We have to make a decision tomorrow. The only
way we can pitch him is to start him because it takes him so long
to warm up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon took the high road. ``I feel ready for my next start, but
I will respect whatever decision Jimy makes,'' he said. ``We're in
a pennant race, but if he wants me to go out again I go.''
</P>
<P>
   Big Brother says he will respect whatever decision Jimy makes.
He must have borrowed that attitude from Pedro.

 &HT;    Judge in Coke bias suit concerned about secrecy, issues a
warning
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The federal judge in the Coca-Cola racial
discrimination lawsuit declined to dramatically change his order
protecting the company's documents, but he expressed concern at the
volume of files being stamped ``confidential.''
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' lawyers had complained that Coca-Cola was abusing
U.S. District Judge Richard Story's order governing what documents
can be made public. The attorneys said Coca-Cola so far has
indiscriminately marked as confidential virtually all of the 32,000
pages of documents the company has turned over to the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit, four current and former employees accuse the
company of discriminating against African-American workers in pay,
promotions and performance evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola strongly denies the allegations in the suit, which
seeks class-action status.
</P>
<P>
   During a pretrial fact-finding process called discovery, both
sides are required to turn over documents to each other. Under
Story's protective order, documents marked confidential by either
party cannot be made public.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the order, Story said either party could designate as
confidential such documents that contain ``commercial information''
or ``individual personal information.''
</P>
<P>
   In a motion filed in July, the plaintiffs asked Story to revise
his order to ``curtail the actual or potential abuse'' of it by
requiring the side that's seeking secrecy to justify its actions,
and they asked the judge to more narrowly define what areas can be
deemed confidential. Story declined to grant either request.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court is concerned that Coca-Cola has designated as
confidential a large number of documents it has produced,'' Story
said in an order issued this week. ``If Coca-Cola abuses the
privilege of designating confidential information,'' the judge
indicated he will revisit the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Story did modify his order in one respect by allowing the
disclosure of confidential information during court proceedings.
But he said any party seeking to present such information in court
must first inform the opposing party and the judge so a procedure
protecting confidentiality can be agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
   The limitations set out in his protective order, Story said,
``are intended to be strictly construed. ... Simply because
information may not be favorable to a party is not a reason for
designating it confidential.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the data reflecting the employment of minorities at
Coca-Cola will be part of the evidence in the case and subject to
public dissemination, Story noted.
</P>
<P>
   Story said he entered the protective order to prevent
confidential disclosures that may harm the company as well as the
plaintiffs. He added that he is ``especially mindful'' of the
public's interest in employment discrimination litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public's confidence in the judicial process is directly
related to information made available to the public about that
process,'' he wrote. ``Therefore, every effort must be made to
disseminate to the public information relevant to these
proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   Cyrus Mehri, the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, said of Story's
order, ``We are pleased the court gave the parties guidance on this
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola spokesman Ben Deutsch said the company had no comment.

Reno, in a dramatic standoff with Republican critics, had gone

<P>
   ``I wanted and received assurances that the gas and its means of
use were not pyrotechnic,'' Reno said in a jammed House hearing
room before a panel considered the most partisan in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, after six years of insisting the government did
nothing to start the blaze at Mount Carmel where cult leader David
Koresh and about 80 of his followers, including 20 children,
perished, Reno acknowledged that she was ``very troubled'' by new
information she had received that pyrotechnic devices may have been
used.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very, very upset,'' Reno said. ``I don't think it's very
good for my credibility. That's the reason I'm going to pursue it
until I get to the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday evening the Justice Department seized a previously
undisclosed infrared videotape recorded during the early morning of
April 19, 1993, that indicates FBI agents obtained permission to
lob pyrotechnic tear-gas canisters at a concrete bunker about 40
yards from the Davidians' compound.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials described Reno as furious over the
FBI's belated discovery of the videotape, made by FBI surveillance
aircraft using infrared radar. An audio track on the tape contained
the agent's request, and his boss' permission, to use the military
tear-gas rounds hours several hours before the cult compound went
up in flames.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout from Reno's acknowledgement and the storm of
revelations that have followed it, have reignited passions in
Congress, rekindled calls for her ouster, and again raised
questions about the credibility of the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   At least three congressional committees are taking another look
at the 51-day siege and Reno is expected to name an outside
investigator today to examine why Reno and other ranking Justice
Department officials were never told that the pyrotechnic tear-gas
canisters were used.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the attorney general cannot manage to find and tell the
truth about a matter as important as the Waco incident, she should
step aside and give someone else a chance,'' Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, said, adding his voice to the chorus of lawmakers
demanding Reno's ouster.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI now admits it used M651 tear gas canisters in the
assault, but still contends that the fire that destroyed the
compound was started by the Branch Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and the FBI have said agents lobbed the military tear gas
canisers at the bunker hours before the Davidians' wooden building
was engulfed in flames.
</P>
<P>
   The move to end the siege by storming Mount Carmel has long been
the focus of criticism from Republicans on Capitol Hill and from
anti-government groups nationwide. Lawmakers, including House
Government Reform Committee Chairman Dan Burton, R-Ind., have
accused Justice officials of ``sitting on this evidence for six
years, all the while maintaining that it didn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Janet Reno owes us an explanation,'' said Rep. Kay
Granger, R-Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's most complete explanation to date has come in
congressional hearings in both 1993 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The 51-day standoff was, in fact, already under way when Reno
took office March 12, 1993, and she began getting briefings from
the FBI on the matter that same day.
</P>
<P>
   She said in testimony that it was former FBI Director William
Sessions who first suggested the use of tear gas to end the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   During the week of April 5, 1993, two weeks before the final
attack, she met with Sessions, former FBI deputy directors Floyd
Clark and Larry Potts, and former FBI official Doug Gow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was briefed in all details about everything that had been
done up to that point in trying to resolve the matter peacefully,''
she said in testimony in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went through it in detail. Then I started asking questions.
What about the gas? Would it be harmful to the children? I had real
concern about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pointed out to me that the gas was non-lethal.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she requested that Sessions study the safety issue
further and that the FBI officials suggested she meet with Harry
Salem, a top toxicology expert who was the Army's leading expert on
tear gas. Salem told Reno that the plan to use tear gas could not
lead to injury.
</P>
<P>
   She would later meet with Col. William G. Boykin, then commander
of the Delta Force, and Brig. Gen. Peter J. Schoomaker, then the
assistant division commander of the 1st Cavalry Division at Fort
Hood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their comments were instructive,'' Reno said. ``While
indicating that the plan appeared sound, one suggestion was that
rather than an incremental approach to use, as proposed by the FBI,
that gas should be inserted into all portions of the compound
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I preferred the FBI approach. It seemed to me that that would
be best to ensure the safety of those inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno went on to say, and has always contended, that she approved
the use of tear gas against the compound because the two sides had
reached an impasse, the difficulty of keeping the perimeter of the
compound secure, and the refusal of the remaining Davidians to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   She approved the operation on Saturday, April 17. The plan was
to insert gas periodically over a two-day period, beginning the
following Monday, the day Mount Carmel burned to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has denied any knowledge of the FBI's use of the
pyrotechnic tear gas canisters exposed on the seized videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Sage, a retired FBI official who acted as chief negotiator
in Waco, said that the tape, found at the FBI crime lab in
Quantico, Va., probably was lost in the mass of evidence the FBI
has relating to the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no sinister plot here and, ultimately, the tape
itself substantiates what the FBI has been confirming all along as
to the actions that day, which ultimately did not contribute one
way or another to the fire started by the Davidians.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Caddell, who has filed a multimillion-dollar federal
wrongful death lawsuit on behalf of nearly 200 Davidians and their
relatives, said the tape is evidence of a cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that the government has not been forthcoming about
what happened at Waco,'' he said. ``There are people who clearly
knew about the existence of this tape. Somebody loaded those
pyrotechnics, somebody fired them on the morning of April 19th, and
those people have been remained silent for the last six years.''

A TOUGH DAY AT THE OFFICE FOR FANG LI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The US Open's girl next door has lost. In 66 minutes,
another major championship was over for the hometown hopeful, and
she got in her car and took the 5-minute drive home. She said her
husband would have a nice lunch waiting for her. Chinese. She
particularly likes his steamed-and-fried chicken wings.
</P>
<P>
   She describes him as an ``all-purpose'' husband _ ``cook, coach,
hitting partner, traveling companion, the other things.''
</P>
<P>
   When you're a young lady on the road most of your life, a roomie
for all seasons and reasons comes in mighty handy. But for now Fang
Li, the greatest professional tennis player in the history of the
Peoples Republic of China, is home in Flushing. The US Open is her
favorite tournament, even though she's won only two matches in
eight tries since 1992. ``It is nice to be home, sleep in our own
bed.''
</P>
<P>
   As the neighborhood's lone representative in its foremost annual
occasion, she had a rough-time second rounder Thursday on the paved
Meadow of Flushing. Falling behind world No. 11 Julie
Halard-Decugis of France, almost immediately, 2-0, Fang Li never
caught up and was beaten, 6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Did any of her fellow Flushingians know she was their tennis
poster gal _ or grumble, ``There goes the neighborhood!'' when a
tennis player moved in? Doubtful. A mere sprinkling of customers
from the record gathering of 28,192, were witnesses at Court 11.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it's likely that more people watched that match
than will check in by television across the US for the
championships. ``It was live on Star TV, and will be repeated
Friday morning,'' says a spokesman for that network. ``We go into
Asia, principally India and China. Hundreds of millions may have
seen Fang Li.''
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for a dictatorial Chinese politician named Mao
Zedong, Feng Li might be the best-known product of the steel
milling city of Xian Tan in Hunan Province. ``Chairman Mao and
me,'' she laughs. ``So everybody in China knows the place _ most
for him. I visit his home, where he's born, when I'm a school kid.
A small farmer's house in the country, outside town.''
</P>
<P>
   Completing the circuit, on another traditional school trip, she
also visited the Chairman at his present residence, the elaborate
mausoleum in Beijing where, under glass, he stiffly holds court.
</P>
<P>
   Flushing is home to a sizable Chinese community. ``Many good
restaurants, as good as Hong Kong,'' she boosts her adopted
hometown. Better than husband Jin Cheng Zhang's wok work? She
smiles, ``He's very good, but they're professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   Like her 26-year-old self, in a 10th campaign. She has ranked as
high as No. 36 (last year), but dropped to her present No. 94
because knee surgery earlier in the year cost her several months
off the tour.
</P>
<P>
   Letting her dark hair down to well below her shoulders after
playing, Fang Li is saying that she'll rise again ``now that my
knee is OK.'' Her English is better than serviceable, and her
situation, US domiciled, is fine with the government. Not like that
of another Flushing resident, Li Hongzhi, the fugitive founder of
the recently outlawed Falungong religious cult.
</P>
<P>
   She smiles good naturedly that she doesn't want to talk about
such things, or Taiwan. ``I play for my country, Federation Cup and
the Olympics. We like the US. We live here four years with my
brother-in-law's family because it's much easier to travel. Many
more tournaments in this part of the world than Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Fang Li, playing conventional baseline stuff, doesn't chop with
her tennis sticks. In this Year of the Rabbit, she hasn't fully
recovered the speed that has been a strong asset. Maybe next year,
the Year of the Dragon, she'll snort fire and reassert herself in
the rankings, thus qualifying for the Olympics. ``That's my goal,
the Olympics in Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   She's happy with her brief Open. An opening-round win over
Bulgarian Pavlina Stoyanova assured her of second-round prize
money, $19,000. That's her heaviest check during a career that has
amounted to about $500,000 in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   She couldn't have imagined that as a steel mill laborer's
daughter in Xian Tan. But one lucky day, her third year in school,
8-year-old Fang Li impressed a government tennis coach named Xie
Feng Sen. ``She gave the class some tests. Running, movement,
athletic things, and select me to take tennis training. She was my
coach until I turn pro.''
</P>
<P>
   Jin Cheng Zhang took over when they were married. They met as
members of the national team, but she doesn't say if it was love at
first bite of his cooking.
</P>
<P>
   The People's Republic hasn't been a breeding ground of tennis
pros. Previous best was Hu Na, a woman who defected to the United
States in 1982, made it to No. 58 five years later, and is in New
York herself as a Taiwanese telecaster.
</P>
<P>
   Fang Li hadn't known that her townsman, Mao, was also a tennis
player, a hacker. Edgar Snow, in his biography of the Chairman,
reported that Mao and comrades played in camp when the Red Army hid
out in Shaanxi Province, readying to take over China. They did
until a goat ended his career by eating the net. Fortunately there
are no goats at the Meadow called Flushing.

POOR (Phoenix) - The Center for Immigration Studies in Washington
is releasing a report that Arizona has the highest rate of
immigrant poverty in the country _ more than 40 percent of the
population. They used the national figure of a family of four
making less than $16,000 as being in poverty. The people at the
Center say this is interesting because the poverty rate statewide
has stayed about the same. They attribute it to a huge amount of
immigration to the state coupled with increasing job competition.

BROWN (Phoenix) - Former California Gov. Jerry Brown, now the mayor

Paolo Solari, the builder of Arcosanti. Brown wants help designing
a 10,000-person village in downtown Oakland. Brown's aim is to
revitalize that East Bay community by creating a place where people
can live and work without commuting, and enabling the conservation
of open space. Those goals are the hallmark of Solari's philosophy
about creating `archologies'' - urban environments for people that
pose the least impact on the natural environment and enable people
to enjoy open spaces near where they live and work. By MIKE MCCLOY.

 &HT;    Women PC users can `try on' Macy's clothes
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A little shy about trying on that bathing suit at your
local department store?
</P>
<P>
   Software maker Broderbund and Macy's have developed software
that allows women to create a three-dimensional model of themselves
that can be fitted with the department store's clothing.
</P>
<P>
   According to Broderbund spokeswoman Andrea Kroger, users enter
their measurements after loading the $49.99 software onto their
computers. Clothing selections from Macy's come preloaded, allowing
the ``model'' to strut different styles and sizes for a 360-degree
inspection by the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   The ``fittings'' are done offline. Afterward, the user connects
to Macy.com through her Internet service provider if she wants to
place an online order for the clothing.
</P>
<P>
   The software, which is called Cosmopolitan Fashion Makeover
Deluxe and is available only to PC users, even allows a user to
attach her face onto the model. Users get free seasonal updates on
styles, and fashion tips are provided by Cosmopolitan magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Kroger said the product will be in software stores by the end of
September. While Broderbund says its software is the most advanced
of its kind, Ken Cassar, an analyst with Jupiter Communication's
Digital Commerce Group in New York, said several retailers either
currently offer or have plans for similar products.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, consumers who go to Land's End's Web site can
build their own personal model and then try on clothes offered in
the catalog. Shoppers can check those clothes they want to try on
and then send them back to a virtual dressing room. Then, with
selections made, the shopper can try on the clothes _ virtually, of
course. But sizes are limited, and the models aren't
three-dimensional. ``The real question is whether consumer will pay
$49.99 to be marketed to by Macy's,'' Cassar said. ``It sounds like
a tool that has the same intent as other tools that are being
offered on Web sites for free.

MOST RETAIL CHAINS POST STRONG SALES FOR AUGUST 
</HEADLINE>

Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling (888)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Attracted by trendy fashion items like inflatable dorm room
furniture and embroidered blue jeans, back-to-school shoppers
helped propel retailers to another strong month in August.
</P>
<P>
   Sales in stores open at least a year, a crucial industry
measurement, rose 5.1 percent in August, according to the Goldman,
Sachs retail composite index. While strong, the growth was a little
slower than the torrid pace of the first half of this year.
Analysts said the numbers indicated the beginning of a consumer
slowdown, but nothing severe. ``We have gone from a boom to what
you might describe as the next notch down,'' said Richard Burner,
chief U.S. economist with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``But the
fundamentals are still very good.''
</P>
<P>
   George Strachan, vice president of retail investment research
with Goldman, Sachs, agreed. ``Right now we are running among the
best results in 20 years if you take out last year's exceptional
numbers,'' he said. ``The consumer is still very healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the overall good news, shares of most retailers ended
the day down, largely driven by unexpected bad news from Sears,
Roebuck &AMP; Co. The retailer reported August sales rose 0.1 percent
but also said Thursday that it was lowering earnings expectations
for the third quarter to between 63 cents and 67 cents a share.
Analysts had expected Sears to earn 82 cents a share, according to
a survey by First Call Corp. Shares of Sears fell $3.6875, to a
52-week low of $33.50.
</P>
<P>
   The retailer, based in Hoffman Estates, Ill., blamed softness in
apparel sales and lower than-expected margins because of heavy
price cutting for the decline in earnings. ``We are selling a lot
of merchandise, but not at full price. Even new products were
coming in and being promoted very quickly,'' said a spokeswoman for
Sears, Peggy Palter.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the problems at Sears were not a reflection of a
slowing economy but a confirmation of the company's longstanding
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The lowered estimate was announced in conjunction with a
shake-up of top management.
</P>
<P>
   Sears Credit president Alan Lacy will also oversee the company's
home services and e-commerce businesses. Julian Day, who has been
chief financial officer since March, has been named to the newly
created position of executive vice president and chief operating
officer responsible for finance as well as logistics and
information technology. Lacy and Day will join Sears chairman and
chief executive Arthur Martinez in a newly formed office of the
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Robert Mettler, the company's head of merchandising,
resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Several other department stores also fared poorly in August.
J.C. Penney Stores reported that sales in stores open a year
declined 3.2 percent, a slide that was greater than anticipated.
Similarly Mervyn's and its parent, Dayton-Hudson Corp., had
slightly larger than expected negative sales numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The discounters, which have remained strong recently, seemed to
get even stronger as the rest of the retail sector pulled back a
bit. ``The dichotomy just got exacerbated for August,'' said Jeff
Feiner, a retail analyst with Lehman Brothers. ``On balance the
consumer recognizes in the price-value equation, value just got
more important.''
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart Stores posted a very muscular 8.7 percent gain that
came on top of a very strong 7.6 percent increase in sales in
August of 1998. Target, the discount unit that makes up in excess
of 75 percent of the revenue at Dayton-Hudson, saw sales shoot up
6.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Eich, a company spokeswoman, said the fashionable
discounter had done particularly well in fun home furnishings, like
the ``furry Cousin It lamp,'' for the college bound set, but that
sales for younger children were still to come. ``Ten years ago a
mom would do one big trip and now a lot of parents are waiting
until their kids are in school and seeing what other children are
wearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick-and-easy fashion statements were also on the minds of
consumers. Specialty chains whose forte is a style statement for
consumers did well this month. Ann Taylor was up 9 percent in
August. American Eagle Outfitters rose 24 percent, on top of a very
tough 28.4 percent sales growth in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In what is turning out to be the turn-around story of the year,
The Limited Inc., whose subsidiaries include Express, Lane Bryant
and Lerner and which owns 80 percent of Intimates Brands, the owner
of Victoria's Secret, posted an impressive companywide gain of 12
percent last month.
</P>
<P>
   The real disappointment in the specialty-store category came
from Gap Inc. Although the company posted very respectable sales
growth of 8 percent, that number was powered by explosive returns
at its Banana Republic and Old Navy divisions. The Gap Stores,
which account for some 40 percent to 45 percent of Gap Inc.'s
revenue, actually saw sales decline 4 percent to 7 percent, while
Banana Republic rose 14 percent to 17 percent and Old Navy jumped
17 percent to 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weakness was in the Gap core business of basics,'' said
Warren Hashagen, senior vice president for international finance,
``the fashion business was stronger than expected, but we just did
not have enough merchandise.'' He said Gap was working on
``adjusting the assortment'' for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Gap have been down in recent months, but analysts are
confident the chain will work through its problems and they have
great faith in the track record of its chief executive, Millard S.
Drexler. ``I give management the benefit of the doubt because The
Gap has been most adept and creating and recreating brands,'' said
Maura Hunter Byrne, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney.

ROYALS SPOIL RAMON MARTINEZ' DEBUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Maybe next time, Ramon. It is still too soon to count
on yet another pitcher named Martinez to play a major role in the
Red Sox' bid to make the American League playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the older brother of Boston ace Pedro Martinez
pitched well enough in his AL debut to merit another look before
the Red Sox return home from a 10-game, four-city swing to Seattle,
Oakland, New York, and Cleveland. Hopefully, there will be more
support from his teammates than he received Thursday in a 4-2 loss
to Kansas City at Fenway Park in the finale of a seven-game
homestand. The Sox had won the first six.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with the A's 9-3 loss to the Yankees, the Sox remain two
games ahead of Oakland in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Funny how things can change in a week. Only last Thursday, the
Sox were in a quandry about whether to rush Ramon, 31, into the
rotation or make a trade to fill a slot created by an injury to
veteran Bret Saberhagen. As it turned out, they did both. Trades
brought starter Kent Mercker and reliever Rod Beck to Boston and
Martinez was activated, mostly to determine how far along he is in
his recovery from shoulder surgery. Now they have a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows where we are,'' said Sox manager Jimy
Williams, who made the decision to give Martinez his first start
since June 8, 1998. ``We have to evaluate. To me Ramon pitched
good. But don't forget he's in the same slot with Tim Wakefield and
we're not into tryout camps. That doesn't mean he's not going to
pitch. I think Ramon pitched good enough to start again, so I'm
hedging. I'm on that fence.''
</P>
<P>
   The return of Martinez Thursday was a 61-pitch adventure that a
crowd of 31,387 was eager to witness but fearful of the
consequences. Ramon gave up four runs, walked two, and allowed five
hits, which is the bad news. The good news is the long fluid motion
and the velocity was also present. When healthy, Ramon Martinez is
almost as good as . . . his brother. Well, he might be one day. The
Red Sox don't seem worried. Neither does Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very exciting,'' he said. ``I'm back and I will try to
do better next time. I felt a little weird from not being there for
a long time. I'll be ready for my next start. But I will go by
whatever decision Jimy makes. We're in a pennant race. If he wants
me to be out there again, I'll be out there. It's different from
when you pitch in the minors. We're in a pennant race. You're not
allowed to make mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Royals Thursday got good pitching from righthander Mac
Suzuki, and even better pitching out of relievers Tim Byrdak and
Chris Fussell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hit some balls good today,'' said Williams. ``But it's not
reflected in the score and the number of hits we got. That's the
way this game goes. They jumped out in front and scored four. We
couldn't come back, so you tip your cap to their pitchers and their
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had only one easy inning, the first, in which he
retired the first three hitters on only eight pitches. Things went
from bad to worse in the second and third innings when Kansas City
scored single runs. Matrinez's control vanished in a 27-pitch
second inning. He wilted in the fourth, giving up two more runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first inning I was focused and excited,'' said
Martinez. ``I said, `Let's go right at them.' The second inning I
was just OK. In the third and fourth I went out there and kind of
had too much confidence. I forgot a few of the little things.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez gave up a leadoff single in the second to Jermaine Dye
and then loaded the bases on walks to Dee Brown and Joe Randa. The
first run came home when Martinez hit Joe Vitiello with a pitch. In
the third, Martinez threw only 14 pitches. Ray Holbert hit a
leadoff single. Carlos Beltran lined to right. Then after Holbert
stole second, Dye came through with a run-scoring double.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's day ended abruptly after 12 pitches in the fourth
inning. Vitiello led off with a single and catcher Sal Fasano
followed with a home run into the left-field screen, his first of
the season. That gave Kansas City a 4-0 lead it never relinquished.
Martinez exited in favor of Wakefield after he gave up a single to
No. 9 hitter Jed Hansen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ramon just had the one inning when his control kind of left
him,'' said Williams. ``He got out of that even though he had the
bases loaded and one run was already in. He struggled. But you see
the quality is there. He knows how to pitch. His arm looked free.
That's what we were looking for.''

CELLUCI NAMES TWO VETERAN JURISTS TO HIGH COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Praising their conservative views and ``uncommon good
sense,'' Governor Paul Cellucci nominated two battle-tested former
prosecutors to the state's highest court Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In his first step toward reshaping the court, Cellucci said
Superior Court Judge Judith A. Cowin and Appeals Court Justice
Francis X. Spina would bring intellectual depth and real world
experience to the Supreme Judicial Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each is an impressive individual who has been tested in the
crucible of the courtroom,'' Cellucci said before a crowd of
lawyers and judges at the State House. ``Each has been called upon
to make decisions about constitutional questions balancing the
rights of defendants, the rights of victims, and the interests of
the community so that justice is served.
</P>
<P>
   Cowin, 57, a Republican who has been active in party circles, is
a former Norfolk County prosecutor. Spina, 52, who is from
Pittsfield, is a Democrat, was an assistant district attorney in
Berkshire County.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said both come with strong backgrounds in the courtroom
as judges, defenders, and prosecutors who have been involved in
difficult and complicated criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   Cowin presided over the highly charged homicide case involving
two men convicted in the murder of 10-year-old Jeffrey Curley of
Cambridge in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said both nominees embrace conservative legal
positions, and support his criminal justice initiatives,
particulary minimum mandatory sentences, truth in sentencing, and
juvenile justice reform.
</P>
<P>
   Both Spina and Cowin said they support the use of the death
penalty for first degree murder cases and said capital punishment
is allowed under the state constitution.
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci said he did not use the death penalty as a defining
issue in making the judicial appointments.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to his nomination of associate SJC justice Margaret
Marshall, who is a death penalty opponent, as chief justice last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no litmus test,'' Cellucci said, who interviewed
finalists for the two vacancies along with Lieutenant Governor Jane
Swift.
</P>
<P>
   Spina and Cowin will replace former Chief Justice Herbert
Wilkins, who reached the mandatory retirement age of 70 last month,
and Charles Fried, a 1995 appointee, who left the bench in June to
return to his teaching post at Harvard Law School.
</P>
<P>
   With two more SJC justices -- Ruth I. Abrams and Neil L. Lynch
-- scheculed to retire next year, Cellucci will have appointed four
of the seven members of the court and have chosen the next chief
justice in the first two years of his term.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whom they viewed as their role models on the SJC,
Cowin chose Fried, known for his outspoken conservative views.
Spina said he most admired associate justice John Greaney, a fellow
native of western Massachusetts who was appointed in 1989 by then
Governor Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   Cowin was appointed to the Superior Court by former governor
William F. Weld, and has been active in the past in state GOP
circles.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, she was a staff aide to former US Senator Edward
Brooke. Her husband, William Cowin, served in top posts in the
Sargent administraiton in the early 1970's, and was chosen by the
party to run for lieutenant governor in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, pointing to his appointment of Cowin and elevation of
Marshall, touted his record of appointing women to the bench. He
said 40 percent of his judicial nominees have been females. He said
10 percent are racial minorities, a figure he said is too low and
that he plans to recruit minority candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Legal observers said Cellucci's choices are strong signals that
the governor intends to appoint judges who have experience in the
courtrooms from all perspectives, a sharp departure, they say, from
the more academic nominees appointed by his predecessor William F.
Weld.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Weld appointments were prosecutorial while Cellucci
is obviously turning to people who have a far broader sense of the
real world, with more balanced life experience,'' said Thomas E.
Dwyer Jr., president of the Boston Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer, who active in state and national Democratic circles, also
praised Cellucci for ``obviously focusing on judges who have both
experience and an understanding of the fraility of human nature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Cellucci has decided the best thing he could for his
legacy is to look for the best possible people and put ideology
aside,'' Dwyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The sentiments were echoed by Martin Healy, general counsel of
the Massachusetts Bar Association, who praised the governor's
choices for the court, saying both Cowin and Spina have ``strong
legal practical backgrounds'' that would allow them to balance the
interest of criminal and defendants.

MELODIOUS SOUNDS OF STEEL DRUMS AS LABOR DAY CARNIVAL APPROACHES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating to delete photo note)  (dal) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ From Port of Spain in Trinidad to London to Miami,
the exultant sound of the steel drum band rings across carnivals
and continents. Formed anew every Carnival season, giant steel-drum
(or ``pan'') bands rehearse daily for months to perform a short
piece before enthusiastic crowds and tough competition judges.
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn the sound of steel drums grows more vibrant with
each week of the summer, as pan bands a hundred musicians strong
gather on sidewalks and in vacant lots, practicing every night to
prevail in the annual competition that ushers in Brooklyn's giant
Labor Day West Indian American carnival. Along with Trinidad's own
Carnival in February, Brooklyn's is one of the two epicenters of
pan music.
</P>
<P>
   To increase their competitive chances, bands call on a handful
of world-class arrangers whose job is to turn amateurs into
virtuosos with razzle-dazzle versions of the year's calypso
favorites. Year after year bands turn to Len (Boogsie) Sharpe.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe, 45, has been renowned in steel-drum music for 40 years,
from his days as a prodigy who could barely reach the drum to his
emergence as a composer, arranger and band leader. He uses the most
traditional methods to create startling, innovative arrangements
for the instrument that has become the musical symbol of the West
Indies. Since the mid-1980s he has often competed with himself,
working for multiple bands in a single Panorama competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boogsie is head and shoulders above everybody else,'' said Bob
Telson, the composer of Broadway's ``Gospel at Colonus,'' who often
draws on world music.
</P>
<P>
   This year Sharpe is the mastermind for the Pan Rebels steel
band, named after a song he wrote in 1983. On Monday night in
Brooklyn, steel drums pealed down Parkside Avenue in Flatbush, as
the Pan Rebels warmed up for one of their last rehearsals before
Saturday's competition. The tinsel-trimmed scaffolding that holds
the drums had been rolled out of the band's headquarters, a
deserted garage across the street from Intermediate School 2, and
nearly a hundred drummers were taking their places on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   The musicians, most of them with roots in Trinidad and Tobago,
included an 8-year-old girl and men in their 60s; dreadlocked
teen-agers and working women in their 30s; teachers, carpenters,
salesmen, plumbers. Limbering up, they bent over their drums with
rubber-tipped mallets and bits of calypso melody filled the air
with a random, shimmering clangor. The sidewalk had become a
panyard, a steel-band practice area. At around 9:30 p.m. Sharpe
strolled into the ranks of drums and tapped a syncopated beat on
the side of one with a drumstick.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly chaos gave way to harmony: Sharpe's arrangement of a
calypso called ``In My House,'' 10 minutes of flashy variations,
full of ping-ponging counterpoint and vertiginous key changes. It
was the kind of showpiece _ bursting with melodies,
countermelodies, stops and starts _ that has made Sharpe's
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   And it sounded like liquid jubilation. People from the
neighborhood gathered on the sidewalk to listen; cars along
Parkside crawled by with their windows open, reluctant to drive
away from the music. Caribbean food vendors opened up stands,
selling corn soup and roti and sorrel-scented beer; they've been
doing business since July, when the Pan Rebels and two other steel
bands started nightly rehearsals on Parkside Avenue. The brisk
calypso beat, tapped out on salvaged brake shoes, set both drummers
and listeners dancing.
</P>
<P>
   The Pan Rebels were polishing ``In My House,'' a tribute to
steel drums by the songwriter Oba, for Panorama, which takes place
Saturday night behind the Brooklyn Museum of Art on Eastern
Parkway. The Pan Rebels will be judged alongside 13 other bands.
About 24 hours after the Panorama judges announce their decisions,
the Pan Rebels and the other steel bands will march in Jouvert, the
parade of satirical costumes and steel bands that gets under way at
3 a.m. Monday on Grand Army Plaza in Prospect Heights and makes its
way to Nostrand Avenue in Wingate until mid-morning. Jouvert
(pronounced Joo-VAY) is a grass-roots revival of an old Trinidadian
custom. With or without sleep, some of the steel bands go on to
perform in the Eastern Parkway carnival parade, which draws more
than a million spectators every year.
</P>
<P>
   For all the bands Labor Day weekend is the culmination of two
months of practicing, night after night, often until 2 or 3 a.m.
The musicians are unpaid, but they willingly sustain the tradition.
``People lose jobs, wives, everything because of their love for
this,'' said Gary Rogers, one of the Pan Rebels' three
coordinators.
</P>
<P>
   When Trinidad was used as a refueling stop for aircraft carriers
during World War II, the islanders recycled empty oil barrels as
drums. African drums were banned in Trinidad in 1884 by British
colonial rulers, and for half a century carnival processions made
music from bamboo tubes called tamboo bamboo, along with biscuit
tins, bottles and scrap iron.
</P>
<P>
   Steel drums brought a new precision and refinement to carnival
music. Hammering various-sized dents in the tops of the barrels
made it possible to play different notes on a steel drum, and in a
few years Trinidadians devised an orchestral range of instruments,
from the tenor pans that usually carry the melody down to bass pans
with only a few deep notes on each drum.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe, 45, has made the tradition his calling. ``Pan is my
life. It's all I know,'' he said. ``I live music, sleep music, eat
music. Sometimes, when I am playing, I just feel like my whole body
and soul is inside of the pan.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe does not read or write music. Neither do most of steel
drummers. But in a feat of memory that Trinidadians take for
granted, he conceives elaborate arrangements and teaches them to
the drummers note by note, phrase by phrase. He does not sketch the
music on a keyboard, as some steel-band arrangers do; he doesn't
use recordings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the whole picture in my head,'' he said. The music
exists only in Sharp's imagination, and then in the sound of
mallets on steel.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe was born in a panyard in Port of Spain, where his cousin
led a steel band. He had perfect pitch and was immediately drawn to
music. When he saw symphony orchestras on television, he wanted to
become a conductor. But steel drums were closer at hand, and at the
age of 3, he was tapping out melodies. ``The pan was taller than
me,'' he recalled; he stood on a cinderblock.
</P>
<P>
   Recognized as a prodigy, he started winning prizes when he was
5, and he put together a band to play his first compositions while
he was a schoolboy. At 15, Sharpe dropped out to join the Starlift
Band, the first steel band to play its own compositions instead of
transcriptions. And at 20 he founded his own band, Phase II Pan
Groove, which he still leads in Trinidad's original Panorama during
the February carnival.
</P>
<P>
   It was more than a decade before Phase II won first prize at
Panorama in Trinidad. In 1987 Sharpe became the first arranger to
win the competition with his own composition, ``This Feeling
Nice.'' By then, he was widely recognized as an innovator in
steel-band music.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can do things that are very modern and still keep an
old-time calypso feel in the harmonies and the phrasing of the
melodies,'' said Telson, who has performed with Sharpe's bands in
Trinidad and Brooklyn. ``His chords are much richer than anyone
else's, and his counterpoint is also deeper than anyone else's. He
has so many countermelodies happening that although the music is
harmonically so rich, you can also focus on any one of three
different lines at the same time. And it always swings.''
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1980s Sharpe was being commissioned to create
arrangements for other bands as well as Phase II. His tunes, with
lyrics added by various collaborators, became hits for the singer
Denyse Plummer. Sharpe's peak as a prize winner came in 1988, when
he supplied seven different bands with arrangements. Three of them
won regional awards for the north, east and south zones, another
arrangement was a winner for Tobago, and Phase II won the national
prize.
</P>
<P>
   More recently Pan Trinbago, which runs Panorama in Trinidad,
decreed that no more than two bands in the main competition can use
the same arranger, and Sharpe said he has heard that the number may
be cut to one.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is unfair,'' he said. ``You can't tell a lawyer how many
clients to have, and you can't tell a doctor how many patients to
see. Why are they trying to deprive me of my livelihood?''
</P>
<P>
   Outside carnival season Sharpe works in clubs, playing steel
drum with leading calypso singers and jazz musicians, from the
Mighty Sparrow and David Rudder to Wynton Marsalis, Randy Weston
and Art Blakey. His current schedule includes an Oct. 17 concert at
Afrika House in Brooklyn, playing a tribute to the calypso composer
Lord Kitchener with a small group. And he has just released a
pop-jazz album, ``Fresh Air,'' on his own label. He would be happy,
he said, to compose soundtracks for movies and television.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile steel-band jobs keep Sharpe in motion. His home is in
Miami, where he leads a band for the carnival on Columbus Day
weekend. Around the end of November he goes to stay with his mother
in Trinidad, relaxing until the day after Christmas, when he begins
serious work on carnival pieces for Trinidad's Panorama; an
arrangement for a top Trinidadian band may bring him $5,000 for the
two-month process. In spring he arranges steel-band music at
Disneyland in California. And he spends July and August in the
panyards of Brooklyn, shaping his latest arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't come with anything planned, I do it all on the spot,''
he said. ``I have the melody in my head, I hear the chords that go
with it, and I hear the bass that goes with it. I teach the tenor
the melody, and teach the bass, and then I put all the inside music
in. I'm adding a piece, a piece, a piece. I use a little jazz
influence, or drop in a little Latin influence. And I always try to
come up with a better part, so it can be more exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Pan Rebels ran through ``In My House,'' Sharpe got a
new idea for the introduction. ``I'm going to put a part
together,'' he told a visitor. Standing at one of the double-tenor
pans, he plinked out a new harmony line, four notes at a time. One
drummer stood next to him, playing back each group of notes; three
others gathered around to watch. Sharpe made sure the drummer at
his side had both the notes and phrasing right, then moved on to
the cello pans, another layer of harmony.
</P>
<P>
   He hummed a tune for a drummer, and listened as she played it
back to him until the rhythm was crisp. Eventually all eight
sections of the band had been taught, and Sharpe tapped once again
on the side of a shiny steel drum. The ranks of players leaned into
the brand-new music, all the parts meshed easily, and Sharpe gave
his latest handiwork a calmly appraising ear.
</P>
<P>
   Holding drumsticks instead of a baton, dressed in a windbreaker
instead of a tuxedo, he didn't look like a symphony conductor. But
he had a full-sized orchestra at his disposal, eager to realize his
musical impulses as they occurred. ``This is the thing I always
wanted to be,'' he said.

   LOS ANGELES _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said Thursday that if
elected president he would force schools in poor areas to perform
by threatening to take away federal money from those that fail and
allow parents to use it for private schools. Addressing a Hispanic
business association lunch, Bush, a Republican, dismissed most
existing federal educational programs as failures. But in a
departure from traditional Republican thinking, he outlined a
strategy that would increase the role of th% federal Department of
Education by adding to it the Head Start program for preschoolers
and using federal funds to reward high-performing schools.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to the conservative preference for local control, Bush
said Washington should stay out of the business of setting
standards for schools, leaving that up to state and local
districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government must be humble enough to stay out of
the day-to-day operation of local schools, wise enough to give
states and school districts more authority and freedom, and strong
enough to require proven performance in return. When we spend
federal money, we want results _ especially when it comes to
disadvantaged children.''
</P>
<P>
   Education, which played only a modest role in the last
presidential election, has emerged as the top concern of voters and
the two parties are vying to demonstrate it has the means to
improve the nation's schools. Vice President Al Gore, who is
seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, devoted his first
major policy speech last spring to his plans for how the federal
government could bring about what he called ``revolutionary
change'' in education.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has emphasized his performance in Texas, where testing and
accountability have led to improved schools. But he has not used
state money there to reward or punish schools in the way he is
proposing.
</P>
<P>
   Bush Thursday carefully avoided using the politically sensitive
expression school vouchers. Vouchers, backed by many conservatives
and strongly opposed by many liberals, involve giving credits to
parents that could be used to remove children from public schools
and placed in private schools partly or wholly at government
expense.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said in his speech here Thursday that he would withdraw
federal funding from schools whose students tested poorly and that
parents of the children in those schools would receive as much as
$1,500 that could be used to send children to private schools or
other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and other leading Democrats oppose the use of school
vouchers, insisting they would weaken public schools by siphoning
away needed government funding. Secretary of Education Richard
Riley reacted to the speech by saying, ``No matter how you dress it
up, how long you delay it, or what you call it, a voucher is a
voucher. ... Vouchers undermine our public schools _ which educate
about 90 percent of our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Bush threaded together ideas of Democrats and
Republicans for his speech and many liberals reacted to Bush's plan
quite positively.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 80 percent are policies and initiatives we could support
and do support,'' said William L. Taylor, vice chair of the
Citizens Commission on Civil Rights. But he said that while he
favored the right of youngsters in failing schools to opt out and
go to schools that are succeeding, they should be restricted to
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would fundamentally alter two major federal
programs, Head Start, which offers everything from day care and
meals to poor children, and Title I, which is the main fund of
federal dollars for poor schools. He would refocus both on
improving reading ability and other basic skills. He added that he
would allow private agencies to compete for and administer some of
those programs, which currently involve almost $13 billion a year
in spending, if the children in them test poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my administration, federal money will no longer follow
failure,'' he said. ``Public funds must be spent on things that
work.'' Bush did not address whether the private agencies would
then be tested, what kind of bureaucracy would be required to
handle the bidding for the contracts or what would happen to the
schools that lost federal funding.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, regarded as the frontrunner among the Republican
candidates, described federal programs as involving ``high hopes
and low achievement, grand plans and unmet goals.'' Indeed, one of
the most frequently used words in his speech here Thursday was
``failure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to start where educational failure has its highest
price,'' said Bush. ``I want to begin with the disadvantaged
children in struggling schools, and the federal role in helping
them.''
</P>
<P>
   He promised to reorganize what he characterized as a confusing
maze of federal programs with little emphasis on measurable
results.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been criticized by some of his opponents for being
short on specifics about policy, and he said Thursday's address
would be the first in a series of policy speeches on education,
which he described as one of his highest priorities. He spoke to
the Latino Business Association at the Los Angeles Convention
Center, and peppered his remarks with Spanish to a highly
appreciative audience, made up largely of entrepreneurs and small
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   The line that drew that strongest applause was: ``Some say it is
unfair to hold disadvantaged children to rigorous standards. I say
it is discrimination to require anything less, the soft bigotry of
low expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the ideas Bush outlined Thursday have been a part of his
educational strategy in Texas. He inherited some of those programs
from his Democratic predecessor, Ann Richards, as well as other
state administrations, but he has pursued testing and a focus on
teaching reading skills vigorously. Test results have risen
considerably in the state, particularly for minority students, but
the gap between white and minority children remains large.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not address many of Gore's education proposals. Gore,
for instance, has proposed making preschool universally available,
offering tax breaks to encourage saving for college, reductions in
the size of classes in public schools, testing of teachers to make
sure they live up to basic standards, and ensuring that students
develop a basic competency with computers by the eighth grade.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, by contrast, focused on teaching reading, particularly to
young children. He said that children should begin learning to read
at ages three and four, and he insisted that the best method was
phonics. He said that the Head Start program should be changed to
focus on teaching reading to these young children and that the
program should be transferred from the Department of Health and
Human Services to the Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Bush equated failure to learn to read at a young age with a
propensity to turn to crime later in life. ``More and more, we are
divided into two nations, separate and unequal, one that reads and
one that can't, one that dreams and one that doesn't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush offered his clearest set of rewards and penalties for
schools that receive federal funds under the Title I program. He
said that the disadvantaged students at those schools would be
tested every year, with the tests written and administered by the
states, not the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Schools that show improvement, he said, would receive additional
federal grants. Bush has said he strongly favors reducing taxes and
cutting the federal budget, and he did not discuss how he would pay
for the grants Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Schools that test poorly, he added, would receive warnings. If
they continued to fail to show improvement for three years, the
Title I funds they receive would be divided up, matched by
additional federal money and given to the state. The state would
pass the money to the parents of the children in those schools _ as
much as $1,500 each per year _ and it could be used for tutoring,
switching the students to charter schools, semiautonomous public
schools, different public schools or private schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any case, the federal government will no longer pay schools
to cheat poor children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Effective reform requires accountability. Someone
should be praised when schools succeed, and someone must be
responsible when schools fail.'' He also insisted that, in spite of
the breadth of these federal initiatives, control over schools
would be placed largely in local hands, a policy that is central to
the conservative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In calling for each state, and not the federal government, to
devise the standards by which each student would be measured, Bush
succeeded in allaying the fears of some conservatives who worry
about centralized control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is betting where I personally always bet, that state
policy-makers and parents are likeliest to do right by kids,'' said
Chester E. Finn, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, which
studies educational issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bush sought to emphasize that he would remain flexible in
certain respects. He said that he would back bilingual education,
something many conservatives have fought bitterly, particularly in
California, if it proved effective in the form of better test
scores. He also said that he would back language immersion programs
if they could be shown to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``What matters is not the varying methods, but the common
standards and goals,'' Bush said. ``The standard is English
literacy. The goal is equal opportunity.''

 &HT;    Judge threatens contempt if files related to Branch Davidian
suit withheld
 &HT;    By Mark England and Tommy Witherspoon
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ A Waco federal judge Thursday ordered the federal
government to turn over all evidence related to an upcoming lawsuit
filed by surviving Branch Davidians by the end of the month or face
a contempt citation.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. dismissed a motion by
the Justice Department challenging the order as an ``unwarranted
and substantial burden'' on the federal government. William Blagg,
the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Texas, argued that
Smith's order hindered the federal government's preparation to
defend itself in the civil lawsuit set to go before Smith on Oct.
18.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was scornful of the government's argument that his order
was too demanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Court finds this argument somewhat disingenuous since the
government has been in possession of this material for six years
and has been aware since 1994, when the civil suits were originally
filed, that this material could very well be subject to
discovery,'' Smith wrote. ``Additionally, the Court would have
thought that the vast majority of the material now sought in this
civil litigation would have already been compiled as a result of
the various Congressional hearings held over the Branch Davidian
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Blagg warned in his motion filed earlier this week that
compliance with the order could also potentially harm upcoming
Justice Department and Congressional investigations into what
happened at Mount Carmel, the Davidians' home 10 miles outside
Waco.
</P>
<P>
   In order not to interfere with any investigations, Smith wrote
that he would allow agencies turning over original evidence to his
court to make copies for their files.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Caddell, an attorney for some of the plaintiffs suing the
government, welcomed Smith's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hallelujah,'' said Caddell, who is based in Houston. ``I think
the government has demonstrated that they're not capable of
safeguarding the evidence, and they're certainly not capable of
analyzing it. The only way the plaintiffs will feel comfortable is
with the court taking custody of the evidence. We anticipate that
with the appropriate response, we'll get access to it.''
</P>
<P>
   In his order, Smith demanded that all documents, reports,
photographs, audio and video tapes _ ``including those recently
seized from the Hostage Rescue Team of the FBI'' _ related to the
Davidian lawsuit be delivered to the clerk for the Western District
of Texas, based in San Antonio, by Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Noncompliance with the order will earn Blagg a trip to Waco at
10 a.m. on Oct. 1 to see Smith, the order states, to ``explain why
he and the United States should not be held in contempt of court.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Blagg nor the Justice Department returned phone calls
requesting an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Smith had copies of his order delivered to Blagg, Attorney
General Janet Reno, FBI Director Louis Freeh and ATF Director John
McGaw.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said he didn't know why the Justice Department objected
to Smith's order.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three possibilities,'' Caddell said. ``They filed it
as a matter of principle because it's something they feel strongly
about; it was a delaying tactic; or there is something they're
still trying to hide. I don't really feel it was done as a matter
of principle. I vote for the other two possibilities. The
government has blocked our efforts to see the evidence for six
years. And even now, after all this time, they're still refusing to
turn the evidence over.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith warned that any party ``that destroys, alters or otherwise
tampers with any evidence related to the Branch Davidian criminal
or civil litigation will be considered in contempt of court, with
the resulting punishment to be determined by this Court.''

BANK OF NEW YORK DISMISSES SECOND EMPLOYEE IN LAUNDERING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Bank of New York said Thursday that it had
dismissed a second employee involved in its investigation into
possible money laundering at the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The employee, Svetlana Kudryavtsev, was discharged for failing
to cooperate with the bank's internal investigation into the
suspected money laundering, a person close to the inquiry said. The
bank refused to elaborate on the ouster.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kudryavtsev joined the bank in 1994 and was an international
bank associate, not an officer, in the East European division in
New York, the person close to the investigation said. Ms.
Kudryavtsev could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   She was discharged six days after the bank had ousted a vice
president in the East European division, Lucy Edwards. Ms. Edwards,
who worked in London, was dismissed for ``gross misconduct,'' said
a person with direct knowledge of the dismissal, including the
falsification of bank records, failure to cooperate with
investigators and for never telling the bank that she was married
to Peter Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin had opened accounts at the bank in the name of a company
called Benex. Federal investigators say at least $4.2 billion, and
perhaps up to $10 billion, was channeled through Benex accounts at
the bank over 18 months starting some time early last year.
</P>
<P>
   Although little is known about Berlin, investigators say they
believe that the money came from criminal activities, political
graft and corporate embezzlement in Russia and that it was being
laundered for figures in organized crime in Russia. Some of the
money was also probably capital flight, Russian executives and U.S.
law-enforcement authorities said, secreted out of the country last
year, when Russia faced a grave financial crisis and its banks and
currency collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Press reports have speculated that some of the money may have
been diverted from loans to Russia by the International Monetary
Fund or from food-aid programs. But the IMF and the U.S. government
said they had no hard evidence of that.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin and his wife, who was born Lydmila Pritzker and emigrated
to the United States from Russia more than 20 years ago, lived in
the in the New York area until a few years ago, when the bank
transferred Ms. Edwards to London.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the bank nor any employees, including the two who were
dismissed, have been charged with wrongdoing by legal authorities.
According to Reuters, Ms. Edwards issued a statement Thursday
through her lawyer in London in which she ``strenuously denied''
the allegations on which the bank based her ouster. The statement
said that Ms. Edwards was ``pursuing the remedies available against
the bank, and we have notified the bank accordingly.'' The
statement did not say what the allegations were, and neither has
the bank.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer in New York for both Ms. Edwards and her husband, T.
Barry Kingham, told Reuters, ``Both Peter and Lucy firmly deny any
wrongdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorting out the exact sources of the money and the extent to
which the movement violated any laws will take many months, perhaps
years, U.S. officials said. Layers of companies were used to
disguise the origins and destinations of the money, and many of the
companies were registered in places like the Isle of Man in the
Irish Sea and Antigua, which have strict bank-secrecy laws and lax
disclosure requirements.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. law-enforcement officials said the only hope that they had
of eventually getting to the bottom of the allegations was with the
full cooperation of the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
   Another senior bank officer whom investigators say they are
looking at closely is Natasha Gurfinkel Kagalovsky, who was in
charge of the East European division in New York and worked closely
with Ms. Edwards. The bank suspended Ms. Kagalovsky, with pay,
after the allegations of money laundering became public Aug. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kagalovsky and her husband, Konstantin Kagalovsky, a
prominent Russian businessman, have denied wrongdoing. She and her
husband own a condominium on E. 47th St. in Manhattan. Contrary to
earlier reports, the apartment has a mortgage, her husband said
last week in an interview in Moscow.

 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the early years, their aides portrayed Janet
Reno and Louis Freeh as one of the capital's perfect power pairings
_ a tough, down-to-earth attorney general who was happy to have the
ex-FBI agent, former Mafia prosecutor and federal judge as her
chief law enforcement officer.
</P>
<P>
   But officials who know them both said the image never really fit
the reality, and, in recent days, the disclosures that the FBI
failed to produce tape recordings from its files about the use of
heat-generating tear gas canisters during the 1993 assault on the
Branch Davidian compound has split open a seam of discontent.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict between Reno, Freeh and their two agencies was
apparent Wednesday afternoon when Reno angrily dispatched agents of
the U.S. Marshal's Service to Freeh's headquarters to seize
previously undisclosed tapes that contained radio voice
communications of agents asking for and receiving authorization
from their operational commanders to fire the tear-gas rounds at
Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, FBI officials complained that Reno ordered the
marshals to take custody of the tapes in a way that left a powerful
impression that Reno no longer believed the FBI could be trusted.
``It was a heavy-handed thing to do,'' said one law enforcement
official. ``Like the FBI was going to destroy the evidence?''
</P>
<P>
   The White House sided with Reno in blaming the FBI for the
lapses that placed her in an extremely awkward position. ``The
president is deeply concerned that the attorney general appears to
have been misled and may have been lied to,'' Jake Siewert, a White
House spokesman, said Thursday. ``She has vowed to get to bottom of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reno's own credibility has been grievously damaged.
Republicans in Congress blamed her, not the FBI, for misleading
them about potentially relevant evidence. She had opened herself to
criticism because it was not the FBI, but the Justice Department,
that led what seemed to some officials like half-hearted internal
inquiries into Waco on which she based her long-held conclusion
that there was no possibility the FBI could have started the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the new evidence that has remained in the FBI files for
more than six years does not contradict Reno's conclusions. As FBI
officials reconstructed events, the two flammable tear gas rounds
were fired hours before the assault and landed harmlessly at a
bunker near the compound before the fire started that killed about
80 people, including many children.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was over Waco that Reno first encountered the
powerful bureaucracy of the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   At first, FBI officials were skeptical of Reno, a moderate
former Miami prosecutor, but they were won over by her stalwart
defense of the agency's conduct at Waco. She took personal
responsibility for the outcome, blamed the Branch Davidians for
starting the fire and rebuffed all criticism of the FBI's
military-style tactics in the tear-gas assault operation.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, some associates of Reno and Freeh denied that there
was any personal animosity between the two officials or that they
would acknowledge that professional trust in each other had eroded.
But even these officials acknowledged that senior FBI officials had
gradually lost confidence in Reno and that she had grown frustrated
by the law enforcement agency's independence.
</P>
<P>
   Other current and former Justice Department and FBI officials
said the disclosures regarding the use of pyrotechnic tear gas at
Waco represented a final straw to Reno after years of simmering
disputes with the FBI over its independent dealings with Congress
in budget, legislative, national security and investigative
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship seemed to sour after news accounts reported in
1997 that Freeh had urged Reno to seek an independent prosecutor to
investigate how the Democrats financed their 1996 presidential
election campaign _ a position that badly undercut Reno, already
under heavy fire from Republicans in Congress who had attacked her
for refusing to refer the case to an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when Reno's own prosecutor on the campaign finance
inquiry, Charles La Bella, resigned saying he agreed with the FBI
director on the issue of an outside counsel, Reno's credibility
eroded further. La Bella subsequently lost a bid to become U.S.
attorney in San Diego. Later, Freeh awarded La Bella the FBI's
distinguished service medal in a ceremony that Reno did not attend.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, tensions between top officials ignited again
in a bitter crossfire over the handling of an investigation of a
nuclear scientist at the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico. FBI
officials said they had appealed to Reno for permission to begin
electronic surveillance of the scientist, Wen Ho Lee, but Justice
Department officials rejected their request.
</P>
<P>
   Reno angrily replied that FBI officials, including Freeh, had
failed to inform her that the application for surveillance was a
top priority _ even as Republicans in Congress again assailed her
for holding back an inquiry into the suspected theft of highly
classified nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been too forgiving by nature,'' said one law enforcement
official with associates at the Justice Department and the FBI
``There's a feeling that she just hasn't reigned them in and that
now it may be too late for her to take back control.''

MIDEAST STANDOFF REMAINS UNSOLVED AS ALBRIGHT VISITS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ On her first trip to the Middle East since the
Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, came to power, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright hit a snag when the Israelis and
Palestinians failed to deliver an agreement for a signing ceremony
in Egypt Thursday that she hoped to preside over.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiating atmosphere between the two sides that was
supposed to have substantially improved with the new Israeli leader
had not warmed sufficiently to allow the release of 50 Palestinian
prisoners now held in Israel. That issue stands in the way of
reviving the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear whether the dispute over the
prisoners constituted a real crisis or a matter of each side
wanting to show their constituencies that they were reaching for
the best possible bargain on an emotional issue.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who had delayed her trip for two weeks at the request
of the Israeli prime minister met with Palestinian leader, Yasser
Arafat, and the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, in Alexandria,
Egypt, and then flew here for a meeting early Friday morning with
Barak.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, at the request of Barak, has taken
more of a back seat in the current negotiations, which cover
completion of a deal signed in Wye, Md., last fall in which Israel
agreed to give up West Bank land in exchange for greater security.
Being discussed is also the much broader question of a framework
for a permanent settlement.
</P>
<P>
   A failure to complete the agreement before the secretary leaves
for a scheduled visit on Saturday to Syria to meet the Syrian
President, Hafez Assad, in Damascus, would put a damper on her
ability to persuade Assad to restart negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Israeli desire for the Americans to keep a lower
profile and the administration's insistence that it was happy to
see both sides negotiating directly, Albright injected herself into
the process. She is to visit Jordan on Sunday and is trying to get
an agreement completed before she leaves the region for Asia later
that day.
</P>
<P>
   She met with Arafat, accompanied by one of his top security
officials, for more than an hour in Alexandria, and in the middle
of that meeting telephoned Barak.
</P>
<P>
   On the 40-minute flight from Alexandria to Tel Aviv, a senior
administration official played down the gravity of the logjam, and
said that both sides were making ``a very serious effort.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that only a few issues were left to resolve, and that an
agreement might be reached Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Albright was not playing the role of ``mediator'' but rather
conveying concerns and making suggestions, he said. ``They've done
the vast majority of the work,'' the official said of the Israelis
and Palestinians. They had been assisted a great deal, he said, by
the Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian foreign minister, Amr Moussa, standing beside
Albright at a news conference here after Palestinian and Israeli
flags that had been readied for a ceremony were put aside, said the
agreement could be completed in ``hours'' or ``days.'' When it was
ready, Moussa said he expected a ceremony to take place in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   The administration official declined to specify whether the
prisoner issue was the sole hurdle to be overcome, but suggested
that several other issues had become interrelated as the
negotiations went down to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis see the ``security prisoners,'' as opposed to
criminals, as terrorists, but the Palestinians view them as freedom
fighters who fought against the occupation of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In their negotiations, the Israelis agreed to release 350
prisoners but the Palestinians wanted 400 released. The Israelis
have insisted that they would not release any prisoner who murdered
an Israeli and that there were not 50 more prisoners who met their
criteria for release.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoner issue became suddenly even more sensitive for Barak
after a young Orthodox Jewish couple were found stabbed to death
last weekend. On Wednesday, the military arm of Hamas, an Islamic
fundamentalist group, claimed responsibility for the killings.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank and Gaza earlier this week, mothers
demonstrated with framed photographs of their jailed sons.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoner issue is also difficult because the types of
prisoners to be released was not specified in the original Wye
memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for the release of 750 prisoners, but other
details _ whether the prisoners to be released were criminals or
``security'' prisoners _ were decided in oral agreements among
President Clinton, Arafat, and Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime
minister at the time.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On the question of the turnover of land that was called for in
the Wye agreement, the current negotiations envision the Israelis
ceding 11 percent more of the West Bank to full or partial
Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   The first 2 percent of the 13 percent called for at Wye was
turned over by Netanyahu who then stopped the implementation of the
accord.
</P>
<P>
   Barak wants to combine the final withdrawal of Israeli troops
called for in the Wye agreement into progress in the permanent
status negotiations. This is desirable for Barak because the last _
and largest withdrawal _ mandated by Wye would leave about 15
Jewish settlements virtually encircled by Palestinian-controlled
land.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the prisoner issue, Barak's call for a specific
date early in the new year for a framework on the permanent status
negotiations has also been a sticking point for Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, relieved at the election in May of
Barak as prime minister, and the defeat of Netanyahu, would like to
get the permanent status talks going as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary was accompanied here by the administration's top
Middle East negotiators - presidential advisor Dennis Ross, Martin
Indyk, who is the assistant secretary of state for the Near East,
and Middle East expert Aaron Miller.
</P>
<P>
   In the current negotiations, Barak is seeking a date early in
the New Year for a framework agreement on permanent status talks.
Arafat is said to be nervous about a defined date. These talks
would define the hardest issues of all _ the future of Jerusalem,
the return of refugees and the borders of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   These questions could be settled by the end of 2000, the
Israelis argue, a date that does not displease Clinton who leaves
office then and sees a permanent settlement in the Middle East as a
crowning glory of his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of the overall,'' Albright said about the final
status talks during her flight from Washington, ``this is a very
high priority for President Clinton. You can figure out the timing
for yourself.''

 &HT;    Jury convicts man of killing family in Georgia
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONROE, Ga. _ Jerry Scott Heidler's attorney asked the jury that
convicted him Thursday of the Santa Claus murders to ``extend mercy
to this pathetic young man,'' but a jailer testified that Heidler
told him he was a collector of souls _ and his collection was not
complete.
</P>
<P>
   The jury of seven men and five women is expected to decide today
whether the 22-year-old Heidler will spend his life in prison or
die in the electric chair.
</P>
<P>
   They took just 20 minutes to find him guilty of the Dec. 4,
1997, murders of Kim and Danny Daniels and two of their children.
They also convicted him of the seven other charges he was facing:
three of kidnapping, three of sodomy and molestation involving the
three girls he kidnapped, and one of burglary.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors disregarded defense attorney Michael Garret's plea to
find Heidler guilty but mentally ill, which would not have spared
him the specter of the death penalty but would have indicated they
had some sympathy for him.
</P>
<P>
   Heidler was convicted of breaking into the home of the family
that had befriended him in the Toombs County village of Santa
Claus, taking one of Danny Daniels' shotguns and killing the
sleeping adults adults and Jessica, 16, and Brent, 8. He kidnapped
three more girls briefly and left two younger children, including a
10-month-old, alone with the blood-soaked bodies.
</P>
<P>
   In the penalty phase of the trial, moved to Walton County
because of heavy publicity, District Attorney Richard Malone told
jurors Heidler ``remains the same horrible killer that he was on
Dec. 4, 1997.'' Imprisoning him instead of executing him, he said,
would subject guards and inmates to ``the rages of this man for the
rest of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrett, who will present his major witnesses today, asked for
mercy for ``this very, very mixed-up, sick young man.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce LeBlanc, a booking officer at the Tombs County jail, said
he often had conversations with Heidler because the scrawny,
chapfallen killer ``gets a little antsy because he doesn't have
anyone to talk to.''
</P>
<P>
   One night, LeBlanc said, he noticed Heidler was wearing a
crucifix inverted on a chain around his neck. ``I asked him if he
didn't worry about his soul,'' LeBlanc said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he didn't worry about his soul any more. I asked him
why. He said he was a collector of souls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Jerry, what in the world are you talking about?' He
said he wasn't through collecting souls, and he showed me the
tattoo on his knuckles. It reads `Sandman.'''
</P>
<P>
   LeBlanc said Heidler told him the Sandman was a movie character
whose soul belongs to the devil ``and who goes around killing whole
families in their sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Other jailers testified that they had found as many as 75 crude
weapons Heidler had made in the 20 months he was in the Toombs
County jail. They said he was constantly unscrewing wire cages from
smoke and fire alarms and on one occasion, even taking the lock out
of a jail door. They said he routinely threatened to kill jailers.
</P>
<P>
   Dean McManus, the GBI agent who lead the investigation into the
Santa Claus killings, said that almost a year later, he got a
collect call from a prisoner whose voice he didn't immediately
recognize.
</P>
<P>
   The caller told McManus he ``had a score to settle with him,''
and McManus began to suspect it was Heidler. Finally, McManus said,
the caller said: ``You don't know who this is, do you? I'll give
you a hint.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please do,'' McManus said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine little piggies, four dead,'' the caller retorted. Moments
later, the agent said, a jailer at Toombs County came on the line
and confirmed the caller was Heidler.

ISRAEL'S LIKUD PARTY SELECTS SHARON AS ITS LEADER

 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Ariel Sharon, the aging but pugnacious former
warrior, captured the leadership of the opposition Likud Party in
primaries Thursday night, succeeding Benjamin Netanyahu, who had
quit after he lost his bid to be re-elected prime minister in May.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon, 71, an energetic veteran of many Israeli military and
political battles, overwhelmingly defeated two leaders of a younger
generation of Likudniks: Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, 54, and Meir
Sheetrit, 51, who served as chairman of Netanyahu's governing
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   While Olmert had made clear that he had his sights set on
becoming prime minister, Sharon had said that he would serve only
as the steward of a party left greatly demoralized by its defeat in
May. He promised to hold new primaries in two years to select the
Likud candidate for prime minister in the next national elections.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts theorized Thursday night that Sharon would
end up serving as a place-holder for a resurgent Netanyahu, who has
withdrawn from public view since he was trounced by Ehud Barak, the
new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   That expectation, nurtured by Sharon, certainly motivated many
followers of Netanyahu to vote for him. Indeed, when Netanyahu
showed up to cast his own vote Thursday, he was trailed by acolytes
chanting, ``He'll be back.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is no question that this is also a comeback of sorts
for Sharon, a general, lawyer and gentleman farmer who is a
larger-than-life Israeli character.
</P>
<P>
   Always seeking to rehabilitate a reputation tainted by the 1982
Israeli invasion of Lebanon, which he directed as defense minister,
Sharon will for the first time take the helm of his own party.
</P>
<P>
   White-haired, portly and ever re-chargeable, Sharon has said he
hopes to revitalize the ailing Likud. As a low voter turnout
Thursday demonstrated, the party is riven by internal strife and an
ideological identity crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Since Likud endorsed the most recent Israeli-Palestinian peace
agreement, it gave up its mantle as protector of the land of Israel
against territorial compromise and joined the large, amorphous
political center. In the May elections, it was greatly weakened,
capturing only 19 of the 120 seats in parliament, second to One
Israel/Labor's 26.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon, a former foreign minister and defense minister, has
always brought out extreme emotions in Israelis. He is revered by
some and despised by others.
</P>
<P>
   On the world stage and in a good part of Israel, he never
succeeded in overcoming his responsibility for the invasion of
Lebanon and the massacres that followed. He will be always be
closely associated with the slaughter of Palestinian refugees by
Israel's ally, the Lebanese Christian Phalangists.
</P>
<P>
   The massacres cost him his job as defense minister, after a
government investigating commission held him liable for failing to
prevent the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon has bounced back politically over time _ partly because
many Israelis believed that the invasion of Lebanon was ultimately
redeemed by its success in crushing the Palestine Liberation
Organization's military structure. But he was always in someone
else's shadow, however outsized his hovering presence in the
background.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he will take over the main opposition party just as Lebanon
moves front and center in the Israeli consciousness once again.
Since the invasion, Israeli troops have occupied a 9-mile-deep
security zone in southern Lebanon. But principle campaign pledge of
Barak was to pull them out by next May.
</P>
<P>
   At midnight, with half the votes counted, Sharon had captured 55
percent to Olmert's 24 percent and Sheetrit's 23 percent of the
ballots.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Olmert, a former parliament member and cabinet minister, had a
hard time living down what many party faithfuls perceived to have
been a traitorous act on his part. During the national campaign,
while Netanyahu was trying to sell himself as the only candidate
who could save a united Jerusalem, Olmert, a political rival of
Netanyahu, vouched for Barak's security credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Olmert's comments that ``Ehud Barak will not divide Jerusalem''
were used in Barak's television advertising. That image planted
itself in Likud Party members' heads; even a well-financed campaign
and a last-minute endorsement by former Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir failed to help Omert.
</P>
<P>
   Sheetrit, who, like many of the party's members is a Sephardic
Jew, offered himself up as the only candidate who cared about
social issues. Using Israeli code, he was playing the ethnic card,
but without success.
</P>
<P>
   When Sharon's son Omri inadvertently touched on ethnic issues
during the campaign, offending the party's working-class
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Omri Sharon and the Likud's director general, Uri Shani, said
during an interview with a leading newspaper columnist that
Sharon's government-issued Cadillac kept breaking down. But Sharon
was not planning to replace it, they said, because ``it makes a
huge impression on the Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Sharon, the damage did not last.
</P>
<P>
   It was barely apparent here Thursday that voting was taking
place, although 323 polls were open across the country. The apathy
within the party _ 33 percent of its 143,000 registered members
voted, which by Israeli standards is low _ was echoed in a
nation-wide indifference to the leadership battle inside the
country's second-largest party. The primaries were barely mentioned
in the news.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, nostalgia for Netanyahu, whose charisma
earned him almost cult status among some Likudniks, grew during the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Even in his absence, he dominated this election campaign. Some
prominent right-wingers supported Olmert, who is more dovish than
Sharon, because they feared the return of the former prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Now it remains to be seen whether Sharon can rebuild the Likud
Party without the former prime minister's active participation. But
just as Netanyahu, in his absence, dominated this campaign, his
influence on the Likud Party is bound to persist.

$1.35 MILLION MORTGAGE ON CLINTONS' NEW HOME IS SECURED IN CASH

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKANEATELES, N.Y. _ President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton
on Thursday settled the question of where the first family will
live once their lease on the White House expires, signing a
contract to purchase a a $1.7 million, 11-room Dutch Colonial home
set in the wooded suburbs of Westchester County, north of New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of a home in New York removes one of the chief
obstacles in Mrs. Clinton's path as she prepares for a run for the
U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons, indebted by over $5 million in legal bills that
have accumulated because of the legal inquires that have marked the
Clinton presidency, were able to purchase the five-bedroom home in
Chappaqua after Clinton's chief fund-raiser, Terry McAuliffe,
personally secured the loan.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said that McAuliffe had put up $1.35 million of
his own money with Bankers Trust. Under the terms of the mortgage,
McAullife will receive the money back, with interest, once the
Clintons either pay back the mortgage or, as is more likely,
refinance it in five years.
</P>
<P>
   The interest rate on the loan is to be determined at closing,
which is set for Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution of where the Clintons would live was announced in
a three-paragraph statement issued by the temporary Press Office of
the White House _ a room in the Holiday Inn in Auburn, about seven
miles from the Clintons are vacationing.
</P>
<P>
   It apparently concludes what has certainly been one of the more
unusual house-hunting expeditions embarked on by any American
family, complicated by the Clintons' station in life, the fact that
they have now owned a home in 16 years, and Mrs. Clinton's
political ambitions in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased about the house,'' Mrs. Clinton said as she
left a fund-raiser for her presumed Senate campaign Thursday
evening in Cazenovia and headed to another one in Syracuse. ``It's
beautiful. We like it a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the ethics of accepting such financial assistance from a
Democratic fund-raiser, Jake Siewert, a spokesman for the White
House, said of McAuliffe: ``He's a close friend.''
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe has proved to be an unusually effective rainmaker for
the Clintons. He raised record millions for Clinton's 1996
re-election campaign, so much that his father said in a recent
newspaper interview that Terry had essentially gotten Clinton
re-elected. McAuliffe is also raising money for Mrs. Clinton's
expected Senate campaign _ goal: $25 million _ and for the
president's legal defense fund. He is also raising more than $10
million for a millennium bash hosted by the Clintons on the
Washington mall.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton's neighbors-to-be have expressed some concern that
the first family's presence would increase traffic in the area,
while others are hopeful that their presence will increase property
values.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons said in their statement: ``We appreciate everyone
who helped make our search for a new home an enjoyable experience.
We particularly want to thank the homeowners, their neighbors and
the real estate brokers who have been so gracious to us throughout
our search.''

 &HT;    Bush proposes voucher plan for failing public schools
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ GOP presidential front-runner George W. Bush, who
couldn't get Texas legislators to divert state money to private
schools, on Thursday proposed what critics called a national
``back-door voucher'' plan that would use federal money to get kids
out of failing public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wants to cut the flow of federal money to schools that
continually fall short of state standards and use the dollars for
``whatever option parents choose.'' That could include other public
schools, charter schools, tutoring or private schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to start where educational failure has its highest
price,'' Bush said. ``I want to begin with disadvantaged children
in struggling schools and the federal role in helping them.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan drew quick criticism from Vice President Al Gore, who
on Wednesday, during a trip to San Antonio, rapped the quality of
public schools in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the sweet talk in the world can't hide the fact that
George Bush wants to slam the door on the kids in America's public
school system,'' said Gore spokeswoman Kiki Moore. ``If there is
any money left for education after the Republican tax scheme, he
wants to yank it out of the public school system with his back-door
voucher program.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats and some national educational leaders also
criticized the plan. ``The American pubic does not support
vouchers. They know this is the beginning of the erosion of public
schools,'' said Roy Romer, general chairman of the Democratic
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public schools should be held accountable, and so should
politicians,'' said Bob Chase, president of the National Education
Association. ``Governor Bush says he wants to invest in programs
that work, but he's willing to waste millions of tax dollars on
vouchers, which don't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush laid out his plan to the Latin Business Association in a
speech entitled ``No Child Left Behind.'' He will offer more
education proposals in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, said Bush, is to end government's education monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must recognize the essential role of competition in
achieving our goals, competition from charters and parental choice
and home schooling,'' he said. ``All monopolies are slow to reform
when consumers have no power to express their frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   While positioning himself as a champion of public schools, Bush
said too many of them are failing. He said the federal government
has backed programs that are ``sloppy and trendy, focusing on
self-esteem over basic skills.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to call his plan a voucher program, but declared,
``Federal money will no longer follow failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Adhering to a philosophy he has pushed in Texas, Bush said the
nation must find a way to stop paying for schools that don't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pigment and poverty need not determine performance,'' said
Bush, who has failed in three legislative sessions to win approval
for a pilot program under which parents of children in subpar
schools could get state dollars to pay private school tuition.
</P>
<P>
   His new proposal calls for a landmark shift in the spending of
money from the federal Title 1 program that sends $7.7 billion a
year to schools with students from low-income families. The Austin
Independent School District receives about $11 million in Title 1
funds annually. About 52 percent of AISD's 78,000 students qualify
for such funds.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wants all schools that get Title 1 funds, now about 44,000,
to offer annual exams to measure student performance on basic
academics.
</P>
<P>
   Bush received lukewarm support from one the nation's most
influential Hispanic groups, the National Council of La Raza.
``We're on track in terms of the concern, but we differ on a
solution,'' NCLR President Raul Yzaguirre said of how Title 1 funds
currently are spent.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of backlash from Republicans who oppose national
testing, Bush wants to allow each state to set the standards.
Schools that fail to show annual progress would get warnings from
the federal government. Three strikes would mean the school would
be out of federal Title 1 funds.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the money would be given to the states, which would set
up education accounts for parents to use as they see fit. The
account would provide about $1,500 a year per student. The money
could be spent on private school tuition only in states that
approve such an option.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said parents could use the money ``for whatever offers
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the best case, these schools will rise to the challenge and
regain the confidence of parents,'' Bush said. ``In the worst case,
we will offer scholarships to America's neediest children, allowing
them to get the emergency help they should have. In any case, the
federal government will no longer pay schools to cheat poor
children.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of using public money to pay private school tuition won
support from Steve Rabago, a business consultant who heard Bush
pitch the plan. Rabago is the president of the Laguna Beach school
board.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should be able to go elsewhere,'' he said of students in
low-performing public schools.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, John C. Bowman, with the Texas Public Policy
Foundation, one of the most vocal supporters of school vouchers
applauded the plan as ``a positive step to reinvigorating a
disengaged portion of our population who have largely been pushed
out of the public sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush predicted subpar schools facing the possibility of student
defections would find ways to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any case, the federal government will no longer pay schools
to cheat poor children,'' he said, realizing his plan could have
significant impact on urban schools that get massive doses of Title
1 money.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also wants to apply his results-oriented approach to the
politically perilous question of how best to teach English to
students who grew up with another language.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a good immersion program works, I say fine. If a good
bilingual program works to teach children English, we should
applaud it,'' he said. ``What matters is not the varying methods,
but the common standards and goals. The standard is English
literacy.''

   Bush also wants to move the Head Start pre-school program from
the Department of Health and Human Services to the Department of
Education as part of a plan to pump up the education component of
the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Head Start was originally intended as a literacy program,
designed to close the achievement gap between rich and poor,'' Bush
said. ``It evolved into a day care, health and nutrition program.''

ISRAELIS, PALESTINIANS FAIL TO RESOLVE ISSUES

<P>
   CAIRO _ US Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright arrived
Thursday in Egypt to the trappings of a signing ceremony that never
took place, as Israelis and Palestinians failed to bridge
differences on how to implement a critical phase of the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   It had been hoped that Albright's tour of the region would begin
with a ceremony marking a new breakthrough in the long-delayed
peace process and from there Albright would seize the momentum to
reopen direct talks between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   But instead Albright was left fielding questions at a press
conference at a presidential palace in Alexandria about the latest
snag in the ``land for security'' deal signed nearly a year ago in
Maryland but never successfully implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Although Albright noted that both sides were still talking and
expressed hope that an agreement could come as soon as Friday, she
said, ``The road to true peace remains hard and uphill. . . . The
US and Egypt can be helpful, but it is up to the parties to make
the hard decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the opulent palace in Alexandria, Israeli and Palestinian
flags that were supposed to flank a signing ceremony were left in a
hallway as reporters grilled Albright and Egyptian Foreign Ministr
Amr Moussa about the significance of the latest hitch in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   Albright met with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Palestinian Authority president Yasser Arafat briefly in
Alexandria, and then left for Israel where she planned to meet with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat had come to Alexandria amid hopes the sticking point on
the issue of the release of Palestinian security prisoners from
Israeli jails would be resolved at the last minute. But Barak never
arrived, as the Israelis refused to budge on the issue of releasing
prisoners who have been involved in killing Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   The deadlock comes down to a disagreement over 50 Palestinian
prisoners. The Palestinians say they want 400 prisoners to be
released as is required by the Wye River agreement. But Israel said
it would release only 350, insisting that the other 50 had ``blood
on their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The prisoner issue is a resonant one with high domestic
political stakes for both Barak and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has seen conservative political forces in the country
become galvanized on the issue in recent speeches and
demonstrations, making it clear that if Barak releases any
Palestinians who killed Israelis he will pay a heavy political
price for it.
</P>
<P>
   And Arafat is aware of the Palestinian demonstrations calling
for the return of the detainees who are seen as patriots and
prisoners of war in the fight against Israel for the Palestinian
cause. Palestinian political sources say Arafat's repeated
concessions in the process are hurting his image and that the
release of prisoners has become an important threshold that
Palestinians are not willing to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the impasse, Egyptian Foreign Minister Moussa remarked on
the importance of moving forward soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere was very much poisoned in the last few years,''
he said referring to the setbacks that occurred in the process
under Barak's more conservative predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it is our task to revive the peace process and introduce a
level of optimism in the region,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye River deal, brokered by President Clinton last October
at the Wye River plantation in Maryland, was signed in Washington
by Arafat and Netanyahu. But Netanyahu froze the interim agreement
only two months later after handing over just two percent of West
Bank land to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, as originally conceived, called for the release of 750
Palestinian prisoners and a three-stage Israeli troop withdrawal
from a further 13 percent of the West Bank in return for further
security steps to be taken by Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   If that 13 percent of the West Bank is ceded to the Palestinian
Authority, the Palestinians would be left with full or partial
control of roughly 40 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Under the emerging agreement, the next Israeli troop pullback
would begin in the next few days, to be followed by a second one
Nov. 15 and a third one at the end of the year or the beginning of
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The calling off of the signing ceremony must come as a
disappointment to Albright, who will now have to devote much of her
time to trying to push the two sides to reach an agreement. Aides
say she had hoped to concentrate more on laying the groundwork for
a resumption of direct talks between Israel and Syria over the
Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Albright is expected to visit Syria Saturday. The Israeli-Syrian
negotiating track was derailed in 1996. Syrians claim the Israelis
have promised in principle to a full withdrawal from the Golan
Heights, which they captured in 1967, but Israel disputes that.

BRUINS SIGN THREE; STATUS QUO ON DAFOE

<P>
   BOSTON -- As the clock ticks to the opening of training camp,
with all the Bruins on the ice together Sunday for the first time,
the club added three players to the fold Thursday. However, none of
them was free agent netminder Byron Dafoe, who said he will leave
town for his offseason home in Southern California this weekend if
no agreement can be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as the tension rises on that front, it was defused on
another as Boston signed goaltender John Grahame to a one-year
contract, defenseman Mattias Timander to a two-year deal, and left
wing Antti Laaksonen to a one-year pact.
</P>
<P>
   Grahame, who was a key reason the Providence Bruins won the
Calder Cup last season, is coming off a career year. He led the
American Hockey League in wins with a 37-9-1 record and set an AHL
mark with a 19-game winning streak. He tied an AHL mark for
postseason victories with a 15-4 record and 2.38 goals-against
average in 19 playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   Laaksonen was another big contributor to the Baby B's with 58
points in 66 games and led the AHL with a plus-40 rating. In two
recalls to Boston last year, Laaksonen had a goal and two assists.
Timander spent the first half of last season with Providence and
was recalled Feb. 10 to Boston, where he remained the rest of the
year and came on strong in the end.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Hal Gill and left wing P.J. Axelsson, both restricted
free agents, remain unsigned with the players' demands far
different than the team's offers. Neither is expected for the
beginning of camp.

TO EASE TENSIONS, NYC PLANS SMALLER POLICE PRESENCE AT
CONTROVERSIAL RALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Police Commissioner Howard Safir on Thursday
reassured anxious neighborhood leaders in Harlem that there would
be a substantially reduced police presence at this year's Million
Youth March.
</P>
<P>
   His pledge marked a retreat from the city's hard-edged stance
toward the organizers of the youth rally, particularly Khallid
Abdul Muhammad, whom Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has accused of
fomenting bigotry and violence by disparaging Jews and whites.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said the police presence would be reduced to comply with
both the desires of neighborhood leaders and the orders of two
courts, which ruled this week that the rally can go forward. Prior
to those court orders, Giuliani and other city officials had
pledged to use the full force of the Police Department to oversee
the event, which last year ended in violent clashes between police
and hundreds of rally participants.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood leaders, while condemning the rally as the
handiwork of anti-Semitic ``outsiders,'' said Thursday that they
were even more afraid that police would repeat the ``heavy-handed''
and ``insulting'' enforcement of last year's march. The enforcement
included squads of officers in riot gear, still more on horses and
in helicopters, and hundreds of barricades that severely restricted
the demonstrators' freedom of movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want community-friendly policing in which we are not
treated as the hostile enemy,'' said City Councilman Bill Perkins,
who last week said he had been assaulted by rally organizers and is
one of several Harlem politicians who have called upon residents to
boycott the march, scheduled to take place from noon to 4 p.m.
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel of Harlem, who had also called for a
boycott, said, ``We don't want to get hit on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with Perkins and other neighborhood leaders Thursday
morning at the Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building in
Harlem, Safir said that the event would be patrolled by fewer than
half the 3,000 or so officers who were assigned to last year's
Million Youth March. Safir also said that the officers would not
wear riot gear, nor would platoons of mounted officers be sent to
the rally area, on Malcolm X Boulevard between 118th and 124th
Streets.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Safir told the group, subway service to Harlem
would not be cut off as it was last year, and police helicopters
would not swoop over the rally, a tactic that provoked intense
criticism from many quarters.
</P>
<P>
   On another sore point, Safir said that a minimal number of
barricades would be used for crowd control, according to those who
were at the meeting. At last year's event, those who attended the
rally were directed into large barricade pens _ ``cattle chutes,''
they were called _ and some residents complained that they were
completely cut off from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, Perkins said, Safir offered assurances that
police officers would not rush the rally stage at the end of the
event, as they did within a minute or two of last year's
agreed-upon ending time. ``They made it clear,'' Perkins said of
Safir and his aides, ``that they would not bum rush the parade the
way they did last time around.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters, Safir said of the meeting, ``There was
not great support for this march, but there was concern that both
sides act reasonably. We intend to act reasonably. We intend to
have adequate police presence up there to make sure this is a safe
event. We would ask that Khallid Muhammad and his people do the
same.''

ARMY DEMOTES RETIRED GENERAL FOR ADULTEROUS AFFAIRS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the first action of its kind, the Army on
Thursday demoted a retired general who admitted during his
court-martial in March that he had adulterous affairs with the
wives of four subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Maj. Gen. David Hale, who was the Army's deputy
inspector general and commander of NATO forces in southern Europe,
was demoted to a one-star brigadier general by Louis Caldera, the
secretary of the Army. The demotion will include a reduction of
nearly $9,000 in Hale's annual pension of $75,744.
</P>
<P>
   Hale said through his lawyer that he would appeal the decision.
``It is my belief that Congress never authorized the secretaries of
the Army, Air Force and Navy to take this kind of action against a
retired officer,'' said Frank Spinner, the attorney for Hale.
</P>
<P>
   Hale retired with honor in February 1998 after he denied charges
of adultery brought against him by one of his subordinate's wives.
He had served only four months as deputy inspector general when the
Army granted his request to retire despite the outstanding
complaint accusing him of an improper sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The Army was immediately accused of employing a double standard
of allowing senior officers to escape punishment for sexual
misconduct that could lead to more rigorous prosecution of junior
officers or enlisted personnel. The criticism, especially from
Congress, led the secretary of defense, William Cohen, to order a
change in the military's policy that prevented officers accused of
misconduct from retiring until the charges had been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Hale's retirement, the Army continued its investigation
and found cause for a court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   At the court-martial in March, Hale pleaded guilty to eight
counts of misconduct including lying to his superiors about his
affairs just one month before his retirement in February.
</P>
<P>
   Hale was ordered to pay $22,000 in penalties.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Caldera then convened a special review board of three
generals to determine if Hale should be demoted. The generals made
their unanimous recommendation last month to reduce Hale's rank,
which Caldera accepted Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera's decision was greeted with approval by some of the
loudest congressional critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased that Secretary Caldera closed the Hale case on a
high note of justice,'' said Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine. ``This
proportionate punishment sends a clear signal that the enforcement
of regulations against sexual harassment must remain blind to rank
or privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   In July Snowe wrote to Caldera asking that the Army reduce
Hale's rank. She underlined how Army Master Sgt. Gene McKinney, the
service's highest-ranking enlisted officer, had suffered a
reduction in rank for what she described as a less serious
conviction in 1998, creating the impression that commanders ``can
enjoy the material benefits of their authority after systematically
abusing it.'' McKinney was convicted on one count of obstruction of
justice stemming from a court-martial in which he was cleared of
sexually harassing six servicewomen.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, when he was first charged with sexual misconduct, Hale
accused one of the wives, Donnamaria Carpino, of trying to stalk
him and sued her for defamation of character. At his court-martial
in March he apologized for his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carpino has asked the Army to reimburse her for the $26,000
she spent defending herself against the defamation suit that Hale
later withdrew after admitting to the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Hale is only the second Army general to face court-martial since
Congress enacted the Uniform Code of Military Justice in 1951. In
1952, Maj. Gen. Robert Grow, the military attache in Moscow, was
tried on charges of dereliction of duty and was suspended from
command for six months.
</P>
<P>
   In his case, Hale had overlapping adulterous affairs with the
wives of four subordinates while he was deputy commanding general
of NATO forces in southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Hale, 54, married Melina Maka, one of the wives with
whom he had an affair. Her former husband is Maj. Brian Maka who
worked for Hale in Ismir, Turkey.

ADVERTISING: DEWAR'S PUSHES IMAGE OF FREE SPIRITS TO LURE YOUNG
DRINKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By WESTRAY BATTLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeking to reverse a decline in sales for Dewar's Scotch whisky,
Bacardi-Martini USA plans to introduce two campaigns this fall, one
to attract younger drinkers and another to update the Highlander,
its more than 150-year-old icon.
</P>
<P>
   The new ads, with a budget of more than $20 million in the first
year, were created by Avrett, Free &AMP; Ginsberg in New York, part of
the Bozell Worldwide unit of True North Communications. Print and
outdoor promotions will emphasize the willingness of Dewar's
drinkers to follow their passions and take risks. They present
profiles of hip Dewar's drinkers like the makers of the hit film
``The Blair Witch Project.'' Other ads show the Highlander with
accessories like a surfboard and an iron.
</P>
<P>
   Bacardi-Martini is looking for a lift for Dewar's because
shipments to retailers declined 5.8 percent last year, to 1.4
million cases, according to the Impact Databank annual distilled
spirits survey, published by M. Shanken Communications in New York.
Total scotch shipments have declined 31.3 percent, to 8.3 million
cases since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketing of scotch is an uphill climb because it will
always be an acquired taste,'' said Bob Keane, editorial director
at Adams Business Media in New York, which tracks the performance
of the liquor industry. ``But it is important for Dewar's and the
rest of the industry to become more relevant for younger adults.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wait long enough, everything becomes hip again,'' Keane
added. ``Young people have already begun to reach into the past,
drinking more martinis and manhattans,'' suggesting that scotch
could make a comeback, too.
</P>
<P>
   Each of Averett, Free's campaigns updates a previously
successful marketing tactic and tries to revitalize the Dewar's
brand while maintaining its 19th-century heritage and tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Avrett, Free created two campaigns. The first offers five
profiles of young people who have ``taken the road less traveled,''
said Avrett, Free chairman and chief executive Frank Ginsberg. It
is a revival of the ``Dewar's Profiles'' campaign, created by Leo
Burnett Co. in Chicago in 1969, which ran until 1993. The profiles
will appear in publications like ESPN magazine, GQ, Men's Journal,
Playboy and Rolling Stone.
</P>
<P>
   One ad features the filmmakers and star of ``The Blair Witch
Project.'' Actress Heather Donahue and directors Eduardo Sanchez
and Daniel Myrich appear as if they are about to be burned at the
stake. Below the picture, the caption reads, ``They staked it all .
. . They're Dewars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're smart and adventurous,'' says Marshall Dawson,
marketing manager at Bacardi-Martini in Miami, which bought the
rights to the Dewar's brand from Diageo PLC last year. ``They want
to take risks and follow their dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   The new campaign will align itself in other ways with the film
by celebrating the start of the campaign on Halloween at the spooky
Renwick Ruins on New York City's Roosevelt Island with the people
featured in all the ads, including the movie's other two stars,
Josh Leonard and Michael Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Other profiles include three upstarts who started their own snow
ski company, Igneous Skis, which has the tagline, ``They're
fighting an uphill battle . . . They're Dewars,'' and the two
creators of the board game Cranium, who left a potential fortune at
Microsoft, with the tagline, ``They're out of their minds . . .
They're Dewars.''
</P>
<P>
   The second campaign, which will run at the same time, focuses on
Dewar's White Label Scotch and its heritage by changing the image
of the brand's icon since 1846, the Highlander.
</P>
<P>
   The Highlander had always been depicted as a traditional
kilt-clad Scotsman. The new ads draw the Highlander in funny poses,
shedding his traditional garb for more modern pursuits. He is shown
``Perfectly Balanced,'' in a martial arts pose, ``Smooth,'' ironing
his kilt and ``Just add water,'' shirtless, wearing sunglasses and
holding a surfboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to say, `You, too, can be a part of this spirit if
you drink Dewar's,'' said Avrett, Free group director Toby Dunn.

 &HT;    Revenge: Drivers downplay retaliation but history suggests
otherwise
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the 1987 Winston race in Charlotte, N.C., NASCAR
driver Bill Elliott slammed into Dale Earnhardt's car during a
victory lap because Elliott was incensed about bumping from
Earnhardt late in the race.
</P>
<P>
   At Bristol in 1995, Rusty Wallace hit Earnhardt in the head with
a plastic water bottle after Earnhardt wrecked Wallace early in the
race.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, at Watkins Glen, Sterling Marlin was fined
$5,000 after purposely running his car into Chad Little's car as
they approached the finish line, seconds after the race had been
determined.
</P>
<P>
   So the latest controversy between Earnhardt and Terry Labonte is
nothing new, especially for a sport that traces its defining moment
to Daytona in 1979. Then, a post-race fist fight between Cale
Yarborough and Bobby Allison became the highlight of the first
nationally televised live race.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, NASCAR officials are taking the latest flap seriously.
Earnhardt was booed by thousands of fans at Bristol on Saturday
night, when he won the Goody's 500 by pushing race leader Labonte
into the wall on the final lap.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR rules state that it is illegal to intentionally cause
another car to wreck, and most drivers believe that Earnhardt got
away with one. NASCAR rules also state that it is illegal to exact
revenge against another driver on the track, but most drivers think
it could happen as early as Sunday, when Darlington Raceway holds
its 50th Southern 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Earnhardt) had better tighten his (seat) belts,'' Labonte
said after the Bristol race.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they get together again, I'd say Earnhardt's got him a
neck-stretching coming,'' Marlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt has taken the criticism in stride. Known as ``The
Intimidator,'' he has forged a career under a win-at-all-costs
philosophy. Earlier this year, he bumped his son, Dale Jr., out of
the way to win a Busch race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll apologize to Terry and do what we've got to do,''
Earnhardt said. ``If he sees he's got to stretch my neck like
Sterling Marlin says, we'll just have to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte has calmed down since the wreck, but he says he has lost
some respect for Earnhardt, a seven-time Winston Cup champion.
</P>
<P>
   Revenge, referred to as ``payback'' in the garages, is always a
major concern for NASCAR and its drivers. The sport's governing
body was heavily criticized for allowing Earnhardt to keep the
Bristol victory and claims to have an absolute ban on such acts.
Each case is reviewed individually, but punishments range from race
suspensions to deduction of points in the Winston Cup points
standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is talk of revenge in the garage area, our drivers
are the ones who are going to weed it out,'' NASCAR spokesman Tim
Sullivan said. ``They are not going to stand for it. With the
speeds these guys are traveling, there is no place at the track for
revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   In the old days of stock-car racing, before drivers jetted to
races and corporations paid $10 million to sponsor cars, revenge
was more common.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, if you hit somebody, you could expect to be hit
back; that was pretty much the way things worked out then,''
veteran driver Dave Marcis said. ``You see some of that today, and
sometimes you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   It often depends on the drivers. ``Everybody has their own way
of handling things,'' Kevin Lepage said. ``We spend more time with
our fellow racers than we do with our neighbors, because we're on
the road and the track so long. I can't believe there is something
like (revenge) going on.''
</P>
<P>
   If Labonte chooses to retaliate for the Bristol incident, he
would have less noticeable ways than causing a wreck. Drivers say
the most popular revenge is making it hard for another driver to
pass at any time during a race. That form of payback can last for
years.

   ``I think payback exists,'' said Ned Jarrett, a retired two-time
Cup champion. ``Most of the time when it (happens later), it has
been forgotten by the fans, media and people in racing. The drivers
know, though. I think that there have been paybacks in the past and
will continue to be paybacks in the future.''

never really matched the reality, and, in recent days, the
disclosures that the FBI failed to produce information from its

on the Branch Davidian compound has split open a jagged seam of

EXCERPTS FROM BUSH'S SPEECH ON IMPROVING EDUCATION  
(WITH: BUSH-EDUC)
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from a speech on education policy given
Thursday by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to the Latin Business
Association, as recorded by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   In coming weeks, I plan to talk about safety in our schools, the
character of our children, education standards we should set and
the accountability we should expect.
</P>
<P>
   But I want to start where educational failure has had its
highest price. I want to begin with disadvantaged children in
struggling schools, and the federal role in helping them. ... No
child in America should be segregated by low expectations,
imprisoned by illiteracy, abandoned to frustration and darkness of
self-doubt. ...
</P>
<P>
   Now some say it is unfair to hold disadvantaged children to
rigorous standards. I say it is discrimination to require anything
less _ the soft bigotry of low expectations. ...
</P>
<P>
   It is a scandal of the first order when the average test scores
of African-American and Latino students at age 17 are roughly the
same as white 13-year-old's. Whatever the cause, the effect is
discrimination. Children who never master reading will never master
learning. They will face a life of frustration on the fringes of
society. ...
</P>
<P>
   For many years the federal government has tried to close the gap
of hope, armed with good intentions and billions of dollars. ... My
administration will do things differently. ...
</P>
<P>
   We will start by funding only what works in education, only
those methods and ideas that prove their power to close the
achievement gap. ...
</P>
<P>
   My administration will require every federal program _ in
teacher training, curriculum research, school safety _ to prove
results. If it cannot, we will shift the money into a program that
is using it wisely. ... My administration will reform Head Start
programs and aggressively emphasize early reading skills. ...
</P>
<P>
   And each time a Head Start contract is up for renewal, we will
subject that site to an independent evaluation to make sure they
are successfully putting our children on the track to learning and
literacy. If not, the operation of a Head Start site will be put up
for competitive bidding, allowing someone else _ including churches
and synagogues and community groups _ to serve our children in
better fashion. ...
</P>
<P>
   My plan will make sure that every school getting Title 1 funds
tests its disadvantaged students on the academic basics every year.
... If disadvantaged children in a school are not making progress,
the school will be warned that it is failing. ...
</P>
<P>
   If, at the end of three years, there is still no progress, its
Title 1 funds will be divided up, matched by other federal
education money given to the state, and made directly available to
parents, coming to about $1,500 per year. This money can then be
used by students for tutoring, for a charter school, for a working
public school in a different district, for a private school,
whatever their parents choose _ for whatever offers hope.

 &HT;    Stefan remains unsigned to Thrashers; goalie Langkow has deal
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the majority of Thrashers arrive in Orlando,
Fla., for team photos today, a significant part of their future
will be missing.
</P>
<P>
   In what is shaping up as not quite the Kodak moment the team had
hoped for, top draft pick Patrik Stefan remained unsigned Thursday,
increasing the possibility he will miss the beginning of training
camp.
</P>
<P>
   Thrashers general manager Don Waddell said Stefan still could be
signed in time for the team's first practice Sunday at the RDV
Sportsplex, but admitted he and agent Steve Kotlowitz are no closer
to a deal than they were Tuesday, when both sides had indicated an
agreement was close.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fairly close, but the problem now is we've taken our
ground as far as we can take it and (Kotlowitz) says the same
thing,'' Waddell said before boarding a flight for Orlando. ``We
have to find a way to resolve it. But to be honest with you, I
don't know how we respond at this point. I don't know who gives
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Waddell had only a brief conversation with Kotlowitz early
Thursday and planned to talk to him again late Thursday night or
this morning. In the mean time, Stefan remained home in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The hangup in the three-year, $3.075 million deal is the bonus
structure. Kotlowitz is seeking to top last year's record deal for
rookies by Tampa Bay's Vincent Lecavalier. Waddell is looking to
tie some individual bonuses to team incentives.
</P>
<P>
   The day wasn't a total loss for Waddell. The Thrashers came to
terms with goalie Scott Langkow, leaving Stefan as the last
unsigned player. Langkow, acquired from Phoenix in an expansion
draft trade, signed a two-year, two-way deal with an option for a
third season that kicks in if he plays 45 NHL games. Langkow's NHL
salary was slightly raised from last year's $360,000. He will make
$125,000 to $150,000 in the minors.

<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ One year ago, a woman stared out at the
cold North Atlantic waves where her husband died in the crash of
Swissair Flight 111. She quietly handed her baby to a policeman,
and then started running. Just before she could throw herself into
the sea, another policeman caught her.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, on the first anniversary of the crash that killed all
229 people aboard the New York-to-Geneva flight, about 700
relatives returned here to submit themselves to another calvary of
wrenching emotions.
</P>
<P>
   As a bagpiper played ``Dark Island,'' they buried 27 coffins,
containing mostly unidentified partial remains of victims, in a
hillside park. Across St. Margaret's Bay, on a bare bluff of
glacial boulders and low bush blueberries, they inaugurated a
granite memorial incised, ``They have been joined to the sea and
the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, in bobbing fishing boats, family members and religious
leaders consecrated the crash site, watching as a hovering
helicopter dropped a wreath into the waves. Later, some relatives
toured a military hangar where the jet's cockpit is being
reconstructed from fragments the size of silver dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Miles Gerety, whose older brother, Pierce, died in the crash,
prepared himself for this emotional week by sailing here from
Mystic, Conn. His companion for the three-day voyage was his
brother's son, also named Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, it was so messy and painful,'' recalled Gerety, a
lawyer who is president of the International Association of
Families of Swissair Flight 111, Inc., representing relatives of
the victims. ``This week, seeing the memorial put up, seeing the
remains buried in a beautiful place, has given people a bit of
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, family members said here that their spirits were
buoyed by the decency and kindness of the people of Nova Scotia. On
Wednesday, as the motorcade of 26 buses filled with family members
made its way down a winding country lane to the memorial site,
local residents stood solemnly on their porches, some holding
handmade signs, inscribed: ``Flight 111, we will always remember.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``That is one of the most touching things I have ever seen,''
said Peggy Coburn, of New Jersey, who lost her husband, Richard, in
the crash.
</P>
<P>
   For a city that buried 150 impoverished victims of the Titanic
sinking in 1912, Halifax responded to the Swissair disaster with
the quiet understanding of a community that still draws its
lifeblood from the sea. After watching family members place flowers
on seashore rocks last fall, Bob Quinn, a Halifax songwriter, was
inspired to write, ``Roses on the Rocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Arsenault, a Royal Canadian Mounted Police inspector, sang
the words: ``When dreams get tossed, we'll share the cost, and lay
the roses on the rocks.''
</P>
<P>
   His red dress uniform contrasted with the gray memorial, a chunk
of quarried granite shaped to look like a boulder split in two.
Facing the sea, the two halves cup three stone benches. The
memorial, the burial site and the crash site form an equilateral
triangle.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In this bay of lobster fishermen, life has gradually returned to
normal as the search area has been reduced from 150 square miles a
year ago to 4 square miles today. But, though tourists frolic in
warm, shallow water along the beaches, some local residents are
reluctant to venture into the water, noting that crash items washed
up on the shores as recently as last week.
</P>
<P>
   Work continues on the investigation, which has already cost $42
million, making it the most expensive in Canadian history.
</P>
<P>
   While 90 percent of the aircraft has been recovered, only a
small portion of the cockpit has been found. Fragments recovered
from just behind the cockpit door contain drops of molten aluminum
alloy, a metal that melts at 1,220 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   By studying pieces of burned metal, investigators hope to map
the progression of the fire, and trace it to its source. A final
report may take another two years, estimated Jim Harris, spokesman
for the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   On a parallel track, a federal Judge in Philadelphia, James
Giles, is working to consolidate many of the lawsuits in the case,
estimated to be about 175. Most of these suits, which are demanding
a total of $16 billion, are lodged against Swissair, Boeing and
Delta. Boeing owns McDonnell Douglas, the manufacturer of the
airplane, an MD-11. Through an arrangement with Swissair, Delta
sold tickets to 65 people on the flight, about one third of the
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies for the defendant companies are expected to
pay for the human losses. But cargo shippers may have to fall back
on their own insurance as Swissair's standard cargo insurance
amounts to only $10 a kilogram, or 2.2 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   One major loss was a Picasso painting, a version of ``Le
Peintre,'' valued at $1.5 million. After the crash, searchers
recovered part of the frame and a scrap of the canvas.
</P>
<P>
   The jet also carried a two-pound package of diamonds. These
diamonds have been lost to the sea.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Betty Fox of Queens, N.Y., 1998 got off to a bad start. In
February, Mrs. Fox, now 69, retired when her employer, a medical
billing company, relocated. To help her avoid boredom, her older
son, Marty, set her up with WebTV so she could surf the Internet on
her television set. That led to more frustration for Mrs. Fox, who
knew little about computers and nothing about the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Her first online visit was to search for a new recipe for peach
pie. She typed ``peaches'' into a search engine and came up with
85,870 pages.
</P>
<P>
   That was fun, at least at first. ``I felt like I had just won at
bingo,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her elation soon turned to disbelief, however, when she found
that she had called up far more than she had bargained for,
including pornographic sites involving women named Peaches. She
also found sites having to do with peach wholesalers in South
America.
</P>
<P>
   Then she decided to search for sites that would be of help to
``seniors.'' The search engine turned up some useful sites, but
also thousands of others, many involving high school and college
seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Fox, who has a penchant for alphabetized lists, was
appalled at the disorder and imprecision of the online world. And
she suspected that she was not the only older person struggling to
cope with it. ``I just knew there had to be a better way,'' she
said. ``Especially for people like me who didn't know Internet from
schminternet. Everything seemed such a hodgepodge.''
</P>
<P>
   So Mrs. Fox, a widow and grandmother, decided to take action.
With the help of the son who had given her the WebTV and works in
the technology field, she started her own site
(www.grandmabetty.com) for people over 50. It went on line in
September 1998 and contains original material plus hundred of links
to other sites, all selected by Mrs. Fox based on what she thinks
are its visitors' interests.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are many commercial, nonprofit and
governmental Web sites for older people, run by entities as diverse
as AARP (www.aarp.org) and Microsoft (www.microsoft.com/seniors).
But for scope, ease of use and relevance, few sites can match
grandmabetty.com. Not to mention orderliness and precision. The
site can send you directly to the pie recipes, without the
pornography.
</P>
<P>
   The home page displays a photograph of her holding her grandson,
David, when he was a baby. Above it is a list of areas on the site,
including ``Ask Grandma,'' where people can send her e-mail.
Another, called Sponsors, invites ads for the site, but Mrs. Fox
has since decided that she will not accept advertising; she wants
her site _ essentially her hobby _ to be objective, although, of
course, many links contain ads. She says she has turned down
advertising for products like vitamins and promotions for sites
selling Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the site's categories offer very good lists of links.
Under investing, there are links to scores of sites, from American
Express to Ziegler Thrift Trading, an online brokerage firm.

JOB TESTING: MULTIPLE CHOICES 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Sept. 5) 
(jt) 
 By MICHELLE COTTLE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today, the cost of hiring the wrong person can be steep. Your
company is thinking of introducing tests to screen applicants. With
so many kinds of tests available, how do you decide which ones to
use?
</P>
<P>
   No doubt about it: Employment tests are hot. The Association of
Test Publishers estimates that personality testing is now a $400
million industry, and the Society for Human Resource Management
estimates that more than 20 percent of its members use some kind of
pre-employment testing. There are tests to gauge an applicant's
honesty, creativity, technology skills, communications skills _ you
name it. But before you start shelling out money, determine just
how much information you really need.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably not worth your while to ask retail-clerk
applicants to take an extensive (and expensive) battery of tests,
said David Arnold, an industrial psychologist and lawyer with Reid
Psychological Systems, a Chicago-based company that develops
employment tests. For many positions, a basic skills or aptitude
test may suffice. For jobs in which security is an issue, a more
comprehensive personality assessment may be desirable, Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in time and cost can be considerable. According
to Roger Sommer, employment committee chair for the Society for
Human Resources Management, some basic tests can last about 10
minutes and cost just $5 to $10 an applicant, while executive
testing can take most of a day and run into the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   John Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray, &AMP;
Christmas, an outplacement firm in Chicago, says that to find out
what to test for, talk with managers who have been hiring for that
type of job. ``Get a good handle on what it is that makes people in
the job successful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold recommended asking three basic questions when choosing a
test publisher. First, has the test been validated? The company
should have evidence that people who score well on the evaluation
tend to be good performers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Second, is the test fair? Has the publisher followed legal or
professional standards, like Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission guidelines, to insure that the test does not
discriminate against applicants of a particular race, sex or age?
</P>
<P>
   Third, if your use of the test ever faces a legal challenge, how
will the publisher help you? At the very least, Arnold said, the
company should provide a psychologist, at no cost to you, to help
you develop a response to the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from legal issues, some of the more comprehensive tests
include questions that some people might regard as intrusive. The
less clearly that test questions deal with job-related behavior,
the greater the risk of alienating applicants, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly in fields like information technology, in which the
demand for qualified applicants far outpaces supply, he said, you
run the risk of making the process so rigorous that applicants ask,
``Why in the world do I want to go through all of this?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Americans indulge in the last great driving
binge of summer, they are paying an average of 22 cents a gallon
more for gasoline than they were around Labor Day of 1998, says the
Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   The average retail price for regular unleaded gasoline was $1.23
cents a gallon as of Monday, compared with $1.01 on Aug. 31, 1998,
the department's Energy Information Administration said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline prices, which as recently as February were at an
average of 90 to 92 cents a gallon, have risen 12 cents a gallon
since June. The increases are being felt everywhere, although for a
variety of reasons gasoline continues to be most expensive in the
Far West and least expensive in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The American Automobile Association said that as of last week
the average per-gallon price for unleaded gasoline in New Jersey
was $1.17, compared with $1.32 in New York state and $1.37 in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the higher prices are not keeping people at home _
the Automobile Association expects nearly 35 million Americans to
travel 100 or more miles this weekend _ but they have produced
grumblings at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know that we have to use our cars, have to get to work,''
Daniella Gobert complained the other day as she gassed her 1985
Oldsmobile at a Shell station in San Francisco, where the price of
regular unleaded has soared to more than $1.50 a gallon and the
premium price is flirting with $2. ``I don't believe we're getting
gas for cheap, if that's what they're saying.''
</P>
<P>
   By ``they,'' Ms. Gobert and legions of fellow complainers mean
the big oil companies. And, yes, the oil industry says gasoline is
still a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   To Mike Libbey, a spokesman for Chevron U.S.A., the complaints
reflect two misconceptions. ``One is that gasoline prices are
high,'' Libbey said, ``and the other is that we control all that.
If we controlled them, they'd stay up. But they go up, and they go
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The AAA said the average price for self-service regular unleaded
gasoline has simply returned to its levels of August 1996 and
August 1997, when it was almost exactly what it was a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
   The AAA gets its data from the Oil Price Information Service
newsletter, whose figures, because of sampling methods and timing,
were slightly different from the Energy Department's. The
association said the average increase from a year ago was about 18
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Discrepancies notwithstanding, the trend is unmistakable, and
people who work in or follow the oil industry offered several
reasons. For one, prices often rise before a summer holiday, when
demand goes up.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the 11 members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed March 23 to cut the production
of crude oil by 3 percent effective April 1. And the cartel
persuaded Norway, Mexico, Oman and Russian, four oil exporters that
do not belong to OPEC, to go along.
</P>
<P>
   The OPEC countries were reacting to an abundance of crude oil
that had driven down prices on the world markets.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Last December, U.S. refiners paid just under $10 a barrel for
crude oil, the lowest price price since the Great Depression when
adjusted for inflation, according to Ron Planting, an American
Petroleum Institute expert on gasoline-price fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
   By June, U.S. refiners were paying $16 a barrel, the effect was
being passed along the fuel chain, to American drivers. Now, crude
oil sells for about $20 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There has been grumbling even in Georgia where, despite the
price upsurge, self-service unleaded gasoline cost only $1.09 a
gallon in late August, the lowest average price in the country. ``I
don't like it,'' said Gregg Richey, who was gassing up in Atlanta.
``Gas is a major expense in Atlanta, where you're commuting long
distances.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason why Georgia has low prices is its tax of only 7.5
cents a gallon, the lowest state levy in the country. New Jersey's
state tax on gasoline is 14.5 cents a gallon, New York's is 29.8
cents and Connecticut's is 32 cents, the highest in the country.
(The federal tax is 18.4 cents.)
</P>
<P>
   California's state gasoline tax is 18 cents a gallon, and there
is an additional sales tax of 7 cents a gallon. Californians pay
some of the highest prices anywhere: $1.55 a gallon for
self-service regular unleaded, according to the Automobile
Association. Only Oregon, which has a state tax of 24 cents and
like New Jersey does not allow self-service, had a higher average
per-gallon price in late August, $1.56.
</P>
<P>
   California's strict air-quality rules, which demand
cleaner-burning gasoline that costs more to refine, also keep
prices high. Gasoline usually costs more in hilly San Francisco,
where service stations are relatively scarce because of zoning
restrictions and a shortage of suitable open land, than it does in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas F. Hogarty, an adjunct professor of economics at Virginia
Technical Institute who has studied the petroleum industry for many
years, said Asia's renewed economic prosperity, and the greater oil
consumption that goes with it, have pushed up crude oil prices. So
have several recent refinery fires and pipeline accidents in the
Far West, which curtailed supplies in the region and reduced the
oil available to other areas.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The American Petroleum Institute and the individual oil
companies insist that gasoline is inexpensive compared with the
price of the many others things people need. The Consumer Price
Index published by the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor
Statistics supports their argument.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Price Index for July showed that gasoline prices
had risen nearly 19 percent since December but were still 14.2
percent lower than they were in November 1990, after Iraq invaded
Kuwait, and lower than they were from October 1995 through April
1997.
</P>
<P>
   A comparison of gasoline prices to those of other commodities
tracked in the Consumer Price Index was striking. According to the
index, the cost of a wide range of goods and services used in
everyday life rose by two-thirds from a base period of 1982-84 to
July 1999. In other words, a shopping basket of goods that cost
$100 about 15 years ago would have cost $166.70 in July.
</P>
<P>
   But the price of gasoline was only 1.9 percent higher in actual
dollars than it was about 15 years ago. The same amount of gasoline
that cost $10 then would have cost $10.19 in July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the recent price increases have upset some
truckers, whose diesel-fuel costs have also risen, and they have
produced calls for official investigations in some states,
including Oregon and Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Hogarty thinks prices will remain fairly stable and
could even decline again, as they typically do after a big travel
holiday. Historically, he said, the OPEC has had trouble keeping
discipline among its members, some of whom (Iran, Iraq, Kuwait)
have warred upon one another. If individual members cheat and
produce more oil, there could be another glut.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Hogarty conceded, another war in the Middle
East could send prices skyrocketing. Or perhaps something closer to
home, he suggested, saying, ``God forbid a huge hurricane should
hit some refineries along the Gulf Coast.''

 Three D.A.s File Suit Against Pac Bell
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Deborah Solomon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Three district attorneys filed a lawsuit against Pacific Bell
yesterday, alleging that the company gave customers false and
deceptive information to increase its sales of products and
services such as Caller ID, three-way-calling and inside-wiring
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In a suit filed in Alameda County Superior Court, district
attorneys from San Mateo, Alameda and Monterey counties said Pac
Bell is violating the state's unfair-business practices act and
should be forced to stop.
</P>
<P>
   The suit asks for at least $20 million in fines, plus
restitution for customers who were misled by Pac Bell into ordering
or changing a service. SBC Communications Inc., the parent company
of Pac Bell, also is named in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints in the suit are similar to ones lodged by
consumer groups against Pac Bell last year. Those complaints
prompted six days of hearings at the state Public Utilities
Commission in December, but no decision on that case has been
reached.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell denied the allegations and said they merely rehash
old complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``The accusations being made here are nothing new. It's all been
litigated over there at the PUC,'' Pac Bell spokesman John Britton
said. ``We're kind of perplexed really that (the district
attorneys) wouldn't wait to see what the PUC would decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Lydia Villarreal, deputy district attorney for Monterey, said
the suit is independent of the PUC investigation and was prompted
by complaints from customers and consumer groups across California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the gravity of the problem and the enormity of the
continuing violations, we felt we had to take action,'' Villarreal
said.
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges that:
</P>
<P>
   _To increase sales of Caller ID _ a box that hooks to a phone
and identifies the number of incoming calls _ Pac Bell hired a
telemarketing firm that allegedly misled customers about their
ability to have their numbers blocked on Caller ID systems.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell's sales of Caller ID have been slow because about 44
percent of Californians have requested ``complete blocking,'' which
prevents their own phone numbers from appearing on other peoples'
Caller ID boxes.
</P>
<P>
   State law requires that all phone companies offer complete
blocking as a free service. But the telemarketing firm, Business
Response Inc. of St. Louis, allegedly told Pac Bell customers that
complete blocking no longer existed or soon would be discontinued
and that they would have to switch to ``selective blocking,'' which
requires callers to dial 67 each time they make a call to block
their phone number from Caller ID boxes.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100,000 customers switched from ``complete blocking''
to ``selective blocking'' following calls from BRI, said Thomas
Orloff, the Alameda County district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   After The Chronicle published a story about BRI in December, Pac
Bell canceled its contract with the telemarketer, saying it did not
condone the company's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But yesterday, the district attorneys produced internal Pac Bell
documents outlining a three-year marketing plan to ``overcome''
customer objections to Caller ID. Pac Bell stated that its goal was
to increase Caller ID penetration from 2 percent to 30 percent by
1999 _ which would increase the company's revenue by $210 million.
</P>
<P>
   One Pac Bell document stated that the company's goal was to
market selective blocking ``under the radar screen'' of consumer
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the evidence shows that the defendant elevated
corporate profits above the privacy interests of customers,''
Orloff said.
</P>
<P>
   BRI also was named as a defendant in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   _To sell more add-on features, the company allegedly directed
its employees to use misleading names such as ``The Basics'' and
``The Essentials'' for expensive calling packages with nonessential
features like three-way calling, call forwarding and distinctive
ringing.
</P>
<P>
   The suit said Pac Bell also directed service representatives to
make ``personal recommendations,'' supposedly based on an
individual's calling habits, that ``always end with the
recommendation that the consumer purchase more custom calling
services.''
</P>
<P>
   Britton said the name ``The Basics'' has been approved by the
PUC and that its use did not mislead customers.
</P>
<P>
   _The company attempted to increases sales of inside-wiring
insurance by failing to tell renters they did not need to purchase
it and by offering a cheaper inside-wiring plan only after
customers rejected a higher priced one.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also said Pac Bell failed to tell customers they can
get inside-wiring repairs done by companies other than Pacific
Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Britton said it is not Pac Bell's responsibility to inform
customers that they can go elsewhere for inside-wiring repairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go down to Montgomery Ward to buy a washer-dryer, do they
tell me that I can also buy a washer-dryer at Sears? It's not our
responsibility to educate customers about all their options. It's a
competitive world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Pac Bell disputed all the charges, saying the
company did not mislead customers and has not engaged in deceptive
practices.
</P>
<P>
   But James Fox, San Mateo district attorney, said an extensive
investigation by the three counties proves that Pac Bell
systematically has been violating customers' rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pac Bell says, `The phone is your friend,' but the phone
company has not been a friend to consumers,'' Fox said. ``It's a
shame when corporate greed overcomes the obligations of a public
utility to protect the public.''

 Microsoft Tabs Belluzzo to Head Net Units
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Tom Stein &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Microsoft Corp. tapped former Silicon Graphics Inc. chief executive
Richard Belluzzo yesterday to run its Internet operations, just as
the company is poised to do battle over all things Web-related.
Belluzzo, 45, will take on the role of group vice president for
Microsoft's Consumer and Commerce Group, the unit charged with
spearheading the company's Internet efforts. Under Belluzzo's
purview will be the Microsoft Network, WebTV and all e-commerce
initiatives such as Expedia and Car Point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had some fits and starts as well as a lot of progress
in our Internet efforts,'' Microsoft President Steve Ballmer said
in a conference call yesterday. ``Rick (Belluzzo) is a great leader
and a focused and intense business manager ... who will complement
our online team.''
</P>
<P>
   Belluzzo will report directly to Ballmer, while Brad Chase and
Jon DeVaan, who formerly held the reigns of the Consumer and
Commerce Group, now will report to Belluzzo. Both Chase and DeVaan
were promoted from vice presidents to senior vice presidents
yesterday. Together, the three will form the core of Microsoft's
Internet division, which accounted for $2.4 billion of the
company's $19.7 billion in annual sales in fiscal year 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about the opportunity to be part of Microsoft and
contribute to its online business,'' said Belluzzo. ``Brad and Jon
have laid out the foundation, and with my leadership, we plan to
extend that and deliver a rich consumer experience on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Belluzzo also pooh-poohed suggestions that he is not well-suited
to Microsoft because all his previous experience is with hardware
companies and not with software. ``I'll be drawing on my background
and experience of managing across lots of changing business
environments and business models,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining SGI less than two years ago, Belluzzo was a
leading light and potential CEO candidate at Hewlett-Packard, where
he worked for 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that caught much of the high-tech industry by
surprise, Belluzzo bailed out of SGI last week, just weeks after
announcing his latest plan to turn around the troubled maker of
computer workstations. Analysts said Belluzzo had become
increasingly frustrated in his efforts to nurse SGI back to health.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry watchers believe that Belluzzo will face a similar
uphill battle at Microsoft, whose Internet division has been rocked
recently by executive defections and increased competition from the
likes of American Online and Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft confirmed on Wednesday that Ben Silka, a
well-respected general manager in the Consumer and Commerce Group,
left the company to become director of information technology at
Amazon.com. Other departures this year include Steve Perlman, who
was president of WebTV, as well as Pete Higgins, who directed the
MSN community of Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, Microsoft badly trails AOL in terms of Internet
service subscribers and the number of visitors to its Web
properties. And earlier this week, Sun Microsystems struck another
blow against Microsoft when it announced that it had acquired
software-maker Star Division Inc., and would start offering word
processing and spreadsheet applications for free over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   This was interpreted by many as a direct attack on the Microsoft
Office software suite, which boasts 100 million customers and
accounts for roughly 40 percent of the company's total revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the threat from Sun, Ballmer said in the
conference call that Microsoft is working on its own ``Web-based
office productivity services, but we have no time table for that
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Parr, an analyst with International Data Corp., said
Microsoft appears to be moving away from Internet access and the
development of its own content and is concentrating more on
Internet software applications like instant messaging, e-mail and
electronic wallets.
</P>

 _ SF CHRON  
 EBay Pulls Human Kidney Off Internet Auction Site
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A human kidney was offered for sale on the Internet auction site
eBay, and the bidding went as high as $5.7 million before the
transaction was terminated yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from an eBay prohibition against sales of body parts, this
also happens to be a violation of federal law, punishable by five
years in prison or a $50,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't monitor every item that goes on the site,'' said
Robert Chesnut, eBay's associate general counsel. ``Over 300,000
items go up every day.''
</P>
<P>
   If eBay had not been alerted by a user that a kidney was for
sale on the site, Chesnut admitted that it is possible the deal
could have gone through. He noted, however, that the whole thing
could have been a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, seven separate bids were received for the kidney
between August 26, when the auction commenced, and yesterday
morning, when the plug was pulled.
</P>
<P>
   The seller was identified only as ``hchero'' from Sunrise, Fla.
The minimum bid requested was $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fully functional kidney for sale,'' the item description read.
``You can choose either kidney. Buyer pays all transplant and
medical costs. Of course only one for sale, as I need the other one
to live. Serious bids only.''
</P>
<P>
   EBay said it was in contact with Florida law enforcement
authorities about the case.
</P>
<P>
   Had the sale been completed, it might have been tough for the
buyer to simply show up at a hospital with the kidney. Dr. Wade
Smith, chairman of the ethics committee at the University of
California at San Francisco Medical Center, said a tacit rule
exists among transplant surgeons not to perform operations
involving dubiously obtained organs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the United States, we do not allow monetary gain from an
organ donation,'' he said. ``The system is well-designed to prevent
something like this from happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Von Roebuck, a spokesman for the California Transplant Donor
Network, agreed it would be virtually impossible for a kidney
transplant to occur in the United States outside established
channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a transplant to go through, a series of things need to
happen,'' he said. ``There's too much of a process that must take
place for something like that to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Roebuck acknowledged it is possible that the buyer of an
Internet-auctioned kidney might find a willing transplant surgeon
outside the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seller sounds like someone who knows there's a donor
shortage in this country and is taking advantage of the market,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from body parts, sales of all illegal goods are prohibited
by eBay. It is against the site's rules, for example, to offer a
nuclear bomb to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   But because users can list items without any screening, all
sorts of stuff ends up hitting the auction block alongside all
those Beanie Babies and Pez dispensers.
</P>
<P>
   To list an item on eBay, all a seller has to do is submit an
online form containing contact information, fill in the blanks for
the item's description and minimum bid sought, and pay a marginal
fee of no more than $2. The listing does not go through human hands
before finding its way to the Net.
</P>
<P>
   EBay has approximately 6 million regular users and has more than
2.6 million items up for auction.
</P>
<P>
   With such volume, the site relies on a ``community watch''
program whereby regular users police the various categories and
report any untoward activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We end hundreds of auctions every day,'' Chesnut admitted.
``It's not unusual for us to end 500 auctions in a day.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it would have been ``extraordinarily unlikely'' that
bidding on a human kidney would have closed without anyone spotting
it _ even though the kidney apparently was up for grabs for almost
an entire week before being pulled from the site.
</P>
<P>
   As of yesterday afternoon, the only kidney-related items for
sale included a steak and kidney pie ($20) and a 12-string
kidney-shaped guitar ($71).
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a teenager turned up on eBay auctioning off his
virginity to the highest bidder, but the transaction turned out to
be a prank.
</P>
<P>
   In April, a group of techies placed themselves up for sale for
$3.14 million _ which just happens to be the first three digits of
pi _ but withdrew the offer before bidding ended.
</P>
<P>
   Chesnut said there was no record of ``hchero'' offering any
other items for sale at eBay, and he did not know whether the
kidney seller had received a warning from the site about dealing in
prohibited goods.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat offenders will be suspended from the site, Chesnut said.

MICROSOFT NAMES NEW LEADERS FOR TROUBLED NET BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Searching for a way to revive its beleaguered Internet business,
Microsoft Corp. named a new leadership team for its online group
yesterday and indicated that it would emphasize its technology
underpinnings and continue to move away from a media strategy.
</P>
<P>
   As anticipated, the company named Richard Belluzzo, a longtime
Silicon Valley hardware executive, as the new head of its Consumer
and Commerce Group. Belluzzo, who resigned in August as chairman
and chief executive of Silicon Graphics Inc. after a failed
turnaround effort at that struggling work station company, will
report directly to Microsoft president Steven Ballmer as group vice
president for the company's Internet business.
</P>
<P>
   The two longtime employees who have been leading the group, Brad
Chase and Jon DeVaan, have been promoted to the position of senior
vice president, Ballmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer declined to give significant details about the company's
strategy for catching America Online, the dominant Internet service
provider, and AT&AMP;T, whose Internet business, Worldnet, is also
larger than Microsoft's service, MSN. But he did give several hints
about the direction the company would take.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to focus on fewer things and do those things
well,'' he said. ``We're going to be unabashed about technology.
We're not a media company although we will develop media style
skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Ballmer had been focusing on technology and on
controlling expenses to rein in the division's losses, estimated at
$500 million to $700 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really struck me today is when Steve said Microsoft was
going to rely on its strength as a technology company,'' said David
Readerman, a managing director at Thomas Weisel &AMP; Partners, a San
Francisco investment firm. ``The decision to bring Belluzzo was the
defining element in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part Belluzzo, who helped build Hewlett-Packard's laser
printer business as a longtime executive there, said he would rely
on his strengths in consumer businesses and his ability to master
the Internet's ``changing business models.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions, Ballmer appeared to step toward
closing the door on issuing a so-called tracking stock that would
reflect the value of the company's Internet business, saying that
although a final decision had not been made, there were no such
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer also acknowledged that a string of security flaws that
have plagued Microsoft in recent months _ including an episode this
week in which instructions were spread on the Internet for breaking
into accounts on its free e-mail service, Hotmail _ had hurt the
company's Internet brand. ``It's never good when your products fail
to to do what consumers want,'' he said.

 PUC Presses On With PG&AMP;E Probe
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Kenneth Howe &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
In the latest round of a regulatory power struggle, the California
Public Utilities Commission yesterday voted to continue its
investigation of last year's Pacific Gas and Electric power outage
that cut electricity to a million people, mostly in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, under political pressure, the PUC began to
consider a move to shut down its probe, leaving any further action
to the recently formed Independent System Operator.
</P>
<P>
   Since electricity deregulation reached the state last year, the
ISO, based in Folsom (Sacramento County), has been the state's
electric grid operator.
</P>
<P>
   In April, The ISO completed its own investigation and fined PG&AMP;E
$440,000 for the debilitating blackout, an amount consumer groups
characterized at the time as ``paltry.''
</P>
<P>
   In its decision yesterday, the PUC said it had ``the authority
and the obligation to investigate the outage'' but would
collaborate with the ISO. The PUC said it would hold hearings on
the matter beginning November 23. The seven-hour power outage in
December cost the local economy an estimated $400 million in
damages, according to a report commissioned by the PUC.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups and some local politicians, notably San
Francisco City Attorney Louise Renne, had urged the PUC to continue
its probe and not delegate its public-protection duties to the
semiprivate ISO.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, PG&AMP;E professed to be satisfied with the decision.
``It the PUC wants to collaborate with the ISO, that's fine,'' said
a company spokesman. ``We just don't want to be a political
football between these two agencies. We are working to make sure
customers receive energy safely and reliably.''

SPORTS COLUMN: SELES FEELS WINDY BLAST FROM PAST
</HEADLINE>
   (With TEN-USOPEN, TEN-USOPEN-AGASSI) 
(rk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Somewhere along the line, she lost the Woody
Woodpecker giggle that punctuated her thoughts both profound and
trivial. She is a grown-up.
</P>
<P>
   After six years of torment, Monica Seles is at peace with just
about everything but the little cyclones whirling around Arthur
Ashe Stadium _ at least when she is playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``One side, you're just so much wind to wind,'' Seles said
Thursday. ``The other side, you're so into the wind. I've never
played on a single court in my life that has this much wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Seles made her comments after beating Silvia Farina of Italy,
6-2, 6-3, in the second round of the U.S. Open. She is quite
content to play in the wake of Hingis and Davenport and the
assorted Williamses, but she just does not like playing in her own
personal nor'easter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really weird,'' Seles said ``If you open the doors down
where the level is'' _ meaning courtside _ ``then there's no wind.
But if the doors are closed, the wind just gets stuck, and it's
terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   She knows what is truly terrible. She was stabbed in the back on
a court in 1993. Her father, who was her coach and her friend, died
in the spring of 1998. And this spring she watched on television as
NATO bombs destroyed the Danube bridges she crossed in her
childhood in Novi Sad in northern Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The wind is not so terrible.
</P>
<P>
   There is a history to the swirling gusts just south of Flushing
Bay. When the Jets played football in Shea Stadium, a quarterback's
bullet passes swerved like Phil Niekro's knuckleball. Visiting
teams shrugged and ran the ball on their annual visit to the cave
of the winds, but Richard Todd had to play half his season there.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible the same wayward winds have been trapped in the
towering new tennis stadium?
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a bowl effect,'' Jay Snyder, the tournament
director, said Thursday. ``The wind gets in at the top and it moves
downward. Sometimes the direction at the bottom is totally
different from the way the flags are blowing.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Snyder said, he had not heard any complaints about the
wind _ although, as part of his job he does hear complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you feel you're in a hurricane,'' he admitted.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, Snyder said he would look into the effect of
opening or shutting the four doors at court level. Seles was hardly
making a federal case out of it. She was just happy to have
something so mundane to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I enjoy it more than a year ago,'' Seles said,
``because probably the last four weeks of this summer, for the
first time in my life, I really have no outside problems. And it's
been really nice. If I can just have this for the next two years,
I'd be really happy.''
</P>
<P>
   She can look ahead to at least two more years of tennis, even
though her father is not there to guide her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly miss him at the tennis court and at my practices,''
Seles said. ``It's just really hard to find direction, where my
tennis game should be leading, where my dad would lead me.''
</P>
<P>
   She gave credit to Jimmy Arias, who is coaching her here but
will be going back on the over-35 circuit. She travels with her
brother, Zoltan, and a male hitting partner, and she insisted: ``I
really never enjoyed playing matches, even as a youngster. I just
love to practice and drill and that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Why doesn't she enjoy matches?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hate the whole thought that one is better than the
other,'' Seles said. ``It drives me nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not correlate with the smiling-shark persona Seles
exuded when she was not wounded or in mourning. She always seemed
quite delighted at putting opponents away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe as a child, that's how I was brought up,'' she
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Does she lack a killer instinct?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no,'' Seles said. ``It's survival out there. If I
don't, then the other person will, so you go into that automatic
mode. You have no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Seles was asked if she was too nice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sometimes am,'' she said, laughing for one of the few times.
``I've been working on that.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she has learned to say no to people making demands on
her time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just part of growing up, I think,'' she said. ``Not be such a
pleaser.''
</P>
<P>
   The language and the poise suggested a woman who has come
through fire and rain. What can a little wind do to her?

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The voice in the crowd _ what was left of it, anyway _ was as crisp
and sharp as one of the New York Mets' many hits in yet another
series lost against one of the National League's best teams.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You guys are going to get knocked out in the first round of
the playoffs again!'' the fan yelled during the late innings of the
Astros' 17-1 loss on Monday. ``That's if you even make the
playoffs!''
</P>
<P>
   While Joe Fan may prove to be psychic in the coming weeks, it
doesn't take a crystal ball to see the reality of the Astros'
season.
</P>
<P>
   It's right there in bold print in newspapers across the country.
Flip to the baseball page, focus on the NL Central Division
standings, and notice where the Astros are _ and where they have
been for most of the season.
</P>
<P>
   It is indeed lonely at the top, and that's exactly where the
Astros have been for 126 of the 149 days of the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   But on the heels of last year's franchise-record 102 victories
and expectations that 1999 might be even better, somehow the
Astros' 95-win pace hasn't been enough to get all of the fans'
attention. Perhaps Houston sports fans spoil quicker than milk.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' roster is among the most injury-ravaged in baseball.
The Astros have used the disabled list 16 times, which explains the
majority of their 28 roster transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Quite frankly, the Astros aren't interested in using injuries as
an excuse, and with a .585 winning percentage, who needs excuses?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't get to where you want to get, you might say, What
if this or what if that?'' said center fielder Carl Everett, who
missed 20 games with an injury earlier this year and currently is
nursing a sore groin. ``But if you live by hypotheticals, you're
not going to get far. You have to live for what is, and that's what
we're doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can say what they want, but the other teams (in the NL
Central) have been chasing us all year. I could see if we were down
and trying to climb back up, but everyone is chasing us. We just
have to keep playing good baseball from here on out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros left Thursday for a seven-game trip to Montreal and
Philadelphia. When they take the field against the Expos tonight,
they will have a 1{-game lead over the Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   But you wonder if there would be much of a race if the Astros
had not played part _ or all _ of the season without Moises Alou,
Ken Caminiti, Ricky Gutierrez, Richard Hidalgo, Derek Bell and
Everett, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one said this was going to be easy,'' Caminiti said.
``We've gone through a lot this year, but we've battled and we're
still in first place. We're going through a little bit of a rough
time right now, but we just have to get out of it, and we will.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros have lost 12 of their last 22 games, including seven
of nine against the only decent teams _ the Braves and Mets _ they
have played during that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed in the way we're playing,'' manager Larry
Dierker said. ``But I have to be realistic. We don't have our whole
team. At the same time, we have just a few days left to win another
division title, and we're not going to do it if we don't start
playing better. On the other side of the coin, we could be losing
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Astros were losing four of six to the Mets over the
past 10 days, the Reds dropped five of six to the Braves _ so the
Astros actually gained a game in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of things to overcome and deal with this
season,'' second baseman Craig Biggio said. ``It's been a total
team effort, and we're where we are because of that. We still have
long way to go, but some of the younger guys we've had to play are
getting more experience and more confidence every day, and that's
good to see.''
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting to note that in its four years of existence,
the NL Central has been won by teams averaging 90 wins. The Astros
could lose 16 of their last 27 games and still finish with 90
victories. Of course, the Reds would have to go into a tailspin,
too, for 90 victories to win the Central in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great group of players, and if we don't win it, the
excuse is going to be that we don't have a full team,'' Everett
said. ``But to me, you can't make any excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of little things are what has caused us to lose a lot of
games, and if you ask me, those things could be avoided. I'm
pleased with the season and the players. We've given everything we
can. I give no excuses. Everyone has picked everyone up.''
</P>
<P>
   And if they can continue to do so for the next 27 games, a third
consecutive division title is within the grasp of the Astros _
regardless of all the injuries and adversity that have defined the
1999 season.

DON'T CODDLE FARMERS. BUY THEM OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Sept. 5) 
(jt) 
 By DANIEL AKST    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I live in a rural part of the Hudson Valley, where the weather
this summer has made me think I'm back in Southern California, my
previous home. Until some modest recent rains, the drought had
produced a landscape of lion-colored meadows and hillsides
reminiscent of the Santa Ynez Valley, near Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   The local farmers think this is bad news, and the federal
government has declared it a disaster, making farmers in designated
areas eligible for low-cost loans to help them through their
drought losses. The trouble, Jim Czub, a farmer in Schaghticoke,
N.Y., told Reuters, is that ``not only are we in drought, but those
of us who do have something, it isn't worth anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Far be it from me to take from the pockets of hard-working
neighbors, but shouldn't the drought be seen as a boon that the
government has no business mitigating? Normal rainfall, after all,
would mean even more overproduction of farm commodities, leading to
even lower prices and presumably more troubles for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The drought bailout, in fact, threatens to make things worse by
paying some farmers to produce just as Uncle Sam is contemplating
paying others not to. Last month, the Republican-controlled Senate
put aside its budgetary scruples to adopt a staggering $7.4 billion
farm aid package in response to low farm prices, after rejecting an
$11 billion Democratic alternative.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, neither party seems interested in alienating farmers
anywhere. And with Hillary Rodham Clinton the likely Democratic
candidate for Senator from New York, it shouldn't be surprising
that the executive branch has not chosen this time and place to
deviate from the government's record of irrational agricultural
interventions. So it's more of the same, even though the
never-ending need of American farmers, the world's most productive,
for federal help arises not from drought or global markets, but
from the bailouts, tax breaks and legal cartels that have come
before.
</P>
<P>
   But why just farmers? How can our leaders stand by as umbrella
manufacturers and raincoat companies, to cite just two examples,
struggle to stay afloat during the drought? Has anyone in
Washington tried selling aluminum gutters in this weather?
</P>
<P>
   And what about other kinds of droughts? For years, Americans
have watched TV instead of reading. How about low-interest loans
for writers afflicted by the drought of literacy? Things are so
tough that I've considered putting some of my 4.2 acres into
agricultural production. Not in hopes of selling produce, of course
_ just long enough for the Department of Agriculture to pay me to
take it back out again. Or could I just skip this step and go right
to the drought aid?
</P>
<P>
   But let's be realistic. Agricultural interests have too much
clout not to get tons of government money. Still, there may be a
better way to give it. Instead of paying drought aid or crop
support, why not just offer to buy out farmers altogether?
</P>
<P>
   Such a program would accomplish several goals, however dubious,
that everyone seems to favor. For one thing, it would help farmers
raise prices by taking land out of production. (If, like most
Americans, you buy food instead of growing it, tough luck.)
</P>
<P>
   But the plan would also be good for farmers' psyches, since it
could wean them from the seemingly bottomless public trough at
which agriculture has been feeding these many years. As a bonus, we
could reduce suburban sprawl by putting the former farmland into a
perpetual conservation trust. Communities could tap it to create
parks or wildlife preserves, or even community gardens _ as long as
the gardeners didn't dare try selling what they grew.
</P>
<P>
   Too expensive, you say? Hardly, given what we already spend to
make the problem worse. In one 10-year period, from 1986 to 1995,
federal farm policy cost taxpayers and consumers $370 billion,
enough to buy every farm in 41 states, according to James Bovard, a
critic of the policy who wrote the 1989 book ``Farm Fiasco.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, buying farms outright would save money. We could
even pay farmers over something like 20 years, the way we pay
lottery winners once they've read the fine print. Both would still
consider themselves lucky.
</P>

<P>
   PUPYONG, South Korea _ Transported by the whispers of workers
and housewives, a sense of impending doom is descending on this
auto factory town, whose fortunes have always marched in lockstep
with those of Daewoo Corp.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, the headlines have been filled with worrisome, if
hard-to-comprehend, reports of a showdown pitting heavily indebted
Daewoo, the nation's second-largest industrial conglomerate,
against the government and the company's many creditors. Finally,
last week came news so blunt that no one could mistake its meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day before yesterday was payday, but for the first time we've
ever seen, no salaries were paid,'' said a young mother of three,
who lives in this company town, an hour's drive northwest of Seoul,
in a vast thicket of Daewoo-owned high-rise apartments a stone's
throw from the car factory where her husband has worked for seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there are rumors that no bonuses will be paid,'' she said,
asking not to be identified. ``What can I say except that this is a
very difficult time for everyone here. We are all afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Struggling to meet the payments on its $47 billion in debt _
more than the entire national debt of Poland or Malaysia _ Daewoo
was dismembered through a government-brokered plan in August. As
the woman here spoke quietly, the company was being ordered to
comply with a government-designed debt repayment program that
effectively stripped it of control over its own finances.
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the moment he came to power in elections in 1997,
President Kim Dae-jung has been waging a battle to restructure the
giant, octopus-like conglomerates that in a single generation had
helped transform a poor country into the world's 11th-largest
economy, only to thrust South Korea into a major debt crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Daewoo's effective demise, and similar restructuring
plans being forced upon its sister conglomerates _ globally
familiar names like Hyundai, the largest, Samsung, LG and SK _ many
Korean and foreign investors have begun to say that the twilight of
the nation's conglomerates, or chaebol, is finally becoming a
reality.
</P>
<P>
   The changes introduced by Kim's government include the breakup
of these huge enterprises into a collection of much smaller units
that must be run for the first time as totally separate companies.
</P>
<P>
   This means the ending of cross subsidization of weak industries
by strong ones, and of a pattern of borrowing in which companies
within the chaebol that have healthy balance sheets obtain capital
for others in the red.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, it means an eventual end to the days
when the country's industrial chairmen wielded total, and often
totally secret, decision-making power over their sprawling empires,
even though they controlled as little as 5 percent of the stock.
</P>
<P>
   The government has ordered all industrial companies to take on
outside directors, gradually building to majorities of their
corporate boards. The new measures also prohibit companies from
sharing executives or directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has been walking a very fine line,'' said Chung
In-moon, a political scientist at Yonsei University. ``Pushing too
hard on the chaebol could severely damage the Korean economy, while
not pushing hard enough would mean losing a historic opportunity
for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has already scored one huge victory in this struggle,
limiting the power of the chairmen as it never has been before,''
he added. ``This represents a brave new world for Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   While some of the country's chaebol, notably Daewoo, are widely
seen as resisting the changes sweeping over the economy, others
appear to be moving quickly to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to reform these enterprises,'' said Park Se-yong,
chairman of Hyundai. ``Not only because of the reasons the
government has asked us to do so, but because these changes will
serve as the basis for us being better competitors. Even the
chaebol have to live up to the principle of being willing to
change.''
</P>
<P>
   These huge conglomerates have been central to South Korea's
nearly ballistic economic ascent _ and to its recent crisis. Their
sheer scale is breathtaking. In terms of their impact within the
country, the largest could be likened to the product of an
imaginary merger between General Motors and General Electric, with
steel, computer chip and shipmaking thrown in for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   But as South Korea's economy took off, becoming an exporter of
cars and consumer electronics, steel and supertankers, this breadth
concealed a glaring lack of depth. Korean products tended to mimic
their competitors' rather than be innovative. Other problems ranged
from poorly established brand names to a reputation for stodgy
design and spotty quality that caused some to derisively refer to
the country as the ``land of almost right.''
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, though, the conglomerates' growth was made
possible only through heavy protectionism and continuous borrowing.
This necessitated a supportive, even pliant government and a
favorable international economic environment.
</P>
<P>
   What started out in the early 1970s as a system of force-fed
industrialization led by President Park Chung-hee ended up as a
system in which successive governments became virtual hostages of
huge, debt-laden conglomerates. Korean officials gave birth to the
accumulation of debt: A small number of entrepreneurs were
virtually ordered to start export industries and were given
government-guaranteed and heavily subsidized loans to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their overwhelming importance to the economy and to
employment, these enterprises, it was felt, could not be allowed to
fail. The story of Daewoo, founded by Kim Woo-choong in 1967 with a
$10,000 family loan is, in this regard, typical.
</P>
<P>
   Within eight years, the company had gone from being a small
textile-trading business to an industrial conglomerate with 35,000
employees. It would soon boast the world's largest shipyard, and
earlier this year counted 100,000 employees and $80 billion in
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo's dizzying rise mirrored the seemingly miraculous quality
of South Korea's ride up the economic ladder. In the late 1960s,
the country was still emerging from the devastation of the war with
North Korea from 1950 to 1953.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to imagine the extent to which almost nothing
existed here when I first came,'' said Peter Bartholemew, an
American shipbuilder who has worked in South Korea for over 30
years. ``There were a little bit of textiles here, but basically
Korea had no manufacturing. There were no banks, no real
businessmen and very few people who spoke any foreign languages,
except Japanese, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost totally dependent upon aid from the United States, the
Korean economy received an unexpected boost from the Vietnam War,
which sprouted a number of industries that supplied the U.S.
military. The country's turn of luck and the easy money for
industry arranged by the government created a habit of success, and
though it would take years for it to show, bred hubris as well.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Daewoo, one of South Korea's spectacular success
stories, also proved to be perhaps the most spectacularly egregious
case of failure. In the midst of the Asian financial crisis of
1997, even as managing its own huge debt was becoming nearly
impossible, the conglomerate pressed ahead with expansion plans,
opening an opening an expensive new automobile factory in Vietnam
and buying a troubled Korean car maker, Ssangyong Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big ship never sinks,'' Kim, Daewoo's chairman, declared
last year. Early this year, however, he found himself unable to
meet the payments of the creditors, who responded to the company's
ballooning debt by imposing shorter and shorter terms on their
loans.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Since then, although Kim has become famous for wriggling out of
difficult situations, he has been forced to submit to a government
program that will leave him with six auto-related companies of the
conglomerate's more than 30 original affiliates. Even Daewoo
Motors, long his crown jewel, desperately needs a foreign partner
with deep pockets for it to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in this country say that Daewoo's founder, who
declined a request for an interview, felt that the government was
bluffing and would come to the conglomerate's rescue in its
struggle with its creditors to keep it from failing. According to
this line of thinking, a default would cripple the economy by
destroying South Korea's image of creditworthiness, and the
collapse of Daewoo would create domestic unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, Kim again signaled his government's
unwillingness to cover the company's overseas debts, throwing his
weight behind a complicated debt workout plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, there was a myth here that some companies were
too big to fail,'' said Hak Kuh-joh, a senior economic adviser to
the president. ``This myth is being shattered, and soon everyone
will recognize it.''
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's workers, who were indoctrinated for decades to
regard their corporate employers as their large extended family,
watched bitterly last year as the crisis everyone here calls simply
IMF, after the International Monetary Fund, seemed to strike
everyone hard except for the leaders of the country's
conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even though many sense the end of an era when the country's
industries were growing by leaps and bounds and stores filled
almost exclusively with Korean brands fed national pride, few are
shedding tears for the conglomerate's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This crisis came about as a result of the monopolization of
information and of decision-making power, and for allowing that, we
have no one to blame but ourselves,'' said Han Ae-tack, 35, a car
plant worker and union official who showed a visitor around
Daewoo's gigantic housing project in Pupyong. ``Now the foreigners
with lots of capital are salivating as they prepare to swallow us
up.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than two weeks after the Federal Reserve raised its federal
funds target rate by a quarter percentage point, high-quality
municipal bonds are looking extraordinarily attractive relative to
plain-vanilla Treasury bonds, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, for example, New York's Triborough Bridge and
Tunnel Authority priced $225 million of highly rated, general
purpose revenue bonds due in 2030 to yield 5.74 percent, or 94
percent of the 6.08 percent yield on a 30-year Treasury bond. So an
investor would give up only a smidgen of yield in return for munis'
freedom from taxation. And while that 94 percent figure is less
than the 100 percent ratio that munis hit briefly last fall, it is
still far above the 85 percent that they have averaged since the
Tax Reform Act of 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absurd,'' said David Kotok, president of Cumberland
Advisors, a muni bond manager in Vineland, N.J. ``Tax-free yields
are nearly equal to those on taxable instruments.'' He noted that
for a taxpayer with a combined state and federal tax rate of 45
percent, a muni with a 5.8 percent coupon has a tax-equivalent
yield of 9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of factors are at play here. The amount of Treasury
bonds outstanding has been tapering off and is expected to shrink
by $100 billion this year, making them relatively more expensive,
compared with most other kinds of debt, according to R.B. Davidson
3rd, director of municipal investments at Sanford C. Bernstein. A
result, he said, is that ``individuals in high tax brackets should
move out of Treasuries and into high-grade munis.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the robust U.S. economy has vastly improved the credit
quality of most municipal bond jurisdictions, so default risk for
high-quality munis is virtually zero, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   But because of rising supply, the increased credit quality has
not come at the expense of higher muni prices. Taking advantage of
interest-rate cuts last year, muni bond issuance rose sharply as
governments sought to cut borrowing costs.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, demand for munis by institutions has all but
evaporated. ``No money has gone into muni bond funds since April,''
said George Friedlander, fixed-income strategist with Salomon Smith
Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the biggest factor weighing down muni prices is the
protracted, take-no-prisoners bull market in stocks, said
Christopher Dillion, an analyst with J.P. Morgan Securities.
Against annual double-digit gains in the stock market, 5 percent
yields on munis look puny. Because muni bonds are not subject to
the ebb and flow of foreign demand, they have been far more stable
investments than Treasuries, said Steven Harrop, a manager with
Strong Capital Management. Kotok added that investors in an index
of muni bonds at about this time last year would have ridden out
the turmoil in global financial markets without experiencing much
volatility. He calculated that over the last 115 weeks, 10-year
Treasuries were three times as volatile as munis, as measured by
their standard deviation.
</P>
<P>
   Those interested only in income might do best to buy individual
bonds and hold them to maturity, instead of buying muni bond funds.
The strategy allows investors to tailor bond cash flows and
maturations to their particular needs.
</P>
<P>
   But if you think muni prices will rise and you want to take
advantage of the gain, a fund or managed account might make sense.
Kotok said current prices offered the chance for capital gains of
15 percent or more if, as he expects, muni prices rise enough to
push their yields down to 85 percent of that of Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Shamosh, fixed-income strategist at Tucker Anthony Inc.,
said that with rates at their current levels, buying munis yourself
makes more sense. ``In a 5 percent rate environment, management
fees may outweigh the advantages of management expertise,
purchasing efficiency and diversification,'' he said.

CHALLENGES FOR BOEING AFTER UNION APPROVES PACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boeing Co.'s largest union voted overwhelmingly Wednesday night
to accept a three-year contract, averting a strike that would have
dealt a blow to Boeing's efforts to recover from a financial
downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Of the votes cast by members of the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents 44,300 of
Boeing's 207,000 employees, 86 percent, or 26,842, were for the
contract. A simple majority was required for passage.
</P>
<P>
   Both the union and the company hailed the results, which headed
off what would have been the third walkout by the machinists in the
last 10 years. ``With this contract, the company and the union must
move forward together to capture productivity gains and
significantly improve the company's financial performance and
growth,'' said Peter Conte, a Boeing spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   That Boeing still faces large challenges was made evident
Thursday, when it announced that it was taking a $225 million
charge in the third quarter after losing crucial campaigns to sell
F-15 jet fighters to Greece and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Boeing announced a $45 million charge and
layoffs of 7,000 workers in St. Louis after Greece chose the F-16
made by Lockheed Martin Corp. over the F-15. The company said that
the additional charge reflected money it had invested in parts for
24 fighters it hoped to sell to Israel, which also chose to buy the
F-16 instead.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing stated that ``there is a limited near-term market'' for
the F-15, though it hopes that the U.S. Air Force will order some
this year, keeping the production line active for possible future
sales.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The company also said that the latest charge and the new labor
contract, which the company and the union said would make the
machinists the best-paid workers in the aerospace industry, would
not affect the existing estimates of future profits.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were uncertain whether the charge, which amounts to 17
cents a share, meant that they should lower their earnings
estimates for this year, which average $2 a share, according to
First Call.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be that what Boeing is telling us is that somewhere
else in the company there is another $225 million that we didn't
tell you about,'' said Joseph F. Campbell, a managing director at
Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has exceeded Wall Street expectations in each of the last
two quarters. But those expectations are much diminished in the
wake of production turmoil that began two years ago at Boeing's
flagship passenger jet division. That has resulted in lackluster
profits for the company at a time when demand for its jets has been
at a record high.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing plans to deliver a record 620 commercial airplanes this
year but promises profit margins of just 5 percent on projected
revenue of $58 billion. Some analysts and investors think that
Boeing's chairman Philip Condit felt he had little choice but to
give the machinists what they wanted because a strike would have
disrupted the company's delicate financial recovery.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This is a company that has come off a two-year disaster and
doesn't want to upset Wall Street expectations,'' said Steve
Binder, an aerospace analyst at Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The new contract raises hourly wages for machinists nearly 16
percent over three years, to an average of $24.35 an hour. The
contract also raises retirement benefits 25 percent and contains a
one-time 10 percent bonus that amounts to an average of $4,400 a
worker.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Boeing abandoned an attempt to introduce weekend
shifts that would have reduced overtime payments, and it failed to
get the union to agree to have its members help shoulder the cost
of health insurance. The company also agreed not to lay off any
workers as a result of a decision to contract out some work to
other manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and investors were not too concerned about the
increased wages, a large portion of which will be passed on to
Boeing's airline customers in the form of escalation clauses in
their sales contracts. But they worried that by giving in to the
union on the issue of weekend work and subcontracting, Condit had
forsaken two important tools the company needed to increase its
efficiency as he has promised to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the surface this pact seems to limit Boeing's ability to
achieve large productivity gains,'' Binder said.
</P>
<P>
   The union, on the other hand, had exactly the opposite concerns.
While the leaders strongly endorsed the new contract, which Boeing
submitted early Saturday, they were disappointed that they did not
get more firm job guarantees from the company.
</P>
<P>
   An opposition faction within the union picked up on that theme
and campaigned against ratification, complaining that the
negotiators did not secure strong enough guarantees of job security
and did not win cost-of-living increases for retirees.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, most union members thought that the offer was
the best deal they were going to get without enduring a costly
walkout.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Viacom Inc. and CBS Corp. have held discussions in recent weeks
about a deal that could involve their television stations _
possibly in some type of merger _ several executives in the
entertainment industry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Like a number of companies with television-station holdings, CBS
and Viacom are seeking ways to benefit from a recent ruling by the
Federal Communications Commission that allows a company to own two
television stations in the same market under certain circumstances.
That ruling opens the way for cost savings and programming
flexibility not previously available to owners of television
stations.
</P>
<P>
   CBS has 15 television stations, with the acquisition of one more
pending. Viacom owns 19 stations. In five markets, both own a
station.: Dallas, Boston, Miami, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   A deal to merge all the stations would face an obstacle. If CBS,
for example, were to buy all Viacom's stations, the reach of its
outlets would exceed the FCC's limits. The agency allows a single
company to own stations that reach up to 35 percent of the U.S. TV
market; CBS is already nudging that limit.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom and CBS are not the only companies in discussions and
both may also be in talks with other companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you took the 10 leading media companies since the Federal
Communications Commission decision, everybody has talked to
everybody more than before because there is so much more
opportunity for deals,'' said one industry expert.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Viacom and CBS would not comment on the possibility
of a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Among other media companies, Barry Diller, the chairman of USA
Networks, has been reported to be in discussions with Walt Disney
Co.'s ABC network about a possible merger of television stations.
</P>
<P>
   But what makes the possibility of a deal between Viacom and CBS
particularly interesting, analysts say, is speculation that merger
talks have gone beyond simply the television station business to
include the two companies overall.
</P>
<P>
   Such a plot would have great appeal on Wall Street. The
companies could not only combine a number of their television
stations but their radio stations, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Both also have interests in music television: Viacom owns MTV,
and CBS owns Gaylord Broadcasting, which owns the Nashville
Network. And both are underleveraged, so that a merger would leave
them able to continue making other acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue, however, media executives said privately, was
management control. Some investors would favor the deal because
Sumner Redstone, who controls Viacom, is 76 years old and has no
heir apparent. A merger with CBS would assure that its chairman,
Mel Karmazin, would provide seasoned leadership into the future.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Redstone has shown no sign of slowing down,
and some executives who know Karmazin, himself a tough-minded
executive, cannot imagine that he would want to report to Redstone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could never live in the same house,'' said one Wall
Street executive who knows both men. Another said he felt that
Viacom was more likely to strike a deal that would leave Redstone
in clearer management control.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom's own situation is particularly complex since it has
begun the UPN Network together with Chris-Craft Industries, which
itself owns 10 television stations. For several years, analysts who
follow Chris-Craft have hoped that the chairman, Herbert Siegel,
would either sell it or enter a joint venture with another company.
But he has seemed unwilling to make a move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Siegel is being offered a high, inside pitch with bases loaded
because the new duopoly rules make his stations much more valuable,
and it is up to him to swing,'' said Mario Gabelli, chief
investment officer of Gabelli Asset Management, whose funds are
major shareholders in Chris-Craft.
</P>
<P>
   Chris-Craft also controls BHC Inc. and United Television Inc.,
both of which own television stations.

editing error, an article on Tuesday about a joint concert
performance by German and Israeli musicians at Buchenwald on Sunday
misattributed a 19th-century Romantic tradition exploited by the
Nazis. The passage in question should have read: ``This humanism

<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ When he seemed to have everything,
Pyotr Suspitsyn felt only loss.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Suspitsyn owned and ran a thriving import-export
business and several restaurants in St. Petersburg, and made plenty
of money. But none of it quenched the spreading emptiness inside
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, I realized life is so short and fragile that
you need to do something important,'' Suspitsyn said. ``It's not
about vacationing on the Canary Islands or buying an expensive
house to show off to your friends. I asked myself, `What's all this
for?' And I realized I was losing _ losing something every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the strain of work, Suspitsyn's marriage disintegrated.
That was the final push he needed to abandon his old life and begin
a new, riskier one: He sold control of his businesses and used the
proceeds to open a tiny publishing house called Rare Book of St.
Petersburg, which issues handmade books in very limited editions.
</P>
<P>
   The successful entrepreneur who drops out of big business to
pursue an arcane labor of love is a familiar type in the West, but
in Russia, Suspitsyn is as rare as his books. Most business people
here race to make as much as they can, any way they can, in case
Russian capitalism proves short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping out of this age of greed, Suspitsyn, 35, is working to
revive a tradition of making books so exquisite that each is a work
of art. Rare Book's editions of venerable texts are printed on
19th-century presses that he found and restored. An artist
illuminates each book, adding illustrations and ornamental
decoration to the pages by hand. Suspitsyn's Book of Psalms has a
walnut cover with a brass engraving of King David playing the lyre;
the palm-sized edition of Shakespeare's sonnets is bound in velvet;
his edition of ``Antigone'' in the original ancient Greek of
Sophocles is bound with ceramic covers showing the heroine's head
cracked like a dinner plate.
</P>
<P>
   His work has attracted esteem _ and purchase orders _ from
libraries and museums in several countries, including the New York
Public Library, and the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg has held
one exhibition of Suspitsyn's books and plans another.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when books were looked upon as something that
embodied a culture in terms of its art, its technology _ when the
best volumes were viewed as artifacts themselves,'' said Edward
Kasinec, librarian of the Slavic and Baltic collection at the New
York Public Library, explaining Suspitsyn's publishing venture. ``I
think that's what's driving him: this glorious, glorious
tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other needs behind it, too. The son of a naval
officer, Suspitsyn grew up around books and art and for a time
wanted to be an artist himself. Instead, he studied for service in
the merchant marine and dabbled in everything from boxing to the
Hare Krishna movement before going into business for himself when
Communism collapsed in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Suspitsyn still moves in the big-money world: he retained
minority stakes in his old companies and receives dividends, much
of which go to subsidize Rare Book, which has yet to turn a profit.
But in his printing studio, Suspitsyn has fashioned a refuge from
an increasingly bleak Russia. The studio occupies space in a
Baroque building, across a humpbacked bridge from the Hermitage
palace. No nameplate or sign announces its presence, only
Suspitsyn's silver Jaguar parked in front.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to create the atmosphere of a monastery here,''
Suspitsyn said in the studio's kitchen, darkened by the towels
drawn across its one window. ``My door is locked. The world stays
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon, Andrei Doktyev, a slender bookbinder with the
angular face of a Byzantine saint, leads visitors into the Rare
Book printing studio. The place has the air of a different era and
unusual devotions. Flat blocks of limestone lean against the
entranceway wall with etchings of square-jawed Soviet heroes on one
side; the backs of the stones bear the lithographic drawings used
to print some of Rare Book's volumes.
</P>
<P>
   In the studio, the light is golden, reflecting off a wall of
polished wooden drawer cases where 20 kinds of Latin and Cyrillic
type are stored. Printing machines crowd the 12- by 30-foot room;
across one end is a clothesline where each carefully imprinted page
is hung to dry.
</P>
<P>
   In the adjoining kitchen there is soldering equipment for making
covers of marble, wood and leather. The rooms are hushed. A Russian
blue cat named Pyotr Mikhailich rubs against the furniture.
</P>
<P>
   The six workers in the studio, including Suspitsyn, do
everything but the illumination work; for that, he contracts with
outside artists, 11 so far for the 19 titles that Rare Book has
issued. In fact, he generally chooses the artist first, then
selects the book to be published in consultation with the artist.
Print runs range from five to 30 copies and can take several years
from conception to completion; production is done in small batches
so that the artists do not tire of the work. Rare Book's most
ambitious project so far has been the Book of Psalms, in
painstaking progress for four years.
</P>
<P>
   Suspitsyn continues a tradition that had almost been lost,
according to Kasinec of the New York Public Library. Russia had a
rich bibliophilic movement that flowered at the turn of the century
and enjoyed a revival in the late 1960s and 1970s, when Soviet
publishing houses turned out gorgeous collectors' editions. But the
country's lurching transition to a market economy wiped out many of
those houses; others turned to producing inexpensive mass-market
romances and mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   Rare Book's offerings, which range in price from $1,000 to
$8,000, are far beyond the means of Russia's mostly cash-starved
libraries and museums; foreign institutions are among the few
customers Suspitsyn has. The New York library bought one copy of
``The Story of the Battle Between Life and Death,'' a prose
retelling of an unsigned 17th-century Russian epic.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Suspitsyn's previous business colleagues occasionally
buy his books, usually for expensive gifts. Suspitsyn said he has
little in common with them any more: They do not understand why he
chose to give up a thriving business for books that barely sell.
</P>
<P>
   They might find the answer in one of the first songs he chose
for his compilation of Psalms:
</P>
<P>
   ``Our God is in the heavens; he does whatever he pleases. Their
idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands. They have
mouths, but do not speak; eyes, but do not see.''
</P>
<P>
   Resting his hand on the warm wood of the book's cover, he
explained, ``I thought it would be a good beginning.''

 &HT;    Ohio univeristy to release names of students charged with
violent crimes
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The University of Dayton plans to start releasing
the names of students who commit rape, assault and other violent
crimes on campus.
</P>
<P>
   The new procedures, which began with the start of classes last
week, reverse a long-standing policy that had shielded the results
of cases brought before the UD internal disciplinary board.
Sanctions against the students also will be made public.
</P>
<P>
   University officials said an amendment to a federal law paved
the way for the new policy. The amendment allows universities to
release information from student disciplinary proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not it will have any deterrent effect, I don't
know,'' said William Schuerman, UD vice president of student
development and dean of students. ``But the more information you
can come forward with, the more confident the community is going to
feel.''
</P>
<P>
   In another departure from past policies, Schuerman said Dayton
police are now routinely involved in felony investigations on
campus. That could change somewhat, he said, as discussions
continue with the Montgomery County prosecutor's office and Dayton
police on how best to handle serious campus crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The policy changes at UD come seven months after a Dayton Daily
News story chronicled the school's confidential disciplinary
system, which frequently was used in place of the criminal courts.
Under the system, officials refused to reveal the names of student
offenders and the punishment they received.
</P>
<P>
   Event though the federal amendment to the student-privacy law
had been passed at the time, UD officials said the disciplinary
records were private ``contracts'' with their students and the
school refused to release the documents.
</P>
<P>
   Among the cases forwarded to the disciplinary board last year
(but not initially turned over to the Montgomery County
prosecutor's office) was an alleged rape by a former UD football
player. The outcome of the university hearing was kept secret. In
court, prosecutors sought criminal charges but a grand jury
declined to hand up an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   By being more open, UD hopes to show its students and the Dayton
community that the school is holding offenders responsible for
serious offenses, Schuerman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will certainly provide people with information, which I
think in this day and age, they want to know,'' he said. ``It
allows us to keep up with a new level of sensitivity'' about campus
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations such as the Pennsylvania-based Security On Campus
Inc. and the media, particularly student newspapers, have been
pushing to open student crime and disciplinary records for years.
Howard Clery of Security on Campus said it is important for
colleges and universities to be frank about campus crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't do any good to hide it,'' Clery said. ``You can't
work on a problem if you hide it.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Clery isn't certain how many U.S. colleges and
universities have adopted policies similar to Dayton's, he said
more of them have begun to do so. Miami University, for example,
implemented the same policy as UD on Aug. 15, university
spokeswoman Holly Wissing said.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State and Wright State do not release information from
disciplinary hearings, officials at those schools said.
</P>
<P>
   Schuerman said student names on UD police reports will continue
to remain confidential, unless arrests are made and the reports are
forwarded to the Dayton police department for possible prosecution.

CARPE DIEM, EVEN TO THE GRAVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Sept. 5)

<P>
   In the 1920s, when Calvin Coolidge declared, ``The business of
America is business,'' the expression ``24/7'' had yet to invade
the language. But as the following anecdotes illustrate, the nation
conducts business 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and no site is
spared, even the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   When she was a human resources manager, Terri Schaeffer of New
York City also wore the hat of recruiter. And since good help is
hard to find, she kept her eyes and ears open, even when supposedly
off duty.
</P>
<P>
   One day, while seated on her regular perch at a Burger Heaven
counter, she overheard a young woman talking about her job search.
The woman had recently arrived from the Midwest, had consulted
employment agencies and had been sent on all kinds of dull
interviews. So there, among the burgers and colas, Ms. Schaeffer
introduced herself and began interviewing the woman.
</P>
<P>
   After determining that she had the skills necessary for an
entry-level job, Ms. Schaeffer arranged an official interview, and
the woman received a job offer.
</P>
<P>
   But she turned it down. She had decided to accept another
position _ as a recruiter for an employment agency.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, before he retired, Allen Leboff of Great
Neck, N.Y., was a partner in a Long Island accounting firm. While
on vacation in Venice with his wife, Irma, he was telling her about
the difficulty the firm was having in finding good young
accountants.
</P>
<P>
   A couple seated behind the Leboffs on a canal boat were
listening, and Leboff was soon interrupted by the woman, who
apologized and said: ``I know you won't believe this, but we have a
son who is an accountant and is thinking of changing his job. Could
he call on you for an interview?''
</P>
<P>
   Leboff said he could, and gave the woman his business card.
``The young man did call me,'' he writes. ``I did interview him; my
firm did hire him, and he has become, and still is, a partner in my
firm.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, a bachelor's degree firmly in hand, Bix Janni of
Brooklyn, N.Y., faced two big obstacles to joining corporate
America: His degree was in English, and he was prime fodder to be
drafted for military service.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the few employees who hired draft-eligible men was the
federal government,'' he writes. ``Reluctantly, I accepted a
position an office auditor with the IRS.''
</P>
<P>
   One day, a Westchester County man who had requested a change of
venue after a grueling interview with a tax auditor near his home
landed in Janni's Brooklyn cubicle. The man ``kept telling me I was
in the wrong profession,'' Janni writes. After the audit, ``he
handed me his business card, telling me to contact him if I wanted
a job with his firm. I looked at the company's name, smiled and
told him the company's campus interviewer would not even see me
when he visited my college.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The man smiled and told me not to worry,'' Janni says.
</P>
<P>
   He got the job.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is a postscript. Nine months after joining the
company _ IBM _ as a systems engineer, he was drafted and sent to
Vietnam. PPS: After Vietnam, he nabbed a job in publishing and was
finally able to put his English degree to work.
</P>
<P>
   Lee van de Velde of Philadelphia, an executive search
consultant, is used to meeting people in busy, uncomfortable
places, like train stations and hotel lobbies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therefore, imagine my delight at meeting a promising candidate
on the chairlift to the top of Bromley Mountain in Vermont, with a
chill factor of minus 15,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   Because Ms. van de Velde discovered their potential mutual
interest only at the drop-off spot atop the mountain, she chased
the candidate down the slope on skis. As the woman prepared to ride
up again, Ms. van de Velde hopped in her chair. She considered but
rejected the idea of asking the woman to remove her goggles and
chin protector to see what she looked like _ presentability matters
in the workplace, after all _ and then wrote the contact
information on the lift ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, she eventually (after several non-goggled interviews) got
the job, and I got a good story,'' Ms. van de Velde writes.
</P>
<P>
   Business is often conducted in odd locations, but some sites are
odder than others.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was a gathering last fall at a cemetery to dedicate
the gravestone of Sara Nuss-Galles' mother-in-law, who had died a
year earlier, at 93.
</P>
<P>
   ``The small group attending included my husband Arie Galles'
childhood friend and her husband,'' an actor, says Ms. Nuss-Galles,
the writer of the magazine of Drew University in Madison, N.J. ``We
were touched at their presence.''
</P>
<P>
   As they returned to their cars, the actor handed Galles a
plastic folder. Inside were the actor's portfolio, head shots, news
releases, clippings and a detailed resume.
</P>
<P>
   It did not take Ms. Nuss-Galles long to guess where the actor
might hope the resume would land _ with her son, Jeremy Haft,
director of the 1997 movie ``Grizzly Mountain.''

<P>
   Saying the federal education bureaucracy is shortchanging poor
children, Gov. George W. Bush proposed on Thursday cutting funds
from low-performing programs and allowing some parents to use the
money to pay for private school.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, blasted by opponents as a federal voucher
program, was part of the most ambitious and detailed proposal Bush
has unveiled since he began running for president.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech in Los Angeles that focused on disadvantaged
children, Bush also called for more student testing, ``bonus''
funds to schools that improve and a sharper academic focus to the
pre-school program known as Head Start.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many years the federal government has tried to close the
gap of hope _ armed with good intentions and billions of dollars,''
Bush said. ``But sacks of money and the best of motives have made
little difference in the performance of disadvantaged children.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Bush's plan, disadvantaged children in schools that fail
achievement standards three straight years could take an estimated
$1,500 in federal Title I funds and spend it on tutoring, private
school, or ``whatever their parents choose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the best case, these schools will rise to the challenge and
regain the confidence of parents,'' Bush said. ``In the worst case,
we will offer scholarships to America's neediest children ... in
any case, the federal government will no longer pay schools to
cheat poor children.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said it is ``a scandal of the first order'' that the
average test scores of blacks and Hispanics at age 17 are equal to
those of Anglo 13-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say pigment and poverty need not determine performance,'' he
said. ``That myth is disproved by good schools every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he never said the word ``vouchers,'' that is exactly what
detractors are calling Bush's proposal on Title I money.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Chase, president of the anti-voucher National Education
Association, a teachers' union, said Bush's proposal is out of
touch with the American mainstream and would drain money away from
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush says he wants to invest in programs that work,
but he's willing to waste millions of tax dollars on vouchers,
which don't work,'' Chase said. ``For a fraction of the cost of a
voucher, we can put struggling students in smaller classes, where
all of them _ not just a select few _ will learn to read, write and
compute at higher levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also was hit from the right. The campaign of wealthy
magazine publisher Steve Forbes criticized the plan as ``too weak,
too narrow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If parents find their kids trapped in public schools, Governor
Bush makes them wait three more years before they might be set
free,'' said J. Kenneth Blackwell, national chairman of the Forbes
2000 campaign. ``We need to set Americans free immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Education Agency in Austin said Texas this year
received $662 million in Title I funding. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997-1998 school year, 1.8 million children in Texas were
involved in Title I program funding.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from allowing parents the option of taking their children
out of failing public schools, Bush would require that school
districts receiving Title I funds test children each year on the
academic basics.
</P>
<P>
   Under his initiative, schools that improve would get extra
funding, while federal programs that fail would be replaced by ones
that are proven successful.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would not require federal testing, instead leaving
it up to the states. It was one several instances in which Bush
walked a fine line between adhering to his principle of local
control while attempting to ensure federal oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not have a national school board, and we do not need
one,'' Bush said. ``A president is not a federal principal, and I
will not be one.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, in a July swing to Milwaukee that highlighted school
choice issues, Bush said he opposed ``federalization of education''
and said presidents should ``encourage local folks to develop
accountability measures,'' the Houston Chronicle reported.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also turned his sights on Thursday on the Head Start
program, started in 1965 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. The $4.6
billion annual program serves 842,000 poor children and families.
</P>
<P>
   Bush proposed moving Head Start out of the Health and Human
Services Department and putting it under the Department of
Education.
</P>
<P>
   He said Head Start has strayed from its origins as a literacy
program to ``a day-care, health and nutrition program.'' He cited
studies showing it has not consistently helped children prepare for
school.
</P>
<P>
   Health Department spokesman Michael Kharfen disputed Bush's
description, saying Head Start helps children ages 3 and 4 prepare
for school and calling its results ``outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he criticized the focus on nutrition and health, Bush
did not propose cutting those programs. In fact, he said the
reforms could be accomplished ``without sacrificing Head Start's
important social and medical services.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told by the Bush people I talked to that they didn't
intend to change the health and the services aspect, or even the
nurturing aspect,'' said E.D. Hirsch, a professor at the University
of Virginia who was consulted by the campaign about the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch said proposing to move the program to the Department of
Education was symbolic, but he applauded the effort to put the
focus on cognitive development. He said changes made last year
already have begun moving Head Start in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   On a political level, William Bennett, a conservative leader and
former education secretary, said Bush wisely stepped away from the
issue of shutting down the education department as some
conservatives want.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that Bush had borrowed some of his ideas _
particular on vouchers _ from his brother Jeb, the Florida
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smart thing in this is, you put your opponents in favor of
keeping kids in failing schools,'' Bennett said.

WHISTLE-BLOWER PROSECUTOR ONCE ACCUSED OF COVERUP IN WACO
INVESTIGATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By GABRIELLE CRIST 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ The assistant U.S. attorney who has accused the
government of covering up the use of pyrotechnic devices at the
1993 Branch Davidian siege near Waco was once himself accused of
covering up other evidence in the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Bill Johnston announced that someone in the
Justice Department faxed him a document establishing that
pyrotechnic tear gas canisters were used on the last day of the
standoff, which ended when the compound burned to the groud. Cult
leader David Koresh and about 80 of his followers were found dead
inside.
</P>
<P>
   For six years, Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI officials
have adamantly denied the use of the pyrotechnic canisters. But
last week, they confirmed that two, possibly three, of the
canisters were launched hours before the fire erupted and away from
the main wooden compound.
</P>
<P>
   The document, a three-page memo prepared by a paralegal, has
some handwritten notes on it with words to the effect of ``Do not
disclose,'' Johnston said. No explanation accompanied the fax,
Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston went public with the memo, he said, so the truth about
the Waco siege can finally come out. But four years ago, it was
Johnston who was accused of covering up information about some of
the events surrounding the deadly standoff.
</P>
<P>
   During his 1995 congressional hearing testimony, Fort Worth
defense attorney Tim Evans presented an internal ATF memo saying
that Johnston told ATF agents to stop their internal investigation
of the shooting that started the 51-day seige and left two
Davadians and four ATF agents dead.
</P>
<P>
   The memo said Johnston was fearful that it would create evidence
defense attorneys could use at the upcoming criminal trials for
some of the Branch Davidian survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston allowed ATF agents to interview one other agent, but
``no notes were created,'' the memo says.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Thursday, Evans said the documents ``speak
for themselves and they speak pretty plain language.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Texas law, defense attorneys should have been given the
information before the 1994 trials, or at least during them, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law requires the government to reveal this information
...'' Evans said. ``Any agent that knew it and any prosecutor that
knew it should have disclosed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said he understands that it looks somewhat hypocritical
for him to be accused of cover-up then accuse someone else, but
``this is an issue I dealt with fully at Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking for any breaks from anyone,'' Johnston said.
``This is fair game to bring up, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   As he said in his testimony then, Johnston explained that he
stopped the ATF shooting review because it was going to duplicate
the independent investigation he had asked the Texas Rangers to
conduct. Because of the controversy surrounding the shooting,
Johnston said, he did not think the ATF should investigate the
matter internally.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the attorneys who defended clients at the criminal
trials criticized Johnston for his previous actions, but commended
him for his recent turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I think Bill Johnston made some mistakes in the past?
Absolutely,'' said Houston attorney Dan Cogdell, who represented a
Branch Davidian who was acquitted. Nevertheless, Cogdell said he is
pleased to know that Johnston has ``recognized that the truth is
bigger than him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's realized the errors of his ways,'' said Houston
defense attorney Dick DeGuerin. ``I'm glad he's seen the light.''

   GOLCUK, Turkey _ When summer began, Remzi Tarhan might have been
the happiest man in this sun-drenched town. Seventeen years after
moving here from his native village on the Black Sea coast, he had
finally realized his dream of opening a restaurant specializing in
anchovy casserole and other Black Sea delicacies.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant, and with it Tarhan's hopes for the future,
collapsed into ruins when Golcuk was struck by a shattering
earthquake Aug. 17 that left at least 14,500 people dead. Now he
wants to pack up his family and move back to the underdeveloped
eastern part of Turkey from which he came.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we stay here, we'll be struggling with chaos for years,''
he said as he stared out across acres of rubble. ``I don't want my
kids to grow up in that kind of climate. I started from zero when I
came here, and I'm ready to do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Golcuk and other towns that were devastated by the quake lie in
the heart of Turkey's booming industrial region. For a generation,
this area has drawn ambitious Turks from eastern provinces who come
in search of jobs and opportunity. But in a development that may
have profound social and political effects, many of those who came
here to build new lives are now saying they want to go back home.
</P>
<P>
   In this reverse migration, thousands of people who have lived in
prosperous parts of Turkey are likely to return to poorer regions.
Many will bring urban attitudes with them, along with a new-found
cynicism about their political system stemming from the
government's failures in the earthquake relief effort.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the disaster area said this week that since the
earthquake, more than 30,000 residents of the quake zone have moved
away after notifying the local authorities of their plans. At least
that many more, they estimated, have left without bothering to
comply with legal formalities.
</P>
<P>
   If enough of these people fan out through rural Turkey, they may
emerge as a new force for social and political change. Their
influence could accelerate the modernization of the country's less
developed regions, and also reshape political attitudes there as
they return with considerably less deference toward the government.
</P>
<P>
   Towns struck by the quake were not only booming economically
before the disaster but were also social melting pots where
well-to-do vacationers and business managers mixed with migrants
from backward regions. And they lie just a ferry ride away from
Istanbul, one of the world's most cosmopolitan cities and a hotbed
of social and political ferment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot like the immigrants who left Turkey to go to
Germany,'' said Ahmet Altan, a newspaper columnist and social
critic. ``They came back with new ideas and attitudes, and they had
a great effect on our society. When these earthquake victims go
back to their home towns, they won't like the way people live
there. They've seen modernity, wealth, movies, beautiful women.
They'll want to change things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who have lost their fear of the state,''
Altan continued. ``They saw from their experience in the earthquake
that the state has nothing to give them. They watched people die
because of the failures of the state. They're angry, and they'll
want to create something new, a new consciousness in those parts of
Turkey. I don't know if they can succeed, but it's a very
interesting development.''
</P>

<P>
   Among the earthquake victims who wants to leave is Emin Cakmak,
a craftsman who makes ceramic tiles. He left Sivas, one of Turkey's
most politically and culturally conservative towns, as a teen-ager
in 1966. Now, with his home and workshop in Golcuk destroyed, he
wants to return there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here because there wasn't any work in Sivas,'' Cakmak
said. ``But things are changing out there, and I think I could make
a living in Sivas now. The most important thing is to get out of
here. These towns where the earthquake hit are a mess, and they're
going to stay a mess for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to assess the work of the government and army in
earthquake relief, Cakmak said: ``If the state really cared about
human life, it would have been prepared for something like this.
The people of Turkey responded beautifully, and so did foreign
countries, even Greece, our supposed great enemy. But the state
didn't do much at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Such attitudes are potentially subversive in a land where ever
since the days of Ottoman sultans, people have been taught to
respect the state above all. President Suleyman Demirel reflected
this principle when he warned Turks to curb their anger over
problems in the relief effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be complaints, that is natural, but the state is
not a concept that you can replace with anything else,'' the
president said this week. ``So complaints should not turn into an
all-out criticism of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   That warning has been lost on many earthquake victims, among
them Emin Yildirim, a 50-year-old construction worker who lost
several close friends in the quake. He also lost his home, and has
spent the last two weeks living in a tent beside the Sea of
Marmara. As soon as he can put together enough cash for a bus
ticket, he said, he will move back home to Bayburt, an insular town
of 100,000 perched in the rugged mountains of northeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't rely on the state for anything,'' Yildirim said.
``You can only count on yourself, your family and your friends. I
have some skills and some ideas. Let's see what I can do with them
back in Bayburt.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said Thursday that if
elected president he would force schools in poor areas to perform
by threatening to take away federal money from those that fail and
allow parents to use it for private schools. Addressing a Hispanic
business association lunch, Bush, a Republican, dismissed most
existing federal educational programs as failures. But in a
departure from traditional Republican thinking, he outlined a
strategy that would increase the role of the federal Department of
Education by adding to it the Head Start program for preschoolers
and using federal funds to reward high-performing schools.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to the conservative preference for local control, Bush
said Washington should stay out of the business of setting
standards for schools, leaving that up to state and local
districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government must be humble enough to stay out of
the day-to-day operation of local schools, wise enough to give
states and school districts more authority and freedom, and strong
enough to require proven performance in return. When we spend
federal money, we want results _ especially when it comes to
disadvantaged children.''
</P>
<P>
   Education, which played only a modest role in the last
presidential election, has emerged as a top concern of voters and
the two parties are vying to demonstrate it has the means to
improve the nation's schools. Vice President Al Gore, who is
seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, devoted his first
major policy speech last spring to his plans for how the federal
government could bring about what he called ``revolutionary
change'' in education.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has emphasized his performance in Texas, where testing and
accountability have led to improved schools. But he has not used
state money there to reward or punish schools in the way he is
proposing.
</P>
<P>
   Bush Thursday carefully avoided using the politically sensitive
expression school vouchers. Vouchers, backed by many conservatives
and strongly opposed by many liberals, involve giving credits to
parents that could be used to remove children from public schools
and placed in private schools partly or wholly at government
expense.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said in his speech here Thursday that he would withdraw
federal funding from schools whose students tested poorly and that
parents of the children in those schools would receive as much as
$1,500 that could be used to send children to private schools or
other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and other leading Democrats oppose the use of school
vouchers, insisting they would weaken public schools by siphoning
away needed government funding. Secretary of Education Richard
Riley reacted to the speech by saying, ``No matter how you dress it
up, how long you delay it, or what you call it, a voucher is a
voucher. ... Vouchers undermine our public schools _ which educate
about 90 percent of our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Bush threaded together ideas of Democrats and
Republicans for his speech and many liberals reacted to Bush's plan
quite positively.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 80 percent are policies and initiatives we could support
and do support,'' said William L. Taylor, vice chair of the
Citizens Commission on Civil Rights, an associa- tion of former
federal officials who study education policy.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that while he favored the right of youngsters in
failing schools to opt out and go to schools that are succeeding,
they should be restricted to public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would fundamentally alter two major federal
programs, Head Start, which offers everything from day care and
meals to poor children, and Title I, which is the main fund of
federal dollars for poor schools. He would refocus both on
improving reading ability and other basic skills. He added that he
would allow private agencies to compete for and administer some of
those programs, which currently involve almost $13 billion a year
in spending, if the children in them test poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my administration, federal money will no longer follow
failure,'' he said. ``Public funds must be spent on things that
work.'' Bush did not address whether the private agencies would
then be tested, what kind of bureaucracy would be required to
handle the bidding for the contracts or what would happen to the
schools that lost federal funding.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, regarded as the frontrunner among the Republican
candidates, described federal programs as involving ``high hopes
and low achievement, grand plans and unmet goals.'' Indeed, one of
the most frequently used words in his speech here Thursday was
``failure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to start where educational failure has its highest
price,'' said Bush. ``I want to begin with the disadvantaged
children in struggling schools, and the federal role in helping
them.''
</P>
<P>
   He promised to reorganize what he characterized as a confusing
maze of federal programs with little emphasis on measurable
results.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been criticized by some of his opponents for being
short on specifics about policy, and he said Thursday's address
would be the first in a series of policy speeches on education,
which he described as one of his highest priorities. He spoke to
the Latino Business Association at the Los Angeles Convention
Center, and peppered his remarks with Spanish to a highly
appreciative audience, made up largely of entrepreneurs and small
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   The line that drew that strongest applause was: ``Some say it is
unfair to hold disadvantaged children to rigorous standards. I say
it is discrimination to require anything less, the soft bigotry of
low expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the ideas Bush outlined Thursday have been a part of his
educational strategy in Texas. He inherited some of those programs
from his Democratic predecessor, Ann Richards, as well as other
state administrations, but he has pursued testing and a focus on
teaching reading skills vigorously. Test results have risen
considerably in the state, particularly for minority students, but
the gap between white and minority children remains large.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not address many of Gore's education proposals. Gore,
for instance, has proposed making preschool universally available,
offering tax breaks to encourage saving for college, reductions in
the size of classes in public schools, testing of teachers to make
sure they live up to basic standards, and ensuring that students
develop a basic competency with computers by the eighth grade.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, by contrast, focused on teaching reading, particularly to
young children. He said that children should begin learning to read
at ages 3 and 4, and he insisted that the best method was phonics.
He said that the Head Start program should be changed to focus on
teaching reading to these young children and that the program
should be transferred from the Department of Health and Human
Services to the Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Bush equated failure to learn to read at a young age with a
propensity to turn to crime later in life. ``More and more, we are
divided into two nations, separate and unequal, one that reads and
one that can't, one that dreams and one that doesn't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush offered his clearest set of rewards and penalties for
schools that receive federal funds under the Title I program. He
said that the disadvantaged students at those schools would be
tested every year, with the tests written and administered by the
states, not the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Schools that show improvement, he said, would receive additional
federal grants. Bush has said he strongly favors reducing taxes and
cutting the federal budget, and he did not discuss how he would pay
for the grants Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Schools that test poorly, he added, would receive warnings. If
they continued to fail to show improvement for three years, the
Title I funds they receive would be divided up, matched by
additional federal money and given to the state. The state would
pass the money to the parents of the children in those schools _ as
much as $1,500 each per year _ and it could be used for tutoring,
switching the students to charter schools, semiautonomous public
schools, different public schools or private schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any case, the federal government will no longer pay schools
to cheat poor children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Effective reform requires accountability. Someone
should be praised when schools succeed, and someone must be
responsible when schools fail.'' He also insisted that, in spite of
the breadth of these federal initiatives, control over schools
would be placed largely in local hands, a policy that is central to
the conservative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In calling for each state, and not the federal government, to
devise the standards by which each student would be measured, Bush
succeeded in allaying the fears of some conservatives who worry
about centralized control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is betting where I personally always bet, that state
policy-makers and parents are likeliest to do right by kids,'' said
Chester E. Finn, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, which
studies educational issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bush sought to emphasize that he would remain flexible in
certain respects. He said that he would back bilingual education,
something many conservatives have fought bitterly, particularly in
California, if it proved effective in the form of better test
scores. He also said that he would back language immersion programs
if they could be shown to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``What matters is not the varying methods, but the common
standards and goals,'' Bush said. ``The standard is English
literacy. The goal is equal opportunity.''

THE WIZARD TURNS OUT TO BE AN ARTIST

<P>
   David T. Glenn, an architect, designs environments _ but not the
kind with apartments, shopping malls and offices. His environments,
where sorcerers trap the unwary and armies battle on treacherous
terrain, exist within the confines of computer games.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn is part of a trend in the computer game industry toward
using the skills of people trained in the traditional disciplines
of fine art, illustration and animation. He is a background artist,
designing the scenes in which the characters play out their fantasy
dramas in Diablo II, the sequel to the hit game from Blizzard
Entertainment. Blizzard, based in Irvine, Calif., is owned by
Vivendi SA.
</P>
<P>
   In the original Diablo, which has sold nearly two million copies
since its release in 1997, a character battling evil forces can go
through a simple entrance into a boxy dungeon with a shadowy
background. But the new game has settings like the palace designed
by Glenn: it has a dome, turrets, many entrances and elaborate
architectural details, and it sits in a cityscape of shops,
streets, walls and gates.
</P>
<P>
   The industry push away from jerky figures and cartoonlike
settings stems from leaps in computer technology and the higher
expectations of the avid players who buy the most games. According
to Computer Gaming World magazine, 14 percent of the buyers account
for 52 percent of sales.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high. A hit game can sell several hundred
thousand copies at $50 each, and the business is growing. Software
for interactive games generated sales of $5.4 billion in 1998,
according to the NPD Group, a market research firm in Port
Washington, N.Y., compared with $4.4 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But as sales have gone up, so has the cost of bringing a game to
market. It can take $2 million and 18 months for a game to reach
consumers, compared with $250,000 in the early '90s. Ron Gilbert,
the creative director of Cavedog Entertainment, a game designer in
Bothell, Wash., says costs have jumped because gamers won't buy a
game if the artwork isn't as sophisticated as the twists and turns
of the game itself.
</P>
<P>
   When Glenn received his bachelor of architecture degree at
Virginia Polytechnic Institute in 1993, jobs in architecture were
scarce. He found work designing office layouts and illustrating
structural concepts for architectural firms. Then in 1997, Maxis, a
subsidiary of Electronic Arts,the developer of the Simcity computer
games, hired the firm where Glenn was working to help prepare the
next version of the game. (In Simcity, players design, build and
manage virtual cities.) For Glenn, now 28, it was a life-changing
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became apparent,'' he said, ``that game design,
specifically game environments, offered more opportunity than
traditional architecture.''
</P>
<P>
   One big difference was financial. Glenn started with Blizzard in
January 1998 and now makes about three times as much money as he
did in his last architectural job. But he also found a creative
outlet. Architecture is about ``creating spaces in which people
will do things _ live, work, play,'' said Glenn, who works in the
company's San Mateo office, and though creating a game environment
is much the same, ``the game world can be anything you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the computer game industry, skills like Glenn's are in
demand. A check last week of the Web sites of several leading game
developers showed all had openings for artists or animators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game industry has many of the same traits as the movie
industry in that each new game has to be flashier than last year's
release,'' said Gilbert, who was a designer for George Lucas'
Lucasarts Entertainment before helping to found Cavedog. And in the
game business, as in Hollywood, only a few productions become hits.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton Kauzlaric, the lead designer for Cavedog's Total
Annihilation Kingdoms, a strategy game featuring wizards and magic,
has seen the change play out in the work forces of game-design
companies. ``When I first started developing games, there was one
graphic artist for every four programmers,'' he said. ``Now the
ratio is four artists for every programmer.''
</P>
<P>
   Kauzlaric tries to find designers with both artistic and
computer skills, but one of his successful hires was a commercial
artist with 20 years' experience who had never used a computer as a
design tool. ``The artistic experience he brought to game design is
not one you'd find in most programmers,'' Kauzlaric said.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn encourages others with artistic skills to look beyond
traditional jobs to consider game design.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on the success of the game, the worlds we create
will be experienced by millions of people,'' he said. ``Not only is
this satisfying in a creative sense, but it translates into far
better pay.''

  (With TEN-USOPEN) 
(DW) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Andre Agassi has to sidestep all banana peels, steer
clear of suspicious sushi and avoid anyone with so much as a
scratch in their throat. Because any fall, food poison or friend
carrying a cold could spell doom for the popularity meters at the
U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   With so much riding on him, Agassi might have to put his body
guard to good use and protect himself.
</P>
<P>
   After the injury exits of No. 1 seeded Pete Sampras,
fourth-seeded Patrick Rafter and eighth-seeded Carlos Moya, Agassi
is the people's choice to win the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   On his own, Agassi is the player still pulling people through
the turnstiles for the suddenly so-so men's draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not hard to get the intensity, but it feels different,''
Agassi said of playing in a Grand Slam without Sampras, Rafter and
now Moya, who retired with a back injury Thursday night. ``I think
they added a lot to the game of tennis. They add a lot to the
tournament. The tournament misses them. It's still going to be a
good Open, and I'll do my part.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi did his part Thursday. Relentlessly, he slapped the lines
on the court raw with precise and clean strokes to usher Axel
Pretzsch out of Arthur Ashe Stadium before he could soak up the
moment, 6-3, 6-2, 6-1. With few wasted motions, Agassi converted 6
of 10 break opportunities and spent no more than 33 minutes on any
set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess in hindsight you can look back and say, `OK, well,
it's good it didn't take a whole lot out of me,' '' Agassi said.
``But you know, there's always a level of intensity that goes along
with a match, especially at the U.S. Open that always makes it feel
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The only hard part was keeping his patience with the line calls.
Midway through the third set, Agassi stewed over a call and let out
his aggression with a 113-mile-an-hour serve to go up by 3-0 in the
third set. A few minutes later, Agassi was gathering his things and
focusing on the third round.
</P>
<P>
   With no one seeded higher than Marcelo Rios, seeded 10th,
remaining in his half of the draw, most assume Agassi will skip
into the final and walk away from the National Tennis Center with
his second U.S. Open title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, opinions don't matter a whole lot, you know?'' Agassi
said. ``They really don't, not when it comes down to getting it on
out there on the court. All it takes is one bad match for the U.S.
Open dreams to be squashed. I'm not confused as to what's required
to win any match, regardless of who it is that I'm playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, no one still walking is playing as well as Agassi.
After refocusing and fine-tuning his body following his divorce
from the actress Brooke Shields, he won the French Open and reached
the final at Wimbledon only to lose to Sampras in three sets.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty months after falling as low as 141 in the rankings,
Agassi briefly took the No. 1 ranking from Sampras in July.
</P>
<P>
   But as quickly as his career started breathing again, Agassi
understands how fragile success can be and how any complacency at
the Open could end the remarkable run he has had this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take much for it to change,'' Agassi said. ``I
don't mean with me, I just mean with sports. A few windows of
opportunity, and somebody can take advantage of you, and you can
have an off day. It's hard to play seven great matches. So a
difficult match is coming and I'm mentally focused enough to deal
with that, and hopefully get through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many are counting on Agassi to get through this Grand Slam and
stir the interest of the fans as well as bring happiness to the
television ratings' gods.
</P>
<P>
   If Agassi does not fall to an upset, injury or ailment, if he
follows the plan and finds his way to a title, he will not consider
it hollow without going through Sampras to get it.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi said he felt there was a great chance to win the Open,
regardless of whether Sampras and Rafter were playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to boil down to how well you play at the right
times,'' Agassi said. ``And to be quite honest, it's hard to think
matches ahead. I know it's easy sometimes from the outside to think
matches ahead, but for players, it's truly the next match that's
important.''  &QL;

   ``Every now and then I look over to see if his clothes are in
there,'' the Dolphins' tight end said. ``I keep expecting to walk
in here and see him sitting there.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one thing when that locker, which belongs to seven-time
Pro Bowl left tackle Richmond Webb, was empty July 30, the day that
veterans reported to training camp.
</P>
<P>
   That was expected. From the moment in February when the Dolphins
named Webb their franchise player for 1999, a designation that
basically prevented him from testing the free-agency market, nearly
everyone expected contract negotiations to drag into the
pre-season.
</P>
<P>
   But this far? Thursday _ the day of the exhibition finale at
Green Bay and 11 days before the regular-season opener at Denver _
little had changed.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins have refused to budge from the offer they initially
put on the table _ three years, $11.5 million _ alongside the
one-year tender of $3.42million they were required to make to
designate Webb as a franchise player. Webb and his agent, Steve
Zucker, want a long-term deal that pays close to $5million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Zucker gave Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson a new proposal this
week. And the Chicago-based agent hopes to meet with Johnson while
the team is in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the bottom line is the same.
</P>
<P>
   The locker remains empty.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the day before the team left for Green Bay, an
inevitable step in the negotiating process happened.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson began gushing about Brent Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Last pre-season, as defensive tackle Tim Bowens was holding out,
Johnson made backup Barron Tanner sound like the second coming of
Merlin Olsen.
</P>
<P>
   This pre-season, it was only a matter of time before Smith, who
has been starting at left tackle, earned rave reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, without being prompted, Johnson made a point to talk
about Smith, saying that the third-year player from Mississippi
State wasn't getting nearly enough attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brent has been doing an excellent job,'' he said, pointing to
Smith's play against Detroit defensive lineman Robert Porcher as an
example.
</P>
<P>
   When camp opened, Johnson said that would be the last day he
would talk about Webb. But when asked a question about the left
tackle position _ would he feel comfortable with Smith starting in
Denver? _ Johnson brought up the taboo name himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll volunteer it. ... I doubt if Richmond, if he came in
right now, would be prepared to play in the opener,'' he said.
``I'm not going to be firm on that. But the thought now would be
that Brent would be our left tackle.''
</P>
<P>
   While Johnson is taking his hard-line negotiating stance,
insisting his team is fine without Webb, the players who surround
that empty locker tell a different story.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that they trash Smith's ability. To the contrary, they
heap wildly optimistic praise on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kid could go to the island in two or three years,'' said
left guard Mark Dixon, referring to the Pro Bowl in Hawaii.
``You're talking that kind of talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, though, Dixon and seemingly every other
offensive lineman say this team needs Webb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the deal with Richmond, at least for me, is that he's
been through the fire,'' Dixon said.
</P>
<P>
   Right guard Kevin Donnalley said: ``When the games start to
count, he'd better be here, because he's one of the main reasons
Dan (Marino) has played going on 17 years. He's the guy who can
shut down Bruce Smith every week. Brent Smith is going to be a
great player, but it's only his third year. I think back on my
third year, that's when I first started at left tackle and it was a
tough, tough experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Smith scoffs at talk that he is ready to fill Webb's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Richmond's going to be here,'' he said. ``And I know
it's his position. I've just got to do the best job I can to hold
it down until he gets back.''
</P>
<P>
   When will that be?
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure. But Drayton listens to Johnson and has a sense
that it won't be long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think coach Johnson is factoring him into being with the
team next week,'' he said. ``I just have a feeling. ... I just
can't see us going into Denver without him.

 &HT;    New eras may start slowly in S. Carolina
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The programs at South Carolina and Clemson had a
combined record of 4-18 last season, one of the worst performances
for the state's two major universities.
</P>
<P>
   Both schools hired new coaches in the offseason to undertake
herculean rebuilding jobs. It is possible both teams will lose
their openers Saturday, and neither is expected to have a winning
season. Why, then, are both sets of fans so excited?
</P>
<P>
   Simple. With Tommy Bowden at Clemson and Lou Holtz at South
Carolina, the future looks bright. Which is good, because the
present _ particularly Saturday _ looks bleak.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, son of Florida State coach Bobby Bowden, makes his
Clemson debut at home against Marshall, which was a I-AA power when
the game was scheduled years ago. Today, however, the Thundering
Herd is the defending champion of the Division I Mid-America
Athletic Conference. The program, built by Georgia's Jim Donnan and
maintained by Bob Pruett, has won 101 games in the '90s, more than
any other college. Marshall returns 19 starters from a 12-1 team,
including quarterback Chad Pennington, a Heisman Trophy candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people are going to be surprised when
Marshall takes the field,'' said Bowden, who will try to become the
first Clemson coach to win his debut against a Division I school
since Frank Howard in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   The Lou Holtz era begins at South Carolina with an equally
daunting task. The Gamecocks, 1-10 a year ago, must travel to No.
24 North Carolina State. Playing the first game on the road is
tough enough, but now N.C. State has extra adrenaline from
Saturday's 23-20 upset of Texas in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Holtz, head coach at N.C. State 1972-75, arrives with a team
that began the preseason short on talent and then was decimated by
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had 28 guys to miss some practice because of injuries,''
said Holtz, returning to the sideline two years after leaving Notre
Dame. ``I can't tell you what the strength of our team is other
than we've worked hard. I have a lot of concerns, and I know we're
not a very good team right now.'' Holtz should have a pleasant
evening in Raleigh tonight, at a reunion of his former N.C. State
players. Saturday evening, however, could be less fun. The
Gamecocks' offensive and defensive lineups at times will include
two seniors, seven juniors, 10 sophomores and three freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   None of his previous 27 teams entered a season with so many
question marks, he said. ``I have absolutely no idea how we'll
respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden feels the same about his team. Clemson doesn't return a
starter on the offensive line for the first time since 1943. Its
leading rusher from a year ago, Travis Zachery, has been suspended
for the first game. Bowden has installed a new offense but isn't
sure whether either quarterback, Brandon Streeter or Woody
Dantzler, can run it the way Shaun King did for him last year at
Tulane.
</P>
<P>
   The defense, which lost six players to the NFL, does not have a
real star at linebacker for the first time in recent memory. The
result is that Bowden would feel better opening against Wofford.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this first game will do is establish a barometer of how
far this program has to go,'' he said. ``I would prefer an opener
where I could make some mistakes and still win.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite sagging attendance in recent years, more than 75,000
will be at Memorial Stadium on Saturday looking for a sign that a
new era is starting in Clemson football. And they expect to go home
with a win.
</P>
<P>
   Those expectations come with the job, Bowden said: ``Patience is
not a word you hear a lot around here.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ On her first trip to the Middle East since the
Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, came to power, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright hit a snag when the Israelis and
Palestinians failed to deliver an agreement for a signing ceremony
in Egypt Thursday that she hoped to preside over.
</P>
<P>
   After meetings in Egypt on Thursday with the Palestinian leader,
Yasser Arafat, and the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, Albright
arrived in Israel late in the night to meet with Barak. But after
talking for more than three hours into the early morning, the talks
broke up without a deal, according to Israeli officials.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's office said Israel was awaiting answers from the
Palestinians on whether they would accept Israeli proposals for
modifying a deal reached in Wye, Md., last fall. Israel expected to
receive those answers Friday morning, his office said.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiating atmosphere between the two sides that was
supposed to have substantially improved with the new Israeli leader
had not warmed sufficiently to allow the release of 50 Palestinian
prisoners now held in Israel. That issue stands in the way of
reviving the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear whether the dispute over the
prisoners constituted a real crisis or a matter of each side
wanting to show their constituencies that they were reaching for
the best possible bargain on an emotional issue.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who had delayed her trip for two weeks at the request
of the Israeli prime minister met with the Palestinian leader, and
the Egyptian president in Alexandria, Egypt, and then flew here for
a meeting early Friday morning with Barak.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, at the request of Barak, has taken
more of a back seat in the current negotiations, which cover
completion of a deal signed in Wye, Md., last fall in which Israel
agreed to give up West Bank land in exchange for greater security.
Being discussed is also the much broader question of a framework
for a permanent settlement.
</P>
<P>
   A failure to complete the agreement before the secretary leaves
for a scheduled visit on Saturday to Syria to meet the Syrian
President, Hafez Assad, in Damascus, would put a damper on her
ability to persuade Assad to restart negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Israeli desire for the Americans to keep a lower
profile and the administration's insistence that it was happy to
see both sides negotiating directly, Albright injected herself into
the process. She is to visit Jordan on Sunday and is trying to get
an agreement completed before she leaves the region for Asia later
that day.
</P>
<P>
   She met with Arafat, accompanied by one of his top security
officials, for more than an hour in Alexandria, and in the middle
of that meeting telephoned Barak.
</P>
<P>
   On the 40-minute flight from Alexandria to Tel Aviv, a senior
administration official played down the gravity of the logjam, and
said that both sides were making ``a very serious effort.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that only a few issues were left to resolve, and that an
agreement might be reached Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Albright was not playing the role of ``mediator'' but rather
conveying concerns and making suggestions, he said. ``They've done
the vast majority of the work,'' the official said of the Israelis
and Palestinians. They had been assisted a great deal, he said, by
the Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian foreign minister, Amr Moussa, standing beside
Albright at a news conference here after Palestinian and Israeli
flags that had been readied for a ceremony were put aside, said the
agreement could be completed in ``hours'' or ``days.'' When it was
ready, Moussa said he expected a ceremony to take place in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   The administration official declined to specify whether the
prisoner issue was the sole hurdle to be overcome, but suggested
that several other issues had become interrelated as the
negotiations went down to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis see the ``security prisoners,'' as opposed to
criminals, as terrorists, but the Palestinians view them as freedom
fighters who fought against the occupation of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In their negotiations, the Israelis agreed to release 350
prisoners but the Palestinians wanted 400 released. The Israelis
have insisted that they would not release any prisoner who murdered
an Israeli and that there were not 50 more prisoners who met their
criteria for release.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoner issue became suddenly even more sensitive for Barak
after a young Orthodox Jewish couple were found stabbed to death
last weekend. On Wednesday, the military arm of Hamas, an Islamic
fundamentalist group, claimed responsibility for the killings.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank and Gaza earlier this week, mothers
demonstrated with framed photographs of their jailed sons.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoner issue is also difficult because the types of
prisoners to be released was not specified in the original Wye
memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for the release of 750 prisoners, but other
details _ whether the prisoners to be released were criminals or
``security'' prisoners _ were decided in oral agreements among
President Clinton, Arafat, and Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime
minister at the time.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On the question of the turnover of land that was called for in
the Wye agreement, the current negotiations envision the Israelis
ceding 11 percent more of the West Bank to full or partial
Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   The first 2 percent of the 13 percent called for at Wye was
turned over by Netanyahu who then stopped the implementation of the
accord.
</P>
<P>
   Barak wants to combine the final withdrawal of Israeli troops
called for in the Wye agreement into progress in the permanent
status negotiations. This is desirable for Barak because the last _
and largest withdrawal _ mandated by Wye would leave about 15
Jewish settlements virtually encircled by Palestinian-controlled
land.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the prisoner issue, Barak's call for a specific
date early in the new year for a framework on the permanent status
negotiations has also been a sticking point for Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, relieved at the election in May of
Barak as prime minister, and the defeat of Netanyahu, would like to
get the permanent status talks going as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary was accompanied here by the administration's top
Middle East negotiators - presidential advisor Dennis Ross, Martin
Indyk, who is the assistant secretary of state for the Near East,
and Middle East expert Aaron Miller.
</P>
<P>
   In the current negotiations, Barak is seeking a date early in
the New Year for a framework agreement on permanent status talks.
Arafat is said to be nervous about a defined date. These talks
would define the hardest issues of all _ the future of Jerusalem,
the return of refugees and the borders of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   These questions could be settled by the end of 2000, the
Israelis argue, a date that does not displease Clinton who leaves
office then and sees a permanent settlement in the Middle East as a
crowning glory of his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of the overall,'' Albright said about the final
status talks during her flight from Washington, ``this is a very
high priority for President Clinton. You can figure out the timing
for yourself.''

DEADLY SUMMER RAISES CONCERN ON THRILL RIDES

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VALLEJO, Calif. _ With summer slipping away, 16-year-old Dhar
Basra was losing his chance to get his fill of hair-raising
excitement. On the day he and five friends made it here to Six
Flags Marine World, two of the amusement park's three roller
coasters were closed for repairs, including the now-notorious
Boomerang, which jerked to a halt last week, leaving passengers
hanging 70 feet in the air in 100-degree heat for up to four hours.
</P>
<P>
   Dhar and his buddies had to be content to find their thrills on
Kong, a ride with enough corkscrews and plunges to send them coming
back for more. In fact, more people were waiting for Kong than for
any other ride here, suggesting that a recent spate of deadly
accidents on amusement park rides has yet to deter the coaster
faithful. Accidents? ``They don't worry me,'' Dhar said with a
shrug. ``I don't even think of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Such words are no doubt music to the ears of operators of the
nation's amusement parks. Six deaths on rides, four of them in the
last two weeks, and a host of mishaps like the one on the Boomerang
are raising new questions about the safety of amusement rides.
</P>
<P>
   As amusement parks are becoming more and more popular, and
bigger, taller, faster coasters are built (59 opened in the United
States this year alone), are they becoming more dangerous? Are ride
operators not getting the training they need to assure the safety
of passengers? Are riders taking more foolish risks _ like standing
up when they should be sitting _ and causing their own injuries?
Are parks not maintaining their rides properly? Or are the deaths
and accidents this year an unfortunate coincidence?
</P>
<P>
   No one knows for sure. There is no federal oversight of
amusement parks; 40 states have their own safety regulations, 10
have none. But as the industry grows, an increasing number of
critics are calling for stricter, more uniform regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a problem here,'' said Ann Brown, chairwoman of the
U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, which compiles the data on
amusement park accidents but, since Congress amended regulations in
1981, has no authority to investigate them.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Day holiday, the last hurrah of the summer,
traditionally brings more visitors to the nation's 750 amusement
and theme parks than any other weekend of the year besides Memorial
Day, so a panicked industry is rushing to defend itself.
</P>
<P>
   Citing government statistics, amusement park officials are quick
to say that the deaths this year are indeed a horrible coincidence
_ a statistical anomaly in an industry that serves nearly 300
million visitors, up from 250 million eight years ago. Since
parkgoers take roughly 900 million rides a year, and permanent
parks (as opposed to the mobile, carnival-type) average two deaths
per year, industry officials say, riding a coaster is safer than
driving to the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the accidents this year are terrible, it's important to
keep them in perspective,'' said Joel Cliff, a spokesman for the
International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions, based
in Alexandria, Va. Even as park attendance has mushroomed, the
average number of people killed in parks each year over the last 20
years has remained the same, he said, adding that there were 100
fewer accidents in 1998 than the year before. And of the 4,500
injuries on rides last year, he said, citing federal statistics,
only 36 required hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   The recent deaths at parks all over the country offer no clear
pattern. A woman and her 8-year-old daughter were killed last
Saturday on the Wild Wonder coaster in Ocean City, N.J., when both
the hook and chain towing their car to the top and the safety
device designed to hold the car in traction failed, plunging the
passengers backward before hurling them to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 22, a disabled 12-year-old boy at Paramount's Great
America in Santa Clara plunged about 100 feet to his death on the
Drop Zone, a ride that lifts four-person cars 200 feet into the air
and drops them at 62 miles an hour. Park inspectors, after a
preliminary investigation, said there ``appears to be no mechanical
failure'' on the ride, though police are still investigating. The
Drop Zone and three similar rides in other Paramount parks have
been closed.
</P>
<P>
   The Shockwave, a stand-up coaster at another Paramount park,
Kings Dominion in Virginia, has reopened after a 20-year-old
college student fell to his death Aug. 23. (A Paramount spokeswoman
said that the two deaths were an ``unfortunate coincidence'' and
that the company, with five theme parks in this country and Canada,
and that there had been five fatal accidents in the parks' 27-year
history.) Park officials said the passenger on the Shockwave had
deliberately wriggled free of his safety harness.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff of the amusement parks association said analyses of
accidents had shown that ``rider misconduct'' was responsible for
65 percent to 85 percent of all accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``That can range from not paying attention to ride signage that
says you shouldn't go on a ride if you're pregnant or have certain
conditions, to not paying attention to verbal commands, especially
not keeping hands or arms inside, to just plain common sense,''
Cliff said. As for overseeing riders, he said: ``Ride operators
should do everything they can to make sure patrons have a safe,
enjoyable ride. But there's only so much you can do with a human
being.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the industry's statistics are self-serving and
unprovable, because in many states, injury reports are
confidential.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't know,'' said Ms. Brown of the Consumer Product
Safety Commission, who would like her agency to regain its
regulatory control over permanent amusement parks, much the way it
regulates and inspects carnival-style portable amusement rides.
</P>
<P>
   Nonfatal accidents at amusement parks have increased in the last
five years, according to statistics compiled by the safety
commission. A report shows a jump to 4,300 injuries in 1996 from
2,800 in 1995. But Cliff of the amusement park association said the
increase reflected a different method of compiling and analyzing
accident data.
</P>
<P>
   California has the highest rate of ride-accident deaths in the
country, with 15 in the last 25 years, and the largest number of
roller coasters: 48. While the number of deaths is relatively
small, industry critics say there is no way to examine California's
accidents because the state has no regulations for the industry.
State Assemblyman Tom Torlakson introduced a bill in January that
would regulate inspections, accident reports and training records
by state inspectors. The bill has been vigorously opposed by
industry lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent deaths, thrills-and-chills seekers seem
undaunted. Amusement park officials say that they are still on
track to improve attendance over last year. Patrons interviewed at
Six Flags Marine World, as in other parks, said they would continue
to go on their favorite rides.
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl Miles of Sacramento chalked the accidents off to bad
luck. And while she never goes on rides, her husband and
13-year-old daughter were not concerned, she said. ``The rides are
probably safer now than ever,'' she said, ``with all the scrutiny
they're getting.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the afternoon, work crews walked up and down the
tracks of the Boomerang, inspecting and changing parts to prepare
the coaster to reopen by the big Labor Day weekend. Parkgoers
stopped and stared and pointed, but the most popular question they
asked a security worker posted at the entrance was ``When will it
open?''

STEVENS FEELS BETTER THAN EVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gary Stevens returned to America last weekend, bringing bad news
for his rival jockeys.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old Hall of Famer thinks he's a better rider after
nearly three months riding in England and the European Continent
for Newmarket-based trainer Michael Stoute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the best experience I've had in horse racing,
just the variety of racecourses day in and day out,'' Stevens said
at Del Mar on Sunday. ``I'm probably a little sharper mentally,
able to assess things in a race a little quicker than before I went
over there.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're turning right, turning left, going uphill, going
downhill, riding in 25-, 35-horse fields, it's like being on the
Hollywood Freeway at 5 o'clock doing 100 miles an hour. It took me
some time to feel I was up to speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens enjoyed the change from the daily sameness of U.S.
racing marked by small fields and flat left-hand ovals.
</P>
<P>
   He also enjoyed more success than the English press expected,
winning 47 of his 229 races, including Group 1 victories aboard
Royal Anthem and Zahrat Dubai, and earning $2.3 million in purses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd wake up at 5 o'clock in the morning looking forward to
going to the racetrack,'' Stevens said. ``I'd lost that a little
bit (in America). The only time I'd get excited was when it was a
$500,000 race or when there was a horse who I knew was going to be
something special.''
</P>
<P>
   What he didn't enjoy in England was the long drives required by
that country's racing schedule.
</P>
<P>
   So when Saudi Prince Ahmed Salman's Thoroughbred Corp. offered
him a contract to ride first call on that ownership group's horses
in the United States, Stevens jumped at the chance to come home.
</P>
<P>
   Such agreements rarely last long. Jockeys find the commitment to
one owner's horses forces them to pass up too many promising
mounts.
</P>
<P>
   But an unusual feature of Stevens' contract seems to guarantee
he'll stick with it: He is promised a position as the Thoroughbred
Corp. racing manager following his retirement from riding.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens expects to ride for five more years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think when I'm done with riding I won't have to do
anything (to earn a living),'' he said. ``But I'm not that kind of
person. I love horses and I'd love to be involved in racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens doesn't think he has the patience to follow his father
Ron into a training career. He figures he'd need 20 years to learn
that end of the business.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he's been a jockey for 20 years and he's still
learning about riding.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' first U.S. race since May resulted in a gate-to-wire
victory aboard Saints Cup in a 2-year-old maiden race at Saratoga
last Saturday. The next day he rode at Del Mar and won aboard the
claimer Distant Venture in the opening race.
</P>
<P>
   Fans thought they noticed Stevens riding in a more European
posture. He explained the English experience taught him to vary his
style for different horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always try to learn something,'' he said. ``I thought I was
a better rider when I came back from Hong Kong (where he competed
in early 1995), and I think I'm a better rider how.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mr. Sensitivity: &LR;  Basil DeVito, a National Thoroughbred Racing
Association senior vice president, raised eyebrows during a
conference call with reporters when he described the spate of
injuries to Pacific Classic favorites as ``marketing
disappointments, not equine tragedies.''
</P>
<P>
   I think DeVito meant to say the injuries to Victory Gallop, Real
Quiet and Mazel Trick weren't tragedies because the horses
survived. But it was the kind of thoughtless comment NTRA
executives must avoid lest they appear to care more about selling
the sport than about the sport itself.
</P>
<P>
   It might be too late. Leaders of the fledgling national
governing body seem a little too impressed with themselves for
getting network and cable TV exposure with the ``NTRA Champions on
Fox'' series. More exposure for an inadequate product is not a
winning equation.
</P>
<P>
   The series itself was a joke. After the 11th and final race, can
anybody identify the champion? Is it Behrens, who had three
victories and a series-high 46 points but not a penny to show for
it because he missed the climactic Pacific Classic at Del Mar last
Sunday? Or is it General Challenge, who won the Pacific Classic and
collected a series-high $100,000 bonus despite missing the first 10
events?
</P>
<P>
   If it's General Challenge, then isn't it odd that the series
designed as a showcase for older thoroughbreds was won by a
3-year-old?
</P>
<P>
   The streak of breakdowns, out of the NTRA's control, was largely
to blame. But the series format should have anticipated the
inevitable injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the format will change for 2000, de-emphasizing the
final race, NTRA commissioner Tim Smith said at Del Mar. So there's
hope.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Down the stretch: &LR;  The Ramona Handicap, the Del Mar Futurity
and a tight jockeys' race are the attractions as Del Mar heads to
closing day Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tuzla (David Flores) and Tranquility Lake (Chris McCarron) are
co-highweights at 121 pounds among 10 filly and mare turf
specialists in Saturday's Ramona. Tuzla can make Bob Baffert the
first trainer to sweep Del Mar's five Grade I races. Tranquility
Lake is trained by ex-Tuzla trainer Julio Canani and would be a
fitting spoiler.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert plans to send Forest Camp, Captain Steve and Cameron
Pass in pursuit of the trainer's fourth straight Futurity victory
on Wednesday. Richard Mandella-trained Dixie Union (Alex Solis) is
favored.
</P>
<P>
   Solis went into Thursday's races leading by two victories over
David Flores, four over Corey Nakatani and six over Chris McCarron.
</P>
<P>
   McCarron rides Old Trieste in the colt's comeback in Sunday's
Del Mar Breeders' Cup Handicap. &QL;

 &HT;    UT sweats details to beat the heat
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Winds were suffocatingly calm and the
temperature hit a searing 95 degrees when the University of Texas
kicked off to North Carolina State last Saturday night at
Royal-Memorial Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't your stereotypical, crisp autumn Saturday, just a late
August evening in Austin, when high heat is a given. But despite
the heat and humidity, the Longhorn players, who had been working
out as a group outside all summer, suffered few heat-related
problems in the sweltering conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I was sweaty, but the kids handled it well,'' said UT
coach Mack Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday presents another heated test.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of ABC network officials, the game between Texas
and Stanford at Memorial Stadium was moved from an evening to an 11
a.m. kickoff. According to the early forecast by the National
Weather Service office in New Braunfels, the temperature at kickoff
will be in the mid-to-high 80s, with the humidity at about 60
percent. By halftime, temperatures will be in the low 90s and by
game's end, around 95. The heat index, which takes into account the
actual temperature and humidity, will be in the low 100s.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorn training staff is anticipating no severe problems,
but will be prepared with two dozen, one-liter bags of an
intravenous sugar and saline solution to give players who are
suffering from muscle cramps and other symptoms of heat exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the Stanford players? The team practices each day
in almost ideal weather conditions. The highs this week in Palo
Alto, Calif., have been in the low to mid-70s, with little
humidity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the guys it was going to be hot,'' said Stanford wide
receiver Troy Walters, who spent his high school years at A&AMP;M
Consolidated in College Station. ``Coach has told us we don't have
to live there, just play there for three hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford coach Tyrone Willingham said: ``I think there will
probably be a lot said or made of the fact the ballgame is at 9 our
time, 11 their time, and it will be 99 degrees there and only 65
degrees here. For us, as far as the time, we're very fortunate that
. . . during two a days we've been practicing at a similar time, so
I think that helps in preparation. I don't think there's any
preparation you can do for 100 degrees, or 99 degrees. It's going
to be hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph Chorley, an assistant professor at the Baylor College
of Medicine in Houston who specializes in sports medicine, said it
takes between 10 and 14 days for an athlete to acclimate to such
harsh temperatures. And that's only if the athlete exercises in the
heat each day for 30-45 minutes or longer.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Texas has used early home kickoffs in September to its
advantage. The Longhorns usually play a morning or afternoon game
at Memorial Stadium each September. In 1993, underdog UT was able
to pull off a 21-21 tie with then-No. 6 Syracuse. The Longhorns
followed that early September success with a 30-16 win over
Louisville in 1994 and a 38-27 victory over Pittsburgh in 1995.
There are ways to prepare players for the heat so that they don't
suffer from symptoms such as headache, dizziness and severe muscle
cramps.
</P>
<P>
   UT trainer Tom McVan said that he ordered players, starting five
days before the game, to drink as much water or noncaffeinated,
noncarbonated liquid as they could hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told them to drink so much that they have to wake up at
night to go to the bathroom,'' McVan said.
</P>
<P>
   Players are urged to drink a cup of water every 20 minutes
during practice or whenever they get off the field during a game.
</P>
<P>
   UT also has purchased two Cool Capes, which literally are
uniform capes hooked up by three hoses to a air conditioning unit,
to keep the players cool. The cape is draped over a player, who
then feels the same effects of sitting in a well air-conditioned
room.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, UT has tried to schedule its September games for
an early evening kickoff. But television networks often get schools
to change game times in exchange for national exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ABC will show UT-Stanford to about one-third of the country,
which includes the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to turn down national exposure these
days,'' said Chris Plonsky, UT associate athletic director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we thought about the heat, we are concerned about it as
we speak. . . . It's not like we're sitting here being mercenary.
But we have 20 sports to support. We have nice facilities and we
have to maintain those nice facilities. None of that is cheap _ we
have to pay our own bills.''

 &HT;    Hard case: Trump takes tortoise to task
 &HT;    By Trebor Banstetter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A family of gopher tortoises crawled
briefly between Donald Trump and the completion of his $40 million
golf course Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The never-shy celebrity hadn't balked at lavishing every luxury
on the 214-acre course across from the Palm Beach County Jail. And
he'd spent hundreds of thousands more planting royal palm trees
along the roads leading to the fairways.
</P>
<P>
   But he tried to draw the line at an extra $45,000 the county
required he spend afterbecoming the first person to get nailed with
new road landscaping rules.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed the whole flap on the tortoises.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Trump International Golf Club in suburban West Palm
Beach has been under construction since 1997, the county only
recently asked the owner of Palm Beach's Mar-a-Lago to make room
for the endangered Florida gopher tortoises that live on the land.
</P>
<P>
   Trump had agreed to add another 3.1 acres to the project just
for the tortoise family. But he didn't expect to get snagged by new
rules county commissioners passed last week. They require any
developer who enlarges his project to landscape the traffic
separators _ narrow concrete barriers between lanes _ on adjacent
roads.
</P>
<P>
   That's just not fair, Trump representative Bob Bentz argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't have to do this if the county hadn't come and
asked us to create this habitat for the turtles,'' said Bentz, a
land planner with West Palm Beach-based Land Design South.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of Trump's international reputation for excess,
that argument didn't win much sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Donald is known throughout the world for going first-class
on everything,'' said Zoning Commissioner Kevin Foley. ``I don't
know why he's trying to duck this condition.''
</P>
<P>
   The zoning commission ruled against Trump, 4-2. The decision is
final.
</P>
<P>
   Trump did not return telephone calls Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The legally protected tortoises have played havoc with projects
before. Earlier this year, Carver Middle School in Delray Beach had
to build portable classrooms on athletic fields because part of its
campus was fenced off to protect a tortoise nest.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, there were more tortoises in the state than
people. But their population has dwindled to less than 1 million,
and they've been an endangered species since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The county's environmental resource management department has
known about the tortoises for some time, said environmental analyst
Milton Battles.
</P>
<P>
   The exact number of family members is somewhat of a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Battles nor Bentz was sure why the county requested the
tortoise habitat so late into the development of the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   But Trump was also adding an additional acre for landscaping and
open space. Though Bentz disagreed, Zoning Commissioner Sherry
Hyman said that might have triggered the beautification rules
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sympathize, because it did come from the county,'' she said.
``But in the grand scheme of things, this isn't a whole lot of
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Beautifying the narrow traffic separator will be difficult,
Bentz said, because a pipe will have to be installed under the road
to feed a sprinkler system.
</P>
<P>
   Bentz also pointed out that Trump didn't skimp on the
landscaping he's already done, lining the entryway with hundreds of
towering royal palm trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do is drive down there and you'll see how
dramatically we've changed the area,'' Bentz said.
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't disclose an exact price tag, but said that the trees
cost about $1,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Still, zoning commissioners insisted that the additional
landscaping is a must.
</P>
<P>
   ``That intersection looks like garbage now,'' Hyman said.
</P>
<P>
   Trump's golf club is tentatively scheduled to open in the fall.
</P>

A BIG CHALLENGE AWAITS GOLFERS IN HAWAII
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANEOHE, Hawaii _ Tell someone you are playing the Ko'olau Golf
Club, and if they are familiar with the course their reaction is
pretty much the same.
</P>
<P>
   A smile flashed across the face of our bellman at the Outrigger
Waikiki when I told him where I planned to golf as he was taking my
clubs out of the trunk of our rental car. He nodded and offered
some sage advice, a variation on the familiar refrain offered by
golfers around the world who have been humbled by courses to which
their games did not measure up: ``Take lots of balls.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, we've all heard that one before. Besides, I had a bag full
of balls.
</P>
<P>
   But the last thing Ko'olau (pronounced Ko oh low, as in cow)
general manager Rob Nelson said before I teed off made me wonder if
there was indeed something to this golf ball business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good luck. Do you have enough balls?'' he asked in a tone
devoid of mirth. It was as if he was asking someone going into
battle if they had enough bullets.
</P>
<P>
   And for good reason. Ko'olau Golf Club is billed as ``the
world's most challenging golf course,'' a boast made by a number of
upscale venues around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, the folks at Ko'olau are not bragging.
</P>
<P>
   And they have the numbers to back them up.
</P>
<P>
   From the back tees Ko'olau, managed by Santa Monica-based
American Golf Corp., covers 7,310 yards and plays to a par of 72
with a slope rating, which measures the degree of difficulty, of a
whopping 162.
</P>
<P>
   American Golf could also call it one of the world's most
beautiful and unique courses and they would not be making an idle
boast.
</P>
<P>
   Ko'olau was carved out of a tropical rain forest below the
famous Pali Lookout. The course takes its name from the mountain
range that towers above the fairways and greens.
</P>
<P>
   The course was designed by Jack Tuthill and was originally owned
by a Japanese company that planned to sell memberships for more
than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   That would have also made it one of the world's most expensive
courses. The former owners got clobbered by the recession in Asia
and current owners bought the facility in a bankruptcy sale, then
hired American Golf to get it into shape.
</P>
<P>
   That process is still going on, but one thing that won't change
is the degree of difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   There are four sets of tees to accommodate various skill levels.
That way, golfers can shoot for the same landing areas. The
challenge is hitting them.
</P>
<P>
   It is target golf from tee to green.
</P>
<P>
   And it could have been worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rebuilt every bunker on the golf course and grassed over 12
of them,'' Nelson said. ``The real challenge is from the back tees,
but every hole is unique.''
</P>
<P>
   American Golf is also using some psychology in setting up the
course. While there are four sets of tees, none are red, which
usually denote the women's tees.
</P>
<P>
   At Ko'olau, the tees are called forward (white), resort (blue),
championship (gold) and tournament (black).
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want a test, play the golds,'' Nelson said. ``But it's
probably going to be fun from the blues. If you play the right tees
for your game, it's going to be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the course difficult is there's no out of bounds. The
fairways are lined with lush tropical vegetation, featuring an
abundance of Hawaiian flowers and critters.
</P>
<P>
   If you hit a ball past the rough and into the forest or ravine
that winds through the course, there is no chance of finding it.
</P>
<P>
   Ko'olau does have a big appetite for balls.
</P>
<P>
   And even though the course is not on the Pacific Ocean, as are
many of Hawaii's best courses, the views are astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   The course, which is about 20 minutes from Honolulu, could
easily have doubled as the set for Jurassic Park.
</P>
<P>
   Fairways tumble and climb through three climate zones and offer
views of cascading waterfalls or the Pacific in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   Golf carts feature a Global Positioning System that lets golfers
pinpoint their location and distance to the green from any point on
a fairway.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as spectacular as the course is the 125,000-square foot
clubhouse, which includes a Japanese hot bath in the men's locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   Greens fees for non-residents are $100 and $65 after 1:30 p.m.,
a bargain in this state.
</P>
<P>
   So how tough is this course, really?
</P>
<P>
   I shot a 111 and lost six balls in relatively benign wind
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   American Golf's Nelson says players usually do better the second
time around.
</P>
<P>
   I can't wait for my rematch. &QL;

FORMER SENATOR COULD LEAD NEW WACO INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo.)  (See also WACO-RENO-FREEH) 
(mk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Justice Department officials have held serious
discussions with former Sen. John Danforth, a Missouri Republican,
about leading a new broad-based inquiry into what happened at the
Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, in 1993, Clinton
administration officials said Thursday night .
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that a final decision had not been made and
that there was at least one other plausible candidate, a former
U.S. attorney who is being thought of as a fall-back choice. They
noted that Danforth, who retired from the Senate in 1994, fit most,
if not all, of the requirements set by Attorney General Janet Reno
for the person who would lead the inquiry. Reno has emphasized to
aides that she is seeking to recruit a nationally known Republican
with a strong reputation for integrity to aid the credibility of
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, who now practices law in St. Louis, did not return
telephone calls to his office.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also disclosed Thursday that Reno believed that
the FBI had concealed from her a second audio recording made at
Waco on the day that the Branch Davidian compound erupted in
flames, killing some 80 people, many of them children.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Reno ordered U.S. marshals to enter the FBI's
headquarters across Pennsylvania Avenue from the Justice Department
and seize a tape recording of conversations between field
commanders and agents that dealt with the firing of pyrotechnic
tear-gas canisters on the day of the assault. It was the recent
disclosure that such canisters had been used despite years of
denials by the FBI and Reno that prompted her to complain that she
had been badly served by the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The second tape was made between 10 a.m and noon on the day of
the assault and officials asked to retain it to make a transcript
with their sophisticated playback machines. But Reno refused and
asked that the tape be turned over to the marshals along with the
one that dealt with the canisters.
</P>
<P>
   A transcript of the first tape, made between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m.
on April 19, details a sometimes inaudible conversation between two
FBI officials that culminates in the order to fire the canisters.
According to a transcript of the conversation, Richard Rogers, the
agent in charge from the bureau's elite Hostage Rescue Team,
questions a subordinate, Stephen McGavin, supervisory special agent
of the rescue team, about the feasibility of firing the canisters.
</P>
<P>
   The transcript shows McGavin suggesting that an agent armed with
the canisters can fire them ``at the construction project'' with
relative safety using a vehicle for cover.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers responds, ``You're talking about the block over top the
construction?'' That site has since been identified as a concrete
bunker some 25 to 30 yards from the wooden residence where the
Davidians resided.
</P>
<P>
   McGavin then says that the agent armed with the canisters
believes he can use a truck for cover and ``attempt to penetrate it
with military rounds.'' He then asks for permission to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, that's affirmative,'' Rogers responds.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what is on the second tape, which was not
transcribed by officials until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials also spent Thursday hurriedly
pondering who should be asked to lead the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who returned to Washington Thursday from Panama, has
scheduled a news conference for Friday morning. It remained
unclear, however, if she and her aides would be able to move fast
enough to have someone in place by the time she meets with
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Some candidates who were considered earlier had to be discarded
because of conflicts, as in the case of Dan K. Webb, a Chicago
attorney and a former high-profile federal prosecutor. As a private
lawyer, Webb has represented Larry Potts, a former senior bureau
official involved in the Waco standoff from Feb. 28, 1993, until
the fatal conflagration on April 28, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, who turns 63 on Sunday, was nicknamed by many in the
Senate ``Saint Jack'' _ to some a jovial appellation, for others a
rueful reference to his stern, sometimes righteous demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   He became best known to the public, however, in the summer of
1991, when he vigorously defended the nomination of Judge Clarence
Thomas to the Supreme Court. Usually mild-mannered, Danforth shed
his reserve to wage war on behalf of Thomas, who had once worked
for him and was a close friend.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions with Danforth, officials said Thursday night,
concerned the degree of independence he would enjoy and the reach
of the investigation's subpoena power.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery that the pyrotechnic canisters were used may have
touched off a major brawl between Reno and Louis Freeh, the FBI
director, and angered many members of Congress, but no one has
suggested there is any new evidence that the FBI started the fatal
fire. The canisters were fired six hours before the deadly fire.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Thursday night that he
thought any new inquiry should be narrow in scope.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing might be getting out of hand,'' he said.
Perhaps the FBI behaved badly in not disclosing facts, but ``no new
facts have come out, certainly none that suggest there is anything
wrong with the main conclusion that David Koresh was responsible
for setting the fire,'' Schumer said, referring to the Branch
Davidian leader.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Rules Against U.S. in Waco Case
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Justice Department lost a bid Thursday to block an
order to turn over evidence related to the Branch Davidian case.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 9, Judge Walter Smith of U.S. District Court in Waco,
Texas, had ordered all agencies possessing any evidence ``in any
way relevant'' to the case to turn it over to his court.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers sought to block the order, but Smith
on Thursday denied their motion, saying the government must turn
over the evidence by Oct. 1. Beginning on Oct. 18, Smith is
scheduled to preside over a wrongful death civil lawsuit brought by
relatives of deceased Branch Davidian followers. Lawyers for the
plaintiffs have complained that the government has refused access
to evidence under its the control. The Texas Department of Public
Safety, which also controls evidence collected from the Branch
Davidian compound, had asked Smith earlier this summer to take
control of everything.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's order, Smith said that consolidating the evidence
with the court would not only make it accessible to all civil
litigants but also ``would, hopefully, deflect the suspicion
reported in the press, whether warranted or not, that there is a
massive cover-up regarding the evidence that was seized and
generated as a result of the Branch Davidian criminal case.''

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Ariel Sharon, the aging but pugnacious former
warrior, captured the leadership of the opposition Likud Party in
primaries Thursday night, succeeding Benjamin Netanyahu, who had
quit after he lost his bid to be re-elected prime minister in May.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon, 71, an energetic veteran of many Israeli military and
political battles, overwhelmingly defeated two leaders of a younger
generation of Likudniks: Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, 54, and Meir
Sheetrit, 51, who served as chairman of Netanyahu's governing
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   While Olmert had made clear that he had his sights set on
becoming prime minister, Sharon had said that he would serve only
as the steward of a party left greatly demoralized by its defeat in
May. He promised to hold new primaries in two years to select the
Likud candidate for prime minister in the next national elections.
``Let's rebuild the movement and prepare the Likud to win the next
elections,'' Sharon told followers at party headquarters in Tel
Aviv early Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts theorized Thursday night that Sharon would
end up serving as a place-holder for a resurgent Netanyahu, who has
withdrawn from public view since he was trounced by Ehud Barak, the
new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   That expectation, nurtured by Sharon, certainly motivated many
followers of Netanyahu to vote for him. Indeed, when Netanyahu
showed up to cast his own vote Thursday, he was trailed by acolytes
chanting, ``He'll be back.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is no question that this is also a comeback of sorts
for Sharon, a general, lawyer and gentleman farmer who is a
larger-than-life Israeli character.
</P>
<P>
   Always seeking to rehabilitate a reputation tainted by the 1982
Israeli invasion of Lebanon, which he directed as defense minister,
Sharon will for the first time take the helm of his own party.
</P>
<P>
   White-haired, portly and ever re-chargeable, Sharon has said he
hopes to revitalize the ailing Likud. As a low voter turnout
Thursday demonstrated, the the party is riven by internal strife
and an ideological identity crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Since Likud endorsed the most recent Israeli-Palestinian peace
agreement, it gave up its mantle as protector of the land of Israel
against territorial compromise and joined the large, amorphous
political center. In the May elections, it was greatly weakened,
capturing only 19 of the 120 seats in parliament, second to One
Israel/Labor's 26.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon, a former foreign minister and defense minister, has
always brought out extreme emotions in Israelis. He is revered by
some and despised by others.
</P>
<P>
   On the world stage and in a good part of Israel, he never
succeeded in overcoming his responsibility for the invasion of
Lebanon and the massacres that followed. He will be always be
closely associated with the slaughter of Palestinian refugees by
Israel's ally, the Lebanese Christian Phalangists.
</P>
<P>
   The massacre cost him his job as defense minister, after a
government investigating commission held him liable for failing to
prevent the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon has bounced back politically over time _ partly because
many Israelis believed that the invasion of Lebanon was ultimately
redeemed by its success in crushing the Palestine Liberation
Organization's military structure. But he was always in someone
else's shadow, however outsized his hovering presence in the
background.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he will take over the main opposition party just as Lebanon
moves front and center in the Israeli consciousness once again.
Since the invasion, Israeli troops have occupied a 9-mile-deep
security zone in southern Lebanon. But principle campaign pledge of
Barak was to pull them out by next May.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, the vote tally gave Sharon 53 percent of the
ballots cast, to Olmert's 24 percent and Sheetrit's 22 percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Olmert, a former parliament member and cabinet minister, had a
hard time living down what many party faithfuls perceived to have
been a traitorous act on his part. During the national campaign,
while Netanyahu was trying to sell himself as the only candidate
who could save a united Jerusalem, Olmert, a political rival of
Netanyahu, vouched for Barak's security credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Olmert's comments that ``Ehud Barak will not divide Jerusalem''
were used in Barak's television advertising. That image planted
itself in Likud Party members' heads; even a well-financed campaign
and a last-minute endorsement by former Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir failed to help Omert.
</P>
<P>
   Sheetrit, who, like many of the party's members is a Sephardic
Jew, offered himself up as the only candidate who cared about
social issues. Using Israeli code, he was playing the ethnic card,
but without success.
</P>
<P>
   When Sharon's son Omri inadvertently touched on ethnic issues
during the campaign, offending the party's working-class
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Omri Sharon and the Likud's director general, Uri Shani, said
during an interview with a leading newspaper columnist that
Sharon's government-issued Cadillac kept breaking down. But Sharon
was not planning to replace it, they said, because ``it makes a
huge impression on the Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Sharon, the damage did not last.
</P>
<P>
   It was barely apparent here Thursday that voting was taking
place, although 323 polls were open across the country. The apathy
within the party _ 33 percent of its 143,000 registered members
voted, which by Israeli standards is low _ was echoed in a
nationwide indifference to the leadership battle inside the
country's second-largest party. The primaries were barely mentioned
in the news.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, nostalgia for Netanyahu, whose charisma
earned him almost cult status among some Likudniks, grew during the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Even in his absence, he dominated this election campaign. Some
prominent right-wingers supported Olmert, who is more dovish than
Sharon, because they feared the return of the former prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Now it remains to be seen whether Sharon can rebuild the Likud
Party without the former prime minister's active participation. But
just as Netanyahu, in his absence, dominated this campaign, his
influence on the Likud Party is bound to persist.

TO EASE TENSIONS, NYC PLANS SMALLER POLICE PRESENCE AT
CONTROVERSIAL RALLY
</HEADLINE>
 
(ADDS to add 8 grafs at end) (bl) 
By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Police Commissioner Howard Safir on Thursday
reassured anxious neighborhood leaders in Harlem that there would
be a substantially reduced police presence at this year's Million
Youth March.
</P>
<P>
   His pledge marked a retreat from the city's hard-edged stance
toward the organizers of the youth rally, particularly Khallid
Abdul Muhammad, whom Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has accused of
fomenting bigotry and violence by disparaging Jews and whites.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said the police presence would be reduced to comply with
both the desires of neighborhood leaders and the orders of two
courts, which ruled this week that the rally can go forward. Prior
to those court orders, Giuliani and other city officials had
pledged to use the full force of the Police Department to oversee
the event, which last year ended in violent clashes between police
and hundreds of rally participants.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood leaders, while condemning the rally as the
handiwork of anti-Semitic ``outsiders,'' said Thursday that they
were even more afraid that police would repeat the ``heavy-handed''
and ``insulting'' enforcement of last year's march. The enforcement
included squads of officers in riot gear, still more on horses and
in helicopters, and hundreds of barricades that severely restricted
the demonstrators' freedom of movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want community-friendly policing in which we are not
treated as the hostile enemy,'' said City Councilman Bill Perkins,
who last week said he had been assaulted by rally organizers and is
one of several Harlem politicians who have called upon residents to
boycott the march, scheduled to take place from noon to 4 p.m.
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel of Harlem, who had also called for a
boycott, said, ``We don't want to get hit on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with Perkins and other neighborhood leaders Thursday
morning at the Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building in
Harlem, Safir said that the event would be patrolled by fewer than
half the 3,000 or so officers who were assigned to last year's
Million Youth March. Safir also said that the officers would not
wear riot gear, nor would platoons of mounted officers be sent to
the rally area, on Malcolm X Boulevard between 118th and 124th
Streets.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Safir told the group, subway service to Harlem
would not be cut off as it was last year, and police helicopters
would not swoop over the rally, a tactic that provoked intense
criticism from many quarters.
</P>
<P>
   On another sore point, Safir said that a minimal number of
barricades would be used for crowd control, according to those who
were at the meeting. At last year's event, those who attended the
rally were directed into large barricade pens _ ``cattle chutes,''
they were called _ and some residents complained that they were
completely cut off from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, Perkins said, Safir offered assurances that
police officers would not rush the rally stage at the end of the
event, as they did within a minute or two of last year's
agreed-upon ending time. ``They made it clear,'' Perkins said of
Safir and his aides, ``that they would not bum rush the parade the
way they did last time around.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters, Safir said of the meeting, ``There was
not great support for this march, but there was concern that both
sides act reasonably. We intend to act reasonably. We intend to
have adequate police presence up there to make sure this is a safe
event. We would ask that Khallid Muhammad and his people do the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the city has been under considerable legal
pressure to come up with a more subdued police response to the
Million Youth March.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Judge Denny Chin of United States District Court in
Manhattan concluded his 31-page decision allowing the rally to
proceed by observing that, ``Excessive numbers of police officers
in riot gear, rigid enforcement of deadlines, and helicopters
swooping over the crowd can only increase, rather than lessen,
tensions.'' And in upholding Chin's decision the following day, a
panel of three federal appeals court judges _ Dennis Jacobs, Jon
Newman and Richard Cardomone _ also ordered the Police Department
to monitor the event ``without undue rigidity.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite these admonitions, many leaders in Harlem had remained
concerned about the possibility of violence, in part because of
Giuliani's dismissive responses to the rulings. He said the judges
were naive and illogical, and he suggested that their decisions had
placed the Police Department and the city itself in danger.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani tempered his criticism Thursday. ``There are times
when you disagree with a court's decision,'' he said, ``but my oath
of office is to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the United
States. If the court has decided it, we will respect it and we will
carry out the letter and the spirit of what the court decided.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Harlem, the city's new moderation was welcomed. Several
business leaders made the point Thursday that Muhammad had only
gained in stature, especially among young people, with each
escalation in his war of words with Giuliani, who is viewed with
suspicion by many blacks. A better approach, they said, was to
simply deprive Muhammad of attention and support _ in effect to
``marginalize'' him so that the march comes and goes with barely a
ripple.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask them to leave our community as they find it,'' said
Walter Edwards, a developer and head of the Harlem Business
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   City officials seemed to embrace this strategy Thursday,
portraying the decision to cut back on police as an inevitable
response to last year's low turnout. Last year, police officials
estimated the crowd size at 6,000; march organizers have offered
varying estimates, from 50,000 to 150,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, quite honestly, that we gave Khallid too much credit
last year for attracting more people,'' Safir said. ``Because we
had no experience with him, we thought he would attract many more
people. He attracted fewer, and we expect him to attract fewer this
year.''

HAWAII TRIP WILL BE NO USC HOLIDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU _ Dr. John Hubbard remembers the last time USC played
here, and his bittersweet memories persuaded him to stay home 21
years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first and last time I'll go there (for a game),''
said Hubbard, USC's school president from 1970-80.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans defeated the Rainbow Warriors 21-5 in 1978 and
then-president Hubbard's antics were probably the most memorable
moment of a contest that gave the Trojans a scare en route to the
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, USC received a 15-yard ``non-contact
foul'' that negated a Trojans fumble recovery, when Hubbard
insulted a local official.
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett was an assistant on the sideline that
December night, and still remembers Hubbard's infraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were mystified on that penalty,'' Hackett said. ``I
couldn't see anybody. (Hubbard) had gone behind the bench. We
didn't find out who it was until after the game.''
</P>
<P>
   A sheepish Hubbard can still recall Hackett's reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was as astonished as John Robinson was,'' Hubbard said.
``He couldn't figure out where that flag came from.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett has been assured that a Western Athletic Conference crew
of officials will work Saturday's game against Hawaii at Aloha
Stadium, but there are other pitfalls he's trying to avoid for what
is supposed to be a trip to paradise.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans are doing their version of an island commando raid,
swooping into Honolulu on Thursday, barely 60 hours before kickoff.
Hackett doesn't want the Trojans to experience too much ``Aloha
Spirit'' before the game.
</P>
<P>
   It's a direct consequence of last year's embarrassing Sun Bowl
defeat to Texas Christian, when Hackett felt too many things
happened off the field to distract the players during their week in
El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't have to say much. Because of El Paso, they
understand the magnitude of not preparing and the consequences,''
Hackett said. ``We will be very serious about this game.''
</P>
<P>
   No one will doubt that. There's USC's spartan itinerary, for
example, which includes a trip to Pearl Harbor and little else. A
trip to the Polynesian Cultural Center was scratched because of
time constraints _ and the Sun Bowl defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Even the players admit the trip to El Paso has influenced their
feelings about coming to Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before El Paso, it would be a distraction, now it's just
another game,'' linebacker Zeke Moreno said. ``Honestly, before
that, I would say it would be a big distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's going to be hard not to do anything. I mean,
everywhere we go, even just driving to practice, we'll be taking a
scenic route. You can't ignore that. But I've been to Hawaii
already, so it doesn't matter that much to me.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one major difference between 1978 and '99. USC is
beginning this season on the islands, while the '78 team was
concluding its regular season before playing in the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is different playing at the end of the year instead
of the beginning,'' said Paul McDonald, who was the Trojans'
quarterback, although he missed the Hawaii game with an injured
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald remembers in '78 that it was his first visit to Hawaii,
and most of the players underestimated their opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember how sheltered a life I had. I was walking around in
a velour shirt and it was 85 degrees,'' McDonald said. ``I had no
idea it was that hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were tough,'' McDonald said. ``We showed up and they were
hitting us in the mouth. You have to show up and bring it. We
definitely did not do it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's something USC's current players promise will not happen
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is looking to come to Hawaii and take a vacation,''
cornerback Kris Richard said. ``No one's looking at them as a light
foe.''
</P>
<P>
   Just in case things do get tough Saturday night, the Trojans
might want to remember it could be a lot worse. Just ask Hubbard.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, they were notorious about being homers,'' he
said. ``Hawaii and the officials are not noted for their
objectivity. You've got to understand you're not going to get every
call you deserve.''

 &HT;    3 charged with killing teen in Georgia ravine
 &HT;    By Susan Gast
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Ga. _ When 17-year-old Krystal Archer crossed a Morgan
County cow pasture a month ago with her friends, she thought they
were out to gather mushrooms to make hallucinogenic tea.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Archer was tortured for days and killed _ supposedly in
an act of jealousy, authorities say. The crime was so horrendous it
has veteran lawmen shaking their heads and the townspeople of
nearby Madison, just 50 miles east of downtown Atlanta, talking
about little else.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is not a death penalty case, I've never seen one,''
said Maj. Michael Pritchett of the Morgan County Sheriff's
Department. Pritchett found Archer's body Tuesday after one of
three people later charged with the slaying told a law enforcement
agency he knew a woman had been killed by someone he knew.
</P>
<P>
   Danielle Hubbard, 18, formerly of Athens, and Michael
Christopher Teal, 19, and Timothy Curtis Cole, 21, both of
Covington, are charged with aggravated assault and felony murder in
Archer's death, Pritchett said.
</P>
<P>
   The young men are being held in the Morgan County Jail; Hubbard
has been sent to Newton County because Morgan County does not have
a facility for women inmates, Pritchett said.
</P>
<P>
   Archer had been dating Cole, and Hubbard was dating Teal,
Pritchett said. The four had visited Madison to eat at a Chinese
restaurant, go to the Wal-Mart and spend the night at a motel, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard had been living with Teal in Covington, although her
family lives in Athens, Pritchett said.
</P>
<P>
   Between July 31 and the first week of August, the friendship
between the foursome changed.
</P>
<P>
   The exact dates that the events occurred are murky because the
suspects said they ``stayed high'' most of the time after the first
day, Pritchett said.
</P>
<P>
   According to statements Hubbard, Teal and Cole made to
investigators, the four young people jumped a fence one afternoon
sometime that week and crossed the field beside Brobston Lane,
south of Interstate 20. They told Archer they were looking for
mushrooms, something some of them had done there before. They
walked into woods 100 yards away. That's where the outing suddenly
turned violent, Pritchett said.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard physically attacked Archer because she thought the girl
``had been eyeing'' Teal, Pritchett said. Teal and Cole joined in
the fray, pushing Archer repeatedly down a 20-foot ravine into a
creek, the officer said. The three suspects spent four hours that
afternoon hitting Archer with rocks and branches, breaking bones
and bruising her, and pushing her back down the bank when she tried
to climb out, Pritchett said. They set her hair on fire, took her
clothes and left her naked, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The three returned the next day, beat her again, piled rocks and
sticks on her, then left her again, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   After days of lying in 6 to 8 inches of creek water, slipping in
and out of consciousness, with an eye so severely injured that she
could barely see, Archer thought help had finally come, Pritchett
said the suspects told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did you find me?'' Pritchett said she asked, as she
crawled toward the people approaching her. But help had not
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the bad guys again,'' Pritchett said.
</P>
<P>
   The officer said Cole admitted that this time he approached
Archer and stabbed her in the back twice as she lay on her stomach.
Then he ``got her by the hair, slit her throat, turned her over and
left her,'' Pritchett said.
</P>
<P>
   By Aug. 4, Archer was reported missing by her father in
Elberton. Juvenile Court authorities investigating her
disappearance talked with the three friends because Archer was
known to have spent time with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if that is what got them to decide they better
come out and say something, or if (Cole's) conscience got to
working on him,'' Pritchett said.
</P>
<P>
   Cole started telling a ``vague'' story about his knowing ``a guy
named Lance'' who had killed someone, Pritchett said. Cole did not
at first admit to involvement in the crime he was reporting.
Finally Cole went to the Madison County Sheriff's Department with
his story. The sheriff there contacted Morgan County authorities
and brought Cole there to lead them to the body Tuesday, Pritchett
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two other suspects were arrested Tuesday night, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The butcher knife used to kill Archer was discovered by Newton
County Sheriff's Department divers in the Yellow River in
Porterdale, 10-15 miles from where her body was found, Pritchett
said. The knife matches a set of knives belonging to Hubbard's
family in Athens, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Divers also recovered ``several'' firearms that Pritchett said
were reported missing earlier by Archer's father in Elberton.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsy results were not complete Thursday, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Michael Gailey said he hopes to
bring the case to the grand jury next week.

ILLEGAL KIDNEY AUCTION POPS UP ON EBAY'S WEB SITE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla.)   (EDS: in last graf, change (POUND SIGN) to the typographical
symbol)

<P>
   Bidding for a human kidney, described on the Internet auction
site Ebay as ``fully functional,'' began at $25,000 and reached
$5,750,100 before the company abruptly ended the auction Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In the pantheon of bizarre items that Internet users offer for
sale on Ebay _ host to about 2.6 million auctions a day _ human
organs are forbidden. To buy or sell them is a felony under federal
law, and trading in illegal goods is a violation of Ebay's rules.
</P>
<P>
   It seems likely that the auction was a joke. But whether or not
the offer was real, the incident underscores the ease with which
the Internet enables transactions of any kind, regardless of social
custom or law.
</P>
<P>
   ``A market is just a buyer and a seller and the thing they're
transacting, and the Internet allows anyone to meet up with
anyone,'' said Kevin Werbach, managing editor of the technology
industry newsletter Release 1.0. ``If you could get something
through a normal channel and there was sufficient supply, you
probably wouldn't go to Ebay.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Westly, Ebay's vice president for marketing and business
development, said Thursday that the company was working with
law-enforcement officials to insure that no illegal transactions
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ebay has zero tolerance for illegal items on the site,''
Westly said. ``We do not know whether this was a prank or real, but
what people should know is we treat this very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, after users had posted auctions for a
missile, a rocket launcher and other military weapons, whose sale
among civilians is generally illegal, Ebay, based in San Jose,
Calif., banned the sale of guns and ammunition on the site. The
company has no automatic screening mechanism for items that it
deems unacceptable, relying on users and its customer service staff
to flag violations.
</P>
<P>
   The kidney seller, identified as ``hchero'' of Sunrise, Fla.,
put a $25,000 floor on the bidding when he made his offer, on
Thursday of last week. ``You can choose either kidney,'' he wrote
in his description. ``Buyer pays all transplant and medical costs.
Of course only one for sale, as I need the other one to live.
Serious bids only.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Organ Transplant Act, enacted in 1984, makes the
sale or purchase of human organs punishable by up to five years in
prison or a $50,000 fine. And while the Internet can bring together
invisible buyers and sellers in the ether, the actual transplant of
an organ requires a real-world hospital and corporeal surgeons. So
bioethicists were not very concerned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do an organ transplant on the sly,'' said Henry
Greely, a law professor at Stanford University who specializes in
bioethics. ``You need a host of professional intermediaries before
this could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, if such a sale took place through an Internet site not
based in the United States, it might raise jurisdictional
questions, Greely added.
</P>
<P>
   Ebay removed the record of the kidney bidding from its public
database Thursday afternoon, but a search for ``kidney'' still
retrieved the listing for (POUND SIGN)153213066: ``Kidney _ Fully
functional kidney for sale.''

 (Eds: SUBS thruout to include many additional details, including
the bidding process, the names of the sellers and the adjustable
interest rate.) THE CLINTONS SETTLE ON ANOTHER WHITE HOUSE  
(ART ADV: A photo is being sent. Non-subscribers can make
individual purchase by calling 888-603-1036 or 888-346-9867.)  By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKANEATELES, N.Y. _ President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton
on Thursday settled the question of where the first family will
live once their lease on the White House expires, signing a
contract to purchase a a $1.7 million, 11-room Dutch Colonial home
set in the wooded suburbs of Westchester County, north of New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of a home in New York removes one of the chief
obstacles in Mrs. Clinton's path as she prepares for a run for the
U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons, indebted by over $5 million in legal bills that
have accumulated because of the legal inquires that have marked the
Clinton presidency, were able to purchase the five-bedroom home in
Chappaqua after Clinton's chief fund-raiser, Terry McAuliffe,
personally secured the loan.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said that McAuliffe had put up $1.35 million of
his own money with Bankers Trust. Under the terms of the mortgage,
McAuliffe will receive the money back, with interest, once the
Clintons either pay back the mortgage or, as is more likely,
refinance it in five years.
</P>
<P>
   The interest rate on the loan is to be determined at closing,
which is set for Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution of where the Clintons would live was announced in
a three-paragraph statement issued by the temporary Press Office of
the White House _ a room in the Holiday Inn in Auburn, about seven
miles from the Clintons are vacationing.
</P>
<P>
   It apparently concludes what has certainly been one of the more
unusual house-hunting expeditions embarked on by any American
family, complicated by the Clintons' station in life, the fact that
they have now owned a home in 16 years, and Mrs. Clinton's
political ambitions in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased about the house,'' Mrs. Clinton said as she
left a fund-raiser for her presumed Senate campaign Thursday
evening in Cazenovia and headed to another one in Syracuse. ``It's
beautiful. We like it a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, emerging from the Syracuse fund-raiser, Mrs. Clinton
declared to cheers: ``As of today, Bill Clinton and I are the
newest homeowners in the state of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' she added, ``we're so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The choice of a house came after the Clintons, trailed by a
presidential-size entourage of assistants, Secret Service agents
and reporters, toured homes in New Rochelle, Greenberg, Purchase,
Mamaroneck and Pound Ridge, all in Westchester County. They spent
two hours in the Chappaqua house last Saturday; Mrs. Clinton had
seen the home before, an aide said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything about this was normal _ except that they are the
first family,'' said Kathy Sloane, a broker with Brown Harris
Stevens in Manhattan, who guided the Clintons through the process.
</P>
<P>
   The house was shown to the public for only three days. After
that, Dr. Jeffrey Weisberg and his wife Cheryl, who have owned the
home for just over 18 years, invited closed bids on the house. The
bids were opened at 3 p.m. on Sunday, and the Clintons were
informed shortly thereafter that the Weisbergs were prepared to
sell to them, according to family associates.
</P>
<P>
   Eight bids were submitted on the house, according to family
associates. It was unclear last night whether the Clintons, who
offered just over the $1.675 million asking price, had made the
highest bid.
</P>
<P>
   There was a clear sense of relief Thursday among Mrs. Clinton's
political advisers, who are concerned that charges of carpetbagging
could hurt the first lady, since she has never lived in New York.
Her likely Republican opponent, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, traveled to
Arkansas to underscore the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has begun to visit New York regularly, but her
trips have been marked by images that have made her campaign
advisers wince _ of her either leaving to return to Washington, or
spending the night as a guest of friends and supporters.
Accordingly, the first lady's advisers have been pressing her to
settle on a house as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The closing date is Nov. 1. Mrs. Clinton's aides said the first
lady would begin spending a good amount of time there as soon as
possible after that. (One complication of the Clintons' nomadic
ways is that they don't have enough of their own furniture to fill
a house, particularly one this size, a friend of the family said.)
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said that for the
remainder of Clinton's term, the president and Mrs. Clinton
intended to treat their Chappaqua home much the way other First
Families have treated their own private residences. ``The Clintons
will continue to live in the White House,'' Lockhart said in a
telephone interview from Washington. ``As with other presidents,
this house will be their private home and they will spend as much
time there as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   New York elections tend to be decided in the suburbs, which Mrs.
Clinton will now call home. But Mrs. Clinton's aides said that
while political considerations entered the Clintons' deliberations,
they were not predominant. That said, the Clintons clearly avoided
communities like Scarsdale and Bedford, which are well-known across
New York as among the state's wealthiest suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Chappaqua, if not quite as well-known as Scarsdale, is
known as one of the more exclusive, and upper-middle-class, bedroom
communities of Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, the Clintons will put down $350,000
on the $1.7 million house, drawn from their blind trust, Lockhart
said. That represents a down payment of about 20 percent. The
remaining financing comes in the form of a securities-backed
mortgage from Bankers Trust for $1.35 million.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the collateral on the loan is $1.35 million put up
by McAuliffe. Thus, this transaction seems to assure McAuliffe, who
is already one of the president's closest friends and supporters, a
significant role in Clintons' financial life after he leaves
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe has a reputation Washington as a singularly effective
fund-raiser, and he is largely credited with the fund-raising
successes of both Clinton and the Democratic Party during Clinton's
years in office. The fact that the president and Mrs. Clinton
turned to him now is hardly a surprise: McAuliffe is already
serving as the key fund-raiser for Mrs. Clinton's presumed Senate
race, the president's legal defense fund, and a $10 million
millennium celebration the Clintons are planning for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe did not return a page last night.
</P>
<P>
   The secured-mortgage arrangement was described by other real
estate brokers last night as slightly unusual, but not unheard of.
Most of all, it seemed a reflection of the Clintons' financial
bind: Notwithstanding the obvious earning potential of an
ex-president, White House aides said the family had assets of just
over $1 million and legal debts of about $5.2 million. As a result,
one of the president's associates said, banks were a little bit
wary about providing such a large a mortgage without some extra
security.
</P>
<P>
   This loan is a five-year balloon mortgage, which means that the
Clintons will have to refinance (or pay back the entire amount) in
five years. It is an adjustable rate that can change every six
months, and will equal one point above the London Interbank Offered
Rate, which is the rate that the most credit-worthy international
banks charge each other for large loans.
</P>
<P>
   The current rate is 5.52 percent. Based on this, the Clintons
would pay an interest rate of 6.52 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said that the White House counsel's office had ruled
that McAuliffe's guarantee did not fall under the provisions of
federal gift reporting laws and thus did not have to be listed on
the Clintons' annual disclosure report.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kennedy, a spokesman for the White House counsel's office,
said he could not comment on whether that would change if the
Clintons defaulted on the loan, and McAuliffe lost his money.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a hypothetical question, and I don't have an answer to
that,'' he said.

RANGERS' ZIMMERMAN RATTLED, AND TIGERS ROLL IN 8TH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Right-hander Jeff Zimmerman lost his composure.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not all the Rangers' All-Star middle reliever would
lose during yesterday's decisive eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman lost two fly balls to Tiger Stadium's matinee audience
and the ballgame after] shortstop Deivi Cruz crushed an 0-2 slider
for a game-winning, two-run home run during Detroit's 8-7 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed in what happened,'' said Zimmerman, who
inherited a three-run, eighth-inning lead. ``I didn't get the job
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The meltdown's origin could be traced to Detroit's first at-bat
of the inning. Designated hitter Bobby Higginson launched the
second of his two solo home runs on a 2-2 fastball intended to jam
the left-handed batter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that \Rticked\S me off,'' Zimmerman said. ``I got
pretty angry at myself. I knew how I wanted to pitch him and made a
mistake. I got mad at myself, and I didn't get over it right away.
It affected the rest of my outing.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman flogged himself for what could have been a meaningless
home run and that set up an afternoon ``hard to describe,'' Rangers
manager Johnny Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers continued their rally with an ensuing double by Juan
Encarnacion, who coasted into second base after Rangers right
fielder Juan Gonzalez lost the fly ball in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Encarnacion eventually scored on a one-out single by catcher
Bill Haselman, and that brought yesterday's hero to the plate. Cruz
dug himself into an 0-2 count, and Zimmerman's attempt to throw one
of his usually devastating sliders backfired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to strike him out,'' Zimmerman said. ``I figured I
needed the strikeout. I wanted to snap it off and put it in the
dirt and get him to swing at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The scorecard will show that Zimmerman went 1-for-3 in the
goal-setting department.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great learning experience,'' Zimmerman said.
``That's usually the case when you get \Rit\S handed to you.''
</P>
<P>
   So, the Rangers went in search of a game-tying run during the
ninth inning despite home runs from Royce Clayton, Rusty Greer,
Rafael Palmeiro and Todd Zeile earlier in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton set the table with a leadoff double and advanced to
third on a sacrifice bunt by Tom Goodwin. Yet, the Rangers failed
to score the runner from third with less than two outs. Detroit
closer Todd Jones recorded his 22nd save by retiring Mark McLemore
and Ivan Rodriguez with three-pitch strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   That signaled the end of a strange, strange afternoon in the
Rangers' final game at historic Tiger Stadium that produced:
</P>
<P>
   the fly ball Gonzalez lost in the sun;
</P>
<P>
   a seventh-inning fly ball that dropped between Greer and Goodwin
because of a miscommunication;
</P>
<P>
   a fourth-inning double by Encarnacion that scored Damion Easley
from first base despite Greer's claim that a spectator interfered
with a ball in play. Interference would have resulted in a
ground-rule double and prevented Easley from crossing the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like the ``Twilight Zone'' out there,'' Oates said.
``It was just a weird day.''
</P>
<P>
   Scoring on Zimmerman, though, continues to happen with
increasing frequency. Zimmerman has been scored upon during six of
his past 14 appearances and has a 6.15 earned-run average for that
period.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 27-year-old rookie must show he can adjust to the
adjustments made by American League hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even Randy Johnson has to change the way he pitches
sometimes,'' Oates said.

TEXAS RANGERS ASK WHY SO MANY SEATS EMPTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rangers president Jim Lites was talking
yesterday about his marketing Doberman, Jeff Cogen. He's the guy
who is paid for his butts-in-seats expertise at baseball and hockey
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how Cogen is,'' Lites said. ``Every empty seat is a
personal insult. An empty seat is his enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Give it a month, when the Stars begin another Stanley Cup
crusade, and Cogen will have nothing but ``friends'' at Reunion
Arena. All 41 home games are expected to sell out.
</P>
<P>
   But in the baseball half of Tom Hicks' sports empire, for which
Lites and Cogen pull double duty, life is not that comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the most recent Rangers' homestand against top draws
Boston and the Yankees, Cogen had some 48,000 enemies to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   The average attendance for those six games was 37,000-plus, and
only one crowd reached a 46,000 capacity at The Ballpark in
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not bad, but I can't say we weren't disappointed,''
Lites said.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Lites was disappointed, and he was hardly alone. The best
marketing strategy in sports is a winning product on the field, the
court or the ice. Since the All-Star break in mid-July, no Rangers
team in 28 years has played better, even with the disaster in
Detroit this week. And the Yankees are the best road draw in the
game, with the Red Sox in the top five also.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I don't want to do is overreact, particularly not having
gone through a full season yet,'' Lites said. ``But we are doing
the most comprehensive surveys and studies that are available. We
want to find out what our fans think.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been well over a decade, going back to old Arlington
Stadium, since attendance ``problems'' have been mentioned in
conjunction with the Rangers. The overall fan base has always been
solid. Now, however, some concern is obvious.
</P>
<P>
   As a holiday weekend homestand opens tonight against the White
Sox, to be followed by the Indians, the gate is down 88,000 from a
year ago. But that's easily explained. In the prime attendance
month of June, the Rangers had only eight home games. The average
is usually 13 to 15.
</P>
<P>
   But with 17 August home games, when the team was on a tear, the
crowds averaged just over 32,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do want to find out why,'' Lites said.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of reasons are available _ the heat wave of August;
raising ticket prices for three consecutive seasons left the paying
customers feeling gouged; the Cowboys and the Stars have won four
world championships in the '90s and the fans now wait for the
Rangers to show their postseason worth.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the dumbest theory of all _ that the ballpark
should have been built in downtown Dallas. Hicks is going through
political hell over a downtown sports arena that barely passed at
the polls, and this was with a hotel-rental car tax. Financing a
ballpark in Dallas through a sales tax, as Arlington did, is
laughable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'd want to wager on that,'' deadpanned Lites,
who has been involved in the political wars for the downtown arena
since Day One.
</P>
<P>
   But have baseball ticket prices turned off the fans? A Tom Hicks
says no _ sorta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our surveys don't show that,'' the owner said. ``But this is a
partnership with the fans. In pricing tickets, you have to have the
right balance of what is right for us and what is right for the
fans. At the moment, it might not be in balance.''
</P>
<P>
   For next season, Lites promised a reduction in ticket prices,
but ...
</P>
<P>
   He also didn't promise that some seats wouldn't be raised even
higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at our seating, wanting to know where people
don't buy,'' Lites said. ``In certain areas of the park, prices
will be down \Rnext season\S. But where there's heavy demand, do we
raise those prices? I don't know yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a team that's going to have an $80 million to $90
million payroll. The fans want a competitive club. To achieve that
in baseball, tickets can't be cheap. But what's fair?''
</P>
<P>
   Without question, the Rangers lag miles behind a Cleveland or a
Baltimore in season-ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're under 12,000 for full-season \Rsales\S,'' Lites said.
``As of right now, the Stars will sell more full-season tickets
than the Rangers. Our most aggressive campaign of all will be in
season tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   But the shortage there leads to one of the large positives for
the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Lites said: ``I strongly believe the Rangers sell more
individual tickets \Rper game\S than any team in baseball. Or any
team in professional sports, for that matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Business is good. But more friends are needed.

 &HT;    Bradley tries to distinguish himself from Gore in Ohio
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley brought his
presidential campaign to Ohio on Thursday to advocate for campaign
finance reform and gun control, pick up an endorsement and raise
the dollars he needs to compete with Vice President Al Gore for the
Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ohio is a very important state in the presidential election
this year . . . I will be back to Ohio often in the coming
months,'' Bradley said at Port Columbus airport.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said, however, that he expects the vice president, who
has been coming to Ohio for presidential campaigns since 1988, to
pick up more endorsements from officeholders.
</P>
<P>
   The former New Jersey senator and New York Knicks' basketball
star began his Buckeye swing in Cleveland, where he picked up the
endorsement of Cuyahoga County Commissioner Tim McCormack.
</P>
<P>
   While there, Bradley told the Associated Press that
taxpayer-funded vouchers won't solve the problem of poor quality
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think school vouchers are the answer to the problems
of public education,'' he said. A state-funded voucher program is
the subject of a court debate in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said such programs have problems, ``not the least of
which are issues of church and state,'' that must be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he voted twice for federally funded experimental
voucher programs. Neither bill became law.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Bradley, 56, was to attend a fund-raiser at the
home of Columbus attorney Harrison Smith. Those attending were
asked to contribute $1,000 each but Bob McAlister, an attorney and
Democratic party activist who helped coordinate the event, said he
did not know how many would be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been pleased to this point,'' said McAlister.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he differs from Gore on major issues, Bradley said he
has taken a tougher stand on gun control. He advocates registration
and licensing of all handguns, banning gun dealers from selling
weapons in residential neighborhoods and outlawing the manufacture,
sale, distribution and possession of cheap handguns known as
``Saturday Night Specials.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a position I had long before Columbine,'' he said,
referring to the April 20 incident at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., where two students killed 13 people and then
themselves in a shooting rampage.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also said that his proposals for campaign finance reform
go further than the vice president's.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Ruvolo, former Ohio Democratic chairman who's helping
coordinate Gore's Ohio campaign, said that Gore is ``not soft on
guns'' and, like Bradley, has called for banning ``soft money'' _
unregulated and unlimited contributions to political parties _ but
only if Republicans go along.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not going to unilaterally disarm,'' Ruvolo said of
Gore and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   McAlister said that Bradley's ``winnability'' will help him
overcome Gore in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need a kind of restoration of the presidency. I
just don't see that happening with a continuation of this (Clinton)
administration,'' said McAlister.
</P>
<P>
   Ruvolo, who stressed that he is not an official spokesman for
the Gore campaign, said that a ``vigorous'' campaign before the
March 7 primary will be good for Democrats because it will stir
interest in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both good people,'' said Ruvolo.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKANEATELES, N.Y. _ President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton
on Thursday settled the question of where the first family will
live once their lease on the White House expires, signing a
contract to purchase a a $1.7 million, 11-room Dutch Colonial home
set in the wooded suburbs of Westchester County, north of New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of a home in New York removes one of the chief
obstacles in Mrs. Clinton's path as she prepares for a run for the
U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons, indebted by over $5 million in legal bills that
have accumulated because of the legal inquires that have marked the
Clinton presidency, were able to purchase the five-bedroom home in
Chappaqua after Clinton's chief fund-raiser, Terry McAuliffe,
personally secured the loan.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said that McAuliffe had put up $1.35 million of
his own money with Bankers Trust. Under the terms of the mortgage,
McAuliffe will receive the money back, with interest, once the
Clintons either pay back the mortgage or, as is more likely,
refinance it in five years.
</P>
<P>
   The interest rate on the loan is to be determined at closing,
which is set for Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution of where the Clintons would live was announced in
a three-paragraph statement issued by the temporary Press Office of
the White House _ a room in the Holiday Inn in Auburn, about seven
miles from the Clintons are vacationing.
</P>
<P>
   It apparently concludes what has certainly been one of the more
unusual house-hunting expeditions embarked on by any American
family, complicated by the Clintons' station in life, the fact that
they have not owned a home in 16 years, and Mrs. Clinton's
political ambitions in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased about the house,'' Mrs. Clinton said as she
left a fund-raiser for her presumed Senate campaign Thursday
evening in Cazenovia and headed to another one in Syracuse. ``It's
beautiful. We like it a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, emerging from the Syracuse fund-raiser, Mrs. Clinton
declared to cheers: ``As of today, Bill Clinton and I are the
newest homeowners in the state of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' she added, ``we're so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The choice of a house came after the Clintons, trailed by a
presidential-size entourage of assistants, Secret Service agents
and reporters, toured homes in New Rochelle, Greenberg, Purchase,
Mamaroneck and Pound Ridge, all in Westchester County. They spent
two hours in the Chappaqua house last Saturday; Mrs. Clinton had
seen the home before, an aide said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything about this was normal _ except that they are the
first family,'' said Kathy Sloane, a broker with Brown Harris
Stevens in Manhattan, who guided the Clintons through the process.
</P>
<P>
   The house was shown to the public for only three days. After
that, Dr. Jeffrey Weisberg and his wife Cheryl, who have owned the
home for just over 18 years, invited closed bids on the house. The
bids were opened at 3 p.m. on Sunday, and the Clintons were
informed shortly thereafter that the Weisbergs were prepared to
sell to them, according to family associates.
</P>
<P>
   Eight bids were submitted on the house, according to family
associates. It was unclear last night whether the Clintons, who
offered just over the $1.675 million asking price, had made the
highest bid.
</P>
<P>
   There was a clear sense of relief Thursday among Mrs. Clinton's
political advisers, who are concerned that charges of carpetbagging
could hurt the first lady, since she has never lived in New York.
Her likely Republican opponent, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, traveled to
Arkansas to underscore the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has begun to visit New York regularly, but her
trips have been marked by images that have made her campaign
advisers wince _ of her either leaving to return to Washington, or
spending the night as a guest of friends and supporters.
Accordingly, the first lady's advisers have been pressing her to
settle on a house as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The closing date is Nov. 1. Mrs. Clinton's aides said the first
lady would begin spending a good amount of time there as soon as
possible after that. (One complication of the Clintons' nomadic
ways is that they don't have enough of their own furniture to fill
a house, particularly one this size, a friend of the family said.)
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said that for the
remainder of Clinton's term, the president and Mrs. Clinton
intended to treat their Chappaqua home much the way other First
Families have treated their own private residences. ``The Clintons
will continue to live in the White House,'' Lockhart said in a
telephone interview from Washington. ``As with other presidents,
this house will be their private home and they will spend as much
time there as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   New York elections tend to be decided in the suburbs, which Mrs.
Clinton will now call home. But Mrs. Clinton's aides said that
while political considerations entered the Clintons' deliberations,
they were not predominant. That said, the Clintons clearly avoided
communities like Scarsdale and Bedford, which are well-known across
New York as among the state's wealthiest suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Chappaqua, if not quite as well-known as Scarsdale, is
known as one of the more exclusive, and upper-middle-class, bedroom
communities of Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, the Clintons will put down $350,000
on the $1.7 million house, drawn from their blind trust, Lockhart
said. That represents a down payment of about 20 percent. The
remaining financing comes in the form of a securities-backed
mortgage from Bankers Trust for $1.35 million.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the collateral on the loan is $1.35 million put up
by McAuliffe. Thus, this transaction seems to assure McAuliffe, who
is already one of the president's closest friends and supporters, a
significant role in Clintons' financial life after he leaves
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe has a reputation Washington as a singularly effective
fund-raiser, and he is largely credited with the fund-raising
successes of both Clinton and the Democratic Party during Clinton's
years in office. The fact that the president and Mrs. Clinton
turned to him now is hardly a surprise: McAuliffe is already
serving as the key fund-raiser for Mrs. Clinton's presumed Senate
race, the president's legal defense fund, and a $10 million
millennium celebration the Clintons are planning for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe did not return a page last night.
</P>
<P>
   The secured-mortgage arrangement was described by other real
estate brokers last night as slightly unusual, but not unheard of.
Most of all, it seemed a reflection of the Clintons' financial
bind: Notwithstanding the obvious earning potential of an
ex-president, White House aides said the family had assets of just
over $1 million and legal debts of about $5.2 million. As a result,
one of the president's associates said, banks were a little bit
wary about providing such a large a mortgage without some extra
security.
</P>
<P>
   This loan is a five-year balloon mortgage, which means that the
Clintons will have to refinance (or pay back the entire amount) in
five years. It is an adjustable rate that can change every six
months, and will equal one point above the London Interbank Offered
Rate, which is the rate that the most credit-worthy international
banks charge each other for large loans.
</P>
<P>
   The current rate is 5.52 percent. Based on this, the Clintons
would pay an interest rate of 6.52 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said that the White House counsel's office had ruled
that McAuliffe's guarantee did not fall under the provisions of
federal gift reporting laws and thus did not have to be listed on
the Clintons' annual disclosure report.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kennedy, a spokesman for the White House counsel's office,
said he could not comment on whether that would change if the
Clintons defaulted on the loan, and McAuliffe lost his money.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a hypothetical question, and I don't have an answer to
that,'' he said.

ARKANSAS RAZORBACKS CARRY MEMORY OF LATE TEAMMATE WITH THEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The shoulder pads still sit on top of the locker, as if waiting
for Brandon Burlsworth to walk in, yank them down, and strap them
on one more time.
</P>
<P>
   The game uniform and distinctive red helmet hang inside the
locker, as they did during the four years Burlsworth spent molding
himself into a star at the University of Arkansas. Several pairs of
shoes are arranged neatly on the top shelf, along with the big
guard's trademark dark glasses.
</P>
<P>
   But although it sits in the middle of the Razorbacks' dressing
room, the locker _ now encased in glass _ is no longer functional.
It is a shrine ... a memorial to a lost teammate. The shoulder pads
will never move again, and Burlsworth is gone ... forever.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as Arkansas prepares to open the 1999 season against
SMU on Saturday night in the Cotton Bowl, it is almost as if
Burlsworth _ who died in a car crash 11 days after being drafted by
Indianapolis in April _ is as important to the Razorbacks in spirit
as he once was anchoring the offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a feeling that a lot of what this team
accomplished last year came through Burls,'' said quarterback Clint
Stoerner, ``and that now, he is still a part of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened was ... an unbelievable tragedy, but his memory
is still alive. I think Burls will be a part of Arkansas football
from now on. I don't think this school will ever forget him, and
that's fine with me.''
</P>
<P>
   The season has not been officially dedicated to Burlsworth, but
the ``Doing It The Burls' Way'' T-shirts worn by the team proved to
be the most visibly arresting sight during two-a-days. Arkansas has
retired only one jersey _ Clyde Scott's _ in its history, but
Burlsworth's No. 77 will be honored during homecoming ceremonies
this year.
</P>
<P>
   There is a feeling among many that he was the best Arkansas ever
had. Not the best player _ in spite of his All-Southeastern
Conference and All-America credentials and the conviction of the
Colts that he could start in the NFL as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Just the best, period. And it was that quality that added to the
shock of his death.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up nearby to Fayetteville in Harrison, Ark., the child
of a broken marriage, he eventually reconciled with his father
while remaining devoted to his mother, Barbara. Together, they
bought him a car when he graduated from high school.
</P>
<P>
   He also developed a deep love for the Razorbacks, but when
Arkansas coaches first saw him, he was 6 feet tall and weighed only
200 pounds. Although he subsequently grew three inches, he was told
he needed to be a lot heavier to play at that level.
</P>
<P>
   The next time they saw him, as a walk-on nine months later, he
weighed 308 pounds. He finished his career at Arkansas with a
scholarship, two academic degrees, a 3.4 grade-point average, and
34 consecutive starts in the offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, he never spent one day of that time behaving
like a star. Next to a question in the media guide, ``If you could
spend a day anywhere in the world, where would you go?'' he wrote,
``Harrison, because it's a nice town.'' He frequently drove back to
spend a night at home and go to church with his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just seemed almost too good to be true,'' said Arkansas
coach Houston Nutt. ``He wasn't a talker, but he was the kind of
person that the others looked up to and followed _ probably because
they had never known anyone like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't drink, he didn't smoke, he never said a foul word
... he was totally unselfish. He had a work ethic that was just
unbelievable. He was always the first one out and the last one in.
He put in extra practice on his own. He did every drill, even if he
was sick or hurting. If you told him to do five sprints, he did
seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``With him, it was total dedication, total commitment. He came
here five years ago as a walk-on, became an All-American, and
earned his regular degree \Rmarketing management\S and a master's
\Rbusiness administration\S. But the biggest thing about him was,
he was just such a great person.''
</P>
<P>
   For Nutt, the Burlsworth memory that will stick with him from a
spectacular turnaround season (from 4-7 to 9-3) came in the team's
darkest moment _ when quarterback Clint Stoerner's late fumble
allowed Tennessee to escape almost certain defeat and salvage a
victory in a showdown of unbeatens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clint handled it well, standing there answering question after
question from the media during the postgame,'' Nutt said. ``But
after a few minutes, Burls stepped in and explained to everyone
that he had actually caused the fumble, because Clint stumbled over
his foot after taking the snap.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the truth, but the thing that impressed me was that
Burls wasn't going to stand there and let a teammate get crucified
alone. That's just the way he was.''
</P>
<P>
   For senior guard Jeremiah Washburn, it remains painful to
remember the way Burlsworth was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't cry for a month,'' he said. ``I just stayed in
denial; I couldn't believe it. Every day, I kept expecting him to
walk through the door, to prove that it wasn't true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never experienced this before. At our age, you sometimes
have to deal with the death of a loved one, but it's always someone
who's much older. This is the first time I've lost someone this
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me a long time to accept the truth and break down. I
miss my friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess with everything that's been said and written about
him, people may have the idea that he was some kind of uptight `Mr.
Perfect' guy, but he wasn't that way at all _ he just didn't make a
big deal out of himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really a laid-back person, having fun and enjoying life
and enjoying his friends, with a great future ahead of him. He was
a man's man.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, his mother's son. On the day he died, Burlsworth was going
home to have dinner and attend church with Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Inexplicably, on a road he had traveled countless times, his
Subaru drifted across the center line, bounced off a
tractor-trailer rig and ran head-on into another, which drove his
car 168 feet backward. At 22, his perfect life was finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does it mean, the stuff on the T-shirt?'' Stoerner asked.
``I guess it just means trying to do everything the way it should
be done. To help your team and your teammates, and to put that goal
above your personal achievements. But I hope that in the future,
what people remember is the way he lived his life, because that's
what's really important.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to accept, and although I know what happened to
Burls, I still sometimes catch myself thinking that ... maybe he's
still out there somewhere, playing.''

<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ With hardly a qualifier, Texas A&AMP;M
coach R.C. Slocum said this week he would not break a sweat if he
knew that the Aggies' kicking game would be the determining factor
in either a repeat Big 12 championship or a national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd feel good about it,'' Slocum said, days away from the
season opener against Louisiana Tech in Shreveport, La.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got punt returners, kickoff guys, a great punter \RShane
Lechler\S who is one the best I've ever been around and probably
one of the top ones ever in college football. No one is going to
have a better punter. So that's pretty good right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum knows he can count on Lechler _ a returning first-team
All-American and consensus All-Big 12 choice. Dante Hall, Chris
Taylor and Jason Webster all are experienced hands at returning
punts and kickoffs. Sophomore Bethel Johnson eventually could add
an exciting dimension to either aspect.
</P>
<P>
   But there are two unknown elements in the Aggies' kicking game _
an incoming freshman deep snapper and a junior walk-on place-kicker
whose varsity experience is one extra-point kick in two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman walk-on Chance Pearce inherits the deep snapper's job
from four-year regular Kyle Lednicky _ whose reliability caused
Slocum to nickname him ``Jugs'' after the pitching machine of the
same name.
</P>
<P>
   Junior Terrence Kitchens became A&AMP;M's place-kicker this summer
after junior veteran Russell Bynum failed a random off-season drug
test that showed elevated levels of testosterone. Bynum has
appealed his suspension for medical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum said Pearce came highly recommended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw \Rformer legendary Brownwood coach\S Gordon Wood this
summer and we were talking about the fact we have three players
from Brownwood on our team,'' Slocum said. ``He said, `The guy who
is going to help you more than anyone is the snapper. He's really
good.' And I feel good about him, too. Chance has been very
consistent for us so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've not seen Terrence kick \Ra field goal\S in a game, but
he's really been consistent this summer all during two-a-days, as
consistent as anyone we've had. At this stage, I feel every bit as
good about the overall kicking game as I did this time a year
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Bynum successfully kicked his first five field goals and
converted his last nine on the way to a 16-for-20 season in 1998.
He hit 30 of 31 PATs. Kitchens' lone contribution as a backup was a
PAT against North Texas after falling out of competition with a hip
flexor injury in the spring of '98.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's been asking me if I'm nervous,'' Kitchens said.
``Actually, I'm excited and anxious. I'm ready to get the season
started. Everyone's been real supportive and that's helped take the
pressure off. I feel more relaxed, more excited than nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Lechler holds for both PATs and field goals. He also kicks off
and is the long-range field goal designate. He isn't worried about
Kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   ``His timing is good, he has good leg strength and his accuracy
is good right now,'' Lechler said. ``He doesn't have more range
than Russell, \Rwhose\S leg had a lot of pop. But Terrance is more
consistent. From 40 yards in, you can almost mark it up. He'll hit
it.''

 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the early years of the Clinton administration,
their aides portrayed Janet Reno and Louis Freeh as one of the
capital's perfect power pairings _ a tough, down-to-earth attorney
general who was happy to have the ex-FBI agent, former Mafia
prosecutor and federal judge as her chief law enforcement officer.
</P>
<P>
   But officials who know them both said the image never really fit
the reality, and, in recent days, the disclosures that the FBI used
heat-generating tear-gas canisters in the April 1993 assault on the
Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas, and then failed to
produce tape recordings from its files confirming that fact, has
split open a seam of discontent.
</P>
<P>
   These tensions have grown slowly over the years as Freeh and
senior FBI officials effectively undercut Reno on high-profile
issues like the appointment of an independent counsel to
investigate political fund raising and the national security
inquiry involving the Los Alamos nuclear scientist, Wen Ho Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict between Reno, Freeh and their two agencies was
apparent Wednesday afternoon when Reno angrily dispatched agents of
the U.S. Marshal's Service to Freeh's headquarters to seize
previously undisclosed tapes that contained radio voice
communications of agents asking for and receiving authorization
from their operational commanders to fire the tear-gas rounds at
Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, FBI officials complained that Reno ordered the
marshals to take custody of the tapes in a way that left a powerful
impression that Reno no longer believed the FBI could be trusted.
``It was a heavy-handed thing to do,'' said one law enforcement
official. ``Like the FBI was going to destroy the evidence?''
</P>
<P>
   The White House sided with Reno in blaming the FBI for the
lapses that placed her in an extremely awkward position. ``The
president is deeply concerned that the attorney general appears to
have been misled and may have been lied to,'' Jake Siewert, a White
House spokesman, said Thursday. ``She has vowed to get to bottom of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reno's own credibility has been grievously damaged.
Republicans in Congress blamed her, not the FBI, for misleading
them about potentially relevant evidence. She had opened herself to
criticism because it was not the FBI, but the Justice Department,
that led what seemed to some officials like half-hearted internal
inquiries into Waco on which she based her long-held conclusion
that there was no possibility the FBI could have started the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the new evidence that has remained in the FBI files for
more than six years does not contradict Reno's conclusions. As FBI
officials reconstructed events, the two flammable tear gas rounds
were fired hours before the assault and landed harmlessly at a
bunker near the compound before the fire started that killed about
80 people, including many children.
</P>
<P>
   It was over Waco that Reno first encountered the powerful
bureaucracy of the FBI. She took office in March 1993 when William
Sessions was the FBI director. Freeh became director in September
1993, and led the agency through the aftermath of the Texas
assault.
</P>
<P>
   At first, FBI officials were skeptical of Reno, a moderate
former Miami prosecutor, but they were won over by her stalwart
defense of the agency's conduct at Waco. She took personal
responsibility for the outcome, blamed the Branch Davidians for
starting the fire and rebuffed all criticism of the FBI's
military-style tactics in the tear-gas assault operation.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, some associates of Reno and Freeh denied that there
was any personal animosity between the two officials or that they
would acknowledge that professional trust in each other had eroded.
But even these officials acknowledged that senior FBI officials had
gradually lost confidence in Reno and that she had grown frustrated
by the law enforcement agency's independence.
</P>
<P>
   Other current and former Justice Department and FBI officials
said the disclosures regarding the use of pyrotechnic tear gas at
Waco represented a final straw to Reno after years of simmering
disputes with the FBI over its independent dealings with Congress
in budget, legislative, national security and investigative
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship seemed to sour after news accounts reported in
1997 that Freeh had urged Reno to seek an independent prosecutor to
investigate how the Democrats financed their 1996 presidential
election campaign _ a position that badly undercut Reno, already
under heavy fire from Republicans in Congress who had attacked her
for refusing to refer the case to an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when Reno's own prosecutor on the campaign finance
inquiry, Charles La Bella, resigned saying he agreed with the FBI
director on the issue of an outside counsel, Reno's credibility
eroded further. La Bella subsequently lost a bid to become U.S.
attorney in San Diego. Later, Freeh awarded La Bella the FBI's
distinguished service medal in a ceremony that Reno did not attend.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, tensions between top officials ignited again
in a bitter crossfire over the handling of an investigation of a
nuclear scientist at the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico. FBI
officials said they had appealed to Reno for permission to begin
electronic surveillance of the scientist, Wen Ho Lee, but Justice
Department officials rejected their request.
</P>
<P>
   Reno angrily replied that FBI officials, including Freeh, had
failed to inform her that the application for surveillance was a
top priority _ even as Republicans in Congress again assailed her
for holding back an inquiry into the suspected theft of highly
classified nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been too forgiving by nature,'' said one law enforcement
official with associates at the Justice Department and the FBI.
``There's a feeling that she just hasn't reigned them in and that
now it may be too late for her to take back control.''

 CLINTONS' VACATION RAISES MONEY, BUT DOES IT WIN VOTES? 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CLINTON-HOUSE) 
 (bl)  
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKANEATELES, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton's theoretical
vacation moved toward its end Thursday with two fund-raisers that
brought the receipts from her 15 days of supposed respite to more
than $800,000 for her undeclared U.S. Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raisers, one at Mulrooney's Bar and Restaurant in
Syracuse and the other on the Cazenovia lakeside lawn of Edward
Green, a lawyer and Syracuse real estate developer, were the fifth
and sixth such events of Mrs. Clinton's vacation, after two last
weekend in Long Island's Hamptons and one each in Massachusetts'
Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard. Meanwhile, the largely Republican
citizens of this once quiet but now celebrity-struck village began
to complain that they hadn't seen enough of her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of this community have put a lot into this visit,
and we haven't had any visiting time,'' said Kathleen Palmieri, 47,
a cardiovascular laboratory consultant and a registered Republican
who has spent much of the last four days waiting on Skaneateles
Street corners with her 9-year-old son for a sight of the first
lady, President Clinton or their daughter, Chelsea. ``I've been
doing it since he got here _ stalking! I feel like I've done
nothing productive. I have no billable hours this week, let's put
it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Palmieri's frustration was echoed up and down Genesee
Street, the village's gift-shop-heavy main thoroughfare, where in
the days before the Clintons' vacation many residents said they
were either bored or irritated by the visit. But after seeing the
presidential motorcade zoom through town, and watching the kind of
saturation coverage of the Clintons on local television that most
New York political candidates can only dream of, the village seemed
swept away by its small part in history. Irritated people now seem
to be those who feel they were ignored.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's not something that happens here very often, so
it's big news,'' said Ron Lombard, the news director of WIXT's
Channel 9, the ABC affiliate in Syracuse. On Monday, WIXT broke
into its regular programming three times with extensive live
reports of the Clintons' arrival in Syracuse and their visit to the
New York State Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Lombard said that the last sitting president to visit the
Syracuse area was Gerald R. Ford during a quick campaign stop in
1976, and that the last sitting president to visit the state fair
was Theodore Roosevelt in 1903.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Clintons' celebrity status upstate translates into
votes for the first lady is still a big question. While the
vacation has clearly brought Mrs. Clinton enormous and constant
front-page exposure _ The Post-Standard, the Syracuse morning
newspaper, even included the news that Buddy, the presidential dog,
escaped from the Clintons' borrowed home for a few minutes Tuesday
_ many voters said this week that, in essence, they were more
sophisticated than to vote for a woman simply because she had
chosen their village for a vacation, no matter how beautiful she
said it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was undecided before, and I'm still undecided,'' said
Shirley Whitbread, 60, who described herself as a retired homemaker
and an independent.
</P>
<P>
   Others were skeptical of the vacation itself. ``I think it's
nice that they came to vacation here,'' said Anne Alcott, 38,
manager of the Banana Republic store in Syracuse and a registered
Republican. ``I just hope that there isn't an ulterior motive _
which I think there is.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Alcott said she was more impressed with New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, who is Mrs. Clinton's likely Republican opponent.
``He's not from Little Rock, you know?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Giuliani does not seem overwhelmingly popular here
either, and is seen by many as the personification of New York
City, which is often viewed as that big, bad city that considers
upstate New York of no more interest than Ohio.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I was in New York City once and it was a big mess,'' said
Curtis Quinn, 17, who was waiting Wednesday to see the Clintons
across the street from the Women's Rights National Historical Park
in Seneca Falls. Quinn, who will be old enough to vote in 2000,
when Mrs. Clinton presumably will be running, said he didn't like
Giuliani and was still mad because his car was towed while he was
in the city.
</P>
<P>
   One person who did seem to have some fun during Mrs. Clinton's
vacation was Mrs. Clinton herself. On Wednesday, while buying a
French vanilla decaf at the Vermont Green Mountain Coffee Specialty
Company in Skaneateles, Mrs. Clinton, who grew up in suburban
Chicago, told reporters that she was having a great time in the
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminds me so much of where I spent my childhood because I
spent every summer at the little lake in northeast Pennsylvania,''
she said. ``The nights were cool, and the mornings were cool, and
it warmed up. It's my favorite kind of weather. It's so nostalgic.
I called my mother last night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons are to leave Friday, by late morning, for
Washington and then Camp David, Md., where they are to spend the
Labor Day weekend resting from their vacation.

SPORTS COLUMN: ESPN EXPECTS TO WIN BASEBALL SUIT; COMEBACK FOR WIDE
WORLD OF SPORTS; COMEBACK FOR KINER'S KORNER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Yankees-Angels game on Sunday could be the final edition of
ESPN's ``Sunday Night Baseball.'' It will certainly be the last one
this season, pending the outcome of a simmering legal bout between
ESPN and Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect ESPN to mark the occasion with weepy speeches
by Jon Miller and Joe Morgan or a dramatic retrospective of
memorable Bat Speeds past.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us are thinking that,'' said Steve Anderson, ESPN's
executive vice president. ``We fully expect to have baseball back.
It's not just what I'm supposed to say, but from the production
side, we're producing a baseball product, and we feel we'll be
doing it next year. And with Wednesday night games and the
playoffs, we still have a lot of baseball left this year.''
</P>
<P>
   True. But there is the matter of a federal court case in
Manhattan, ESPN vs. Office of the Commissioner of Baseball. The
imbroglio began when ESPN acquired the rights to Sunday night
National Football League games last year. Having paid $600 million
a year for the higher-rated NFL games, ESPN chose to move three
Sunday night baseball games in September to ESPN2. Baseball
screamed and revoked ESPN's right to carry the games last September
and this September.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN argues that it can move the games to ESPN2, which has 11
million fewer subscribers than ESPN's76 million. Baseball says that
it cannot, that no event short of a nuclear attack is worthy of
moving the games to the smaller network.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN sued in May when baseball terminated ESPN's $40
million-a-year regular-season contract after this season, two years
before the contract expires. (The case does not threaten ESPN's
contract to carry playoff games through 2000.)
</P>
<P>
   A trial is scheduled to start Nov. 15. At a pretrial hearing
Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Shira A. Scheindlin discouraged
baseball from filing a motion for summary judgment to convince the
court that ESPN's case has no merit (which is pretty much what
baseball has been saying).
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe our rights will be upheld in court and we'll be
able to televise the games on ESPN2,'' Diane Lamb, an ESPN
spokeswoman, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still hope to resolve this,'' Richard Levin, a spokesman
for baseball, said. ``Both sides have talked.'' He did not know if
baseball would accept a settlement that falls short of restoring
all three games to ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   COMEBACK I: OLD `WIDE WORLD'
</P>
<P>
   Since 1998, ``Wide World of Sports'' has existed as the brand
for ABC Sports events _ except for ``Monday Night Football'' _ but
not as the storied anthology show that began in 1961. Thankfully,
the grand old bizarre and eclectic days of Acapulco cliff diving,
bikini championships and horses on ice are returning on ESPN
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC Sports archive came with ESPN's acquisition of Classic
for $175 million exactly two years ago. While ABC's college
football games popped up quickly on Classic, the ``Wide World''
oeuvre took longer to revive because the rights to the original
programs belonged to myriad rights-holders.
</P>
<P>
   Classic has produced five hourlong ``Wide World'' shows (with 10
to 13 more in the works), which will be shown on successive Fridays
at 8 p.m., starting Friday with a compilation of seven Evel Knievel
motorcycle jumps. Next week's show features barrel jumping, Joie
Chitwood's auto thrill show and cliff diving, followed on Sept. 17
by Duke Kahanamoku surfing and wrist wrestling. ``The notion is to
get as much offbeat material as possible,'' Vince Doria, Classic's
executive producer, said. ``It's all the stuff that makes you think
about what `Wide World' was.''
</P>
<P>
   Some great heavyweight fights, including Muhammad Ali's, and
segments featuring Howard Cosell will be seen again.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than simply showing old ``Wide Worlds'' intact, Classic
is mining the best events from various shows, repackaging them,
interviewing participants like the host Jim McKay and using Chris
Fowler as the host.
</P>
<P>
   ``You kind of forget how interesting it all was _ how
interesting, campy and quirky,'' Doria said.
</P>
<P>
   COMEBACK II: `KINER'S KORNER'
</P>
<P>
   If you can resuscitate ``Wide World,'' why not bring ``Kiner's
Korner'' back to life? The original Channel 9 post-game Mets show
with Ralph Kiner as host was a classic: just Ralph and the star or
stars of a game having a cozy chat in a cramped Shea Stadium
studio. Kiner blended insights and malapropisms into a mix
reminiscent of Rocky Marciano's interview and boxing show, ``The
Main Event.''
</P>
<P>
   Channel 9 dumped ``Kiner's Korner'' several years ago, but it
will be back on Fox Sports New York after five Mets games,
beginning Wednesday afternoon. The Korner could return 15 to 20
times next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're 35-plus, and you have pleasant memories of the show,
it seems it would go over well with those folks,'' said Mike
McCarthy, executive producer of FSNY and the MSG Network. ``But
just to watch Ralph's eyes light up when I said we'd do it was
reason enough to bring the show back.''
</P>
<P>
   To be a guest on Kiner's program was ``a real badge of
achievement,'' McCarthy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was for the $50,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Korner's old musical theme will be revived and so may the
long-term sponsor, Rheingold beer. Perhaps Kiner will don a lovely
sports jacket from the Lindsey Nelson collection of plaids,
paisleys and loud colors.

NEXT FIGHT FOR UMPIRES IS OVER CONTROL OF UNION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the legal fight between the umpires union and Major League
Baseball awaits arbitration over the fate of the 22 lost umpires,
the next battle will be intramural _ between two factions for
control of the union.
</P>
<P>
   That fight, which could begin as soon as next week, will take
the form of a move either to seek decertification of the existing
union or certification of a new union to represent all of the
umpires. In either case, the status of the 22 umpires who lost
their on-field jobs at 6 a.m. Thursday will be critical to the
outcome of the move.
</P>
<P>
   Without the 22, the group of umpires opposed to Richie Phillips,
the union leader, believes it will prevail in any sort of vote of
the umpires' bargaining unit. At last survey, the group counted 39
umpires prepared to vote against Phillips. Without the 22 who have
lost their jobs, 32 umpires at most would support Phillips, the
only negotiator the Major League Umpires Association has had.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-Phillips faction is also moving ahead on another front,
intensifying its efforts to obtain information from Phillips on the
union's finances and the payments some umpires receive from Pilot
Air Freight, a Philadelphia company that Phillips operates that
transports much of the equipment for major league umpires.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Phillips, an American League umpire who is no relation to
Richie Phillips, acknowledged Thursday that he wrote a letter on
his and other umpires' behalf to the union leader last week
requesting copies of the union's federal financial disclosure forms
and full disclosure on the Pilot payments. Some other umpires have
identified seven umpires as being on the payroll of the shipping
company: Jerry Crawford, the union president; Richie Garcia, the
vice president; Bruce Froemming, a former vice president; Gerry
Davis; Terry Tata; Steve Rippley, and Drew Coble.
</P>
<P>
   All seven umpires support Richie Phillips _ Garcia and Coble
have lost their jobs as a result of his mass resignation strategy.
Some of those who do not support Phillips contend that there is a
conflict of interest inherent in the Pilot relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Richie Phillips did not return a phone call seeking comment on
the Pilot issue and the move to oust him.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Phillips said he had not received a reply to his letter
from Richie Phillips. ``He doesn't share information with us,''
said the umpire, who has been one of the more active members of the
group trying to change the union's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly looking at all of our options,'' Dave Phillips
said in a telephone interview. ``We have a big task at hand. We're
absolutely saddened that 22 guys lost their jobs by his failed
strategy. We wish he would take responsibility and resign in the
best interest of the union. He's the one who put these men on the
street.''
</P>
<P>
   The 22 umpires were part of a mass resignation devised by Richie
Phillips as a negotiating strategy. The resignations remained in
effect as part of the union's settlement with baseball on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As new umpires began replacing the departed ones, the
anti-Phillips faction continued to plan its course of action. In
previous differences of opinion, Phillips has been able to defuse
the opposition. But this time his opponents appear more determined
to unseat the union's leader.
</P>
<P>
   Indications Thursday were that the anti-Phillips group was
leaning toward trying to have the union decertified, but it could
ask the National Labor Relations Board to oversee a certification
election. Under that scenario, another union, either an existing
one or one created by the insurgent umpires, would challenge the
Major League Umpires Association as the umpires' collective
bargaining agent.
</P>
<P>
   For either effort, the umpires would have to present the labor
board with cards signed by 30 percent of the bargaining unit. If
the insurgents have 39 umpires prepared to vote against Phillips,
they would represent more than 30 percent of the total number of
umpires, even if the 22 were included.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition group would opt for an election sanctioned by the
labor board rather than a vote within the union because of the
difference in the definition of union membership and a bargaining
unit. The union membership is anyone the union considers a member;
the bargaining unit is all the umpires who are working whether they
are union members or not.
</P>
<P>
   An internal union vote would give Phillips more supporters. He
and Crawford, the president, would count the 22 as voting members,
and 17 of the 25 new umpires could not vote because they have not
joined the union.
</P>
<P>
   But the bargaining unit lineup, one scorekeeper said, gives the
dissidents the edge: The anti-Phillips group includes 19
established and 12 new American League umpires and three
established and five new National League umpires, for 39 total. The
pro-Phillips bloc has 28 NL umpires, including eight who are new,
and four veteran AL umpires, making 32.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not involved in the counting of numbers,'' Dave Phillips
said, ``but I'm pretty confident we have a strong majority of our
membership adamantly opposed to Richie Phillips, his failed
strategy and what he's created in 22 guys being fired.''

BOEING'S CONDIT STILL LEAVES OPEN THE POSSIBILITY OF FLEXIBLE
WORKWEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN AND JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A day after The Boeing Co. settled its biggest labor
contract, Chairman Phil Condit resurrected one of the thorniest
issues, suggesting the company could boost productivity by
experimenting with flexible workweeks.
</P>
<P>
   Condit envisions pilot projects with the International
Association of Machinists that would introduce alternative
schedules _ under which employees work shorter or longer shifts or
into the weekend _ as part of a broader plan to create a leaner
aerospace company.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of mandatory changes in the workweek was a flash point
during negotiations, and the union threatened to strike if the
company tried to force non-traditional schedules on its members.
</P>
<P>
   Condit, however, wants to ``experiment'' with the idea under a
7-year-old provision that requires both the company and the union
to agree before a schedule is changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can work with the union to say, `OK let's try a
couple ways; let's experiment,''' Condit said Thursday in an
exclusive interview with the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   The union says it simply is not interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members don't want a non-traditional workweek,'' said Bill
Johnson, president of the union's District Lodge 751, which covers
the Puget Sound region. ``It's not an item of discussion. ... There
is no wiggle room on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Condit argued that many workers misunderstand the concept, in
which employees could work their 40-hour weeks in three or four
days, including weekends. They worry the company will force parents
to abandon their children on weekends and create other disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, both sides could discuss pilot projects that
might affect only certain workers and functions and could be
voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   It is ``not that we are going to come roaring in here with a
great big full-blown proposal,'' Condit said.
</P>
<P>
   Altering the work schedule is only one line in Boeing's
blueprint to boost productivity, lower costs and win new airplane
orders. If the company fails, it will cede both customers and jobs
to its Toulouse, France-based rival, Airbus Industrie, Condit said.
</P>
<P>
   The contract, which addressed many of the union's concerns, was
another step in creating a more productive work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means people that you pay well have to be productive in the
context of the business,'' Condit said. ``I want a highly motivated
work force ... excited about what they are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Condit is eager to employ workshops that bring
together Machinists, engineers and others to devise better ways to
build airplanes. Those groups, known as Accelerated Improvement
Workshops, will examine a range of issues, such as why an airplane
part didn't fit initially and why a mechanic was forced to waste
time searching for tools and parts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most important for Condit, and the investors who buy and sell
his company's stock, is that Boeing must become more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   The aerospace giant can't allow planes worth more than $150
million to idle at its plants, as Airbus becomes an increasingly
potent competitor, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A ``747 sitting on the flight line out there is $160 million
worth of stuff, and every day it sits there, we are holding it and
not getting paid for it,'' Condit said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing defused its most explosive labor situation Wednesday,
when Machinists approved Boeing's contract offer, and Condit
attributed much of the success to the fact that both camps have
been talking for two years.
</P>
<P>
   If Machinists had rejected the company's offer Wednesday, they
would have crippled Boeing's prodution lines as the company
recovered from two years of problems. Instead, workers embraced the
offer, passing it with an 86 percent margin.
</P>
<P>
   Condit made clear that although negotiating a good contract for
the company was important, it will mean little if Boeing isn't
competitive with Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two competitors,'' he said. ``We know who they are.
It's us and them. If we don't get the orders, they do. It's that
simple.''
</P>
<P>
   If Boeing loses to Airbus, nothing in the contract will protect
jobs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we fail to win orders, if we are not competitive with
Airbus, the work here declines,'' he said. ``If we are competitive,
we have a real opportunity to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Condit said it's time that Airbus makes it on its own, without
help from the government subsidies that it has long enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, British Aerospace, one of the four companies
that make up Airbus Industrie, said it had asked Britain's
government for an $800 million loan to help fund its participation
in the A3XX, the planned Airbus superjumbo jetliner that will seat
more passengers than Boeing's 747.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1992 agreement between the United States and European
authorities, the Airbus consortium can get up to 30 percent of a
new plane's development cost from the government.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus has said the A3XX will cost at least $12 billion to
develop, so it stands to get about $3.6 billion from the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has long argued the Airbus subsidies have created an
unfair playing field, and it has urged the U.S. government to try
to prevent subsidies from being used to help develop the A3XX,
which Airbus hopes will drive a stake through Boeing's 747
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to pay it back (government subsidies),'' Condit said
of Airbus, ``but the conditions under which they pay it back are
very different from the world we live in.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than paying back the loan on a fixed rate regardless of
whether the market develops, as Boeing must do when it borrows from
a bank, Airbus pays back government loans when it delivers planes,
Condit said. And if the market does not develop, Airbus is off the
hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changes the fundamental financial equation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Condit said he is encouraged that the World Trade Organization
is moving toward rules-based trade requirements in a global
economy.
</P>
<P>
   `That's what the WTO is all about,'' he said. ``How do you build
a set of rules-based trade requirements that say, `We are going to
live in a global economy and there have to be rules'?
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, the faster we get there, the better
off we are. I'm also not going to stand around and say we can't
compete in the interim, because I think we can.''
</P>
<P>
   On other issues, Condit said:
</P>
<P>
   _He is a little more optimistic than he was about 747
production. Because of the economic downturn in Asia that saw many
airlines in that region delay or cancel orders for widebody jets,
Boeing had warned that production of the 747, the company's most
profitable plane, could be cut to one per month next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's looking better than it did,'' he said. ``I'm not
breathing easy yet, but I'm breathing better.''
</P>
<P>
   Condit said he continues to see signs that the situation in Asia
may be improving.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, China Airlines, Taiwan's largest airline, agreed to
buy 13 747-400 cargo planes for $3.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   _Condit defended his second in command, Boeing President Harry
Stonecipher. Stonecipher was a lightning rod for union members'
criticism during the past two weeks, as they blamed him for many of
the hard-line positions the company took in the early stages of the
contract talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry sometimes gets blamed for things that he had no part at
all in,'' Condit said.
</P>
<P>
   _Condit said the contract represented a new chapter for Boeing,
but added.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't just turn the page, though, and say, `Everything is
now different.' There are opportunities there to work together
productively. And there is an opportunity to fail to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world will continue to change ... it won't look the same
three years from now. ... Airbus will change. We are going to deal
with new designs for airplanes. ... If labor is willing to work
with the company, I think we can be successful. If not, it's likely
that somebody else will get the jobs''
</P>
<P>
   Condit noted that a number of years ago, longshore workers'
union said they would never handle containers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what you discover is that's the only way stuff comes. If
you decide that's too hard, it all goes somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you say, nope, it's better to handle containers and have a
job than to be really strict about this. It's that change that's
always the hard part.''

IT'S HIGH TIME TO HOLD UMPIRES ACCOUNTABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JACK CURRY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The four men strolled onto the field at Yankee
Stadium, three clad in red shirts and one wearing a blue shirt,
looking as anonymous as beer vendors. They toiled for almost four
hours, were in proper position, performed as if they cared and were
consistent. Besides Paul O'Neill's routine outburst, no one
complained about the umpires, which is what should happen every
day.
</P>
<P>
   It is unfortunate that 22 major league umpires stopped working
Thursday because it is unfortunate whenever anyone loses his job.
There are emotional stories from suddenly unemployed people about
sick family members, mortgage payments and children's tuition,
whether they are umpires who resigned, truck drivers who angered
the boss, or waiters who were laid off because their restaurant
failed. No one revels in anyone else's plight.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a positive that could and should emerge from the
silly labor strategy that resulted in one-third of the umpires
being released. The umpires have been humbled. They learned in an
emphatic manner that they are not the Ken Griffey Jr.'s of their
profession. They can be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a smattering of guys who have the attitude, `You
can't do that to me,''' Joe Torre admitted before Thursday's game.
``I don't like that. Any time you think you're bigger than the
game, you're not good for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be worthwhile if baseball instituted an evaluation
system in which umpires are judged and held accountable for their
work, like almost every employee in America. Sandy Alderson, the
executive vice president for baseball operations, wants all umpires
to be monitored as one group by Major League Baseball next season.
</P>
<P>
   There should be no more laziness on shots sprayed around the
park, no more inconsistencies on the strike zone, no more baiting
of players by moving toward them to invite confrontation. If these
changes are made, the umpires will enhance their reputations and
the game. The game is what matters, on the field, where the Yankees
pounded the Athletics, 9-3, Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal long-term has been for baseball to have a group of
umpires who are well-respected for training, expertise and
integrity,'' Alderson said. ``We want our umpires to be regarded as
the best officials in the world. Right now, that's not the way
they're perceived.''
</P>
<P>
   Perception often becomes reality. It is unfair to characterize
all umpires as inferior, but all it takes is one umpire's
incompetence for an entire crew to be branded. If one ump does not
run into the outfield on a sinking liner, all four look sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not going to care about it, take it home,'' Andy
Pettitte said flatly. ``It's too bad it affected people's
livelihoods. But if anything good comes out of this, maybe it'll be
an evaluation system. All we're asking for is effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Richie Phillips, the embattled head of the umpire's union, has
said that baseball does not care about the game because it accepted
the resignations of umpires with more than 20 years of experience.
That is an easy remark for a desperate man to utter, but it is
untrue.
</P>
<P>
   Alderson cares. He thinks umpires should be supervised more
strictly, wants to include off-season training and educational
seminars as part of their job, and feels the mandated rotation of
umpires in the post-season should be replaced by selection on
merit. If an umpire is ineffective, Alderson believes, baseball
should be permitted to dismiss him, just as in other jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is trying to develop a computerized simulator that
would enable umpires to practice calling strikes the way they are
defined in the rule book. That sounds more appealing than the
current behavior of some umpires who, one baseball official said,
work just a few games each spring at their own discretion and then
jump behind the plate rusty in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I hope we can change is the image of the
umpire,'' John Hirschbeck, one of the umpires who led the
anti-Phillips faction, said recently. ``The fans need to know we
care about getting calls right and hustling on every play.''
</P>
<P>
   One umpire told an American League player that umpires who spend
10 years in the minors are like players who do the same and are not
talented enough to be promoted. That is highly questionable,
because there was little turnover among major league umpires before
these resignations. But the umpire insisted his view was accurate
and said all of the best umps were already in the majors. So the
player asked, ``How would we know?'' The umpire had no answer.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill said he felt sorry for the departing umpires, and Mark
McGwire was cognizant enough of Frank Pulli's last game on
Wednesday night that he flipped him a game ball. It is a difficult
period for some, but it is also an important period for baseball to
improve the umpiring situation forever and make the game better.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is umpires should be held to the same scrutiny as
the rest of us,'' Torre said. ``Managers don't do their job, they
get fired. Players don't do their job, they go to the minors.
Umpires don't do their job, I don't know what happens. I'd like it
to be the same. Everybody put in a day's work.''

ISRAEL CONVICTS U.S. TEEN-AGER AFTER HE ADMITS TO MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Three judges in Tel Aviv on Thursday convicted an
American teen-ager of premeditated murder after he publicly
admitted his guilt in a grisly slaying in Maryland two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager, Samuel Sheinbein, formerly of Silver Spring, Md.,
now awaits sentencing, as the Israeli judges evaluate a plea
agreement in a case that American prosecutors have contended should
never have been tried in an Israeli courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Sheinbein, who fled to Israel in an effort to avoid prosecution
in Maryland, responded Thursday with a plea of guilty to 10 charges
related to the 1997 strangling and dismembering of Alfredo Enrique
Tello Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Tel Aviv District Court Judge Uri Goren then handed down the
ruling, saying, ``Based on what the defendant admitted to, and
based on the testimony of his father before the grand jury in
Maryland, we convict the defendant of premeditated murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Before reaching a decision on punishment, the panel of three
magistrates presided over by Goren plans to review a report by
Sheinbein's probation officer. The report is not due until
mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   But the judges made clear Thursday that they did not necessarily
feel bound by the plea agreement between prosecutors and
Sheinbein's Israeli lawyers, which recommended a sentence of 24
years. Though attacked by Maryland prosecutors as ``outrageously''
lenient, a sentence of 24 years is considered quite severe in
Israel for a crime committed by a minor. If the agreement holds,
Sheinbein, who has already been held for nearly two years, could be
eligible for parole in 14 years, at the age of 33.
</P>
<P>
   In their comments in the courtroom Thursday, Israeli prosecutors
dismissed American criticism of their handling of the Sheinbein
case, saying they had no choice but to work within the strictures
of Israeli law.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of their sensitivity to this unusual scrutiny, the
prosecutors, defense attorneys and presiding magistrates reached an
very unusual agreement to allow television cameras in the
courtroom, though under strict limitations. Though there was no
videotaping of comments by the defendant himself, the excerpts from
statements by lawyers and judges on the evening news tonight
represented the first time many Israelis had watched the
proceedings of a criminal court. In court Thursday, Sheinbein
answered repeated questions about his culpability with a quiet
``yes'' in Hebrew, a language he was not believed to have spoken
previously.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Though he had never visited Israel before arriving as a fugitive
in 1997, Sheinbein successfully claimed citizenship based on his
father's birth in what was then British-ruled Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli diplomats and law-enforcement officials made no secret
of their desire to send the accused murderer back to the United
States. Government lawyers argued that a claim of citizenship
should be based not just on parentage but also on having some
demonstrable ``affinity'' with Israel. The Supreme Court upheld
Sheinbein's petition, stating that Israeli law states clearly that
the child of a citizen also has the right to citizenship and that
the validity of Sheinbein's father's citizenship was never in
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   As a citizen, Sheinbein was protected by a decades-old amendment
to Israel's extradition law prohibiting the deportation of any
Israeli facing a possible death sentence for crimes that were not
capital offenses in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Sheinbein was 17 when he and a friend strangled Tello and cut up
his corpse. The friend committed suicide while in jail awaiting
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Israel forbids life sentences for minors, but in Maryland,
Sheinbein could have been tried as an adult. Maryland prosecutors
have said they would have sought life imprisonment, not death.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Parliament has since revoked this exception to its
extradition treaties, though the exception continues to apply to
Sheinbein.

MAN SLAIN BY POLICE FEARED OWN VIOLENT IMPULSES, RECORDS SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Brooklyn man fatally shot by police Monday had
told doctors at a psychiatric hospital that he increasingly feared
his own impulses toward violence and repeatedly took cocaine and
psychedelic drugs, his medical records show.
</P>
<P>
   The records portray Gidone Busch as a troubled person who once
threw furniture around a ward and had to be physically restrained.
The accounts come from doctors, social workers and nurses who
treated him for months at a time over the last three years when he
was committed, sometimes involuntarily, for treatment of
depression, manic behavior and aggression.
</P>
<P>
   They said that when he was not taking his prescribed
tranquilizers and anti-psychotic drugs, Busch was delusional,
believed himself to be the messiah, and was capable of doing harm
to himself and others.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Busch attacked the officers with a hammer, striking
one, and that they opened fire because they feared for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   But in the days since the shooting, the use of deadly force by
police to subdue an emotionally disturbed man has been harshly
criticized by community leaders and some politicians. And Busch's
parents, who live on Long Island, insist that while their son was
mentally ill, he was never violent and could not have been a threat
to police.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what Busch's psychiatric history shows, the
information is unlikely to quiet police critics who insist that the
officers should have been able to restrain him without deadly
force.
</P>
<P>
   That history, and whether Busch should have been kept off the
streets and in psychiatric hospitals, are also likely to be
subjects of inquiry by the Brooklyn grand jury investigating the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The records of three of Busch's involuntary admissions to the
Payne-Whitney Clinic of New York Weill Cornell Center of
Presbyterian Hospital indicate that at least in his coherent
moments, he believed himself capable of violence.
</P>
<P>
   The confidential records from the hospital, formerly called New
York Hospital, were obtained by The New York Times through a staff
member at the hospital. Busch's family has acknowledged that they
acted to have him admitted to hospitals against his wishes for
treatment of the manic behavior and sometimes debilitating
depressions. Doctors said he suffered from schizoaffective
disorder, which is characterized by mood swings and symptoms of
schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The last time he was admitted, in December 1997, Busch told
doctors that he had come close to knifing a man who was sharing a
room in a hostel with him in Israel earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   A nurse at the hospital wrote in Busch's records during that
stay that the ``patient stated he has been becoming increasingly
physically violent and he did not know how to stop this from
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Busch dropped out of medical school 10 years ago after learning
he had an incurable kidney disease and embarked on a meandering
journey through various sects and movements of Orthodox and Hasidic
Judaism. The quest took him to Israel, where he lived on and off
for about seven years, according to his family.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, Busch was hospitalized for psychosis three times
between 1992 and 1995, a period when he became so fervently
entrenched in religious rituals that his family feared he had
fallen in with an extremist cult.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   According to the medical records, Busch repeatedly refused to
admit he was ill or to take his medication during his hospital
stays. Following a pattern often seen in the mentally ill, he
stopped taking his drugs shortly after each release from the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   His parents, the doctors' notes over the years showed, tried to
help him, but could not deal with him if he was not on medication.

<P>
   DIX HILLS, N.Y. _ A few weeks ago, after visiting his
grandparents' graves, Gidone Busch wrote a poem about finding peace
among the souls of his family at rest. Thursday, the man slain by
police Monday night in Borough Park, Brooklyn, was buried next to
his Nanny and Papa after a solemn service that focused on his
sensitivity and generosity rather than his violent struggle with
mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stepped around the beds of this one and that one, each with
a face, each with a life _ I felt loved by each one,'' read the
poem, which Busch's brother, Glenn, recited at the funeral. ``Not a
soul in this place has any objection to honesty, or any objection
to truth.''
</P>
<P>
   About 350 mourners, nearly all friends and family, packed into
the plain chapel of the I.J. Morris funeral home here for a
memorial devoid of the politics that have swirled around Busch's
death. Police were not mentioned; nor was the mayor. Instead,
Busch's two brothers and two rabbis swallowed back tears as they
spoke of his sense of humor, sharp insights and spiritual quest to
grow closer to God.
</P>
<P>
   At Mount Hebron Cemetery in Flushing, Queens, under a blue sky
muted by a layer of cottony clouds, mourners spent more than 15
minutes shoveling dirt to fill Busch's grave, according to Jewish
tradition. His mother, Doris Busch Boskey, shook her head again and
again, as her husband wrapped his arms tight around her chest.
Busch's fiancee, Netanya Ullman, mumbled her own personal prayers,
one friend's hand comforting her shoulder, another's clutching her
waist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let his memory be a lesson to us,'' Rabbi Yakov Saacks, one of
his teachers, said at the funeral. ``There are people who need
help. There are people who need guidance.''
</P>
<P>
   Busch, 31, who was called Gary, was shot 12 times by four police
officers outside his basement apartment Monday evening after he
struck one of them with a hammer, which he had inscribed with the
four letters of God's name in Hebrew. Having dropped out of medical
school upon discovering he had kidney disease, Busch was
hospitalized at least four times in the New York area for violent
behavior and psychiatric problems and had become a devoted follower
of Rabbi Nachman, a Hasidic mystic.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's funeral reflected Busch's journey in Judaism from a
secular childhood to years studying Torah in Israel to life in the
Orthodox enclave of Borough Park. Most in the chapel wore the black
nylon yarmulkes handed out by the funeral home, indicating they do
not normally cover their heads, as observant Jews do. Scattered
among the crowd were the knitted skullcaps favored by the modern
Orthodox. And in the back row, marked ``men only,'' sat a dozen
Hasidim in black hats and robes.
</P>
<P>
   While the rabbis invoked Busch's commitment to studying the
Torah and observing its mitzvot, or commandments, his brothers
spoke of his abiding closeness to family, telling stories filled
with both his laughter and his pain.
</P>
<P>
   His brother Gregg Busch recalled a Thanksgiving when Gary had
noticed he was upset and told him, ``Life is too short, you need to
be happy.'' His other brother, Glenn Busch, said that Gary told him
he had ``realized how fragile life is'' after having a patient die
and witnessing something else tragic in the emergency room during
medical school.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Busch joked about how Gary would ask what his brother was
ordering for dinner before agreeing to come over to study (pizza
and Chinese food would lure him). More somberly, he recalled a
visit to the psychiatric hospital when Gary pointed out that he and
his brother were the same height, and suggested they switch
clothes, and places.
</P>
<P>
   At restaurants, ``he would order extra bread,'' Glenn Busch
remembered. ``He would take it out afterwards and grab the first
person he would meet on the street who seemed like he needed a meal
and give it to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Saacks and Rabbi Chaim Bausk of Young Israel of East
Northport, N.Y., whose homes Busch visited for many Sabbaths,
described a bright, articulate man who sometimes succumbed to dark
moods.
</P>

TOLEDO STUCK WITH QB PLATOON, FOR NOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Junior Drew Bennett, a former walk-on with 11
college passes to his name, will take the field Saturday evening as
UCLA's starting quarterback against Boise State.
</P>
<P>
   It will be Bennett's first start since high school, four years
ago. In the opener that season, he threw three interceptions. Among
Bennett's unproven qualities are toughness, resiliency, leadership
and moxie. Even Bruins coach Bob Toledo admitted Bennett has ``not
looked great in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in the first half, Toledo will replace Bennett with
Cory Paus, who has one year in UCLA's system and no game
experience. Paus will play a few series or perhaps a quarter, then
Bennett will return. Or maybe he won't. Toledo isn't sure how the
platoon will work or how long it will last. But he knows one thing:
He hates it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you need a (starting) quarterback and have him get the
most repetitions,'' he said. ``I don't know how long we'll go with
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Most coaches dread quarterback uncertainty of any kind, whether
it's an unproven starter or a veteran platoon. But UCLA and Pac-10
history show quarterback quagmires aren't necessarily a recipe for
defeat. Either the situation resolves itself _ usually through
injury or superior performance _ or the quarterback platoon
survives and thrives. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
On Sept. 18, 1965, UCLA opened the season at Michigan State with a
rookie quarterback. His name: Gary Beban, future Heisman Trophy
winner. After a 13-3 loss to Michigan State, Beban led UCLA to the
Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, after an injury to starter Steve Bono, the Bruins asked
a former walk-on to rescue them from an 0-3-1 start. His name: Rick
Neuheisel. He led the Bruins to seven wins in their last eight
games, including the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, former coach Terry Donahue watched two quarterbacks
compete for the starting job in spring practice and training camp.
Six days before the season opener, Donahue picked a strong-armed
transfer as his starter. His name: Troy Aikman. He led the Bruins
to 20 wins in two years.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1995 season opener, injuries forced the Bruins to insert
a true freshman, three months out of high school, against No.12
Miami. His name: Cade McNown.
</P>
<P>
   This decade alone, Pac-10 quarterback platoons have beaten
Nebraska in the Holiday Bowl (Arizona last year), won the
conference championship (USC in 1995), and won the national title
(Washington in 1991).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's doable, particularly to start the season and get a feel
for which guy is the best in games,'' said former USC and current
Nevada-Las Vegas coach John Robinson, who rotated Brad Otton and
Kyle Wachholtz in '95.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public reaction tends to be negative, but I think (Toledo)
has made the intelligent move. Rotating Bennett and Paus gives him
a chance to see which guy will provide the intangibles.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Although the three greatest quarterbacks in UCLA history (Beban,
Aikman, McNown) emerged from uncertainty, there's no guarantee of
success. In 1989, Bret Johnson won the job over Jim Bonds and the
Bruins won just three games. In 1990, Johnson transferred during
training camp, Bonds failed in the opener, and freshman Tommy
Maddox took control of a five-win season.
</P>
<P>
   It takes secure players and sensitive coaches for a quarterback
platoon to thrive. The coaches cannot play favorites, the
quarterbacks must agree to their roles unconditionally and the team
must accept two leaders. But the most important ingredient, by most
accounts, is a dominant running game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's paramount to having a two-quarterback system work,''
said former UCLA quarterback Tom Ramsey, who shared time with Jay
Schroeder in 1980. ``Life on the quarterback is much easier when
there's a big-time guy at tailback, because the defense has to
focus on stopping the runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``What UCLA has this year with DeShaun Foster is comparable to
what we had with Freeman McNeil.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, McNeil rushed for 1,105 yards. In 1987, tailback Gaston
Green made Aikman's life easier with 1,098 yards. Karim
Abdul-Jabbar did the same for McNown in 1995, gaining a
school-record 1,571.
</P>
<P>
   The same was true across town in 1995, when USC tailback Delon
Washington supported Otton and Wachholtz with 1,109 yards, and at
Arizona last year, when tailback Trung Canidate gained 1,220 behind
rotating quarterbacks Keith Smith and Ortege Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   For UCLA to survive its quarterback platoon this year, Foster
and the young offensive line must gain ground consistently.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the quarterback has to win games, it's harder for
everybody,'' Robinson said. ``My sense is that UCLA will be able to
run the ball. If that's true, they won't have to say, `OK,
quarterback, go win the game for us.' Instead, they can say, `OK,
quarterback, just don't make any mistakes.' That's a big
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson didn't plan to platoon Otton and Wachholtz in 1995, but
after several games neither player had taken charge. Otton finished
with 256 attempts, Wachholtz 171. USC won nine games and, behind
Otton's hot hand, beat Northwestern in the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stuff about needing one quarterback because you need one
leader, that's a load of (bull),'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   The psychological game might be as important to quarterback
platoons as a successful running game. Midway through last season,
Arizona offensive coordinator Dino Babers approached Smith and
Jenkins separately and asked if they wanted him to name a starter.
Both said no; they preferred the platoon.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Smith and Jenkins enjoyed splitting time. More likely,
their responses reflected fear of being left behind. Either way,
the system wouldn't have worked without both players being in total
agreement. As with Bennett and Paus, Smith and Jenkins are good
friends. There was no jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used a set of rules,'' Babers said. ``If my office door was
shut, that meant I was talking personal. I never talked football
without both guys present. We never started a meeting without both
guys present. Kids are sensitive about those things.
</P>
<P>
   ``In practice, we split it down the middle and let them handle
their own rotation. They were always joined at the hip. We never
sent one guy here and one guy there.''
</P>
<P>
   Platoons may be harder on coaches than on quarterbacks. It's
tough enough preparing one guy to play _ to understand the system
and the opposing defense, to memorize alignments and recognize
blitzes _ much less two.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the starter gets 80 percent of the snaps in practice.
In a platoon, repetitions are split 50-50. The result is two
quarterbacks who aren't fully prepared. In the case of Bennett and
Paus, the Bruins have two (begin ital)inexperienced(end ital)
quarterbacks who aren't fully prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason nobody in the NFL does it, and it's because
it generally doesn't work,'' Bruins offensive coordinator Al Borges
said. ``It fails a lot more times than it succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gone into seasons not knowing who the quarterback will
be, and it always works itself out. Drew and Cory are both
even-tempered kids with good discretion. We're just going to be
patient and see what happens. A lot of times, I've found, it talks
back to you.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's season hinges on the answer.

EX-BROKER FACES BROAD FEDERAL CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Colo., Ga., Fla., Pa.)  (js) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Randolph Pace, the man who prosecutors say was the
mastermind behind a big securities fraud in the early to mid-1990s,
was charged Thursday with directing a wider conspiracy that
involved three brokerage firms, the manipulation of 11 companies'
stocks and $200 million in illegal profits.
</P>
<P>
   Pace, a former brokerage firm executive, has been under
indictment since November on charges of manipulating the shares of
six companies through Sterling Foster, a defunct New York
securities firm that prosecutors say he secretly controlled. But
according to a 26-count superseding indictment brought Thursday by
Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New
York, Pace's fraudulent activities were much more extensive.
Previously, prosecutors had said that Pace and Sterling Foster had
defrauded investors of $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Now they say that Pace, 53, and Alan Novich, 52, a longtime
associate, also enlisted the aid of eight individuals, including
employees and top management at VTR Capital and Investors
Associates, two defunct brokerage firms, to help manipulate the
stocks and reap illegal gains. Prosecutors say Pace, a founder of
Rooney Pace Inc., a defunct brokerage firm, tried to conceal his
involvement because he had been barred from the securities
industry. Nevertheless, prosecutors say that he controlled Sterling
Foster and VTR Capital, a firm that had offices in New York,
Colorado, Florida, Georgia and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Ms. White said, ``Today's charges should serve
notice that any violations of the federal securities laws, even the
most creative and complex schemes, will be uncovered by law
enforcement and aggressively prosecuted.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert G. Morvillo, the lawyer representing Pace, said that his
client intended to plead not guilty to the charges.
</P>
<P>
   The fraud mapped out by prosecutors took place from 1995 through
1997 and began with the issuance to Pace and his associates of
cheap ``founders'' stock in companies about to go public in
offerings underwritten by VTR Capital and Investors Associates.
Before the offerings, Pace and his colleagues agreed to sell their
shares to the underwriters at prearranged prices, resulting in
substantial profits to the insiders. Then shares in the companies
were sold to the public by brokers using abusive sales practices,
such as misrepresenting facts about the companies and their
prospects to pump up demand for the stock. This created illegal
profits for the firms selling the shares. Most of the companies'
share prices subsequently collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   The companies whose shares were underwritten by VTR Capital and
Investors Associates were Interiors Inc., a company that made
picture frames; Compare Generiks, a distributor of over-the-counter
drugs; Perry's Majestic Beer, a brewer; Decor Group, a maker of
sculptures, and Superior Supplements, a manufacturer of dietary
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Also named in Thursday's indictment were Warren Schreiber, 43, a
former broker with VTR Capital; Vincent Grieco, 33, co-manager of
the Melville, N.Y., office of Investors Associates; Judah Wernick,
35, a principal of Patterson Travis, a brokerage firm with offices
in New York; Robert Landau, 57, an investor in three of the
offerings, and Nancy Shalek, 44, chairman of three of the
companies. VTR Capital and Investors Associates were charged, as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Co-conspirators named in the indictment were Lawrence Penna, 55,
the former president and chief executive of Investors Associates;
Herman Epstein, 58, compliance director of the firm, and Douglas
Mangan, 37, a former supervisor at the firm's Melville, N.Y.,
branch. Phone calls to Schreiber, Ms. Shalek and Landau and Novich
were not returned last night. The others could not be reached.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Separately, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced
Thursday that it had filed a civil securities fraud case against
Penna, Epstein and Mangan, saying the executives had made more than
$33 million in illegal profits through the fraudulent underwritings
and manipulations. The men settled with the SEC, neither admitting
nor denying the accusations. Investors Associates was the subject
of 47 regulatory actions before it closed last year.
</P>
<P>
   Six individuals involved in the Sterling Foster case have
already pleaded guilty to federal charges and have agreed to
forfeit $32 million in illegal gains. These people include Adam
Lieberman, former president of Sterling Foster, and Hartley
Bernstein, a securities lawyer who was close to Pace.
</P>
<P>
   Securities lawyers say that the new charges against Pace turn up
the heat on him to identify other individuals who may have been
involved in the fraudulent activities.
</P>
<P>
   Pace is a close friend of Richard Harriton, the former president
of Bear Stearns Securities Corp., the subsidiary of the Wall Street
firm that processes trades for smaller, less well-capitalized
brokerage firms. Harriton resigned from Bear Stearns last month
after being accused by the SEC of securities fraud for his role in
the failure of A.R. Baron, a brokerage firm that defrauded
investors of $75 million. Bear Stearns cleared A.R. Baron's trades.
Harriton is fighting the SEC charges.
</P>
<P>
   Harriton's son Matthew was closely involved in three of the five
companies whose shares, prosecutors say, were manipulated by Pace
and his colleagues. Matthew Harriton was either a director or the
recipient of founders' stock or both in Decor Group, Perry's
Majestic Beer, and Superior Supplements. Harriton did not return a
phone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Penna of Investors Associates has been a major Democratic
fund-raiser and contributed $10,000 in 1997 to the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee. Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, D-N.J.,
was co-chairman of the committee at the time. Investors Associates
contributed $50,000 to Torricelli's campaign against Richard A.
Zimmer, a Republican, in 1996, according to The Star-Ledger of
Newark. Torricelli invested in the initial stock offering of
Compare Generiks, one of the offerings prosecutors said was
manipulated, making $52,446 profit in 24 hours, according to The
Star-Ledger. Penna was Torricelli's account executive on the
transaction, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli could not be reached for comment Thursday night, nor
could Penna.

HSBC'S DEAL FOR REPUBLIC TO BE DELAYED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Japan, Britain)  (js) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   LONDON _ HSBC Holdings PlC said Thursday that its pending $10.3
billion acquisition of Republic New York Corp. would be delayed
because of an investigation of Republic's securities unit.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Japanese officials are investigating whether the
securities unit inflated the net asset value of an investment fund
owned by large institutional investors in Japan, The Wall Street
Journal reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Republic, the holding company for the Republic National Bank of
New York, declined to comment on the investigation. In a statement,
it said that it was cooperating with investigators and that it had
suspended the chief executive of the unit, James Edward Sweeney.
Republic also said that it had replaced the manager of the futures
department.
</P>
<P>
   HSBC, which announced on May 10 that it would pay $72 a share
for Republic, said in a statement Thursday that it hoped to close
the deal but that ``as a result of this investigation, it may take
longer than originally anticipated to complete the regulatory
process.''
</P>
<P>
   HSBC, Britain's largest bank, said it was waiting for more
details from Republic and investigators before completing the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to know what kind of exposure is involved and
if it is material and all of the rest,'' said Richard Beck, a
spokesman for HSBC in London. ``We have to wait for Republic to
update us with new information.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Republic fell 10.4 percent, or $7.185, to $62.1875, in
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. In London, shares of HSBC
fell 2.6 percent, to (PS)7.46, or $12.03.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said they expected that the purchase would be completed
but were concerned that it might drag on for several months. The
two companies had hoped to complete the deal by the end of this
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unlucky timing for HSBC,'' said Simon Samuels, a banking
analyst with Salomon Smith Barney in London. Indeed, earlier this
week, talks between HSBC and the South Korean government for HSBC
to take control of Seoulbank fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the problems that Republic might face, ``the industrial
logic of the deal is very compelling,'' Samuels added. ``It is
likely that it will delay the deal but not scuttle it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation stems from an inspection by Japanese
regulators of a Tokyo office that is affiliated with a client of
Republic's securities unit. Though Republic did not identify the
client, Bloomberg News said Thursday that the client was Princeton
Economics International, a New Jersey company. Princeton Economics
owns Cresvale International Ltd., which specializes in brokering
and underwriting equities and bonds in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Japanese regulators made an unannounced audit of
Cresvale's Tokyo operations as part of a wider scrutiny of foreign
securities firms.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Princeton Economics could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of Princeton Economics is Martin Armstrong, who is
one of the largest individual traders of silver futures on the
Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. He is also
involved in currency hedging in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, who headed the Republic securities unit, had had
previous run-ins with regulators. In February, he agreed to pay the
Securities and Exchange Commission a $25,000 fine over accusations
that the unit had paid rebates to an investment advisory firm. In
settling with the SEC, the Republic unit and Sweeney neither
admitted nor denied the allegations.

BORBON RIDES OUT BUMPY STRETCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Dodgers weren't exactly worried sick that
left-hander Pedro Borbon suddenly couldn't get anyone out, but they
were concerned. The situational lefty out of the bullpen was
perhaps a blown chance away from seeing his role diminish.
</P>
<P>
   Then he blew away Milwaukee lefties Geoff Jenkins and Jeromy
Burnitz in Tuesday's 5-3 win. A big sigh came out of Dodger
Stadium, partly because of Borbon's past. Before stunning everyone
and making the team out of spring training, Borbon hadn't pitched
in the big leagues since 1996 because of elbow surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Borbon, by no means, is saying he's turned the corner and back
to his dominating pre-All-Star break form, when he led the staff
with a 1.64 ERA. But Borbon certainly believes he's done with the
horrific spell in which he had a 10.50 ERA since the break and saw
his ERA rise to 4.00 before his outing against the Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was mental fatigue, but it hasn't been arm fatigue,''
Borbon said. ``It was just a lack of aggressiveness and doubting
myself a little bit. I expected the worst to happen and it did.
It's a lack of confidence. You really expect something bad to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But rarely does something bad happen when Borbon faces
left-handers, who are batting .136 (11 for 81) against him.
Right-handers are hitting .256 (22 for 86). ``I discovered it
wasn't mechanical, it was mental,'' Borbon said. ``I have to go out
and pitch like it's the seventh game of the World Series every
time. I hate to say it, but it shocked me when I didn't succeed. I
hit a bump in the road and I didn't know how to handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rehabbing righties: Dodgers right-handers Robinson Checo and
Antonio Osuna both came out of their rehab appearances Wednesday
with Single-A San Bernardino feeling fine.
</P>
<P>
   Checo, on the disabled list with a groin injury, allowed one hit
and struck out two in two innings of an 11-0 win against San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna, who's spurned a recommendation by Dr. Frank Jobe, struck
out one in a perfect inning of work. Osuna has pitched in five
games this season and had agreed to have reconstructive elbow
surgery before changing his mind a month ago. Osuna is trying to
pitch through a partial tear of a ligament in his elbow. Neither
player is expected to join the Dodgers on the six-game trip that
begins today in Chicago and finishes in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: Not only did the Dodgers draw a
season-low 23,616 for Wednesday's twilight game against Milwaukee,
but the three-game series drew 84,907, an average of 28,302 per
game.... First baseman Eric Karros is on pace to hit 35 homers and
drive in 111 runs. The home runs would be a career-high and the RBI
would tie a career high.

BOEING'S CONDIT STILL LEAVES OPEN THE POSSIBILITY OF FLEXIBLE
WORKWEEK 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SEATTLE _ A day after The Boeing Co. settled its biggest labor
contract, Chairman Phil Condit resurrected one of the thorniest
issues, suggesting the company could boost productivity by
experimenting with flexible workweeks.
</P>
<P>
   Condit envisions pilot projects with the International
Association of Machinists that would introduce alternative
schedules _ under which employees work shorter or longer shifts or
into the weekend _ as part of a broader plan to create a leaner
aerospace company.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of mandatory changes in the workweek was a flash point
during negotiations, and the union threatened to strike if the
company tried to force non-traditional schedules on its members.
</P>
<P>
   Condit, however, wants to ``experiment'' with the idea under a
7-year-old provision that requires both the company and the union
to agree before a schedule is changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can work with the union to say, `OK let's try a
couple ways; let's experiment,''' Condit said Thursday in an
exclusive interview with the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   The union says it simply is not interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members don't want a non-traditional workweek,'' said Bill
Johnson, president of the union's District Lodge 751, which covers
the Puget Sound region. ``It's not an item of discussion. ... There
is no wiggle room on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Condit argued that many workers misunderstand the concept, in
which employees could work their 40-hour weeks in three or four
days, including weekends. They worry the company will force parents
to abandon their children on weekends and create other disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, both sides could discuss pilot projects that
might affect only certain workers and functions and could be
voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   It is ``not that we are going to come roaring in here with a
great big full-blown proposal,'' Condit said.
</P>
<P>
   Altering the work schedule is only one line in Boeing's
blueprint to boost productivity, lower costs and win new airplane
orders. If the company fails, it will cede both customers and jobs
to its Toulouse, France-based rival, Airbus Industrie, Condit said.
</P>
<P>
   The contract, which addressed many of the union's concerns, was
another step in creating a more productive work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means people that you pay well have to be productive in the
context of the business,'' Condit said. ``I want a highly motivated
work force ... excited about what they are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Condit is eager to employ workshops that bring
together Machinists, engineers and others to devise better ways to
build airplanes. Those groups, known as Accelerated Improvement
Workshops, will examine a range of issues, such as why an airplane
part didn't fit initially and why a mechanic was forced to waste
time searching for tools and parts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most important for Condit, and the investors who buy and sell
his company's stock, is that Boeing must become more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   The aerospace giant can't allow planes worth more than $150
million to idle at its plants, as Airbus becomes an increasingly
potent competitor, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A ``747 sitting on the flight line out there is $160 million
worth of stuff, and every day it sits there, we are holding it and
not getting paid for it,'' Condit said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing defused its most explosive labor situation Wednesday,
when Machinists approved Boeing's contract offer, and Condit
attributed much of the success to the fact that both camps have
been talking for two years.
</P>
<P>
   If Machinists had rejected the company's offer Wednesday, they
would have crippled Boeing's production lines as the company
recovered from two years of problems. Instead, workers embraced the
offer, passing it with an 86 percent margin.
</P>
<P>
   Condit made clear that although negotiating a good contract for
the company was important, it will mean little if Boeing isn't
competitive with Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two competitors,'' he said. ``We know who they are.
It's us and them. If we don't get the orders, they do. It's that
simple.''
</P>
<P>
   If Boeing loses to Airbus, nothing in the contract will protect
jobs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we fail to win orders, if we are not competitive with
Airbus, the work here declines,'' he said. ``If we are competitive,
we have a real opportunity to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Condit said it's time that Airbus makes it on its own, without
help from the government subsidies that it has long enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, British Aerospace, one of the four companies
that make up Airbus Industrie, said it had asked Britain's
government for an $800 million loan to help fund its participation
in the A3XX, the planned Airbus superjumbo jetliner that will seat
more passengers than Boeing's 747.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1992 agreement between the United States and European
authorities, the Airbus consortium can get up to 30 percent of a
new plane's development cost from the government.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus has said the A3XX will cost at least $12 billion to
develop, so it stands to get about $3.6 billion from the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has long argued the Airbus subsidies have created an
unfair playing field, and it has urged the U.S. government to try
to prevent subsidies from being used to help develop the A3XX,
which Airbus hopes will drive a stake through Boeing's 747
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to pay it back (government subsidies),'' Condit said
of Airbus, ``but the conditions under which they pay it back are
very different from the world we live in.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than paying back the loan on a fixed rate regardless of
whether the market develops, as Boeing must do when it borrows from
a bank, Airbus pays back government loans when it delivers planes,
Condit said. And if the market does not develop, Airbus is off the
hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changes the fundamental financial equation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Condit said he is encouraged that the World Trade Organization
is moving toward rules-based trade requirements in a global
economy.
</P>
<P>
   `That's what the WTO is all about,'' he said. ``How do you build
a set of rules-based trade requirements that say, `We are going to
live in a global economy and there have to be rules'?
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, the faster we get there, the better
off we are. I'm also not going to stand around and say we can't
compete in the interim, because I think we can.''
</P>
<P>
   On other issues, Condit said:
</P>
<P>
   _He is a little more optimistic than he was about 747
production. Because of the economic downturn in Asia that saw many
airlines in that region delay or cancel orders for widebody jets,
Boeing had warned that production of the 747, the company's most
profitable plane, could be cut to one per month next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's looking better than it did,'' he said. ``I'm not
breathing easy yet, but I'm breathing better.''
</P>
<P>
   Condit said he continues to see signs that the situation in Asia
may be improving.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, China Airlines, Taiwan's largest airline, agreed to
buy 13 747-400 cargo planes for $3.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   _Condit defended his second in command, Boeing President Harry
Stonecipher. Stonecipher was a lightning rod for union members'
criticism during the past two weeks, as they blamed him for many of
the hard-line positions the company took in the early stages of the
contract talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry sometimes gets blamed for things that he had no part at
all in,'' Condit said.
</P>
<P>
   _Condit said the contract represented a new chapter for Boeing,
but added.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't just turn the page, though, and say, `Everything is
now different.' There are opportunities there to work together
productively. And there is an opportunity to fail to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world will continue to change ... it won't look the same
three years from now. ... Airbus will change. We are going to deal
with new designs for airplanes. ... If labor is willing to work
with the company, I think we can be successful. If not, it's likely
that somebody else will get the jobs''
</P>
<P>
   Condit noted that a number of years ago, longshore workers'
union said they would never handle containers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what you discover is that's the only way stuff comes. If
you decide that's too hard, it all goes somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you say, nope, it's better to handle containers and have a
job than to be really strict about this. It's that change that's
always the hard part.''
