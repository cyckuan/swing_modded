TODAY'S PAPERS: PAGE 1 DIGEST FOR OCT. 16. 
</HEADLINE>
  By SCOTT SHUGER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thursday's surprise Federal Reserve interest rate cut leads at
the Washington Post, Los Angeles Times and USA Today. The New York
Times runs the cut as its off-lead and goes instead with the
apparent federal budget deal, which makes everybody else's front.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's cut in two important interest rates came just two
weeks after its previous one, and Wall St. went from ticked about
insufficient credit to upticked _ 330 points to the good on the
day. The rate move, the papers note, was the first one to come
without a regularly scheduled Fed meeting in more than four years.
And, observes the Post, only the second such occurrence since
Greenspan became Fed chairman.
</P>
<P>
   A move without a meeting is taken by the papers to be a sign of
the seriousness of the overall economic environment. (Although the
LAT says there's no evidence that there's any orchestrated rate
cutting by central banks around the world in the offing.) One
economist tells the NYT he's worried that the cut indicates that
some particular bank or investment firm is about to have a big
problem, but the paper says there are no immediate signs of this.
</P>
<P>
   Another economist tells the Wall Street Journal it means that
Fed chairman Alan Greenspan admits he made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The NYT, WP and WSJ explain that Greenspan made the move on his
own authority but after consulting with other Fed officials. The
papers quote experts saying they expect further interest cuts soon.
</P>
<P>
   In its top paragraph, the NYT lead characterizes the new $1.7
trillion federal budget _ expected to pass Friday _ as the first in
three decades with a surplus and as containing the biggest
peacetime increase in military spending since Ronald Reagan was
president (complete, the NYT notices, with an aircraft carrier
contract for Trent Lott's hometown, and a cargo plane contract for
Newt Gingrich's.) The Times lists what it considers the budget's
leading features: money for hiring 100,000 new teachers, relief for
farmers, more than $2 billion in basic medical research funds,
funds for U.S. troops in Bosnia, tightening security at U.S.
embassies, replenishing the IMF, and sending food to North Korea.
Another done deal: federal health plans will now be required to
provide contraceptive coverage for federal employees,
</P>
<P>
   The paper also describes this piece of Congressional budget
reasoning: ``(B)ecause of the killing of two Capitol Hill police
officers earlier this year, it provides $200 million to develop a
visitor center to more easily control entry into the Capitol and a
tightening of security at the Capitol and the Library of
Congress.'' Only in Washington would it cost $100 million to (not)
save a cop's life.
</P>
<P>
   The WP reports that Trent Lott got a provision written into the
budget bill that extends the duck hunting season in Mississippi,
but never explains how a federal bill could do that.
</P>
<P>
   The Times lead (ditto the Times lead editorial) says the
resolution of the budget wrangle was a big victory for President
Clinton, who showed he can still influence Congress even while it's
considering impeaching him. Was Clinton apologizing yet again when
he said, ``''Just think what we could do for America if we had
these priorities all year long, instead of just for eight days''?
</P>
<P>
   The WP editorial on the budget manages not to feel Clinton's
gain, saying of all the players: ``They reached belated agreement
on a single massive bill that takes the place of eight lesser bills
they should have passed earlier. They achieved the agreement in
part by bending the budget rules. The omnibill contains something
extra for everyone. The extra spending will eat up about a quarter
of the vaunted budget surplus projected for the fiscal year just
begun.'' The wry headline over the editorial: ``Big Deal.''
</P>
<P>
   USAT features a big front-page ``cover story'' ramping up to the
beginning Monday of the government antitrust suit against
Microsoft. The story quotes Bill Gates' recent assessment of the
government's case: ``I'm not worried about it at all.'' The story
mentions but does not explain two things that are a bit puzzling:
1) Why won't Gates be called to testify? and 2) Why is there still
a case concerning browsers and Windows 98, when last June a federal
appeals court backed the company in a case involving browsers and
Windows 95?
</P>
<P>
   The WSJ also does a good story on the case, mentioning along the
way that the trial judge has implied he thinks the case is headed
to the appeals court over him, while one of the lawyers for the
states in the case says it's going to the Supreme Court.

 &HT;    NAME GAME: WHAT WILL THE NEXT DECADE BE CALLED?
 &HT;    350&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (l) lifestyle categories.

   WASHINGTON _ How about the ``Naughties?''
</P>
<P>
   Or is it ``Noughties?'' Spelling is only one complication of the
coming linguistic crisis: What will we call the next decade?
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, that's a good question,'' said Gerald Celente, director of
the Trends Research Institute and a futurist paid to ponder such
imponderables. ``Looking at the scope of the whole new millennium,
this will be the Starter Decade. I'd call it the 'First Decade.'
That's the way it will be looked at.''
</P>
<P>
   But somehow the ``Sixth Decade'' doesn't inspire images of
protests and Vietnam and bell-bottoms and Beatles like ``the
Sixties'' does. Think of the Thirties, and the Great Depression
comes to mind. For Baby Boomers, the Fifties will always conjure up
memories of Howdy Doody and Elvis and Ike.
</P>
<P>
   So be it the ``Naughts'' or the ``Oh Ohs'' or the ``Aughts'' or
the ``Zeroes'' or the ``Pre-Teens,'' the years 2000 to 2009 will
have to be called something.
</P>
<P>
   Well, what did Americans dub the first decade of the 20th
century?
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't any widely applied nickname, said Kenneth
Cmiel(cq), a professor of cultural history at the University of
Iowa and the author of ``Democratic Eloquence,'' a book on American
language.
</P>
<P>
   ``The naming of decades is a 20th-century thing that begins in
the 1930s,'' when folks looked back longingly on the ``roaring
Twenties,'' he explained. Four decades had passed before the 1890s
acquired the ``Gay Nineties'' moniker.
</P>
<P>
   The naming of decades came about as people began thinking in
shorter time frames, said Cmiel. And some of the 20th century's
momentous events _ the stock market crashed in 1929; World War II
began in 1939 _ divided history fairly neatly into decades.
</P>
<P>
   Decadism has also been boosted by recurring nostalgia fads, said
Cmiel. This began in the early 1970s with the movie ``American
Graffiti'' and the TV show ``Happy Days,'' and the time frame is
now so compressed that a movie like ``The Wedding Singer'' can look
back fondly at the Eighties.
</P>
<P>
   As to what to call the next decade, though, Cmiel concedes, ``I
have no clue.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if this problem sneaked up on a
vocabulary-challenged nation. Way back on May 7, 1989, the ``On
Language'' column of New York Times writer William Safire asked the
key question: ``What are we going to call the decade after the
decade of the Nineties?''
</P>
<P>
   Safire's readers suggested ``the Aughties'' or ``the Double
Naughties'' or ``the Zeroes,'' but no consensus was reached. More
recently, on the Internet, Joe Lavin's Humor Column conducted an
online survey and came up with advocates for ``the Ohs'' and the
``Uh Ohs'' and ``the Naughty Aughts.''
</P>
<P>
   There does seem to be some literary precedence for the
``Aughts''. In ``The Music Man,'' Professor Harold Hill claimed to
be a graduate of the Gary Conservatory, Class of Aught Five.
</P>
<P>
   However, the dictionary declares that ``aught'' is a corruption
of the term ``naught.'' Editorializing on this issue, The New York
Times opined that calling the decade ``the Aughts'' would be like
calling this publication ``an ewspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the term ``naught'' has an archaic air about it, and
worse, is defined as ``nothing'' or ``inconsequential'' _ hardly
desirable for the opening decade of a brand new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a spelling quandary. Is it ``Naught'' or
``Nought?'' ``Aught'' or ``Ought?'' Dictionaries list all the
versions.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post recently launched a contest to name the
decade, concluding with ``In the true spirit of the oughts, the
prize is nought.''
</P>
<P>
   A computer search on the topic turned up suggested decade names
of the Zips, the Zeds, the Zeroes, the Zilches, the Nadas and the
Nils _ which share the shortcoming that they all essentially mean
``the Nothings.'' Nobody will want to grow up during the Nadas.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times editorialized in favor of the ``Ohs.''
Indeed, a radio station in 2525 might well specialize in ``Golden
Oldies from the Ohs.'' And every year in the decade will contain
some ``Ohs.'' Calling the decade the ``Oh Ohs'' might offend
purists who would point out that the first year, 2000, is really an
``Oh Oh Oh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose you have to call it 'the Units','' Merriam-Webster
Dictionary editor Fred Mish told the Boston Globe. ``I don't know
what else you would use between zero and ten. Then, of course,
we're off the hook, since everyone can agree on the teens.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh-oh. What about 2011 and 2012?

 &HT;    'DO-NOTHING CONGRESS' DID MORE THAN SOME RECALL
 &HT;    With CLINTON-CONGRESS.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Before ending in a pre-election flurry of budget
compromises and partisan jabs, this ``do-nothing Congress'' did
more than a lot of people recall.
</P>
<P>
   The most upbeat evaluation of the 105th Congress, which met for
far fewer days and passed far fewer laws than the average Congress
before it, came from House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first Congress since the 1920s to deliver a projected
10 years of a balanced budget _ a $1.6 trillion surplus over the
next 10 years,'' Gingrich said, ``setting the stage for us to come
back next year in a bipartisan way and save Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   The most scorching assessment came from his Democratic
counterpart, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-S.D., who
recalled that his fellow Missourian, President Harry Truman, had
excoriated the 80th Congress as the ``Do-Nothing Congress'' in
1948.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Congress would make the 80th Congress look energetic and
effective,'' Gephardt said. ``They did rename (Washington's)
National Airport for Ronald Reagan, if you think that's an
important thing to have accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said, ``''I think it is their desire to please special
interests that has kept them from bring up the patient's bill of
rights, kept them from bringing up tobacco legislation and
(Democratic) education legislation, and interested them in a tax
cut when they should have been saving the money for Social Security
first.''
</P>
<P>
   The actual record of the Republican-controlled Congress, as it
alternated between cooperation and confrontation with the
Democratic White House, supports both Gingrich's and Gephardt's
views.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, President Clinton and Congress did indeed put off
action on some complex legislative dilemmas, including badly needed
new regulatory methods of dealing with the dangerously
fast-changing world of banks, investments and electric utilities.
</P>
<P>
   But that year they also agreed on a bipartisan five-year plan
that slowed the pace of projected spending increases by enough to
balance the federal budget for the first time in three decades. If
the nation never has another recession, even Gingrich's highly
unlikely dream of pain-free cures for Social Security's problems
could come true.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, they also adopted $95 billion in net tax cuts _ the
first tax bill since 1981 to contain more cuts than increases. It
included credits of $500 a child for families and lower tax rates
on estates and capital gains, as well as enough narrowly targeted
tax breaks to add 285 sections and 824 amendments to the U.S. tax
code.
</P>
<P>
   This year, of course, Congress killed the national tobacco
settlement and campaign finance reforms favored by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But together they also agreed on a bipartisan plan to overhaul
the Internal Revenue Service. They hope it will keep the IRS from
irritating taxpayers or treading on their rights while enforcing
the more complex tax code.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and Clinton this year also agreed on less publicized,
but potentially significant laws: job-training revisions, an
overhaul of low-income housing programs, and a humongous injection
of funds into highways and mass transit.
</P>
<P>
   Though they couldn't compete for headlines with congressional
action on the ethics of Gingrich in 1997 and of Clinton in 1998,
those low-profile laws adopted by big, bipartisan votes could
change life for millions of American workers, poor families and
commuters in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   This year's major reforms included:
</P>
<P>
   _ Job-training revisions. Ending a six-year stalemate over how
to fix federal job-training programs so diverse that nobody even
checked to see which ones were effective, Congress and the
administration agreed on a law simplifying the programs, giving
state and local officials more autonomy, and building in some
monitoring programs designed to find out which methods work best.
</P>
<P>
   _ Low-income housing overhaul. Three years of agonizing
negotiations between the Senate, the House and the White House
resulted in a 400-page law that retiring Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy,
D-Mass., described as ``the first major overhaul of the public
housing of this country in 60 years.'' As an alternative to using
public housing to warehouse the poorest of the poor, the bill
phases in programs that reward work by subsidized tenants, and
gives local officials more flexibility in programs designed to
provide affordable apartments to poor people or help them pay their
rent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Highways and mass transit. The six-year surface transportation
bill, guaranteeing each state at least 90.5 cents for each dollar
raised by federal gasoline taxes within its boundaries, allocates
$216 billion. That included a record $12 billion for bus and rail
projects and $9 billion for ``pork barrel'' projects specified by
individual members of Congress.

   MINTER-COLUMN _ The way you go to a Georgia football game in
Baton Rouge is first you fly to New Orleans and spend Friday night
barking on Bourbon Street. Then you take a bus and a box lunch the
rest of the way. If Quincy Carter is perfect and Champ Bailey is
sensational, as they were, you can do some more barking in Baton
Rouge, which is French for Red Stick. Although I'm a loyal Bulldog
fan I have trouble being a comfortable barker, even on Bourbon
Street. I'm a little self-conscious yelling ``How 'Bout them
Dawgs!'' while high-fiving a perfect stranger. (Minter, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). MOVED

   BKCHOI _ ATLANTA _ The curse and the blessing of the South is
that it functions as a sort of national theater, acting out the
subjects _ race, history, class _ that the rest of the country
assumes immunity from. While mainstream America cheerfully
dismisses the past as irrelevant, the South is still the designated
land of suffering, poverty, prejudice: America's ``old country.''
While these powerful images may be, by now, gross stereotyping,
their core truth feeds Southern writers on a rich diet of subtlety,
profundity and irony lacking in other American fiction, say, the
Updike school of high WASP suffering or the McInerneyesque
chronicles of People magazine partygoing. So it's good to report
that Susan Choi believes in the old-time religion of William
Faulkner, Ralph Ellison and Eudora Welty. Her first novel is a
strong, graceful piece of prose that stirs war, love, class and
culture together in a strange and beautiful alchemy. (Roberts,

 &HT;    `Foreign Student' strong novel that stirs war, love, class,
culture
 &HT;    By Diane Roberts
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The curse and the blessing of the South is that it
functions as a sort of national theater, acting out the subjects _
race, history, class _ that the rest of the country assumes
immunity from. While mainstream America cheerfully dismisses the
past as irrelevant, the South is still the designated land of
suffering, poverty, prejudice: America's ``old country.''
</P>
<P>
   While these powerful images may be, by now, gross stereotyping,
their core truth feeds Southern writers on a rich diet of subtlety,
profundity and irony lacking in other American fiction, say, the
Updike school of high WASP suffering or the McInerneyesque
chronicles of People magazine partygoing. So it's good to report
that Susan Choi believes in the old-time religion of William
Faulkner, Ralph Ellison and Eudora Welty. Her first novel is a
strong, graceful piece of prose that stirs war, love, class and
culture together in a strange and beautiful alchemy.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of ``The Foreign Student'' conjures the sort of
mythic dream time Faulkner raises in ``Absalom, Absalom'' or Welty
evokes in her Morgana stories, the never-never ``before the war''
when rich families closed up their townhouses and moved to their
country estates. Only this is not Jefferson or Jackson but Seoul,
and the war is the Korean War. Chang ``Chuck'' Ahn is the child of
privileged Koreans who lose everything in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Barely surviving the ravages of the civil war, in 1955 Chuck
manages to escape on a church scholarship to the University of the
South in Sewanee, Tenn. There he meets Katherine Monroe, the child
of privileged Southerners who is trapped in a destructive
relationship with a dilettante professor. Chang and Katherine are
hurt, haunted people who manage, almost blindly, to come together
and heal each other.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Choi was born in Indiana and raised in Texas, and her
father was Korean. So who knows if she defines herself as
``Southern''? But in this work she is helping to reinvent ``the
Southern novel'' for the new millennium. She explores race and
class, but bypasses the expected avenues of Jim Crow, shack
dwellers and white columns in favor of looking at the South through
the eyes of a man who has no purchase on its magisterial systems of
prejudice. The South in the mid-1950s was working itself into a
decadelong series of explosions, but Choi resists the temptation to
overcontextualize her story. Chuck does not understand much of what
he sees. Sewanee, that double shrine to plantation-caste
Episcopalianism and the Lost Cause, is just a beautiful opportunity
to him. His civil war, his ruined lands, are behind him in Korea.
But in inviting the comparison, Choi slyly makes the South and the
great Southern obsession _ memory _ fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck is the most compelling character in the novel: intricately
realized, constantly surprising, struggling for survival both in
Korea and in the United States. But maybe Choi exhausted herself in
creating him _ Katherine is at best enigmatic, at worst
two-dimensional. While she certainly militates against the
stereotype of the ``Southern belle,'' the creature of white gloves
and empty-headed grace her mother wishes her to be, her spikiness
and eccentricity read like decoration. Her motives and her feelings
remain opaque.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Foreign Student'' isn't exactly a love story, even though
Katherine and Chuck, two exiles, are strongly drawn to each other
in their loneliness. It's definitely a story about the
paradoxically crushing and liberating qualities of memory _ how the
weight of the past can warp the present.
</P>
<P>
   Choi is not quite in control of her ambitious material and her
potentially complex characters. But she writes with an authority
and tough beauty astonishing in a first novel. At times, she sounds
very much like Faulkner:
</P>
<P>
   ``He had thought he would always have two things, the great
space within him where his home had to live, and that diminishment,
when his body had imploded. Between the two, the excess of memory
and its absence, was left a story he couldn't describe. But the
story had begun to circumvent these difficulties. It grew shorter
and simpler. It would close around that event as his memory had
closed around the torture and his body around the wound, and,
constricting, leave no absence behind.''
</P>
<P>
   The South is not, of course, an ancient culture the way Korea
is, but it is America's land of memory. Choi has elegantly and
profoundly tied these two bleeding lands together in a novel that
forces us to see old landscapes anew.

 &HT;    Next thing you know, they'll be making round footballs
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since my wife, aka Mrs. Christopher Columbus, never misses a
chance to tack on a few frequent flyer points, we took a Delta
peanut and pretzel flight to watch our University of Georgia
student-athletes do battle with Louisiana State's student-athletes
in Baton Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   The way you go to a Georgia football game in Baton Rouge is
first you fly to New Orleans and spend Friday night barking on
Bourbon Street. Then you take a bus and a box lunch the rest of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   If Quincy Carter is perfect and Champ Bailey is sensational, as
they were, you can do some more barking in Baton Rouge, which is
French for Red Stick. Although I'm a loyal Bulldog fan I have
trouble being a comfortable barker, even on Bourbon Street. I'm a
little self-conscious yelling ``How 'Bout them Dawgs!'' while
high-fiving a perfect stranger.
</P>
<P>
   I'd hate for Mrs. Cole to hear me using bad English while
representing my university in public. I know I'd be in big trouble
with my former boss in the Atlanta Journal sports department.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was suspected of Georgia Tech leanings, Colonel Ed
Danforth, when he was sports editor, wouldn't let us use ``Dogs''
for Bulldogs even when we needed to shorten a headline. He
contended that student-athletes representing a state university
deserved more dignity.
</P>
<P>
   The next time Quincy Carter throws a sizzling touchdown pass to
one of his fellow student-athletes I'm going to high-five somebody
and yell: ``How about those Bulldogs! Woof! Woof!''
</P>
<P>
   College football has changed a bit now that stadiums can seat
the combined populations of Macon and Columbus. Ladies wear cutoffs
and bikini halters instead of church clothes, and professional
baseball players play quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I like to visit Baton Rouge. It's a throwback to
another era. Or was. Even Saturday night in Baton Rouge has
changed. The LSU defenders who called themselves Chinese Bandits
would be politically incorrect today. Mike the Tiger has lost his
voice.
</P>
<P>
   Before tickets cost half a car payment and 6-foot-2, 255 pounds
wasn't too small for a lineman, before The Swamp, Death Valley and
Between the Hedges _ Saturday night in Baton Rouge was the snakepit
of college football.
</P>
<P>
   While other campuses were happy with crowds of 30,000 to 40,000,
the LSU stadium seated 70,000. The way it got to be so over-sized
for the era was because Huey Long was governor of Louisiana and a
football fan.
</P>
<P>
   The Kingfish decided the university needed more dormitories,
which unlike stadiums, are built with taxpayer dollars. The
dormitories he built at LSU just happened to have 70,000 football
seats leaning against their backside. In order to fill the stadium
they had to sell about 50,000 ``family seats'' at $1 a head. Then
they had to play night games so 50,000 Cajuns would have time to
finish their shift, get drunk, and drive their pickups to the game.
Saturday Night in Baton Rouge with all those screaming Cajuns and
Mike the Tiger roaring became the most dreaded stop in college
football.
</P>
<P>
   They kept Mike, a huge Bengal, in a cage near the visiting
players' tunnel. His cage had a microphone. When visiting teams
trotted out on the field the LSU cheerleaders tapped Mike with an
electric cattle prod. Mike let out a terrible roar, and drunk
Cajuns screamed. It was terrifying. One Saturday night Coach Bobby
Dodd invited me to join him when his Georgia Tech team took the
field. It scared me, and I didn't have to play.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't hear anything from Mike on our latest visit to Baton
Rouge. I understand his role has been eliminated by the Society for
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. If Huey Long were still governor
this couldn't have happened. The Kingfish would find a loophole.
When Ringling Bros. circus scheduled a Saturday night opening in
Baton Rouge, threatening to siphon off the football crowd, Gov.
Long reminded circus officials of the Louisiana Dipping Law
requiring all animals to be submerged in an antiseptic before
crossing the state line. Faced with the sudden task of dipping
lions, tigers and elephants, the circus had to punt.
</P>
<P>
   College football is an interesting business. I've often wondered
what someone opening a time capsule several thousand years from now
would think of newspaper headlines in football season: Georgia Tech
Explodes. Wildcats Devour Tigers. Georgia Bombs LSU. How 'Bout Them
Dawgs!
</P>
<P>
   When we were all worked up earlier in the century after Georgia
beat Notre Dame for a national championship, a man from Stockbridge
wrote to ask if it was really better than when he gathered his
Scout troop on Saturday mornings and drove the boys over to Athens
so they could usher in Sanford Stadium and see the game for free.
</P>
<P>
   College football, like everything else, barely favors what it
used to be.

 &HT;    `Apt Pupil' director Bryan Singer is committed to original ideas
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If anyone has doubted the cultlike fascination
``The Usual Suspects'' exerted on a generation of teen and
twenty-something film dweebs, they need only to have witnessed the
scene in the lobby of the Paramount last Thursday after the
screening of Bryan Singer's latest flick, ``Apt Pupil.'' The dweebs
_ starry eyes, goatees, baseballs caps and all _ were out in force
pinning against a table the lionized director of ``Usual Suspects
.'' For a full 40 minutes he fielded queries like a Real Nice Guy,
as he signed random pieces of paper and was X-rayed in the bleached
lightning of cheap cameras.
</P>
<P>
   This is what happens when you're an impossibly young and hugely
successful director of hip, violent and overly clever crime
thrillers. This is what happened to Quentin Tarantino. And, a
little later, what happened to the 32-year-old Singer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Usual Suspects,'' filmed when Singer was 28, was a solid
box-office success and landed its screenwriter, Christopher
McQuarrie, and supporting actor Kevin Spacey Academy Awards in
1995. Its stylish bravado _ testosteronic bloodletting, flashy
visuals, hairpin structure _ marked the arrival of an audacious new
filmmaker. (Singer's first feature was 1992's ``Public Access.'')
</P>
<P>
   Opening Oct. 23, ``Apt Pupil'' is Singer's long-awaited
follow-up. It's a creepy thriller based on the Stephen King novella
about a teen-ager (Brad Renfro) who blackmails an elderly Nazi war
criminal named Kurt Dussander (Ian McKellan) who's been living
incognito in town. The screenplay is by first-time scripter Brandon
Boyce.
</P>
<P>
   When his fans finally cleared, Singer sprung atop the counter of
the Par- amount bar, where he sat cross-legged and talked briefly
about ``Pupil'' and his current project, ``The X-Men,'' which is
based on the comic book.
</P>
<P>
   He was also forthcoming about the well-publicized controversy
that tainted the production of ``Apt Pupil.'' A group of underage
actors filed a lawsuit alleging that Singer's crew forced them to
get completely naked for a shower scene, which is illegal under
child labor laws. The teen-age actors and their parents are suing
Singer and TriStar Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   A diminutive man, whose fierce blue eyes accent a feline
intensity, Singer wore a black velour shirt, blue jeans and
tennies. He looked no older than 22. No older than many of his
die-hard fans. Q: What attracted you to ``Apt Pupil''? A: Well, the
idea that this awful thing that happened so long ago, the way
Stephen King viewed it as a collective evil, almost like a golem,
almost like a monster in itself and how it crept through the
decades into contemporary society. That interested me, and how it
manifested itself in this young boy through (the character)
Dussander. I found that fascinating. It was a real horror film as
opposed to a supernatural one, though I do love supernatural horror
films. My favorite horror film is by far ``The Exorcist.'' This is
a horror film to me; a more psychological horror film. If you had
to coin a new phrase, you could perhaps call it a ``social horror
film.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think it's risky at this point in your career to
continue to work with first-time writers?
</P>
<P>
   A: I have faith in people and my abil- ity to work with writers.
I work very closely with writers from page one. I think Brandon
exhibited himself well in the prose he had written and his overall
intelligence as a human being, and I had faith that he could write
the script. Ultimately he wrote some scenes and we did some work
together on spec so we could establish that it was possible.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You knew Brandon before this?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've known Brandon since he was 11 years old. He was my
family's paper boy. He was delivering newspapers one day, and we
struck up a friendship when I was very young. We fell out of touch
for about six years when he moved, and then he popped up at USC
while I was attending school there. We ran into each other in a
dining hall and we struck up a more real friendship and have been
friends ever since. I have two best friends in my life, and one of
them is Brandon.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you guys do film stuff as kids?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah, he's acted in many films I did, as a kid in New Jersey,
and then he co-starred with Ethan Hawke (a close friend of
Singer's) in my short film ``Lion's Den.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How does ``The X-Men'' fit into your vision as a director?
</P>
<P>
   A: Again, it's a very original idea and original concept and a
very effective and important one. It's all about the
disenfranchised , people who are looking for an identity, a place
in the world, and are trying to find it amidst prejudice. I think
it's an important concept, yet it's presented in a comic-book
universe, which allows it to reach so many young people, and that's
a key audience for that kind of ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's your take on the on-set controversy surrounding ``Apt
Pupil''?
</P>
<P>
   A: My opinion is it was a group of people who saw this as an
opportunity to make quick money in a quick settlement from a very
wealthy studio and made a mistake, because the studio had no
interest in settling. It understood completely that absolutely
nothing had gone on inappropriately, esp- ecially in front of the
60 people who were there, including a state-appointed social worker
who was there the entire time. I find it odd that these people are
suing when they came back to work the following day and the day
after.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where does the suit stand now?
</P>
<P>
   A: Criminally, it's completely thrown out. The DA interviewed
everyone and did a thorough investigation and threw it completely
out. It lingers as a civil suit, but most of that civil suit _ the
initial and highly inflammatory, highly malicious civil suit _ has
been dismissed by the judge as well, and elements of that suit
continue to be dismissed, so at some point it may not exist at all.
</P>
<P>
   Q: As a young filmmaker with three finished films, do you have
any idea where you're going with your career, what kind of body of
work you're trying to forge?
</P>
<P>
   A: Just original movies, original ideas. When I say original I
don't mean my ideas, I mean things we haven't seen before. Now,
they may incorporate things we have seen before _ we've seen film
noir, we've seen bits and pieces of this movie. But the idea of a
child blackmailing a Nazi to hear of his past, or the idea of five
criminals who end up being the figment of some guy's perpetuation
of his own myth, or X-Men, a group of reluctant superheroes, you
know, they're all very unique, very special. They're not cast from
molds that we've seen before.

 &HT;    John Glenn braces for his last adventure in space
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ From Friendship to Discovery, John Glenn has
been an American hero for more than three decades. Television was
there to beam his first space journey home to us, and it will be
there to record his last.
</P>
<P>
   As Glenn, 77, prepares to blast off Oct. 29 for a nine-day
mission aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery, television welcomes
back 81-year-old Walter Cronkite, the veteran newsman who covered
Glenn's first mission aboard Friendship 7 in 1962. Cronkite will
co-anchor CNN's coverage of the mission with Miles O'Brien, from
beginning to end, in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I'm delighted John is getting the flight,'' Cronkite
said in a phone call from New York before heading to Texas for his
first live broadcast since a '91 shuttle launch. ``But as I told
him, it's most unfair. I'm older than he is, and if they want to
test old age in space, I'm the one to send up there.''
</P>
<P>
   These two senior citizens, Glenn, a Democratic U.S. senator from
Ohio, and Cronkite, a retired CBS news anchor with a passion for
space, represent more than nostalgia. They represent a renewed
interest in exploration and adventure beyond earth, as well as
television's revived interest in covering it all live. And perhaps
the two men remind us of pride, patriotism and happier times.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the attention we're giving this flight, the hope is we
can re-ignite the public's interest in space flight,'' said
Cronkite. ``The public has become blase(accent). Shuttle launches
have become so routine they're scarcely covered by the press, but
we have an opportunity here to remind people we're out there in
space. NASA accepted John Glenn's mission for the same purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewers can expect lots of live coverage on all the news
networks for the scheduled 1 p.m. lift-off on Oct. 29 and for the
Nov. 7 return. In between, the astronaut team aboard Discovery will
transmit live broadcasts daily. Cable networks such as CNN and
MSNBC will carry them live; the broadcast networks likely will
excerpt the space telecasts on their evening newscasts and
newsmagazines. Live from orbit
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the things that's different for Glenn's mission
this time _ live pictures from space,'' said Bill Wheatley, vice
president of NBC News. ``And up-to-date graphics. But I think the
approach, in many ways, will be similar. You've got a rocket going
up in space from the Cape, and we're all going to follow the
count-down and lift-off.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cronkite sees a world of difference between this month's
mission coverage and his early days covering NASA rocket launches
for CBS radio and, later, for CBS television. In the late '50s, the
press wasn't allowed on Cape Canaveral in Florida so Cronkite
watched from a jetty, ``getting chewed up by mosquitoes up top and
rattlesnakes below,'' he said chuckling. Later, he graduated to
reporting from the back of his station wagon and finally, in the
'60s, to a trailer on the Cape. For the upcoming Glenn mission,
he'll be ensconced in relative luxury at Mission Control Center in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing a lot of homework just trying to catch up,'' said
Cronkite. ``All I've got is a lot of memories, so I'm trying to get
up to speed on the shuttle program. . . . I flunked my first year
of physics at the University of Texas, so I've always had a lot to
overcome preparing for these things.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a buzz about this mission we haven't heard in a long
time. NASA has been swamped with requests for media credentials.
Spokesman Doug Peterson said NASA has received more than 2,000 such
requests from journalists worldwide who want to cover the mission,
either from the control center in Houston or from the launch site
at Cape Canaveral. Last week NASA averaged a call every 10 minutes
from news organizations wanting an astronaut to provide commentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody sees a little bit of their own history in
John Glenn,'' NASA's Peterson said. ``And kids, there's a
tremendous interest among kids, who always seem to be turned on by
space. There's just been incredible interest in this flight.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of space travel, Americans were captivated by
the idea of going to the heavens, and when man set foot on the
moon, the world was transfixed by the grainy images and scratchy
audio . . . ``That's one small step for man, one giant leap for
mankind.'' The moon landing in the summer of '69 remains one of the
most-watched news events of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much was coming together in the '60s,'' said Robert
Thompson, director of the Center for the Study of Popular
Television at Syracuse University. ``There was a revolutionary new
mind-set. Not only was the space program new, but it was covered by
a medium that was new. It was a fascinating period for space and
TV. . . . The awe was not only that we were firing people into
orbit, but that television was letting us watch it. It was a
delightfully naive, jaw-dropping period.''
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, space travel and television grew up together; now
both, in many respects, are taken for granted. Space was the
future, the place to be, and TV was the miracle medium that would
entertain us, inform us and take us to the moon.
</P>
<P>
   But over the years, space flight has become ordinary, and
television technology is no longer new. In fact, TV technology is
primitive compared to computers.
</P>
<P>
   The Challenger disaster in 1986 sparked renewed interest for a
time, after the inspirational sight of schoolteacher Christa
McAuliffe soaring into space turned into a horror witnessed by
millions of children. And the Mars Pathfinder mission last year,
with the little Sojourner robot crawling over red-dirt hills,
attracted us briefly.
</P>
<P>
   On the entertainment front, Tom Hanks' movie ``Apollo 13'' and
his HBO docudrama ``From the Earth to the Moon'' were wildly
popular.
</P>
<P>
   But lift-offs and splash-downs are rarely covered live by TV
news any more. Missions come and go with only 30-second blips on
the evening news. NASA press conferences often attract only a
handful of journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Until now. Positive programming
</P>
<P>
   As the first American to orbit the earth prepares to return to
space, TV cameras have followed his training and will follow him
into space.
</P>
<P>
   Why has Glenn's return to space so captivated the American
public?
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, it's John Glenn,'' said NBC's Wheatley.
``He's 77 years old, one of the most famous Americans. He's a
remarkable story, highly inspirational, and that adds a little
romance to the topic.''
</P>
<P>
   And we shouldn't discount the timing. We had a long spring and
hot summer filled with depressing, distasteful news from
Washington. People are hungry for good news and inspiring stories.
Home-run sluggers Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa lifted our spirits
for a time, and now we have Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a perfect bit of counter-programming for the culture
right now,'' Thompson said. ``In many ways, we're seeing more a
sense of nostalgia. It's this great story of one of the guys who
started it all going up again.''
</P>
<P>
   But some believe we may never see the kind of enthusiasm for
space we had in the early days. Another manned mission to the moon
might get our attention, but possibly not in the breathtaking way
it did in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea of going to the heavens, of reaching into
space, was a remarkable concept in the '60s _ on a par with the
great explorers exploring the continents,'' said NBC's Wheatley.
``But once some of those basics were accomplished, concepts like
the shuttle had far less romance.'' Space travel, the sequel
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more cynical is Thompson's comparison of the Glenn
mission covered by Cronkite to TV recycling old shows such as
``Fantasy Island.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, one sees the space program going the same route
as entertainment genres, going back to what worked before,
Hollywood making films about old TV shows and TV making remakes of
old TV shows,'' Thompson said. ``It's almost like this is the
greatest hits of the space program. The cloud that seems to be all
over this is we are so much in this culture of recycling, renewal
and nostalgia.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cronkite firmly believes space exploration is the biggest
story of the 20th century, and he hopes the return of Glenn, along
with television's decision to beam the journey live, will remind
people of our past and future as travelers in the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Space is one of the great challenges we still face, our last
frontier,'' he said softly. ``I can't imagine anyone not being
excited about it. It's our last great adventure.''

 &HT;    Six-hour documentary on American's journey through slavery
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ How did a nation based on the concept of liberty
and justice for all come to justify the existence of slavery? This
mysterious paradox has puzzled and troubled us for generations.
</P>
<P>
   PBS's new 6-hour documentary series ``Africans in America:
America's Journey Through Slavery'' explores this difficult topic
through innovative historical research, personal stories and superb
filmmaking. The result is compelling television that peels back the
layers of America's ongoing struggle with racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we realize that we've spent more time as a people with
slavery than without it, we can begin to see it as a centerpiece of
our national identity,'' said executive producer Orlando Bagwell,
whose credits include ``Eyes on the Prize,'' ``Malcolm X: Make It
Plain'' and ``The Great Depression.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this is not a black history or a white history, but
a story that explores how white and black slavery and freedom are
connected at the hip. It's a story of our common pasts. ... It is a
uniquely American story. If we recognize our shared history, then
we're on the road to reconciling racial divisiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   The first episode, which airs tonight, focuses on the origins of
one of the largest forced migrations in recorded history. After the
arrival of the first Africans in Virginia in the early 1600s, the
groundwork for a system of racial slavery was established by
British colonists. In the second episode, the film juxtaposes the
colonists' revolt against the British with the seeds of revolt by
the slaves.
</P>
<P>
   The third and fourth episodes explores in depth the growing
revolutionary spirit among slaves and abolitionists through the
first 50 years of the new nation and concludes with the tensions
that exploded into the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed on location in 12 states and three continents, ``Africans
in America'' uses a combination of first-person narratives,
interviews with historians and descendants of slaves and richly
evocative music. The soundtrack is from Bernice Johnson Reagon ,
founder of Sweet Honey in the Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Visually the story is told through the filmed interviews,
drawings and a few photos, as well as some artfully filmed new
footage, including scenes of a 17th-century ship bobbing in the
ocean, the African and American countryside and historic buildings
such as Mount Vernon.
</P>
<P>
   Slavery is a wrenching topic that has been explored before, but
Bagwell's documentary is the most complete record since Alex
Haley's autobiographical novel ``Roots.'' An educational outreach
program, including lessons, tapes and computer programs, is being
sponsored by PBS.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Johnson, author of ``Dream'' and ``Middle Passage,''
wrote a companion book for the series that includes 12 short
stories. Using fiction to provide easier access to history has been
used effectively many times, and Johnson, who also is interviewed
in the program, believes the one-two punch adds impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it might take time to move forward, because you can't
block out how we got to this moment in time,'' Johnson said. ``We
have to fully understand that history and its complexity and the
participation of all kinds of people who made this nation what it
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the existing research on the subject, it's not surprising
that there are few historical discoveries. Nevertheless, Bagwell
hopes his fresh and thorough treatment will dispel at least one
common misconception.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the very beginning, there was no slavery in the North
American colonies,'' he said. ``In the beginning, there were no
laws that governed this idea of servitude. Only gradually did
slavery become a reality in Virginia and the other 13 colonies.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the program, many Africans arrived as indentured
servants, along with many white indentured servants. Later
legalized, life-long slavery became associated exclusively with
people of color.
</P>
<P>
   One of several descendants of slaves interviewed for the program
is Karen Hughes White, who researched her family roots to Virginia
and to slaves owned by Thomas Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept meticulous records, so I was able to find out all of
the transactions from his farm accounts,'' White told reporters in
an interview. Like other proud African-Americans whose history
coincides with our founding fathers, White is philosophical about
the people who bought and sold her ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jefferson was a man of his time,'' White said. ``You can't
change that, but you can accept it for what it is. We are all
Americans, and we are products of slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``Africans in America'' takes pains to point out that
all of us, black and white, have been affected by our history of
slavery, adding to tensions that continue today.
</P>
<P>
   After spending nearly a decade researching and planning his
documentary, Bagwell said he found the creation of institutional
slavery in this country depressing, but he also found reason for
hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look not just at the evolution of slavery but how it became
an entrenched part of society,'' Bagwell said. ``And that goes
along with certain ideas about whiteness as well as blackness.
These ideas of race are things we construct, and that was the most
interesting and surprising element for me in doing the research. I
realized that this is something we have constructed, and therefore
there's also the possibility of deconstructing it.''

 &HT;    'DO-NOTHING CONGRESS' DID MORE THAN SOME RECALL
 &HT;    Removes reference to Gephardt in graf 4 as D-S.D.
 &HT;    With CLINTON-CONGRESS.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Before ending in a pre-election flurry of budget
compromises and partisan jabs, this ``do-nothing Congress'' did
more than a lot of people recall.
</P>
<P>
   The most upbeat evaluation of the 105th Congress, which met for
far fewer days and passed far fewer laws than the average Congress
before it, came from House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first Congress since the 1920s to deliver a projected
10 years of a balanced budget _ a $1.6 trillion surplus over the
next 10 years,'' Gingrich said, ``setting the stage for us to come
back next year in a bipartisan way and save Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   The most scorching assessment came from his Democratic
counterpart, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, who recalled that
his fellow Missourian, President Harry Truman, had excoriated the
80th Congress as the ``Do-Nothing Congress'' in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Congress would make the 80th Congress look energetic and
effective,'' Gephardt said. ``They did rename (Washington's)
National Airport for Ronald Reagan, if you think that's an
important thing to have accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said, ``''I think it is their desire to please special
interests that has kept them from bring up the patient's bill of
rights, kept them from bringing up tobacco legislation and
(Democratic) education legislation, and interested them in a tax
cut when they should have been saving the money for Social Security
first.''
</P>
<P>
   The actual record of the Republican-controlled Congress, as it
alternated between cooperation and confrontation with the
Democratic White House, supports both Gingrich's and Gephardt's
views.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, President Clinton and Congress did indeed put off
action on some complex legislative dilemmas, including badly needed
new regulatory methods of dealing with the dangerously
fast-changing world of banks, investments and electric utilities.
</P>
<P>
   But that year they also agreed on a bipartisan five-year plan
that slowed the pace of projected spending increases by enough to
balance the federal budget for the first time in three decades. If
the nation never has another recession, even Gingrich's highly
unlikely dream of pain-free cures for Social Security's problems
could come true.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, they also adopted $95 billion in net tax cuts _ the
first tax bill since 1981 to contain more cuts than increases. It
included credits of $500 a child for families and lower tax rates
on estates and capital gains, as well as enough narrowly targeted
tax breaks to add 285 sections and 824 amendments to the U.S. tax
code.
</P>
<P>
   This year, of course, Congress killed the national tobacco
settlement and campaign finance reforms favored by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But together they also agreed on a bipartisan plan to overhaul
the Internal Revenue Service. They hope it will keep the IRS from
irritating taxpayers or treading on their rights while enforcing
the more complex tax code.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and Clinton this year also agreed on less publicized,
but potentially significant laws: job-training revisions, an
overhaul of low-income housing programs, and a humongous injection
of funds into highways and mass transit.
</P>
<P>
   Though they couldn't compete for headlines with congressional
action on the ethics of Gingrich in 1997 and of Clinton in 1998,
those low-profile laws adopted by big, bipartisan votes could
change life for millions of American workers, poor families and
commuters in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   This year's major reforms included:
</P>
<P>
   _ Job-training revisions. Ending a six-year stalemate over how
to fix federal job-training programs so diverse that nobody even
checked to see which ones were effective, Congress and the
administration agreed on a law simplifying the programs, giving
state and local officials more autonomy, and building in some
monitoring programs designed to find out which methods work best.
</P>
<P>
   _ Low-income housing overhaul. Three years of agonizing
negotiations between the Senate, the House and the White House
resulted in a 400-page law that retiring Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy,
D-Mass., described as ``the first major overhaul of the public
housing of this country in 60 years.'' As an alternative to using
public housing to warehouse the poorest of the poor, the bill
phases in programs that reward work by subsidized tenants, and
gives local officials more flexibility in programs designed to
provide affordable apartments to poor people or help them pay their
rent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Highways and mass transit. The six-year surface transportation
bill, guaranteeing each state at least 90.5 cents for each dollar
raised by federal gasoline taxes within its boundaries, allocates
$216 billion. That included a record $12 billion for bus and rail
projects and $9 billion for ``pork barrel'' projects specified by
individual members of Congress.

BUYING THE STORY ABOUT THE NEW BILL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: How can I read the secret information that is
recorded on the new $20 bill? Do I need a special magnetic stripe
reader, or is there a way to download it?
</P>
<P>
   _ Double Sawbuck
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DOUBLE: Well, it didn't take long for that rumor to get
started, did it? And I can remember when all we had to worry about
were the United Nations shock troops massing on our borders and
patrolling the skies in their black helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   They're still there, of course, but there is no secret chip
embedded in the bill. There is, however, a micro-cam cleverly
concealed in each of Andrew Jackson's eyes. Haven't you noticed the
way the portrait's eyes follow you, no matter where you stand?
</P>
<P>
   The real changes in the 20 are primarily to make it tougher on
counterfeiters. There's no electronic wizardry involved, at least
none that I can talk about without violating the federal Big Scary
Secrets Act of 1968. The only thing vaguely suspicious about the
new bill is that it looks like it was designed by the lowest
bidder, whose last experience must have been at Parker Brothers
churning out Monopoly money. And if there's any nefarious plot
behind anything, it's one designed to keep U.S. dollars at home,
since the new bill is much too embarrassing to show to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Is there a way to deactivate the 3.5-inch
floppy via software to keep people from inserting virus-loaded
disks?
</P>
<P>
   _ Germ-Free
</P>
<P>
   DEAR FREE: You could try deactivating the floppy drive through
your setup program. (Oh, get the manual out. I can't be expected to
tell you how to do everything.) Just be forewarned that your
particular setup may automatically recognize the drive and
reactivate it. Either that, or it could refuse to let you reboot at
all.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose you might find some drive-locking software, or you
could pop the top on your PC and yank the power and data cables
out. There are even real locks you can stick in the drive, but
guess what? Even if you stuffed the floppy drive full of aged
Gouda, you'd still be susceptible to viruses in things you download
from the Internet. Go buy a good virus scanner that has free
monthly updates.
</P>
<P>
   STUPID SOFTWARE TRICK: Proving once again that Microsoft
engineers have way too much time on their hands, check out this
Windows 98 silliness:
</P>
<P>
   Use Windows Explorer to open up the Windows folder. Click into
Application Data, then Microsoft, then Welcome. Look for a file
called Weldata.exe and right-click on it. Select Create Shortcut
from the menu that pops up.
</P>
<P>
   Now right-click on the shortcut you just made and select
Properties from the menu. In the Target box, after the stuff that's
already there, add a space, then 
``You(underscore)are(underscore)a(underscore)real(underscore)rascal'
' minus the quotes, of course. In the Run box, select Minimized.
Now click on OK.
</P>
<P>
   When you double-click on the shortcut, you'll get the names of
the Win98 developers, so you finally know who to blame. And don't
let them distract you with that slide show of the Microsoft campus
and Seattle. I think that's how Janet Reno got sidetracked.

WHITE HOUSE WEIGHS RESUBMITTING HORMEL BID FOR AMBASSADOR POST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the wake of the apparent failure of the Senate
to approve the nomination of gay rights advocate James C. Hormel to
be ambassador to Luxembourg, the White House is considering whether
to resubmit his bid next year.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Socarides, special assistant to the president, said
Friday that if Congress adjourns in the next few days _ as expected
_ without acting on Hormel's nomination, ``the president will weigh
what options he has.''
</P>
<P>
   Socarides added that ``a recess appointment is an option, a post
that doesn't require Senate confirmation is an option, or the
president would resubmit his name next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The aide, who said the White House will consult with Hormel to
see what he wants, added: ``The president has used his recess
appointment power very sparingly. Resubmitting the nomination is
always a more likely scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Socarides stressed that the administration ``is deeply
disappointed that Mr. Hormel's nomination has not been acted on
simply because he is gay. We have a commitment to him that we are
going to do everything we can to see that someone who is as
qualified and distinguished as Mr. Hormel can make the contribution
he has so graciously offered to make to this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., a leading advocate for Hormel,
has urged President Clinton ``to use his constitutional authority
to make a recess appointment of Hormel,'' according to her press
secretary, Jim Hock.
</P>
<P>
   He said Feinstein believes that ``the failure to vote on his
nomination is really quite incomprehensible. She believes he's been
denied the constitutionally delineated due process of a Senate vote
and debate simply because he is gay.''
</P>
<P>
   Hock said Feinstein, who has known Hormel for more than two
decades, deems him ``a man of decency and honor and the type of
person who should be encouraged to be in public service.''
</P>
<P>
   Hormel's nomination has been blocked by Senate Republicans for
nearly a year. Conservatives, including Sens. James M. Inhofe,
R-Okla., Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., and Robert C. Smith, R-N.H., used
a parliamentary maneuver known as a ``hold'' to stymie a floor
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents said a gay activist would be an inappropriate
choice for the job because Luxembourg is a predominantly Catholic
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., likened
homosexuality to kleptomania, alcoholism and sex addiction. He has
refused to bring Hormel's nomination to the Senate floor for a vote
since it was approved 16 to 2 last November by the Foreign
Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel, a San Francisco philanthropist, is a Democratic Party
donor, former dean at the University of Chicago Law School and heir
to the Hormel meat packing fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Winnie Stachelberg, political director for the Human Rights
Campaign, the nation's largest gay and lesbian organization which
Hormel helped found, called the Republican stalling on Hormel's
nomination ``another example of anti-gay bias.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Hormel ``surely would have won'' if his nomination had
come up for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   She also said the nomination was failing because ``he is honest
and open about who he is. Unfortunately, there are people in the
U.S. Senate who think it's okay to discriminate against gay people
simply because of their sexual orientation. It sends a signal not
only to Jim Hormel but to an entire community of people that just
because of their sexual orientation they can't hold certain jobs. I
would have thought that our country was beyond that. It's clear to
me that we have a long way to go.''

   BKCHOI _ ATLANTA _ The curse and the blessing of the South is
that it functions as a sort of national theater, acting out the
subjects _ race, history, class _ that the rest of the country
assumes immunity from. While mainstream America cheerfully
dismisses the past as irrelevant, the South is still the designated
land of suffering, poverty, prejudice: America's ``old country.''
While these powerful images may be, by now, gross stereotyping,
their core truth feeds Southern writers on a rich diet of subtlety,
profundity and irony lacking in other American fiction, say, the
Updike school of high WASP suffering or the McInerneyesque
chronicles of People magazine partygoing. So it's good to report
that Susan Choi believes in the old-time religion of William
Faulkner, Ralph Ellison and Eudora Welty. Her first novel is a
strong, graceful piece of prose that stirs war, love, class and
culture together in a strange and beautiful alchemy. (Roberts,

fascination ``The Usual Suspects'' exerted on a generation of teen

the scene in the lobby of the Paramount last Thursday after the
screening of Bryan Singer's latest flick, ``Apt Pupil.'' This is
what happens when you're an impossibly young and hugely successful

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Following the brouhaha over the White House
sexcapades, I've spent some time deciding who has earned my
sympathy. It's not Monica; she brought this on herself. For the
same reason, it isn't President Clinton. Hillary Rodham Clinton
made a conscious decision to marry the man, and since I still sort
of believe in both freewill and karma, she's out.
</P>
<P>
   The two people I came up with were Chelsea Clinton and Monica's
father, Bernard.
</P>
<P>
   I'm afraid Chelsea may be out of the running, however. For one
thing, she has sympathy coming in from all sides. She's young,
attractive, and the pity is all too obvious. Furthermore, Chelsea
has many years ahead of her, affording her the opportunity to be
judged upon the actions of her own life. Failing that, if Chelsea
were to marry, she could choose to drift into the relative
anonymity of her husband's surname.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the case for Bernard Lewinsky. Not only is he older,
but he's also facing the likelihood that his name will become
synonymous with a couple of different sexual acts. I'm sure that at
some time this man is going to hear the expression ``pull a
Lewinsky'' or ``got a Lewinsky,'' and boy, is he going to blush.
And every time he writes a check or goes through U.S. Customs,
someone's going to raise an eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   The same for all the Lewinskys and Lewinskis in this country,
most of whom are not directly related to Monica. All I can think
is: Man, what a bummer.
</P>
<P>
   For so many people.
</P>
<P>
   My last name is Rail, ``liar'' spelled backwards, which is kind
of cute, I guess. It at least makes for an innocuous icebreaker. A
rail is a kind of bird found in marshes and wetlands. Compared to
having something like Ramsbottom or Assman for a name, it's not
bad. Aside from my father, a poet, the only notorious Rail I know
of is Jack Rail, a distant uncle, who was a cattle rustler and folk
hero back in Oklahoma. They wrote songs about him.
</P>
<P>
   By way of comparison, contrast the various connotations of your
own last name with those of the future dictionary entry of
``LEWINSKY (loo-in-skee) v. and n.''
</P>
<P>
   I decided to contact some of the objects of my sympathy, the
Lewinskys and Lewinskis of the world. I did a quick search and sent
e-mail messages explaining that I was a writer, and that I wanted
to know how the developments in Washington had affected their
lives, considering their last names. For what it was worth, I even
promised not to identify them.
</P>
<P>
   What I expected was that they had thought about changing their
name to Lewis or Levin, or to some appellation equally discreet. I
expected complaints. The weird thing was that none of the
recipients responded. I guess they're not dealing with the negative
connotations very well.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, ``rail'' is slang for a line of cocaine,
which isn't necessarily negative or positive, although it does have
a meaning other than the little marsh bird who gave his name to my
tribe. There is a slight chance that people have heard my name and
envisioned an Escobar-esque figure, with illegal narcotics and
firearms piled on my desk like Al Pacino in ``Scarface.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, my heart goes out to them, the Lewinskys and Lewinskis
of the world. Anyone who knows that one day he might hear his name
in the context of ``the boss (LAST NAME)ed another intern,'' gets
my sympathy. These are people who can't have something as common as
a cigar come up in conversation without an awkward silence _ simply
because of their name. Men and women, innocents all, whose surname
has come to mean something other than who they are, or what they
were, before this whole thing started.
</P>

GIRL POWER ON THE OPERA STAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Whatever you do for a living, imagine that your
job requires you to do it while wearing a hot, heavy, uncomfortable
uniform in front of, say, 3,500 people. Imagine that you have been
working for several weeks on a special project. You have eaten and
slept the thing, tended to every nuance and detail. More than
anything, you want the project to be perfect and pleasing.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you present it. Within 48 hours, because it is their
job, several people publicly assess your project. Almost all of
them say it stunk. They say that everything you are trained to do,
you did badly. They use terms like ``inadequate,'' ``regrettable,''
``desperate,'' ``acidic,'' ``ungovernable'' and ``squally.'' They
call the boss who gave you the project ``deluded.''
</P>
<P>
   The really bad news? Because it is your job, you get to go out a
few days later in your hot, heavy, uncomfortable uniform and
present the project again to another 3,500 people _ most of whom
have read the scathing public assessments.
</P>
<P>
   How would you feel? What would you do? Until I met a German
opera singer named Gabriele Schnaut, I figured I would call in
sick, grab my passport and Visa card and head for the Great Barrier
Reef. But Schnaut changed me.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, as a supernumerary (extra actor) for the San
Francisco Opera, I portrayed one of Schnaut's handmaidens in
Puccini's ``Turandot.'' We weren't even remotely buddies but, from
a close perspective, I watched her work hard through weeks of
rehearsals, a nerve-wracking opening night of the autumn opera
season and six more performances. During that time, she was
meticulous and careful about her interpretation of the icy,
rage-filled Chinese princess who finally learns that love is all
that really matters.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some opera divas I have worked with, Schnaut was kind to
us lowly extras; she treated us as if we were intelligent human
beings instead of flesh-upholstered furniture. Sometimes onstage,
when she sang the killer, second-act aria, ``In questa reggia,'' it
was hard not to shout; I was that moved by her performance. One
night, she was so great, she made me cry, and I had to have my
garish red and white makeup redone between acts.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the local critics blasted her. And when I say ``blasted
her,'' I mean her. (Critics never just say they didn't like
somebody or that a production failed. They write personally,
pointedly and meanly, as if a phalanx of idiots and no-goods had
betrayed all of humanity.)
</P>
<P>
   In the five days between the reviews and the second performance
of ``Turandot,'' I could not imagine how bad it felt to be Gabriele
Schnaut. Every time I thought about being her and going back
onstage to sing some of the toughest music ever written for the
female voice, I found myself curling up in the fetal position.
</P>
<P>
   When the second performance came, however, Schnaut did something
that pro basketball people call ``putting on a clinic.'' In Act II,
she mounted a center stage stairway in her hot, heavy and
uncomfortable princess garb, opened her mouth and sang ``In questa
reggia'' with a beauty and fury that I have rarely seen. In 25
years in the newspaper business, I have encountered and written
about some mighty powerful women, but nobody was as possessed of
personal power as Schnaut was that night.
</P>
<P>
   When the act was over and the singer had disappeared into her
dressing room, I asked her wardrobe people to please tell her that
one of the handmaidens said she had kicked ass. It was the best
term I could think of.
</P>
<P>
   At the next performance, before we went onstage, I asked her if
the message had been conveyed. ``Yah,'' she said in a delightful
German accent. ``They say that I kicked the ass.'' But she looked
at me quizzically so I corrected the phrase and explained what it
meant.
</P>
<P>
   She nodded, revisiting that night. ``I was furious,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Gabriele Schnaut joined my Girl Power hall of fame.
Lie down and die because a handful of folks eviscerated you in
print? Feign illness and slink off to the Great Barrier Reef in
defeat? Not this dame. She fought back with everything she had, and
she not only survived, she prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   What a role model. From now on, as far as I'm concerned, the
translation of ``In questa reggia'' is: ``'Cause I'm woman _
W-O-M-A-N.''

NOT ALL GOP RACES IN NEW YORK WILL BE AS EASY AS PATAKI'S 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ New York Gov. George Pataki seems to be in the
same enviable position in which Edwin Edwards found himself when he
ran for re-election as governor of Louisiana a few years back.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards bragged that the only way he could lose would be if he
were caught in bed with a dead girl or a live boy. And, in Pataki's
case, the live boy could give him a big boost in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   That's not true, however, for any other New York Republican
running this year. Polling numbers show New Yorkers, unlike voters
in the Heartland, increasingly hostile to Republicans over this
Zippergate scandal in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   That explains why both Pataki and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, whose
re-election bid is hardly a sure thing, have maintained stony
silences on the issue. Neither has uttered a word on Zippergate,
and each quite clearly would bite his tongue in half before doing
so.
</P>
<P>
   It also indicates that races further down the ticket may not be
the smooth cruises that Republicans had envisioned _ not the 10 or
so seats that they'd hoped to pick up in the State Assembly and not
the race in New York's 22nd Congressional District.
</P>
<P>
   The 22nd stretches from up near the Canadian border down to New
York City's northern suburbs. For two decades, it has been
represented by Gerald B.H. Solomon. He's one of the most
conservative members of the House of Representatives. As chairman
of the House Rules Committee, Solomon has been one of the House's
most powerful members for the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   But the district has changed since Solomon took office in the
1970s. What was once a conservative rural district is now,
overwhelmingly, a collection of suburban communities where voting
patterns have moderated.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP maintains a 2-1 enrollment edge in the district, but a
large percentage of the voters are affiliated with neither major
party, and Bill Clinton won this congressional district in 1996.
That same year, a personable actor/farmer named Steve James spent a
little money on some clever television ads. Against Solomon, a
nine-term incumbent, James polled two in five votes cast.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, when Solomon unexpectedly announced his retirement
this year, the state's Republican leadership stepped in to ensure
that the local Republican organization did not select a
right-winger to succeed him. Instead, state Republican chief Bill
Powers anointed John Sweeney, a high-ranking Pataki aide. Sweeney
is a gregarious, middle-of-the-road sort and a longtime political
operative who's never held elected office. Meanwhile, the Democrats
were unable to persuade James to run again. And, on such short
notice, they were unable to find another candidate with big name
recognition in the district. They settled instead on Jean
Bordewich, a Red Hook council member. She's also a moderate and
perfectly plausible in the 22nd. But she's from the district's
southern tip and lacks the cash to build celebrity in the Albany
metro area, where most of votes are.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney's strategy in this race has been to lie low _ to do his
utmost to deny Bordewich visibility in metro Albany and to trumpet
his role in the Pataki administration through a ceaseless barrage
of broadcast ads. Chances are this strategy will work. Powers is a
brilliant tactician and he has taken a personal interest in this
race.
</P>
<P>
   But conservatives in the district waged a bitter primary fight
against Sweeney. They could sit home in November, or even vote for
Bordewich, just to punish the state GOP organization. So if
Bordewich can build visibility during the campaign's last few
weeks, voters in the 22nd could end up with a genuine horse race.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Sweeney should win this and probably will.
</P>
<P>
   But his road is rockier than Pataki's.

HOW LAWYERS JUDGE TV LEGAL DRAMAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Lawyers often warn juries that the justice system
doesn't play out in real life the way it does on television. No,
there aren't any quirky bird whistles (a la ``Ally McBeal's''' John
``The Biscuit'' Cage) or daily dramatics as in ``Law and Order.''
</P>
<P>
   The law, a tangled mass of tedium, arcane and dramatic, has a
history as a literary vehicle dating back to the Greeks. The Bible
also had some serious courtroom drama (the Garden of Eden ruling,
Solomon vowing to split a kid, Pontius Pilate washing his hands),
and, of course, Shakespeare was a big fan of attorneys (``King
Henry'' 'nuf said).
</P>
<P>
   The only thing hotter than writer/producer David E. Kelley right
now is his dueling hit shows, ``The Practice'' on ABC and ``Ally
McBeal'' on Fox. Outside of both qualifying as Emmy-nominated
programs, the disparate shows really share only one other quality:
They revolve around law firms.
</P>
<P>
   Cop shows. Doctor shows. The wheel spins constantly in the
television cycle. And while ``ER'' remains at the top of the
ratings, legal shows have become dominant again on television.
</P>
<P>
   But what do lawyers think of the modern-day legal dramas? Well,
they believe some are entertaining _ even beneficial _ as long as
you don't mind the fine points getting screwed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any show gets it exactly right,'' said Judith
Kaye, chief judge of the New York Court of Appeals. ``It is
entertainment and what goes on in the courts is real.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that she is complaining. ``The public appetite for these
shows is insatiable,'' Kaye said. ``I think it is positive in the
sense it encourages interest in the justice system. I (also) think
it is negative because it is not realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad medicine ruins doctor shows for doctors. Screw up the sports
and jock types get irked. By nature, the law is a contemplative
process, one which must be accelerated to make gripping television.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing about legal shows on TV is if you practice
law they are never really realistic, because frankly things are too
exciting,'' said Patrick Borchers, associate dean at the Albany Law
School. ``Every case goes to trial. Every lawyer is always doing
one closing argument an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a consensus for the most accurate legal show on
television, it's ``Law &AMP; Order,'' the NBC drama which follows one
case a week through the investigative and legal stages (the 1980s
``L.A. Law'' was effective in illustrating how much of law is
practiced in a conference room rather than a courtroom).
</P>
<P>
   That said, maybe the most unrealistic legal show is the most
famous.
</P>
<P>
   While not the first on television, the granddaddy of legal shows
is, of course, ``Perry Mason,'' which debuted on radio in 1943 and
on television 14 years later (the first courtroom television show
may have been ``Famous Jury Trials,'' which debuted in 1949).
Defense attorney Mason never lost a case to District Attorney
Hamilton Burger (Remember? Ham Burger.), and the real guilty
parties often revealed themselves under withering
cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   Today, lawyers routinely warn jurors that real trials are not
like ``Perry Mason.'' Not Stephen Coffey: The Albany defense
attorney wants jurors to look for the dramatic. And Coffey adds
there is even something lawyers can take away from the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best courtroom manner I've seen was `Perry Mason,''' he
said. ``The manner and the way he handled himself and the degree of
calm was tremendous. If you want to see how to have a real nice
manner _ Raymond Burr. The medium is the message.''

`BELOVED' A POWERFUL LOOK AT LOVE, VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Beloved'' is a deep, deep well of a movie, a film that ripples
with meaning and metaphor and unnerving supernatural questions.
Absorbing, confusing and uncompromisingly dark, director Jonathan
Demme's much-awaited interpretation of Toni Morrison's novel
challenges the very notion of what a movie can and should demand of
its viewers.
</P>
<P>
   It demands, first of all, attention. It demands an understanding
of and appreciation for literary devices. It demands a patient,
almost Buddha-like acceptance of sudden leaps in time or logic. It
demands a bluntness of view and a willingness to watch scenes of
unbearable brutality. Finally, it demands time 171 minutes of it,
all of them jammed with subtlety.
</P>
<P>
   The result almost defies description. It should: A powerful work
of art ought to throw a hard visceral punch, it ought to provoke
the audience on a purely wordless level. And this one does. Even
when ``Beloved'' seems to falter even when its plot skips over
yawning gaps or its characters change abruptly, it still hits the
gut with almost sickening might. Despite its huge rush of advance
publicity and the reassuring omnipresence of its star, Oprah
Winfrey, ``Beloved'' is not tailored for mainstream consumption.
It's simply too difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for starters, the subject matter. Set during the
Reconstruction, the story concerns Sethe (Winfrey), an ex-slave
haunted by the ghost of her dead baby girl; how the baby died is a
hazy matter through most of the film, but this isn't some cute
little poltergeist. It shatters mirrors, flings a rabid dog across
a room, throws kitchen appliances and more or less terrorizes the
household. ``Now, what you go'n do that for?'' says Sethe's
surviving daughter, Denver (Kimberly Elise), after a spectral
tantrum inspires the family's two boys to run away for good.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Sethe regards her ghostly child with resignation, even love.
``My God, girl, what kinda evil you got in here?'' asks Paul D
(Danny Glover), an old friend and former slave who stands,
transfixed and haunted, at the threshold to Sethe's home. ``It
ain't evil,'' she says, beckoning him to enter. ``Just sad.''
</P>
<P>
   And jealous. The lost infant rages against Paul D, who earns
Sethe's affections and barely escapes death by flying furniture.
After a while, the haunting ends. But no sooner does the house
settle into a cozy new family life than an enigmatic young woman
(Thandie Newton) materializes on a tree stump in Sethe's front
yard, fast asleep and swarming with ladybugs. Innocent and eerily
unmarked, she barely speaks (although she gives her name as
``Beloved''), toddles like a 2-year-old, bears no callouses on her
feet and, after Sethe takes her in, soils her bed at night.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Denver recognizes Beloved as an adult incarnation of
the infant ghost. But Demme's film (his first since
``Philadelphia''), so madly and beautifully literary, suggests that
the woman might be something else entirely: She might be a metaphor
for Sethe's past in slavery (shown in excruciatingly intense
flashbacks), or she might come from the farthest reaches of the
character's tortured psyche. She might, in other words, be Sethe
herself.
</P>
<P>
   This is hefty material for a big-studio movie, and it doesn't
always work. As the ambiguities pile up, stacking layer after layer
of allegorical subtlety, they threaten to snuff out the film for
lack of oxygen there's no breathing room. Much hay has been made
over the film's recent screenplay disputes (three screenwriters are
credited: Akosua Busia, Adam Brooks and Richard LaGravenese), but
its claustrophobia has less to do with the script than Demme's
daredevil attempt to make a film as thick with ideas as Morrison's
brimming prose.
</P>
<P>
   Taken on its own terms, the movie succeeds profoundly. Winfrey
makes an impressively natural return to film following her
Oscar-nominated debut in ``The Color Purple,'' wearing Sethe's
tragic past like a plain and tattered cloak. Her matter-of-fact
acceptance of a sad, mean world picks up a soft glow from Glover's
performance, which is an absolute feat of understatement and
simplicity. He's a gentle man, shaped by gentle nuances. And
Thandie Newton (``Jefferson in Paris'') startles as the cryptic
Beloved, filling a blank-slate character with childlike
manipulativeness and monstrous strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beloved'' is not a simple film. It's not a flawless film. But
it is an extraordinary glimpse into the heart of slavery, a
heroically ambitious study of loss and love and violence that
speaks literally and figuratively with eloquent force.

MOVING TO A NEW LAPTOP: PART II 
</HEADLINE>
  By STEPHEN C. MILLER 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week I explained some of the reasons why moving your
programs and data to a new Windows-based laptop is no piece of
cake. In short, you need to reinstall all of your programs from the
original disks and update them with new patches and bug fixes. But
that's only half the job. You still need to move your critical data
and settings from the old computer to the new one.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've got your programs installed, you need to transfer
all your custom settings. If you really use your programs, you've
probably customized them to your individual needs and quirky work
habits. And transferring the settings is not as simple as resetting
your options on the new systems.
</P>
<P>
   For example, I get between 200 and 250 piece of e-mail a day. If
all of that mail got dumped into my in-box, I would never get any
work done because I'd be too busy reading mail. I'd also not be
able to easily separate the mail that needs to be answered right
away from that which can be deleted unread.
</P>
<P>
   My e-mail life is made manageable because I have filters to
automatically sort my mail. The mail from my boss is put in one
folder and the mail from the guy who thinks that the Pope is Satan
can go directly to trash. I have 57 filters that sort my e-mail
into 65 mailboxes. It took a long time to setup those filters and I
don't want to have to recreate them from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   In this example, it's not too difficult because my e-mail
program puts all the filters and mailbox information in one place.
The files are small and I can simply copy them to a floppy disk and
then copy them into the matching folder in the new computer.
</P>
<P>
   But with some programs, it is not easy to locate the files
control how you've customized a program. I know that many of you
don't like to read documentation _ in too many cases, with good
reason _ but the chances are good that there is a section in the
manual telling you where and how customization is handled.
</P>
<P>
   If no such section exists, you might need to contact the company
that developed the program. While waiting on hold is a hassle, most
vendors now have Web sites where you can e-mail your request and
quickly get an answer.
</P>
<P>
   Moving your data can be complicated by your own organizational
angst and the nature and size of the files. I have created
sub-folders on my hard drive to keep certain files in convenient
locations.
</P>
<P>
   All of my columns go in one folder, my book is in another
folder, training documentation is in yet another folder. I've got a
dozen or so multimedia presentations that are large and won't fit
on a single or even a half dozen floppy disks.
</P>
<P>
   If you're lucky enough to be on a LAN and have a PC card network
adapter in each laptop, you can create a transfer folder on the
network server and copy your folder structure from the old laptop
to the new one.
</P>
<P>
   For another real-life example, I have all my musings in a folder
called ``stories.'' I have several sub-folders under it. I simple
copy the ``stories'' folder to the network folder. Everything
within it gets copied as well.
</P>
<P>
   Once the copy is complete, I go to the same folder from the new
laptop and copy the ``stories'' folder intact quickly and easily.
</P>
<P>
   Another option for transferring files is a program like
Traveling Software's Laplink. Laplink connects the two computers
together via a cable and you can ``clone'' your folders to the new
system. Laplink, and other programs like it, is for moving data,
not applications.

   It can certainly copy over all the files in an application
folder but it can't know about the INI files, the DLL's or Registry
entries that are needed to make the program run properly. It could
lock up your system as the program searches in vain for the missing
piece of its code.
</P>
<P>
   One option I considered was using the backup from a mass storage
device like a SyQuest or Jaz drive. If you were just restoring to
your current system or even a system that was the same make and
model, it would work, but new systems have been tweaked and certain
system files have been changed.
</P>
<P>
   There are new audio and video drives optimized for your new
system. If you just restore from another machines, you could
overwrite those files and crash the system.
</P>
<P>
   I, like many other Windows users, wish that the process were
simpler. Maybe it will be in Windows NT 3000.
</P>
<P>
   As my many Mac readers keep pointing out, it is easier with a
Macintosh, but I and my company have invested a lot of money in
acquiring Windows applications. It is just not economically
feasible to switch to a Mac and buy all new programs just to avoid
the, albeit tedious, process of switching to a new computer every
year or so.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the chores, like spring-cleaning that has to be
done but nothing makes it pleasant. But at least when it's over,
the house is clean.

EDUCATORS EMPHASIZE TEACHER TRAINING IN TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
  By PAMELA MENDELS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twice in as many weeks, education experts have trained their
spotlights on a seemingly simple concept: If the billions of
dollars being spent on technology in schools are to reap any
educational benefit, teachers need to know how to use the computers
that are purchased for their classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, officials at United States Department of
Education announced the winners of its annual Technology Innovation
Challenge Grant program, but stressed that this year there was
twist. For the first time since the award program was established
four years ago, grant money was only being given to teacher
training projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is imperative to have well-trained teachers. Otherwise, you
can't realize the benefit of your investment,'' explained Jenelle
V. Leonard, who is in charge of the challenge grant program for the
Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Then last week, the results of a new study of classroom computer
use appeared to support the new emphasis of the challenge grants.
The report found that computer-equipped students taught by
educators who had received technology training scored better on
achievement tests than other students.
</P>
<P>
   The message of these two developments was clear: The machine is
only as effective as the teacher using it.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem an obvious point, but it still has not been embraced
by the vast majority of American school districts. Technology
experts say a rule-of-thumb is that about 30 percent of a school or
district's technology budget should be devoted to what educators
call ``professional development.'' In fact, said Leonard, the
average amount spent ``is hovering around three to five percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Debate still rages about whether the $5 billion or so spent
annually on school technology as a whole is a wise investment, and
neither the grant program announcement nor the new report, titled
``Does it Compute?,'' is likely to settle the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The study, carried out by a researcher from the Educational
Testing Service in Princeton, N.J., found mixed results in its
examination of fourth graders and eighth graders who used computers
in their math lessons. The younger students using computers showed
only slight gains over others.
</P>
<P>
   Eighth graders who used computers for more sophisticated
purposes, such as simulations, made significant leaps, but lost
ground if they used computers primarily for drills.
</P>
<P>
   One finding, however, was beyond dispute: the central role of
the computer-savvy teacher. The researcher, Harold H. Wenglinsky,
found that eighth grade mathematics students in classes with
teachers who had received technology training were about 13 weeks
ahead of others in their mathematics skills. Wenglinsky described
this gain as ``tremendously significant,'' and asserted, ``Teacher
training played an absolutely critical role.''
</P>
<P>
   Because professional development was loosely defined, the study
_ paid for by the Educational Testing Service and commissioned by
Education Week's annual Technology Counts special report _ left
unanswered how much and what kind of training would do the most
good.
</P>
<P>
   But the innovation challenge grants, awarded to 20 projects at a
cost of about $30 million for this fiscal year, were awarded to a
wide variety of training programs.
</P>
<P>
   A project in West Virginia, for example, will train 1,680
teachers how to integrate technology into curriculum planning, and
culminate with the requirement that participating teachers post a
lesson they have crafted on a Web site available to other teachers.
</P>
<P>
   In El Paso, Texas, meanwhile, grant money will go to support,
among other things, getting 160 teachers through a masters degree
program in integrating technology into the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   A three-state project led by the Stevens Institute of Technology
in Hoboken, N.J., seeks to enlist community colleges to train
teachers in how to use the Internet in innovative ways to teach
science.
</P>
<P>
   In a 30-hour course, teachers will be introduced to activities
such as a collaborative project in which students measure the
boiling point of water where they live and compare their findings
to those of peers from a variety of other locations. The lesson
learned: boiling point varies with altitude.
</P>
<P>
   Edward A. Friedman, director of Stevens's Center for Improved
Engineering and Science Education, said such training projects are
necessary because too few teachers know how to use the expensive
hardware that is suddenly appearing in their classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mindless use of technology is to be deplored and there is
too much of that going on,'' he said. ``The acquisition of
technology by the schools has gone ahead of the knowledgeable use
by teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   But some observers remain skeptical that technology in schools
is worth the cost _ even with well-trained teachers.
</P>
<P>
   William L. Rukeyser, coordinator of Learning in the Real World,
a group that has urged greater caution about school wiring and
other technology projects, conceded this week ``training is better
than no training; that was underlined by the Educational Testing
Service study.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added: ``What are the indications that educational
technology, even when combined with training, is going to be cost
effective when measured against the alternative? That seems to be
one of the most basic questions, but one of the ones most rarely
asked.''

ARTS(AT)LARGE 
 ARTIST DROPS OILS FOR FLASH 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Jef is cq.) 
 By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jef Morlan has given his brushes the brushoff. After 23 years of
painting, the artist has made the computer screen his canvas.
</P>
<P>
   The vibrant results can be viewed in Snarg, Morlan's ongoing
exhibition on the World Wide Web, a medium he now finds more
compelling than the oil-based pigments he spread for so long.
</P>
<P>
   Although young artists are increasingly accustomed to the idea
of cyberspace as a creative outlet, few professional artists are
willing to turn so completely toward new technology as the
43-year-old Morlan has by abandoning his easel and picking up a
keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't paint anymore,'' Morlan acknowledged recently during a
telephone interview from his home in Anacortes, Wash., near
Seattle. ``That's because of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't buy any supplies anymore _ no canvas, no paint,'' he
said. ``Distribution is instantaneous. When I was in a gallery, I'd
be lucky to get three, four hundred people a month at a show, and
on the Internet I'm getting at times over a thousand a day.''
</P>
<P>
   But the reasons for Morlan's commitment to the year-old Snarg
site extend beyond the way it lets him reach a wider audience. As a
musician, he relishes incorporating sound into his work. More
important, he values the Web's interactive elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing about this medium that has changed me forever is
giving up control and allowing a piece to have a life of its own,''
he said. ``If I was ever to go back to painting, I would be a
graffiti artist, just to watch how people respond to and interact
with what I put on the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Navigating through the diverse areas of the Snarg site does
necessitate a fair amount of user interaction, although Morlan
always seems in command of the highly painterly visual output. The
site requires the Flash browser plug-in and, on occasion, some
patience while its contents download.
</P>
<P>
   An animated introduction greets visitors to the site, featuring
a new-age take on Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man, with a
portentous soundtrack accompanying Morlan's stylized graphics and
androgynous figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes your psyche and pulls you right in,'' Morlan said.
The introduction is intended to act as a transition from the
everyday Web to Snarg's utterly distinctive environment. ``I want
you to get the feeling you're immersed in it, that you've gone
somewhere else,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction leads to one of the most remarkable aesthetic
spaces in cyberspace, a series of chartreuse- and fuschia-hued
screens filled with rounded, abstract shapes and glistening orbs
that throb, bounce and collide. It is as if Miro had created a
pinball game after a trip to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   It seems as if a certain '60s, almost psychedelic sensibility is
at play here, a welcome change from the retro look of the 50's that
continues to be so prevalent in online graphic design, but
allusions to Matisse and Picasso also can be discerned.
</P>
<P>
   Morlan, however, cites different inspirations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to most modern artists, I was very, very much into
the Baroque _ and Rubens in particular,'' he explained, an
influence seen in his use of sensuous shapes and juicy surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Morlan and his wife, Gael, actually spent most of 1997 working
in Antwerp, Belgium, the birthplace of Rubens. ``One of the great
things about living in Antwerp was that's where he was from and a
lot of the churches had his paintings,'' Morlan recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But after a year there, Morlan said, he finally burned out on
the work of a master he had long admired.
</P>
<P>
   New inspiration came quickly, though. During a visit to Spain,
he was exposed to the non-representational design work of the
Moorish artists who once practiced there. ``It was so open and such
a relief,'' he said. ``There's a freshness and airiness to it that
I just totally fell in love with.''
</P>
<P>
   Morlan said the discovery moved him further away from the oil
paintings of his past, although he continues to favor highly
saturated colors and to shun pure abstraction, which he considers
too sterile.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Snarg will ultimately land in a gallery space
divided into five sections. As hypnotic music composed by both
Morlans burbles in the background, they can explore the interactive
art in the ``Flashers'' and ``Just Because'' sections, or read
Gael's prose. Jef's earlier computer-generated work is showcased in
the ``Technobaroque'' area.
</P>
<P>
   But nowhere on the site will you learn that Snarg is, according
to Morlan, an acronym for the Sustainable New Arts Research Group,
an international consortium of Web-savvy creative types.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not really. ``It's a family nonsense word,'' he confessed.
``When something would come up, we'd just go, 'Well, snarg!' We're
kind of a goofy family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like giving a whole lot of information in Snarg,'' he
continued. ``I like it existing as an entity unto itself. You go
there, you have fun, you learn something _ you jump in Gael's and
my brain and leave.''

STRICT EUROPEAN PRIVACY LAW PUTS PRESSURE ON U.S.
</HEADLINE>
  By CARL S. KAPLAN 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, Europeans have benefitted from strict and broad data
privacy laws that protect personal information, like where a
citizen lives, what he buys and how much money he makes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as European nations stand ready to put into effect a
continent-wide standard for data-privacy protection, some legal
experts say the tough privacy rules of the Old World are putting
pressure on American lawmakers and business leaders to enhance
lagging New World privacy laws and practices.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst is the European Union's Data Protection Directive,
a sweeping law passed three years ago that becomes effective Oct.
25.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the notion that privacy is a fundamental human right,
it establishes a common minimum standard of data privacy protection
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The directive has raised the visibility of privacy law in the
U.S.,'' said Peter Swire, a law professor at Ohio State University
and co-author, with Robert Litan, of a new book on the European
law, due to be published by the Brookings Institution this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the least defensible corporate practices in the U.S.
are coming under pressure,'' Swire said, noting that in recent
months the Federal Trade Commission has worked hard to protect
children's privacy on the Internet and an increasing number of Web
sites in the United States have posted privacy policies. ``I don't
think the timing is a coincidence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's data law sets a ``standard of legal rights for
individuals in Europe that go far beyond the legal rights of
Americans,'' Swire said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the law requires that European citizens be told
what their personal data will be used for, Swire said. In addition,
citizens must have access to data about themselves in companies'
files, must have the ability to correct false information and must
be given notice and the opportunity to opt out before personal data
is transferred to a third party. There are additional, tighter
rules governing the use of ``sensitive'' personal data, like
information about health and religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of the European data law has pleased some American
privacy experts. It's Article 25 _ a rule with a ripple effect.
</P>
<P>
   According to the law, electronically stored personal information
about European citizens may flow freely across the borders of all
15 nations of the European Union after Oct. 25. But it can only
flow to a country outside the union if the receiving nation has
``adequate'' data protection. If it does not, privacy officials in
the individual European countries can impose embargoes on the
dissemination of the data.
</P>
<P>
   Few observers think that the United States, in general, has
``adequate'' privacy protection by European standards, Swire said.
After all, he said, unlike the European Union nations, the United
States does not have a single, comprehensive privacy law or an
agency charged with administering such laws.
</P>
<P>
   This means that the European law could conceivably affect a wide
range of American businesses and workers _ from journalists based
in Europe who e-mail notes back to New York containing names and
address of European contacts, to transnational companies based in
the United States that maintain computerized records on their
European workers.
</P>
<P>
   In one legal case, Swire said, a Swedish court has already ruled
that sensitive health data about airline passengers may not be
transferred from Sweden to an airline's reservation computers in
the United States without the passengers' consent. That case may be
appealed to privacy authorities at the European Union headquarters
in Brussels, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is, as it's written, the law has broad impact,''
said Swire, whose book, ``None of Your Business: World Data Flows,
Electronic Commerce, and the European Privacy Directive,'' examines
the law's possible impact. ``The unknown is how strictly it will be
enforced. I think there are certain categories of data that
Europeans care most about: health data, employee records, direct
marketing, personal financial data. And it's most likely that we'll
see enforcement in areas such as those.''
</P>
<P>
   Swire said United States and European officials are continuing
to discuss the new law. U.S. officials, trumpeting American-style
self-regulation, want recognition of ``safe harbors'' for certain
business practices, while Europeans want to see some progress on
U.S. privacy laws and enforcement. The clash between cultural views
of privacy protection _ market forces versus comprehensive laws _
is now a subject of international debate.
</P>
<P>
   Why do Europeans value privacy so highly? Swire points out that
after the experiences of World War II, many Europeans were fearful
of government surveillance and Nazi-style snooping. The first
European data protection law was passed in a state of what was then
West Germany in the early 1970s. There is also more suspicion of
the private sector in Europe than in the United States, and less
support for a laissez-faire approach to the handling of personal
information, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, a privacy rights group, said that Americans
value privacy just as highly as Europeans, if not more so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, we have a very strong tradition of privacy
protection,'' he said. ``What we don't have are adequate techniques
for enforcement, and we don't have a coherent approach to private
sector protection _ we have a patchwork quilt of laws. I think the
E.U. directive is a reminder that we have more work to do in the
U.S. to protect privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Reidenberg, a professor at Fordham Law School in New York
and an expert in international privacy law, said he also believes
that Americans value privacy as much as Europeans, though he
conceded that European laws offered a high level of protection to
citizens with respect to private-sector abuses of personal
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Europe became focused on privacy as a result of
American initiatives in the early 1970s, such as the Fair Credit
Reporting Act,'' he said, referring to a landmark American privacy
law governing consumer credit information.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-PRIVACY-CYBERTIMES-LAW-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; (UNDATED: credit information.) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reidenberg also predicted that over the next 5 to 10 years,
Congress will pass a comprehensive privacy law so as to meet the
European standard of ``adequate'' privacy protection. Otherwise, he
added, individual American companies and business sectors would
have to negotiate a series of private contracts and rulings with
European data privacy commissions. ``That's a lot harder than
saying there's a comprehensive law in the U.S. and everything is
fine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone agrees that the European law will lead to
similar legislation here. Charles Prescott, vice president of
international business development and government affairs for the
Direct Marketing Association, a trade group, said he believes there
is insufficient political will to pass a major privacy law in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't see that,'' he said. ``Also, we would have to set
up something with prosecutorial authority to enforce it. I don't
think the American people are ready for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Prescott predicted that industries and businesses in the United
States will become increasingly sensitized to privacy concerns and
enact stricter self-regulating codes that will be recognized by
European officials.
</P>
<P>
   The inevitable movement toward rough harmonization of American
and European notions of data privacy is a result of a linked world
where strongly held legal values are easily exported, said David
Post, a law professor at Temple University who has written
extensively about the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is going to be a back and forth on this, finding
something Americans and Europeans can live with,'' he said. ``It's
a way to have a cross-border dialogue that's appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The network (of data flows) does connect us,'' Post said.
``The E.U. directive was a kick in the pants.''

<P>
   Like a typical 3-year-old, my daughter Amy planned for Halloween
with gusto. She chose her own costume _ a purple leotard and a tutu
_ and wore it every day for weeks before the big event. She could
hardly wait to fill an entire bag with candy!
</P>
<P>
   Little did I know that Amy's Halloween would not be all smiles.
One minute she was shouting, ``Trick or treat!'' and the next she
was petrified of a teen-age witch we saw on our block.
</P>
<P>
   She flew into my arms, sobbing, ``I'm so scared!'' and demanding
to go home to Daddy.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed that our fun was ending so abruptly, I took Amy
home. As it turned out, she had a much better time greeting
trick-or-treaters at our door than she had venturing out into
unfamiliar Halloween country.
</P>
<P>
   I shouldn't have been so surprised by my daughter's reaction.
``It's not unusual for a 3-year-old to be overwhelmed on
Halloween,'' notes Ava Siegler, a child psychologist in New York
City and a contributing editor to Child magazine. ``Toddlers and
many preschoolers don't yet have the firm boundaries that help them
differentiate between what's real and what's pretend, making it
difficult for them to see scary things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Young children often don't like to be surprised,'' adds Karen
Marschke, a developmental specialist at the Corlears School in New
York City. ``They can't easily place new experiences into a context
that they understand, and this can leave them feeling confused and
upset.''
</P>
<P>
   How much Halloween excitement is appropriate for young kids? It
depends on your child's age and developmental stage.
</P>
<P>
   Babies are oblivious to what's going on; it's kids between 1 and
5 who are at risk of becoming frightened by what they're exposed to
on Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   But even more essential than following age guidelines is
``taking into account your child's temperament and personality,''
notes Marschke. While an outgoing toddler may thrive on the
excitement, one who's slow to warm up or easily upset would benefit
from a more cautious approach.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Toddlers &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   Keep it low key. Kids under age 3 are really not ready to go
trick-or-treating yet; they will feel much safer at home with you.
Many don't even enjoy the dressing-up part, since they often find
costumes constricting. It's important for you to keep expectations
reasonable and to plan activities that are short and predictable,
like a Halloween puppet show.
</P>
<P>
   If your child wants to dress up, a quick trip to a relative's
house to show off her costume is enough.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Preschoolers &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   Stay flexible. Children age 3 and older can better understand
the concept of pretend versus real, and are therefore ready to get
more involved in Halloween activities, including trick-or-treating.
But remember that even preschoolers can have a wide range of
reactions to Halloween _ from delight to terror.
</P>
<P>
   Before the big day, prepare your child for what's to come. Look
at costumes in a store, pointing out that people will be wearing
them. Say, ``This is a day when kids put on funny or scary outfits.
You'll see some ghosts and witches, but remember that underneath
each costume is a little boy like you,'' says Siegler.
</P>
<P>
   When planning activities, remember shorter is better. Limit
trick-or-treating to a few close friends or neighbors, so your
child doesn't get overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how much you prepare, if on the big day your child
still seems frightened, then you need to accept that he's not ready
yet. ``Parents have to determine how much of this holiday is for
them _ because they want to see their child dressed as a pumpkin _
and how much of it kids really enjoy,'' adds Siegler. ``Halloween
is not just about a photo-op. It's a children's holiday, so if they
are not having fun, don't celebrate it.''
</P>
<P>
   If you follow your child's cues and stay flexible, Halloween
will be an adventure to remember. And when he's ready, you'll snap
photos galore.

<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no doubt about it: For kids, Halloween is incredibly
exciting. But it's also potentially dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Safe Kids Campaign (NSKC) in
Washington, D.C., children under age 15 are four times more likely
to be hurt in a pedestrian accident on Halloween than on any other
night of the year. Injuries from falls and burns are common, too.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that there are some simple ways to keep your
kids safe without taking any of the fun out of the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what you need to know:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Think ahead &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A week or so before the big event, start talking about Halloween
safety, and be sure to communicate your rules clearly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are most likely to act impulsively when they're highly
stimulated,'' says Janette Benson, associate professor of
psychology at the University of Denver. ``Because they are so
focused on their goal _ in this case, the candy-they don't stop to
think before they act.''
</P>
<P>
   Take time to go over the rules when your children can focus on
what you're saying, then give a reminder on Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Shop wisely &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   Fires are the third-leading cause of accidental deaths among
children. So when you're assembling a costume:
</P>
<P>
   Look for masks, hats, wigs and clothing labeled ``flame
resistant.''
</P>
<P>
   Avoid outfits that have billowing material, long capes, or baggy
sleeves that could catch fire if brushed against candles or fit
jack-o'-lanterns.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dress for safety &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   Nothing takes the fun out of trick-or-treat time faster than a
Halloween ``boo''-boo caused by a slip or a fall. Be sure to:
</P>
<P>
   Hem your kids' costumes to mid-calf length or shorter to prevent
stumbles.
</P>
<P>
   Secure hats and wigs so they don't slip child down and block
your child's vision.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Mom's heels or Dad's boots, no matter how cute they look.
Choose comfy shoes with nonskid soles instead.
</P>
<P>
   Consider using face paint or makeup instead of a mask, which can
obstruct vision. If a mask is a must, cut the eye holes wide enough
so your child can see clearly in all directions.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Boost visibility &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   Make sure trick-or-treaters can still see and be seen when the
sun goes down.
</P>
<P>
   Use bright or light-colored costumes that can be spotted easily
by drivers. Add color to all-black outfits by persuading your child
to wear fluorescent tights. And give your child a flashlight to
help her navigate.
</P>
<P>
   Secure reflective tape or stickers to costumes (brands
identified as ``retro-reflective'' work the best).
</P>
<P>
   If you can't incorporate reflective tape into your child's
costume, put some on her shoes or treat bag.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Devise a game plan &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   Before you set out trick-or-treating with kids, map a route of
familiar homes to visit and set a time limit. Get an early start
with young kids so you can be home before it's too dark.
</P>
<P>
   Remind kids not to dart into the street or cross between parked
cars-a risk when they're overexcited.
</P>
<P>
   Tell them to stop at corners and look left, right and left
before crossing.
</P>
<P>
   Evaluate your child's maturity before letting him trick-or-treat
without you. Most kids under 10 aren't ready to go it alone, says
Dr. Marilyn J. Bull, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics'
section on injury and poison prevention.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Check the loot &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   Halloween's a time for treats, but be cautious. Inspect all
candy before kids start snacking, and throw out anything
suspicious, says Pam Kreppel, a registered dietitian at Nassau
County Medical Center in East Meadow, N.Y. Toss cracked or crushed
candies and items with loose or tipped wrappers.
</P>
<P>
   Remove treats that pose a choking hazard to kids under 4, warns
Kreppel. These include chewy candies with nuts or caramel; round,
hard candies; lollipops; and small, loose treats like gum balls.
Safer bets are plain chocolate bars, pretzels, or chocolate-covered
wafers.

<P>
   True, it's no trip to Disneyland. But taking your kids to the
grocery store can be fun _ and educational. Try these tips the next
time you're low on milk and bread:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Before you go &LR; : &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Create a ``just for kids'' project to shop for. Whether you're
making a lemonade stand, cutting stamps from potatoes or creating a
shaving-cream sculpture, ask your child to add the necessary
supplies to the grocery list. Looking for ``her'' special items
will help keep interest high.
</P>
<P>
   Plan ahead. Schedule your trip when everyone is well-rested. And
eat a healthy snack before you go to brighten everyone's mood and
make that candy aisle a little more resistible.
</P>
<P>
   Ask questions. On the way to the store, talk about your grocery
list. Ask younger children ``What shape are oranges?'' and ``What
color is a box of Cheerios?'' Recognizing shapes, colors and logos
is a great pre-reading exercise.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; At the store &LR; : &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Look for kid-sized carts. Many stores now have carts sized just
for the younger set. Your child will have fun adding ``his'' items
to his own cart.
</P>
<P>
   Give your child choices. Asking ``Should we get peas or green
beans?'' teaches decision-making skills and makes your child feel
important.
</P>
<P>
   Make learning fun. Preschoolers love to match items with
coupons. Once you're in the correct aisle, give your child a hint
about where the item is. Older kids can help compare unit prices to
find the best value.
</P>
<P>
   Use your senses. Younger kids are eager to learn about shapes,
textures and smells. Let them help you fill a bag with apples.
Teach them how to ``thump'' a cantaloupe and listen to the sound.
Smell the lemons together. Encourage your child to use all her
senses.
</P>
<P>
   Goof off! Wave at babies in passing carts. Make up a song about
bananas. With older kids, fun often equals challenge. Ask them
``How many different vegetables can you name in one minute?'' or
``If you ran your own store, what would you sell?''
</P>
<P>
   Teach money management. You may want to allow an older child to
spend a set amount of money on a treat. Learning to wisely spend a
limited amount of money is good lesson for every child. Even
better: Stop by the magazines or the children's book area and allow
your child to choose an item.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Back home &LR; : &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keep little hands busy. Older children can put away
non-breakable items. For added fun, have them play ``beat the
clock'' with a kitchen timer. By asking younger kids to ``put all
the vegetables in a pile'' or ``stack all the paper products by the
closet,'' you're teaching important concepts _ while giving
yourself time to put the ice cream in the freezer.
</P>
<P>
   Reward yourselves! Whether it's enjoying a cup of cocoa at the
kitchen table or making those potato stamps, take 15 minutes with
your kids to unwind and say thanks for a job well done!

<P>
   NEW YORK _ What has 30,000 slightly crazed participants, more
than 2 million spectators and 40 bands along miles of streets all
over New York City?
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Marathon, of course, with this year's 29th
running Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But the race is not just for New Yorkers. About half of the
American participants, from 7,000 to 10,000 men and women, come
from elsewhere in the United States. Another 10,000 are foreign
runners; last year 95 other countries were represented, led by
France, Germany and Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   As this mass of humanity spreads along the route, runners see
parts of New York that many natives never see in their lifetimes,
let alone in one day. And runners are cheered on by spectators
sometimes 10 deep along the sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in Staten Island, the race goes through Brooklyn,
Queens, into Manhattan, briefly into the Bronx and back into
Manhattan, finishing after 26.2 miles at Tavern on the Green in
Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   Lately the scene at the 10:40 a.m. start has been a wild one. So
many runners throng the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge that many have to
walk the first mile, with times running as long as 10 minutes. On
the plus side: In clear weather from the bridge's mid-point runners
have a spectacular view of the city, one you'll never get from a
tour bus and perhaps not even from an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Each neighborhood has its history and quirks. Staten Island is
New York's forgotten borough and home of a succession movement.
Brooklyn, founded in 1636, was New York's rival until its
annexation 100 years ago. Queens was named for Catherine Brahanza,
King Charles II's queen. The Bronx is home (for now) of the New
York Yankees (an election will decide the fate of a stadium
proposed for Manhattan's West Side). And to reach that finish line
in Manhattan is, as the song goes, ``to be a part of it, New York,
New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Finishing is the best part of the marathon. The worst, of
course, is hitting The Wall, too often the fate of runners who get
caught up in pre-race excitement. The best advice for average
runners is go out slow, remain steady and save something for the
end.
</P>
<P>
   The wall of fatigue is usually found in the Bronx around the
20-mile mark. The crowds are sparse; the elite runners have already
finished. It's you and the road, and you have to tough it out
mentally to keep going.
</P>
<P>
   Here you might regret having told yourself beforehand, I have to
do three hours or a personal best. Finishing is an accomplishment
in itself.
</P>
<P>
   (I know firsthand. In my first and only marathon, I ran New York
at age 40. My goal was breaking three hours. At the end, I was
happy just to cross the finish line, at three hours 41 minutes.)
</P>
<P>
   For your efforts, there's a medal and a long look back at what
you accomplished. And, in passing, a streetwise tour of the five
boroughs. Better than a tourist bus any day.

DOESN'T THE PRESIDENT KNOW IT'S RUDE TO CUT IN LINE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ If Bill Clinton, who needs all the help he can
get to survive in office, is trying to make friends among the
American people, he's messed up today almost completely. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here I am on an airplane jetting from Burlington, Vt., (on a
recent Friday) to the City of Brotherly Love, where I hope to run
from one gate to another in time to catch a flight home to Kansas
City. Whether my luggage will make the tight connection is anyone's
guess. But I've quit worrying about that. After all, my luggage
often takes longer vacations than I do. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The problem, however, is that the pilot has just come on the
public address system to tell us that our landing will be delayed
20 minutes or more because we'll be circling up here in the clouds.
The air space, he explains, has been cleared over the Philadelphia
airport to allow Air Force One to land. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The president is flying to Philly from a fund-raising trip to
Cleveland (where he took in about $200,000 over lunch in a private
home). His job here in Pennsylvania is to raise half a million
dollars for the Democratic party. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (If I were in charge of his schedule I'd also have him
investigate why the Eagles and Phillies are so bad, but let it
go.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I know that the 100-plus people on this plane would be glad to
donate a few bucks to almost any cause if we could get where we
want to go on time. But nobody passes through the aisles of my
flight to take up a collection. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We all understand that from time to time the president of the
United States, who no doubt gets antsy sitting around Washington,
D.C., awaiting his possible political execution, feels like getting
out of town. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If I worked in Washington I'd be looking for excuses to spend
time elsewhere, too. (Even, if it comes to that, in Philadelphia.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And we know that presidents almost never get out of town on
railroads any more. Nor do they go to their three-limo garage, load
up the family bullet-proof sedan and jump on a nearby interstate
highway. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they travel by Air Force One. And the American people
wouldn't have it any other way. We don't want our chief executives
(even ones we want to boot out of office) to have to slum it. They
may be bums, but, darn it, they're our bums. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, why does the president's unscheduled airliner get to land
ahead of all the scheduled commercial flights that are trying to
get people to business appointments or _ in the case of my wife and
me _ back home from a vacation trip? It's not right. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I know there are security concerns. Terrorism is real.
Loonies with surface-to-air missiles might well try to take out a
presidential jet, short-circuiting the impeachment process. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But how many terrorists sit around near the Philadelphia airport
on the off-chance that Air Force One might wander in? And if you
clear the air of every plane but the president's, isn't it more
likely terrorists would have a clear shot at it? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After droning around up here for a while, the pilot comes back
on to say we've finally been cleared to land. So down we come
through the partly cloudy, and as we near touch-down (about which
the Eagles here seem to know little), the guy sitting to my right
nudges me and points out the window. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There it is,'' he says. ``Air Force One.'' He's right. There
it is. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And I'm thinking: Hey, Mr. President. You want us average
Americans to support your anti-impeachment drive? Well, go ahead
and fly in your fancy plane, but tell your pilot to get in line
with the rest of our planes for landing sequence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and no making eyes at the flight attendants. &QL;

WHEN SOLO QB ISN'T ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I bet this has happened to you.
</P>
<P>
   You're sitting on the couch watching your favorite NFL game,
waiting for the scores to scroll across the bottom of the screen.
This week, Brett Favre was off, so you took a chance with Buffalo
quarterback Rob Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The first scores appear. Buffalo and Indianapolis are tied, 0-0.
Nothing wrong with that. Johnson is just getting warmed up. Pretty
soon, the Colts will feel his special brand of wrath. Just a matter
of time.
</P>
<P>
   Tick, tick, tick. Your palms begin to sweat. The network breaks
in with a few quick highlights from other games. No sign of
Johnson. No sign of the Bills. No sign of anybody named Bill.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it's halftime. After pointless yammering from former
players _ all of whom have suffered several concussions _ we reach
the most crucial part of the halftime show: Bills-Colts highlights.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Flutie is throwing a touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm, you wonder. Why are they showing Canadian football
highlights on American television?
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, it sinks in. Flutie's not wearing one of those goofy CFL
uniforms. He's not even wearing his old Boston College uniform.
He's wearing a Buffalo Bills uniform. Johnson is sitting on the
bench, cradling bruised ribs.
</P>
<P>
   Expletive deleted.
</P>
<P>
   After sifting through the ashes of my torched FFL weekend, I
noticed that more than half the teams in the league have played
musical quarterbacks at one time or another.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Jets keep switching between Glenn Foley and Vinny
Testaverde, contingent upon whether Coach Bill Parcells can see his
shadow. Oakland has gone through three quarterbacks, including a
couple who will move on to promising careers as beer deliverymen
and food service technicians.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Hollas, repeat after me, ``You want fries with that?''
</P>
<P>
   In Baltimore, Eric Zeier has replaced Jim Harbaugh, whose body
is held together entirely with duct tape. Kerry Collins left
Carolina to pursue a career as a stand-up comic. (OK, he really
went to the Saints _ same difference). Rodney ``Re'' Peete now
flings the pigskin for the Beagles.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a fantasy owner to do? Well, in your league, you might
consider switching to team quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is relatively simple. Instead of selecting individual
quarterbacks (Y.A. Tittle, for example), you pick an entire team
(like the Chicago Staleys). You get the statistics from whoever
happens to show up and stand behind the center that day.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you started Johnson (don't rub it in) you would
have also have had Flutie, who gave Peyton Manning a lesson about
messin' with a quarterback on the verge of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, due to Flutie's limited knowledge of the Canadian
monetary system, he was being paid in something called ``beaver
bucks.'' Not accepted on the south side of Lake Erie.
</P>
<P>
   The team system won't help owners with good quarterbacks who
never get hurt, or if your quarterbacks come from a team like the
ugh, Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, if you're picking the Redskins, I would like to
invite you to play in my league _ immediately. &QL; 
Tip of the week
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota quarterback Randall Cunningham and his receivers
against the Deadskins secondary reminds me of a pack of wolves
being turned loose in a sausage factory. Whatever happens, it isn't
going to be pretty. &QL; 
Waiver wire
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, anybody who runs behind the mammoth Jacksonville
line will gain 100 yards, so I'd grab Jaguars rookie Tavian Banks.
He will spell Fred Taylor, whose shoulder injury will limit his
effectiveness this week. Buffalo wide receiver Eric Moulds would be
a nice pickup, despite the return of Andre Reed. In St. Louis, Amp
Lee could get the nod with everybody else in the backfield nursing
an injury. &QL; 
One-hit wonder
</P>
<P>
   This week it's my favorite ex-Cardinal, Carolina quarterback
Steve Beuerlein, who passed for 286 yards and three touchdowns
against Dallas. The Panthers stink on ice. &QL; 
Bill Muller's Fantasy Football notebook appears every Friday. He

BIG APPLE'S READY TO TAKE A OUT OF SAN DIEGO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ People here seem shocked to learn that Tony Gwynn has
never seen Yankee Stadium. I mean, everybody who's anybody has seen
Yankee Stadium, right? The Pope ... Jack Dempsey ... The Ritz
Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   That, though, is the essential beauty of New Yorkers. Their view
of the world has always had that tinge of ``Well, fine, but you
haven't seen us yet.'' They have known of Gwynn forever, since he
makes two trips to Shea Stadium every year, and because he has hit
.300 every year since that first unfortunate day in tee-ball back
in '61.
</P>
<P>
   But the World Series begins Saturday, and the locals believe the
San Diego Padres are finally going to see what New York really and
truly is. Not the New York the Mets inhabit _ that is, at least
these days, a sort of faux Gotham, a place not unlike your average
run-of-the-mill American burg.
</P>
<P>
   No, this is the New York where Frank Sinatra shouts at you
during batting practice, where the history alone makes it hard to
breathe, and where, thoughtfully, this Yankee team has come as
close to approaching those Yankee teams of the '20s, '30s, '40s and
'50s as any team ever.
</P>
<P>
   That's big. New York big. Bigger than the Giants ever were, or
the Knicks, or the Rangers, and never mind the Jets, Mets, Nets or
Islanders. These Yankees are New York the way New York used to be,
before it turned into, well, New York.
</P>
<P>
   And Tony Gwynn has never been here? Well, too bad for Tony
Gwynn.
</P>
<P>
   That's the sentiment here as the Series begins, with the two
most iconoclastic pitchers in the game prepared to face each other.
David Wells (who is pretty damned New York when you get right down
to it) and Kevin Brown (whose reputation is pretty damned New York
cab driver) go Saturday night to start an event that most people
believe will end with the Yankees meeting New York's every
expectation.
</P>
<P>
   That, ladies, gentlemen, boys, girls and street mimes, is saying
something.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, between now and first pitch you'll see a lot of tortured
numerology showing all the ways the Padres are doomed. Our
particular favorite is the one that shows that the only Series
since 1984 that lasted fewer than six games involved California
teams, and California teams lost all of them _ the '84 Padres, the
'88 and '90 A's, and the '89 Giants. This falls nicely into the
``See? Those West Coast types don't have the attention spans God
gave fruit flies'' theory that East Coasties like to cite when they
admit they don't pay much attention to us.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Padres seem like a much gamer underdog than you
might think, largely because they don't have a lot of guys who
blink in the spotlight, or worse, forget to blink entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to Gwynn. There is, as you know, no
legitimate case to be made for anyone else as the logical inheritor
of Ted Williams' place as the greatest hitter of his time. Gwynn's
place is secure, so he won't fail here because of flop sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he is likely to thrive in the Series because everyone is
looking at him, because his skills have never gone into remission
for much longer than the length of his disappointing National
League series against Atlanta. It is hard to imagine him shriveling
under the glare of David Wells, David Cone or even Orlando
Hernandez, hitting .091 and leaving a million runners on base. He
is Tony Gwynn, and he will like Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Padres have pitching, better pitching than
confronted the Yankees against the Rangers or Indians. It is
reasonable to think that the Padres won't be straining under those
0-2, 0-3 and 0-5 first-inning burdens the Indians did.
</P>
<P>
   That makes this at least a winnable series for San Diego. Not
necessarily a winning one, mind you, because the Yankees are just
as good as they seem. George Steinbrenner was remarkably prescient
when he ripped them after they lost their first three games of the
regular season, anticipating as he did that he would never get
another chance to chew them out on the back pages of the tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   These Yankees have a chance to give New York the feeling that it
seemed to have in the first 60 years of this century, then seemed
to lose as rival centers of culture, commerce and curse words
sprang up.
</P>
<P>
   This time, one suspects the city will be disappointed if the
Yankees don't clinch the Series in San Diego, after four or five.
To their way of thinking, that's what true New Yorkers do _ come
in, blow the joint down, and leave.
</P>
<P>
   So they will welcome Tony Gwynn to Yankee Stadium Saturday
night. It's nice when a prominent outworlder gets a chance to see
the sights one can only see in New York, especially when they do
not expect to see him a second time.

LITTLE TUVALU HOPING TO SELL ITS GOOD NAME
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Never mind the palm trees, the tiny archipelago of
Tuvalu is more basket case than tropical paradise. The necklace of
nine coral atolls strung across a huge swath of South Pacific is
the smallest nation on earth _ total land area, 10 square miles _
and ranks among the very poorest and most remote.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the bad news: Scientists warn that if polar ice
caps melt due to global warning, Tuvalu _ its highest point rising
barely 15 feet above ocean level _ will probably be the first
country swallowed by the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes a Canadian company with a marketing vision that might
transform Tuvalu into an economic titan. Not to mention giving it
financial wherewithal to keep itself literally above water.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Toronto-based .TV Corporation put up for bid what
many Tuvaluans believe is the country's most precious asset: its
good name. Or, more precisely, license to use Tuvalu's ``domain
name,'' the abbreviation assigned every nation for use in Internet
addresses.
</P>
<P>
   The domain name given the United States, for example, is ``us.''
For Canada, it's ``ca.'' For Japan, it's ``jp.'' And so on.
</P>
<P>
   Thus was lucky Tuvalu awarded the domain name ``tv.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a gift from God,'' said Prime Minister Bikenibeau
Paeniu.
</P>
<P>
   Probably no other acronym is more internationally known. TV
means the same thing to denizens of Boston, Bosnia, and Borneo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're providing Internet-savvy companies with the opportunity
to brand their web sites with one of the most recognized words in
the world,'' said Jason Chapnik, president and chief executive
officer of .TV Corp, chosen by Tuvalu to manage global marketing
and licensing of the catchy domain name.
</P>
<P>
   The obscure Polynesian microstate, populated by 10,000 souls,
and the small Canadian firm, which has fewer than 10 employees, are
hoping that thousands of companies will fork out tens of millions
of dollars for the right to affix the ``tv'' suffix to their
Internet address, or Web site.
</P>
<P>
   As Tuvalu Foreign Affairs Minister Pokia Tihala recently told
Wired magazine: ``CNN.com? No, no. How about CNN.tv?''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, there is no television in Tuvalu, whose
communications infrastructure consists of one AM radio station and
130 telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Selling of the suffix began Wednesday when .TV Corp opened its
Internet address, www.internet.tv, to companies willing to plunk
down $1,000 to register a name ending with ``tv.'' In cases where
more than one outfit seeks the same name, the Toronto firm will
auction off rights beginning Feb. 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Response has been fantastic,'' said Chapnik.
</P>
<P>
   Chapnik refused to disclose financial details of the deal with
Tuvalu, but said that the country will reap the largest share of
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Paeniu, the prime minister, recently told his countrymen that
the arrangement will bring Tuvalu an income of more than $60
million a year, catapulting it to the ranks of the richest nations
in the world, per capita.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, Tuvalu remains a poverty-wracked backwater whose
subsistence fisherfolk average a couple hundred dollars in a good
year. The islands also export a few tons of coconuts and copra. But
the economy really runs on foreign aid from Australia, New Zealand,
and Britain, scraping by on a $4 million-per-year budget.
</P>
<P>
   National priorities are raising living standards and finding a
way to keep the semisubmerged atolls from disappearing under the
waves. No other land is more threatened by the ``Greenhouse
effect'' that some scientists predict will melt portions of the
polar icecaps and raise ocean levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people are already dreaming about what to do with this
money,'' Paeniu &UR;  &LR; said. ``We want to help ourselves and other
nations of the South Pacific.''

LOUISIANA SENATOR FINDS SUCCESS IN THE MIDDLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Louisiana Senator John Breaux has seen one
Democratic colleague after another swept away by the Republican
sentiment that was washed over the South in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the Nov. 3 elections, he has this recipe for
survival:
</P>
<P>
   ``Get to the mainstream, moderate, middle of the road,'' said
Breaux, speaking in a slight Cajun accent native to his home
parish. ``And pledge to make government work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the fundamentals of the party, the goals of equal
opportunity and taking care of people who need help,'' said Breaux,
who is comfortably ahead in his reelection race. ``But if we have
problems with something like Medicare, and we need to change it to
save it, we've got to do it. We can't say we can never change.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern Democrats clearly can use some sort of change. The
party in recent years has made some moves toward the middle,
following the lead of the Democratic Leadership Council that Breaux
and his old friend Bill Clinton helped establish. ``Clinton took
our DLC mandate _ responsibility, opportunity, community _ and
carried Louisiana twice,'' Breaux said.
</P>
<P>
   But since Clinton's election in 1992, Democrats have lost eight
US Senate seats in the South, seeing their 15-7 advantage reversed
in six years.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades ago, Democrats held virtually every Senate seat in
the old Confederacy, giving the party a solid majority and
extending great power to such senior figures as Richard Russell and
Herman Talmadge in Georgia, John Stennis and James Eastland in
Mississippi, John Sparkman in Alabama, and Russell Long in
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic hegemony was first broken by the election of
Republicans in Texas and Tennessee and the defection of Senator
Strom Thurmond to the GOP in South Carolina. Then the
transformation gathered force.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans began to make big gains with the electorate in
the 1980s under Ronald Reagan,'' said Merle Black, a professor of
politics at Emory University. Though many states have no formal
party registration, Black said, exit polls in 1996 determined that
most white voters in the South call themselves Republicans and
identify with the party's conservative positions.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans had ``better candidates and aggressive campaigns
that appealed to the white swing voters,'' said Black, who
specializes in Southern politics.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic setbacks across Dixie during this decade are
directly related to the party's loss of power on Capitol Hill, and
there seems little chance that the Democrats will gain a Senate
seat in the region this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux, however, has been building seniority while other
Southern Democrats have been losing theirs. A fixture in Washington
since he was first elected to Congress in 1972 at age 28, Breaux
would become the region's senior Democrat if Senator Ernest
Hollings of South Carolina fails to win reelection next month.
</P>
<P>
   Though a steadfast Democrat, Breaux cannot be defined by
rankings that label legislators liberal or conservative. In the
last Congress, the National Journal rated him near 50 percent on
both liberal and conservative scales on economic and social issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an extremely sophisticated politician. He manages to go
down the middle,'' said Ed Renwick, director of the Institute of
Politics at Loyola University here. ``Breaux wheels and deals with
business, labor, all the power centers. He's very inclusive, and
that's difficult to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaux is so far ahead of his Republican opponent, state
Representative Jim Donelon, that no one has bothered to take a poll
since March, when Breaux was more than 40 points in front of any
rival.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux says Clinton's problems ``could make a difference'' in a
few contests, but not in Louisiana, where the Democratic Party has
remained strong because of a solid base of blacks and a
French-Catholic influence that makes moderate politics more
palatable than the harder-edged conservatism of the Protestant
right.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the South, there are only two closely contested
Senate races. Hollings holds a slight lead over his Republican
challenger, US Representative Bob Inglis, in the latest polls from
South Carolina. In North Carolina, Senator Lauch Faircloth, a
one-term Republican incumbent, is in a tough fight with John
Edwards, a trial lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Incumbents are expected to waltz to reelection in the other
Southern races. Senator Richard Shelby, who renounced the
Democratic Party and joined the GOP after Republicans gained
control of the Senate in 1994, is expected to win easily in
Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Senator Bob Graham is an overwhelming favorite to win
in Florida. In Georgia, Republican Senator Paul Coverdell is
comfortably in front of the Democratic candidate, Michael Coles.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat is expected to hold the seat in Arkansas being
vacated by Senator Dale Bumpers. Blanche Lambert Lincoln, a popular
former congresswoman who gave up her seat two years ago to give
birth to twins, is running 16 points ahead of Republican state
Senator Fay Boozman in the latest poll.

COOPERATION BOOSTING BOSTON-ULSTER LINKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Long regarded a hotbed of support for the Irish
Republican Army, the Boston area has evolved into a welcoming forum
where Northern Ireland's leaders can air their views, listen to
former enemies, and receive a remarkable array of practical
support.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, the top two officials in the new Northern
Ireland Assembly _ one Protestant, one Catholic _ sat side by side
in a New England Circle discussion at a downtown high-rise.
</P>
<P>
   In its wake, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams will visit Greater
Boston this weekend. Irish President Mary McAleese, a native of
Northern Ireland, will speak at the John F. Kennedy School of
Government today. And 13 business and community development leaders
from Boston, under the auspices of the Friends of Belfast, will jet
to Northern Ireland tomorrow for a three-day trade mission.
</P>
<P>
   In ways both economically practical and intellectually
enlightened, these trans-Atlantic links serve to bolster the
growing sense that Boston has become a Geneva-like venue where
thoughts on Northern Ireland's centuries-old differences and future
direction will receive a fair and serious hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this deep feeling for Ireland here and for a wish to
have the Troubles and the violence resolved,'' British
Consul-General James Poston said yesterday. ``There is a strong
identification of the people here'' with Northern Ireland ``and a
generosity of spirit which leads people to try constructively to do
something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   That ccoperation, which predates the Good Friday accord brokered
by US envoy George Mitchell of Maine, has a basis in many aspects
of Boston life. From universities to businesses, from charitable
groups to City Hall, Boston and Ulster have forged links that grow
stronger every week.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to providing forums where Northern Ireland's leaders
can speak their minds, Bostonians have worked behind the scenes to
help bring parties together and improve the Ulster economy. That
labor has taken root in myriad ways, including:
</P>
<P>
   _Hundreds of jobs provided by Massachusetts businesses in
Northern Ireland, primarily in computer-related industries.
</P>
<P>
   _The Belfast Trade Festival, a Boston show at which 42 Belfast
companies will tout their businesses. The event, scheduled for the
World Trade Center next month, will be the largest such show ever
held outside Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   _Ongoing training at Boston College for the legislators elected
to the Northern Ireland Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   _A Kennedy School program in leadership, with local internships,
that has attracted government, business and civic leaders from both
Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   _An initiative at Boston University led by Elizabeth Shannon,
the widow of former US Ambassador to Ireland William Shannon, that
has reached out to Northern Irish women, particularly those
involved in community affairs.
</P>
<P>
   _Continuing philanthropic support from the American Ireland
Fund, a Boston-based organization that has raised more than $100
million in 20 years. Just last week, the fund contributed $50,000
to a memorial fund for the victims of the August explosion in
Omagh, Northern Ireland, that killed 29 people and wounded 330.
</P>
<P>
   _Attention from the New England Circle. The wide-ranging
discussion group created 25 years ago by the Dunfey family
continues to invite key players from Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The roundtable heard this week from David Trimble, head of the
Ulster Unionist Party and first minister of the new provincial
assembly, and Seamus Mallon, a leader of the Catholic-oriented
Social Democratic and Labour Party and deputy first minister of the
assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Dunfey, president of the circle, said that the difference
in Trimble, compared with his last visit to Boston in 1994, was
striking.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was speaking a different language, even the smile. He
exuded warmth,'' Dunfey said after the event. ``Four years ago it
was his first time in Boston, and I think the pressure was on. The
whole situation was different.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the circle has heard from speakers that long
regarded themselves as enemies. From Sinn Fein leader Adams, the
political voice of the IRA, to loyalists once jailed for the
killings of Catholics, the views of blood foes have been heard in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no place else I know of in the world where people from
both communities in Northern Ireland come on a regular basis for
ideas, for financial support for their projects, and for academic
and intellectual pursuits,'' said Francis Costello, a former aide
to US Representative Joseph Kennedy 2d and ex-Mayor Raymond Flynn
who acts as a trade consultant for the city of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   Costello will be among the contingent leaving Boston tomorrow
for Ulster. With him will be John Cullinane, the computer software
pioneer and philanthropist whose generosity has, among other
things, helped the only Irish language high school in Belfast to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   The mission hopes to build on the momentum generated this week
when Segue Software of Lexington announced it will open a
tehcnical-support call center in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of work is beyond governments,'' Costello explained.
``It really requires a comfort level of an American company with
Belfast, to get them a sense that they are welcome and wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Massachusetts companies that have reached that comfort
level include Stream International, which has 250 computer-support
jobs in Derry, Northern Ireland; and Liberty Mutual Group, whose
chief executive officer, Belfast native Ted Kelly, was instrumental
in expanding to Ulster.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Leary of the Boston-based Irish American Partnership, a
group that promotes economic development, also has been active in
the type of work that British consul Poston called ``enlightened
self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's trade mission also will include Bostonians with
grassroots know-how such as Martin Nee, executive director of the
South Boston Neighborhood Development Corp., and William
Good, &UR;  &LR; chief of administrative services for the Boston Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Another New Englander helping to deal with the flashpoint issue
of police reform in Ulster is Kathleen O'Toole, the former
Massachusetts secretary for public safety who is serving on the
Northern Ireland Police Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the cross-ocean activity, the players in this
burgeoning partnership hope that interest in Northern Ireland will
not fade if the euphoria over the Good Friday accord dissipates
amid the hard work of institution-building.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're looking at now is for an entire society to begin
the process of repair, reconstruction and reconciliation,'' said
Kingsley Aikins, executive director of the American Ireland Fund.
``And that will take time because the wounds that have been left
from this very ugly and bitter civil war are very raw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope that people in North America don't forget about
Northern Ireland because there's an awful lot of work left to do.''

BIPARTISAN SHAM ON EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Public education, the abused afterthought of Capitol Hill, was
once again brought out of its dungeon for a ray of light, only to
be hurled back into the darkness with the spiders and cobwebs as
soon as Congress and the White House achieved the proper effect of
making people think they did something about it on the nearly
finished $500 billion spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans gave President Clinton $1.1 billion in the new
budget to hire 100,000 elementary school teachers to reduce class
size. It figures. The conservatives are always railing about the
futility of throwing money at social problems. Yet they gave
Clinton a victory destined to be labeled a failure.
</P>
<P>
   You could not tell that by the self-congratulations. Senator Ted
Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat, said the money was ``a
resounding victory for the children of this country. It's a
resounding victory for public education.'' Senate Democratic leader
Tom Daschle said the $1.1 billion was ``the biggest victory of all,
and the one we are most proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has made smaller classes a centerpiece of education
reform. Many education experts have scratched their heads,
wondering why. It seems logical that small classes produce smart
students, but there are yet few studies to actually prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Even if there were such studies, Clinton still has it backwards.
More teachers means nothing if they are not of the highest quality.
California, which two years ago began a drive to reduce class size
in the early grades from 30 students per class to 19, now has a
quagmire where 30 percent of public school teachers do not have
proper training or experience.
</P>
<P>
   More teachers also means little if there is no space to handle
schools that might shrink in class size but explode in room
numbers. On this score, the $500 billion spending package speaks
volumes. Clinton asked for $1 billion for school construction. The
$1 billion was part of Clinton's bid for a $5 billion, five-year
construction plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans refused. Clinton dropped the request.
</P>
<P>
   Thus we are about to get more teachers with nowhere to put them.
Three years ago, the General Accounting Office wrote that the
physical conditions of schools, ranging from lighting and heating
to air quality to physical security, are so bad it would take $112
billion over a three-year period to repair or upgrade them into
good condition. This year school districts started $15 billion in
building projects.
</P>
<P>
   That is woefully short of the $37.3 billion a year called for by
the GAO. When a Democratic president proposes so little to fix the
schools and a Republican-dominated Congress rejects even that, this
is not a ``huge win'' or a ``resounding victory.'' This is a
bipartisan sham.
</P>
<P>
   It is a sham because defense, already bloated with pork-barrel
projects that even the Pentagon has said it doesn't need, received
$9.7 billion in the spending package for military readiness, nearly
10 times more money than education. While 60 percent of American
schools have conditions that surely detract from student readiness
for the 21st century, affecting the ability to see, breathe,
concentrate, and feel safe, the defense budget includes $250,000
for ``pharmaco-kinetics research.''
</P>
<P>
   This ``research'' is actually a pork-barrel procurement of Stay
Alert caffeinated chewing gum in the Yorkville, Ill., hometown of
Republican Representative Dennis Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   While principals and school superintendents wait in vain for
what should be $37.3 billion a year for the next three years,
defense contractors are applauding an increase in procurement that
will give them $48.5 billion of business in fiscal 1999. In one
instance, Clinton asked for only one new C-130-J transport plane
from Lockheed. Congress decided to build six more at a cost of
nearly half a billion dollars. The plane factory just happens to be
next to House Speaker Newt Gingrich's district.
</P>
<P>
   At the last minute, senators and congressmen have reportedly
thrown in millions in the defense budget for businesses in their
home districts. A firm in Indiana that makes transmissions for
self-propelled howitzers that had lost a previous bid has
Republican Representative Peter Visclosky pushing to get it $4
million for research.
</P>
<P>
   Coal mining interests have Representative Paul Kanjorski, a
Pennsylvania Democrat, trying to add $4 million to Navy research to
``micronize'' coal to see if there are any uses for it. Senator Ted
Stevens, Republican of Alaska, is campaigning for $2.4 million in
Navy appropriations for a vacuum-pressure device that its inventor
claims will prevent oil spills but has been scoffed at by the Coast
Guard.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same Congress that tells you that it can deal with
education in only a piecemeal and wrongheaded way. House minority
leader Richard Gephardt said, ``We are going to make education the
number one issue in the country.'' After what happened this week in
Washington, it is clear that education is already back in the
dungeon, rotting to a state that will be even more rank when
Capitol Hill pulls it out for the ray of light, a light that is
merely the flash of a photo op.

MAKING HISTORY AT BOSTON UNIVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Word arrives that Boston University will be the new
home of the breakaway Historical Society, a 750-member group of
historians protesting the ``politicization and trivialization'' of
their discipline by the larger American Historical Association and
the Organization of American Historians. The society thus becomes
the second major academic liberal arts organization to find a home
on the Silber side of the Charles. The 1,800-member Association of
Literary Scholars and Critics, a stop-the-madness group of
academics disaffected with the faddish critical trends espoused by
the larger Modern Language Association, is dominated by BU types.
</P>
<P>
   Could Boston University become the Yale of the new millennium,
i.e., the premier liberal arts university of America? Anything is
possible. ...
</P>
<P>
   The brainchild of Atlanta University historian Eugene Genovese
and Yale classicist Donald Kagan, the 5-month-old society was
casting about for a home when BU stepped forward. President Jon
Westling has offered the society office space and a faculty
appointment for a historian to teach and work as executive director
for the group. In May, BU will host the society's first national
conference. Overall, ``the university has been extraordinarily
generous,'' says Genovese.
</P>
<P>
   Local eminentos who have thrown in with the Historical Society
include MIT's Pauline Maier, Mary Lefkowitz of Wellesley, Morton
Keller of Brand X _ sorry _ Brandeis, BU's William Keylor, and
Oscar Handlin, Richard Pipes, and John Womack of Harvard.

   Boston's always whining that it can't lure big-time

the National Funeral Directors Association!
</P>
<P>
   My new best friend Kelly Smith, spokesman for the 15,000 member
NFDA, says his members are real live wires and promises
``everything from caskets to urns to embalming paraphernalia'' when
the Funereal Ones converge on the Hynes Auditorium Oct. 26, 27, and
28. There will be seven book signings, including one by Thomas
Lynch, author of the well-received ``The Undertaking: Life Studies
from the Dismal Trade.'' But I'm going to opt for Myrtle
Westmoreland promoting her tome, ``I Married a Funeral Director.''
</P>
<P>
   But wait _ there's more! Seminars on ``Hot Topic for Your
Future: Installing a Crematory''; ``Putting All Your Eggs in one
Casket: Understand Innovating Funeral Service Pricing,'' and ``Show
me the Money: Financing for Independents.'' An accompanying media
guide urges hacks like me ``to be respectful of the sensitive
nature of death and funeral services.'' Jessica Mitford and Evelyn

   Most helpfully, the ICTBC Web site tells you how to organize

<P>
   ``People in Canada's heartland know what it is to be cool.
Resourceful individuals from Winnipeg and surrounding areas made it
through a winter storm to attend the launch of Cool to be Canadian

UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MEDICAL SCHOOL AT HOUSTON ON ITS WAY UP 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 18) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RUTH SoRELLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, the University of Texas Medical School at Houston has
labored under the sobriquet ``young.''
</P>
<P>
   Voted into being by the Texas Legislature in 1969, it has on
occasion been racked by open turf battles that spilled onto the
news pages. When compared to its older neighbor Baylor College of
Medicine, the school has been described as striving and ``number
two.''
</P>
<P>
   But with relative peace prevailing in recent years _ and with
this week's designation of its new chairman of integrative biology
as a Nobel Prize winner _ UT-Houston Medical School appears on its
way up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the exclamation point on the statement `We have arrived
_ finally. We are mature,' '' said Dr. M. David Low, president of
UT-Houston Health Science Center, which oversees the medical
school.
</P>
<P>
   Low and others credit the recent recruitment of Dr. Ferid Murad,
the Nobel winner announced Monday, as a signal that the school is
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Murad had been running a small biotech firm outside of Chicago,
but found little time for research, his first love. A search
committee looking for a chairman for the school's integrative
biology department sought him out. In the end, he was the
committee's top pick, said Low.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a lot of time and effort and convincing,'' he said.
``For most people of that caliber, the most important think they
have to believe is that their scientific future is secure.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading the effort were the school's dean, Dr. Maximillian Buja,
and chairman of the medicine department, Dr. James Willerson.
Willerson had known Murad when the two were interns and residents
at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Murad had helped in an attempt to recruit Willerson to Stanford
University during the mid-1980s. When it came time for Willerson to
turn the tables, he was dogged.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is extremely bright and very hard-working,'' Willerson said
of Murad. ``He is committed to doing everything well, and he wants
everything around him to be done well. He is ambitious for the
health science center and the medical center. He wants both to
progress, and he will do everything he can to make sure they
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Willerson and Low both see Murad's Nobel status as a way to
attract better and brighter researchers, residents and students to
the school.
</P>
<P>
   Low sees three benefits:
</P>
<P>
   Publicity for the institution with stories worldwide identifying
Murad as a UT-Houston scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Exposure for the institution in the world of science, which can
translate into more high-caliber scientists seeking to come here.
</P>
<P>
   Easier access to foundations, corporations and drug companies
that can help finance basic research at the various institutions of
the health science center.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Low sees the award casting a positive light on the
entire Texas Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was musing on a motto we might try to promote, not just for
us but maybe for the whole medical center,'' he said. `` `Come work
or learn with the best.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Low hopes that more Nobel prizes will come in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Texas Medical Center has been home to two Nobel
Prize winners.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Roger Guillemin was at the Salk Institute in La Jolla,
Calif., when he won the Nobel in 1977. But he had done the seminal
work that won him the award while at Baylor College of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Murad did the work that won him the Nobel at the University of
Virginia and Stanford, but he was at UT-Houston Medical School when
he received the award.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to grow our own Nobelists,'' said Low. ``The
next step is to get a Nobel Prize based on work done here and have
the Nobel laureate stay here.

IT'S NOT EASY TO SIT THROUGH, BUT ``BELOVED'' IS MAGNIFICENT

<P>
   ``Beloved'' is a strong, dark, tangled powerhouse of a film that
comes to grips with the scars of slavery as no previous American
film has. It isn't easy to sit through, not because it runs nearly
three hours, but because the journey it takes is a slow and heavy
and sad one as it traces an enduring woman's tremendous effort to
put a lacerating and degrading past behind her eight years after
emancipation. It could almost be so-called emancipation, for Oprah
Winfrey's aching matriarch named Sethe still is imprisoned by the
pain of her past. One of her daughters is literally imprisoned in
their small house on the outskirts of Cincinnati, never leaving it.
</P>
<P>
   It's a haunted house, and director Jonathan Demme, maintaining a
meticulous fidelity to its source, Toni Morrison's landmark novel,
jolts us with ``Exorcist''-like effects that yank us into its
agitated soul. ``Beloved,'' however, is anything but an F/X
extravaganza. It's a love story and a ghost story of tormented
mother love, as Sethe feels both longing and guilt about Beloved,
the daughter she lost years ago when a Kentucky slaver caught up
with a runaway Sethe and exacted ugly and brutal revenge. The house
isn't an evil house, Sethe explains to Danny Glover's Paul D., a
slave alongside Sethe on the same plantation, who has sought her
out years later. It's just a sad one.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of two visitors who arrive at her door. The other is a
mysterious young woman played by Thandie Newton, who, dressed in
black and accompanied by a cloud of insects, staggers stiff-legged
to Sethe's front yard and collapses there like a broken rag doll.
Sethe takes her in and nurses her back to health. When her visitor
says in a cracked, otherworldly voice that her name is Beloved, the
same as Sethe's lost daughter, Sethe doesn't know what to think. Is
it her daughter back from the dead? Is her spirit resurfacing in
ways she can't fathom? Beloved's rolling eyes, animal growls, and
contorted features that sometimes subside into angelic repose
deepen the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The result is not resolution, at least not before much struggle.
It is the joint triumph of Winfrey and Demme that they convey the
pain and will to survival of a woman who has endured by maintaining
iron control. It isn't hardship that threatens to break her _ she's
used to that _ but tenderness. She and Glover's sweet, decent old
friend share a sex scene that is remarkable in its ability to
convey mutual solace. Eventually, the strong currents in the house
overwhelm Glover's gentle, open-hearted Paul D., but not before he
melts away some of the isolation permeating the place. There's
another sex scene that does not involve Sethe, and that one is
violent and scary.
</P>
<P>
   The house is a metaphor for Sethe, embodying, as it does,
sanctuary and continuity but also a profound malaise. Winfrey and
Demme never get so caught up with turning Sethe into an icon that
they scant visceral impact in the primal scenes, especially the
ones involving Newton's needy but increasingly wild creature whose
escalating unrest drives the story toward its climax. The
flashbacks are necessarily horrific in this story about the
internal devastation of slavery, including Morrison's irony in
calling the soul-crushing plantation Sweet Home. Winfrey is a
bulwark of strength as Sethe, filling the screen with fiery
commitment and oaken commitment, but never descending to
sentimentality or pathos.
</P>
<P>
   Admirably, the film tries to replicate Morrison's dense,
elliptical, incantatory construction. The danger it faces is
stasis. Sethe doesn't travel the usual arc of change we're used to
seeing in screen narratives. She is a woman essentially standing
her ground, or rather trying to find the strength to keep standing
it. Apart from being the driving force behind this film and its
genuflection to African-American endurance, Winfrey's
identification with Sethe's struggles results in wave after wave of
unstoppable conviction. She delivers a full-blooded performance of
enormous dignity that has Oscar contender written all over it.
</P>
<P>
   Glover's Paul D. will steal your heart, and Newton is amazing as
the enigmatic and otherworldly Beloved, never seeming merely showy,
despite the primal convulsiveness of her fiery, unpredictable
Beloved. It would be idle to pretend that the film doesn't
sometimes lose momentum, partly because the strength of its central
character consists not in going with the flow, but resisting it.
But its depth and quality and fidelity to Morrison's novel make it
a distinguished film. And to cap the succession of things Demme
does right, the film does come around to the largely silent and
watchful daughter played by Kimberly Elise.
</P>
<P>
   She, after all, represents the future. Although she doesn't say
much, she's always a vivid, watchful presence who obviously has
inherited her mother's strength. And it's thanks to that strength
that what could have been an anticlimactic ending becomes a
liberating one. Few films this year are likely to have the size and
reach and redemptive riches of ``Beloved.'' It has flaws, it has
imperfections, but it also achieves a magnificence few films even
attempt. You'd be missing an important work if you were to pass it
by.

FAST-GROWING COMPANY IS ALSO A MAJOR GIVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ It's not standard business procedure for a
company to donate half its annual profits to charities. But don't
tell that to Give Something Back, a 6-year-old office supply
company that made Inc. magazine's latest list of the 500
fastest-growing private companies in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The company's two founders, Mike Hannigan and Sean Marx, are
true businessmen rather than just do-gooders. They say they run a
tight operation and have plans to expand Give Something Back into a
national chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``As aggressive as we have been in growing, we're actually
financially very conservative,'' said Hannigan, who previously
worked for Xerox and other copy product companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the nonprofit community, and the community in
general, will be better off if we focus on growth and can
eventually give away millions instead of just tens of thousands of
dollars,'' explained Marx, a former sales representative in the
copy supply business.
</P>
<P>
   Their company, which ranks 498th on the Inc. list, has donated
to food banks and the Habitat for Humanity, among others. In all,
the company plans to give away $250,000 to dozens of groups in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Hyatt, a senior editor at Inc. who is in charge of the
top-500 edition, said no other company on the list is so focused on
giving as the Oakland-based company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously there are companies that give something back, but
they don't usually put it foremost in their names,'' he said. ``It
is an extreme version of what some socially conscious companies
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hannigan, 49, and Marx, 32, met while working together in the
copier products industry. Hannigan approached Marx about starting
some kind of business based on the model of Newman's Own, the
spaghetti sauce and salad dressing company started by actor Paul
Newman that donates its profits to charities.
</P>
<P>
   The two decided to capitalize on their background in office
products as the basis for the company. They each pitched in $20,000
from personal savings to start the company.
</P>
<P>
   In the competitive world of office supply, Give Something Back
has managed to stand up to mega-office supply companies such as
Office Depot and OfficeMax by offering competitive pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Give Something Back has no retail locations and limited
warehouse space (the company mostly ships directly to clients) and
therefore has low overhead.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Hannigan and Marx say they cap their own salaries
at 75 percent of the industry average, or $6,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Arlington, Va.-based Business Products Industry
Association, about 14,000 commercial office supply stores existed
nationwide eight years ago. Fewer than half remain as of this year,
a reduction attributed to consolidation in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Give Something Back gives away all the profits left over after
taxes and retained earnings for growth. Essentially, the company's
managers keep enough money to be able to grow and keep their bank
from getting nervous, and give the rest away.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the company made $330,000 in net profit and gave away
$154,000. In 1997, earnings were $350,000 of which $160,000 was
donated. In 1999, the company expects to make about $500,000 and
donate $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sales growth has increased from $5 million in 1996 to more than
$13 million projected for this year. Sales goals for 1999 are $22
million, with more than $1 million in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Hannigan said the 1996 opening of the first sales office outside
the San Francisco Bay area, in Sacramento, cut into 1997 profits.
Additional sales offices are planned for the Santa Clara-San Jose
area, San Diego and Portland, Ore.

FRAUGHT WITH DYSFUNCTION, ``TRINITY'' NEEDS PLOT DOCTOR
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRINITY &QC; 
Starring: Tate Donovan, Jill Clayburgh, John Spencer, Sam Trammell,
Justin Louis, Kim Raver, Bonnie Root, Charlotte Ross &QC; 
On: NBC, Ch.7 &QC; 
Time: Friday at 9 &QC; 
Rated: TV14 &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heavy is the word for ``Trinity,'' the new series from ``ER''
executive producer John Wells. ``Trinity'' is so crammed with
dysfunction and drama that it makes other hourlong dramas like
``NYPD Blue'' and ``Chicago Hope'' appear lighthearted. It
out-heavies even Wells's own intubation-fixated ``ER,'' presenting
us with such a glut of emotional and spiritual and criminal traumas
that it verges on self-parody. The themes in the premiere episode
alone _ alcoholism, adultery, unwanted pregnancy, a failing
marriage, sibling rivalry, union corruption, police intrigue,
religious quandary, a gay husband _ read like a list of chapters in
a book called ``Modern Urban Life,'' or, more specifically, ``TV
Cliches of Modern Urban Life.''
</P>
<P>
   All the heaviness of ``Trinity,'' which debuts tonight at 9 on
Ch.7, centers around the McCallister family, an Irish-Catholic clan
in New York's Hell's Kitchen. Each of the five adult children is a
familiar TV type who offers enough turmoil for a show of his or her
own. Kevin, played by Tate Donovan, is a liberal-minded priest who
plays basketball when he's not hearing confession. Like Kevin
Anderson on last season's ``Nothing Sacred,'' he makes waves with
his unconventional thinking. Bobby is the gritty cop who provides a
touch of ``NYPD Blue,'' neglecting his wife as he combs the streets
for clues to the death of another McCallister brother years ago.
Liam, the stock soap-opera hothead, works for a crooked union
organizer when he's not making eyes at Bobby's wife. Fiona is
another soap cliche, a high-powered, self-destructive stockbroker
who is having an affair with her married boss. And poor tatooed
Amanda is a pregnant substance abuser who is unsure of the identity
of the father.
</P>
<P>
   It's a hard show to warm up to, even while the TV season has
offered very little for fans of drama. There's simply not an
ordinary or sweet moment in the entire hour of ``Trinity,'' nor is
there one next week, as each of the siblings' subplots is forwarded
with equal thrust. With all of the action and conflict and
characters, none of the stories is given the chance to be fleshed
out or affecting. And what makes ``Trinity'' feel even more
cluttered is the way the lives of the siblings are so mixed
together. It's an unbelievably small world, this TV-ized Hell's
Kitchen, with the characters forever bumping into one another and
involved in one another's business. The acting on the show is fine
on all counts, but Wells will need to do some serious plot
doctoring and character nursing to turn ``Trinity'' around.
</P>
<P>
   The McCallister brood gathers for fraught dinners at the
apartment of their parents, played by John Spencer and Jill
Clayburgh. Neither of the elder McCallisters have been given much
screen time, but next week Clayburgh has a salient moment as she
asks her husband, ``When do we get to stop worrying about these
kids?'' At this pace, Mom, never.

GERMAN VIOLINIST CHRISTIAN TETZLAFF CARES ABOUT HIS CRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week Christian Tetzlaff is playing a new concerto, for him,
with Bernard Haitink and the Boston Symphony Orchestra _ the
Sibelius. ``This isn't the very first time I am playing it,'' the
young German violinist said in his dressing room before rehearsal
Tuesday. ``I wouldn't come here with a concerto for the first time
_ I have played it in London and Helsinki already. This is a
concerto I didn't learn during my student time, so I have been
occupied with it for most of the last two years. You can learn
things more quickly when you are a student; there are fewer
distractions and you have real time to practice. I have never heard
a live performance of this concerto, and I listen to recordings
very little, so I did not really know it when I took it up two
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Tetzlaff is a meticulous craftsman who is noted for his ability
to master problem concertos and deliver their messages to the
public. He made his name with the Schoenberg (his American debut
was in this work, with the Cleveland Orchestra); with the BSO he
played the Schumann, the Berg, and the Ligeti before arriving at
the standard repertory with an incandescent performance of the
Beethoven at Tanglewood last summer.
</P>
<P>
   With a disarming smile, Tetzlaff admits that he was not always
so meticulous. He started to study the violin and the piano at 6.
``I was always interested in music, but far too little interested
in the violinistic things. I was 15 before I started to work
seriously; before that I was satisfied to be quite quick to pick
things up.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the judges of a competition in which Tetzlaff played was
Uwe-Martin Haiberg from the Lubeck Conservatory; one result of the
competition was that Tetzlaff went to work seriously on technique
and repertory with Haiberg. ``About 40 percent of our work was on
the technical side; the rest was music.'' Haiberg suggested that
Tetzlaff study all his concertos from the full orchestral score,
which is not the way most celebrity violinists are trained. ``This
has had many good consequences, and maybe a few that were not so
good. To be a successful performer, you have to feel good on the
stage, to be absolutely secure about the technical aspect of your
playing. It has taken me a long time to feel really comfortable
onstage.''
</P>
<P>
   Many prodigy-soloists have no idea of what it might be like to
participate in chamber music or play in an orchestra. Tetzlaff did
both. ``For 10 years, from the time I was 10 until I was 20 I
played in various youth orchestras, and I came for a year to the
Cincinnati College-Conservatory to study with Walter Levin of the
LaSalle Quartet.'' Levin's most prominent pupil was not a
violinist, but a young pianist named James Levine who wanted to be
a conductor. Tetzlaff has conducted some of his own performances of
the Mozart Violin Concertos, but says he has ``no ambitions in that
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Tetzlaff is 32; his countrywoman, Anne-Sophie Mutter, who is
just three years older, burst into the international spotlight many
years earlier than Tetzlaff because of the patronage of Herbert von
Karajan. ``My career was different; every year it became a little
bit more. There was no big event that made my career go; mostly I
got reinvited wherever I went. There was never a conductor who
said, `You are my boy.' There is no way I could have worked with
Karajan _ I was fiercely dedicated to a way of working that was
exactly the opposite of his. At the end of his career, Karajan was
obsessed with sound, and with greatness _ the greatness of the
music and his own greatness. ... The only one of the old conductors
I worked with was Sergiu Celibidache.''
</P>
<P>
   The concerto on that occasion was the Schoenberg; one was
surprised to learn that this was a work Celibidache knew. ``He
didn't,'' says Tetzlaff, shooting another grin. Cleveland's
Christoph von Dohnanyi was the first of the prominent international
conductors to engage Tetzlaff; last summer was his first appearance
with Seiji Ozawa; this week's concerts bring him his first concerts
with Haitink. Tetzlaff is quite impressed with the caliber of some
of the younger conductors he has worked with recently _ Britain's
22-year-old Daniel Harding, Antonio Pappano, Kent Nagano. ``This is
a very good generation of conductors.''
</P>
<P>
   Tetzlaff's devotion to the style of the composers has not led
him into experiments with old violins, bows, and ``historically
informed performance.'' ``I do not think some of those things are
necessary; on the other hand, you should not play Mozart without
reading the treatise about violin playing by his father Leopold.
Some traditions of violin playing are necessary; you need tradition
to tell you how to do certain things. But you don't have to belong
to the `Russian school' or the `Belgian school' or the `American
school.' You should be like an actor who gets into the style of
each of his parts.''
</P>
<P>
   And as for old instruments, Tetzlaff says, ``I prefer to
experiment with new violins.'' He has played old Italian
instruments, but will perform the Sibelius on a recent violin by
Peter Greiner that he acquired last New Year's Eve. ``I am using
this instrument because it is strong and nice; it sounds good.''
</P>
<P>
   Tetzlaff says he finds Sibelius a ``fantastic composer; his
music is very direct and emotional, but it is also written with
compositional skill. Some of Sibelius sounds quite modern, although
he did not take a way out of tonality like Schoenberg, Stravinsky,
or Bartok. Maybe it was for that reason serious people like the
critic Theodor Adorno attacked his music and called it rubbish. The
concerto is very physical, very wild, and you have to play the
violin in a different way; at the same time you have to understand
how vital the orchestra is _ there's a place in the slow movement
where you are playing the accompaniment, although some violinists
mistake it for the real thing. I do not think I would like to play
the Sibelius on a 10-concert tour; there would be too much
brain-ache and there is also the danger of muscle-ache!''
</P>
<P>
   The Schoenberg concerto is one of the pieces that put Tetzlaff
on the map. ``I learned it when I was 20, not for a performance,
but because I think it belongs among all the other major concertos.
I haven't played it in a long time now because there has to be a
very good conductor and a very good orchestra and enough rehearsal
time. I'm looking forward to playing it later this month in Hamburg
with Christoph von Eschenbach.'' Today Tetzlaff plays about 85
concerts a year. Last season he played the Mendelssohn Concerto 24
times, the Beethoven 22, using his own transcription of the
cadenzas Beethoven wrote for the version of the concerto he
prepared for piano _ he was not amused at Tanglewood to be
criticized in some quarters for the ``inappropriateness'' of a
cadenza that Beethoven wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He says he doesn't tire of the standard concertos. ``Every
single time I'm fascinated; every day you feel a little bit
different. I really enjoyed playing the Mendelssohn so often; you
are telling a story to the people who are listening, and your job
is to make it believable every time. There are some concertos I
love that I could not play so often: the Berg, for example, where
the feelings are so strong that to reproduce them night after night
would be very difficult.'' Tetzlaff has another ``new'' concerto in
his repertory, along with the Sibelius, the Shostakovich First; in
2000 he will play the premiere of the first concerto written
specifically for him, a work by Johannes Harneit.
</P>
<P>
   Home is outside Frankfurt. Tetzlaff's wife plays clarinet in the
Frankfurt Opera Orchestra, and they have three children, age 6, 4,
and 1. That is one reason why Tetzlaff controls his schedule
rigorously. ``If I work a week, I have to take a week off. My
children, my wife, and my home are the center of my life, and when
I am not there, I miss them.''

DOGGED PURSUIT OF NEW INFORMATION CHARACTERIZES NOBEL WINNER MURAD
AND HIS SUCCESS 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 18) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RUTH SoRELLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ After Dr. Ferid Murad learned he had won the Nobel
Prize for Medicine Monday morning, he still set aside 30 minutes to
meet with the trainees and scientists in his lab to discuss some
``fantastic data'' that one had uncovered over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Those close to him say it is a mark of the man that he would
take time on such a day for the younger scientists he is training.
It also is proof of his wife's assertion that the Nobel will not
change him or divert him from his single-minded pursuit of what he
loves _ science.
</P>
<P>
   Murad, 62, put it more simply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a data freak,'' he confessed. ``I can't go a day without
hearing good new data.''
</P>
<P>
   The dogged pursuit of new information characterizes Murad and
his success, capped this week by science's most prestigious award.
Friends describe him as competitive, brilliant, unassuming and
mild. His wife calls him a ``regular guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Willerson, chairman of medicine at the University of
Texas Medical School at Houston, said he pushed for Murad's
recruitment as chairman of the school's new integrative biology
department because of that love of ``data'' _ particularly in his
field, dealing with biologic effects of a chemical called nitric
oxide.
</P>
<P>
   Murad spent most of his adult life pursuing the story of nitric
oxide, a colorless odorless gas best known as an air pollutant. He
and his co-winners _ Robert F. Furchgott and Louis J. Ignarro _
proved its fundamental role in cells throughout the body.
</P>
<P>
   Little remains controversial about nitric oxide now, but for 18
years, Murad fought for recognition of the tiny molecule's
importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unexpected that a free radical would work like this,''
said Murad, who maintained his work and studies despite the world
of medicine's indifference to his efforts.
</P>
<P>
   That is typical of him, said a lifelong friend, Ronald Delismon
of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were playing chess with him and he was losing, he never
gave up,'' said Delismon. ``He made you beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1990s, nitric oxide's importance became clear. In
1992, the journal Science named it molecule of the year. In 1996,
Furchgott and Murad received the Lasker Award, often dubbed the
American Nobel.
</P>
<P>
   Murad, new to Houston and UT, hopes his new celebrity will bring
grants and top-notch younger researchers to the school. But he
hopes the Nobel will not change him.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Murad, his wife of nearly 40 years, is confident it won't.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will go on doing the things he loves,'' she said. ``I'm
very proud of him.''
</P>
<P>
   The money from his share of the $978,000 prize will go toward
educating his five grandchildren and maybe to Indiana's DePauw
University, where he went on a full scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   One area of Murad's expertise that gets ignored frequently is
his skill as a physician, his wife said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won the prize for the `Art and Practice of Medicine' when
he was in medical school'' at Cleveland's Case Western University,
she said. ``In 1976, when I had a pulmonary embolism (a blood clot
in the lungs), he diagnosed it before anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   His concern for patients was evident last week as he talked to
24-year-old Sharon Jones as she cradled her very premature baby,
James Michael, on her chest in the Turner Neonatal Intensive Care
Unit at Hermann Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   While medicine has yet to take advantage of many potential
benefits of nitric oxide, it is already helping save the lives of
very premature newborns in neonatal units across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the infants in the Turner Unit will benefit from nitric
oxide used in small doses to open up their constricted pulmonary
arteries and allow their blood to be more fully oxygenated.
</P>
<P>
   Little Michael, born weighing 1 pound, 7.6 ounces, has not yet
had to have nitric oxide. But his mother and father drive in
regularly from Splendora to cuddle the infant born three months
early at a hospital in Humble.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Murad's big body, hugged by the yellow cotton gown
required in such nurseries, dwarfed the young mother as she cradled
her infant.
</P>
<P>
   But he leaned forward to catch her soft words, and he was
cautiously encouraging as he elicited the story about how Sharon
Jones had dropped out of college when her baby was born, and now
spent hours each day holding him close. His father takes the
weekend duty, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got married when I was 19,'' she said. ``We wanted to wait
a few years to have children, but ...''
</P>
<P>
   Even though a medical school planning committee was awaiting
Murad's appearance downstairs, he seemed in no hurry as he talked
to Jones and toured the unit with Dr. John Sparks, chairman of UT's
Pediatrics Department.
</P>
<P>
   Murad's enthusiasm for the treatment options offered by nitric
oxide is almost boundless, but his face and voice soften when he
talks about the use in keeping newborns healthy and whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been a real shot in the arm for the school,'' said
Sparks. Already, Murad has been working with pediatric researchers
like Dr. Michael Fant and Dr. Bruce Alpert, whose interests in
infant development and care of critically ill children overlaps
that of Murad.
</P>
<P>
   His interest is not limited to children, but as the father of
five, he has been necessarily involved with the younger generation.
</P>
<P>
   All his youngsters are grown and gone, but Monday morning's
first hours were spent tracking them down and telling them about
his Nobel.
</P>
<P>
   Another of those early communications was with Delismon, a
retired Boeing senior principal engineer who now lives in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so excited when I heard in on television,'' said
Delismon. ``I didn't even stay upstairs to hear the whole thing. I
ran downstairs and e-mailed him my congratulations.''
</P>
<P>
   The two grew up in Whiting, Ind., a town of 10,000 south of
Chicago. Their high school had only about 120 students in the
senior class.
</P>
<P>
   But the teachers were wonderful, said Delismon. ``They really
took an interest in us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Delismon, who describes his youthful self as 6 feet tall and 125
pounds, managed the swimming and football teams. Murad, he said,
lettered in track and football. Both were members of the men's glee
club and took roles in school and local operettas and musical
productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always smooth,'' said Delismon. ``He was voted best
dressed in high school. The dress then was slacks and sweaters.''
</P>
<P>
   At lunch, the pair would eat at a small restaurant run by
Murad's parents, John and Josephine, Delismon said. It was a
favorite with teachers and students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just a bunch of gunky kids 16 and 17 years old,'' he
said. ``But they went out of their way to take an interest in us.
It was absolutely amazing.''

</P>
<P>
   Murad's father had emigrated from Albania when he was only 16.
His wife was from St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they were living today, they would be so proud,'' said
Delismon.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Murad nor Delismon were valedictorian or salutatorian,
but ``we were up there,'' said Delismon. They competed mercilessly.
If one got a 95 on a test, the other got a 100. After graduation,
many of the students took a college algebra course from Indiana
University, Delismon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was another competition,'' he said. ``Did you get a hundred
on the exam? What? Only a 99? You dummy!
</P>
<P>
   ``We aced that class, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought his friend would win the Nobel Prize,
Delismon said, ``Never.''
</P>
<P>
   When Murad first made his nitric oxide discovery almost 20 years
ago, he told Delismon that it was important and might lead to some
kinds of awards. His friend remembers what he told Murad later.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were the only one who thought this work was important,''
said Delismon. ``You never give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Murad's interest in nitric oxide began early in his career, and
he continued to work in the field even when others thought his
pursuit fruitless because nitric oxide acted contrary to what was
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Because it has one electron free, nitric oxide is known as a
free radical. It readily combines with other chemicals in the body,
and exists in a pure state no longer than 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But those crucial 10 seconds allow the gas produced by one cell
to penetrate the outer membrane and regulate the function of
another cell. It was the first time that a gas had been found to
act as a ``signaling'' molecule that turns on the functions of
other cells.
</P>
<P>
   Further work in the field showed that this so-called
second-message molecule provides crucial signals in the
cardiovascular and nervous systems. It fights infections, regulates
blood pressure and governs the flow of blood to different organs.
</P>
<P>
   Delismon understands the basics of his friend's work, but Murad
laughs when asked about Delismon's.
</P>
<P>
   Most of it was top-secret for the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd say, `I would tell you about it, but then I'd have to
kill you,' '' Murad said.
</P>
<P>
   Delismon said he knows what Murad will say when they meet next:
``I'm ahead, one Nobel to nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The two parted ways when they went to college. Murad went to
DePauw, Delismon to the University of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   After getting his bachelor's degree, Murad was almost ready to
go Washington University in St. Louis when a fraternity brother
told him about an M.D.-Ph.D. program at Case Western. He obtained
both his medical degree and a doctorate in pharmacology there.
</P>
<P>
   At the prestigious Massachusetts General Hospital, where he did
his internship and residency with Willerson, he also worked with
future Nobel laureate Dr. Joseph Goldstein of UT Southwestern
Medical School in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very bright and hard working,'' said Willerson. ``He is
committed to doing everything well. He wants everything around him
to be done at a high level. He is ambitious for the Health Science
Center and the Texas Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the same time, he is unassuming and shy.''
</P>
<P>
   And he is a regular guy, said wife Carol. Most people call him
``Fred'' rather than Ferid, an Albanian name his father gave him.
</P>
<P>
   ``And how many doctors do you know who have a radial saw in the
garage?'' asked his wife.
</P>
<P>
   He always has some kind building project, she said. He built a
garage at their Lake Tahoe home, she said, and a three-car garage
at their former place in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   He taught his son to build and fix the family cars. ``And,'' she
said, ``my oldest daughter can do a mean wallboard.''
</P>
<P>
   None of Murad's four daughters nor his son went into medicine,
although one is a medical editor and another a respiratory
therapist. ``I guess I scared them off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like many in the medical field, he has bounced from medical
school to medical school and even done a stint in the
pharmaceutical industry.
</P>
<P>
   He was at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville and at
Stanford University in California. In the early 1990s, he was vice
president for pharmaceutical research and development for Abbott
Laboratories in Illinois. ``Then I decided to create a biotech
company at the wrong time,'' he said. ``I spent most of my time
raising money.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not what he liked to do, and he left Molecular Geriatrics
Corp. in Lake Bluff, Ill., to return to academia where he could do
what he likes best _ research and teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really get my jollies when I go to the blackboard with my
trainees,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There they plan new experiments and mull over old ones. They
brainstorm new work that could take a couple of months or a couple
of years.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, his trainees are a new generation of Ferid Murad, just
as he is a product of the laboratories in which he was trained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look on my trainees as scientific offspring,'' he said. ``I
follow what they are doing, and many have done well. They are
scattered around the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very likely that he will grow his own Nobel Prize
winners here,'' said Dr. M. David Low, president of the UT Health
Science Center. ``It is one of our challenges to make sure that all
the conditions are there so he can.'' &QL;

   SHADRACH
</P>
<P>
   Written by: Susanna Styron and Bridget Terry (based on the short
story by William Styron)
</P>
<P>
   Directed by: Susanna Styron
</P>
<P>
   Starring: Harvey Keitel, Andie MacDowell, John Franklin Sawyer,
Scott Terra, Daniel Treat
</P>
<P>
   Running time: 88 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Rated: PG-13 (profanity, racial epithets)
</P>
<P>
   Paul Whitehurst (Scott Terra) is a proper white child from a
proper white family in small-town Virginia. Doesn't have any
brothers and sisters, and while he seems a mite lonely at times,
his parents try to do right by him. He's clean, well fed, polite,
fears the Lord. This being the South, and this being 1935, Paul
doesn't have too many dealings with black folks. There's the
family's housekeeper, and he also sees them in the colored-only
balcony at the local movie house where he goes to see Stepin
Fetchit movies, but all that changes when he meets Shadrach (John
Franklin Sawyer).
</P>
<P>
   That's the old man Paul spies while playing marbles with his
best friend, Little Mole (Daniel Treat), the youngest of the Dabney
clan's seven children. The Dabneys, well, there's nothing else to
call them but white trash. The house is a wreck, and the front lawn
is littered with old appliances and rusted bed frames. The boys
don't bathe, and walk around with body odor so strong it could take
your sight. The girls get pregnant, and just seem to stay pregnant.
The mother of this brood, Trixie (Andie MacDowell), is a good
woman, if a little too fond of beer _ she goes to sleep with bottle
in hand, and greets the new day with a cold one in her grasp. Her
husband, Vernon (Harvey Keitel), is holding his family together,
but barely. He blames FDR _ ``Franklin D-as-in-disaster
Roosevelt,'' as he is fond of saying _ for the Depression. But
truth be told, the family has been on the skids since the
Confederacy fell and its tobacco plantation went belly up. The
Dabneys' sole source of income comes from Vernon's on-the-sly corn
liquor still.
</P>
<P>
   But back to Shadrach. He shows up one day at the Dabney home,
and takes an instant liking to Paul, who's staying with the clan
while his parents attend a funeral in Maryland. Shadrach reveals
he's 99 years old, and has walked all the way from Alabama to die
on Dabney land. He was born a slave on the Dabney plantation, and
was sold away from his family when he was barely a man. Now, at the
end of his life, he's come home to die. It's the final wish of a
man who has borne too long life's burdens, but there's a problem.
The sheriff says it's against the law for Vernon to plant Shadrach
in Dabney ground. And Vernon doesn't have the $35 for a ``proper
legal Negro burial'' with a colored undertaker in a colored
cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take long to figure out that Paul is going to learn
all kinds of eternal lessons from the old man, things about life
and death, the resilience of the spirit, and reclaiming yourself.
``Shadrach,'' based on a William Styron short story and adapted
here by his daughter Susanna, is a slight film that never reaches
beyond the surface. It's all pleasant and inoffensive enough, but
it should be so much more than a leisurely stroll through the
Depression-era South.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is Shadrach himself, played by newcomer
Sawyer, an 83-year-old retired postal worker. Make no mistake, with
his snow-white hair and face like aged ebony, Sawyer is a magnetic
presence. As the illiterate, incontinent Shadrach, Sawyer does
everything asked of him; unfortunately, it isn't much. He
occasionally utters ``Praise the Lord, praise his sweet name,'' but
that's it. He has precious little dialogue, so the audience must
rely on Paul's imagination to flesh out Shadrach's life and
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   This could have worked, but the film needs a more charismatic
youngster to portray Paul. Terra's a cute kid, but that's all. He's
the eyes and ears of the audience (his adult narration is supplied
by Martin Sheen), yet he doesn't register as enough of a presence
even when he wonders whether heaven has colored-only designations
on its water fouuntains and outhouses.
</P>
<P>
   It may say something about the film that the strongest
performance is delivered by McDowell, who has never been a
scintillating actress. She is far more convincing than she has any
right to be as a sassy, hard-drinking Southern gal, tossing off
lines like ``Boy, it's hot enough to kill a mule out here.''
Wrestling with his own dewdrop accent, Keitel's in overdrive mode,
playing much too big and blustery for the rather sedate proceedings
around him.
</P>
<P>
   Styron is an able, if unspectacular, director, but she's too
precious in her handing of the story. ``Shadrach'' should have the
power and majesty of make-you-wanna-shout gospel, but it never
raises its voice above a whisper.

TWO GENERATIONS OF BLUESMEN AVOIT THE FAD OF THE MINUTE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We're not talking flavor-of-the-month artists here. We're
talking about two generations of bluesmen _ John Lee Hooker and
Billy Squier _ who function outside of passing trends and like it
that way.
</P>
<P>
   Hooker, the 81-year-old dean of blues boogie, and Squier, a
48-year-old Wellesley native who learned the blues through Eric
Clapton's albums, have no overripe ambitions at this point, other
than to make the best music they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no big plans. Things just happen,'' says Hooker, whose
new album ``The Best of Friends'' is out Tuesday and features
collaborations with Clapton, Ben Harper, Ry Cooder, and Charlie
Musselwhite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hanging in there,'' Hooker adds from his San Francisco
home. ``I'm hanging on like a vine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a very uncalculated project,'' Squier says of
his own just released ``Acoustic Blues.'' ``This is not a career
record. When I made it, as far as I was concerned, my career was
over because I was fed up with the (record industry). I just
started exploring the guitar and seeing where it would take me.''
</P>
<P>
   Both records are small gems in the vast sea of fall releases.
Hooker's disc is really a ``best of'' duets record, collecting past
duets with buddies Van Morrison, Carlos Santana, and Bonnie Raitt,
along with three new tracks that should sustain interest in his
ever-influential career.
</P>
<P>
   The new songs include a fiery remake of Hooker's hit, ``Boogie
Chillen,'' with new riffs from Clapton. ``It's cooking, isn't it?''
says Hooker. ``It's a different version with a different beat and
more drive. And Clapton is the all-around man. I first played with
him a long time ago. He was with John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers
and they backed me on a tour of England in the '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   Hooker, who grew up in a sharecropping family just outside
Clarksdale, Miss., also teamed with slide guitarist Cooder for a
new romp through the shuffling ``Big Legs, Tight Skirt.'' The title
suggests that Hooker's blues may not always be politically correct,
but no one is going to question his authenticity. And the other
newly minted track is ``Burnin' Hell,'' a chooglin' number that
shows Hooker's religious side. ``I'm going to the church hall to
get down on my bended knee,'' he sings in his unmistakably gritty
voice.
</P>
<P>
   This track features new friend Ben Harper on slide (``He plays a
mixed blues and puts a real flavor to it,'' says Hooker) and old
friend Charlie Musselwhite on harmonica. ``I've known Charlie a
long time. He lived with me when he broke up with his wife,''
Hooker adds.
</P>
<P>
   As for Squier, the former Wellesley hellion (he can still recall
knotty moments with the local police) has left behind a rock 'n'
roll career that peaked in the '80s with such hits as ``The
Stroke'' and ``My Kinda Lover.'' He became disenchanted with the
music business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm cynical about it,'' says Squier, who lives in New York.
``It's now music in small letters and business in big letters.''
</P>
<P>
   Squier did well enough in his early years (three multi-platinum
albums) that he can now take a more casual approach. Hence
``Acoustic Blues,'' in which he plays solo acoustic guitar and
sings mature songs. He updates ``The Stroke'' in ``Stroke Me
Blues,'' takes a survivor's stance in ``Long Way to Fall,'' and
even remakes Joni Mitchell's ``The River.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I put my guitar in new tunings and took off to see where I
would get,'' says Squier. ``I was just writing songs. I wasn't even
thinking of recording them.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; uftagline &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Squier performs Monday night at 7 at Borders Books &AMP; Music,
Chestnut Hill. Call 617-630-1134.

LOUISIANA SENATOR FINDS SUCCESS IN THE MIDDLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Louisiana Senator John Breaux has seen one
Democratic colleague after another swept away by the Republican
sentiment that was washed over the South in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the Nov. 3 elections, he has this recipe for
survival:
</P>
<P>
   ``Get to the mainstream, moderate, middle of the road,'' said
Breaux, speaking in a slight Cajun accent native to his home
parish. ``And pledge to make government work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the fundamentals of the party, the goals of equal
opportunity and taking care of people who need help,'' said Breaux,
who is comfortably ahead in his reelection race. ``But if we have
problems with something like Medicare, and we need to change it to
save it, we've got to do it. We can't say we can never change.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern Democrats clearly can use some sort of change. The
party in recent years has made some moves toward the middle,
following the lead of the Democratic Leadership Council that Breaux
and his old friend Bill Clinton helped establish. ``Clinton took
our DLC mandate _ responsibility, opportunity, community _ and
carried Louisiana twice,'' Breaux said.
</P>
<P>
   But since Clinton's election in 1992, Democrats have lost eight
US Senate seats in the South, seeing their 15-7 advantage reversed
in six years.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades ago, Democrats held virtually every Senate seat in
the old Confederacy, giving the party a solid majority and
extending great power to such senior figures as Richard Russell and
Herman Talmadge in Georgia, John Stennis and James Eastland in
Mississippi, John Sparkman in Alabama, and Russell Long in
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic hegemony was first broken by the election of
Republicans in Texas and Tennessee and the defection of Senator
Strom Thurmond to the GOP in South Carolina. Then the
transformation gathered force.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans began to make big gains with the electorate in
the 1980s under Ronald Reagan,'' said Merle Black, a professor of
politics at Emory University. Though many states have no formal
party registration, Black said, exit polls in 1996 determined that
most white voters in the South call themselves Republicans and
identify with the party's conservative positions.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans had ``better candidates and aggressive campaigns
that appealed to the white swing voters,'' said Black, who
specializes in Southern politics.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic setbacks across Dixie during this decade are
directly related to the party's loss of power on Capitol Hill, and
there seems little chance that the Democrats will gain a Senate
seat in the region this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux, however, has been building seniority while other
Southern Democrats have been losing theirs. A fixture in Washington
since he was first elected to Congress in 1972 at age 28, Breaux
would become the region's senior Democrat if Senator Ernest
Hollings of South Carolina fails to win reelection next month.
</P>
<P>
   Though a steadfast Democrat, Breaux cannot be defined by
rankings that label legislators liberal or conservative. In the
last Congress, the National Journal rated him near 50 percent on
both liberal and conservative scales on economic and social issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an extremely sophisticated politician. He manages to go
down the middle,'' said Ed Renwick, director of the Institute of
Politics at Loyola University here. ``Breaux wheels and deals with
business, labor, all the power centers. He's very inclusive, and
that's difficult to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaux is so far ahead of his Republican opponent, state
Representative Jim Donelon, that no one has bothered to take a poll
since March, when Breaux was more than 40 points in front of any
rival.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux says Clinton's problems ``could make a difference'' in a
few contests, but not in Louisiana, where the Democratic Party has
remained strong because of a solid base of blacks and a
French-Catholic influence that makes moderate politics more
palatable than the harder-edged conservatism of the Protestant
right.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the South, there are only two closely contested
Senate races. Hollings holds a slight lead over his Republican
challenger, US Representative Bob Inglis, in the latest polls from
South Carolina. In North Carolina, Senator Lauch Faircloth, a
one-term Republican incumbent, is in a tough fight with John
Edwards, a trial lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Incumbents are expected to waltz to reelection in the other
Southern races. Senator Richard Shelby, who renounced the
Democratic Party and joined the GOP after Republicans gained
control of the Senate in 1994, is expected to win easily in
Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Senator Bob Graham is an overwhelming favorite to win
in Florida. In Georgia, Republican Senator Paul Coverdell is
comfortably in front of the Democratic candidate, Michael Coles.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat is expected to hold the seat in Arkansas being
vacated by Senator Dale Bumpers. Blanche Lambert Lincoln, a popular
former congresswoman who gave up her seat two years ago to give
birth to twins, is running 16 points ahead of Republican state
Senator Fay Boozman in the latest poll.

SKA BAND BOSSTONES APPEAR TO BE GOING SOMEWHERE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Let's go back to 1979. Dicky Barrett, growing
up in a western suburb of Boston and in junior high school, has the
Clash's second album, ``Give 'em Enough Rope,'' spinning on his
turntable. The speakers are blasting Joe Strummer's harsh,
righteous vocals. Strummer is singing ``The Last Gang in Town,'' a
defiant, punk-rock-as-group-bonding anthem. Barrett may live an
ocean away from London, but Strummer's speaking to him.
</P>
<P>
   Skip ahead ...
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday at 4 p.m., coinciding with the release of the first
live Bosstones CD, Strummer will be in Boston at Tower Records to
present a ``Walk of Fame'' star to Barrett and the Boston ska-punk
band he fronts, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones.
</P>
<P>
   There is an element of this that is mind-boggling to Barrett.
Could he ever have imagined?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not in a million years,'' says Barrett. ``If I were to go to
one of his concerts _ and I never did _ and was in the third row
and he spat on me, that'd have been exciting!''
</P>
<P>
   A pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe, next week,'' says bassist Joe Gittleman, helpfully and
hopefully.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufdots &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Barrett and Gittleman _ the two main voices of the seven-member
Bosstones _ are seated at a table set up on the otherwise barren
floor at the Middle East Downstairs, early evening, last Monday.
Rock 'n' roll will happen soon in this club _ and come early
December the Bosstones will host four 18-plus nights of their fifth
annual, sweat-drenched Hometown Throwdown in this very spot (a
fifth show, all ages, will take place at the nearby Greek-American
Club on Green Street) _ but right now Barrett and Gittleman are
discussing the good life, as the warm afterglow of success lingers.
</P>
<P>
   Well, sort of. Certainly, they have no complaints. They've
toured the world and gained friends and fans far and wide. Money
has been made. But the good life is not one of limousines and
country estates. It's more, both say, the simple fact that everyone
actually has their own place to live and no longer has to crash
with Gittleman's mother in Cambridge's Central Square.
</P>
<P>
   The Mighty Mighty Bosstones' 1997 album, ``Let's Face It,''
featuring the hit single, ``The Impression That I Get,'' sold over
a million copies in the United States, over 2 million worldwide.
The Bosstones had been on an upward trajectory for some time, but
this put them in the upper stratum of the alt-rock world and on, or
near, the top of the ska-punk re-revival they almost
single-handedly kick-started back in the early 1980s. It was at
this long-ago point, remember, that the English two-tone ska
revival was on the wane, and a betting person would have said the
plaid-clad Bosstones were waging a futile battle. Ska was passe.
Next trend?
</P>
<P>
   Barrett laughs. ``Oh, yeah, it was over,'' he says. ``Ninety
percent (of our genre) was over. The way people thought the story
was gonna go was these eight guys, whacking away, trying as hard as
they can, doing all the right things, showing up and entertaining
every single time ... and they'd quietly go away and it would be
the best-kept secret. But no. It didn't end up like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Just about any punk-rooted band gets hit with a critical
backlash if success comes a-knocking. Ask the guys in Green Day.
For the Bosstones, there was virtually no backlash. Everybody liked
the Bosstones. Everyone still likes the Bosstones. Even, says
Barrett, Gavin Rossdale. And that was after Barrett got drunk and
dissed Rossdale, the singer from Bush, for being in a derivative
weenie band. A year or so later Rossdale came back and told Barrett
how much he liked the Mighty Mighty Bosstones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bosstones got what they finally deserved,'' says Barrett.
``I think it's because we work hard, we're nice, and we did make
friends along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Gittleman: ``It was like, after all this time, they deserve
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But success is not about flaunting rock-star status. If a fan
gets the wrong idea and approaches Barrett that way, he says, with
a laugh, that he'll make them run away crying, with Barrett yelling
at them, ``I'm not a rock star!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look out my own eyeballs,'' he says, ``I don't think
I'm looking out of a rock star's eyes. I think I'm looking out of
this awkward, creepy Dicky Barrett guy's eyes. ... If someone
treats me differently because of what the band's done, I just stomp
on that immediately and say, `Slow down.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a kid. I've met people (in this role) for a long time
and treat them the best I can. I've always thought that society's
not taking kids seriously and I do and always have.''
</P>
<P>
   What Barrett and the Bosstones are about is creating and
maintaining a sense of community. Is that community solid? Has it
grown? Do the Bosstones still feel the connection deeply?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, yes, and yes,'' answers Barrett. ``Absolutely. And it's
on a national level. We bring people in, guys like Rancid and the
right people in from their coast. And that's extremely important to
us. It's not fun to do it alone. ... We're blessed people, and we
mean that whether the band did well or not. We've got our arms, our
legs, our brains, our friendships, and we live in a time in history
when there's not an amazing amount of pressure on guys our age to
truly do anything like fight wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Gittleman notes that the 30-something Bosstones have likely
advanced past fighting age, anyway. In fact, the Bosstones' dancer,
Ben Carr, even got married recently, the first 'tone to take the
plunge. ``We elected him,'' says Gittleman. ``Somebody had to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It took the heat off a lot of us,'' says Barrett. ``At least
one of us did.''
</P>
<P>
   But one of the keys to the band has been its boys-club (ladies
invited) camaraderie. (Saxophonist Kevin Lenear, who played on the
live album, has left the band, only the group's second personnel
change in its history.) &UR;  &LR; Gittleman and Barrett say that remains as
strong as ever. Perhaps the change, says Barrett, is that even if
they're not together 24-7, ``it just goes without saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Bosstones release the 21-track ``Live From the
Middle East'' CD, a disc culled from last year's five shows. Live
albums are not the de rigueur career move they used to be. This is
a good thing. Most live recordings fell way below expectations. For
every Rolling Stones ``Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out'' or the Who's ``Live at
Leeds,'' there were a lot of big, flaccid dust-gatherers chucked
out. The Bosstones, however, are one band for whom the live CD
scenario fits the band and its fans. For one thing, the cliche of
``You've got to see them live'' fits and for another, the
translation from sight-and-sound to just sound, somehow, works.
``Live From the Middle East'' feels like flesh and blood rock 'n'
roll, not like an artifact.
</P>
<P>
   One model for the Sean Slade and Paul Kolderie-produced ``Middle
East'' was the first live J. Geils Band album, ``Full House.''
``Most are stale and stiff,'' says Barrett, of the live album
oeuvre. ``They try to fix them too much and take away what was
cool.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bosstones album gets to a higher plane. Part of the reason,
Barrett says, is that the band recorded the shows without planning
to make an album. That notion came after they heard what they'd
captured. (Barrett says if he knew he was chattering on stage for
posterity he'd have aped every live album line he could recall.)
The jumpy rhythms, punchy horns and, especially, the electric
guitar from Nate Albert kick in.
</P>
<P>
   This, says Barrett and Gittleman, is a what you saw is what you
get outing. Gittleman waded through six hours of tapes with Barrett
and the album's producers and patched the work together from all
the shows. ``We were genuinely overexcited,'' says Barrett, of the
shows. ``A huge adrenaline rush, the culmination of the entire
year. It's an exciting night every single night. The people that
are in the room are just as much a part of the show. We spend the
whole night standing among them, hanging among them, partying with
them and I think (as a recording) this is as close as we can
come.''
</P>
<P>
   This is, in the classic live album sense, a stopgap, a reminder
``that we're not dead,'' says Barrett. The band begins work shortly
on its next studio album. One thing they predict is that Albert's
guitar will be featured more prominently _ one strength they took
away from hearing themselves recorded live.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go out and make the sophomore album,'' says
Gittleman, mock philosophically. ``Wait a minute. It's not our
first album, is it now?'' They both laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the beauty of the band,'' says Barrett. ``Even though
it was our most successful album, it's not our first album. We know
how to be the Bosstones; we know how to make Bosstones albums.''

SUPERSHOT CAMERA BRINGS UP CLOSE   AND PERSONAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Say this for Fox. The network is willing to stretch the limits
of new and existing technology to bring viewers closer to the game
of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The latest innovation for the World Series is the Supershot
camera. It's really a slow-motion camera, but instead of focusing
it on a specific player, Fox plans to have it trained on the ball
to capture all the plays, up close and personal.
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect world, the Supershot would not only show a ball
being hit to the shortstop, for example, but also provide a tighter
shot showing the ball entering his glove and being transferred to
his right hand as he throws to first.
</P>
<P>
   The camera, one of 19 Fox plans to use during its coverage of
the World Series starting tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. when the Padres
visit the Yankees, will be stationed along the third base line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to do tight shots when appropriate,'' said producer
John Filippelli. ``They are what we enjoy in the coverage because
they portray the drama and capture the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Filippelli said, Fox trained its slo-mo camera on
the pitcher. But the Supershot ideally will allow viewers to
determine, for instance, whether a baserunner is safe. Not that the
shot will change an umpire's call.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is still working out agreements with the players involved to
wear the catcher-cam, one of best innovations on television. The
shots from the tiny camera perched on the catcher's mask are
priceless.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Buck, Tim McCarver, and Bob Brenly are calling the Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people assume on paper that this will be a very short
World Series,'' Brenly said. ``But the Padres are a very underrated
team. Their grit was shown during the team's series against the
Houston Astros and Atlanta Braves. They were heavy underdogs in
both of those series but managed to win them. They don't scare
easily. They don't back up. In fact, they move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarver said the Series could be ``a great ending to the best
season baseball we ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
That's his audience
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Andelman just bit the hand that feeds him. He blasted his
talk show callers who don't like Bill Parcells, describing them in
a New York tabloid as ``unsophisticated,'' ``brainwashed,'' and a
``herd of ignoramuses.''
</P>
<P>
   The WEEI talk show host's tirade appeared Wednesday in the New
York Post. Surprisingly, Andelman blamed sports talk radio for
spreading the hatred toward Parcells, the coach who left the
Patriots for the Jets last season. He also claimed he was a
Parcells supporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came, he was paid, he did his job and left,'' Andelman
said. ``Why would I wish any ill will on him?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the people who are buying the $5 beers, betting on the
games, the rowdy guys who don't have enough sophistication to
understand what free agency is,'' he added. ``If Parcells says or
does anything, in order to make him look bad, they'll entrap him
into something to fit their own conditions. Patriots owner Bob
Kraft is very skilled at mass brainwashing. Now he's been the best
owner the Patriots have had, but he has this whoop-it-up mentality
to gather the masses against Parcells. The same thing in this town
that applies to Bill Parcells now applies to Roger Clemens.''
</P>
<P>
   Andelman went on to say that only three things matter in Boston
_ sports, politics, and revenge. ``Love is an emotion and so is
hate,'' he said. ``It's `if our team can't win, let's root against
the Jets.' It's like in baseball: `If the Red Sox can't win, let's
root against the Yankees.'''

FOREIGN DESIGNERS' CASUAL APPROACHES BUBBLE OVER INTO FRENCH
FASHION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The lighter, more casual approach to women's fashion,
taken in Milan's spring 1999 ready-to-wear collections, is bubbling
over into French fashion, albeit under the hand of foreign
designers.
</P>
<P>
   The first three significant shows of the season were designed by
an Englishman, an American and a Belgian, at Christian Dior, Louis
Vuitton and Hermes, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Galliano for Dior &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Galliano lifted spirits, if not ideologies, in his Dior
presentation in the firm's Avenue Montaigne fitting rooms, reached
after a climb up a dramatic stone staircase. Models marched into
rooms and cubicles, posing in the ``Lost Boys' Room,'' for example,
against a decadent bed of mussed sheets, lacy pillows and cashmere
throws. Fluffy white feathers littered the bed and floor, as if the
boys had just enjoyed a naughty pillow fight.
</P>
<P>
   Galliano's collection, inspired by the Russian Constructivist
movement, was replete with olive green uniform jackets with Red
Army trim, sleeves rolled into epaulettes and most worn over stiff
A-line or sheer crystal-pleated skirts. The pants, perhaps a bit
difficult to wear by any but the tallest women, are gargantuan
pleated affairs gathered with drawstrings at the ankles.
Fortuny-pleated tunics and skirts were fastened Chinese style with
bronze ribbon frogs.
</P>
<P>
   Brassy CD initials and stars marked the high jacket collars, and
slightly faded red Guardian Angel berets set off each outfit, as
the curvy waists and stiff skirts recalled the original Dior's
post-World War II New Look. For those who bemoaned the absence of
good jackets in Milan, Galliano delivered and delivered.
</P>
<P>
   The Dior collection also includes a group of white suits, black
lacquered Aran knits and the simplest ivory dresses, the latter
charmingly displayed on three barefoot models with long blond
tresses in the best Daryl-Hannah-as-mermaid style.
</P>
<P>
   Galliano's tour de force in this collection was not that of
camaraderie, however, but the sensuous and breathtaking evening
gowns of silk charmeuse. With fabric worked on the bias and in
chevrons, dresses began as narrow slips and swept the floor in
voluminous trumpet skirts. They came in white, black or
combinations of blood red, white and black. The same colors also
appeared in graphic designs on stiff organdy coats, tunics and
dresses, graphics in the style of artist Sonia Delaunay.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marc Jacobs for Louis Vuitton &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That the roots of French fashion still flourish after some long
years of minimalism is very much because of single-minded designers
such as Galliano. While U.S. designer Marc Jacobs was much improved
in his second collection for Louis Vuitton, his is a totally
different path than that of Galliano.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs' show, in the far 15th ``arrondissement,'' was held in a
glass greenhouse, with the weather cooperating to showcase a blue
sky, fluffy clouds and a green park and fountain setting outdoors.
But just in case, the Vuitton collection was chock-full of
rainproof ponchos. Worn with shorts, they would be perfect for
rainy-day bicycle rides. In sheer fabrics over shiny
paillette-covered tops, they could go out for evening.
</P>
<P>
   A rubberized raincoat sported a stylized design of rain
splatters against a background of white, tan and black graphic
shapes. The tan seen throughout the collection was a play on
Vuitton's traditional tan leather, which Jacobs used to best
advantage in accessories with a clear vinyl embossed with the
familiar LV, diamond and rosette designs.
</P>
<P>
   If a one-world description is needed of the Jacobs designs, it
would be minimalist, but the fabrics are luxurious as well as
modern. The colors _ white, beige, blue, yellow, lilac and a mossy
green _ expanded beyond the black and gray of recent years. And
Jacobs' wit was showcased in velvet and plastic bikinis, pastel
bags and pouches on belts and even a pale yellow motorbike helmet.
</P>
<P>
   The grand tour image that Louis Vuitton has always epitomized is
changing under Jacobs, and perhaps for the better, to one that is
younger and sportier, although still firmly tied to luxury goods.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Margiela for Hermes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hermes, another French leather-goods house that has
traditionally prided itself on furnishings for ladies and gentlemen
traveling or relaxing at home or around their private stables, is
undergoing a change of image. There, designer Margiela, also in his
second season and true to his word, sent out not a totally new
collection but one built on the new classics he established for
this fall and winter.
</P>
<P>
   His ``pea jacket,'' actually a long-sleeved tunic with a deep V
neckline, was translated for spring in fabrics from dusky brown
crepe to beige lambskin. If that appears not a wide range of color,
that was Margiela's intention, branching out only from brown tones
into white, gray, putty and sepia.
</P>
<P>
   The fabrics were much lighter-weight than for fall, with ribbon
knits, cotton jersey and gabardine, wool and twill crepes and linen
in several weaves. Dresses, unadorned and hanging roomily but
straight from the shoulder, were the coolest alternatives, along
with cotton ``pea shirts,'' sporting no buttons but rather the deep
V neckline.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Margiela showed the collection on mature models, who
not only made eye contact with the audience in Faubourg
Saint-Honore showroom but also smiled. While not as young or as
sporty as Jacobs' designs for Vuitton, these looks are a giant leap
forward for Hermes and probably much more in keeping with the
company's customer image.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ennio Capasa for Costume National &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Costume National, shown in the heart of the lovely old Ecole
des Beaux Arts on the Left Bank, the hits were little leather
jackets and flat-front pants. Designer Ennio Capasa chose
tight-fitting designs that might have added a touch of modernity
along with rubberized shirt jackets, but then he flubbed up with
too many gimmicks such as capelets, slits and finally trains that
dragged the runways behind pants. Why?
</P>
<P>
   As in Milan, these French collections are beginning to diverge
in two directions _ that of the modernists, who take their lead
from high-tech fabrics, and the path of luxury, also dependent on
materials but more often natural, more costly ones. &QL;

STRONG CONNECTION BETWEEN GOAL SETTING, ACCOMPLISHING GOALS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lots of us agonize over what kind of floor covering we'd like in
our kitchen or what kind of paint color would look good in our
living room.
</P>
<P>
   We may spend hours going from one tile store to another
comparing nearly identical blocks of stone or examining paint
samples under a variety of lighting conditions yet we seldom spend
as much time planning our own careers.
</P>
<P>
   We're so busy tending to our daily responsibilities or juggling
family responsibilities or crossing off the ``to do'' things on our
daily list that we never sit back and decide where we really want
to go.
</P>
<P>
   It's a matter of being the author of your own life, said
Nicholas Lore, the author of ``The Pathfinder: How to Choose or
Change Your Career for a Lifetime of Satisfaction and Success''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster). Most people are so caught up in living their
lives that they don't think of sitting down and deciding what they
want to do in life.
</P>
<P>
   Lore believes there is a strong connection between goal setting
and accomplishing the goals.
</P>
<P>
   People who write their goals down and revisit them often _ about
every three months _ tend to fulfill their goals, said Lore, who is
director of the Rockport Institute, a career planning consulting
firm in Rockville, Md. Conversely, people who don't write them down
and have no formal structure to complete their goals tend not to
fulfill them.
</P>
<P>
   Goals give us something to shoot for, said Rory Aplanalp,
president of StarQuest, a consulting firm in Houston that teaches
goal setting. If you don't know where you're going, how will you
know when you get there?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary vs. extraordinary &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Setting goals is adventurous, Lore said. It means the difference
between an ordinary life and an extraordinary one.
</P>
<P>
   Lore said he has a friend who sat down at the age of 15 and made
a list of 127 things he wanted to do in his life. Some of the goals
sound crazy like retracing the travels of Marco Polo and Alexander
the Great or farfetched like watching a cremation ceremony in Bali
or nearly impossible like building his own telescope.
</P>
<P>
   But by carefully planning a way to accomplish his goals, Lore
said his friend has completed most of them, including the ones
listed above. (However, he still hasn't read the entire
Encyclopedia Britannica or appeared in a Tarzan movie.)
</P>
<P>
   While goal setting is kind of a no-brainer, why do so many
people not do it?
</P>
<P>
   Lore said it's because humans feel comfortable at equilibrium.
We like things to stay on a even keel and when things get thrown
off, we struggle to get back to that comfort zone.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to get off your duff is to realize you're in
equilibrium and that you're unwilling to stay there, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes that's caused by a crisis. Other times, circumstances
build up over time at work and reach a point when you don't want to
put up with things any more, he said.
</P>
<P>
   People either go toward pleasure or away from discomfort, he
said. Either way, there has to be a commitment to become the master
of your life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're perfectly happy to sit with your feet up with a
brewski and open a bag of chips, then you're never going to
change,'' Lore said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Method for creating goals &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aplanalp has a five-step method for creating goals. The most
important is to set a goal based on what you value, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Aplanalp said he strives to be the best father and
husband he can be so he made a goal of taking his family, including
his eight children, on a Hawaiian vacation. It took six years of
planning and saving but the group went last Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   A goal also must have a deadline: year, month and day, and it
also must be specific, he said. For Aplanalp, that meant deciding
which islands to visit and how long they'd stay in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   It's also important to anticipate obstacles and finally, be
realistic.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Lane believes that writing down her goals has helped her
achieve many of her dreams. She dusts them off annually, about the
same time she celebrates the anniversary of her company,
Association Services Team.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, who had been a human resource executive, used goal setting
to chose a new career. She kept a journal and continually evaluated
what she wanted in life and settled on a career of managing
professional associations.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, setting goals and writing them down keeps Lane
highly focused on her plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave my life control at a time when I didn't feel that I
had any control,'' she said. ``Now I feel as if I have a roadmap.''

 AEROSMITH COMES ROCKING BACK ON LIVE ALBUM
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   &UR; gfcdrop &LR; Aerosmith has evoked both praise and criticism for the
slickness of its recent hit, ``I Don't Miss a Thing,'' a Diane
Warren-penned tune from the ``Armaggedon'' soundtrack that became
the band's first No.1 song. But no such argument should accompany
Aerosmith's new twin-CD live set, ``A Little South of Sanity,''
which rocks as hard as any live record in memory. Forget the
slickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real live record,'' says Aerosmith drummer Joey
Kramer, on the phone from New York. ``It's the band playing live on
stage and there's no going back into the studio and redoing stuff
and making it sound all pretty. It's the band on stage, mistakes
and all. What you hear is what you get.''
</P>
<P>
   And what you hear is excellent, even by Aerosmith's lofty stage
standards. The recordings are taken from various shows from
Boston's FleetCenter to venues across the world during the band's
``Nine Lives'' and ``Get a Grip'' tours of the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The album is really up-to-date,'' says Kramer, who returns
with his mates to the FleetCenter Dec. 31 and the Worcester Centrum
Centre Jan. 2. ``There might be four or five songs from the `Get a
Grip' tour, but the rest of it is all from `Nine Lives.'''
</P>
<P>
   The new live set, which comes out Tuesday, follows the general
song list of Aerosmith's latter-year shows, starting with a
whomping Steven Tyler/Joe Perry-driven ``Eat the Rich.'' Tyler also
launches wild screams on the drug-exorcising ``Monkey on My Back''
and, in another feverish moment, dedicates ``Mama Kin'' to the
Boston club the band owns by that name. ``To the people that go to
Mama Kin and work at Mama Kin and hang at Mama Kin,'' Tyler shouts.
</P>
<P>
   The live set actually represents a contractual obligation to
Aerosmith's former label, Geffen Records. Aerosmith switched to
Sony for the last studio album, ``Nine Lives,'' but as part of the
negotiation to leave Geffen, the band promised Geffen a live set
that would include the first two singles from the Sony deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're going to be a little sorry they let us go,''
Kramer says of Geffen.
</P>
<P>
   The band could have put out a lackluster disc, as many bands do
when they're leaving a label, but Aerosmith made a heightened
return to rock 'n' roll. That was supplied in part by the
reappearance of the band's former producer, Jack Douglas, who mixed
the new record. ``We had a lot of fun with Jack back in the old
days,'' says Kramer. ``And it was a good idea to have him mix the
live stuff, because if there's anybody who knows how the band is
supposed to sound, it's Jack.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Aerosmith seems to be firing on all cylinders these
days. Tyler is back in the saddle after injuring his knee this
summer with a twirling microphone. And Kramer is back after
suffering second-degree burns when his Ferrari caught fire at a
Scituate gas station. Kramer intends to file a lawsuit contending
that the automatic shut-off valve at the pump failed to work,
though he does acknowledge that he failed to turn off the engine
before it shot up in flames and destroyed the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hard way to get the summer off, but it kind of
refreshed everybody,'' says Kramer.
</P>
<P>
   As for the recent hit single, which went from idea to conception
in just 10 days, Aerosmith doesn't mind taking heat for it from
core fans. ``Well, I guess enough people like it if it became a
No.1 song,'' says Kramer. ``And because of the hit single, our
shows have been pretty much sold out.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Kramer's burns: ``They've healed up very well and I've
got no scars,'' he says. As for future plans, he adds that
Aerosmith will start writing another record in the spring, then
maybe release it next fall. ``But we're going to pretty much stay
on the road for a while now,'' he notes. ``We're going to stay out
there and pound the boards a bit.''

She revealed a hypnotic voice that lies somewhere between that of
Sinead O'Connor and Sandy Denny, combined with a lyrical grace that
mixed street realism and spirituality. Her stage show doesn't yet
rival the shimmer of her recent debut album, ``No Mermaid,'' but
it's getting there.

WINDOWS FIND FUNCTION CAN TURN INTO A SHORTCUT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I use the Find feature on Windows 98 quite a bit. But instead
of going through all the various menus _ Start, Find, Files or
Folders _ can one place ``Files or folders'' be a shortcut on the
desktop?
</P>
<P>
   A. Sure. This is a nifty, hidden feature of Windows that gets
little attention, but if you use the Find function a lot it makes
your life easier.
</P>
<P>
   Bring up Find as you indicated, via the Start menu. Then Click
on File, Save Search. This will create an icon on your desktop most
likely called All Files.
</P>
<P>
   If you search for the same thing over and over _ say, files with
a DOC extension _ you can fill in the blanks for that kind of
search, and use the File/Save Search command. You can also tell the
Find feature to look only in specific places _ a set of folders, a
single drive, etc. _ and save those. Create a folder on your
desktop, call it Search and move all these icons in there for quick
access to the things you search most often.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have Norton Antivirus, which automatically updates with
downloads, always at a preset time on Fridays. Recently, I happened
by the computer when the download was taking place. I didn't recall
being logged on to the Net, so I picked up the phone to hear what
was happening. I got a dial tone. Can you explain how Norton logs
on to my machine silently and without interrupting the phone
service? When one reads about hackers breaking into computers, do
they use similar technology to do it?
</P>
<P>
   A. Don't worry. Norton Antivirus wasn't making a stealth
connection _ though it can be set up to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Many programs are now designed to make automatic checks for
updated components, including Windows 98 itself. What you saw in
this case was Norton Antivirus launching its LiveUpdate feature,
but just churning its wheels, looking for an Internet connection.
You get the same screen whether you are online or not, so it can
appear as though you are downloading something even though that's
not the case.
</P>
<P>
   You can control when most of these auto-downloading components
check for updates, or turn off the automated feature, via each
program's settings. Some, however, use Windows 95's System Agent _
called the Task Scheduler in Windows 98 _ to schedule updates.
Check the manual for the product in question to find out how it's
done.
</P>
<P>
   If your computer had been so configured, your Norton Antivirus
could have made the connection, downloaded the component and
disconnected without your intervention.
</P>
<P>
   To do this, set up Norton Antivirus to dial directly into its
server, rather than going over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I recently spilled a Coke in my keyboard, which ruined it. I
had to throw it away and get a new one. Then, a friend told me
there is a way to fix it by using a can of compressed air and
letting it dry. Is this true?
</P>
<P>
   A. If you spill plain water in a keyboard, you might be able to
salvage it by first getting as much water out of it as possible.
Turn it upside down, shake it, then leave it upside down overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, take the back off the keyboard and remove the
plate that holds the keys. Use compressed air to blow as much
moisture as you can out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Wait another day, or dry it with a hair dryer. Then, plug it in
and cross your fingers.
</P>
<P>
   With sugary sodas and coffee, you have the additional problem of
the sticky sweet substance. I'm not familiar with any way to remove
this stuff. If any hardware gurus out there have suggestions,
e-mail them to me.

56K MODEMS RUNNING INTO SPEED LIMITS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the new v.90 standard for 56K modems was approved earlier
this year, both users and manufacturers breathed a sigh of relief.
Burdened for months by competing 56K standards, buyers were
confused and held off upgrading to the faster devices.
</P>
<P>
   With the arrival of v.90, there's now just one way to get to
56K. While there are some Internet service providers out there
still using the X2 or K56flex schemes, their numbers are dwindling.
</P>
<P>
   However, there remain some asterisks, caveats and footnotes.
Despite the fact that these modems are capable of connecting at
56,000 bits a second, federal regulations regarding phone-line
voltage hold them to a maximum of 53K.
</P>
<P>
   And most folks seldom get that close to the top speed, thanks to
the varying quality of home or business phone wiring; the link to
the phone company's switching equipment; the quality of that
equipment; and the link from there to an Internet provider.
</P>
<P>
   Connections for most users of 56K modems seem to fall in the
40K-48K range, with some poking along at 28.8K or 33.6K.
</P>
<P>
   Different modems will also give different results. I tried out
models from three different manufacturers, and found that, despite
a common standard, their performance was far from uniform.
</P>
<P>
   I tested them in several ways _ connecting to a slower, 28.8K
modem through an older phone-company switch; making a v.90
connection at a major Houston Internet service provider;
downloading a 17-megabyte file using Netscape Navigator 4.07; and
dialing in to a v.90 connection at America Online.
</P>
<P>
   All three were internal models and were tested in a Dell
Dimension PC with a 200-megahertz Pentium MMX chip and 64 megabytes
of memory.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Robotics 56K Faxmodem _ $129, 3Com. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; I've been a happy user of U.S. Robotics modems for some time,
as are many others. This is the best-selling line of consumer
modem, and with good reason _ they are reliable, affordable, speedy
and easy to install. This is the next generation of the line
previously known as the Sportster.
</P>
<P>
   The 56K Faxmodem I tried installed easily, giving Windows 98's
Plug and Play capabilities no problems at all.
</P>
<P>
   When connecting to the older, 28.8K modem, I routinely got
either 24K or 26.4K connections, the same speeds achieved with the
older, 33.6K U.S. Robotics Sportster modem that came with my Dell
system.
</P>
<P>
   However, when I dialed up my Internet provider _ which just
recently upgraded from K56flex to v.90 _ I got a blistering 52K
connection, the fastest of the three I tried. With AOL, I only
managed to get 37.3K.
</P>
<P>
   Downloading the 17-megabyte file via my Internet provider was
slower than with the other modems, averaging about 32.8K a second.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Supra Express 56K _ $100, Diamond Multimedia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Diamond's Supra Express is an excellent modem, a midrange
product that's fast and reliable. At least, once I got it installed
in my computer.
</P>
<P>
   First, it installed to the wrong communications port, grabbing
COM1 away from the serial port in my machine. I had to fiddle with
my Dell's BIOS settings to set things straight.
</P>
<P>
   Windows also wanted to randomly reinstall the drivers for the
Supra on bootup, as though I just plugged it into my machine.
Eventually I got this behavior to stop by downloading Diamond's
latest drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The Supra made 24K and 26.4K connections to the older modem, and
50K connections to my Internet provider. It's interesting that the
Supra did not do as well as the U.S. Robotics modem, because my
provider upgraded from the K56flex standard, which the Supra
supports, while the U.S. Robotics mode supports X2.
</P>
<P>
   When connecting to AOL, the Supra achieved 44K. And the Supra
was the downloading champion, with speeds of 37.6K.
</P>
<P>
   This was the only modem I tried that came with built-in
voice-mail capabilities. The voice software that comes with it is
rudimentary _ a better choice is the latest version of TalkWorks
from Symantec.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Accura Internal Data/Fax v.90 _ $119, Hayes Microcomputer
Products. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It's been 20 years since Hayes designed the PC modem still in
use today, but the company has fallen on hard times. It recently
filed for its second bankruptcy in five years.
</P>
<P>
   For purely sentimental reasons, I was really pulling for the
Accura to kick some kilobutt, but alas, it turned in the worst
performance of the group.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Supra, the Accura gave me problems with installation.
Windows tried to redetect it several times before finally settling
down.
</P>
<P>
   The Accura could only connect to the 28.8K modem at 19.2K,
sometimes ekeing out a piddling 16.8K. It connected to both my
Internet service provider and AOL at 44K, but its download speed
was 36.8K, placing second behind the Supra.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that there are many variables to modem performance
and that these results should serve only as a basic guide. Putting
the same cards in your computer and connecting to different
Internet providers could have dramatically different results.

   WUTHERING HEIGHTS Starring: Robert Cavanah, Orla Brady On: PBS,
Ch. 2 Time: Sunday at 9 p.m. Rated: TVPG
</P>
<P>
   The unadulterated passion of Emily Bronte's prose, along with
the astute direction of William Wyler, inspired one of the most
full-bodied performances of Laurence Olivier's long career. As the
passionate Heathcliff in Wyler's 1939 adaptation of ``Wuthering
Heights,'' Olivier managed to be as stormy and lovely and desolate
as the Yorkshire moors he wandered. His perverse scowl, the ghostly
fire in his eyes, his noble aspect, all projected the movie's
hugely romantic mood.
</P>
<P>
   The latest version of the Bronte classic, presented on
``Masterpiece Theatre'' Sunday night at 9, is far less
traditionally romantic, with a Heathcliff whose anger and fixation
have a decidedly ugly aspect. As played by Robert Cavanah, this
Heathcliff is not just brooding and desperate about a love doomed
to find its satisfaction only in death. He is thornier and more
complicated, by turns amoral, vindictive, violent, and withholding,
and at moments physically unattractive in his twisted contempt for
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Cavanah's unappealing Heathcliff helps to make this ``Wuthering
Heights'' an interestingly grim, if not entirely successful,
adaptation. He's a compellingly dark hero to watch, although you
don't quite feel his tragedy. While the movie contains all the
hyped-up melodrama you'd expect from Bronte's story, with lots of
crying out about the heart and the soul, and with Cathy making
pronouncements like ``I am Heathcliff,' it has very little of the
greatness and righteousness you hope to find in a portrait of a
love bursting at the seams. No one appears to like, never mind
love, anyone else, and even the critical, central relationship
between Cathy and Heathcliff is never fully established before they
are pulled apart. It's assumed. It doesn't help that Orla Brady
never quite captures Cathy's fragility.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Masterpiece Theatre'' adaptation is also unusual in its
loyalty to the plotting of the novel, with the Cathy-Heathcliff
story giving way to the drama of their children. This
multigenerational aspect adds a sense of welcome resolution to the
story, even if it feels a little crammed into the two-hour time
slot.

AUTHOR OF BREAST-CANCER BOOK SAYS REDUCING RISKS BEGINS AT DINNER
TABLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BARBARA KARKABI 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Bob Arnot, chief medical correspondent for NBC News, likes
to describe himself as a ``knowledge engineer'' _ someone who finds
cutting-edge research that has immediate benefit on people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   It's a role he relishes and enjoys.
</P>
<P>
   But when his mother-in-law developed breast cancer and his wife
asked him what she could do to keep from getting breast cancer, the
ever-genial Arnot was at a loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her the standard risk factors, like early periods and
late menopause, the age you have children,'' he said. ``Of course,
I reminded her about breast self-exams and mammograms for early
detection. But beyond that, I thought, there was nothing else she
could really do.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not the answer that Courtney Arnot wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife told me: `Is that all you have to say? You don't have
any idea? Look, you are a medical reporter, you are a doctor,
figure it out.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Her challenge sent Arnot on a journey of discovery that resulted
in his latest book, ``The Breast Cancer Prevention Diet: The
Powerful Foods, Supplements and Drugs That Can Save Your Life''
(Little Brown and Co., $24).
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect to find that much, I thought I would putter
around,'' Arnot said. ``And then I found literally thousands of
articles on soy, for instance, and other foods and how they can be
used to help prevent breast cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough in ``chemoprevention'' _ treating cancer by
preventing it from forming in the first place _ came last spring,
Arnot said, when the drug tamoxifen was shown to cut the risk of
developing breast cancer in high-risk women by 45 percent. Less
than a month later, he said, the drug raloxifene was shown to
decrease the risk by 79 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The total amount of estrogen you are exposed to over a
lifetime is associated with the greatest risk,'' Arnot said. ``We
see estrogen as the fuel that causes breast cancer to grow. We
don't know what causes it or what triggers it. But we do know that
the breast is loaded with estrogen receptors and when too much
estrogen reaches these receptors, the potentially cancerous cells
can grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Tamoxifen and raloxifene are successful because they can block
estrogen from reaching the breast, Arnot said. But both have side
effects, though raloxifene's appear to be less, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the women I interviewed for the book and most I run
into tell me, `Look, those are the drugs and that's nice to have
them, but I'm not going to take them,' '' he said. ``Their attitude
was: `I'm young and I don't have the breast cancer gene. I don't
want to take drugs _ what else can I do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   For those not taking the drugs or those who want to do more, the
good news is that there are specific foods that also can block the
estrogen pathway, Arnot said. Among them are soy and flaxseed.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics show Chinese women, who eat more soy in their diet
than American women, have 80 percent less breast cancer than
Americans. Arnot and his family now start their day with a soy
shake, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Flaxseeds can be ground and added to orange juice, yogurt and
salads. The recommended doses are 35 to 60 grams of soy or 25 grams
of flaxseed a day.
</P>
<P>
   Other recommendations Arnot makes in his book:
</P>
<P>
   Eat healthier fats. Avoid omega-6 fats or the polyunsaturated
fats found in most vegetable oil or minerals. A recent study
reported that polyunsaturated fats increase a woman's risk of
breast cancer by 69 percent. Include small amounts of ``healthy''
fats in your diet such as omega-3 fats, found in fish, and omega-9
fats, found in olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Eat cruciferous vegetables, like broccoli, cabbage and
cauliflower.
</P>
<P>
   Decrease upper-body obesity by losing weight.
</P>
<P>
   Eat more fiber. Fiber interrupts most steps of the estrogen
pathway, he said. Strive for 35-60 grams of fiber a day _ beans and
high fiber cereals are good sources, but increase fiber slowly, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Limit alcohol consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Exercise four hours a week. Try to get within 12 pounds of your
ideal weight.
</P>
<P>
   Arnot recommends different approaches for premenopausal and
postmenopausal women and breast cancer survivors. His book also
includes sample meal plans from Asian and Mediterrean diets, both
of which have demonstrated effectiveness in preventing breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a changing strategy as your risk changes and your age
changes,'' Arnot said. ``Any time you go from diet as a supplement
or diet with specific foods as medicine, you should go over it
carefully with your doctor or someone in a cancer-prevention center
to make sure you are making the right moves.''
</P>
<P>
   Sally Scroggs, a registered dietitian and nutrition counselor in
Houston, agrees that individual counseling is important.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot coming out on diet and prevention and it's an
exciting place to be,'' said Scroggs, who works with the University
of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center's department of clinical
cancer prevention. ``I would love to work with people so they can
interpret from the book what is appropriate for their needs. The
latest research shows that 33 percent to 50 percent of breast
cancer is preventable by diet.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnot said his basic strategy is: If it's something you can do
now as part of a preventive-health program, why not?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know it's not going to hurt you, and there's some pretty
strong evidence that it could help,'' he said. ``It may be 10-15
years before someone has done all the soy studies and fish-oil
studies and so on. But we have a lot of good, safe data. It's a bet
we're making at our house.'' &QL;

A HUMANIZING LOOK AT MUSIC OF MACHINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MODULATIONS
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by: Iara Lee
</P>
<P>
   At: Kendall Square
</P>
<P>
   Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen ninety-seven was the year the mainstream music press
decided to anoint electronica as the next big thing, and despite
success by Prodigy, Chemical Brothers, and Crystal Method, most
people reacted with a shrug. But it didn't matter _ not to the
scores of beat-crazy club kids or the turntable messiahs who find
religion in the uncommon rhythms generated when man lays hands on
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Electronica _ that already-tired catchall label _ existed long
before magazines decided to make Prodigy's Keith Flint a cover boy.
This particular art of noise is celebrated in Iara Lee's
fascinating ``Modulations,'' which traces the evolution of
electronic music from Luigi Russolo's promotion of industrial noise
in 1913 to the modern sounds of ambient, techno, and house cranking
it up in clubs from San Francisco to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic music pioneer John Cage is featured in archival
footage, but the film concentrates on technology's influence on pop
music from disco to hip-hop to jazz. It won't matter if you can't
tell nasty ghetto house from Detroit techno or ambient, a naked
penguin scratch from a crab scratch. Lee's film should appeal to
tech-heads and neophytes alike, as she makes the point that
electronic music has always been with us and continues to be one of
the most creative forces in music today.
</P>
<P>
   For the purveyors of electronic music, every sounds pulses with
rhythmic potential. Electronic producer Tetsu Inoue records a host
of sounds, from those of washing a glass to the hum of a microwave,
all to use on later productions. Writer David Toop says electronic
music is ``a direct reflection of the environment,'' and Lee's film
proves he's right.
</P>
<P>
   But the film is more than just a scientific dissection of the
music. It explores convincingly, say, how techno, the beat-heavy
dance music popularized in the late 1980s and early 1990s, became
the sound of Detroit. The city's black youth, still struggling with
the 1960s legacy of riots and unrest, sought to create music that
recalled the unrest, even as the blips and beeps elevated the music
to a type of space symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Lee also captures the energy of the music and its devotees. It's
impossible not to get swept into the moment as Afrika Bambaataa's
classic ``Planet Rock,'' which borrowed from and deconstructed the
work of German electronic music pioneers Kraftwerk, pumps into a
packed dance club.
</P>
<P>
   And the film hails Robert Moog, inventor of the Moog
synthesizer, and Giorgio Moroder, whose work with Donna Summer in
the 1970s, particularly on her hypnotic hit, ``I Feel Love,''
revolutionized and realized the potential of music made with
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the film's greatest asset is giving electronica its
rightful place in the music pantheon, proving that music made with
machines is not necessarily devoid of human passions or spiritual
release.

much or they will try to bring down his government. Friday, they

   CHINA-CNN _ BEIJING Chinese authorities have once again set up
electronic barriers on the internet aimed at blocking the 1 million
web users in China from accessing the CNN and British Broadcasting
Company websites. The spokesman of China's ruling State Council
declined to answer a written query on why average netsurfers in
Beijing could no longer dial up CNN website. ``It's not an easy
question to handle,'' said an official in the State Council's
information office. During the glow of openness before and during
President Bill Clinton's visit to China three months ago, both the
CNN and BBC websites were freely accessable to Chinese computer
users, as China appeared to be paring down its list of ``banned''
sites. But then this week, the BBC said the main state controlled
internet service provider ChinaNet was ``believed to be blocking
access'' to its main London-based site called bbc.co.uk. As a
result, the BBC said, web surfers in China were unable to access
the BBC's new web-based Mandarin language broadcast and transcript
service. CNN has made no similar announcement. (Kunstel/Albright,

unveil an austerity package to stave off a crisis by Oct. 20. With
a pool of 164 million consumers, companies like Coca-Cola and IBM
have a major stake in Brazil's future. In addition, Brazil is
Florida's biggest trading partner. Despite reassurances from the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank that relief will be
provided, economists -- and more importantly, banks and investors
-- have become increasingly pessimistic. (Emling, Cox News

   CONGRESS-RECORD _ WASHINGTON _ This 105th Congress has been
compared to the ``Do-Nothing'' 85th Congress excoriated by
President Harry Truman in 1948. But as it leaves town, the 105th
Congress left behind a record of major decisions that most
Americans liked. The five-year budget-balancing agreement and the
gigantic tax-cut package adopted by this Congress in 1997 seem to
be working. This year, Congress overwhelmingly adopted legislation
overhauling the IRS, providing multi-year funding for highways and
mass transit, and making major repairs in two troubled programs --
low-income housing and job-training. Perhaps its least-noticed
accomplishment will be restraint: It passed fewer laws than any
Congress in recent history and avoided divisive party-line splits
during this year's preparations for next year's efforts to repair
Social Security. (Mollison, Cox News Service 700).
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-MAJORITY _ WASHINGTON _ If Republicans increase their
Senate majority to 60 seats in the 106th Congress, President
Clinton could find himself under more pressure to use his veto
power even as he defends himself in an impeachment trial. Without
the 41 votes needed to sustain a Senate filibuster, the Democrats'
ability to block legislation or force compromises would be
weakened. History shows that such situations can lead to a high
number of presidential vetoes. (Mollison, Cox News Service).

 &HT;    ISRAELI SETTLERS KEEP THE HEAT ON NETANYAHU, U.S.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Through protests here and calls on their American
friends, Israeli settler leaders are attempting to make sure Israel
takes a tough stand in the talks this weekend at Maryland's Wye
Plantation.
</P>
<P>
   Long opposed to the Oslo peace process and controversial in
their own country, settler leaders do not want the land around
their neighborhoods turned over to Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
National Authority. If it must be, they say, Arafat must step up
his fight against terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respect to the American policy, we are not
willing to sit here and pay the price in blood . . . to boost
President Clinton's standing in American politics,'' Yehudit Tayar,
spokeswoman for the settler association, YESHA, said from her
Washington hotel Friday.
</P>
<P>
   YESHA spent three days meeting with American supporters and
sympathetic officials in U.S. Congress ahead of the Middle East
summit.
</P>
<P>
   Currently in Maryland, Clinton wants Netanyahu to withdraw
Israeli troops from another 13 percent of the West Bank, a
Palestinian area captured by Israel since the Six Day War of 1967.
American officials have also pleaded, along with Arafat, that
Israel stop settlement expansion.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Arafat is being asked to agree to a tight schedule of
steps for fighting anti-Israeli terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   A newspaper poll this Friday showed that 57 percent of Israelis
favor the 13 percent plan. But, the hard-line settlers are among
the best organized and vocal of Israeli interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Settlers backed Netanyahu, who himself used to oppose Oslo.
Together, they have been successful in slowing down the Oslo
process. Now, the settlers threaten to topple him if he concedes
too much in what they see as an American political show.
</P>
<P>
   They look to members of Congress, especially Republicans, who
have often supported both the settlers and Netanyahu in their tense
relations with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Settlers fear that their neighborhoods, many resembling
condominium developments with with schools and stores, could end up
isolated if Arafat gets more land. Israel has already pulled out of
Palestinian population centers.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, settlers blocked a West Bank road in protest after
Palestinian police reportedly beat two settlement security guards
who had chased rock-throwing youth into Palestinian territory.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1967, Israeli leaders have authorized the construction of
more than 140 settlements, housing about 170,000 people, in the
West Bank. They are spread in a pattern that makes it impossible
for the Palestinians to get a solid block of territory.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Israeli group, Peace Now, about 3,000 new
housing units have been started in the last 17 months, even while
nearly as many units are already vacant.
</P>
<P>
   The Geneva Convention says countries should not move their
population into occupied territories unless it is necessary for
security.
</P>
<P>
   Settlers say their neighborhoods provide a buffer between Israel
and hostile neighbors, but others here say many provide no security
benefit. The Israeli government provides tax breaks and other
benefits to settlers.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. President George Bush withheld loans to Israel when
he suspected American aid was used to finance settlement
construction.

WORD PLAYERS: AUSTIN'S GLAM-FREE FILM FESTIVAL SPOTLIGHTS
SCREENWRITERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the writer who's the star of Austin's annual Heart of Film
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   That's probably why, when the ``new'' version of ``Blood
Simple'' _ coated with an extra layer of irony via its updated
title, ``Blood Simple: Forever Young'' _ was about to start, there
were awed whispers about its authors, Joel and Ethan Coen, sitting
right in the theater. (''Blood Simple'' was also made in Austin,
and is one of the first independent films to call attention to the
singular allure of the city.) The Coens embody the kind of success
on their own terms that was the talk, and the envy, of the
festival.
</P>
<P>
   The Heart of Film Festival, which celebrated its fifth
anniversary this year, isn't Cannes _ and it doesn't try to be.
Part of the festival involves panels with screenwriters and
industry insiders discussing matters such as problems that writers
might have in selling and writing their scripts.
</P>
<P>
   The rest is the screening schedule, which runs through October
and includes roughly 40 films, including the North American
premieres of the anticipated fall releases ``Pleasantville'' and
``Apt Pupil.'' This festival exists first and foremost to welcome
and encourage a dialogue between screenwriters and encourage them
in their work, which distinguishes it from other festivals, such as
the glitzy Telluride and Sundance events.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Coen brothers were the only notables attending.
Dale Launer, a confident example of mainstream accomplishment whose
credits include ``My Cousin Vinny,'' ``Ruthless People'' and
``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' and who also looks forward to the day
when he can direct his own scripts with money he pulls together on
his own, was there. So was Paul Schrader, whose work as a writer
includes ``Taxi Driver'' and ``Raging Bull'' and, as a
writer-director, ``American Gigolo,'' ``Light Sleeper'' and the
upcoming ``Affliction'' with Nick Nolte.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader was this year's special guest of the festival, and
despite the brooding nature of much of his work, was affable and
friendly. He almost had no choice, with the number of worshipful
aspiring screenwriters who ambled up to him to express their
admiration. (The Coens, because they bounced in and out, primarily
to show the re-release of their 1985 debut ``Blood Simple,''
weren't subjected to as much contact as was Schrader.)
</P>
<P>
   It was a shrewd idea to focus on screenwriters, the most
underappreciated members of the filmmaking team. Louis B. Mayer
dismissed them in his day as ``schmucks with Underwoods
(typewriters).'' In F. Scott Fitzgerald's ``The Last Tycoon,''
Monroe Stahr _ the iconlike studio head based on Irving Thalberg _
says, ``I'll give my writers money, but I won't give them power.''
So the festival creators understood the need to reach out to
writers, as much out of affection as to give the Heart of Film
Festival a profile. Especially since this festival comes during the
fall, a period that includes some of the most important film
festivals of the year: Telluride, Montreal, Toronto and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw a need,'' says co-founder Barbara Morgan, ``and stepped
in to fill it. Austin was becoming an important film center. So
many film people live here and spend time here, and it didn't make
sense for it to not have a festival.''
</P>
<P>
   The cooperative vibe of the festival was present at the
wind-down gatherings that came together every night in the
construction-site bar at the Driskill Hotel. Adorned with huge
pages from William Goldman's ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid''
script (which ended up being wrongly identified as ``There's
Something About Mary'' by the talented Austin American Statesman
writer Michael Corcoran, who was then laughingly corrected by
Schrader), the hotel became official watering hole for eager
screenwriters-to-be, the place where they gathered to tell stories
about hero sightings and to swap scripts.
</P>
<P>
   Austin is a natural for such a pleasant gathering; even the
occasional technical problems were greeted with good will. One
young writer was excited to witness something he'd never seen
before: One of the films made contact with the projection lamps and
melted before his eyes. ``It was so coooool,'' he trilled. But
instead of the mishap causing a riot, the moviegoers sat patiently
and waited for corrections to be made. And when a gaffe forced a
screening of writer-director Gary Ross' ``Pleasantville'' to halt,
Schrader took Ross aside and calmed him down. (Again, the audience
was perfectly willing to wait until things were repaired.)
</P>
<P>
   The same good-natured feeling permeated the panels, which were
filled with attentive audiences bobbing for information like
goldfish for food. At one panel, which dealt with how writers
should pitch their script ideas to producers and studios, one
panelist _ a high-priced scribe whose credits include ``Air Force
One'' _ said, ``You're asking someone to give you a lot of money
for your idea. Sixty thousand or $70,000 for ...''
</P>
<P>
   At which point, one of the producer panelists _ aware of what a
bargain this was _ interjected, ``I'll give $75,000 right now.''
Another producer panelist chimed in: ``I bid $80,000!''
</P>
<P>
   Not the kind of exchange you'd likely hear at Cannes.

   MIAMI _ Picture the country of Brazil as just one free-wheeling,
spend-happy consumer.
</P>
<P>
   He gulps Coca-Cola, vacations in Florida, and feels lost without
his cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   Now imagine that he's broke.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, it's easy to see why economic troubles in
Brazil -- home to 164 million potential consumers -- could deal a
devastating blow to U.S. businesses as wide-ranging as Coca-Cola
Co., Motorola Inc., and Walt Disney Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Boasting the world's ninth-largest economy, the South American
country has become a major concern for analysts and investors who
fear that Brazil could plunge into recession by 1999, or be forced
to avert recession with a currency devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Brazil hopes to receive a bailout of up to $30
billion assembled by the International Monetary Fund, or IMF, to
help stabilize the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
   But the economy could still crumble if President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso fails to implement an austerity package he is
expected to announce by Oct. 20, and somehow push through Brazil's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso faces the daunting challenge of needing to cut the
government's 8 percent budget deficit, overhaul a shaky social
security system, and adjust a 15 to 20 percent over-valuation in
Brazil's currency.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high because economic woes in Brazil portend
economic woes throughout the rest of Latin America, which would
place the global financial crisis smack on the doorstep of the
American public.
</P>
<P>
   ``People forget how important Brazil is to the U.S. economy, but
the export market in Brazil is 25 percent bigger than China's,''
said David Hirschmann, executive vice president of the Brazil-U.S.
Business Council in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Brazil's importance is best explained in numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's $800 billion-a-year economy is twice the size of
Russia's and nearly twice the size of Mexico's. More than 400 of
the top 500 U.S. companies have subsidiaries in Brazil. The country
accounts for 45 percent of Latin America's output.
</P>
<P>
   And here are just a few ways in which Brazil and the U.S.
economy are inextricably linked:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  American banks had made $34 billion in outstanding loans to
Brazil by September.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More than one million Brazilian tourists vacation in the
United States each year.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  U.S. corporations have more than $25 billion invested in
Brazilian factories.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors wonder whether Brazil's precarious economic
situation might take some of the steam out of the future earnings
of companies that have made big investments there.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is Coca-Cola's third-largest market, behind the United
States and Mexico. The Atlanta-based company and its bottlers,
which employ 42,000 people in Brazil, invested $1.4 billion in
infrastructure and marketing in Brazil from 1995 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a lot of potential in Brazil,'' said Bill Hensel, a
spokesman for Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, Motorola Inc., just won a five-year, $220
million contract from Brazil's Global Telecom to supply a cellular
phone network system in southern Brazil. Motorola completed a
50,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Brazil only last year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Brazil's future certainly will have repercussions
on Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Trade between Brazil and Florida totaled more than $8 billion
last year, meaning Brazil has become Florida's most-important
trading partner.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200,000 Brazilians live in Florida, and most of the
one million Brazilians who visit the United States each year travel
to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of the U.S. exports that go to Brazil go through Florida
or are produced in Florida,'' Hirschmann said. ``You could argue a
compelling case that, in fact, the way Brazil goes, so will go
Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for the future of Brazil's economy have been running high
since Oct. 4, when Cardoso, credited with stabilizing his country's
currency in recent years, became the first president in 109 years
of the Brazilian republic to be re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   Even the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank have
promised to help Brazil make economic reforms, although neither has
specified how much financing will be offered.
</P>
<P>
   But now all eyes are on how well Cardoso's allies fare during
the second round of Brazil's national elections scheduled for Oct.
25.
</P>
<P>
   The 67-year-old sociologist will have a tough time cutting back
on public spending without the key support of Brazil's governors.
</P>
<P>
   All eyes also are focused on Congress, which has proved to be a
stumbling block to Cardoso's plans for reform in the past.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim follows.)
</P>
<P>
   During Cardoso's first term he repeatedly failed to push
money-saving reforms to the public sector through Congress,
preferring the line of least resistance and raising taxes that did
not require congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time Cardoso did move on other important fronts:
he privatized several bloated state monopolies, including the
country's phone company; and he helped Brazil draw massive amounts
of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   And, earlier this year, Cardoso's government managed to avoid a
collapse of the currency and stem at least some capital flight by
hiking interest rates to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's why some economists are reluctant to predict whether
Cardoso can be successful this time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``The uncertainty in Brazil is whether the Congress has been
shaken from its complacency and whether reforms can actually be
passed,'' said Don Bowler, regional director for Latin America for
the Economist Intelligence Unit in London, an economic research
firm. ``I'm not sure they can because there's not a lot of party
unity in Brazil and there is a wide range of views within the
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso supporters say the mounting urgency of the world's
financial crisis will give the president the muscle he needs to
deal with Congress this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cardoso and his team are smart and they know what needs to be
done,'' said James Ferrer, head of the Institute of Brazilian
Issues at George Washington University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer said he expects Cardoso's package to include sharp
spending cuts, some small tax increases, and reforms to the social
security system.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends.)
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts agree that the government wants to do all it can
to avoid a devaluation of the real, which would send shock waves
through a population that fears a return to the days of
hyperinflation that ended just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso was a popular finance minister whose 1994 currency plan
brought price increases to zero from 3,000 percent in less than
four years.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, foreign currency reserves, the best defense
against a speculative attack on the real, have plummeted from $67
billion at the end of August to $47 billion today.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's devaluation of the ruble in August scared U.S.
investors away from emerging markets such as Brazil, causing
dollars to disappear faster than candy before hungry children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone expects a devaluation except, perhaps,
Cardoso and his associates,'' said Jerry Haar, director of the
Inter-American Business and Labor Program at the University of
Miami's North-South Center.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Cardoso may be forced to devalue if the country
keeps hemorrhaging money in the public sector due to the lack of
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Brazil, you can work for the government for 10 years and
still retire at 110 percent of your salary,'' Haar said.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts agree that Cardoso's plan must shave at least $25
billion off a whopping public deficit of $60 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a devaluation would almost surely throw the economy
into a recession, as well as reintroduce high inflation.
</P>
<P>
   And it most certainly would erode the spending power of
Brazilian consumers and businesses, hurting U.S. exporters.

 &HT;    ISRAELI SETTLERS KEEP THE HEAT ON NETANYAHU, U.S.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Through protests here and calls on their American
friends, Israeli settler leaders are attempting to make sure Israel
takes a tough stand in the talks this weekend at Maryland's Wye
Plantation.
</P>
<P>
   Long opposed to the Oslo peace process and controversial in
their own country, settler leaders do not want the land around
their neighborhoods turned over to Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
National Authority. If it must be, they say, Arafat must step up
his fight against terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respect to the American policy, we are not
willing to sit here and pay the price in blood . . . to boost
President Clinton's standing in American politics,'' Yehudit Tayar,
spokeswoman for the settler association, YESHA, said from her
Washington hotel Friday.
</P>
<P>
   YESHA spent three days meeting with American supporters and
sympathetic officials in U.S. Congress ahead of the Middle East
summit.
</P>
<P>
   Currently in Maryland, Clinton wants Netanyahu to withdraw
Israeli troops from another 13 percent of the West Bank, a
Palestinian area captured by Israel since the Six Day War of 1967.
American officials have also pleaded, along with Arafat, that
Israel stop settlement expansion.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Arafat is being asked to agree to a tight schedule of
steps for fighting anti-Israeli terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   A newspaper poll this Friday showed that 57 percent of Israelis
favor the 13 percent plan. But, the hard-line settlers are among
the best organized and vocal of Israeli interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Settlers backed Netanyahu, who himself used to oppose Oslo.
Together, they have been successful in slowing down the Oslo
process. Now, the settlers threaten to topple him if he concedes
too much in what they see as an American political show.
</P>
<P>
   They look to members of Congress, especially Republicans, who
have often supported both the settlers and Netanyahu in their tense
relations with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Settlers fear that their neighborhoods, many resembling
condominium developments with with schools and stores, could end up
isolated if Arafat gets more land. Israel has already pulled out of
Palestinian population centers.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, settlers blocked a West Bank road in protest after
Palestinian police reportedly beat two settlement security guards
who had chased rock-throwing youth into Palestinian territory.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1967, Israeli leaders have authorized the construction of
more than 140 settlements, housing about 170,000 people, in the
West Bank. They are spread in a pattern that makes it impossible
for the Palestinians to get a solid block of territory.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Israeli group, Peace Now, about 3,000 new
housing units have been started in the last 17 months, even while
nearly as many units are already vacant.
</P>
<P>
   The Geneva Convention says countries should not move their
population into occupied territories unless it is necessary for
security.
</P>
<P>
   Settlers say their neighborhoods provide a buffer between Israel
and hostile neighbors, but others here say many provide no security
benefit. The Israeli government provides tax breaks and other
benefits to settlers.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. President George Bush withheld loans to Israel when
he suspected American aid was used to finance settlement
construction.

CANDIDATE MIFFED THAT HER CHINESE NAME WAS OMITTED FROM BALLOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A candidate for president of the Board of
Supervisors criticized election officials for omitting her Chinese
name from absentee ballots, claiming it could cost her thousands of
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Mabel Teng's Chinese name, as well as the
transliterated Chinese names of six other candidates for local
offices, were omitted from thousands of absentee ballots already
sent out citywide. All other local candidates had their names
properly translated into Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Teng's campaign manager threatened to sue the election officials
if corrected ballots were not sent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the only Chinese incumbent running for re-election. How
can my (Chinese) name be missing from the ballot?'' Teng said
Thursday during a news conference in Chinatown.
</P>
<P>
   Naomi Nishioka, director of the Department of Elections, said
the omission was not an error. Although Chinese and Spanish
translation of occupations and other designations on the ballot is
required, translation of names is an optional service offered by
her department. The only other time it was done was the 1995
mayoral race.
</P>
<P>
   She said Teng's campaign was called twice to ask whether the
candidate wanted her name printed in Chinese on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone from my staff called her again and said, `Are you sure
you don't want your name translated because most of the other
candidates are doing it,''' Nishioka said. ``We were told by her
campaign managers that they didn't wish to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   John Whitehurst, Teng's campaign manager, said it was thought
the question referred to the candidate statement in the voter
information pamphlet, not the ballot itself.
</P>
<P>
   Teng demanded that new absentee booklets be printed and sent out
with a corrective letter to those who have received the faulty
ones. Whitehurst said a lawsuit would be filed if proper steps were
not taken to remedy the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Every vote is critical in an election where Teng is seen as
running neck-and-neck with Supervisor Tom Ammiano for board
presidency. Past races for the board presidency have hinged on just
a few hundred votes.
</P>
<P>
   Nishioka said it was too late to reprint booklets; 100,000 have
been printed and 47,000 have been sent out. However, she said
Chinese voter information pamphlets, which are requested by 13,000
voters, would contain the Chinese names.
</P>
<P>
   But Teng said her concern was not merely political.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this situation is not corrected by the Department of
Elections, Chinese voters _ many of them new immigrants, many
registered for the first time _ will be disenfranchised,'' she
said.

CURTIS MARTIN SAYS HE HAS NO SECOND THOUGHTS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ The memories are of Curtis Martin sitting by
his locker, next to Jimmy Hitchcock or Corwin Brown or Sam Gash,
sitting in the Patriots' locker room, always willing to talk in
that soft and gentle voice. In time, especially if the crowd around
him was small, Martin would open up.
</P>
<P>
   But now it all looked and felt and seemed so strange. There was
Martin sitting in the small media room at Hofstra University, a
microphone in front of him, banks of videocams focused on his face
... and most of all, that Jets cap on his head. This was not a
setting to draw out the inner feelings of a football player;
details were few from Martin's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said Martin. ``I definitely have no second thoughts
about leaving (the Patriots). I'm very appreciative and grateful
for where I'm at, and that's my attitude. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   No, not a ``period,'' definitely not. This situation, and
whatever is said about it _ whether the Jets or the Patriots are
better off since Martin left New England for New York as a
restricted free agent _ can be followed only by a question mark.
Even if the first answers will be coming Monday night when the
teams meet at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a lot of excitement,'' said Martin when
asked what he expects when he trots onto the Foxboro Stadium turf
for the first time in a Jets uniform. ``It'll be a lot of fun. It's
definitely something that I'm looking forward to. Of course,
there's more feeling and emotional meaning to it because of the
rivalry that has developed.''
</P>
<P>
   The ground rules for the mass interview were laid down by the
Jets. No questions about injuries. So Martin could not be asked
about his strained quadriceps or the 30 or so times he carried the
ball after letting his coaches know he had been nicked in the first
quarter of the Miami game two weeks ago. Martin remained in the
game but missed last week's game against St. Louis. He most likely
will play against New England.
</P>
<P>
   When the New York media asked Bill Parcells after the Miami game
if he were concerned about preserving Martin's body for the
duration of the season, the coach gave a most Parcellsian response:
``I'm not in the preservation business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of expect all of that,'' replied Martin when asked if
he figured New England fans would cheer him, boo him, or throw
things at him. ``I don't know whether they'll cheer or boo. That's
not going to be my focus. I'm going there to play ball.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the fans do, said Martin, just being on the oh so
familiar Foxboro turf will be comfortable since ``you know you're
used to running on that field. You're used to that crowd. It's
definitely somewhere where I'm used to playing. But it'll be
playing as the ... uh ... enemy ... versus being on that side.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he think the Foxborough fans might be as rough on him as
they were last year when Parcells made his first return and heard a
mixture of cheers and boos?
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I said, I don't know ... I don't know exactly how it'll
be,'' said Martin. ``I'm expecting all different kinds of things.
But I'm not really worried about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's mother, Rochella, already is on record as saying that
she had a mother-son chat about Martin's getting booed in
Foxborough. ``It's not going to affect Curt,'' Rochella Martin told
the New York Daily News, ``but I'm not going to lie to you. I'm
going to be fired up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets running back, of course, was one of the more beloved
Patriots, both by the fans in the stands and his teammates in the
locker room. Martin did concede that playing against New England
``will be a good thing; it'll be like playing against a lot of your
friends. That's always something that gets you extra pumped up,
playing against people that you know ... personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, personally.
</P>
<P>
   Few fans in New England need to be reminded that the owner of
the New England Patriots and the coach of the New York Jets are
obsessed with each other. Parcells thought he had weakened the
Patriots considerably by stealing Martin from New England in free
agency, then sending last year's solid running back, Adrian
Murrell, to the Cardinals with the proviso that Arizona would not
send Murrell to New England.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots countered by using the draft pick the Jets had to
give up for signing Martin to select running back Robert Edwards in
the draft. Five games into one season do not provide an accurate
gauge of those moves by the Jets and the Patriots _ only years will
tell the full story _ but so far, it is owner Bob Kraft and the New
England coaches wearing the wide smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a gaping void at running back with the loss of the
elusive Martin, the Patriots have a different style with Edwards _
an aggressive power runner who has been delivering more and more in
each game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a different take when you're on the outside
looking in versus being in the situation,'' said Martin when asked
about his move from Foxborough to New York. ``It's your decision.
You have to realize it's your life. It's not everyone else's life
for me to live. You know, I have to live my life and do what I have
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's mother also told the Daily News that it was she, not
her son, who lobbied for Martin to leave the Patriots. ``It was
time to take another route and I told him to go,'' Martin's mother
said. ``I made the decision; I'm sure it was a tossup for him, but
we sat down and thought about it, and the best choice was for him
to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to elaborate on why he left the Patriots, Martin said, ``I
just felt it was a great situation for myself. Bill and the
coaching staff here ... (running backs coach) Maurice Carthon ...
it was definitely a great opportunity for me to be back with the
coaches I came into the NFL with. That played a great role in it.
That influenced me more than any other situation would have.''
</P>
<P>
   With no dominant quarterback, the expectations for Martin here
were that he might carry much of the offense. That was never his
role with the Patriots _ the New England passing and running games
were true complements _ and his effectiveness in New York will be
directly related to whether the Jets ever get their QB situation
settled and put together a threatening passing game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the type of player that no matter what, no matter if I was
having my best year ever, would think it was good enough right
now,'' said Martin. ``But being that's not the case so far, that's
definitely not good enough for me. I believe _ and hopefully, it'll
happen _ that things will get much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially Monday night. For Martin remembers the circus and
hoopla and hype from Tuna Bowl I in Foxborough last year ``when I
had that feeling that it was like playing against your brother.
Parcells was the coach and many of us liked him, but when he came
(back to New England), many of us wanted to make sure we'd win.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin did so, gaining 199 yards to save the Patriots from
themselves in a 27-24 overtime victory.
</P>
<P>
   And now Martin will be the centerpiece of Monday's revival of
the New York-New England jihad. ``You're pumped up for every game,
but there are certain games ... there are certain situations where
it's different,'' said Martin. ``Such as this game. It has formed
into a rivalry. I've been talking to some of the guys (on the
Patriots) and I've been saying, `It's been fun to play with you and
now it'll be fun to play against you.'''

``MIGHTY'' BOND BETWEEN UNLIKELY FRIENDS INSPIRES

   THE MIGHTY &QC; 
Directed by: Peter Chelsom &QC; 
Screenplay by: Charles Leavitt (based on Rodman Philbrick's novel,
``Freak the Mighty'') &QC;

Anderson, James Gandolfini, Kieran Culkin, Eldon Henson, Meat Loaf,

<P>
   &UR; ufbitelabel &LR; MovieReview
</P>
<P>
   A screenful of offbeat elements come together soaringly in ``The
Mighty,'' a film that rides the simpatico chemistry of its two
young stars _ El-H den Henson's schoolboy hulk, hiding a sensitive,
traumatized soul beneath a numbed exterior, and Kieran Culkin's
bold, brainy spirit in a body crunched and twisted by a bone
disorder known as Morquio syndrome. They meet and bond after the
bright little kid is assigned to tutor and improve the reading
skills of the slow, inhibited bigger kid next door.
</P>
<P>
   It's a short jump from their joint traversal of the legend of
King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table to their
idealistically setting forth on a round of noble adventures in
their shabby south Cincinnati neighborhood and in even shabbier
Covington, Ky., just across the Ohio River. With Culkin's Kevin
sitting atop the shoulders of Hen-H son's Max, supplying ideas and
direction while Max supplies the strength and legs, they settle for
taming bullies instead of slaying dragons, and re- turning a stolen
purse in lieu of rescuing a lady in distress.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -------------------- &LR;  Director Peter Chelsom expands upon the
originality he displayed in ``Funny Bones'' and ``Hear My Song,''
making the most of the novelty of the Cincinnati setting, then
exchanging gritty realism for magic realism, with inserts of the
imaginary knights momentarily appearing in vi- sionary ways.
Culkin, sparrow-bright beneath his spectacles, easily convinces us
he has long ago ac- quired the knack of using his mind to propel
him- self out of his hammered little body, while the bulky,
buzz-cut Henson is convincingly gentle.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Stone takes a back seat to the spotlit boys as Kevin's
fiercely loving, hardscrabble sin- gle mother. But she makes every
moment of her  &UR; -------------------- &LR;  screen time count in a smart,
edgy, feeling perfor- mance worthy of a best supporting actress
Oscar, not only touching us with what we see in her eyes and never
is verbalized, but supplying in every gesture the socioeconomic
underpinning the story needs to anchor it and keep it from seeming
sus- pended in a nebulous realm of fable. Deglamor-H ized and
scoured clean of all vestiges of her femme fatale roles, Stone
convinces as a woman who has spent her life in worn-out places, and
has taken more than her share of hits, but isn't about to give up.
</P>
<P>
   Gena Rowlands and Harry Dean Stanton are rock-solid as Max's
kindly American Gothic L grandparents, James Gandolfini delivers
the kind of lowlife menace as Max's psychopathic escaped jailbird
dad that reinforces the film's Huck-Tom dimension, and Gillian
Armstrong neatly sidesteps the pitfalls of her heart-of-gold broken
blossom role. Only at the end does sentimental manipulati-H veness
spill over into obviousness. Even so, ``The Mighty'' earns its
responses and will get to a wide range of moviegoers, much as the
underrated but similar and similarly affecting ``Simon Birch'' has.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT TRIAL HOLDS HUGE STAKES FOR INDUSTRY, CONSUMERS
 &HT;    900&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's being called the antitrust trial of the
decade, pitting the Justice Department and 20 state attorneys
general against Microsoft Corp., the world's leading software
company.
</P>
<P>
   When the Microsoft trial opens here Monday, in the same federal
courthouse where a grand jury probing the White House sex scandal
still sits, the stakes for the future of the computer industry
could prove every bit as large as the impeachment trauma facing
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   While predictions are risky in the fast-paced digital age, a
Microsoft victory would likely further tighten the software giant's
grip on the personal computer world. But if the government lawsuit
succeeds, both businesses and consumers could end up with many more
individual choices on their desktops as Microsoft's vast powers
wane.
</P>
<P>
   The government charges that Microsoft has leveraged its Windows
operating system monopoly into new markets by outbidding the
competition for third-party takeovers, by taking over the
competition directly, by giving away products the competition
sought to sell for a profit, and by hiring away the competition's
best minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than competing legitimately and on the merits,
Microsoft has resorted to predatory and anticompetitive agreements
and conduct,'' the prosecutors wrote in a pre-trial summary of the
case.
</P>
<P>
   On an NBC news special about Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates that
aired in 1995, the company's president, Steve Ballmer, voiced the
firm's take-no-prisoners approach toward its rivals _ an approach
the prosecution plans to highlight in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys can be taken,'' Ballmer said. ``'But the only way
we're going to take them is by studying them. Know what they know.
Do what they do. Watch them, watch them, watch them. Look for every
angle. Stay on their shoulders. Clone them. Take every one of their
good ideas and make it one of our good ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's brief cites a comment by Ruthann Quindlen, a
Silicon Valley venture capitalist who helped take Microsoft public
in 1986. After learning of the areas that Microsoft regards as
off-limits to other innovators, she noted at a recent investment
forum: ``I guess that leaves us washing machines or toasters.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Justice brought its case in May, the appeals court
found that U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson had
erred in an earlier related case that revolved around Windows 95.
In that case, the higher court said Jackson should not have
second-guessed Microsoft's decision to bundle its Internet Explorer
browser within Windows.
</P>
<P>
   With that ruling in mind, the prosecutors restructured their
brief away from the firm's alleged mistreatment of Netscape
Communications Corp. to allege _ based on an 1890 statute _ that
Microsoft had engaged in a broad series of illegal acts to protect
its Windows monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Each side is limited to 14 witnesses in the case, which is
expected to last eight weeks. The government plans to call key
players at Apple Computer Co., America Online Inc., IBM, Intel
Corp., Intuit Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. The star witness for
the prosecution, however, will be James Barksdale, president and
chairman of Netscape, Microsoft's longstanding rival in the browser
wars.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's briefs, however, argue that it was Netscape's poor
strategic policies that have caused its recent fiscal woes. With
the case virtually certain to be appealed clear to the Supreme
Court, the defense team will seek to establish a factual record
that Microsoft had never sought to persuade Netscape to ``divide
the market'' for Web browsing software.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the 12 initial defense witnesses are key Microsoft
employees. Before the trial concludes, Jackson, who will try the
case without a jury, will hear testimony from two further defense
witnesses whose identities have not been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft does not plan to call Gates. But videotaped pretrial
testimony by the firm's co-founder and the world's richest man will
likely be injected into the trial.
</P>
<P>
   John Rose, a senior vice president and group general manager for
</P>
<P>
   enterprise computing at Compaq, will also testify on behalf of
the software giant. Houston-based Compaq is known in the trade as
an OEM, or original equipment manufacturer, and it sells units
pre-loaded with Microsoft's browser, initially programmed to pop up
as the users' first screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's curious that the government hasn't called an OEM
if they think OEMs have been unduly harmed and influenced,'' said
Jonathan Zuck, executive director of the Association for
Competitive Technology in Washington. The association, an advocacy
group of about 200 computer-related companies, argues that the
computer industry is best left unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, however, want Microsoft to grant OEM's unfettered
control of what should appear on a buyer's first screen. They also
want Microsoft to sever its exclusionary contracts with Internet
content and service providers.
</P>
<P>
   At a midweek meeting of key Microsoft purchasers in Orlando,
Gates said the case has had little effect on his company so far.
``There's no change in what we are doing in terms of the focus _
the product design or any of that _ that has been brought about by
that matter,'' Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   And he predicted that his company's aggressive business
practices would survive the antitrust scrutiny. ``We are very
confident _ particularly with the clear criteria that the appeals
court has laid down (in an earlier case) _ that that kind of
innovation is a great thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Which side prevails in this stage of the legal battle may rest
on how Jackson weighs Microsoft's intent.
</P>
<P>
   What motivated Microsoft to incorporate its Internet Explorer
browser into the Windows 95 operating system, and Windows 98, its
successor? Were these true business decisions, rooted in the notion
that the firm's customers sought an integrated product? Or were
they aimed at harming Netscape?
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers recognize that, under the antitrust laws, the same set
of actions could be deemed legal or illegal, depending on
underlying motives.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, current Windows code, used in 97 per cent of
personal computers currently being shipped, is so tightly
interwoven with the browser that the operating system would fail if
they were to be pulled apart.
</P>
<P>
   So software engineers recognize that any adverse legal outcome
for Microsoft would not easily lend itself to a quick fix _ short
of spinning Windows off into a regulated digital utility, a drastic
remedy that the government has so far rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it hard to believe you can have a case where a company
is found to have violated the law, but there's nothing you can do
about it,'' says Robert Bork, a former federal appeals' court judge
who serves as a consultant to Netscape for the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Microsoft wins this case,'' says William Kovacic of George
Mason University Law School, ``you're going to see a major retreat
in the Justice Department's willingness to bring future antitrust
cases.''
</P>
<P>
   In the run-up to the trial, the government has argued that,
should it prevail, Microsoft could be forced to include the
Netscape browser in Windows. But Kovacic believes that even such an
outcome would, in the end, serve only to further bolster Microsoft.
``It will be seen as delivering magic beans for the cow,'' he
concluded.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    As the evidence has mounted against President Clinton, I
believed that he would resign in shame and in the best interests of
our country. But it is now obvious that Clinton will not
voluntarily resign.
 &HT;    Impeachment proceedings will drag on for months and preoccupy
our nation to the detriment of ourselves and the world.
 &HT;    Our attention should be focused on a global economy that is
crumbling and could melt down and on a number of unstable military
situations, from Korea to India to Pakistan to Kosovo. Aside from
the alarming international scene, domestic problems such as health
care, social security and education must be solved.
 &HT;    Our nation, which has been a source of stability and good
throughout the world, cannot be leaderless at such a crucial time _
and yet we are.
 &HT;    President Gerald Ford's recommendation that Clinton be publicly
rebuked in the well of the House of Representatives is not the
answer. It would only further diminish Clinton's effectiveness at a
time when we need a strong, respected president _ not a man whose
reputation has been totally destroyed by an embarrassing public
rebuke on the House floor.
 &HT;    By now, Clinton has been reduced to attending political
fund-raisers and making endless phone calls to friends seeking
their advice on his pitiful personal crisis.
 &HT;    More than 180 newspapers have called for Clinton to resign. Many
have editorialized that his inexcusable actions in the Oval Office
threaten to seriously erode the integrity of the nation and damage
the standards, morals and ethics of our young people.
 &HT;    History teaches us that for any free society to survive and
thrive it must rest on a strong moral and ethical base. The issue
is not, ``Did he lie under oath?'' The issue is, ``Did he lie?''
And the answer is yes.
 &HT;    Clinton has taught our children to lie. Clinton has taught our
nation that a man does not have to be faithful to his wife and
family and can repeatedly devastate them by his irresponsible
actions. Clinton has taught our students in high school and college
that anything goes in their sexual behavior.
 &HT;    No wonder at least seven Boy Scouts in Utah who won Eagle awards
for observing the oath of honor and duty to God, country and self _
the highest commendation boys age 11 to 17 can earn _ refused their
certificates with Clinton's signature as honorary president of the
Boy Scouts of America.
 &HT;    Our children learn the words of our first president, George
Washington, who said, ``I cannot tell a lie.'' Two hundred years
later we have a president, Bill Clinton, who cannot tell the truth.
 &HT;    Any person who observes Clinton's behavior _ ranging from
intelligent to clever to wildly reckless and juvenile _ can only
conclude that he is emotionally unstable. And he shows a complete
inability to learn from the ill-chosen experiences of his youth,
from promiscuity to ``experimentation'' with drugs to evading the
draft.
 &HT;    Again and again, as a married adult, he has taken advantage of
women _ whether it's Gennifer Flowers, Paula Jones, Monica Lewinsky
or others whose names are not in the public record. He has earned
their disrespect and destroyed their lives. Any business executive,
high school principal or police chief who repeatedly lied and had
sex with an employee would be fired.
 &HT;    Why should we accept a lower standard from Clinton, who as
president is charged with life-and-death responsibilities?
 &HT;    Any member of the military who lies will be court-martialed,
without regard to whether he was under oath. Any military person
who is involved in sexual harassment or adultery will be
court-martialed.
 &HT;    Clinton, as commander in chief, surely must be held to these
same standards. He has the ability to order our precious sons and
daughters off to war to fight and die. Yet the motivation, wisdom
and rationality of his judgment are highly debatable in matters of
domestic and foreign policy.
 &HT;    Clinton has lied to the people he loves the most and he has
repeatedly devastated them _ his immediate family and closest
colleagues and friends _ and yet the pattern persists. He is
willing to inflict serious long-term damage on the Democratic
Party, our nation and millions of people throughout the world just
to stay in power.
 &HT;    As a young man campaigning for Congress in Arkansas in 1974,
Clinton repeatedly included references to President Richard Nixon's
predicament. ``I think it's plain that (Nixon) should resign and
spare the country the agony of this impeachment and removal
proceeding,'' Clinton said, according to the Arkansas Democrat on
Aug. 6, 1974. ``There's not any point now in (Nixon) putting the
country through an impeachment since he isn't making any pretense
of innocence now,'' Clinton said, according to the Little Rock
Gazette on Aug. 8, 1974.
 &HT;    After making these demands on Nixon, why doesn't Clinton hold
himself to the same standard of accountability and resign?
 &HT;    Clinton doesn't understand duty, honor, country or faith,
courage, service or truth _ and honor beyond all. He certainly does
not understand the Navy's ethic: ``When principle is involved, be
deaf to expediency.''
 &HT;    We cannot take the privileges and freedom we have in this great
nation for granted. We, the people, must be the guardians at the
gate.

<P>
   The government charges that Microsoft has leveraged its Windows
operating system monopoly into new markets by outbidding the
competition for third-party takeovers, by taking over the
competition directly, by giving away products the competition
sought to sell for a profit, and by hiring away the competition's
best minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than competing legitimately and on the merits,
Microsoft has resorted to predatory and anticompetitive agreements
and conduct,'' the prosecutors wrote in a pre-trial summary of the
case.
</P>
<P>
   On an NBC news special about Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates that
aired in 1995, the company's president, Steve Ballmer, voiced the
firm's take-no-prisoners approach toward its rivals _ an approach
the prosecution plans to highlight in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys can be taken,'' Ballmer said. ``'But the only way
we're going to take them is by studying them. Know what they know.
Do what they do. Watch them, watch them, watch them. Look for every
angle. Stay on their shoulders. Clone them. Take every one of their
good ideas and make it one of our good ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's brief cites a comment by Ruthann Quindlen, a
Silicon Valley venture capitalist who helped take Microsoft public
in 1986. After learning of the areas that Microsoft regards as
off-limits to other innovators, she noted at a recent investment
forum: ``I guess that leaves us washing machines or toasters.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Justice brought its case in May, the appeals court
found that U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson had
erred in an earlier related case that revolved around Windows 95.
In that case, the higher court said Jackson should not have
second-guessed Microsoft's decision to bundle its Internet Explorer
browser within Windows.
</P>
<P>
   With that ruling in mind, the prosecutors restructured their
brief away from the firm's alleged mistreatment of Netscape
Communications Corp. to allege _ based on an 1890 statute _ that
Microsoft had engaged in a broad series of illegal acts to protect
its Windows monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Each side is limited to 14 witnesses in the case, which is
expected to last eight weeks. The government plans to call key
players at Apple Computer Co., America Online Inc., IBM, Intel
Corp., Intuit Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. The star witness for
the prosecution, however, will be James Barksdale, president and
chairman of Netscape, Microsoft's longstanding rival in the browser
wars.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's briefs, however, argue that it was Netscape's poor
strategic policies that have caused its recent fiscal woes. With
the case virtually certain to be appealed clear to the Supreme
Court, the defense team will seek to establish a factual record
that Microsoft had never sought to persuade Netscape to ``divide
the market'' for Web browsing software.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the 12 initial defense witnesses are key Microsoft
employees. Before the trial concludes, Jackson, who will try the
case without a jury, will hear testimony from two further defense
witnesses whose identities have not been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft does not plan to call Gates. But videotaped pretrial
testimony by the firm's co-founder and the world's richest man will
likely be injected into the trial.
</P>
<P>
   John Rose, a senior vice president and group general manager for
</P>
<P>
   enterprise computing at Compaq, will also testify on behalf of
the software giant. Houston-based Compaq is known in the trade as
an OEM, or original equipment manufacturer, and it sells units
pre-loaded with Microsoft's browser, initially programmed to pop up
as the users' first screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's curious that the government hasn't called an OEM
if they think OEMs have been unduly harmed and influenced,'' said
Jonathan Zuck, executive director of the Association for
Competitive Technology in Washington. The association, an advocacy
group of about 200 computer-related companies, argues that the
computer industry is best left unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, however, want Microsoft to grant OEM's unfettered
control of what should appear on a buyer's first screen. They also
want Microsoft to sever its exclusionary contracts with Internet
content and service providers.
</P>
<P>
   At a midweek meeting of key Microsoft purchasers in Orlando,
Gates said the case has had little effect on his company so far.
``There's no change in what we are doing in terms of the focus _
the product design or any of that _ that has been brought about by
that matter,'' Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   And he predicted that his company's aggressive business
practices would survive the antitrust scrutiny. ``We are very
confident _ particularly with the clear criteria that the appeals
court has laid down (in an earlier case) _ that that kind of
innovation is a great thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Which side prevails in this stage of the legal battle may rest
on how Jackson weighs Microsoft's intent.
</P>
<P>
   What motivated Microsoft to incorporate its Internet Explorer
browser into the Windows 95 operating system, and Windows 98, its
successor? Were these true business decisions, rooted in the notion
that the firm's customers sought an integrated product? Or were
they aimed at harming Netscape?
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers recognize that, under the antitrust laws, the same set
of actions could be deemed legal or illegal, depending on
underlying motives.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, current Windows code, used in 97 per cent of
personal computers currently being shipped, is so tightly
interwoven with the browser that the operating system would fail if
they were to be pulled apart.
</P>
<P>
   So software engineers recognize that any adverse legal outcome
for Microsoft would not easily lend itself to a quick fix _ short
of spinning Windows off into a regulated digital utility, a drastic
remedy that the government has so far rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it hard to believe you can have a case where a company
is found to have violated the law, but there's nothing you can do
about it,'' says Robert Bork, a former federal appeals' court judge
who serves as a consultant to Netscape for the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Microsoft wins this case,'' says William Kovacic of George
Mason University Law School, ``you're going to see a major retreat
in the Justice Department's willingness to bring future antitrust
cases.''
</P>
<P>
   In the run-up to the trial, the government has argued that,
should it prevail, Microsoft could be forced to include the
Netscape browser in Windows. But Kovacic believes that even such an
outcome would, in the end, serve only to further bolster Microsoft.
``It will be seen as delivering magic beans for the cow,'' he
concluded.

 &HT;    TESTS SHOW CHINA HAS REIMPOSED CENSORSHIP ON CNN WEB SITE
 &HT;    EDs: Contains optional trims.

 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ There are signs that Chinese censors have once again
set up electronic barriers aimed at blocking 1 million internet
users in China from accessing the CNN and British Broadcasting
Company Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman of China's ruling State Council declined Friday to
answer a written query on why average netsurfers in Beijing no
longer could dial up the CNN Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an easy question to handle,'' explained an official
in the State Council's information office, which had considered the
query for two working days.
</P>
<P>
   During the glow of openness before and during President
Clinton's visit this summer, China already had moved to pare down
its list of about 100 foreign Internet sites that Chinese
authorities made inaccessible in 1996 because of their alleged
political or pornographic content.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sites that were unblocked over the intervening months
were those of CNN and the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, the BBC disclosed that China's main
state-controlled Internet service provider ChinaNet was ``believed
to be blocking access'' to major portions of its London-based news
site.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the BBC said, Web surfers in China were unable to
access the BBC's new Web-based Mandarin language broadcast and
transcript service. However, it said some BBC English language news
reports remained unaffected.
</P>
<P>
   CNN has made no similar disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   But systematic tests by the Cox News Service Asia Bureau in
Beijing over the last 10 days have found that it was no longer
possible to reach the main CNN Web site -- CNN Interactive
(http://www.CNN.com) --through a direct connection with China's
Internet. At the same time, other pages of the CNN Web site dealing
with sports and financial news are accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Reached in Atlanta, CNN Interactive editor-in-chief Scott
Woelfel said, ``We know the Chinese government has limited access
to our site from time to time over the past few years. We oppose
this action and urge the People's Republic to allow its citizens
free and unfettered access to the Internet at all times. . . . No
government should restrict its people from knowing and
understanding world events as portrayed by CNN.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no convincing explanation of why China apparently has
now chosen again to cut off two of the world's most widely viewed
news Web sites. The action comes at a time when Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji is stimulating the growth of the Internet in China, and his
subordinates are allowing scores of other foreign news Web sites to
offer news from inside China and around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   At the office of one of China's major Internet providers, an
employee speculated that the CNN site probably had been ``banned''
by the security authorities because it was deemed ``against the
Chinese government.'' But this could not be confirmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the apparent blockage of the CNN site, William
Palmer, spokesman at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, would comment
only obliquely. ``The United States believes that the free flow of
information is essential to an informed citizenry,'' he said, ``and
to a nation's political, economic and social development.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   Like the Cold War jamming of short wave news broadcasts 50 years
ago, China's 1990s blockade of electronic news remains far from
air-tight.
</P>
<P>
   The latest round of Internet censorship seems effective enough
to limit the viewing habits of the broad majority of China's casual
Web surfers.
</P>
<P>
   But the new measures have not turned out to be much of an
impediment for China's growing minority of net-savvy aficionados,
who delight in exchanging custom software settings for detouring
around the censors.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   Western experts believe that China's Internet censors are
headquartered inside the sprawling security compound just east of
Tiananmen Square that is China's equivalent of FBI headquarters.
The censors are said to work for the Computer Administration
Department, an affiliate of the Public Security Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, some employees at Chinese computer networks have told
Western diplomats that, approximately every two weeks, they receive
visits from Chinese security agents who bring them updated lists of
Web sites to be blocked.
</P>
<P>
   To carry out these directives, the network controllers
reportedly set up computer databases of blocked sites. Then,
electronic ``filtering'' software automatically consults these
databases to identify and block all communications to and from any
Web sites on the list of banned sites.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   Along with impediments to the CNN and BBC Web sites, tests this
week indicated that longtime blockages continue against the news
Web sites affiliated with The New York Times and Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   However, many other foreign news sites are not blocked inside
China. As of this week, Chinese surfers could freely browse the net
affiliates of The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, The
Boston Globe, Time Magazine, CBS, NBC, ABC, MSNBC and Fox News.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox News Service tests involved repeated attempts over the
last 10 days to access news Web sites through the Cox News Service
Asia Bureau's computers. Spot checks also were made on two other
Beijing computers that accessed the Internet through two separate
Chinese Internet networks.

   At the office of one of China's major Internet providers, an
employee speculated that the CNN site probably had been ``banned''
by the security authorities because it was deemed ``against the
Chinese government.'' But this could not be confirmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the apparent blockage of the CNN site, William
Palmer, spokesman at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, would comment
only obliquely. ``The United States believes that the free flow of
information is essential to an informed citizenry,'' he said, ``and
to a nation's political, economic and social development.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   Like the Cold War jamming of short wave news broadcasts 50 years
ago, China's 1990s blockade of electronic news remains far from
air-tight.
</P>
<P>
   The latest round of Internet censorship seems effective enough
to limit the viewing habits of the broad majority of China's casual
Web surfers.
</P>
<P>
   But the new measures have not turned out to be much of an
impediment for China's growing minority of net-savvy aficionados,
who delight in exchanging custom software settings for detouring
around the censors.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   Western experts believe that China's Internet censors are
headquartered inside the sprawling security compound just east of
Tiananmen Square that is China's equivalent of FBI headquarters.
The censors are said to work for the Computer Administration
Department, an affiliate of the Public Security Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, some employees at Chinese computer networks have told
Western diplomats that, approximately every two weeks, they receive
visits from Chinese security agents who bring them updated lists of
Web sites to be blocked.
</P>
<P>
   To carry out these directives, the network controllers
reportedly set up computer databases of blocked sites. Then,
electronic ``filtering'' software automatically consults these
databases to identify and block all communications to and from any
Web sites on the list of banned sites.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   Along with impediments to the CNN and BBC Web sites, tests this
week indicated that longtime blockages continue against the news
Web sites affiliated with The New York Times and Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   However, many other foreign news sites are not blocked inside
China. As of this week, Chinese surfers could freely browse the net
affiliates of The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, The
Boston Globe, Time Magazine, CBS, NBC, ABC, MSNBC and Fox News.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox News Service tests involved repeated attempts over the
last 10 days to access news Web sites through the Cox News Service
Asia Bureau's computers. Spot checks also were made on two other
Beijing computers that accessed the Internet through two separate
Chinese Internet networks.

POLL SHOWS LIBERAL DEMOCRAT LOSING GROUND IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a race so tight it may not be decided until
the last votes are counted, a survey released Friday shows Sen.
Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., losing by a razor-thin margin to state
Treasurer Matt Fong.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, commissioned by the San Francisco Examiner KTVU-TV,
shows that for the first time in the campaign more voters view
Boxer negatively than positively. Political analysts say that could
be an electoral kiss of death for the liberal incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the voters are saying is, they don't like you
personally,'' said Del Ali of Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research
of Columbia, Md., which conducted the poll.
</P>
<P>
   Ali said there was little chance voters would change their view
on Boxer, who served in the House before her election to the Senate
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But the poll showed a race still too close to call. Fong, a
Republican, was favored among likely voters 46 percent to 44
percent _ a statistical dead heat because of the poll's margin of
error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Ten percent of those
surveyed were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also showed that Boxer is favored by more women. The
gender gap, however, was much less pronounced than Boxer's 1992
campaign, when 60 percent of women voters cast ballots for her.
</P>
<P>
   Fong and Boxer were running neck-and-neck in the Los Angeles
metro area, a traditional Democratic stronghold. Boxer remains
strong in the liberal San Francisco Bay area, but Fong led in the
Central Valley, the San Diego area and Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Despite two debates and increasing media coverage of the race,
one-third of voters still have no opinion about Fong. Still, the
poll shows Fong has the support of 81 percent of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll of 820 registered California voters was
conducted Oct. 11-13. All who were questioned said they regularly
vote in state elections.
</P>

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Democratic political consultant Gale Kaufman said the numbers,
while not encouraging for Boxer, did not signal the race was over.
She said Fong's rise in support was the result of Republicans
finally lining up behind the lesser-known candidate before the Nov.
3 election.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a traditional hardening of positions before the
election,'' Kaufman said. ``I don't think this is the end of the
world. As in any race, the critical weeks are now.''
</P>
<P>
   But the poll shows the momentum belongs to Fong.
</P>
<P>
   In an Examiner poll in February, Boxer had a nine-point edge in
a match against Fong. By May, it was a five-point edge. By July, a
three-point lead. The last poll, taken in September, showed the
race tied. The new poll marks the first time Fong has moved ahead.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, political observers have described the election as
less a battle with Fong than a referendum on Boxer. Indeed, the
poll cast doubts on Boxer's popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-three percent of those surveyed had an unfavorable opinion
of her, while 42 percent viewed her favorably.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Crigler, director of the Jesse Unruh School of Politics at
the University of Southern California, said Boxer's unfavorable
rating is the result of several factors, including her advertising
campaign that attacks Fong.
</P>
<P>
   ``For one, the race is coming closer to conclusion and people
are making up their minds'' about the candidates, Crigler said.
``Also, she's seen as in the Clinton camp and that may be rubbing
off on her. And part of it is that she's running negative ads. When
people run negative ads, their negatives also go up with their
opponents'.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong, however, has avoided attack ads and has promoted a
moderate image.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Fong has needed to do is to wake up, smile, shake hands
with people and say as little as possible,'' said Allan Hoffenblum,
a Republican political consultant in Los Angeles. ``The results are
paying off very nicely.''

ONE CRIME, TWO BROKEN AND RUINED 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 18) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.A. DYER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   The names in this story have been changed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Conner was 9 years old, an insecure kid with dyslexia, when
a teacher offered him the most powerful words in the English
language: I love you.
</P>
<P>
   Then he reached for the boy's crotch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `Stop, it's nasty,' '' recalled the boy. ``Mr. O
said, `Oh, come on' and just kept doing it. I just thought he is an
older person, and I have to do what he says.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan was sexually assaulted by 59-year-old Richard O'Leary over
the course of several months in 1989 and 1990. Eventually, the
teacher confessed to the crime and was given a 10-year probationary
sentence. As part of that, O'Leary underwent years of therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, Ryan Conner remains horribly scarred: He
believes the assaults affected his views on sex, women and
authority figures. And he says that justice has not been done, that
O'Leary deserved long imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, O'Leary expresses tortured remorse for his
crimes, but says counseling has taught him self-control. He says
his punishment was correct. Never again, O'Leary insists, will he
harm another child.
</P>
<P>
   This crime, and tens of thousands like it, raise tough,
emotional questions. Should neighbors be alerted when a sex
offender moves next door? Should offenders be kept in jail for as
long as possible? Is the answer therapy, as O'Leary believes?
</P>
<P>
   The story of Conner and O'Leary _ the story of one crime, but
two damaged people _ can provide a human reference point for those
who consider such questions. For any answer carries a human toll:
for the pubic, for the abused, even for the offender.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1986, O'Leary began work at one of Houston's more
popular private elementary schools, where he taught science,
history and physical education. It was there _ during the early
part of the 1989 school year, probably during a climbing-wall class
_ that he met and became fixated on Conner.
</P>
<P>
   On the evening of March 12, 1991, about a year after O'Leary
left the school, three patrol officers came to his door, read him
his rights and led him away in handcuffs. He was panicked and
sobbing. The charges: two counts of aggravated sexual assault of a
minor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked, scared, crying, humiliated,'' O'Leary recalled.
``I don't know, I was just so afraid. But there was also this sense
of relief, like this is going to trigger an end to all this, one
way or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   After his arrest, O'Leary confessed to assaulting Conner, to
similarly abusing another boy years earlier and to acting
inappropriately with 11 other children since puberty. But the
statute of limitations had expired on these other acts, so O'Leary
was prosecuted only in Conner's case.
</P>
<P>
   The strictest sex offender registration and notification laws
would not have prevented these assaults, and O'Leary may never have
been arrested if Conner had not alerted his mother. The admission
came Feb. 25, 1991, a year after the assaults ended, in his
mother's car, as she drove Conner home from his therapist's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that he didn't want to tell me since I would probably
cry,'' recalled his mother. ``(Conner) had numerous nightmares that
night, waking me about every 15 to 30 minutes to tell me that he
was dreaming that Mr. (O'Leary) was going to kill him.''
</P>
<P>
   Through therapy, O'Leary says he has gained a better
understanding of his sexual compulsions. He described some of those
conclusions, and much of his life story, during hours of interviews
at his home in one of Houston's upscale enclave cities.
</P>
<P>
   Through most of it, O'Leary sat in an easy chair, his legs
crossed at the ankles. He generally spoke in soft, even tones _
except on a few occasions when he wept, or on another occasion,
when his voice rose perceptibly after acknowledging a contradiction
in his account.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary is thin, but not too tall, and walks with a shuffling
grace. With his graying hair, long face and soft voice, he reminds
one of television's Mr. Rogers. He speaks easily, rarely fumbling
with words, even at awkward moments.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary graduated from Rice University in Houston in 1953 with a
degree in philosophy and later received a theology degree from New
York's Union Theological Seminary, one of the country's best. He is
an ordained minister and worked as a minister and youth director at
two Methodist churches for the first 15 years of his career. Later,
he worked at various private schools in the Houston area.
</P>
<P>
   He is married and has four adult children (none say they were
ever victimized by their father) and six grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary said he agreed to tell his story to show that he and
others like him are not necessarily monsters.
</P>
<P>
   He can look a person in the eye, and without turning away, say,
``I'm a child molester.'' What may be even more difficult for
people to hear is this: Richard O'Leary also says he's a human
being.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my mother and father met and married, my father had just
gotten out of World War I,'' O'Leary began, choosing his words
carefully. ``But he told her he had a serious war injury and that
they could not have any sexual contact until the injury was
corrected.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary's father, however, had lied. There was no war injury.
Instead, he had syphilis, presumably contracted overseas. Although
O'Leary's mother did not divorce her husband, she nonetheless was
repulsed by him. And O'Leary's father, who eventually was cured of
syphilis, remained sexually frustrated throughout the marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so that was the home I was born into,'' said O'Leary,
recounting a story told to him by his mother shortly before her
death. ``I remember violent fights, a cold aloof woman _ repulsed
by her husband _ and those terrifying fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember going to bed at night and hearing them fight
and hearing her wail and cry and remembering hearing that he was
throwing stuff across the room _ probably at her. We were
terrified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, my father's anger and frustration would focus on my
brother and I. We got whipped by his hand, by his belt, and we got
kicked. I remember getting kicked _ that was probably the worst
punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary also said his mother could not console him _ ``There
were never any hugs and kisses'' _ and that the only love he
received was from his brother, Raymond. About a year his senior,
Raymond also was terrified by their father's frightful rages.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there was this one time I felt my father loved me,'' said
O'Leary.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was about 5 years old, playfully wrestling with his
father. But as they rolled around on the bed _ laughing happily _
the play turned sexual, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a clue what was going on,'' said O'Leary. ``I
couldn't compare his behavior with any other sexual behavior,
because I didn't have any other sexual behavior to compare it with.
I didn't think it was abnormal behavior, because I didn't know what
normal was.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in my mind, I linked a man playing with a little boy _
being sexual with a little boy _ with a man loving a little boy. It
was so much better than being kicked and demeaned and whipped and
beaten with a belt. I thought my dad was loving me.''
</P>
<P>
   After that single incident _ for O'Leary recalled no other
sexual encounter with his father _ he began to ``act out sexually''
with his brother. As the family couldn't afford a big house, the
two brothers slept in the same room, in the same bed. That's where
it happened, night after night, for about five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I loved my brother, and that's the way you show
love: sexually,'' said O'Leary. ``I never forgot those sexual
experiences I had with my father and my brother. But somehow or the
other, I didn't link that with pedophile tendencies. It's odd in
retrospect.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Conner doesn't buy it. O'Leary's whole story about the
brother _ the one who witnessed this abuse first-hand, the one with
whom O'Leary supposedly engaged in incest for five years _ where is
he now? Conveniently dead. O'Leary's older brother can neither
confirm nor dispute the story because he was killed in a hunting
accident about 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And what does O'Leary's other brother _ a younger sibling still
living in Texas _ have to say? In a sworn affidavit, he says he
knows nothing of O'Leary's early childhood because he was born
seven years after his brother.
</P>
<P>
   To Conner, O'Leary is an intelligent and well-spoken con man.
How else to explain the high regard to which he was held by parents
and teachers? How else to explain the probationary sentence? And,
especially, how else to explain O'Leary's popularity with all the
little boys at the school, the boys who idolized O'Leary?
</P>
<P>
   To them, said Conner, Mr. O'Leary was like a god.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. O in that school was the man,'' he said. ``He always did
stuff that boys liked, like he would make explosions happen and he
showed us how to climb rocks. But (he wasn't popular) with the
girls so much, because the girls didn't care about seeing something
explode on the table when you mixed two chemicals together.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would even bad-mouth the girls, in front of the guys. He
would try to make himself seem like one of the guys and would try
to keep the girls away, saying this was a `guys only' lesson. Or
he'd say, `We're going to be blowing things up here, and you can't
be around.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Conner is grown now: 18 years old, ruddy good looks, thin but
athletic. He works outdoors as a boat mechanic and so has grease
beneath his nails and hair that has gone blonde from the sun. For a
youth with so many problems _ he said that he hardly left his house
for years after the sexual assaults _ Conner speaks with
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The dyslexia that keeps him from writing clearly has not
prevented him from gaining a command of language. He can succinctly
describe his violent attacks on a classmate, or punching his fist
through a window pane, or becoming sick with anxiety upon being
called to testify against O'Leary.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks of it all with lively twang, with drawn-out Texas
vowels and ``yeps'' and ``uh huhs,'' and with a bit of profanity
here and there.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one elementary school, I remember that I had a female
teacher that tried to make me do my work, and so I'd pick up
furniture _ you know, the little chairs _ and I'd throw them around
the room,'' he said, recalling the months after the assaults. ``And
at recess, if anybody tried to do anything to me, like try to take
the ball away from me, I'd end up pounding their face into the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I was doing all this stuff on auto-pilot. I didn't know why I
was doing it, I just knew that I was angry. I remember being really
mad at everything, being really mad at everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Conner now attributes that anger, as well as many of his
prejudices and phobias, to O'Leary. For instance, Conner said that
O'Leary often spoke poorly of other teachers, Conner's mother
(O'Leary supposedly said she was stupid) and women in general. For
many years afterward, Conner shared those views.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, I had this weird idea that females were just
useless things and that's what (O'Leary) had instilled in me,''
Conner said. ``He gave me the impression that women were good for
one thing and one thing only (sex), and the rest of the time they
could just be locked up in the closet. You'd just pull them out
once in awhile, do your things to them, and then put them back in
the closet.''
</P>
<P>
   Conner failed the fourth grade three times, was expelled from
various schools, and for years after the assault was terrified of
removing his clothes or using public bathrooms. Even taking a bath
would sometimes prompt panic attacks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Conner thinks back _ as he remembers the lies and the
manipulation and as he remembers O'Leary's big con _ the anger
returns. But Conner is an adult now, and he has words for his
feelings. This is what he now says about Richard O'Leary: ``I hate
him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When it snapped in my head that he was a sick, perverted wacko
_ you know, after a bunch of therapy _ and after I sat around and
thought about what the hell he was doing, and how it was totally
not normal, and how he totally violated me and other people, well,
I just didn't want to just kill him. I wanted to torture him first.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now, you know, I don't want to kill him and I don't want
to torture him. I'd still kind of like to go kick his ass a little
bit _ but I don't want to kill him. You know, I believe that
everybody has their place in this world, even if they're really
sick and twisted and disgusting. I believe they should have a
chance to make themselves better.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the alternative was years in prison, O'Leary said
deferred adjudication _ the sort of probation he received, the sort
of probation that leaves no record of conviction _ has been quite
strict.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, O'Leary is subject to the state's notification
and registration laws: He must go to police headquarters once a
year to have his photo taken and must provide his address and other
personal information to authorities every three months. Much of
that information is available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   He said the process is stressful and that if the state
institutes more restrictive notification and registration rules, he
may move when his probation ends in three years. O'Leary also said
that in his case, the public notification requirements are somewhat
irrelevant, as he already informed his friends and neighbors of the
sexual assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, as a requirement of his probation, O'Leary must attend
therapy. If he misses sessions or fails to cooperate with his
therapist, he could face a long prison sentence, which he believes
would only leave him further damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's good punishment because it covers such a long
period of time and because there are a lot of restrictions _ like
travel restrictions and constant monitoring and lie detector
tests,'' said O'Leary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This also allows a person to get their own rehabilitation, to
seek very good help and to pay for it. None of my rehabilitation
has been at taxpayers' expense, and it has cost me over $30,000. I
think that's good. I don't think the taxpayers should pay for the
rehabilitation.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the origins of his own compulsions were always a
mystery. But thanks to his weekly sessions at the Baylor College of
Medicine's Sexual Abuse Treatment Program, O'Leary believes that
he's finally gained an understanding of his compulsions and how to
avoid situations that could trigger them.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary said that, perhaps every seven years or so, he would
find himself sexually attracted to a young boy. He said those boys
were always between the ages of 5 and 10 and were always children
he knew well, children with whom he had developed a rapport over
several months. He said he has had contact with more than 150,000
children in the course of his 30-year career, but made an emotional
connection with only a small number.
</P>
<P>
   What drove that, said O'Leary, was a sense that his victims were
experiencing troubled childhoods similar to his own. O'Leary said
his two victims expressed longing for their fathers' affection _ as
O'Leary had as a young child _ as well as a sense that their
mothers were in some ways emotionally absent, generally because
they were obliged to work long hours.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Leary described another trigger _ a sense that the child
already has been sexually molested by someone else. He described
the resulting compulsion not just in sexual terms, but in emotional
ones: It was as if he became jealous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like this other guy had loved him, and I knew that I
loved him,'' said O'Leary, describing his feelings upon hearing
that his victims already had been sexually assaulted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a completely deranged, sick thinking that I couldn't
explain. And when I would become aware that I had sexual feelings
for children _ whenever that awareness came about _ it was
humiliating and degrading. It was the low point in my life. I felt
horrible, strange, different from other people. I felt alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The first case _ an assault that occurred about 20 years ago _
involved a boy whose parents were divorced. The boy ``loved his
father and missed his father and wanted his father's love and
respect ... and so my heart went out to the kid,'' O'Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then, one day, we were together, and he was talking to me,
and he started relating to me about this high school kid that
molested him ... and BANG _ I knew I had to do the same thing to
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't happen immediately, but in my mind the stage was set
and the die was cast. I felt like I had to love that little boy
like I was loved by my father. I thought, `I do love him.' You
know, I felt so close to him, and I was empathetic for him, and so
I had to express my love for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the sick feeling in my head.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary said he repeated the same behavior 10 years later, when
he established an emotional connection with Conner. Again, he said,
the sexual assaults began only after Conner spoke of being molested
by someone else.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Ryan Conner said he was never molested by anyone
other than Richard O'Leary. Conner acknowledged that he once told
O'Leary of being sexually assaulted by his mother's ex-boyfriend,
but insisted that story was a lie. Conner said he never liked the
ex-boyfriend and probably lied to hurt him. Or maybe he made up the
story because he thought that was what O'Leary wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a little kid, you tell weird things to weird people,''
said Conner.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, Conner said, O'Leary had been acting indecently
months before hearing the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was, like, showing me his penis, and touching me through my
clothes and stuff like that,'' said Conner. ``But, yeah, when I
told him (of being sexually assaulted), that was when he started
getting very into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Conner recalled that he first met the teacher in an after-school
program, during a climbing-wall class that O'Leary organized.
There, said Conner, the teacher would touch him through his
clothing while fitting him with a climbing harness. Conner, who
said the inappropriate touching began from almost the first day of
the class, assumed that O'Leary touched other children.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary then started grabbing the boy's genitals during games of
flag football, said Conner. According to the youth, O'Leary told
the children that such touching was normal among adult football
players.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, O'Leary would expose his genitals to Conner or
attempt to fondle the boy in his office, behind a locked door.
Conner also said O'Leary began speaking graphically about sex _ and
encouraged the 9-year-old to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Conner recalled one such occasion when the two were alone in the
school's Chevrolet Suburban, as O'Leary was driving to drop off
various recyclable materials from the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how it came up,'' said Conner. ``I was just there
and we were talking about how much money we were going to get on
the recyclables, and then it would jump into what women did wrong,
and women were good for only one thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it was bizarre. I didn't get it. He talked about one of
my teachers that way _ that she was just a whore, and that he bet
she was good in bed, that he bet she was noisy.''
</P>
<P>
   Conner said O'Leary's compulsion continued to escalate, until he
would perform oral sex and other sex acts on the boy. O'Leary also
asked the boy to perform such acts on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the time that all this was going on, Mr. O was
constantly calling my house,'' Conner stated in a court affidavit.
``After my mom told him to stay away from me, he started sending me
letters and cards. He gave me toys and money, too. When Mr. O would
call me on the phone, he would say sexual things about what he was
going to do to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The court record indicates that several of the assaults occurred
during overnight camping trips or at hotels. Conner said that on
one such trip, Mr. O'Leary wanted to sleep alone with him in the
hotel bed. In another, O'Leary took revealing photographs of him
with a Polaroid camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was sick about the whole thing was that it was like you
were his lover or something,'' said Conner. ``And then you'd be
with him for about a year, and you got too old for him and he'd get
bored with you. I remember one time he even said, `I don't think we
should see each other anymore.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Conner recalled on one occasion, he joined O'Leary and his wife
for a day at the beach. Although O'Leary did not behave
inappropriately during the excursion, Conner wondered why O'Leary's
wife never suspected the truth. How could she be so blind?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' said Conner, ``I was over at their house a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his arrest, O'Leary and his wife had been married
about 30 years. For much of that time, they resided in the same
house with the same neighbors. They raised four kids.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. O'Leary, who also asked that her real name not be used,
said in all that time, she suspected something was amiss only once.
It was years and years before O'Leary's arrest, after she found
some photographs _ including nude photographs _ of one of O'Leary's
young students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I confronted (my husband) when I first saw them, and he
explained that the boy had been molested by one of his neighbors,
and that he (her husband) had been shocked and horrified,''
O'Leary's wife said, haltingly.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, she said, claimed that the photos helped the child
explain, physically, how the molestation took place. But instead of
turning the photos over to the police, O'Leary burned them. It was
then that she insisted her husband see a psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the psychiatrist said to me, point blank, `Can't you
handle that your husband has a mistress?' '' said Mrs. O'Leary,
explaining that the psychiatrist misinterpreted her husband's
behavior as signs of an affair. ``In those days, they didn't really
understand sexual addiction.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
(MORE) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And what of the strong bonds her husband would sometimes form
with prepubescent boys? What about Conner's visits to the house, or
the attention her husband sometimes lavished on other children _
often to the exclusion of his own? She witnessed all that behavior,
but insists she never suspected her husband was a pedophile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that (my husband) had a strange upbringing _ I knew how
his parents were cold and indifferent with him, and I knew that his
father had a very volatile personality,'' she said. ``And I knew
that he was very, very close to his brother, Raymond. My
interpretation of things was that he just related better to
children because the best relationship in his life was with his
brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the other thing was that this didn't go on all the time.
He had thousands of relationships with kids that were healthy. And
it never happened in front of me. It's like you have a picture of
reality, about what your life is all about _ and then this happens.
I just never dreamed that anything like this was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Conner's mother also was fooled by the teacher. Her
son was dyslexic and she perceived O'Leary's attention as that of a
concerned teacher. But as the months wore on, she began to see
O'Leary's attention as a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, she told the school of her concerns. It was then,
according to court documents, that school officials acknowledged
that they also had noted O'Leary's unusual attention to the boy and
already had attempted to separate the two. School officials told
Conner's mother that they had opened an internal investigation into
O'Leary and found that former employers at other private schools
had expressed similar concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Conner's mother demanded that O'Leary cease all contact with her
son. School officials agreed, and the following year declined to
renew his contract _ citing differences in educational
philosophies.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Conner said nothing about the assaults, although he
expressed dismay that his mother had separated him from O'Leary. He
also continued to display increasingly bizarre behavior. Conner's
mother recalled how the child refused to remove his baseball cap,
denim jacket and pants, even in bed. Sometimes he would even wear
several layers of clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would tear things up for no reason; he was very
destructive,'' she recalled. ``I found pictures of (my son) where
he had stabbed through himself with knives and things. He would
sometimes go into fits of crying, and he would ask me to spank him,
for no reason. He'd say, `I'm a bad kid, I'm a bad kid.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In desperation, his mother sent young Ryan to a therapist. It
was after one such session, as he and his mother were driving home,
that the boy finally told his mother the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``What made me tell was the therapy,'' recalled Conner. ``I
finally thought this was stupid, and I'll just go ahead and tell
her. This was like two years after it had gone on.''
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't Conner speak out earlier? Conner said there probably
are several reasons. For one, Conner said, O'Leary was able to
manipulate his dwindling self-esteem. Because of his dyslexia,
Conner was already having difficulties in school and he said being
singled out by O'Leary _ ``a god'' among the boys there _ made him
feel special.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, O'Leary would repeatedly tell Conner that what they
were doing wasn't wrong, although others wouldn't understand it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like I was being brainwashed _ thinking that it's all
normal, and it's all in guy fun, and this was what was cool,''
recalled Conner. ``He was, like, `You know, if your dad was around,
he would be doing this, and so I'll do it for you, because I feel
like your dad.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Conner also said O'Leary used his position to make him feel
guilty about the activity and warned Conner that if his mother
found out, she probably would abandon him.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the simplest reason for maintaining his silence,
said Conner, was that O'Leary told him to.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Don't tell' and said, `If you do tell, bad things
would happen,' '' recalled Conner. ``He said it all the time. He
said it a lot. I got the impression that (if I told) he was going
to come and beat my door in, and beat me up, and kill my mom.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary claims to be a man on the mend _ a man who accepts the
reality of what he's done. ``Honesty,'' he said, ``is the only way
to deal with this.'' And yet one wonders.
</P>
<P>
   For instance his story in some regards did not match that of
Conner's, and on one occasion, O'Leary even contradicted himself.
While the former teacher repeatedly expressed remorse for his
attacks, he often seemed more upset about his own plight. At one
point, he began sobbing as he spoke of growing up in dysfunctional
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why bring an innocent child into that? I'm living proof of
what happens,'' he said, his tear-strewn face contorted with
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10 years into therapy, O'Leary continues to insist that
he never encouraged Conner to keep the sexual activity a secret. He
said he never told any of his victims to keep it a secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I didn't think I'd get in trouble,'' said O'Leary.
``My thinking was so screwed up in that area of my life, that I
didn't have the normal fears that normal people have.''
</P>
<P>
   But Conner said O'Leary told him, over and over, not to tell a
soul.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, O'Leary said he spent 30 years of his life working
with kids. Tens of thousands of kids. And yet, he said, he never
requested that work. He said supervisors at the various private
schools and churches would note that he related well with children
and would assign him those jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But later, O'Leary acknowledged that one after-school program he
operated was created at his suggestion. After hours of questioning,
he acknowledged that it probably wasn't pure happenstance that the
children eligible for that program were exactly of those ages that
he found sexually appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, after going through years of therapy, I can see my
problem figured into a lot of what I did,'' O'Leary conceded, his
voice rising in momentary annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary _ who said he was so remorseful that he considered
suicide _ voluntarily confessed to his various friends and
neighbors after his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   But was he prompted more by self-interest? His image was already
broadcast across every major Houston television station and in
major newspapers. And after telling acquaintances of the assaults _
and explaining ``his problem'' _ O'Leary requested that they submit
letters to the court on his behalf. It may have been those letters
that saved O'Leary from a long prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary insists he is working hard toward recovery _ and many
around him agree. His children, for instance, were among those who
wrote letters on his behalf. They spoke of a distant man who
perhaps never showed them enough love, but who didn't abuse them
either _ and how that man was changed by his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (now) is an open book and would tell us even more than we
are comfortable knowing about his problem,'' wrote one daughter in
a court document. ``He has immersed himself in treatment and is
doing everything he can to become whole and functioning again.
There is a stack of at least 25 books which sits next to his bed,
and when he is not in therapy, he is reading one of these.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first he seemed destroyed and he still has a lot of hard
days. But his determination never dies, and I have no doubt that
for the rest of his life, he will fight with all that he has to
break the cycle of abuse which he fell victim to and which he
continued by victimizing others.''
</P>
<P>
   Conner also has worked hard toward recovery. His challenges have
been many: Besides living with dyslexia, he has dealt with several
relocations, the divorce of his mother and with his hatred for at
least one of her boyfriends. At 18, after repeated arguments with
his mother, Conner left home. He now shares a house with his
girlfriend _ his very first _ and her family.
</P>
<P>
   He said his former teacher damaged him in a way that seems
permanent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ruined my life!'' the young man blurted out in a moment of
anger.
</P>
<P>
   But Conner is a youth of keen intelligence _ his knowledge of
computers, for instance, is nothing short of astounding. Despite
O'Leary's assaults, Conner believes his own future is bright. He
said he wants to open his own business, maybe rent boats and teach
water skiing.
</P>
<P>
   If O'Leary didn't ruin his life, it was only because Conner
wouldn't let him. He said he no longer is a defenseless boy. Now
he's strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, you know, I would have liked to have had friends in high
school and go to parties and games and all the stuff normal high
school kids do,'' he said. ``So I can't sit here and imagine that
it never happened. It's all part of my life now.'' &QL;

 &HT;    'EMERGENCY' LABEL PROVIDES A WAY AROUND BUDGET CAPS
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The coming of the year 2000 is hardly unexpected,
but money to fix the computer Millennium Bug is one of several
``emergency'' expenses totaling $20 billion in the new federal
budget agreement between the White House and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   And while it has been known for months that U.S. troops in
Bosnia would require funds, since they have been there since 1995
and have no departure date, the spending accord puts $1.9 billion
for their operations in the same ``emergency'' package.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, once Congress and the president agree that a
program is an emergency, ordinary spending limits don't apply. But
this year's expansion of the category has some experts warning of a
breakdown in the fiscal discipline that helped deliver the first
budget surplus in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passes supplemental spending bills every year, but the
most recent version is almost quadruple the size of last year's.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the computer and Bosnia provisions, the emergency
package includes $7 billion that Republicans added for military
readiness and anti-missile defense, plus $1.8 billion to strengthen
security at U.S. embassies abroad and $6 billion in disaster aid
for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost everything in this emergency bill fits the definition
of 'We couldn't afford it in the regular bill so we're doing it
this way,' `` said Martha Phillips, executive director of the
Concord Coalition, a non-partisan group that urges budget
restraint.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said, Congress added more military spending
because they had overstuffed the regular Pentagon budget with pet
projects such as weapons built in their districts. ``Then you don't
have money for the basic bread and butter, meat and potato stuff
you have to do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Phillips argued that the federal government routinely
fails to plan for disasters such as the current farm crisis by
setting aside an adequate contingency fund.
</P>
<P>
   Charles L. Schultze, an economist at Washington's Brookings
Institution who was an adviser in the Carter administration,
concurred. ``They're fudging the concept of emergency,'' he said.
``It's bad budgeting and it's a way to get around the budget
limits.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's emergency package is the largest since 1991 and
1992, when Congress paid the bills for the Persian Gulf war. Since
then, spending in this category has been relatively modest, with
the exception of the $13 billion bill in 1994, when the country was
hit by several natural disasters, including the Los Angeles
earthquake, Hurricane Andrew and Midwest flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency appropriations in recent years include $5.5 billion
for fiscal 1998, $9.2 billion for 1997, $5 billion for 1996 and
$7.7 billion for 1995.

EDUCATION BECOMES LEAD ISSUE FOR TEXAS POLITICIANS 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 18) 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ With Texas' crime rate down and voters not yet
concerned about the economy, candidates in this year's statewide
election are running like it's a contest for local school board.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats alike in the contests for governor,
lieutenant governor, comptroller and land commissioner have
emphasized their role in obtaining educational excellence in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has ranged from property tax relief to classroom
construction; from teacher pay raises to audits of public schools;
from private school vouchers to state-paid college scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   The debate in the governor's race between incumbent Republican
George W. Bush and Democratic challenger Garry Mauro has focused
mostly on education spending.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush wants to spend more, he also wants to deliver a $2
billion school property tax cut. Mauro wants to take advantage of
the state's good economy to bring teacher pay up to the national
average, and he wants to take a 30-year, $2 billion loan from the
state's education trust fund for school renovation and classroom
construction.
</P>
<P>
   In the contest to replace retiring Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, the
campaign fire has been over using tax dollars for private school
vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rick Perry supports a voucher test program for
children in low-performing public schools. Democratic John Sharp
has not ruled out such a program, but he accuses Perry of actually
seeking a full-scale voucher program for all children as a way of
repaying his financial backers.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for state comptroller, Republican Carole Rylander is
borrowing a page from Sharp's successful 1990 campaign by
describing herself as an ``education watchdog'' who will audit
school districts. Sharp has conducted financial audits of numerous
districts, including Houston and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic comptroller candidate Paul Hobby wants to use half
the state's lottery money for incentive bonuses for schools that
improve their education performance. Both candidates support
teacher pay raises.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas land commissioner manages state mineral leases to
raise money for public education, which has opened the door for
Democrat Richard Raymond and Republican David Dewhurst to debate a
wide range of education issues that have little connection to the
land office. But both promise to improve education by raising more
money for it.
</P>
<P>
   All four candidates for governor and lieutenant governor appear
to be moving in the same general direction toward creating a
college scholarship program for Texas students.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp originally made the issue a cornerstone of his campaign
when he announced for lieutenant governor last year, but Mauro
quickly moved to back it. And last week Bush and Perry both
described it as ``an interesting idea,'' with Perry predicting some
form of a scholarship program will pass the Legislature next year.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp's proposal is based on a program called Hope Scholars
adopted by Georgia. Sharp calls his plan Lone Star Scholars and
proposes having the state pay for the tuition, fees and books of
any Texas student who maintains a B average in college. This would
include the state's private universities and technical schools as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``What that has done in Georgia ... is it has completely changed
the dynamics in the first grade classes,'' Sharp said.
</P>
<P>
   ``First graders who weren't talking about college because their
parents weren't sure they could foot this bill 10 or 12 years from
now suddenly they're all wearing Georgia and Georgia Tech T-shirts
and they're talking about college.''
</P>
<P>
   The program would cost about $485 million a year, but Sharp says
that could be paid for with half the state's lottery income or
about half the budget cuts he plans to propose to the Legislature
next year. Sharp said the economic payback to Texas would be
enormous.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you doubled the price of oil today, that would bring in
$16.5 billion (to the state's economy) over the next five years,''
Sharp said. ``If you increase your college graduates by 5 percent,
it brings in $26 billion over the next five years. That is the
difference between what a high school graduate makes and a college
graduate makes.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans last year greeted Sharp's program cautiously,
calling it a new ``entitlement'' program. Sharp said college is no
more of an entitlement to future generations than a high school
diploma was for his father's generation.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spoke favorably of the plan last week and said he has not
endorsed it because he has other education spending priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't taken a position on it yet because I want to make
sure my budget is sound and whole,'' Bush said, but noted: ``It
deserves debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry said he does not want to give Sharp credit for an idea
conceived in Georgia, but he predicted some form of the program
likely will pass the Legislature next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be some technical changes that we would want to see,
raising the standards,'' Perry said. ``We will see some type of
substantial scholarship program debated and most likely passed.''
</P>
<P>
   When the debate turns to secondary education, there is far less
harmony.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has established the primary Republican position on public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I set the most profound goal that I'll probably ever set as
governor, and that is: Every single child should be reading and
comprehending at grade level by the third grade and remain at
appropriate grade level throughout their entire public school
career,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has promised to end the practice of ``social promotion,''
the automatic promotion of students who cannot pass the Texas
Assessment of Academic Skills. Mauro has complained that the
decision should be based on teacher assessments, not a standardized
test.
</P>
<P>
   If the program had been in place last year, about 250,000
students would have been held back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad news is we've got many children who need help,'' Bush
said. ``My fear is if we don't do something about it, we will be
passing illiterate children through the system.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under Bush's plan, students who fail the test would be given
remedial after-school and summer school help and be given a second
chance to pass the test. A major portion of his budget proposal
goes to a reading initiative to prepare students for when the
social promotion program takes effect in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wants to give $2 billion of the state surplus to public
school districts so they can cut their local property taxes by a
like amount. Bush also wants to give districts $1 billion they can
spend as they please on classroom instruction.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants to spend $203 million on the reading initiative
linked to his social promotion plan; $166 million for textbooks;
and $25 million for after-school programs in neighborhoods where
the children are at risk of dropping out or joining gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he also wants to spend $200 million on school facility
construction. He said by paying the interest and principal on
school bonds, that money can be leveraged into about $3 billion in
school construction.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro argues that Bush's budget plan is missing a golden
opportunity to make up for shortcomings in the state's education
finance system. He says budget surpluses can be used to improve the
system.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro said that in 1984, the state committed to improve
education by reducing class size to 22 students for every teacher;
bringing teacher pay to the national average; and holding schools
accountable for educational excellence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then because money ran out, we spent the next 10 years, the
next 15 years talking only about accountability,'' Mauro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stopped doing anything at the state level to do anything
about class size and we gave minimal pay raises. So we're right
back to where we started in 1984.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro wants the state to borrow $2 billion from the Permanent
School Fund to pay for public school construction and renovation.
At present, only interest earnings from the education trust fund
can be used.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has called Mauro's plan a ``raid'' on the state's education
trust, but Mauro proposes passing a constitutional amendment to
borrow from the body of the fund and then repay it with principal
and interest over 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro said Bush's school construction plan does not come close
to his because Bush is wrong about what costs are covered in the
school facility construction program. Mauro said it just pays for
the interest on school construction bonds and thus finances far
less construction than Bush claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he (Bush) knows what he's talking about because
the current program only pays interest,'' Mauro said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Texas Education Agency rules for the program
clearly shows Bush is correct _ ``debt service shall include
payments of principal and interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro also proposes giving public school teachers a $6,000 a
year pay raise, and a $5,000 signing bonus for college graduates
who commit to teaching in public schools for three years.
</P>
<P>
   He said the average Texas teacher pay right now is about $32,000
a year while the national average is about $38,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our teachers aren't being paid enough and now we're having a
teacher shortage,'' Mauro said.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro said Bush's plan does not guarantee teacher pay raises by
leaving that decision up to local school districts.
</P>
<P>
   In the lieutenant governor's race, Perry supports most of Bush's
initiatives. But he also is pushing his own plan for master reading
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers under Perry's plan would take specialized courses on
the teaching of reading. Once they had passed a skills test, they
would be eligible for a $5,000 a year increase in pay, with another
$2,000 if they agreed to teach in a low-performing public school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense to us to very quickly, as soon as we can, to do
the same thing for math teachers, science teachers, social science
teachers and other teachers,'' Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp has promoted a plan to increase state funding to public
schools by about $1.4 billion over the next two years to ease the
burden that the so-called Robin Hood school finance plan places on
wealthy school districts. The plan also would trigger a pay raise
for most teachers.
</P>
<P>
   But Sharp and Perry have clashed over vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Perry is pushing a plan to adopt a pilot project to give
students in low-performing schools a voucher that they can use to
transfer to another public school, a private school or a religious
school.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp says Perry has received more than $300,000 in campaign
money from people who want a full-scale, $2 billion-a-year voucher
program and that he is using the pilot as a first step.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp said public schools should be forced to accept students
from low-performing schools and those low-performing schools should
pay for the student's transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about a pilot project. This is about a bunch of
folks who want to get into the private school business, people in
state and out who want to get into the for-profit school
business,'' Sharp said.
</P>
<P>
   ``John claims a lot of things about Rick Perry that are not
true,'' Perry replied.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said the competition of private school vouchers will force
districts to improve low-performing schools. If not, then it gives
the students an option for getting out.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are children who don't have a choice. Their parents
can't send them to another school,'' Perry said. &QL;

 &HT;    IN KOSOVO, THE TOLL IS SHOWING ON THE CHILDREN
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ International aid workers are expressing
grave concern about the thousands of children, particularly babies,
among Kosovo's ethnic Albanian refugees displaced by months of
fighting here.
</P>
<P>
   Children examined by health workers are showing signs of decline
because of malnutrition, diarrhea and respiratory infections,
conditions likely to worsen when cold weather comes, doctors and
aid workers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things don't change, my feeling is that there will be a
high rate of morbidity and mortality among children,'' said Paula
Silverman, an American pediatrician who is in the preliminary
stages of assessing the needs of children for aid groups.
</P>
<P>
   In visits to refugees this week, Silverman said many children
have little or no access to the kind of consistent medical care
needed to keep these problems from becoming life-threatening. She
expressed particular concern about dehydration, a by-product of
diarrhea that can be fatal if not treated properly. ``These
children need access to get some rehydration solution very soon,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Months of village-to-village fighting between the ethnic
Albanian Kosovar separatists and Serb military and police forces
have forced thousands of civilians from their homes. Many houses
were leveled or severely damaged in the fighting, and an estimated
50,000 refugees remain outside as the temperatures drop.
</P>
<P>
   Since estimates of the number of refugees vary from 250,000 to
more than 450,000, there also is uncertainty about the number of
small children among the refugees. Relief agencies estimate the
number of children a year old and younger to be at least 15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at Kinderberg, a German relief group that specializes in
caring for children, are particularly concerned about new mothers
who cease breastfeeding because of the extremely stressful
circumstances. The women lose their milk quickly, creating a
potential crisis for babies because of poor access to baby formula
or cow's milk, said Bajram Maxhuni, a doctor working with
Kinderberg.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the scarcity of medical facilities, pregnant women
are delivering babies in the open or in unsanitary conditions
without disinfectants or even clean water, said Maxhuni, who added
that many of the newborns die. Their mothers get serious infections
from the deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   Education also is a concern. While the studies of many children
have been suspended, others drift in to classrooms in schools that
remain open. In the refugee community of 1,800 near the village of
Kisnareka, refugees have erected a makeshift school built largely
of plastic sheeting. The school has two classrooms for 30 children,
who sit on logs for two hours of lessons each day.
</P>
<P>
   After an interruption in aid deliveries of several days caused
by the uncertainty over NATO airstrikes, relief trucks have been
rolling to isolated villages and other places where people
displaced by the fighting have congregated. The convoys, organized
by the Pristina office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees,
are targeting priority areas each day, carrying basic food,
medical, shelter and other supplies. Convoys destined for two
villages are scheduled for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers stress that they believe the refugees would be
better off returning to their homes, even if they were severely
damaged in the fighting. But refugees express reluctance to return
home because they fear Serb police and military forces who remain
in the area. Additionally, they are unnerved by the occasional
gunfire and shelling that continues in the countryside despite the
U.S.-brokered peace deal, which averted the NATO airstrikes in
exchange for a Serb police pullback and end to violence in the
Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   These fears also are keeping them from seeking medical care in
field clinics being provided by aid groups. ``The reality is that
they will have no access to medical care if they are not willing to
go get it,'' Silverman said.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers also worry about the psychological damage inflicted
on children. ``We are seeing a lot of trauma with what they have
been through,'' said Iliriana Loxha of Kinderberg. ``These problems
will last a lifetime.''

   FIELDS-RICHARD (Undated) _ On Wednesday night, a double-A list
of the friends and clients of Bertram Fields gathered at the ``21''
Club to offer congratulations. Another legal victory for the
swashbuckling Hollywood attorney? Not exactly. This time, Fields,
who has done legal battle on behalf of Tom Cruise, James Cameron,
the Beatles and nearly every major film studio, was being feted for
a scholarly book in defense of an altogether different client,
Richard III. By Andrew Jacobs.

   ROLEX-ENVY (Undated) _ Rolex is the main noun in the
international language of success. By Stephan Talty.
</P>
<P>
   GRACE-SLICK (New York) _ Somehow the Palm Court at the Plaza
Hotel, with its harpist and doilied dessert plates, seems like the
last place where Grace Slick would want to meet. But here she
comes, dressed mostly in black, looking startlingly like herself
even though the Feed Your Head Queen of Jefferson Airplane, the
voice that launched a thousand trips with her 1960's anthem ``White
Rabbit,'' turns 60 next year. Judging from how good she looks,
either she took far fewer drugs than anyone imagined, or the
cosmetics industry should start marketing an LSD eye cream. By Alex
Witchel.
</P>
<P>
   GLAM-ROCK (New York) _ Gabe Doppelt was scrambling. As VH-1's
creative director of fashion, Ms. Doppelt co-produces the cable
music channel's annual Fashion Awards, and each year she
commissions designers to create outfits for the show's opening,
purportedly around a rock-related theme. But, she admits, ``Every
year I look for the appropriate collision of fashion and music, and
I never really find it.'' This year promised to be no different,
until Ms. Doppelt heard that a movie about the glam rock movement
had won an award at the Cannes film festival, and her antennae
began buzzing. By David Handelman.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ Some worthy plants are victims of
gardeners' prejudice, among them marigolds because of their scent,
goldenrod because it resembles ragweed and gladioluses because they
are so often the flower of choice at funerals. By Cass Petersen.

<P>
   SHERIDAN, N.Y. _ Ransom Lydell guessed right 17 years ago when
he thought there would be a booming market for the lily-like
perennials called hostas. But spotting an opportunity is one thing
and exploiting it is another, as millions of failed entrepreneurs
have discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Today Lydell, 59, runs one of the most successful hosta
businesses in the country, mostly because he has figured out how to
differentiate himself from his rivals in flower-selling.
</P>
<P>
   If you happened into the Corner Snack Bar here around noon on a
recent weekday and witnessed him in his trademark pith helmet,
digging into a plate of flapjacks and trading gossip with the other
regulars, you would probably not have picked him out as a marketing
genius.
</P>
<P>
   But appearances can be deceiving. When he had his brainstorm in
1981, Lydell knew a thing or two about flowers. As the owner of a
small landscaping business, he understood that outdoor floral
displays could work magic on consumers' wallets. And, as a graduate
of the state Agricultural and Technical Institute at Alfred, he
realized that hostas, unlike roses and other popular flowers, were
nearly virgin territory for the creation of new varieties through
hybridization.
</P>
<P>
   Today his Eagle Bay Hosta Gardens, a three-acre sanctuary of
bridges, ponds, arbor and faded red barn, contains 800 hosta
varieties and 15,000 plants. Outsiders can meander freely around it
anytime they happen to be passing through this hamlet in the grape
country of Chautauqua County, near Lake Erie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredibly important for people to see how the flowers
they're buying will eventually look,'' he said. And on any day
during the growing season, the enthusiasts wander in, video cameras
in hand. Some are from as far away as Europe or Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In his research operation, Lydell has 1,000 hybrids ``under
observation'' _ monitoring them over six or seven years for flower
color, form, height, uniqueness of the leaf pattern and resistance
to slugs, a scourge of hostas.
</P>
<P>
   Once satisfied, he ships the hybrid off to the University of
Minnesota, home of the worldwide hosta registry. If his variety is
accepted, he can sell the first 100 plants, the flower world's
equivalent of first-issue postage stamps, for a total of $1,500 to
$10,000. His record sale for a single plant was $350.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Lydell has registered some 18 varieties. He calls his
most recent creation Saybrook Surprise and his favorite, which
resembles a yucca plant, Yucca Ducka Do.
</P>
<P>
   On the sales side, he is determined not to be outdone by the big
mail-order flower merchants. He has his own Internet site
(http://vinetime.com/eaglebaygardens/index.html) chock-full of
hosta news and, of course, order forms. But since gardeners can be
technophobes, he continues to publish his color catalog and accept
orders by phone, fax and plain old snail mail.
</P>
<P>
   Sales have doubled every year in the last four years. Profits
are up, too, enabling Lydell to buy his dream vacation home on Lake
Erie not long ago.
</P>
<P>
   His second pith helmet is almost worn out, but Lydell has no
plans to retire. ``You've got to be kidding me _ my youngest girl
wants to go to medical school,'' he said. He is expanding his
flower park with picnic tables, public restrooms, a gazebo, a
miniature tropical garden, an Alpine forest and a Japanese
teahouse.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the hosta business is not without its intrigue.
``There's a master plant thief who works out of New York City,''
Lydell whispered conspiratorially. ``He's stolen plants from the
emperor's gardens in Japan. It's like any other field where
beautiful objects can sell for several thousand dollars _ serious
collectors can get desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Lydell's biggest problem with theft does not involve
people. Last summer, some local deer became fond of feeding on his
best hosta, a $3,000 variety. He tried everything to drive them off
until he discovered that there was one thing they couldn't abide:
country-and-western music on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deer loved classical and soft rock _ it made them eat even
faster,'' he says. ``I finally found an upscale country station,
which they absolutely hate. Now they have to go to the Corner Snack
Bar, just like the rest of us.''

<P>
   JACUMBA, Calif. _ There's an old photograph from the 1930s
hanging in Felix Bachmeier's dark hotel lobby that offers a glimpse
of what this tiny hamlet was like in its glory days.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fading shot of Jacumba's main street, crowded with dozens
of highly polished touring cars parked in front of a large,
rambling hotel. The artesian springs used to make this high desert
town east of San Diego a popular weekend and vacation spot, before
air conditioning and the development of Palm Springs lured the
tourists away.
</P>
<P>
   But when the the locals talk wistfully about the good old days,
they don't mean the 1930s. They're talking about a couple of years
ago, before a highly publicized border crackdown drove a wedge
between Jacumba and Jacume _ its tiny sister city across the
Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   The grand, old hotel burned down years ago, and Jacumba's
population is only about 400 now. Many of the little town's
residents live here because they seem to prefer the beauty and
isolation of the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Jacume and Jacumba are close to nothing but each other. You can
stand on the U.S. town's main street and see the rooftops of its
neighboring community across a narrow valley. If Jacumba is small,
Jacume is even more humble _ a settlement populated by descendants
of Mexican workers who built the aqueduct between Tecate and
Mexicali, and then simply stayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old stagecoach used to run through here and over to
Mexico,'' mused George Bellon, a U.S. citizen who keeps about 50
head of cattle at his weekend place in Jacume. ``These two areas
have been sister cities since time immemorial.''
</P>
<P>
   The residents of Jacume would cross to go to church in Jacumba,
or to pick up mail (there's no postal service in the Mexican town).
The residents of Jacumba would cross to visit friends and family in
Jacume. The border was just a worn spot in the landscape, marked by
a battered old wire fence that the locals pretty much ignored.
</P>
<P>
   But then came the border crackdown known as ``Operation
Gatekeeper.'' The major infusion of surveillance and manpower,
backed by a border fence, put the pressure on the 10-mile line just
south of San Diego, historically the busiest crossing point between
the United States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Border Patrol started putting the squeeze on San
Diego in 1994, the stream of illegal immigrants and drug smugglers
moved east into the Imperial Valley and began coming through Jacume
and Jacumba, sometimes at the rate of hundreds per night.
</P>
<P>
   You can still see the evidence of what hotelier Bachmeier refers
to as ``the wild days.'' At the traditional crossing spot between
the two towns, a makeshift taco stand sits abandoned _ testament to
the crowds of people who would use the clearing as a staging area,
waiting for dark before charging across the border in groups too
large for the original eight Jacumba-area Border Patrol agents to
handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That town was devastated by this,'' groused Jacumba resident
Bob Mitchell, nodding toward Jacume. ``It wasn't much more than a
church with a circuit priest and a cafe. When the coyotes and drug
smugglers came ... the whole town was traumatized by the presence
of mafioso.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Operation Gatekeeper'' eventually followed the illegal
immigrant traffic to Jacumba, and the region got a lot more Border
Patrol Agents _ raising the force to 30, then 73. And the crackdown
also brought the symbol the locals have come to hate _ a metal
fence along sections of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an ugly blight,'' Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of illegal immigrants and smugglers have moved
again, even further east, and things have been much quieter for the
last six months. But the Border Patrol still apprehends about 65
people a day along the 10-mile line which stretches through the two
small towns.
</P>
<P>
   And the rules have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Now a Border Patrol vehicle parks on the hill looking down at
the traditional crossing and U.S. citizens are frequently stopped
and warned that they are not supposed to cross. The local Border
Patrol supervisory agent says they don't have the manpower to haul
every scofflaw American to San Diego for processing. &QL; 
 &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the stakes are higher for their Mexican counterparts. Both
Jacume residents and Mexican nationals who live legally in Jacumba
are stopped and told they must make a long drive to cross at either
the Tecate or Mexicali port of entry or face possible revocation of
their residency or work status.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Tuesday afternoon, a Border Patrol agent wached
from a nearby hill as San Diego estate planner Jim Westbrook's wife
dropped him off. He stepped over the fence, only slightly more than
knee-high there (to block vehicular traffic), and walked to the
Humvee he had parked on the Mexico side. He climbed in, and made
the short, albeit rough, drive up the hill to his weekend house in
Jacume.
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol agent would wave him down as he came back
across to the U.S. side about an hour later, reminding him that he
was not supposed to cross there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not opposed to the Border Patrol,'' Westbrook said.
``But when the (Mexican) people from Jacumba and Jacume go across,
they're going to see families _ they're not running north.''
</P>
<P>
   Westbrook and his wife got a couple hundred signatures on a
petition to U.S. Sen. Diane Feinstein in May, asking if there was
not some remedy available for their community. Feinstein's office
responded that there was nothing she could do, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So people like Mario Ramirez are stymied. He lives in Jacume
with his wife and two children, but has worked, legally, for nearly
a decade in Bachmeier's small hotel. In the old days, Ramirez would
get up and come across the border to work.
</P>
<P>
   But now, he's forced to drive 2 { hours out of his way, west to
Tecate, through the legal border crossing there, then back east to
Jacumba. He's pursuing American citizenship and says he can't risk
losing it by getting caught crossing illegally, no matter how
inconvenient the drive is.
</P>
<P>
   So he stays in Jacumba at least three days a week, then takes a
couple days off and drives the long way home to spend a couple of
days with his family, then makes the long drive back and works for
about three more days.``
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible, but we don't have no choice,'' Ramirez said.
</P>
<P>
   And Ramirez isn't the only one who thinks the commute is
ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I crossed through Tecate, an officer was asking
me, `Where are you going?''' Ramirez said. ``I said, `To Jacumba. I
have a job there.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Where are you coming from?' I said from Jacume. And
he said, `Jacume? Why don't you go through there?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The border officer suggested that what Ramirez and his neighbors
need is a small, pedestrian border crossing like the kind found in
several towns in Arizona and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, the local people on either side would vouch for
the honesty of the (crossings),'' Bachmeier said. ``Like, someone
comes with me to my place, you don't have to worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Lukeville, Ariz., the pedestrian border crossing is only open
about eight hours a day, an Immigration and Naturalization
spokeswoman said. It's staffed by either an INS agent and a customs
agent who rotate the duty, said spokeswoman Eileen Schmidt.
</P>
<P>
   But any new port of entry, no matter how small, has to be
approved by Congress, and there's no legislation pending that would
help the residents of Jacumba and Jacume. A spokesman for U.S. Rep.
Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., who represents Jacumba, said the
congressman is sympathetic to the problem, but that creating any
new port of entry is a function of economics.
</P>
<P>
   Bachmeier says he's lost some business from Mexican citizens as
a result of the crackdown, but what he grieves is the division of
his community.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like myself go (to Jacume) for a baptism, go for a
wedding,'' Bachmeier said. ``They have a cemetery over there _ we
even buried an American friend of ours in Mexico. When you think of
that, it hurts a little bit, you know?'' &QL;

 By ADAM BRYANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Recent survey by a women's research group found that
the boards of directors of 71 companies among the Fortune 500 were
made up entirely of men.
</P>
<P>
   To those who have followed the results of such annual surveys by
Catalyst, a nonprofit organization in New York, the news
undoubtedly sounded familiar. After all, Catalyst has been saying
for years that the percentage of women at the upper echelons of
Corporate America remains small, though it is growing slowly: women
hold 11.1 percent of the seats on Fortune 500 boards, up from 10.6
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fact that roughly 14 percent of the 500 largest
companies do not have a single woman as a director raises a simple
question: Why?
</P>
<P>
   The answers, according to more than 20 companies asked by The
New York Times why they lacked a woman director, ranged from ``no
comment'' to statements that they were searching for woman
directors to explanations that they consider ability alone, and not
gender, race or age, when seeking new directors.
</P>
<P>
   Quantum Corp., a disk-drive maker based in Milpitas, Calif., for
example, said it would like to add a woman to its board, and that
over the last five years, it has attempted ``targeted searches''
for female directors without success.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem may be Quantum's criteria: chairman and
chief executive Michael Brown said its highest-priority requirement
for board candidates was operating experience at the chief
executive level at a company with $6 billion or more in annual
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, not many women fit that profile. But then, neither does
anyone else on Quantum's current board, aside from its current
chief executive and two former Quantum senior executives. (That,
company officials said, is why Quantum has this priority _ to
broaden the collective experience of the board.)
</P>
<P>
   Quantum's desire for a top-level executive with significant
operating experience, which is shared by many other companies, is
an important reason there are so few women on boards of large
companies, said Dennis Carey, vice chairman for the U.S. practice
of Spencer Stuart, an executive search firm that recruits directors
for about 250 boards a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``A significant percentage of them would love to consider
bringing females on the board,'' Carey said. ``When you begin the
process, you start with a very small pool that meet the criteria.
But if you loosen the criteria, and look at executives responsible
for significant functional areas, the supply issue begins to
fade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a supply problem,'' Carey added. ``It is a
criteria problem at the end of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies, however, have no women as directors for a lot of
reasons, most of which Sheila Wellington, president of Catalyst,
has heard before. For example, she said, many companies say their
board searches are not based on gender.
</P>
<P>
   But the gender-neutral approach, Ms. Wellington said, ignores
the fact that women represent 46 percent of the work force, make
the majority of consumer decisions and can bring some different and
valuable perspectives to a table otherwise encircled by men, even
if the women are not chief executives or senior vice presidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that there aren't women that can add value to the
work of corporate board is implausible at best,'' Ms. Wellington
said. She added that one chief executive wrote in a 1995
confidential Catalyst survey: ``It's easy for boards to get
club-like and ingrown. The notion of a bunch of old men who grew up
in the same environment governing a company _ it's the best formula
I know of for getting out of step in a changing world.''
</P>
<P>
   The most thoughtful argument for not worrying about the
relatively small number of women at the highest reaches of
corporations, Ms. Wellington said, is that demographics alone will
right the imbalance over time. As more women rise through the
ranks, the reasoning goes, the candidate pool will inevitably grow.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, she said, is that Catalyst has consistently found a
statistically significant link between the presence of women on
corporate boards and in senior executive ranks: at companies where
you find one, you tend to find the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if there is a cause and effect,'' she said.
``But the phenomena appear to reinforce each other. If there isn't
a commitment to make it happen on all fronts, it's not going to
happen on any front.''
</P>
<P>
   Catalyst estimated that at the current rate at which women are
being added to the ranks of corporate boards, it will take another
66 years before boards are populated equally by men and women.

PRELUDES: FINDING THE RIGHT INVESTMENT MANAGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 18)  
 (bl)  
 By ABBY ELLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a year, Edward Lecomte listened to an incessant stream of
talk about ``the market.'' Friends boasted about booming stock
portfolios, his sister made a bundle in a mutual fund and
colleagues badgered him to jump on the bandwagon. So last winter,
Lecomte, 37, decided it was time to become a player.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't work in finance _ he runs a school in New York that
teaches English as a second language _ and he had no financial
expertise. So he made an appointment with Fidelity Investments,
expecting to walk out with a clear understanding of the markets and
a plan for building a nest egg. He was sorely disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They speak a language I don't comprehend,'' he said. ``I told
the guy that I didn't get it, but at a given point, you start
feeling silly because it seems like it should be obvious. So you go
away thinking you should have asked more questions, but you didn't
because you were intimidated.'' He fled Fidelity without investing
a dime.
</P>
<P>
   Then Lecomte went to the discount-brokerage firm Charles Schwab,
thinking he would open an account and manage it himself, online,
learning as he went. Alas, he left more frustrated than ever and
still with no account. ``There, it was a feeling that I was with
the riffraff, the small investors,'' he said, ``whereas at Fidelity
I felt like a top gun _ you didn't understand them, but at least
you didn't wait around for 20 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   As Lecomte has discovered, choosing the person who will take
charge of thousands of your hard-earned dollars and for all you
know play roulette with your life savings _ can be daunting for
neophytes. Horror stories abound about annoying phone calls, failed
investments and less-than-savory characters. And then, of course,
there's the jargon: high risk, low risk, buying long, selling
short. But the search for a stockbroker, even in times of market
turmoil, doesn't have to be unpleasant; in fact, done right, it can
be a bit like looking for romance. You shop around, ask questions
and play the field before settling down. Or better yet, you have
friends set you up.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should be with someone you feel is intelligent and
understands your financial needs and personality,'' said Ed
Freiberg, 28, an associate producer for Chrysalis Sports, a
television production company in Manhattan. He has had a brokerage
account since he was in college. ``If you're not aggressive and you
don't want someone to be aggressive with your money, you need to
make sure his style is compatible with yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicky Landin, 34, a television director in Los Angeles, agrees,
but adds that one need not always defer to the broker's judgment.
She said she once entrusted her decisions to a a broker who talked
her out of investing in a stock that shot up by $14 soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to say, `You do it for me,' but you have to do your
homework,'' Ms. Landin said. ``I found that out the hard way.''
</P>
<P>
   Such tough-mindedness can come in handy when a broker pitches
what he says is the hottest stock since Microsoft, when he really
has a commission on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reputations of being like lawyers, and there are
unethical people out there,'' conceded Angeline Garcia, a Wall
Street trader. ``I'd look for someone who says, `There are risks,
and I'll probably be able to make you some money _ but I might
not.' I appreciate honesty.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Bobby Harrell, a Manhattan lighting designer, sees it,
the only thing better than feeling comfortable with one stockbroker
is feeling comfortable with two. For the last eight years, he has
built up a friendly relationship with a broker at the firm now
known as Morgan Stanley Dean Witter who he believes has his best
interest at heart. ``I call up, ask a question, and within seconds
he has information at his fingertips. I feel like he's interested
in me and is not in it for the money,'' Harrell said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, when he got a cold call a few years ago from a broker
at Merrill Lynch, he was impressed enough with the man's financial
savvy to hand over a chunk of his savings. ``Everything he does is
for the company; he probably has their logo tattooed on his
chest,'' said Harrell, 36. ``But I was solicited by him and I
wanted diversity, so I gave him about $3,000 to buy mutual funds.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Lecomte, who beat a hasty retreat from both Fidelity and
Charles Schwab, he's willing to try again _ someday. ``It's scary
right now, but I realize I should make an investment,'' he said.
``I hear about assembly-line workers who have a million dollars
because they invested in Coca-Cola 10 years ago, and I think, `I
could do that.'''
</P>
<P>
   He also has a suggestion for brokerage firms: ``What they should
do while you're sipping that awful coffee is give you a glossary of
the terms they're about to throw at you. Maybe then more people
would understand.''

   NORWALK, Conn. _ Not so long ago, Pepperidge Farm Goldfish were
swimming nowhere fast. The little cheese-flavored crackers were
popular among preschoolers and the bar-stool set, but they drew
scant interest from other demographic groups. Sales were flattish
year after year. Brand managers were content with what they had.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four or five years ago, everybody loved it, but nobody bought
it,'' said Patrick Callaghan, vice president for marketing at
Pepperidge Farm.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with the installation of new top management in 1995, the
company, a division of Campbell Soup Co., set out to breathe new
life into Goldfish and some of its other languishing baked goods,
like Milano cookies and Swirl bread. It poured money and people
into better marketing, pumped-up advertising, new packaging and
flavors and expanded distribution. The goal was to double
Pepperidge Farm sales by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The effort seems to be working. Sales have shot up for three
years running at rates of 10 percent or more, while the rest of the
cookie-and-cracker category has been anemic. ``For a food company
to grow at a double-digit rate without major pricing moves is
relatively extraordinary,'' said John McMillin, an analyst for
Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Now the question for Campbell is whether the smart management
that revived Pepperidge Farm can bring similar spice to the
company's flagship soup business.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperidge Farm, robust though it now is, accounted for only
$825 million of Campbell's $7.1 billion in sales last year. Sales
of soup in the United States, which generates half the company's
revenues, have long been just as lackluster as Pepperidge Farm was
before 1995.
</P>
<P>
   And while Campbell executives _ most of whom walk around with
red and white soup-can-shaped lapel pins emblazoned with the word
``Growth'' _ like to point to Pepperidge Farm as proof that skilled
management can reinvigorate stagnant brands, it is far from clear
that the tactics that turned Goldfish into a gold mine can do
anything for soup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pepperidge Farm has done a terrific job,'' said Nomi Ghez, the
food analyst for Goldman, Sachs, calling it ``a case of first-class
marketing.'' But it may be hard to pull off the same results with
soup, she added, noting that the category has grown just 1 percent
over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big difference between cookies and soup is that soup
already has very high household penetration,'' Ms. Ghez said.
``It's very hard to get people to buy more soup.''

   Goldfish, in contrast, remain a small part of the average
household's pantry inventory, with room to grow. Pepperidge Farm
has only 5 or 6 percent of the cracker market, and 3 percent of the
cookie market, she said. ``They're in a niche.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell chief executive Dale Morrison sees the company's soup
potential differently. Morrison was president of Pepperidge Farm as
the Goldfish reinvention got under way, and rode its success all
the way to the top job at Campbell in late 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are advantaged here relative to where we started in 1995
with Pepperidge, in terms of our scale and our brands,'' Morrison
said. ``The advantages we have with our market share and the
consumer connection to the Campbell brand will pay big dividends.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes, for example, that the familiarity will help convince
consumers that soup can also be a snack food. Earlier this year the
company introduced its first ``pourable,'' ready-to-eat tomato
soup, packaged not in an opaque can but in clear plastic in hopes
that people will see it when they swing open the refrigerator or
cupboard doors and think, ``Maybe I'll have soup.'' The company has
also come up with microwaveable single-serving soups and a
refrigerated soup called Stockpot. Its latest effort, known as Away
From Home, involves kiosks that serve soup in airports, cafeterias
and other places.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's soup business is growing in Canada, adding to the
chief executive's belief that there is growth potential in the U.S.
market. ``We're taking pages out of the Pepperidge Farm book and
pages out of the Canada book as we put together the formula for our
U.S. soup business,'' Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Pepperidge Farm's premium cookie lines _ Milanos,
Genevas, Sausalitos and their fancy siblings _ have been spared
much competition from private-label snacks. But private-label soups
have gained significant market share in the United States in recent
years, much of it at Campbell's expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Share gain is not the game when you are already the leader,''
said Jaine Mehring, a food analyst with Salomon Brothers, referring
to Campbell's soups. ``It's more about staving off share erosion
from private label, and dealing with a pricing umbrella that got a
little too high.''
</P>
<P>
   And other companies' innovations may have inadvertently helped
Pepperidge Farm. The successful introduction by RJR Nabisco of the
low-fat Snackwell's line three years ago led the cookie giants to
battle fiercely for a consumer who eventually defected back to
fatty cookies anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a bizarre way, Snackwell's got Keebler and Nabisco to focus
on low-fat products, and left Pepperidge Farm alone in the decadent
high end of the market,'' McMillin, of Prudential Securities, said.
``They became viewed as the providers of real taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison, who is known to lunch on, yes, tomato soup with
Goldfish sprinkled on top, said Pepperidge Farm was ``a little
complacent'' when he first arrived in 1995, fresh from running the
North American business of Pepsico's Frito-Lay unit. His plans for
freshening the division's marketing ruffled feathers, and some of
the executives he inherited took umbrage at the implication that
they had been too timid about tapping into Pepperidge Farm's brand
equity.

 NORWALK: brand equity.

   ``It's fair to say not everyone thought we were as bad as we
were made out to be,'' said Callaghan, a 20-year veteran, adding
that most of the people who did not agree with the plan left.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperidge Farm president David Albright said: ``At all
companies, there are firmly held beliefs about the business.
Sometimes those firmly held beliefs are right. Sometimes they're
dated. The answer is to go to the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   To beef up the marketing effort, Morrison created the marketing
vice presidency for Callaghan and brought in Geralyn Breig, a
marketing executive with Philip Morris' Kraft unit who had helped
resuscitate Jell-O, to oversee the Pepperidge Farm cookie and
cracker division.
</P>
<P>
   Out went much of the old nostalgia-centered Pepperidge Farm
marketing imagery, like the elderly fellow in a rowboat munching on
Goldfish. In galloped the new, like a smile stamped on the goldfish
shapes and packages as small as 1.5 ounces to go into lunch boxes
and vending machines. This year the Pepperidge Farm mill house logo
got a facelift, losing some of the snow on the roof and adding warm
yellow light in the windows, to make it look less frosty and more
welcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Money for increased advertising was freed up through
cost-cutting in the factories, an approach that became known within
Campbell as ``the enabler program.'' Many of the changes were small
but telling, like consolidating chocolate purchasing from six
suppliers to one. The company also ``changed the die on the
Goldfish, which gave us greater Goldfish density and allowed us to
reduce waste,'' Morrison said. And production was reorganized to
keep the factories, all of which are nonunion, busy around the
clock, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperidge Farm products are delivered to retailers through
independent distributors, each with an exclusive territory. The
distributors were renamed ``sales development associates'' and
encouraged to be as aggressive as possible in grabbing store shelf
space; the high profit margins on Pepperidge Farm products made
retailers willing to cooperate. Distributors were also encouraged
to expand beyond delis and supermarkets and into warehouse stores
and mass-merchandising outlets where they had not been sold before.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Pepperidge Farm will probably keep growing, though
perhaps not at the same blistering pace. But the jury is still out
on whether Morrison can transfer his Goldfish momentum to the soup
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a three-year phenomenon,'' Morrison said. ``It is
by no means over.''

JORDANIAN REPORTER HAS MISSION TO END FAMILY `HONOR KILLING' 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 18) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ Four years ago, a 16-year-old Jordanian girl
named Kifaya was tied to a chair and told to recite an Islamic
prayer. As neighbors listened to her plead for her life, her
brother slit her throat.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, bloody knife in hand, the brother went into the
street shouting that he had cleansed his family's honor of the
shame of Kifaya's ``immoral behavior``: Kifaya had been raped by
another brother and forced to get an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   When a crime reporter for the English-language Jordan Times went
to Amman's poor, crowded neighborhood of Hashemi Ashmali to find
out the details, the girl's uncles defended the killing and
suggested Kifaya had seduced her brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them that maybe the brother who had raped her should
have been killed,'' the reporter, Rana Husseini, recalled. ``They
thought about it for a second and then said `No, the right person
was killed.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The incident, hardly noted otherwise in the media, was a
watershed moment for Husseini, a Jordanian of Palestinian origin
who has worked Jordan's crime beat since 1993. ``This was when I
realized that our society tends to blame women for everything,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she has crusaded to keep a spotlight on an age-old
practice that is usually shrouded in secrecy. Jordanians call the
crime an honor killing. They occur when a woman is killed by a
relative for a real or imagined sexual transgression that might
tarnish the family's name.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever an honor killing occurred, Husseini, a 6-foot-tall,
athletically built 31-year-old, would appear at the scene wearing
jeans and tennis shoes in case she needed to escape angry relatives
and start asking questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women in this culture belong to their families,'' said
Husseini. ``If they do something wrong, it's as if they have
tarnished their whole family. I'm just trying to fight for their
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Her vigilance has paid off. Last May, Jordan's ministry of
social development announced plans to build the country's first
shelter for battered women, including those in danger of being
murdered by family members. The shelter would become home to some
50 women now held in prison for their own protection.
</P>
<P>
   She says she has received quiet encouragement from the royal
family. Earlier this year, she won the Reebok Award for Human
Rights for uncovering honor killings. Farah Daghistani, the
daughter of King Hussein's sister, nominated her; Queen Noor called
to congratulate her.
</P>
<P>
   The king, in 1994, described violence against women as a
``flagrant contradiction to our ongoing calls to preserve human
dignity and all human rights'' _ words widely interpreted as
directed against honor killings.
</P>
<P>
   But the royal family's opposition to the practice has not
changed traditional Jordanian notions of honor linked to the
virginity of a family's unmarried women.
</P>
<P>
   Royal opposition has not reduced the number of honor killings.
Every year, about 30 such slayings occur here. They account for
about one-third of all murders.
</P>
<P>
   And the king's words have not altered laws that seem to condone
honor killings by meting out light prison sentences to the
murderers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any man convicted of killing his female relatives for honor
reasons, the verdict will be reduced by half,'' said Asma Khader, a
human rights lawyer and former president of the Jordanian Women's
Union. ``Sometimes they get as little as six months or maybe one
year.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kifaya's case _ Husseini does not publish last names _ a
21-year-old brother raped her and then tried to kill her after she
told her parents that she was pregnant. Her family forced her to
undergo an abortion and then to marry a man 35 years her senior.
Six months later, the man divorced her. On the day of the divorce,
her 30-year-old brother killed her.
</P>
<P>
   The younger brother received 15 years for rape and attempted
murder. The older brother, her killer, got 15 years, but a court
cut the sentence to seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court views it as a crime of passion and makes excuses
because the woman has ruined the reputation of the family,'' said
Khader.
</P>
<P>
   Khader says these attitudes shape other areas of law dealing
with women, including inheritance, property rights and child
custody. In Jordan, a woman cannot get a passport or travel outside
the country without the consent of her ``wali,'' a husband or
closest male relative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `wali' decides everything,'' said Khader. ``It leads to
crazy situations. We have had female ministers and members of
Parliament, and they can't travel without the permission of their
`wali.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Khader and other Jordanian feminists have campaigned to change
the laws without success. In 1989, Husseini was part of a 60-person
team _ and one of four women _ appointed by the king to draft a new
National Charter. The document affirmed sexual equality, but it was
not legally binding.
</P>
<P>
   Khader says she does not expect a bill calling for stricter
sentencing for men who commit honor crimes, which she helped draft,
to be considered by the Parliament any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Even attempts to raise the legal age of marriage for women to 18
from 15 have met heavy resistance from traditional-minded members
of Parliament, most of whom are men. Of 40 members of the upper
house, only three are women. Among the 80 members of the lower
house, none are women.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, `We are an eastern, conservative society.' If we
encourage women this way, this will lead to breaking the unity of
the family,'' said Khader. ``They say, `We are different from the
foreigners, the Westerners. We don't want to import their values of
sexual freedom, which leads to AIDS and single motherhood.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Husseini, has weathered a barrage of criticism since she began
covering honor killings _ and not just from men. Once, an Arab
woman living in the United States called her newspaper to complain
that Husseini's stories were painting a negative picture of Arabs
in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Twice, while reporting on a story in Amman's poorer
neighborhoods, where most honor killings take place, Husseini fled
the scene because she felt unsafe around men who clearly viewed her
presence, and her Western dress, as an intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, she has been verbally attacked for dressing in
Western clothing, being single at an age considered old in her
culture and having studied at an American university.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think I'm doing this to encourage (premarital)
sex or to tarnish the image of our country,'' said Husseini, who
studied at
 &UR;  &LR; Oklahoma City University &UR;  &LR; for six years and received bachelors and
master's degrees in mass communications. ``It's not true. There is
something wrong and I just feel like it should be fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Husseini goes out of her way to stress that honor killings are
embedded in tradition, not religion. Christian Arabs, she says, as
well as Muslim may commit crimes of honor. And Arab culture is not
alone in honor killing. They also happen in Turkey, Pakistan and
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the criticism, Husseini continued to cover honor
killings, publishing an expos in The Jordan Times titled ``Murder
in the Name of Honor'' for which she received the an award.
</P>
<P>
   In four years, she has written about dozens of such cases. There
was the 31-year-old man who killed his 39-year-old aunt because she
often left the house without the knowledge of her family. There was
the court ruling reducing the sentence of a 22-year-old man who
killed his sister because ``the victim provoked the defendant by
telling him that she was free to do as she wished.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there was case of the 21-year-old man who murdered his
24-year-old sister and a man acquitted of raping her. The woman was
killed after she spent four years in protective prison custody. Her
family had signed a guarantee with the court vouching for her
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Husseini found that in many cases, the plea of ``honor killing''
was designed to cover up crimes of incest or rape. And she says she
found that innuendoes of sexual misconduct were often false.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court views the killers as victims also, victims of
circumstances,'' said Husseini. Over the years, she has come to
agree. ``Their families pushed them,'' she says. ``They say,
`You're responsible for the family honor.' They offer rewards, a
piece of land or to pay for a wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often they choose someone who is under 18 to do the killing so
that he will not have a record when he gets out of prison.''
</P>
<P>
   She hopes that her reporting will crack the silence that
surrounds honor killings, when family members, neighbors and even
the police conspire to cover up such a crime in order to hide the
shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any case, I will not stop (reporting),'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Husseini says she is willing to risk public censure if it means
ending honor killings and helping these women lead normal lives.
Keeping the problem under wraps will not make it go away, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our society and we have to face it,'' she said.
``These women can do something with themselves. Instead, they are
wasting their lives in fear or in prison.'' &QL;

HAVING IT: DESIRE BIDES ITS TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 18)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHAN TALTY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Raised working-class, I've often experienced pangs of
hot guilt over my desires _ not the sexual ones, but the retail
ones. Whenever I buy something expensive and wholly unnecessary, I
make a vow to do more for the struggling classes, to donate the
clothes in the back of my closet to the Salvation Army and to clean
my apartment thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   Put it this way: a while ago, I bought a Rolex. Today, I'm a
Catholic Big Brother.
</P>
<P>
   I accepted the penance (and my impish Little Brother, Angel)
because I have felt my Rolex Datejust and I were bound by fate.
There are books you must read in your life, and cities you must
travel to and a few things you must own. A Rolex was on top of my
list for three decades.
</P>
<P>
   For years, I waited. I had student loans to pay and, besides, I
was a struggling freelance writer who did legal proofreading at
night. A bright, shiny Rolex would have mocked me every day of my
penurious existence. So I postponed my dream of owning one.
</P>
<P>
   But I did become a student of the watch and its role in the
world. Probably too serious a student, looking back.
</P>
<P>
   Rolex's significance to people everywhere is obvious. Nice
houses, German sedans and Paris vacations are all well and good,
but the Swiss watch remains the premier mainstream symbol of Really
Making It in America. Rappers rap about their diamond-encrusted
ones; football players buy one the first day after they're picked
high in the draft. And Wall Street is still loyal to the
five-pointed crown. Rolex is the main noun in the international
language of success.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, my father came to New York for a visit. We
never saw the Statue of Liberty, but I did buy him a fake Rolex
from the African vendors who hawk them near the Liberty Island
ferry slip in lower Manhattan. Even though it cost only $25, my
father wears his Rolex only on special occasions, like weddings.
Even if it's fake, it was made in the image of something not fake _
something that has deep secular significance to him.
</P>
<P>
   A Rolex meant more to me than middle-class aspiration: it is a
man's watch first. Growing up, its mythology was all around me.
James Bond wore one, which doomed a fan like me to imagine that the
watch was a necessary accessory for any he-man exploits. Foreign
correspondents propped before exotic desert locations tend to wear
the fat Submariner model. People who set world records, or die
trying, favor the Explorer II.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, a Rolex is international currency: You can sell one for
emergency cash in Morocco or Zanzibar (or in Las Vegas for a
gambling stake, as Tom Cruise does in ``Rainman''). If you need a
gallon of gasoline to get across the last stretch of desert, how
are you going to haggle with some fussy little timepiece in your
hand? Most Tuaregs I know don't mess with Patek.
</P>
<P>
   The drawback, of course, is the watch's history as the official
watch of the ruling class, the bauble of the robber barons and the
rich boys at college who drove from Chemistry to Romantic Lit in
their Jags. I just had to believe my personality would overcome the
watch's dark side.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was me, but Rolex popped up everywhere in my life. In
my favorite television show of all time, ``Tales of the City,'' a
nurse shows off the watch her beau just gave her. ``Tag or a
Rolex?'' shouts another nurse excitedly.
</P>
<P>
   I understood the question: my watch at that time was a Tag
Heuer, a fine sports timepiece, but I knew it was just a
substitute, a look-alike, warming up my wrist for the daddy of all
watches. That nurse was right: a Tag meant one thing (``Thanks for
last night, hot stuff''), a Rolex another (``Marry me?'').
</P>
<P>
   The Rolex's power is such that it even attracts people who have
no real clue about why they want to own one. I was watching a
``20/20'' episode inspired by ``The Millionaire Next Door,'' the
best-selling book about extremely thrifty rich people. Tom Stanley,
its author, told the ``20/20'' correspondent, ``The typical
millionaire in the United States never spent more than $235 for the
most expensive watch.''
</P>
<P>
   But the newswoman spotted something on the wrist of one thrifty
millionaire named John Shmilenko. She zeroed in: ``Well, that's got
to cost a lot of money!'' she said triumphantly. But Shmilenko was
ready. ``Well, actually, it cost $25,'' he answered. ``I bought it
in Mexico. It's a fake Rolex.''
</P>
<P>
   Only in America would a millionaire wear a fake Rolex instead of
a Casio.
</P>
<P>
   One cultural phenomenon struck me through my years of
preparation: Rolex's resistance to mass-marketization. Once the
masses discover an ornament of the wealthy, rich people practically
throw it off their bodies as if it were made of garlic _ or
polyester. But the Rolex has been the exception to the rule.
</P>
<P>
   Collectors and watch-heads prefer Patek Philippe (30,000
hand-finished watches a year, versus Rolex's mass-produced 800,000
units). Still, there has been no shunning of the watch in high
places. It's still a high-roller's choice and part of the
stockbroker's uniform. Even as the market falls, it is a reminder
of the opulent '90s _ and a pagan amulet against the bear.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, three years ago, I received a substantial check from a
magazine. My student loan was paid off. I owned an inexpensive
co-op. I had no relatives who needed to be bailed out. At long
last, I was ready.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I entered the shops I had only ferociously window-shopped
before. I rolled the nautical Rolex vocabulary across my tongue
with salesmen: Oyster and Sea-Dweller and Submariner. At a posh
Upper East Side shop, I chose the classic stainless-steel Datejust.
When the salesman told me it was ``a good beginner Rolex,'' I
stared him down, then took my business elsewhere. The idea of a
beginner Rolex was too obscene even for me.
</P>
<P>
   I bought my Datejust elsewhere (for a rock-bottom $2,100), and
it was the cleanest looking thing I had ever seen. The watch seems
to defy the dust and grime and the dark end of the light spectrum.
Its fanatically polished steel blasts away the city's grime; it
catches the sun's rays and refracts them into bursts and shooting
lances of light, like Bilbao.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, I said it: My Rolex is like Bilbao. It is beautiful in
itself, beyond the world's evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   When I returned home and showed my dad my Datejust, he looked at
me feelingly. ``I always knew one day one of my sons would own a
Rolex,'' he said. I'm planning on buying Dad the real thing if I
ever hit the really big time.
</P>
<P>
   As for me, I'll probably die with this one on. Unashamed.

   BRANDEIS-ANNIVERSARY (Waltham, Mass.) _ As Brandeis alumni and
friends gather this weekend to celebrate the 50th anniversary of
their Jewish-sponsored, non-sectarian university, they are

GARDENING: JUST CALL THEM GLADS AND MOVE ON FROM THERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 18)  
 (bl)  
 By CASS PETERSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
 &HT;    Some worthy plants are victims of gardeners' prejudice, among
them marigolds, because of their scent; goldenrod, because it
resembles ragweed. and gladioluses, because they are so often the
flower of choice at funerals.
 &HT;    It is not the fault of gladioluses that their tall, spiky
flowers are perfectly suited to those coffin-flanking arrangements.
If delphiniums were cheaper in the florists' trade and available
all year round, they might be favored for funerals, too. Eschewing
delphiniums for that reason would be ludicrous, and that should
stimulate some reflection on the unfair treatment of gladioluses.
 &HT;    There are but two reasons not to grow gladioluses, neither very
persuasive. The first is confusion over singular and plural. Some
gardeners seem to prefer not to grow a plant that is a linguistic
challenge, although I haven't heard of many stewing over how to
form the plural of asparagus.
 &HT;    One gladiolus is a gladiolus, also acceptably a gladiola. More
than one are gladioluses or gladioli. If garden centers offered
gladioluses under one of their old-fashioned monikers, such as corn
flags or sword lilies, perhaps more of them would be grown.
 &HT;    The simple solution is to call one a glad and two or more glads.
It's a happy abbreviation.
 &HT;    The second reason not to grow glads is that they have an
inclination to incline, and sometimes even fall on their faces.
It's a characteristic shared by many flowers grown for their
stately, columnar appearance. Delphiniums do it, too.
 &HT;    There are ways to counter the proclivity of glads to grow askew.
Staking is an obvious solution. Growing them fairly close together
in clumps, rather than in rows, also helps. They can be grown
between bushy plants, like valerian or fall asters, which will give
the gladioluses something to lean on.
 &HT;    If grown against a wall or fence, glads can be kept upright with
a single strand of twine running from one end of the planting to
the other and put in place when the foliage is about two feet tall.
Some other plants can be grown in front of the glads to hide the
twine.
 &HT;    Having dispensed with the two reasons not to grow glads, let us
now consider the multitude of reasons to grow them. They are easily
raised from corms that are inexpensive enough to buy every year,
yet can be dug up and stored over winter if you want to go to the
small trouble that that entails.
 &HT;    They're striking in the garden _ hardly funereal, more like
vividly colored exclamation points. They're also long-lasting as
cut flowers, and they come in almost every imaginable color,
including greens that are really green rather than lime-yellow. I
like the darker colors, from the burgundy of Plum Tart to the
watermelon red of Applause, interspersed with a few gleaming spikes
of White Prosperity or peachy-salmon Peter Pears.
 &HT;    Glads can be planted a few at a time from midspring to midsummer
for a succession of bloom. Hummingbirds and bees like them.
 &HT;    They haven't many insect enemies, except thrips and occasionally
aphids. Aphids can be washed off with a hose. Not much can be done
about thrips, which will cause the flowers to be streaked or not to
open at all, but I've had trouble with thrips only twice in 25
years.
 &HT;    Rich soil will produce the tallest plants and the most flower
buds, but glads will bloom well in average soil. They aren't in the
least tolerant of shade, however. The last group of glads I grew
this year, next to a patch of sunflowers that blocked the afternoon
sun, were spindly.
 &HT;    Most glads grow from three to five feet tall _ the larger the
corm, the taller the glad. There are dwarf varieties as well, which
grow to only two feet and are hardy enough to stay in the ground
all winter. These are G. byzantinus. Regular glads have such an
intricate pedigree that they are not assigned to a species,
although catalogs occasionally refer to them as G. hybridus.
 &HT;    Winter-hardy glads have looser, less formal flower spikes with
blotched petals, and the color range is limited to white and shades
of pink. From Washington, D.C., south, regular glads might
overwinter, too, with a light mulch, but they will bloom better if
dug up and replanted in the spring.
 &HT;    Since I'm not in an area where glads will overwinter, I dig them
up about now, after frost has killed the foliage but before the
ground freezes. After drying for a week or so, the dead foliage and
the spent corm that produced this year's flower will snap off
easily.
 &HT;    What's left are new corms of various sizes. Any the size of a
quarter or larger will produce flowers next year. Smaller ones,
called cormels, can be planted in a nursery bed next spring and
grown to blooming size, but that's a bit of work for something that
costs as little as 20 cents a corm, if purchased in quantity.
Extra-large corms or fancier varieties may cost more, but glads are
still far less expensive than tulips or lilies.
 &HT;    Store the corms in a mesh bag someplace dark and cool but not
freezing. If thrips were a problem, store the corms in a paper bag
with a tablespoon of moth flakes. Alternatively, you could soak the
corms next spring, before planting them, in a Lysol solution (one
tablespoon to a gallon of water).
 &HT;    That should do in the thrips, and should be the last discussion
of death in connection with glads.
 &HT;

 &HT;     THIS WEEK: DEADHEADING PROLONGS THE SEASON  
 &HT;     By PATRICIA JONAS    c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't stop deadheading pansies, long-blooming perennials like
fragrant cottage pinks (Dianthus x alwoodii) and indispensable fall
bloomers like asters and the unfortunately named sneezeweeds.
(Helenium Coppelia has masses of mahogany-red flowers that fade to
burnt orange and are great for cutting.)
</P>
<P>
   Many plants will continue to thrive and bloom prolifically into
late fall if regularly deadheaded to redirect the plant's energy
from forming seed into forming flowers. Pull up spent annuals, but
remember to leave some seed heads for winter interest.
</P>
<P>
   There is still a little time to transplant and divide
perennials, but don't mulch until the ground is well frozen,
usually not until the end of November in New York City. Wait until
the foliage dies to dig up tender bulbs or tuberous plants. It's a
good time to decide which of these tender tropical and semitropical
plants are worth overwintering and find storage places where they
won't freeze.
</P>
<P>
   After a killing frost, cannas may be cut back to 3 inches, dug
up and cured in a dry spot for a day or two. They then need to be
tucked into blankets of barely moist peat in covered boxes and kept
from 40 to 50 degrees.

CHRIS ROCK MUCH FUNNIER IN PERSON THAN IN PRINT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM ROGERS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who has ever tried to do a Chris Rock bit for a friend
knows that it's impossible. Especially anyone who has attempted to
tell a Chris Rock joke and who happens to be white. Because you
can't tell a Rock joke without copping that voice.
</P>
<P>
   Say these words out loud: ``How much for a rib?''
</P>
<P>
   See?
</P>
<P>
   White people can do Chris Rock's jokes, but they can't do Chris
Rock. And, really, black people can't do him, either. He has what
they call, in street lingo, that je ne sais quoi.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what makes his new book, ``Rock This!'' (Hyperion,
$6.99), merely funny _ not hysterical, like Rock. Much of the book
is just stand-up written down (with the help of David Rensin). If
you've seen Rock's routine, then you'll recognize much of the book.
For example:
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   I also like Clinton because he really needs the job. He needs
the money. Why? Cinton's got real problems. He doesn't have
president problems. He's got real problems just like you and me.
</P>
<P>
   He's running out of money.
</P>
<P>
   His wife's a pain ...
</P>
<P>
   All of his friends are going to jail.
</P>
<P>
   I can relate to Clinton. I know Clinton. I am Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   As long as we're at it, here's more:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Everyone lies in a relationship. Everyone has secrets. We can't
go into all of them here, but for men, it's that most have some
porno hidden in their house.
</P>
<P>
   You know it's true. I can feel your tension already. You're
squeezing the pages together really hard. ...
</P>
<P>
   When men hide their porno stuff, they really hide it. A man
becomes Batman. It's not behind the speaker, not behind the
dresser, not under the couch. You pull at a book on the bookcase,
the whole (expletive deleted) wall slides to the left, and you
descend two flights of stairs into The Porno Pit.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Believe me, it's difficult to find funny excerpts in this book
that don't include ``adult themes'' and ``potty-mouth language.''
For more reasons than one, then, ``Rock This!'' makes for perfect
bathroom reading. It's a poor substitute for the real thing, but
it's still worth a laugh.

ROBERT TOWNE PUSHES THE `LIMITS' OF WORK AND OBSESSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Towne manages to be sanguine about the Peter Biskind book
``Easy Riders, Raging Bulls,'' which revels in the seamy,
self-obsessed side of the moviemaking generation that came to power
in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me put it to you'' this way, Towne responds, in his
reassuring murmur. ``If you were happily married to your wife for
20 years, and you had one knock-down, drag-out fight and then
someone wrote about only that one fight, of course you'd look bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, if we'd all been such terrible people, why would
anybody have made movies with us?''
</P>
<P>
   And Towne _ who made his reputation as a script doctor,
repairing such pictures as ``Bonnie &AMP; Clyde'' and ``The Godfather''
before becoming a legend as a writer with ``The Last Detail,
Shampoo'' and ``Chinatown'' _ is still making movies. His latest,
``Without Limits,'' the story of Olympic long-distance runner Steve
Prefontaine, opened last week, with Billy Crudup in the title role.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second film about Prefontaine, whose career was cut
tragically short by an auto accident not long after the 1972
Olympics; ``Prefontaine,'' with Jared Leto, made little impression
with critics or audiences last year. Still, Towne was fascinated by
the man affectionately known as Pre, who was a media icon in the
world of track and field. ``It was the last amateur moment in track
in this country,'' Towne says, ``where a star in that field was
doing it not for the love of money, since he was making only $3 a
day. So he was doing it for the love of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pushing your own limits, which is what I think an artist does.
And Steve actually did say, `I consider a race to be a work of
art,' so it's not hard to see how I could identify with that. For
him, his race was something he held to a higher standard than
simple victory. So the story of a front-runner who's more concerned
with pushing himself to the very limits of consciousness is
intriguing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Several threads can be found in Towne's writing; one is that he
details the lives of those who are wedded to their work. ``I've
always written about protagonists who are obsessive about their
work. You think about the obsessive private detective in
`Chinatown,' the hairdresser in `Shampoo,' the athletes in
`Personal Best' and now in `Without Limits,' the obsessive drug
dealer. It has always struck (me) that men who (are) defined by
what they do are inherently dramatic, and there's always that
possibility of tension between their dedication to their work, and
anything personal that might interfere with it. I guess it's just
another wrinkle on that oldest conflict in drama, the conflict
between love and duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Towne's concentration on defining his character by their
professions, and that overwhelming attachment to work, is
specifically American. How does that come to him? ``Well,'' he
says, sighing, ``the nearest that I can tell, is that it probably
comes from watching Disney cartoons.''
</P>
<P>
   Pardon?
</P>
<P>
   He laughs. ``Look, when I grew up and you went to the movies,
there was always a little cartoon, a Disney cartoon. And it was
Mickey and Donald's moving day, or Mickey and Donald window washing
on the skyscrapers. Or Mickey and Donald as ghostbusters. So, the
first lesson I learned as a 5-year-old is that people have to
figure out what they want to do. Right away!
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, for the animators,'' Towne observes, ``it was a great way
of showing movement. If you're a kid, that makes a great
impression.The thing that a good mouse and duck do, is figure out
what to do with their lives, how they're gonna make a living. And
coming out of the Depression, that was an ongoing concern of
everyone's.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his other work as a writer-director, ``Without Limits'' is
about competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's just a way of hardening the target. And
competition and emphasis on competition is a very American
preoccupation, being a winner. In the end, I don't know how you
reconcile that, because in the end, the competition is between you
and you.''

FOR FATHER AND SON, THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A TRAIN TRIP THROUGH THE
ROCKIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM MADIGAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLORADO and NEW MEXICO _ I like the way our vacation pictures
turned out.
</P>
<P>
   There's Patrick, my 7-year-old son, smiling out the window of
our passenger car as the vintage steam engine chugs along in the
background. Next picture: Patrick again, in the open flat car at
the end of the train, grinning up at the camera as rails disappear
into the mountains behind him. Next: Black clouds of smoke
billowing from two locomotives as they climb through the aspens;
then the deep, craggy face of Toltec Gorge as seen from hundreds of
feet above, on the thin ribbon of rail.
</P>
<P>
   It had been a day for my boy, who is a train nut. But the photos
remind of the rustling aspens, the mountains all around, the deep
gorges, trestles over mountain streams, inky tunnels, a doe on the
hill, the brisk air. If this jaunt through the Rocky Mountains on
the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad was kid stuff, then I was
glad to be a boy again, too.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Chama, N.M., is a three-hour drive northwest from our cabin in
the Sangre De Cristo Mountains near Angel Fire, so my wife, Patrick
and I leave at 6 a.m. to make our midmorning departure. Past Taos,
there is flatness and desert, sweet-smelling sagebrush spreading to
the horizon. Then mountains again, great orange vistas in the
morning sun.
</P>
<P>
   The little town of Chama, a few miles south of the Colorado
border, seems to exist only to serve the historic railroad and the
roughly 60,000 riders the Cumbres and Toltec attracts from mid-May
until the riding season ends in mid-October. Restaurants, hotels
and souvenir shops line the street up the hill from a rustic rail
station, which includes an old-time blacksmith shop and tall heaps
of coal waiting for steam-engine boilers.
</P>
<P>
   The Chama station dates from the 1880s, when the 64-mile route
between the town and Antonito, Colo., was one spur of the Denver
and Rio Grande Railroad built to service mining camps and logging
operations in the San Juan Mountains. Until area highways were
upgraded during World War II, the railroad was the only means of
travel through the rugged, remote territory.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1960s, mining had petered out, the automobile was
king, and mountain railroads like this one had become obsolete.
Were it not for some persistent rail buffs, the tracks we rode that
day in August would have been long abandoned _ rusting mountain
relics like the tumbledown shacks seen here and there along the
mountain line.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in 1970, after lobbying by railroad lovers, New Mexico
and Colorado jointly purchased the 64-mile track between Chama and
Antonito, and a thriving tourist enterprise was born.
</P>
<P>
   Thus on a sunny mountain morning nearly three decades later, we
board one of several full passenger cars as two locomotives huff
from Chama station at the head of our train. The extra oomph is
necessary for the long, 4-degree incline toward Cumbres Pass, which
at 10,015 feet is the highest pass on any scheduled passenger train
in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Even with two engines, the task sometimes seems too much. We
wonder whether the gritty old machines will conk out and send us
rolling back down through the mountains. To ride the Cumbres and
Toltec is to gain new appreciation for the Little Engine That
Could. But we lumber on _ at only 10 mph most of the time, but up
we go.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the tracks cross roads or highways, cars, pickups and
semi-trailers stop, and smiling, waving people emerge from their
vehicles to stand near the tracks with cameras, capturing a little
of the romance.
</P>
<P>
   Farther on, cattle graze in high pastures that are inaccessible
by car or pickup. Several brown-and-white horses dash from one end
of a fenced pasture to another when the train nears. Two fly
fishermen stand knee deep in a stream below us. One turns and
waves. We notice our hair and clothes are flecked by coal dust. The
train whistle howls, echoing off the mountains. On the trip to
Antonito, we cross back and forth from New Mexico to Colorado 11
times.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway to our destination, the train pull into a depot built in
remote range land, and the hundreds of passengers file off for
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The best scenery comes shortly after our journey resumes. Toltec
Gorge falls off to the right, its jagged face plummeting to the Rio
de Los Pinos, which means River of the Pines in Spanish. The river
is running fast, and even from our rail perch 600 feet up, we see
white water.
</P>
<P>
   The locomotive _ only one now since lunch because most of the
trip is downhill _ enters the trip's first tunnel _ 360 feet
chiseled through a mountain. We emerge from the blackness into the
sunlight, and tower above the river for several crooked miles. Far
below, cabins with red roofs dot the land along the river. They are
only summer homes, says brakeman Felipe Romero. In winter, those
homes are buried beneath 15 feet of snow, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Romero worked in a mine before getting laid off and has been
with the railroad for eight years. He never grows tired of his job,
he says, because of the scenery and the people he meets from around
the world. He agrees that the second half of the trip is much
prettier than the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you ought to see it in the fall,'' he says. ``By
mid-September the aspens are changing color, yellows, reds,
oranges. That's the best time to ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Closer to Antonito, the land levels out and we return to desert.
By now, after more than five hours on the rails, the trip has
become a bit grueling. Weary adults bump along in their seats,
sleeping children bouncing along in their laps. It seems to take an
hour to get from the Antonito town limits to the station.
</P>
<P>
   Most passengers are ready for the trip to end. We gratefully
shuffle from the train onto waiting, air-conditioned buses supplied
by the railroad for the ride back to our cars in Chama. That trip
takes less than an hour. The buses are decorated in Southwestern
colors, have television screens above the seats and tinted windows,
an instructive contrast to our previous mode of travel.
</P>
<P>
   It is very late by the time we reach the cabin back in Angel
Fire. We are bone-tired, a reality that overshadows some of the
day's pleasures. But then we return to Texas, where the grass is
brown and the air is 100 degrees. We get our photos back after a
few days. I see my son's happy face, and the mountains and the
locomotives and remember the feel of the cool alpine air.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm glad that Patrick loves trains.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   If you go
</P>
<P>
   Fares range from $34 to $52 for adults, and $17 to $27 for
children under 11. A variety of trip packages are available. For
more information, call Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad at the
Chama Station, (505) 756-2151; or the Antonito Station, (719)
376-5483.

`DEAD MAN WALKING' AUTHOR FINDS ATTITUDES ABOUT EXECUTION CHANGING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sister Helen Prejean, the author of ``Dead Man Walking,'' is
full of life. The spirited Roman Catholic nun's smiles and hugs won
her audience long before she began speaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking my case to the American people,'' said Prejean, who
munched a sandwich as she greeted old and new acquaintances and
signed autographs before speaking out against the death penalty
last week at St. Rita Catholic Church in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Since actress Susan Sarandon won an Academy Award for her
portrayal of Prejean in the acclaimed movie version of ``Dead Man
Walking,'' the nun has been much in demand and her audiences are
larger.
</P>
<P>
   Prejean, who wore a simple silver cross and street clothes,
noted that her book about her ministry to men on Louisiana's Death
Row is also being made into a play and an opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm especially excited about the play, because I can see it
being performed on university campuses and in community theaters,''
Prejean said.
</P>
<P>
   What she likes most about her bigger crowds, she said, is that
she has the chance to speak to backers and opponents of the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the movie came out, my audiences would be about 100
people, and 98 of them would already be against the death
penalty,'' she said. Now she often draws more than 1,000, and last
week she spoke to about 700 at her Fort Worth stop.
</P>
<P>
   Also, sales of her book increased dramatically after the movie.
Her book was on the bestseller list for 31 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   She has no misconceptions that the death penalty will be
abolished right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we are just solidly locked into the death
penalty,'' she said. ``There's not a politician running for office
who says they are not for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Prejean noted that some good, decent people support the death
penalty because of their outrage over crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm outraged, too,'' she said. ``And we have to talk about
that outrage, and what we as a society are going to do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now she believes many grassroots Americans are beginning to
change their minds about the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of surface support for the death penalty, but
right below that surface, people are ambivalent,'' she said. ``And
it just shows me that people are good and decent, and they've been
manipulated into this thing. Give them information and they reject
it _ including the people of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People see we are doing the death penalty left and right, and
there is still horrible crime,'' she said. ``More people are
asking, `Do we have to keep doing this? Or is there an
alternative?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Prejean believes that the death penalty violates Christian
teaching about the sanctity of human life. She also argues that it
is unfairly administered _ that only those with a less skillful
lawyer are sentenced to die, and that it is applied in a racist
manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty-five percent of people who go to Death Row are there
because they've killed white people,'' she said. ``When people of
color are killed, or homeless people or poor people are killed,
there's not a shrug of the shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Prejean travels internationally and last year met with Pope John
Paul II, who has led the Catholic Church to oppose capital
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot is happening internationally, because more and more
countries are voting to abolish the death penalty,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In March she was in Geneva during a meeting of the U.N.
Commission on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``A majority of the countries voted for a moratorium on the
death penalty, moving toward abolition,'' she said. ``But the
United States voted against it, along with Iran, Iraq, China and
Saudi Arabia.''
</P>
<P>
   Prejean believes that international pressure will eventually
lead to abolishing the death penalty in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it won't happen by 9 o'clock tomorrow morning,'' she said.

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO OPEN OFFICE TO RESPOND TO TERRORIST ATTACKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department will open an office
dedicated to helping state and local rescue squads respond quickly
and effectively to terrorist attacks within the United States,
leaders of the federal agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our communities are very unprepared'' for a terrorist
attack, said Bob Blitzer, chief of the FBI's domestic terrorism
unit and head of the new National Domestic Preparedness Office. The
office, in collaboration with state and local agencies, will
determine what training and equipment communities need to quicken
their responses to biological, chemical and explosives attacks,
Blitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   The new federal office will include agents from the FBI and
personnel from the Defense Department, Federal Emergency Management
Agency and Public Health Service. The facility will help police
officers, fire fighters and paramedics rescue victims of terrorism
but will not interfere with the authority of state and local
agencies to respond as they see fit, Blitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't tell the fire chief how to fight a fire,'' he said,
noting that local safety personnel know their communities' needs
better than does the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said the office will be part of the
FBI and help local agencies set training standards for their
emergency responders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not interested in a top down, one-size-fits-all
solution,'' Reno said, adding that each local police department,
fire house, ambulance company and hospital might require different
training and equipment. ``If we can do this the right way, we will
make a difference and help save lives the next time a terrorist
strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the new office will focus on saving lives after a
violent attack, the FBI's ``first and foremost'' mission will
continue to be thwarting terrorism, the attorney general said.
</P>
<P>
   But, Reno added, ``we won't be able to prevent everything.''
Federal, state and local agencies must prepare for the possibility
of terrorist attacks involving a wide range of weapons of mass
destruction, including viruses, chemicals and bombs, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a terrorist act strikes the streets of rural areas of
America, the first few minutes are very critical,'' Reno said.
``The situation is often chaotic and dangerous. For many victims,
what these first responders do in those first few minutes can mean
the difference between life and death.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the new office, which will have a nearly $50 million
budget this year, can be especially helpful in the Justice
Department's efforts to coordinate a federal, state and local
response to a biological attack.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Public Health Service, which has studied ways to
thwart biological terrorism, is ``very anxious to be part of this
team,'' the attorney general said. ``We need to reach out to
hospitals and local public health services,'' she added. &QL;

WHITE HOUSE WEIGHS RESUBMITTING HORMEL BID FOR AMBASSADOR POST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: UPDATES 2d graf, saying Congress is expected to adjourn
Tuesday instead of ``in the next few days.'')   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the wake of the apparent failure of the Senate
to approve the nomination of gay rights advocate James C. Hormel to
be ambassador to Luxembourg, the White House is considering whether
to resubmit his bid next year.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Socarides, special assistant to the president, said
Friday that if Congress adjourns Tuesday _ as expected _ without
acting on Hormel's nomination, ``the president will weigh what
options he has.''
</P>
<P>
   Socarides added that ``a recess appointment is an option, a post
that doesn't require Senate confirmation is an option, or the
president would resubmit his name next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The aide, who said the White House will consult with Hormel to
see what he wants, added: ``The president has used his recess
appointment power very sparingly. Resubmitting the nomination is
always a more likely scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Socarides stressed that the administration ``is deeply
disappointed that Mr. Hormel's nomination has not been acted on
simply because he is gay. We have a commitment to him that we are
going to do everything we can to see that someone who is as
qualified and distinguished as Mr. Hormel can make the contribution
he has so graciously offered to make to this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., a leading advocate for Hormel,
has urged President Clinton ``to use his constitutional authority
to make a recess appointment of Hormel,'' according to her press
secretary, Jim Hock.
</P>
<P>
   He said Feinstein believes that ``the failure to vote on his
nomination is really quite incomprehensible. She believes he's been
denied the constitutionally delineated due process of a Senate vote
and debate simply because he is gay.''
</P>
<P>
   Hock said Feinstein, who has known Hormel for more than two
decades, deems him ``a man of decency and honor and the type of
person who should be encouraged to be in public service.''
</P>
<P>
   Hormel's nomination has been blocked by Senate Republicans for
nearly a year. Conservatives, including Sens. James M. Inhofe,
R-Okla., Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., and Robert C. Smith, R-N.H., used
a parliamentary maneuver known as a ``hold'' to stymie a floor
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents said a gay activist would be an inappropriate
choice for the job because Luxembourg is a predominantly Catholic
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., likened
homosexuality to kleptomania, alcoholism and sex addiction. He has
refused to bring Hormel's nomination to the Senate floor for a vote
since it was approved 16 to 2 last November by the Foreign
Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel, a San Francisco philanthropist, is a Democratic Party
donor, former dean at the University of Chicago Law School and heir
to the Hormel meat packing fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Winnie Stachelberg, political director for the Human Rights
Campaign, the nation's largest gay and lesbian organization which
Hormel helped found, called the Republican stalling on Hormel's
nomination ``another example of anti-gay bias.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Hormel ``surely would have won'' if his nomination had
come up for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   She also said the nomination was failing because ``he is honest
and open about who he is. Unfortunately, there are people in the
U.S. Senate who think it's okay to discriminate against gay people
simply because of their sexual orientation. It sends a signal not
only to Jim Hormel but to an entire community of people that just
because of their sexual orientation they can't hold certain jobs. I
would have thought that our country was beyond that. It's clear to
me that we have a long way to go.''

   &UR; FOR SUNDAY, OCT. 18 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times News Service is planning the following Money
and Business articles for release Sunday, Oct. 18, 1998:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ON THE SECTION FRONT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ECON-COLUMN (Undated) _ An expanded version of the weekly
ECON-COLUMN that offers a report card on the nation's economic
expansion. By Louis Uchitelle. With graphics.
</P>
<P>
   EXCLUSIVE-COLUMBIA-HCA (Undated) _ Exclusive interview with
James F. Alderson, the small-town accountant who filed suit on
behalf of the United States charging four giant hospital companies
with fraud. For years Alderson stewed with the belief that the
companies _ the huge Hospital Corp. of America and three of its
corporate spinoffs _ had cheated the government with bogus expense
claims. While working at a Montana hospital run by one of those
companies, Alderson himself had been instructed to create a second
set of books recording different expenses than those reported to
the government. He had refused, saying it was unethical. Then his
world fell apart. By Kurt Eichenwald. With exclusive photos.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET-WATCH (Undated) _ Weekly feature looking at developments
in the world's stock markets. By Gretchen Morgenson. With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INSIDE THE SECTION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BIZ-GOLDFISH-CRACKERS (Norwalk, Conn.) _ Campbell Soup
reinvigorated Pepperidge Farm, led by the classic but newly cool
Goldfish cracker, using smarter marketing and brand extensions. Can
they do the same for the rest of the profitable but slow-growth
company? By Constance L. Hays. With Photo and Graphics. (Moved.)
</P>
<P>
   BIZ-PROFILE-KAWASAKI (Undated) _ Guy Kawasaki has taken a leave
of absence from Apple Computer Inc. to concentrate on Garage.com,
an Internet-based company that will match high-technology
entrepreneurs with private investors. ``I want to help the next
Apple get started,'' he said. By Roy Furchgott. With Photo.
(Moved.)
</P>
<P>
   BIZ-ETHICS (Undated) _ Welcome to the modern workplace, where
companies are so concerned about wrongful-termination suits that
silence often takes the place of honest communication. Most
managers with power to dismiss have faced the problem: whether or
not to let people know why a colleague has been let go. By Jeffrey
L. Seglin. (Moved.)
</P>
<P>
   BIZ-CATALYST-WOMEN (Undated) _ A recent survey by a women's
research group found that the boards of directors of 71 companies
among the Fortune 500 were made up entirely of men. To those who
have followed the results of such annual surveys by Catalyst, a
nonprofit organization in New York, the news undoubtedly sounded
familiar. The fact that roughly 14 percent of the 500 largest
companies do not have a single women director begs a simple
question: ``Why?'' By Adam Bryant. With graphic. (Moved.)
</P>
<P>
   BIZ-PRELUDES (Undated) _ For a year, Edward Lecomte listened to
an incessant stream of talk about ``the market.'' Friends boasted
about booming stock portfolios, his sister made a bundle in a
mutual fund and colleagues badgered him to jump on the bandwagon.
So last winter, Lecomte, 37, decided it was time to become a
player. His experiences will amuse, dishearten and perhaps terrify.
By Abby Ellin. (Moved.)
</P>
<P>
   BIZ-5-QUESTIONS-TOYOTA (Undated) _ In the three years he has
been president of Toyota Motor Corp., Hiroshi Okuda has become
known as much for his black belt in judo as for his outspoken views
and aggressive moves to revitalize the once very conservative
automobile maker that the stock market values as Japan's largest
publicly traded company. By Sharon R. King. With Photo. (Moved.)
</P>
<P>
   INVEST-WITH-LEWIS (Undated) _ ``I've got a calm personality, so
I don't get too excited when we go way up, and I don't get too down
when we go way down,'' said Gary Lewis, the manager of the Van
Kampen Emerging Growth fund in his 45th floor Houston office. This
is fortunate, because funds like the one Lewis manages, which
invested in small and mid-cap stocks with higher price-earnings
ratios, have taken it on the chin. By William R. Long.
</P>
<P>
   INVEST-INSIGHT-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Interview with manager of Scudder
Japan Fund. By Kenneth N. Gilpin.
</P>
<P>
   INVEST-MUTUAL (Undated) _ The roster of value players at Mutual
Series will remain the same after chief executive officer Michael
Price officially departs next month, but they will be getting new
positions. By Carole Gould. With Graphic.
</P>
<P>
   INVEST-ASIA (Undated) _ Asian stocks, bonds and real estate are
not all that have been marked down for immediate clearance. From
Hyundai's humble econoboxes to Honolulu's choicest penthouses,
other merchandise made, owned or offered by Asians is also priced
to sell. By Allen R. Myerson. (Moved.)
</P>
<P>
   LYDELL-HOTEL-PROFILE (Sheridan, N.Y.) _ Ransom Lydell guessed
right 17 years ago when he thought that there would be a booming
market for the lily-like perennials called hostas. But spotting a
money-making opportunity is one thing. Exploiting it is another. By
Laura Pedersen-Pietersen. (Moved.)
</P>
<P>
   WORKING-COLUMN (Undated) _ As backward as it may sound, some
companies have a bias against people who've had the brashness to
blaze their own trails. By Michelle Cottle. (Moved.)
</P>
<P>
   INVEST-INTEL (Undated) _ A technology investor has no choice but
to own Intel, right? Maybe. But not everyone believes Intel is a
compelling buy at this price. By Lawrence M. Fisher. With Graphic.
</P>
<P>
   BIZ-DIARY (Undated) _ Weekly column highlighting business news
of the week.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AUTOS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ABOUT-CARS-ODYSSEY (Detroit) _ Honda has arrived at the minivan
party with a new model, the 1999 Odyssey, which is even more
magical than Chrysler's offerings, and Chrysler faces its toughest
competition yet. By Michelle Krebs. With Photo.
</P>
<P>
   AUTOS-MINIVAN (Undated) _ Rumors of the demise of the minivan
are premature. By Cheryl Jensen.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STAND ALONE GRAPHIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   IN-MY-WALLET (Undated) _ A voyeuristic short feature that lets
readers see business personalities in more dimensions than they are
usually portrayed. This week: John Reed and his wallet.

<P>
   CALIFORNIA -- OMNI. BART, the Bay Area's subway system, is
poised to get roughly $250 million in the catchall spending bill
that Congress is set to approve Tuesday. Stricherz
</P>
<P>
   CONNECTICUT -- Working on project. Maggi
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA -- COLUMN. Weekly column with U.S. Reps. Dan Miller,
R-Bradenton, and Porter Goss, R-Sanibel. Williams
</P>
<P>
   GEORGIA -- FEC. A look at the latest fund-raising reports from
the Coverdell-Coles and Norwood-Freeman races. Williams
</P>
<P>
   -- CONGRESS. After starting with a bang last year -- a balanced
budget agreement leading to the first surplus in three decades --
the 105th Congress' biggest achievements in 1998 are a six-year
highway bill and 11th-hour funding to hire more teachers. Williams
</P>
<P>
   IDAHO -- FEC. Examination of reports to the Federal Election
Commission from congressional and senate candidates. Brown
</P>
<P>
   ILLINOIS -- BRIEFS. Column for Sunday. Eckstein
</P>
<P>
   MASSACHUSETTS -- FEC. A comparison of the FEC reports from the
Third District congressional race: McGovern and Amorello. Preston
</P>
<P>
   NEVADA -- FEC. A comparison of the FEC reports from the Las

</P>
<P>
   OHIO -- FEC. Northeast Ohio lawmakers are detailing their
campaign finances in the latest reporting with the Federal Election
Commission. Gorman
</P>
<P>
   PENNSYLVANIA -- DONOR. In 1997 and so far in 1998, Cambria
residents have given $75,699 in contributions to candidates for the
U.S. House and Senate, according to an independent analysis of
Federal Election Commission reports. Those totals are a far cry
from how much money pours into campaign coffers from the bigger
cities of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, and some say it's a
particularly tough predicament for statewide candidates who don't
hail from those regions. Kane
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS -- CAUCUS. Reps. Ciro Rodriguez and Ruben Hinojosa joined
several members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to tout
several victories in the omnibus spending bill, and to blast
congressional Republicans for fighting against many of their
initiatives. Brown
</P>
<P>
   VIRGIN ISLANDS -- BUDGET. The new federal budget deal contains
funds for two of three Virgin Islands priorities, and V.I. Delegate
to Congress Donna Christian-Green still hopes to stick in the third
item before next week's final vote. Williams
</P>
<P>
   WISCONSIN -- EDUCATION. The budget that Congress just finalized
will mean new teachers for local schools, but the area won't get as
much money as other areas because the school system is already in
decent shape. Marlin/Butler
</P>
<P>
   -- MILK. The new budget means the same old dairy pricing system
for Wisconsin, as lawmakers faced powerful opposition in trying to
keep reform on track. Marlin

WHERE THE TROUT ARE JUST A BONUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RUSTY HALL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE CITY, Colo. _ A flash of light exploded from the depths of
the deep pool in the bend of the creek. The rainbow trout caught
the hook as it broke the surface. At the apex of its leap, the fish
twisted, seemed to hang for a moment in midair, then crashed back
into the stream.
</P>
<P>
   The fight didn't last long and the trout wasn't a giant, but the
memory has stayed with me. And that memory defines why, for me,
vacationing in Colorado means fly-fishing instead of skiing or
white-water rafting.
</P>
<P>
   If I close my eyes, I can still hear the river, smell the pines
and sense the grandeur of the towering mountain peaks in the high
country of Colorado, where the only tension is in the fishing line,
and the cool air soothes work-weary souls.
</P>
<P>
   To someone from Texas more accustomed to cowboy boots than hip
boots, fly-fishing seemed an exotic sport requiring the dexterity
of a gymnast and the bank account of a Rockefeller. Over the years,
I've learned it simply ain't that tough, or expensive. It's still
exotic, and the scenery is as breathtaking as the water is cold.
</P>
<P>
   All you need is a fly rod, a handful of flies, waders and a
cold, clear river _ just like the ones in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   We Texans don't have trout streams in our neighborhoods.
Fortunately, an abundance of quality fly-fishing is just one long
day's drive away in southern Colorado and northern New Mexico. Many
of the rivers in this region are well-known, like the San Juan, Rio
Grande and South Platte, but it's the small, high mountain streams
where it's fun to learn how to fly-fish and then keep coming back
for more.
</P>
<P>
   Places like Cebolla and Henson creeks, along with the Lake Fork
of the Gunnison River near Lake City, Colo., nestled in the heart
of the San Juan Mountains. Water pours out of the mountains of
southern Colorado. There's the Conejos River near Platoro
Reservoir, the upper San Juan north of Pagosa Springs, the Animas,
Los Pinos and Florida near Durango, and no fewer than 47 small
tributaries flow into the Rio Grande from the mountains around
South Fork, Colo. I haven't fished them all, but I'm working on it.
Farther north, the area around Rocky Mountain National Park is
great, along with the creeks and streams around Breckenridge, Aspen
and Crested Butte.
</P>
<P>
   Most high mountain streams are cold, fast-flowing and uncrowded.
Also, these creeks are usually filled with opportunistic, hungry
trout. Unlike their finny kin in better-known, more heavily fished
rivers, trout in these swift, high-mountain streams aren't in the
habit of closely inspecting your fly as it rushes past. They are
more eager to take what they can get.
</P>
<P>
   While high-country trout _ mostly brook trout, rainbows with the
occasional cutthroat in the highest reaches _ are smaller than many
of the trout at the lower elevations, they make up for their lack
of size with the aggressiveness of a bantam-weight prizefighter.
</P>
<P>
   That aggressiveness also makes fly selection simple. From the
end of spring runoff in mid- to late July through September, a
handful of flies is all you need.
</P>
<P>
   A fly shop is also a great place to start a Colorado fishing
vacation. Advice is free, and knowledge of the local conditions is
an on-going topic of conversation. I usually have to get a license
anyway, and in Colorado a five-day license is $18.26. Additional
one-day licenses can be added for $5.25. An annual nonresident
fishing license is $40.25. Children younger than 16 are not
required to have a license, but the bag limit for them is half the
daily adult bag and possession limit. Fishing is allowed
year-round, except where otherwise noted in the regulations.
Because these regulations can vary from stream to stream, it's best
to pick up a fishing brochure that is usually available where
licenses are sold.
</P>
<P>
   The fun starts on the stream. Even an experienced fly fisherman
should practice the fluid, back-and-forth casting motion in the
back yard a couple of times before heading out on a trip. That's
something I seem to never get around to and consequently spend the
first day of the trip hooking bushes instead of trout.
</P>
<P>
   Fly rods are categorized by their length and the weight of the
line used. I use a good general purpose 9-foot, five-weight rod. A
shorter, lighter-weight rod is probably better on small streams
because it casts a thinner line more delicately. But even a more
robust six- or seven-weight rod can get the job done. It's just
more rod than you need for a 10- to 12-inch trout.
</P>
<P>
   An ultra-thin, monofilament fishing line, called a leader, is
attached to the end of the fly line, and the fly is tied to the
other end. The result is 7 to 12 feet of almost invisible
connection between the heavy fly line and the fly.
</P>
<P>
   Once I'm on the stream, I look for pockets or holes where fish
will hold up out of the swift current, saving their energy. I try
to slip up on the spot from downstream and cast upstream above the
pocket where the fly can float over a likely spot. The key is to
allow the fly to drift without any unnatural drag created by the
fly line being pulled by the current. It takes a little practice,
but the enjoyment of a trout dashing up to hit the fly is
sufficient reward.
</P>
<P>
   But even when the fish aren't biting, I enjoy sitting down at
the edge of the river and taking a break to remember other times
when the fish were biting. Then I look around at snow-capped peaks,
smell the forest, and listen to the gurgle of the river at my feet.
As it turns out, catching fish is just a bonus in Colorado's high
country.

GARRY MAURO: DARKHORSE DEMOCRAT KEEPS HIS EYE ON THE PRIZE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 18)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA TOLLEY  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It is crunch time on the campaign trail, and on
this particular day, Garry Mauro is munching on popcorn for lunch
before catching a flight to San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The polls are against him, the money isn't flowing his way and
even some stalwarts in his own party have forsaken him for his
opponent, but Mauro doesn't act like a man headed for a predicted
major defeat.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Democratic challenger to Republican Gov. George W.
Bush seems energized and even a little cocky as he heads into the
frenzied final days of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   No, he is not a political Don Quixote. He has just been the
underdog before _ and won.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real comfortable with who I am,'' Mauro, 50, says
confidently as talks about why he would make a good governor.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the past five governor's races, he says he has reason to
be optimistic about the Nov. 3 election. In those races, the
challengers were never ahead of the incumbent in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only poll they ever won was on Election Day,'' Mauro
notes. ``If I were George Bush, I'd be worried right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the political tide is running against Mauro and threatens
to sweep him off the map on Election Day. In Bush, Mauro faces a
well-funded, popular son of a former president who himself is
considered prime presidential timber for the 2000 race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm worried. I don't want to lose,'' Mauro concedes at
one point in an interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   But Mauro, the Texas land commissioner for the past 16 years,
would rather spend his time talking about his ideas, his
qualifications, his background and his vision for Texas than the
polls _ which show him trailing Bush by some 50 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the polls say, he has no regrets about getting
into this uphill race.
</P>
<P>
   ``There comes a precise moment in time when a state or a
generation can make a decision that will really make a
difference,'' Mauro says. ``I think we have the opportunity of a
lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro wants to take advantage of the state's robust economy and
an expected $6 billion cash surplus to, among other things, give
teachers a big raise, build more schools and make schools adhere to
limits on the number of students per class.
</P>
<P>
   ``This state is in such a good position to lay a real foundation
for the 21st century,'' he notes. ``And I think George Bush is
complacent. I don't think he has a sense of urgency about anything
... I don't wait. I don't hang back.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro is quick to list his experience in explaining why he
qualifies for the state's top job. And he voices some frustration
over the name recognition Bush gets from his politically famous
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bring a set of life experiences to any job, and I'm
surprised people haven't been more interested in going beyond my 16
years as land commissioner,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of Bush's biggest strengths is that he is a decent man
from a decent family,'' Mauro says. ``But I'm surprised people
haven't been more interested in my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro's Italian family includes a great-grandfather who was a
tenant farmer in Tabor who never learned to speak English, and a
father, now dead, who was the first person in his family to get a
college degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just as proud of my family as I imagine George is of
his.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Bryan, Mauro later attended Reicher High School, a
private Catholic school in Waco. He played on the high school's
state championship football team.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, Mauro went to Texas A&AMP;M, where he was a
freshman football player and later a yell leader. Still a die-hard
Aggie, he recently took a few hours off from his grueling campaign
schedule to catch an A&AMP;M football game.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, he worked on the attempted comeback campaign of former
Sen. Ralph Yarborough, who lost the Democratic primary. After that,
he finished law school at the University of Texas and worked in
private practice.
</P>
<P>
   But his heart belonged to politics. He worked on several
campaigns before announcing his first candidacy, running and
winning the land commissioner's race at age 34 in 1982. He was
re-elected three times.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro says he also learned a lot about state government as a
deputy to then-Comptroller Bob Bullock.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock, a Democrat who is retiring from politics when his term
as lieutenant governor expires next year, is the godfather of one
of Mauro's children. But Bullock shocked political circles when he
endorsed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro says he still considers Bullock a friend, but he adds that
the two don't talk anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``What am I going to talk to him about right now?'' he asks
candidly. ``All I'm doing right now is running for governor.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Mauro was first elected land commissioner, the Democrats
swept the statewide offices. Now, he's the last Democrat elected in
that sweep who is still in office, and it is the Republicans who
have their eye on taking it all this time.
</P>
<P>
   As land commissioner, Mauro notes, he established the state's
successful Adopt-A-Beach program; boosted income from leases of
state lands that went to schools; fought oil spills; and worked to
improve veterans' benefits that come from the land commission
office.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure, Mauro ran President Clinton's Texas campaigns
in 1992 and 1996. The two are old friends, and Clinton recently was
in San Antonio and Houston to help Mauro raise money.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro has remained supportive of Clinton, saying he can't defend
the president's actions in the Monica Lewinsky affair, but does
forgive him.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro's days in office also have been marked with some
controversy. He filed for personal bankruptcy and apologized for
making more than 200 telephone calls from his state office to
Clinton's campaign headquarters in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer of 1997, Mauro toured Texas promoting his book
``Beaches, Bureaucrats and Big Oil,'' and thought about whether he
wanted to run for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats thought about it as well but decided to skip the
chance of being beaten by a strong incumbent. Mauro decided to run.
</P>
<P>
   He went home to his old neighborhood in Bryan to announce his
campaign for governor. Then he went to Waco, where he announced his
candidacy on the steps of the McLellan County Courthouse. He worked
there briefly more than 40 years ago for $1 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was an elevator operator at age 14 at the McLellan
County Courthouse, I never dreamed I was going to come back to that
same courthouse and announce for governor,'' he says, munching on
more popcorn.

GEORGE W. BUSH: POPULAR INCUMBENT CAN'T ESCAPE THE `P' WORD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 18)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA TOLLEY  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPLE, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush and company find themselves
in a rare downpour as they journey to this Central Texas town to
promote the Republican ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Republican candidates traveling with Bush are eager to be seen
with the popular governor. But the rain has dampened turnout, and
only about 50 people show up to greet them.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, ever the ice-breaker, is undaunted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to announce our drought relief plan is working,'' he
quips, and the crowd laughs its approval.
</P>
<P>
   They are off to a good start.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of hours later in Abilene, Bush is riding in a trolley
to the West Texas Fair and Rodeo when he spies a group of
motorcyclists parked at the entrance and asks the driver to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Grinning a crooked smile, he heads into the crowd and happily
shakes hands and poses for pictures with the bikers, who thank him
for supporting a repeal of the mandatory helmet law.
</P>
<P>
   Bush the candidate is affable and approachable. He easily makes
a joke and takes one as well. He makes ``Joe Q Citizen'' feel like
the only person in a crowded room, if just for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like my job here. I love Texas,'' he says one day.
</P>
<P>
   His easygoing style has served him well so far in his quest to
become the first governor re-elected to consecutive four-year terms
in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But as Bush talks about Texas, it seems Texans have something
else on their minds _ the presidential race in 2000. Bush is
confronted with the question at almost every stop.
</P>
<P>
   A placard in Abilene reads: ``Bush 4 President.'' Many people
who get their photos snapped with him boast that they had their
picture taken ``with the next president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   With the polls titling Bush's way and an awesome campaign fund
on hand, many Texans seem to think the governor's race is a
foregone conclusion. They want to know what Bush will do next and
when he's going to announce it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush insists he is focused solely on the Nov. 3 election and
won't make up his mind about a presidential bid until early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wasn't interested in running for president, I would've
said so,'' the governor said recently at a stop in San Antonio.
``And I told the truth nearly a year ago when I said I don't know
whether I will or will not run for the presidency _ and people are
going to have to factor that in when they get to the voting
booth.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, 52, is not sure if wants to commit his wife, Laura, and
twin 16-year-old girls ``to the Washington, D.C., lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is ever a time when Bush gets visibly emotional, it is
when he discusses his father's 1992 presidential campaign and the
agony he endured ``watching someone you love go down in flames.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that his own life was scrutinized when his father was in
office, and against during the 1994 race for governor, Bush says he
can pass another round of attention, should he decide to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was young and irresponsible, I was young and
irresponsible,'' he says, declining to provide any specifics except
that he drank too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Now) I'm a devoted father, a loyal husband and I've upheld
the integrity of this office.''
</P>
<P>
   His opponent, Democratic Land Commissioner Garry Mauro, has
criticized Bush for not giving Texans a definite answer on the
presidential question. Yet Bush's refusal to say one way or the
other doesn't seem to have hurt him politically.
</P>
<P>
   First things are first, and Bush has to get re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are campaigning like there's no tomorrow,'' Bush said at
the Temple stop. ``The only poll that matters is on Election Day.
All this talk about the polls makes me nervous. It's not over.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He speaks from experience. Four years ago, Bush was the underdog
who pulled off a shocker by beating another popular incumbent
governor, Democrat Ann Richards.
</P>
<P>
   Richards' loss has been blamed in part on her failure to lay out
a new agenda. In this campaign, Bush points to his record, but he
also has outlined plans for the next term.
</P>
<P>
   During his first legislative session, he says, he made good on
his campaign promises to reform welfare, toughen juvenile justice
laws, increase local control of schools and reform civil
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, complain that Bush took on a set of goals that
already were on the legislative radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1997 session, Bush wanted to cut school property
taxes by some $4 billion by shifting the tax burden to other areas.
Unable to persuade the Texas Senate _ where his own party holds a
majority _ to approve the deal, he had to settle for a $1 billion
tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   And there have been some controversial decisions he had to make
alone.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Bush refused to halt the execution of pick-ax
killer Karla Faye Tucker, despite pleas from supporters that she
deserved mercy because she had undergone a religious conversion and
was a changed woman. Bush refused to intervene, and she became the
first woman executed in Texas since the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, he commuted the death sentence of Henry Lee
Lucas, who had confessed to numerous murders but then recanted
almost all of them. Bush accepted the Board of Pardons and Paroles'
recommendation to commute Lucas' only death sentence because there
was no evidence linking him to the crime except his recanted
confession.
</P>
<P>
   If he is re-elected, Bush says, he will seek to lower school
property taxes by $2 billion by tapping some of the state's
anticipated $6 billion surplus. He also has proposed eliminating
the sales tax on over-the-counter medicines, suspending the sales
tax on some school items before classes start every year, and
exempting 176,000 small businesses from the state's franchise tax.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the nuts-and-bolts issues, Bush often talks about
ushering in ``a new era of responsibility.'' He urges young people
not to drink, abuse drugs or alcohol and to refrain from having sex
until they are married.
</P>
<P>
   Bush admits to drinking too much earlier in his life and says he
is glad he quit the day after his 40th birthday. He says it isn't
hypocritical for an ex-drinker to tell others not to use alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, did you learn from your mistakes? Are you a
grownup,'' Bush says. ``Yes, I am.''

IN SHORT TERM, THESE RESULTS ARE DISHEARTENING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am a conservative retiree, 69 years old. Attached is a
schedule of my investments, and I hope you can tell me if my broker
is giving me good advice and what changes, if any, I should make to
give me better, but safe, returns. I am not interested in the stock
market. I'm especially concerned about the Smith Barney Premium
Total Return fund, which the broker tells me is paying 4 percent,
but which rate doesn't show up on my monthly statement. As you can
see, the position lost $5,000 during the month of August. Also, the
Smith Barney Large Cap Blend fund looks suspicious, with only a .77
percent yield. The overall situation looks pretty good, with a
total funding of $430,282 in 1996, withdrawals of $56,662, and a
current balance remaining a credible $461,158. So the investments
must be doing something right.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  J.G., Vidor, Texas
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The reason you didn't see a yield figure for Smith Barney
Premium Total Return on your last statement is because it pays its
dividends quarterly, rather than monthly as do most of the
investments on this portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Your broker was probably right at the time you were told the
fund had a 4 percent return, although the figure had dropped to 3.4
percent by the time of the latest Morningstar Mutual Funds report.
That's still a high payout level for a stock fund, which this one
manages by maintaining a portfolio of companies with above-average
payouts, and also by habitually selling call-covered options. The
latter practice reduces the fund's upside potential in bull
markets, but it also reduces overall risk and increases income.
Morningstar rates it above-average, with a low risk score and
average returns.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on Smith Barney Large-Cap Blend (presuming you have
class B shares) is lower because of its more aggressive investment
stance.
</P>
<P>
   Lipper Analytical Services lists the 12-month yield at .92
percent in its Oct. 8 report, slightly below the 1.07 percent
average for growth and income funds. (Morningstar doesn't track
this fund.) Now, when you combine these two positions, they
represent 14.8 percent of the total portfolio, which is a pretty
small number for the typical investor of your age, but perhaps a
large number for a person who is not ``interested in the stock
market.'' All I can suggest is that such funds have doubtless
played a good part in the overall portfolio performance with which
you seem to be satisfied. Yes, both are in the red so far this
year, with Smith Barney Premium Total Return showing a negative
total return of 7.35 percent through Oct. 8, and with its Large-Cap
Blend fund off 12.36 percent in the same period. But think back to
last year, when Premium Total Return delivered 24.55 percent and
Smith Barney Large Cap Blend fund (then called Smith Barney Growth
and Income fund) returned 22.06 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously the short-term results from these two funds are
disheartening, but I suggest you view them as a small part of a
conservatively balanced portfolio and stick with them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I are ages 35 and 34 respectively. We have no
debt and rent a house and have joint annual income of approximately
$70,000 _ $35,000 each. I have a $50,000 CD at 5.34 percent, and my
wife has a $37,000 CD with the same terms. We would like to use
most of this money for a down payment on a house. We began IRAs in
January with 1997 contributions, and have switched them to Roth
accounts. Each has $2,000 in Vanguard Wellington, and for this year
we plan to put $2,000 each into Vanguard Balanced Index. We then
decided to take advantage of a 403(b) program offered through our
employer (we work at the same place). I'm not enthusiastic about
the plan, but it is tax deferred. I feel the charges _ management
fees, mortality fees and so forth _ are astronomical, but I don't
see any alternative. Do you have any suggestions for an
alternative? Our employer says it's the only plan. Couldn't we use
a Vanguard variable annuity and avoid at least the mortality fees?
We have both made the same investment choices, putting 50 percent
of our money in Fidelity Asset Manager and the rest in Fidelity
Equity Income. We each contribute 30 percent of our income. I
enclose the list of investment options; I realize that with our
time horizon being 30 years our allocations may seem a bit
conservative _ I was a bit nervous in January. Would you suggest a
different investment mix?

</P>
<P>
   A. To start with the idea of using a variable annuity instead of
a 403(b), the big problem is that while money that goes into a
variable annuity account grows on a tax-deferred basis, the
contributions come from after-tax income. The advantage of funding
retirement accounts with pretax dollars, as you are doing through
your 403(b) accounts, is substantial, and would outweigh the lower
fees associated with the variable annuities. All I can suggest is
that you continue to lobby your employer for a 403(b) plan with
better terms.
</P>
<P>
   On your investment choices, I do think you're being much too
conservative. You should think of these plans as 360-month
dollar-cost averaging programs, and thus be willing to disregard
the short-term condition of the market. Fidelity Asset Manager,
which typically holds about 40 percent of its portfolio in cash and
bonds, should prove a serious drag on your returns over the long
haul. Among the 17 options available to you is a stock index fund,
and it offers the highest historical returns of all of the options.
I suggest you move your entire Asset Manager balance and 50 percent
of ongoing contributions there. Since both the index fund and
Fidelity Equity Income fund focus on large-cap stocks, I would then
reduce that concentration a bit by cutting the Equity Income
contributions to 30 percent, putting 10 percent each in the Janus
Mid-Cap and T. Rowe Price Small-Cap Growth options.
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly true that a portfolio such as I suggest will be
more dangerous in bear markets, but the point is that you have a
very long time, and through your program of regular monthly
investments, you will be buying in markets high and low, and while
short-term risks in the market can be considerable, you have too
much time to do anything but take the more aggressive course.

LEXUS LX 470 FOR 1999 ADDRESSES PROBLEMS OF EARLIER MODEL
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by CARS-GLANCE) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Toyota needed a sport-utility vehicle to supplement its
line of Lexus luxury cars, it didn't have to look further than its
own Toyota Land Cruiser to come up with the full-size Lexus LX 450.
</P>
<P>
   There was some disappointment with the LX 450 among those
shopping for a large limousine-like SUV, however. The first problem
was the inline six-cylinder engine, which some shoppers found to be
a bit anemic for a 2 1/2-ton truck.
</P>
<P>
   Other problems included the tight middle seat, which wasn't as
comfortable as it should be in a vehicle that cost $50,000 and was
meant to be a luxury eight-passenger people-mover; and the Land
Cruiser/LX 450's ride, which was a bit too harsh for a vehicle in
this cushy-ride class.
</P>
<P>
   But all of those problems have been addressed with the all new
1999 Lexus LX 470, which made its debut earlier this year alongside
an all-new '99 Toyota Land Cruiser. The only components carried
over from the previous models are the four-speed automatic
transmission and the two-speed transmission transfer case for
low-range off-roading.
</P>
<P>
   The new LX 470 and Land Cruiser now are powered by a 4.7-liter
V-8 engine based on the 4.0-liter V-8 used in the Lexus LS 400
luxury sedan.
</P>
<P>
   Horsepower has increased from 212 with the previous six-cylinder
to 230 with the V-8, but more importantly, torque has improved
dramatically, from 275 foot-pounds with the six-cylinder to a
whopping 320 foot-pounds with the V-8.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important is the fact that 80 percent of that torque
is available at engine speeds as low as 1,100 rpm, which is
extremely important to get this heavy vehicle moving quickly off
the line.
</P>
<P>
   As heavy as it is, the LX 470 can accelerate from zero to 60 mph
in just 10 seconds, which is unmatched in the full-size SUV class.
Neither of the LX 470's two top rivals _ the Lincoln Navigator and
the Range Rover _ are quite that quick.
</P>
<P>
   The LX 470's ride is much smoother and softer than before, and
the vehicle doesn't lean in tight turns as dramatically as the LX
450 does. That's due in part to a new independent double-wishbone
front suspension system that uses lower torsion bars rather than
coil springs for better on-road performance, while allowing for
exceptionally long travel to handle uneven off-road surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Two high-tech additions also help give the LX 470 a limo-like
ride:
</P>
<P>
   _ An adjustable height control that sets the body at one of
three different levels from up high for the best off-road clearance
to down low for the best road-hugging performance. This doesn't
improve the ground clearance; it just raises or lowers the body on
the frame. At the lowest point, which is the setting most people
will use most of the time, the vehicle is low enough to the ground
for easy entry and exit. The highest level, for off-roading, works
only below 18 mph; it automatically switches to a lower setting
above that speed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Adaptive variable suspension, a fancy name for a
computer-controlled variable shock absorber system. This system has
driver-selectable ranges that control a computerized shock absorber
setup that can choose from among 64 different settings, from extra
cushy for bumpy roads to extra firm for interstate cruising.
Although the driver can set one of three ranges from soft to firm,
the computer does the work automatically after that, detecting road
surface and ride harshness and adjusting the shock absorber
firmness accordingly (as quickly as 2.5 milliseconds).
</P>
<P>
   The third seat row, which was best left to the kids before, is
even tighter now, thanks to extra room given to the middle seat.
You won't want to stick adults back there. In the new vehicle, the
third seat is easier to fold down or remove than before, and many
people will want to take it out for extra cargo space on trips if
it isn't needed for passengers.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   While most of the changes from the previous model have been good
ones for a luxury on-road SUV, there have been some trade-offs that
affect the LX 470's off-road performance.
</P>
<P>
   The Land Cruiser and LX 450 were arguably the best
stock-equipped off-road vehicles on the market, primarily because
of the suspension system that allowed for extra leaning (and
therefore better agility over rocks and logs), and a better
four-wheel-drive system.
</P>
<P>
   The basic full-time four-wheel drive of the older models
continues on the LX 470, minus two highly important features for
serious off-roading: the previously available locking front and
rear differentials. The LX 470 still has the locking center
differential, which forces power to both front and rear when
locked; but no locking front differential is offered and the
locking rear differential is available only on the Land Cruiser
version of this car.
</P>
<P>
   The LX 470 has only a limited-slip rear differential, which
isn't as effective in sand and mud as a locking mechanism. The
wheels, unfortunately, will slip when the going gets tough _
something you never had to worry about with the former models.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even though the LX 470 is still a capable off-road machine
in most situations, it no longer is the champ in the toughest
stuff; that crown goes to the Range Rover.
</P>
<P>
   But Lexus made these trade-offs knowing that most people won't
ever do any rough off-roading with the LX 470; its use will be
primarily as a luxury on-road, high-profile people mover, and in
that regard, it has no equal.
</P>
<P>
   Among the luxury fittings, which are almost identical to what
you get with the LS 400, are walnut interior trim, leather seats,
power-everything, heated outside mirrors (designed to dry up
raindrops as well as melt ice), separate front and rear automatic
climate control with smog sensor and air filter, premium 250-watt
AM/FM/cassette stereo with seven speakers and a six-disc in-dash
compact-disc player, cruise control, remote entry, lots of cup
holders, power tilt and telescopic steering column, and a
programmable garage-door opener.
</P>
<P>
   Off-roaders or anyone trying to park this big truck in a tight
space, like a parking garage, will appreciate the electric fold-in
exterior mirrors, controlled from a dashboard switch.
</P>
<P>
   Safety features include dual front air bags and four-wheel anti
lock brakes, which also work in low-range transmission mode. There
is a computerized control that decreases anti lock braking effort
at low off-road speeds for better driver control on steep slopes,
however; this was almost a requirement to keep the LX 470 up to
standards for off-roading.
</P>
<P>
   The base price of $54,950 (plus $495 transportation) brings
almost everything as standard equipment. The only options on ours
were a tilt-and-slide moon roof ($1,270), floor mats ($112), cargo
mat ($65), towing-hitch receiver with wiring harness ($264), and
roof luggage rack ($545).
</P>
<P>
   Total price, including transportation, was $57,701, which put
the LX 470 on par with the Range Rover 4.0 SE ($56,625), but well
below the Range Rover 4.6 HSE ($64,125). The LX 470 still is way
above the four-wheel-drive Lincoln Navigator's $43,300, however.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy estimates are 13 miles per gallon in the city
and 16 mpg on the highway, which is slightly better than the 13/15
with the LX 450's six-cylinder engine.
</P>
<P>
   The tank holds 25.4 gallons of gasoline; the vehicle can operate
on regular gas, but high-test is recommended.

CONVICTED KILLER MCDUFF MANIPULATED SYSTEM, LEFT HOMETOWN IN
TERROR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSEBUD, Texas _ He didn't just kill his victims, he savaged
them in unspeakable ways.
</P>
<P>
   He raped them with a measure of sadism that made grizzled cops
cringe. He blew their faces off at close range. He slashed and
stabbed with knives and bludgeoned with clubs and crushed their
necks with broom sticks.
</P>
<P>
   He preyed on the relatively defenseless. A couple of his victims
were young boys. Most were young women. ``Killing a woman's like
killing a chicken,'' he once told an accomplice. ``They both
squawk.''
</P>
<P>
   Tall, dour and icy-eyed, Kenneth Allen McDuff is the hometown
boy this small town southeast of Waco would like to forget, but
can't.
</P>
<P>
   He keeps coming back, usually in bad memories, sometimes in the
flesh, sometimes in chilling rumor. He's been scattering corpses
around Central Texas _ no one knows how many, but estimates have
ranged upwards of 15 _ since he was a teen-ager. He's now 52 and
still awaiting the ultimate punishment, still haunting his home
town.
</P>
<P>
   He is under two death sentences but may not live long enough to
be executed. His liver is being destroyed by Hepatitis C and
cirrhosis. But among his former neighbors, there are jittery
confessions of an irrational fear _ that somehow, McDuff, who has
slipped through the cracks of the judicial and penal systems with
mindboggling alacrity, will do it again and will come home once
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are actually afraid that he'll get out somehow and
come back here,'' said a retired schoolteacher who asked that her
name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really sad,'' said Glen Stock, a Rosebud, Texas, city
councilman and former classmate of McDuff's. ``It's been a long
time and he's still going on. He has worked the legal system better
than anybody I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Those fears were fueled by an unusual series of events in the
past three weeks. McDuff was scheduled to be executed Wednesday for
the murders of two young women in 1991 and 1992, crimes he
committed while on parole from a life sentence for a triple
homicide in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   The body of one of those women, Colleen Reed, had never been
found. Neither had the bodies of several others McDuff was believed
to have killed. As his execution neared, state and federal
appellate courts regularly were refusing to hear his case or were
ruling against him.
</P>
<P>
   Then, late in September, federal district judges in Austin and
Waco, Texas, granted stays of execution. Almost immediately, the
U.S. attorney's office and Texas Rangers, acting on information
from an informant they declined to identify, unearthed two of
McDuff's alleged victims in McLennan County near Waco. A third,
Colleen Reed, was found buried beside the Brazos River in a grassy
area that had been a popular fishing and partying spot for the
teen-agers of Rosebud when McDuff was growing up.
</P>
<P>
   No one here doubted that McDuff was the anonymous informant. Who
else could have pinpointed the bodies so precisely, they asked. An
electric rumor crackled on the streets: McDuff had come back in a
black limousine to point out the bodies. It was denied by lawmen,
but it was affirmation of what the townsfolk think McDuff is
capable of doing. At the least, they suspected he had made a deal:
the bodies in exchange for a little more time to beat the
executioner.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Johnston, the assistant U.S. attorney in Waco, said they
were wrong, but they were not persuaded. They knew Kenneth McDuff
too well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always did sort of what he wanted to,'' said James Hudson,
a banker who went to school with McDuff. ``If he got in trouble,
he'd run home and hide and his mother would bail him out.''
</P>
<P>
   His father was a cement contractor who worked hard and earned a
good living. The family lived in a two-story house, across the
street from a coin-operated laundry, which his mother ran when she
wasn't defending her son, which was often.
</P>
<P>
   Addie McDuff was known around town as ``Pistol-Packing Mama''
because she usually carried a .45 and, according to Rosebud legend,
once toted it to school to confront a teacher who had disciplined
Kenneth. Another story, passed around for decades, has it that she
used the gun to flag down and dress down a school bus driver who
had ejected her son for fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Though she had another son and four daughters, she doted on
Kenneth, a slow learner, who, by most accounts, began his criminal
career in the sixth grade and dropped out of school in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was overprotective and excused everything he did,'' said
the former teacher. ``He stole a billfold with $100 from a woman at
the Washateria. His mother argued with the woman and denied that
Kenneth took it. Well, the woman called the sheriff and Kenneth
handed over the billfold.''
</P>
<P>
   She dressed him in nice clothes, provided him a generous
allowance and made certain that in material possessions he was
always a step ahead of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us used to have these little motor scooters, the ones
with the small engines that you didn't have to have a license to
ride,'' said Stock. ``He had a Harley Davidson. He wasn't big
enough to kick-start it, so his brother would start it for him in
the morning so he could ride the two blocks to school. Then, he had
to push it home.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he drove new cars and wrecked them as fast as his mother
could pay for them, according to Mike Baca, another former
schoolmate. ``I don't know how many cars he tore up. He tore up so
many the Ford dealer quit selling to him,'' Baca grinned.
</P>
<P>
   Because he made no effort to succeed in school, he had been held
back and was older than the others in his class, and bigger. He
bullied, insulted them and took their lunch money. Until the eighth
grade when Tommy Sammon, a popular athlete, accepted his challenge
and met him in a drainage ditch after school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took about 30 seconds for Tommy to take care of him,'' Baca
said. ``Kenneth never bothered anybody again.''
</P>
<P>
   Except his teachers.
</P>
<P>
   In his sophomore year, the principal sent him home for
disrupting a class. His older brother, Lonnie, who had a speech
impediment and referred to himself as ``Wuff, tuff Wonnie McDuff,''
went to the school with a knife. While some students watched from
their classroom, he bounded up the stairs to where D.L. Mayo, a
college football All-American before he was a school principal, was
bending over a drinking fountain. Mayo saw Lonnie from the corner
of his eye, spun around, disarmed him, lifted him off his feet and
tossed him back down the stairs. Kenneth never returned to school.
</P>
<P>
   Many years later, Lonnie would be shot to death by the
ex-husband of his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1994, we were planning our 30-year class reunion,'' said
Stock. ``Most of us in that class have done pretty well, but
Kenneth's the only one who made national news. I suggested that we
invite him to be our speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   McDuff became as famous for cheating the system as for his
crimes. He wiggled out of arrests for burglary, theft or robbery
until, at the age of 18, he was nailed for a string of burglaries
in Falls, Bell and Milam counties in Texas. McDuff could have
received sentences totaling more than 50 years. He got four and was
out in 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   While on parole and working in his father's concrete business,
he and a running buddy named Roy Dale Green finished work one
Saturday night in the summer of 1966 and drove to Fort Worth
looking for action.
</P>
<P>
   At a baseball field, they spotted three teen-agers _ two boys
and a girl, ages 15, 16 and 17. McDuff took a .38 pistol from under
the seat of his car, the new Dodge Charger he received from his
mother when he was paroled, and robbed them.
</P>
<P>
   He ordered them into the trunk of their own car and drove it to
a field outside of town. Green followed in the Charger. McDuff took
the girl out of the trunk, shot the two boys twice in the face,
then lifted one of them by the hair and shot him again.
</P>
<P>
   Forcing the girl to undress, they drove her to another location
and repeatedly raped her. McDuff dragged the girl out of the car
and threw her naked into the middle of the road. While Green held
her legs, McDuff crushed her throat with a broomstick.
</P>
<P>
   For reporting the crimes and cooperating with the police, Green
got five years. McDuff was sentenced to die in the electric chair.
</P>
<P>
   Addie McDuff attended every day of the trial and refused to
accept her son's guilt. During one recess, she said Kenneth had
actually been with a girl from his church the night of the murders,
but was keeping quiet to protect her reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's too good for his own good,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it seemed that the courts and the prisons were as
protective of him as his mother had been. After six years on death
row, his sentence was commuted to life when the U.S. Supreme Court
banned capital punishment in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   That meant he could, one day, be paroled again and events
conspired to help him toward that goal. Federal court mandates to
ease prison overcrowding in the 1970s and 1980s created a
precipitous turnover in the prison population and McDuff tried to
speed his own release by offering a deal he thought a parole board
member couldn't refuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get me out of this pen,'' he told Glenn Heckman in
1981, ``I guarantee that $10,000 will be left in the glove
compartment of your car. My family's got the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Being convicted of bribery would have made him a three-time
loser under the habitual criminal act that existed then, and he
could have received another life sentence _ forestalling any
possibility of parole. Instead, a confused jury returned a two-year
sentence, which, in effect was no sentence at all. He had already
earned that much good time.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the pressures to thin the prison population led to
his release _ in late 1989 _ and he went back to Rosebud. Along the
relaxed streets of the community of 1,600, doors were suddenly kept
locked. Women who had once taken evening walks for exercise stayed
indoors. Some carried knives or large scissors on the front seats
of their cars.
</P>
<P>
   But McDuff didn't stay long. He accosted three young black men
in a park. He shouted a racial slur at them and chased them down an
alley with a knife. It was enough to cause his parole to be
revoked, but not enough to keep him behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Charges of ``making terroristic threats'' were not prosecuted
because the three victims were too frightened to testify. Two
months later, his parole was reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   He settled this time in Waco to attend a technical school and
almost immediately young women in the area _ many believed to be
prostitutes _ began disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   When he became a suspect, McDuff fled to Kansas City where he
was arrested after his picture appeared on the television show
``America's Most Wanted.'' He went back to prison under Texas' new
death penalty law.
</P>
<P>
   Though other charges were filed, only two were prosecuted _ the
murder of Melissa Northrup, a 22-year-old pregnant mother of two,
whom he abducted from a Waco convenience store, and that of Colleen
Reed, a 21-year-old accountant who was kidnapped from an Austin car
wash.
</P>
<P>
   When Reed's body and two others were found recently, there was
speculation that perhaps instead of a deal, Kenneth McDuff, facing
imminent death, had found his conscience and it drove him to
surrender the victims' remains.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Ranger Matt Cawthon laughed when he heard that theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is evil, evil incarnate,'' Cawthon said. ``The things he
did to other human beings were unconscionable.''
</P>
<P>
   His advice to Rosebud? Relax. Kenneth McDuff isn't coming home
again.
</P>
<P>
   A new execution date is set for Nov. 17. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wednesday night, a double-A list of the friends and
clients of Bertram Fields gathered at the ``21'' Club to offer
congratulations. Another legal victory for the swashbuckling
Hollywood attorney?
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. This time, Fields, who has done legal battle on
behalf of Tom Cruise, James Cameron, the Beatles and nearly every
major film studio, was being feted for a scholarly book in defense
of an altogether different client, Richard III.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who breezed in to pick up a free copy of ``Royal
Blood: Richard III and the Mystery of the Princes'' (Regan
Books/HarperCollins), which examines whether history unfairly
blames Shakespeare's scheming hunchback for killing his two
nephews, were Tina Brown, Mort Zuckerman and Lorne Michaels. Also
Barry Diller, Charlie Rose, Nora Ephron and Elaine May.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone swore that Fields' tome _ his third book, following two
steamy novels written under the pseudonym D. Kinkaid _ was bound
for the top of a bedside reading pile. ``I was drip-fed Shakespeare
at Oxford,'' said Ghislaine Maxwell, a daughter of the late media
kingpin Robert Maxwell, as she stuck her nose into the book's
binding. ``Just sniffing fresh ink gets me high.''
</P>
<P>
   Fields, who is rather regal-looking himself, with a healthy West
Coast glow, hovered by the mahogany bar, signing copies of the
book. A woman who said she bought five copies waited anxiously as
the author scribbled a warm salutation. Asked who she was after she
departed, Fields said, ``Gee, I can't remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Mario Puzo, sockless in a pair of tan Rockport loafers, sat in a
corner of the top-floor private room, chewing an increasingly
soggy, unlighted cigar. ``I don't want to offend anyone by lighting
up,'' he said. ``In my day, you got a bunch of writers together and
there would be at least one fist-fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The only raised voice was that of Fields' publisher, Judith
Regan, who vehemently criticized her absent husband, Robert
Kleinschmidt. The two have been mired in divorce proceedings since
1992. ``Next time we meet, it's going to be in criminal court, not
civil court,'' she assured Dominick Dunne, who simply nodded. ``And
believe me, I won't be so civil.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone said that, despite his reputation as an invincible
legal bulldog, Fields is really a pussycat. ``People have such a
negative view of lawyers these days, but Bert is different,''
insisted Suzie Schuster, a producer at ESPN. ``He's not smarmy _
he's a swami.''
</P>
<P>
   Fields said he wrote the book after his 97-year-old father, who
has never been impressed by his son's stunning legal prowess,
groused, ``When are you going to do something serious with your
life?''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Fields sat down to begin ``Royal Blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Over a dinner at ``21,'' Fields told a story about placing pages
of his hand-written manuscript on the roof of his car and driving
off. When he got to work, several months of effort had vanished in
the wind.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Barbara Guggenheim, tried to find the lost pages by
placing a soggy pile of newspapers on top of her car, retracing her
husband's route and stopping when the newspapers took flight. She
got the idea, she said, from the saga of Lorena Bobbitt, whose
husband's severed penis was found using a similar method.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police drove around throwing hot dogs out the window,''
Ms. Guggenheim said, over a plate of roasted foie gras. ``Anyway,
in the case of my husband, it didn't work.''

HOW TO CLEAN SEPTIC TANK PLUGGED WITH GREASE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. A cleaning of my septic tank revealed that drainage holes
were plugged with a hard, greasy substance, possibly from soap. Is
there a soap that would not create that buildup? Would a grease
remover be advisable?
</P>
<P>
   FRANK BERNARD, Spooner, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. A high-pressure stream from a hose when the tank is pumped
out should knock off those greasy buildups. There are several
things you can do to prevent their returning. Use a detergent, not
a soap, and do not put cooking fats and grease in the tank. A
grease remover is not recommended; such chemicals may dissolve
grease but can kill microorganisms essential to the operation of
the system.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing you should add to your system is baking soda,
which helps brings the sewage into the proper pH level (neutral,
neither acid nor base) to allow bacteria to digest the sewage. Pour
a cup of baking soda down any drain once a week. Nothing else is
needed to add to the system other than what normally goes into it
from drains in house.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am looking for closet poles that will span distances of
four to eight feet in several closets. I think wood would be too
light for the longer spans, even with a center support. What
material would be better: wood or metal?
</P>
<P>
   MIA LAEB, Jonesport, Maine
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Wood (1 1/2 to 2 inches in diameter) is good up to spans of
four to six feet. For longer spans, use a steel rod; you might need
a center support on an eight-foot span.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there a difference in the quality of outdoor light
fixtures, and how do you know the difference? Our four-year-old
house had all brass-plated outdoor fixtures, and all have lost the
shine, are etched and wretched looking. Some that were protected on
the front stoop also need replacing. Does anyone make a quality of
brass that resists the elements? How do you evaluate the quality? I
don't want to replace fixtures every three-four years.
</P>
<P>
   B. SPARKS, Somewhere in the U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You are the victim of the ``Save money in a house by
installing cheap fixtures and other accessories'' syndrome.
Contractors have to save money in building any house, and do it by
putting in cheap accessories; by the time they deteriorate, the
house is out of warranty and the owner is left holding the junk,
such as inferior lamps, bathroom fixtures, and hardware, and so-so
kitchen cabinetry. This junk, unfortunately, is within code.
</P>
<P>
   There are quality light fixtures at building supply and lighting
stores, all expensive. If you like brass, specify solid brass; you
can determine that by putting a magnet on the brass; if the magnet
does not stick, it is solid brass; if it sticks, it is brass
plated, something to avoid. Sometimes aluminum is brass plated,
another thing to avoid. But even solid brass will tarnish and
corrode; it is the nature of brass to do this, and outdoors it is
best left tarnished. Some brass is lacquered, to make it stay
shiny, but this does not work well outdoors, and when the lacquer
peels or wears off, the fixture looks worse than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Other quality fixtures are cast iron, black painted aluminum, or
copper, which will also corrode and turn to that familiar green
patina, which is good. Sometimes brass or aluminum is painted
black, which is also OK.
</P>
<P>
   Expect to pay anywhere from $60 or so to hundreds of dollars for
quality fixtures.

   Remember Attilio Ceraldi's question about a high-pitched hum in
his refrigerator? The handyman gave a long explanation of how to
reduce it by lining the refrigerator enclosure with acoustical
tiles.
</P>
<P>
   That might have helped, but Sharon Rogers (no town listed) wrote
to tell us what she did about her humming refrigerator. ``I had the
same problem, and a friend also had the problem with a fairly new
refrigerator. With both our refrigerators it turned out that the
drip pan was left loosely taped in place after delivery. Once the
drip pan was pulled out, the shipping tape removed, the pan cleaned
and put back into place, the noise stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a simple solution to a very annoying problem!''
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, Sharon Rogers.

   Q. Here's a question on a roof that has not been answered, so
far. I have lichen all over the roof. How can I remove it?
</P>
<P>
   H.S., North Andover
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Ah, lichen; or rather, my goodness, lichen! It is a
combination of a fungus and algae, is light green or gray, grows on
many surfaces and, in the handyman's experience, is virtually
impossible to remove. It is impervious to bleach. A wire brush
might remove it, but will also destroy the shingles. A reader once
wrote that she removed lichen with a bristle scrub brush, but that,
too, could ruin asphalt shingles.
</P>
<P>
   So, the handyman asks, is there anyone out there who knows how
to remove lichen safely from asphalt shingles? H.S. of North
Andover and the handyman would love to find out.

GRACE SLICK: STILL THE GROUSER AFTER ALL THESE YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 18)  
 (bl)  
 By ALEX WITCHEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Somehow the Palm Court at the Plaza Hotel, with its
harpist and doilied dessert plates, seems like the last place where
Grace Slick would want to meet. But here she comes, dressed mostly
in black, looking startlingly like herself even though the Feed
Your Head Queen of Jefferson Airplane, the voice that launched a
thousand trips with her 1960s anthem ``White Rabbit,'' turns 60
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from how good she looks, either she took far fewer drugs
than anyone imagined, or the cosmetics industry should start
marketing an LSD eye cream.
</P>
<P>
   She has the same tough-girl stance as always, striding unsmiling
through the center of the room wielding a black Guess bag. She
seems to make a point of carrying it so the word ``Guess'' faces
out.
</P>
<P>
   Why the Palm Court? ``I don't know New York too well,'' she
says, though she did spend a year at the now-defunct Finch College.
``I would fly in to do a job and fly back out. We would stay here
or at the Park Lane Hotel.'' Her husky voice takes on an I-dare-you
edge. ``All I know about the Plaza is their rooms are smaller than
the Park Lane, and Elaine, whatever that kid was, was at the
Plaza.''
</P>
<P>
   She looks for the shocked response to her garbling of Eloise;
when there is none, she seems a bit let down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also,'' she continues, ``the Plaza is across the street from
F.A.O. Schwarz.'' Why is that important? ``I collect stuffed
animals, and toy stores make me happy,'' she says. The edge goes,
and she smiles like a 6-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   In less than three minutes she has gone from jaded road tripper
to snide rule breaker to sweet child. You can see why Airplane
founder Marty Balin once said, ``Whoever slept with Grace had the
power in the band.'' Ms. Slick is a genuine endurance test.
</P>
<P>
   The real reason for her unlikely appearance here among the
teacups is to promote her autobiography, ``Somebody to Love: A
Rock-and-Roll Memoir,'' with Andrea Cagan (Warner Books).
</P>
<P>
   Retired from performing since 1989, Ms. Slick feels free to
spill some beans about the seamier side of peace, love and
pharmaceuticals. Along with Janis Joplin, she was a cultural icon
of the '60s. Unlike Joplin, she is alive and aging, the mother of a
27-year-old daughter, a veteran of two marriages and countless
relationships, and an admitted alcoholic who has struggled with
sobriety for the last 23 years. She has landed in jails and
hospitals for everything from drunken driving to assaulting an
officer to wielding a shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   But as always with Ms. Slick, though she writes about details
sure to fascinate die-hard boomers (Mick Jagger's furniture was
Louis XIV; sex with Jim Morrison was swell), the power is in the
performance. In person, she seems more complex than on the page.
What's most interesting is not the ancient history, but her sense
of self in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Born to an investment banker and his Mayflower-descendant wife,
Grace Wing (an Anglicization of the Norwegian name Vinje) grew up
mostly in Palo Alto, Calif. She married a neighbor, Jerry Slick,
with whom she founded her first band, the Great Society, and gained
recognition on the San Francisco music scene.
</P>
<P>
   She was soon recruited by Jefferson Airplane and made her name
nationally as the bad girl incarnate, beautiful and dangerous, a
rebel with a cause, who delighted in creating social upheaval.
(When her daughter, by her fellow band member Paul Kantner, was
born, she put ``god'' on the birth certificate. Her real name is
China).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Slick has no interest now in reinventing herself as a
singer. She knows that she defines the '60s, but she does not want
the '60s to define her.
</P>
<P>
   ``You either evolve or you don't,'' she says flatly. ``I don't
like old people on a rock-and-roll stage. I think they look
pathetic, me included. And the fact that I represent an era means I
can't just go out there and do all new stuff. They would all say,
`Sing ``White Rabbit,'' ' and I'd say no? That's rude. But can you
see me singing `Feed your head' as a practicing nonalcoholic? It
doesn't make sense now.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Ms. Slick tends to stress her identification with the
'60s, she tends to downplay the fact that she is equally a product
of her privileged '50s upbringing. Despite her deriding Finch as a
finishing school where she learned things like ``how to use a
finger bowl (don't drink it),'' its effects are ingrained. She sits
at the Palm Court for two hours, and though she neither eats nor
drinks, she unfolds her napkin and places it on her lap. When she
frets over a ragged fingernail, she pulls a nail file from her
purse (where she keeps her makeup in a plastic Ziploc bag) and
looks guiltily over her shoulder. ``Is this cheesy, doing this
here?'' she asks. ``It's my Episcopalian upbringing not to do this
at the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she catches herself, and her tone changes. ``I was doing a
TV interview recently, and the hairdresser said, `Let's poof this
hair up a little bit.' And I said: `I don't do poofs, honey. I'm
not the poofy type.''' As her hair stays resolutely '60s, long and
straight, so does her outfit. Though she calls the black matte
pants she is wearing ``boot cut tights,'' they look an awful lot
like bell-bottoms. And while the silver ornament around her neck
looks like a cross, she insists it is a Celtic arrow. ``I'm more
inclined to wear weapons,'' she declares.
</P>
<P>
   OK, OK. If she never sings ``White Rabbit'' again, it is clear
that the renegade image she has so carefully cultivated will not go
gently into the night. Maybe that's because she's famous for it, or
maybe it's because that's who she is.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, she writes, her parents dubbed her ``The Grouser.''
To this day, nothing seems to please her as much as devising any
variation on the word ``no.'' And her dismissal of fame and its
trappings (her own doesn't count somehow), her disdain for the
hordes climbing the corporate ladder or inching their way up the
country-club food chain, is as staunch as ever.
</P>
<P>
   She spends most of her time now at her home in Malibu, Calif.
(her Marin County house was destroyed by fire in 1993), drawing and
making jewelry out of hardware. ``I do what I love to do, what I
choose to do,'' she says defiantly. ``I find it amusing on one
level, poignant on another, when people try to get recognition from
an outside source. It's sad.''

A SOGGY SAGA OF HERSHEY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HERSHEY, Pa. _ Sometimes life is just a wash-out. First it was
the annual International Motor Press Association Test Day that got
rained out at Pocono Raceway in Pennsylvania's eastern hills _
barely time to look at a couple of vehicles. Then it was the annual
Hershey regional meet of the Antique Automobile Club of America, a
monster auto show and flea market on the grounds of Hershey Foods
Co. (the folks who make the cocoa and candy bars) where the
monsoons struck.
</P>
<P>
   To the regulars in the old-car hobby who flock here every
October, the event is simply known as ``Hershey.'' It is difficult
to comprehend the immensity of this rite of autumn where Hershey
Park, a vast complex of stadium, amusement park, factory store, and
even vaster grassy fields separated by roads is turned into a tent
city of 28,000 souls overnight. Suddenly this pretty little company
town is home to a sprawling refugee camp cum junkyard wherein you
may find parts for obscure autos, whole vehicles, automobilia, and
such diverse offerings as musical instruments, boats, pedal cars,
cameras, lamps, gas pumps, an occasional boat _ once an airplane.
It was reliably reported that 10,225 vendor spots were rented, each
with a 10-foot frontage on a ``street,'' usually a grassy path. All
in a row, that would be 19.36 miles of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   It used to start on Wednesday; now the setup begins on Monday
and the wheeling and dealing continues through Saturday, the day of
the huge antique car show in the stadium parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional beginning for many of us is the Wednesday night
gathering of writers, collectors, publishers, editors, and auto
industry types at Harry's Tavern, a neighborhood establishment in,
to put it kindly, a rundown section of Harrisburg. A thinking
person wouldn't go there without police escort _ a lot of the
residents seem to have frequent police escorts of the custodial
type. Yet in 25 years of this tradition, nothing untoward has
happened _ except to Harry's, which has changed hands a couple of
times largely because of the robbery rate.
</P>
<P>
   Once, when Harry's was between administrations, so to speak, the
group switched to a hotel in Hummelstown. This Wednesday, a call to
Harry's elicits the information that the telephone has been
disconnected _ ``no further information.'' Harry's is kaput. John
Lawlor of WBZ and NPR has joined me this year, his first trip,
primed for Harry's; in disappointment, we head for Hummels-town _
eventually 15 of the group, most of whom have found Harry's boarded
up, home in on Hummels-town for the tradition. There is joy in
mudville again _ and the steaks are better here. But it's raining.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning we hitch a ride with a vendor to the Green
Field, a major duchy in the flea market empire, and begin trudging
the lanes in search of ... in my case a column or two. I find a
couple of battered baritone horns, a trombone, and a three-bell
bugle among the oddities. The Eastwood tent is busy where John
``The Bankman'' is eyeballing the miniature truck banks. But most
everything is buttoned up against the downpour. Even with
umbrellas, we are soaked.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, we head for the car corral where hundreds of
antique cars are on view, on sale _ a better show than the
scheduled show. At least it's paved; the grassy paths are now
sticky, sodden, clay morasses. Here I find an appropriate vehicle,
a 1964 Amphicar, apparently in very good condition (19K miles,
$15,500). I wander back to the Green Field, soaked, then discover
my notebook is in a pocket full of water, now blue-stained mush _ I
should have heeded the advice of the late Doug Crocket and brought
a pencil.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the rain continues and the White Field is virtually
impassable, but business is booming anyway _ desperation has set
in. The dealers in paper goods are suffering. The price of plastic
ponchos, $1.50 yesterday, has inched up to $3.50 today. Today I
bring the van, the Honda Odyssey, with a change of clothes for the
Society of Auto Historians' dinner in the evening and slog the
Chocolate Field in search of copy. I talk to people selling things
but nothing really odd, such as last year's phony Stradivarius or
the hearse trader. Lawlor is eyeing a Cadillac, laboring under a
pile of stuff for his grandchildren. In the afternoon, sopping wet,
boots caked with mud the consistency of hardened concrete, I head
for the van parked in a field a mile away. The field is a soggy
mess; hours later I arrive at the dinner site much too late to
participate.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, it is back with the van, drop Lawlor at the Harrisburg
airport, then back to Hershey to find a parking spot _ that field
again. Here, slicker-clad traffic directors with official airport
batons direct the Honda into a hog wallow, certain to mire it until
spring. They push, they grunt, finally announce they will send for
a tractor, and move off to direct others into the mud. I wait,
listening to the radio; in a half hour the wheels are dry, the mud
is caked, and I ease the Odyssey into reverse, gently move it until
it slips, then brake the wheels to a complete stop, ease into
first. After three or four repeats of this, the Odyssey finds firm
ground and I head for a parking spot. The baton man is in front of
me again, wig-wagging me toward what looks like another wallow. I
am going to park where he is standing and, when he finally figures
that out, he has barely time to leap out of my way.
</P>
<P>
   At the stadium auto show, many slots are vacant; the
participants and their cars are mired somewhere in the fields. But
it is a wonderful array of old iron nonetheless. I gravitate to
where a crowd has gathered to find a familiar face, Frank Hix of
Estes Park, Colo., explaining the charms of steam power as the
onlookers admire his 1916 Stanley Roadster.
</P>
<P>
   The rain has let up and area farmers are busy supplying tractor
power to free vendor vehicles from the grip of Hershey mud. So far
all I have accomplished today is a bad lunch and wet feet. I head
home.
</P>
<P>
   It is 12:30 a.m. Sunday, raining, on Route 290 in Worcester, and
I find out how good the Odyssey really is when a young woman in a
Detroit barge slides into my lane doing about 80. I avoid her but
the Chevy in front of me isn't so lucky. She hits it twice, caroms
over to the retaining wall, blows a tire and grinds off the other
side of the car on the wall, bounces back onto the road _ and hits
the gas. Twice more she nails the Chevy, then spins in front of it,
back up the other side and she's heading for me again. She has hit
everything but the brakes. The Odyssey responds, everybody parks.
The woman is distraught, the Chevy owner furious, the State Police
quick to arrive and take charge.
</P>
<P>
   I am home two hours later _ wide awake, contemplating my
problem: How does one explain ``washout'' to his editor while
submitting an expense account?

 NEW YORK: It's sad.''

<P>
   Does that mean she doesn't care that her book has received some
negative reviews? She nods. ``It's going to be that way with
anything you do. Some people aren't going to like it. Hopefully. I
mean, what if everybody liked it? You would have fallen into some
strange pocket. The word `success' _ who's defining it? It's about
whether or not it makes ME feel good. Four billion people don't
have to see or hear it. If I've enjoyed the process of creation and
I'm at peace, then what happens next is just entertainment. If mass
appeal were actually something, Marilyn Monroe wouldn't be dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Applause is interesting,'' she goes on, ``but I'm a monster
with or without it. Something is either well written or it isn't.
`White Rabbit' is not well written, and no amount of applause or
royalties can convince me it is. I could have done a better job
with those lyrics. They didn't say what I wanted. And there are
other songs I wrote that never got on with Airplane that are
fabulous. The whole public thing does not make up who I think I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm responsible. I show up, pay the bills. I've never bounced
a check, never slapped China around. A friend of mine used to
listen to Airplane and figured he could just take drugs and plop
through life. He heard what we were saying and misinterpreted it.
On your day off you could get weird, but you can't just go loony
tunes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Slick's parents died in the mid 1980s. Were they simply
horrified by her? She shakes her head and smiles. ``They were
relatively conservative,'' she says, ``but they both had good
senses of humor _ wry and sarcastic. They appreciated the fact I
was doing something I liked and making money at it. But the drugs
and getting arrested and all the wacko stuff, they were worried
about. `Oh, Grace, why do you have to do those drugs or yell at the
police?' '' she says, assuming what seems to be her mother's voice.
`` `Don't yell. It's not tasteful.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, one entertainment I've always had is to watch people
lose their minds over something that is totally unimportant. If I
stand up now and say, `Happy birthday,' here in the Plaza, everyone
would turn around and say, `That's nice.' But if I stood up and
cursed, they wouldn't. Neither one has anything to do with their
lives, and it just amuses me to watch how poorly we're taught.''
She leans forward. ``I won't do it,'' she says, ``but if I was
drunk, I might.''
</P>
<P>
   The waiter arrives to take a lunch order, but Ms. Slick demurs.
In the last few years she has developed a medical condition that
makes her feet feel as if they'd been plunged into boiling water.
It is aggravated by hot weather and by eating, which raises her
body temperature.
</P>
<P>
   One consolation is her improved relationship with her daughter.
In interviews past, China Kantner, an actress, has volubly
complained about having a mother who refused to give up her touring
career to stay home with her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Slick nods, almost wearily. ``I'm sure that China might have
at some point preferred that both her father and mother were home
more often,'' she says. ``And she might have preferred I was less
distant, figuratively as well as literally. I'm not a big Italian
mama. I don't communicate that way.''
</P>
<P>
   She looks surprised by her own candor. She rallies. ``I'm not
interested in having people touch me unless they want to have sex
with me. I like the Japanese method of bowing. I'm Norwegian, what
do you expect?'' She sighs. ``All kids realize at some point that
they have to get off the fact that their parents aren't something
or are something.''
</P>
<P>
   Like her mother, China Kantner has abused alcohol since she was
a teen-ager. ``She's sober awhile,'' Ms. Slick says, ``then thinks
it would be fun and goes back. It's the same pattern as Mom.
Hopefully we both can manage it this time out. For me, it's getting
so that the drama is not so interesting anymore. It's too much
trouble. Maybe I'm getting lazy.''
</P>
<P>
   What is she doing instead? ``I'm doing what I did when I was a
kid,'' she says, ``listening to music, drawing, reading, hanging
out with a few friends. I guess I'm going into the final drooling
round-blob stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Abruptly, she turns the conversation toward death. ``I want more
life,'' she says. ``I think its really rude to be cut off in
midcontinuity. If I died now, I wouldn't find out if they impeach
Clinton or who China marries. Death is like taking an intermission
when you can't come back. I like living and being around. But there
might also be another level that's really fascinating. I think of
myself as a positive agnostic. I don't know, therefore I'm open. I
don't know, therefore I'm interested.''
</P>
<P>
   She hears herself, and crosses her arms. Selling a book is one
thing; baring your soul to the sellout press is another. She waits
for the next question, and when it comes, gloats at the softball.
</P>
<P>
   Is there anything in her life that she wants, but doesn't have?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' she says, grinning. ``A flat stomach. I'm easy to
please.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The roster of value players at Franklin Mutual Advisers will
remain the same after the chief executive officer, Michael Price,
gives up his management duties next month, but they will be getting
new positions. Specifically, the senior analysts who have long
executed the Mutual Series team-based investing have been named as
managers and co-managers of the individual funds.
</P>
<P>
   The new lineup at the $26 billion fund group is as follows. Ray
Garea, a senior analyst, will run Mutual Qualified, helped by the
assistant manager, Jeff Diamond. Larry Sondike, also a senior
analyst, will be co-manager for Mutual Beacon and Mutual Shares,
the first with David Winters, and the latter with David Marcus,
both senior analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual Discovery, which invests in smaller companies globally,
will have as co-managers Robert Friedman and Marcus, who will also
take sole stewardship of Mutual European. Finally, Garea will also
manage Mutual Financial with an assistant manager, Jim Agah. All
the managers will be supervised by Friedman, who becomes chief
investment officer in November.
</P>
<P>
   What does this mean for investors? The three biggest and oldest
funds, Beacon, Shares and Qualified _ which have long been managed
as virtual clones, with the analysts spreading their ideas among
them _ are likely to develop differences, say outside analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach answers the funds' need for micromanagement,
according to Peter Langerman, who becomes the chief executive in
November. ( Price sold his fund company to Franklin Resources two
years ago and in July announced his plans to relinquish management
duties.) ``When you have hundreds of stocks in a fund, they have to
be watched as closely as the bigger positions,'' Langerman said.
The three funds hold roughly 300 stocks each. ``This is an attempt
to have portfolio managers focus on a particular fund, as opposed
to running money as a large pool,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As of June 30, the three funds shared 7 of their 10 largest
stock holdings. They are Chase Manhattan, Investor A.B., Media One,
General Motors, Railtrack, Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux and Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter. The funds have lagged behind their peers this
year, largely because of their investment in Sunbeam.
</P>
<P>
   The fund company says such cross-fertilization will not change.
``We still expect the largest positions to be reflected across the
board in all the funds,'' Langerman said. ``A good value idea is a
good value idea, and everyone wants to participate.''
</P>
<P>
   But the new structure may address a common criticism of the
funds, said Susan Belden, editor of No-Load Fund Analyst, an
investing newsletter. ``Now they can say they've split up the large
pool of money, and it's being managed by different people,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   How can investors distinguish among the three domestic large-cap
offerings? Langerman and Friedman offered these guidelines:
Qualified holds a bigger range of large- and mid-cap stocks; Beacon
has the biggest chunk of foreign issues, at 35 percent, plus
large-cap stocks, and Shares holds the smallest portion of foreign
issues, 15 percent, and focuses on large-cap, not mid-cap, stocks.

CONVICTED KILLER MCDUFF MANIPULATED SYSTEM, LEFT HOMETOWN IN
TERROR 
 
EDITORS, PLEASE NOTE: FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 18 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSEBUD, Texas _ He didn't just kill his victims, he savaged
them in unspeakable ways.
</P>
<P>
   He raped them with a measure of sadism that made grizzled cops
cringe. He blew their faces off at close range. He slashed and
stabbed with knives and bludgeoned with clubs and crushed their
necks with broom sticks.
</P>
<P>
   He preyed on the relatively defenseless. A couple of his victims
were young boys. Most were young women. ``Killing a woman's like
killing a chicken,'' he once told an accomplice. ``They both
squawk.''
</P>
<P>
   Tall, dour and icy-eyed, Kenneth Allen McDuff is the hometown
boy this small town southeast of Waco would like to forget, but
can't.
</P>
<P>
   He keeps coming back, usually in bad memories, sometimes in the
flesh, sometimes in chilling rumor. He's been scattering corpses
around Central Texas _ no one knows how many, but estimates have
ranged upwards of 15 _ since he was a teen-ager. He's now 52 and
still awaiting the ultimate punishment, still haunting his home
town.
</P>
<P>
   He is under two death sentences but may not live long enough to
be executed. His liver is being destroyed by Hepatitis C and
cirrhosis. But among his former neighbors, there are jittery
confessions of an irrational fear _ that somehow, McDuff, who has
slipped through the cracks of the judicial and penal systems with
mindboggling alacrity, will do it again and will come home once
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are actually afraid that he'll get out somehow and
come back here,'' said a retired schoolteacher who asked that her
name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really sad,'' said Glen Stock, a Rosebud, Texas, city
councilman and former classmate of McDuff's. ``It's been a long
time and he's still going on. He has worked the legal system better
than anybody I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Those fears were fueled by an unusual series of events in the
past three weeks. McDuff was scheduled to be executed Wednesday for
the murders of two young women in 1991 and 1992, crimes he
committed while on parole from a life sentence for a triple
homicide in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   The body of one of those women, Colleen Reed, had never been
found. Neither had the bodies of several others McDuff was believed
to have killed. As his execution neared, state and federal
appellate courts regularly were refusing to hear his case or were
ruling against him.
</P>
<P>
   Then, late in September, federal district judges in Austin and
Waco, Texas, granted stays of execution. Almost immediately, the
U.S. attorney's office and Texas Rangers, acting on information
from an informant they declined to identify, unearthed two of
McDuff's alleged victims in McLennan County near Waco. A third,
Colleen Reed, was found buried beside the Brazos River in a grassy
area that had been a popular fishing and partying spot for the
teen-agers of Rosebud when McDuff was growing up.
</P>
<P>
   No one here doubted that McDuff was the anonymous informant. Who
else could have pinpointed the bodies so precisely, they asked. An
electric rumor crackled on the streets: McDuff had come back in a
black limousine to point out the bodies. It was denied by lawmen,
but it was affirmation of what the townsfolk think McDuff is
capable of doing. At the least, they suspected he had made a deal:
the bodies in exchange for a little more time to beat the
executioner.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Johnston, the assistant U.S. attorney in Waco, said they
were wrong, but they were not persuaded. They knew Kenneth McDuff
too well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always did sort of what he wanted to,'' said James Hudson,
a banker who went to school with McDuff. ``If he got in trouble,
he'd run home and hide and his mother would bail him out.''
</P>
<P>
   His father was a cement contractor who worked hard and earned a
good living. The family lived in a two-story house, across the
street from a coin-operated laundry, which his mother ran when she
wasn't defending her son, which was often.
</P>
<P>
   Addie McDuff was known around town as ``Pistol-Packing Mama''
because she usually carried a .45 and, according to Rosebud legend,
once toted it to school to confront a teacher who had disciplined
Kenneth. Another story, passed around for decades, has it that she
used the gun to flag down and dress down a school bus driver who
had ejected her son for fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Though she had another son and four daughters, she doted on
Kenneth, a slow learner, who, by most accounts, began his criminal
career in the sixth grade and dropped out of school in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was overprotective and excused everything he did,'' said
the former teacher. ``He stole a billfold with $100 from a woman at
the Washateria. His mother argued with the woman and denied that
Kenneth took it. Well, the woman called the sheriff and Kenneth
handed over the billfold.''
</P>
<P>
   She dressed him in nice clothes, provided him a generous
allowance and made certain that in material possessions he was
always a step ahead of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us used to have these little motor scooters, the ones
with the small engines that you didn't have to have a license to
ride,'' said Stock. ``He had a Harley Davidson. He wasn't big
enough to kick-start it, so his brother would start it for him in
the morning so he could ride the two blocks to school. Then, he had
to push it home.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he drove new cars and wrecked them as fast as his mother
could pay for them, according to Mike Baca, another former
schoolmate. ``I don't know how many cars he tore up. He tore up so
many the Ford dealer quit selling to him,'' Baca grinned.
</P>
<P>
   Because he made no effort to succeed in school, he had been held
back and was older than the others in his class, and bigger. He
bullied, insulted them and took their lunch money. Until the eighth
grade when Tommy Sammon, a popular athlete, accepted his challenge
and met him in a drainage ditch after school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took about 30 seconds for Tommy to take care of him,'' Baca
said. ``Kenneth never bothered anybody again.''
</P>
<P>
   Except his teachers.
</P>
<P>
   In his sophomore year, the principal sent him home for
disrupting a class. His older brother, Lonnie, who had a speech
impediment and referred to himself as ``Wuff, tuff Wonnie McDuff,''
went to the school with a knife. While some students watched from
their classroom, he bounded up the stairs to where D.L. Mayo, a
college football All-American before he was a school principal, was
bending over a drinking fountain. Mayo saw Lonnie from the corner
of his eye, spun around, disarmed him, lifted him off his feet and
tossed him back down the stairs. Kenneth never returned to school.
</P>
<P>
   Many years later, Lonnie would be shot to death by the
ex-husband of his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1994, we were planning our 30-year class reunion,'' said
Stock. ``Most of us in that class have done pretty well, but
Kenneth's the only one who made national news. I suggested that we
invite him to be our speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   McDuff became as famous for cheating the system as for his
crimes. He wiggled out of arrests for burglary, theft or robbery
until, at the age of 18, he was nailed for a string of burglaries
in Falls, Bell and Milam counties in Texas. McDuff could have
received sentences totaling more than 50 years. He got four and was
out in 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   While on parole and working in his father's concrete business,
he and a running buddy named Roy Dale Green finished work one
Saturday night in the summer of 1966 and drove to Fort Worth
looking for action.
</P>
<P>
   At a baseball field, they spotted three teen-agers _ two boys
and a girl, ages 15, 16 and 17. McDuff took a .38 pistol from under
the seat of his car, the new Dodge Charger he received from his
mother when he was paroled, and robbed them.
</P>
<P>
   He ordered them into the trunk of their own car and drove it to
a field outside of town. Green followed in the Charger. McDuff took
the girl out of the trunk, shot the two boys twice in the face,
then lifted one of them by the hair and shot him again.
</P>
<P>
   Forcing the girl to undress, they drove her to another location
and repeatedly raped her. McDuff dragged the girl out of the car
and threw her naked into the middle of the road. While Green held
her legs, McDuff crushed her throat with a broomstick.
</P>
<P>
   For reporting the crimes and cooperating with the police, Green
got five years. McDuff was sentenced to die in the electric chair.
</P>
<P>
   Addie McDuff attended every day of the trial and refused to
accept her son's guilt. During one recess, she said Kenneth had
actually been with a girl from his church the night of the murders,
but was keeping quiet to protect her reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's too good for his own good,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it seemed that the courts and the prisons were as
protective of him as his mother had been. After six years on death
row, his sentence was commuted to life when the U.S. Supreme Court
banned capital punishment in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   That meant he could, one day, be paroled again and events
conspired to help him toward that goal. Federal court mandates to
ease prison overcrowding in the 1970s and 1980s created a
precipitous turnover in the prison population and McDuff tried to
speed his own release by offering a deal he thought a parole board
member couldn't refuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get me out of this pen,'' he told Glenn Heckman in
1981, ``I guarantee that $10,000 will be left in the glove
compartment of your car. My family's got the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Being convicted of bribery would have made him a three-time
loser under the habitual criminal act that existed then, and he
could have received another life sentence _ forestalling any
possibility of parole. Instead, a confused jury returned a two-year
sentence, which, in effect was no sentence at all. He had already
earned that much good time.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the pressures to thin the prison population led to
his release _ in late 1989 _ and he went back to Rosebud. Along the
relaxed streets of the community of 1,600, doors were suddenly kept
locked. Women who had once taken evening walks for exercise stayed
indoors. Some carried knives or large scissors on the front seats
of their cars.
</P>
<P>
   But McDuff didn't stay long. He accosted three young black men
in a park. He shouted a racial slur at them and chased them down an
alley with a knife. It was enough to cause his parole to be
revoked, but not enough to keep him behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Charges of ``making terroristic threats'' were not prosecuted
because the three victims were too frightened to testify. Two
months later, his parole was reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   He settled this time in Waco to attend a technical school and
almost immediately young women in the area _ many believed to be
prostitutes _ began disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   When he became a suspect, McDuff fled to Kansas City where he
was arrested after his picture appeared on the television show
``America's Most Wanted.'' He went back to prison under Texas' new
death penalty law.
</P>
<P>
   Though other charges were filed, only two were prosecuted _ the
murder of Melissa Northrup, a 22-year-old pregnant mother of two,
whom he abducted from a Waco convenience store, and that of Colleen
Reed, a 21-year-old accountant who was kidnapped from an Austin car
wash.
</P>
<P>
   When Reed's body and two others were found recently, there was
speculation that perhaps instead of a deal, Kenneth McDuff, facing
imminent death, had found his conscience and it drove him to
surrender the victims' remains.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Ranger Matt Cawthon laughed when he heard that theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is evil, evil incarnate,'' Cawthon said. ``The things he
did to other human beings were unconscionable.''
</P>
<P>
   His advice to Rosebud? Relax. Kenneth McDuff isn't coming home
again.
</P>
<P>
   A new execution date is set for Nov. 17. &QL;

 &HT;    MICROSOFT JUDGE REGARDED AS TOUGH BUT FAIR

 &HT;    A black and white file photo of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Last December, when Microsoft Corp. insisted that
the Windows 95 operating system wouldn't work without its Internet
browser, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson decided to
find out for himself.
</P>
<P>
   With help from a courtroom technician, the judge was able to
``uninstall'' his own Explorer Internet browser in about 90
seconds. With that, Jackson ordered the software giant to begin
selling Windows 95 separate from its browser.
</P>
<P>
   While that order was overturned on appeal _ leading eventually
to the new Justice Department suit against Microsoft based on the
Windows 98 software that goes to trial Monday _ Jackson's dive into
the technical aspects of the case is indicative of his approach to
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom calls it like he sees it,'' says James Schaller, his
former law partner at Jackson &AMP; Campbell in Washington. ``That's
his signature. Most people respect him for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, 61, will be presiding over what has been billed as the
antitrust lawsuit of the decade. The suit pits the Justice
Department and the attorneys general of 20 states against
Microsoft, the world's leading software company. At issue: Whether
Microsoft has used its dominance in the market for personal
computer operating systems to stifle competition in application
markets such as Internet browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is no newcomer to the national spotlight. The burly
white-haired judge was appointed to the bench in 1982 by President
Reagan. In 1991, he sent Washington Mayor Marion Barry to jail for
cocaine possession. Three years later, he ordered former Sen. Bob
Packwood, R-Ore., to turn over sex-filled diary entries to a Senate
Ethics Committee. And last year, he fined Reagan's former aide
Michael Deaver $100,000 for lying about lobbying activities.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's Washington roots run deep. He grew up in the city's
affluent suburbs, attending the exclusive St. Alban's School. He
sang for the Washington Cathedral Choir.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to Dartmouth College. Upon graduation, he joined the
U.S. Navy as a line officer, spending three years aboard a
destroyer in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. He returned to Harvard
University Law School, graduating in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Washington, Jackson worked with his father, Thomas
Searing Jackson, a well-known Washington lawyer, at a predecessor
firm to Jackson &AMP; Campbell. The father of two grown daughters, he
loves sailing and spends weekends in St. Mary's County, Md.
</P>
<P>
   In the hallways of the U.S. District Court, prosecutors and
defense attorneys say Jackson is an affable, able judge who runs a
tight ship. A former litigator, he's considerate of the time
pressures on overworked lawyers. Also, he's been known to show
compassion for those sentenced. One defense attorney recalls
Jackson using flexibility in sentencing a former military medic who
served in Panama. The reason: The man had served his country during
war without a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Jackson is not without critics. The gossipy
Washingtonian magazine lambasted him in 1996, calling him one of
Washington's worst lawyers. In 1995, the trade publication Legal
Times took him to task for moving slowly and calling long lunch
breaks. A 1993 Legal Times analysis, however, showed that his
reversal rate was about 18 percent. And former clerks describe the
judge as a warm, mentoring boss who takes a personal interest in
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   No one denies he has a tough side. Jackson repeatedly has gone
head-to-head with Microsoft. Following the browser incident, he
threatened the company's lawyers with contempt sanctions because he
said they defamed a court-appointed expert, Lawrence Lessig. Lessig
is no longer serving as the court's special master in the Microsoft
case.
</P>
<P>
   In the trial, Jackson is expected to show his signature
tenacity, digging deep into the technical merits of the case. He's
unlikely to stray beyond established law.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very fair,'' said Michael Volkov, an assistant U.S.
Attorney in Washington. ``But he'll enjoy a hard-fought trial.''

JOHN KENNETH GALBRAITH: A VOICE WORTH HEEDING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ For John Kenneth Galbraith, this life has
been a 90-year run of merry adventure and diligent, breezily
intellectual reflection.
</P>
<P>
   What he has stood for is a staunch, historically derived,
politically battle-tested and cleverly argued liberalism. His
liberalism realistically appraises human nature, rigorously defends
legitimate aspirations, and gleefully attacks the greedy cant spun
off like mud from the spinning wheels of runaway capitalism. You
simply cannot argue political economy and fail to take Galbraith
into account.
</P>
<P>
   The birthday of Harvard's famous and prolific professor was
celebrated Thursday night at the school named for his most prized
associate, John F. Kennedy, by that iconic figure's brother (Ted),
son (John) and the surviving galaxy of American liberalism. Coming
off the Ontario farm, Galbraith decided early to work with his head
rather than his hands, that the brain, not the back, was the muscle
he favored, and that judicious courting of power was the way to go.
That he's been very good at it was amply demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   The turnout was top-shelf, and the video tribute (narrator:
Walter Cronkite) featured encomiums from Clinton &AMP; Gore. Harvard
runs lots of shindigs with intellectual candlepower on parade, but
this one featured warmth as well as light for a scholar who's
chowed at the Faculty Club for 65 years. Ted Kennedy ignited the
drumroll, recalling how Galbraith's father, a prairie liberal, once
addressed a farm gathering from atop a manure pile, declaring he
was ``standing on the Conservative Party platform.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean Joe Nye and Marin Kalb of the K School presided; Willian
vanden Heuvel bestowed a $25,000 prize upon the canny
Scots-Canadian economist. Nader Darehshori, Galbraith's publisher
at Houghton Mifflin, where the lanky professor enjoys a 46-year
run, was co-host, and highlighted the truly astonishing appeal of a
graceful writer who's produced 40-odd books on serious subjects
elaborated light-heartedly.
</P>
<P>
   In an advance copy of ``Between Friends,'' a collection of
essays on Galraith by 16 notables, the great man himself counsels:
``All authors should seek to establish a relationship of warmth,
affection and mutual mistrust with their publishers in the hope
that the uncertainty will add, however marginally, to
compensation.'' More hints to writers: Rewrite ruthlessly so ``the
product improves,'' and get to be a regular book reviewer. Why? It
``causes other reviewers, contemplating the reception of their own
books, to be marginally more judicious.''
</P>
<P>
   President Neil Rudenstine positioned Galbraith generously in the
Harvard constellation, alluding eliptically to Galbraith's lifelong
habit of volunteering advice on weighty subjects, in this case
Harvard's recent erosion in the endowment's bottom line. John F.
Kennedy Jr. showed again why he is the best public speaker of the
whole Kennedy food chain, for voice, manner, looks, self-possession
and modesty; his sang froid simply sizzles.
</P>
<P>
   Galbraith's three sons and his wife of 61 years, the widely
revered Kitty, were represented by a short and graceful toast from
son James, a boffin at University of Texas, who located his old
man's place in the pantheon of philosopher-economists alongside
such as John Stuart Mill, John Maynard Keynes and Marx (Karl, not
Groucho).
</P>
<P>
   William F. Buckley Jr., for decades the opposite bookend to
Galbraith's secure placement on the Lively Left, contributed his
patented barbs-dressed-as-irony. These two have long played
straight man to the other's ideological polarity, and their
affection is as durable as it is apparent. Arthur Schlesinger and
Gloria Steinem unveiled the new Galbraith Fund for fellowships
devoted to ``public service and humane ideals,'' jump-started with
over $600,000 in initial donations.
</P>
<P>
   The birthday cake was rolled forth in front of a kilted
bagpiper. No one was having a better time than the Birthday Boy,
who asked the piper: ``Do you know `The Campbells Are Coming?'''
Galbraith's remarks were brief, witty, and expansive. He is a man
who enjoys life, revels in a happy family situation, is more
cautious with his wealth than with his advice, and never loses
sight of the fact that life is a lot better for a lot more folks at
the end of this century than at the beginning, which is where he
came in.
</P>
<P>
   He looked forward gaily to his next big bash, at his 95th, and
there was no one present who did not wish to make that party as
well. Associates from a long public life toasted his health: George
McGovern, Kitty Dukakis, Katherine Graham, Tom Winship, John
Silber, Profs. Carl Kaysen and Nathan Glazer, and `formers' like
ex-Labor Secretary Robert Reich, and ex-Sen. Alan Simpson of
Wyoming. Roy Jenkins, the British politician now out of office long
enough to be called a statesman and be introduced as Lord Jenkins
of Hillhead, flew from Oxford with his wife to pronounce Galbraith
an international treasure.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts never got to vote for Galbraith. He wrote in
``Letters to Kennedy,'' his correspondence with JFK, that when
Kennedy offered him the ambassadorship to India, Galbraith asked
Kennedy: ``Would that be more useful than the Senate with the
prospect of bringing some decency back to Massachusetts Democratic
politics?'' He said yes, `by a factor of five to one.' Freshman
senators are not very useful; did I really want to spend my time
with Massachusetts politicians whom he described amiably as `that
gang of thieves.' I told him I would not raise the matter again.''
</P>
<P>
   That book is a goldmine for political sophisticates. In one
letter to Kennedy, Galbraith counseled there are three
qualifications for appointing office-holders: ``ability, political
acceptability and personal loyalty.'' He added: ``I have difficulty
in appreciating your use of Dean Acheson (Truman's Secretary of
State, then advising JFK). He is able. He has reestablished himself
politically with the right. But I cannot think he is capable of
loyalty. He will be a source of trouble for he wants the policy
that serves his ego, not your needs.''
</P>
<P>
   In that same letter from India in 1961, Galbraith warned Kennedy
that the situation in ``South Vietnam is exceedingly bad. I hope,
incidentally, that your information from there is good and I have
an uneasy feeling that what comes in regular channels is very bad.
Unless I am mistaken Diem has alienated his people to a far greater
extent than we allow ourselves to know. This is our old mistake. We
take the ruler's word and that of our own people who have become
committed to him... But I fear that we have one more government
which, on present form, no one will support.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be 14 years, and 55,000 American soldiers dead, and a
million Vietnamese lives wasted in war, before that letter's gloomy
forecast was apparent to Washington. Then, as now, Galbraith's was
a voice worth heeding.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT JUDGE REGARDED AS TOUGH BUT FAIR

financial categories for release Monday, Oct. 19.
 &HT;    A black and white file photo of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Last December, when Microsoft Corp. insisted that
the Windows 95 operating system wouldn't work without its Internet
browser, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson decided to
find out for himself.
</P>
<P>
   With help from a courtroom technician, the judge was able to
``uninstall'' his own Explorer Internet browser in about 90
seconds. With that, Jackson ordered the software giant to begin
selling Windows 95 separate from its browser.
</P>
<P>
   While that order was overturned on appeal _ leading eventually
to the new Justice Department suit against Microsoft based on the
Windows 98 software that goes to trial Monday _ Jackson's dive into
the technical aspects of the case is indicative of his approach to
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom calls it like he sees it,'' says James Schaller, his
former law partner at Jackson &AMP; Campbell in Washington. ``That's
his signature. Most people respect him for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, 61, will be presiding over what has been billed as the
antitrust lawsuit of the decade. The suit pits the Justice
Department and the attorneys general of 20 states against
Microsoft, the world's leading software company. At issue: Whether
Microsoft has used its dominance in the market for personal

BARRETT BUOYED BY ACCLAIM FOR `VOYAGE OF THE NARWHAL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andrea Barrett had toiled for three years on her first novel,
revising the manuscript six times while supporting herself doing
various menial jobs, everything from dental-surgery assistant to
greenhouse technician to tax-form typist.
</P>
<P>
   Then Barrett finally summoned enough courage to attend her first
writers conference, lugging her manuscript along with her hopes.
One of the teachers there was intrigued enough to read it and offer
his appraisal: Forget it. Move on to something else. Too much has
been done to this for it ever to amount to much of anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was right,'' confirmed Barrett, winner of the 1996 National
Book Award for fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett's own reaction was much different 14 years ago when
writing teacher Nicholas Delbanco offered his assessment of her
first novel. She spent an entire day in tears, then five more days
in a disheartened rereading of the manuscript until she finally
consigned it to the wastebasket. She later did the same with her
second novel, since it seemed to suffer from the same problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad they're (the novels) both gone; they were both so
terrible,'' Barrett added in an interview during a tour to promote
her excellent new novel, ``The Voyage of the Narwhal'' (W.W.
Norton, 399 pages, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   Becoming a writer of literary fiction these days, as Barrett's
example shows, often is a test of resolve and nerve perhaps as much
as of writing talent. And even with those attributes, it all can
come to naught. There is too much competition, too few readers, too
little criticism, too many skittish publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, every once in a while, a worthy literary writer such as
Barrett will emerge, often as a result of some major prize or some
other stroke of good fortune, and to no one's surprise more than
the writer's.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett had written four well-received, but slow-selling novels
before ``Ship Fever,'' a collection of stories and a novella for
which she had no great expectations beyond her past work. Indeed, a
collection seemed even more chancy than a novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a very real chance it would not be published,
especially since I had such a bad track record with sales of my
four novels,'' Barrett said. ``So when my publisher, Norton, did a
beautiful book and it got some nice reviews and went on to sell
6,500 copies, I was pleased. If it had all stopped right there, I
would have been a very happy woman.''
</P>
<P>
   But it did not stop there. ``Ship Fever'' was named finalist for
the National Book Award, the second-most prestigious prize in
American publishing after the Pulitzer, and Barrett soon found
herself in the audience for the gala ceremony at the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City, her first black-tie event.
</P>
<P>
   She had been persuaded to draft some comments in the event she
won, as all finalists are, but Barrett was so certain she would not
need them that she did not bring her reading glasses in her tiny
evening purse. Then her name was called as the winner and she was
so stunned she thought she might be sick to her stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Barrett is still stunned as she reaps more
rewards from the National Book Award.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Voyage of the Narwhal'' is receiving the sort of prominent
and serious reviews that only works by the most notable writers are
accorded and it is nearing best-seller status.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett has almost finished her first book tour, a cross-country
hopscotch through 17 cities, where she has been facing a series of
interviewers and a host of her readers, meeting more people in the
past two weeks than the intensely private writer used to meet in a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I literally can't believe it on some days,'' she admitted.
``In the middle of a reading, I'll sometimes realize what I'm doing
and I get so startled that my voice will freeze up. I have to force
myself not to be conscious that people are actually listening to me
because it seems such madness.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett's refreshing honesty is only one of her appealing traits
in the still-unexpected glare of attention. The 43-year-old writer
from Rochester, N.Y., comes across as bright, earnest, modest and
thoughtful. There is about her a certain elegance and reserve, too,
traits that, in these Jerry Springer days, seem oddly 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   That is not a coincidence. Barrett has been fascinated with the
19th century since girlhood when her love of reading led her into
the fiction of that time and the accounts of its arctic explorers,
those compelling true sagas of life and death and solitude in the
white world of ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ship Fever'' and now ``The Voyage of Narwhal'' reflect that
19th-century fascination, with their focus on the bygone era's
sense of wonder and restraint, plus a writing style to reflect that
time.
</P>
<P>
   As Barrett explained, ``I attempt to emulate 19th-century
restraint in writing and in talking of personal issues because I
value restraint. I like prose that is cleaner; I like fiction that
hints more subtly than shrieks when dealing with emotion. Not
everybody likes that, I recognize. Some people find me too quiet in
person; some find my books too quiet, too. But that's OK. I am
quiet and so are my books.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Voyage of Narwhal'' showcases Barrett's remarkable
talents, her poetic descriptions, her measured plotting, her
masterful grasp of science, her marvelous depictions of landscape,
both physical and mental.
</P>
<P>
   But this novel of an ill-fated arctic expedition in the 1850s is
not a mere photocopy of what might have been written back then.
Barrett infuses her novel with concerns of the 20th century, the
power of celebrity, the dangers of obsession, the drawbacks of
``progress,'' the mistreatment of indigenous peoples, the
distortions of ``truth,'' the aftermath of fame.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett's novel shows the distinct benefits of her own
background in science _ she majored in biology in college and once
expected to become a scientist (as are many of her friends and her
husband). It also shows the depth of her immersion in the accounts
of 19th-century ex plorers.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett admitted she read 350 books about those explorers for
her novel, more than necessary perhaps, but also indicative of the
breadth of her mind and the nature of her approach to her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a belief amounting to a superstition about the need to
throw myself into a swimming pool filled with the books of a period
in order that, by some strange osmosis, it will enter my writing
through my unconscious,'' she said. ``I believe that the only way
to write historical fiction that is alive is for me to sink so
deeply into a period that I know it as well as I know now. Besides,
I'm a slow learner and not an economical writer. I will sometimes
spend a year reading 100 books for a 20-page short story, as I did
for `Rare Bird' in `Ship Fever.'''
</P>
<P>
   This might lead some observers to infer that Barrett is a
glutton for literary punishment, subjecting herself to too many
weighty volumes. She strongly counters that notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not onerous work for me _ I love it,'' she stressed.
``I do this not because I'm some virtuous creature; I do this for
me. It's play for me and I can't believe that anybody lets me get
away with it.''

`THE JOY OF WORK' _ DILBERT SHARES SOME FUN-LOVING TIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scott Adams can afford to skewer corporate America. He doesn't
work there anymore.
</P>
<P>
   But the creator of the Dilbert comic strip hasn't forgotten the
millions who do, and who rely on his wicked renderings of life in
cubicle-ville to make their days more bearable.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he wrote ``The Joy of Work _ Dilbert's Guide to
Finding Happiness at the Expense of your Co-workers'' (Harper
Business, 1998, $22).
</P>
<P>
   Adams considers himself a workplace expert of sorts, even though
he quit his engineering job several years ago and now operates from
a home office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get hundreds of messages a day,'' said Adams, who solicits
e-mail on the strip. ``Plus, every time I go out the door, I get
stopped by people who want to tell me their own stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the well of business stupidity runs deep and Adams said
he's nowhere close to running out of inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   The workplace seems to breed bad ideas, he said. ``Whenever you
get three smart people together, they get stupid collectively.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be bad for people at work, but it's great fun for
Adams, who said there's no danger Dilbert will become a
telecommuter in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   His cast of characters includes his alter ego, the endlessly
deadpan Dilbert, as well as Catbert, the evil human resources
director; Dogbert, the maniacal adviser; Ratbert, the hapless temp
with low self-esteem; Wally, the woefully stupid co-worker; and the
always illustrious pointy-haired boss.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ongoing workplace traumas of his characters, Adams
said the real workers of America have reason to hope.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, workers were cringing under their desks for fear
of downsizing, he said. With unemployment at all-time lows, they
have more clout today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good time to get your revenge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And revenge is one of Adams' main areas of expertise, according
to his latest management tome.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few suggested activities for improving your own
morale at the expense of others.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fun with phones. ``If you have at least two co-workers you
don't like, that's all you need for phone fun,'' he writes. ``Sneak
into the cubicle of one of them and forward the phone to the other.
This is especially effective if they dislike each other as much as
you dislike them.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Dress codes. ``Create an update to the employee dress code.
For realism, make sure it has no basis in common sense,'' he said.
For example, as a helpful transition to ``casual Fridays,''
institute a ``stained Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In your memo, point out that this is the sort of management
change that creates winning companies,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Multishirking. All you need for this is a hands-free headset
for your telephone, he writes. ``Once you're properly equipped, you
can make personal phone calls while simultaneously using your
computer for personal entertainment. ... Multishirking is not only
fun, it doubles the odds that an observer will think you're doing
at least one work-related activity.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has other helpful tips.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on the joy of sarcasm, he writes: ``Sarcasm can get
you fired if your boss realizes you aren't being a team player. But
that risk is low. Your sarcasm will go safely undetected if you
simply use your boss's own words. This is obviously the easiest
form of sarcasm to master, since it requires no creativity. It
doesn't even have to make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Adams quotes from real e-mails readers have sent
him. One reader recounted how he borrowed a line from Wally's
weekly activity report for his own performance review.
</P>
<P>
   In his review he wrote, ``I streamlined my business processess
while honing my participatory style and my proactive attitude, all
while valuing diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Commenting to Adams, the reader noted, ``My pointy-haired boss
either didn't see the humor in it or didn't read it at all, and it
is now part of my permanent record as an employee.''
</P>
<P>
   This is an effective use of sarcasm, Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Adams has absorbed a few of his own corporate values
along the way. He admits he writes books for money.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I hope people get out of the book is a deep emotional
need to buy the sequel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And there will be plenty more of those.
</P>
<P>
   The only threat he sees to Dilbert's universe is if managers
across America suddenly get a clue and start acting rationally, he
said. ``But what we're betting on is whether people will get much
smarter in the next few years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And evolution doesn't work that quickly.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Trying to keep a peaceful place away from a murder
 &HT;    Ana Pecina Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can you hate someone you have never met?
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the news broke that the body of a victim of one of
Texas' most feared killers had been discovered on the peaceful
banks of the Brazos River in Falls County, my home.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Reed, 28, mother of a 13-year-old girl, had been
kidnapped from an Austin car wash and tortured before she was slain
and buried on the banks of the Falls on the Brazos some seven years
ago, police said.
</P>
<P>
   When I read the news, I called home. ``Where was it?'' I
demanded of my older sister.
</P>
<P>
   You see, if you grew up in Marlin, you knew the Brazos, from
Rock Dam Roadto below the Falls, a spot where Native Americans used
to cross Texas'
</P>
<P>
   longest river. And chances are, if you know that river, your
memories of it are good ones.
</P>
<P>
   My sister gave the answer I didn't want to hear. It was right
there, she said, right near where we used to go.
</P>
<P>
   On many a summer Sunday afternoon, my mom would put sandwiches
in a cooler
</P>
<P>
   and my three sisters and me in the car, and we'd go to my dad's
gas station.
</P>
<P>
   There, he and I would proceed to fill the cooler with sodas from
his
</P>
<P>
   machine. I liked to be in charge of the selection: so many Big
Reds, so many
</P>
<P>
   Sun Tang Oranges and so many Cokes. His soft drink machine only
had three
</P>
<P>
   selections.
</P>
<P>
   Off we would head down Highway 6 to the Falls. More often than
not, aunts,
</P>
<P>
   uncles, cousins or neighbors would join us.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge that now spans the Falls did not exist then. Instead,
we would cross on a concrete slab which lay in the river. How it
got there or who put it there, I don't know, but it served its
purpose. I don't think it was wide enough to accommodate two cars
passing each other, but it always had severalinches of water
flowing over it, depending on the season. It could be a scary ride
for a small child. After all, we were in the middle of a river in
our car, but such are the experiences that build the unshakable
trust of a little girl in her father. He always got us there
safely.
</P>
<P>
   The reason to cross was the beach on the west bank. The east
bank, closest to Marlin, was steep and covered with vegetation, a
great place to fish, but
</P>
<P>
   not to swim.
</P>
<P>
   Kids wanted to swim and did we ever, but always under watchful
grown-up eyes. Part of the swimming area, clear water flowing over
a rock bottom, could be slippery but provided a primitive preview
of today's water park slides.
</P>
<P>
   Those days were filled with laughter, camaraderie and just plain
fun: the stuff happy childhoods are made of. In fact, it was one of
the first places I showed my future husband when I finally took him
home.
</P>
<P>
   Then last week, I learned a monster had been there, and I hated
him.
</P>
<P>
   I told my sister during our phone call. She understood but she
said her overridingm memory of the spot was still ``baloney
sandwiches and Big Red.''
</P>
<P>
   She told me she often crosses the river in her daily travels and
that one recent day, after the discovery of the body, she saw a car
parked there and several people standing nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wondered if it was her family, and I started to stop. I
wanted to see if I could help,'' she said. ``But then I figured
they wanted their privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   So she drove on and the next time she passed, she saw flowers at
the spot.
</P>
<P>
   I knew she was trying to comfort me when she said, ``It was a
real pretty place.''
</P>
<P>
   Then I re-read a quote from the victim's sister, Lori Bible.
``It was some solace for me to know that Colleen has rested in a
pretty place for seven years.''
</P>
<P>
   By no means do I dare compare my anger at the intrusion on my
wonderful memories to the terrible loss experienced by Ms. Reed's
family.
</P>
<P>
   But after hearing from those two sisters, I decided to replace
hate with hope, hope that the horror that happened on those banks
could somehow be softened by the happiness that thrived there years
earlier. Happiness which still lightens my heart.
</P>
<P>
   A foolish wish, perhaps. But it's also a symbol of my refusal to
allow the mindless act of serial killer Kenneth Allen McDuff, a man
I have never met, to obliterate the joys of a happy life.
</P>
<P>
   My hope is the same for Ms. Reed's family.

ELIZABETH ALLEN OF JAPAN FUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., Oct. 18)  
(JT) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until the Federal Reserve Board cut interest rates again and
Congress agreed to more than $90 billion in financing for the
International Monetary Fund, the biggest development last week in
the effort to stave off global recession seemed to be made in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   After numerous false starts, Tokyo announced a $500 billion plan
to rescue ailing Japanese banks. Western officials, who have been
pressing the Japanese to shore up their banking system, hoped it
would help pull the Japanese economy out of recession.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the hopes. But as the details filter out, the plan
appears to offer less rather than more.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Allan, a portfolio manager at the Japan Fund for the
last 11 years and a student of the country for more than a
quarter-century, put it in perspective during a telephone
conversation from Tokyo early Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What role do you think Asia, and Japan in particular, played
in the decision by the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, to cut rates?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think the reason he did it is because the Japanese stock
market has reacted so weakly to the bank package. As of Thursday,
the market was actually below where it was when the package was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The bank program was billed as one that would reform Japanese
banks, allowing the healthy to survive and the weak to fail. It
doesn't do that, does it?
</P>
<P>
   A. This is a bailout, not reform. I think the system needs to be
reformed, but the politicians have a different view. They much
prefer a muddle-through approach rather than a dramatic one, and
seem to have retreated from an approach which calls for a stringent
inquiry into the health of the system.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Still, we're talking about half a trillion dollars. Won't
that help?
</P>
<P>
   A. On a short-term basis, it does look as though the stimulus
that is part of this announcement will have some positive impact on
the economy, even though it will help most of the country's
traditionally strong interest groups the most, like agriculture and
real estate interests.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Consumers are seen as another troubled element in the
economy. Have you seen evidence that demand is picking up?
</P>
<P>
   A. I have been here about a week on this trip, and one of the
things I have been looking at is the retail sector.
</P>
<P>
   As I wandered around shops last weekend, there were mobs and
mobs of people out, but not many were walking out of the stores
with shopping bags. That tells me people are interested, but in
terms of actual purchases it looks somewhat subdued.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What was the talk?
</P>
<P>
   A. One of my favorite sources to find out what folks are
thinking is taxi drivers. I had one on Thursday who was utterly
scornful of the bank package, saying that everyone involved in the
package lied to the people. He also said that until there is
confidence in the system, there will be no change, and that
consumers are not so easily fooled. That is exactly the point.
Until there is some way of knowing which banks are solvent, the
whole economic infrastructure is suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You are not exactly describing an economy on the mend. How do
you invest the Japan Fund's money under such conditions?
</P>
<P>
   A. We have tried to maintain a balance between unexciting but
attractively valued domestic names, and there are some, even in a
weak economic environment.
</P>
<P>
   I have also been looking at Japanese pharmaceutical companies,
which until recently had a fairly low profile on the international
scene. Some of the larger-cap names are Takeda, Yamanouchi and
Chugai.
</P>
<P>
   Q. A year ago, some people were saying Japanese stocks were
cheap. They are even cheaper now. What sort of advice do you give
to someone considering investing?
</P>
<P>
   A. It is important to be very selective investing in Japan at
this point and has been for some time. But for those with a time
horizon of five years or more, it is important to realize that at
some point Japan, an important country with many strengths, will
come out of this.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What sort of indicators suggesting a turn is coming are you
looking for?
</P>
<P>
   A. The most important ones are a reduction in capacity in many
areas, starting with the banking system. If they try to keep every
bank alive then even the best ones will be hard pressed to make a
profit. But it is not limited to banking. It is also true in a
number of other sectors, from agriculture and retailing to
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Will the rest of Asia remain sick until Japan gets well?
</P>
<P>
   A. Most people would say the rest of Asia can't rebound without
Japan. A stronger Japan would be a positive. But Asia is going to
need to think about planning for its short- and mid-term future
without the help of a stronger Japan.

SICK, SICK, SICK: JEREMY STROHMEYER? WORDS FAIL ME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm trying to think of a word that is strong enough, derogatory
enough, to describe Jeremy Strohmeyer. I can't come up with one.
</P>
<P>
   Strohmeyer is the despicable creep who sexually assaulted and
murdered 7-year-old Sherrice Iverson in May 1997 in a women's room
at a Las Vegas casino. He pleaded guilty last month and was
sentenced Wednesday to life in prison without possibility of
parole.
</P>
<P>
   The evil nature of many criminals can be conveyed through words
such as ``despicable, vile, horrendous.'' The brutality and
senselessness of Strohmeyer's crime defies easy description _ as
did his performance during the sentencing hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Strohmeyer actually had the audacity to stand up in court and
beg to be forgiven _ even as he offered up every excuse under the
sun in a mind-boggling attempt to evade responsibility for the
atrocity he committed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am truly sorry,'' he said. ``If I were given the opportunity
to exchange my life for Sherrice's and bring her back, I would not
hesitate, not even for a second.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right. If Strohmeyer felt so guilt-ridden, so remorseful,
why didn't he volunteer to accept his rightful punishment, the
death penalty, rather than copping a plea that allows him to live
out his potentially long life _ he's 20 years old _ at taxpayer
expense?
</P>
<P>
   And if he truly felt such grief for Sherrice and such penitence
for his crime, why did he devote so much of his 22-page,
pre-sentencing statement to a shockingly self-indulgent laundry
list of excuses for what he did?
</P>
<P>
   Strohmeyer blamed a ``convergence of malignant forces'' for
driving him to murder, listing himself as merely one of many
factors that could be blamed for the vicious, violent death of
Sherrice Iverson.
</P>
<P>
   And just exactly what were some of these ``malignant forces''
that overrode Strohmeyer's free will and used him as an instrument
of murder?
</P>
<P>
   Well, Strohmeyer said, it was the fault of county officials for
not telling his adoptive parents that his birth mother was a
schizophrenic and drug abuser. It was his former girlfriend's fault
for turning him into a drug-crazed speed freak. It was a
therapist's fault for not treating his psychological problems. He
even blamed the casino for allowing Sherrice to cross his path and
thus become a target for his violent urges.
</P>
<P>
   And oh, yes, let's not forget about Strohmeyer's friend, David
Cash, who witnessed at least part of the attack on Sherrice and
went on his merry way without intervening or notifying police.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes me sick,'' Strohmeyer said of Cash.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's something we can agree on. How unfortunate that
prosecutors were unable to identify a law that would allow them to
put Cash in prison with his pal.
</P>
<P>
   All this excuse-making was no doubt inspired by Strohmeyer's
lawyer, Leslie Abramson. You remember Abramson _ she's the
fast-talking defense attorney who claimed that child abuse caused
the Menendez brothers to murder their parents.
</P>
<P>
   After working out the plea arrangement that spared Strohmeyer a
trial and the likely imposition of the death penalty, Abramson held
a news conference at which she claimed that Strohmeyer was a good
kid who was driven to murder by outside forces. She painted her
client as a victim of circumstance, drugs, evil associates _ about
the only alibi she didn't mention was, ``The devil made him do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And there stood Strohmeyer in the courtroom the other day,
regurgitating his lawyer's preposterous defense strategy as if it
had something to do with reality.
</P>
<P>
   Sherrice Iverson's parents didn't buy it for a minute. When they
were given the opportunity to address Strohmeyer, they made the
most of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to look at your evil face,'' said the victim's mother,
Yolanda Manuel.
</P>
<P>
   Sherrice's father, Leroy Iverson, said that he had hoped to see
Strohmeyer put to death. Deprived of that satisfaction, Iverson
said, he would take solace in the expectation that Strohmeyer will
suffer a lifetime of misery and indignity in prison.
</P>
<P>
   I'll second that.

`THE GIRL NEXT DOOR' AN EYE-OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Annie, the insecure, emotionally thin heroine at the center
of ``The Girl Next Door,'' is rescued from a woman-beating creep by
a charming police officer, she has no idea she's about to enter an
even darker world. Officer Craig Mitchell isn't what he seems, a
revelation disclosed early on in this surprisingly watchable drama.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell slides into Annie's life effortlessly and efficiently,
gaining her trust and her tortured heart, even though he's married,
with no intention of severing ties with his two energetic children.
</P>
<P>
   Annie is convinced he'll leave his wife for her, and midway
through this two-hour movie, he decides to do just that. But he
needs help. He needs Annie to don a black mask, point a revolver at
his wife's chest, and fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a police officer,'' Craig assures his new love. ``I know
how these things work.''
</P>
<P>
   He does. The murder is pulled off perfectly: Annie emerges from
the shadows of what looks like a warehouse, saying nothing before
pulling the trigger four times, hitting the wife twice in the
chest, once each in the stomach and arm. She leaves no evidence, so
it goes in the books as a botched robbery attempt. All's well. Or
is it?
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Girl Next Door,'' (8 p.m. CDT Tuesday, CBS), writer Mel
Frohman and director David Greene have caught the enraptured
impotence of psychological gloom and turned it up a notch. The
high-minded will cringe at this, but ``Girl Next Door'' is actually
what last week's snobbish ``Crime and Punishment'' wanted to be.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ``Crime,'' which misfired in its attempts to put us
``inside'' the mind of its murderous lead, ``Girl Next Door'' hangs
back, and, surprisingly for a made-for-network movie, actually
provides insight into guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Annie, played by Tracey Gold (another surprise,
huh?) is a complete wreck. She has moved into the home of the woman
she killed. Sleeping in her bed, rifling through her closets,
seeing the dead woman's framed photos, looking into the eyes of the
woman's offspring. ``My mom was killed,'' the little boy says to
Annie at one point. ``Did you know that?''
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder that ``Girl Next Door'' actually begins with
Annie dashing into a police station to turn herself in? She
eventually talks with Gayle, a police psychologist (Sharon Gless of
``Cagney &AMP; Lacey'' fame, who sleepwalks through this
just-a-paycheck-role), and the story unfolds in flashback.
</P>
<P>
   By confessing, Annie begins to come to grips with her own
identity, and ``Girl Next Door'' fleshes out yet another element,
that of a lonely woman who was a basket case to begin with. ``I
don't like the part of me, the part that's way down,'' Annie
confides to Gayle. ``The part that says I'm not pretty enough or
clever enough, and afraid of being alone in this world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gold, whose acting career (''Growing Pains'') floundered because
of anorexia prompted by her insecurities, acts with a defiant force
and desperation, playing Annie as a highly vulnerable woman who
defined herself by her men. She couldn't feel complete unless she
was in a relationship, even a bad one.
</P>
<P>
   As she asks a friend before falling into bed with Craig, ``Why
don't guys like me?''
</P>
<P>
   In one eerie scene, in fact, Annie's resolve is broken and she
tells Craig (Tom Irwin) that, OK, she'll kill his wife. Sobbing,
she keeps asking him to say, ``I love you.'' He does, giving her
all the reassurance she needs to kill.
</P>
<P>
   This week in TV:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``A Will of Their Own'' (7 p.m. CDT Sunday and 8 p.m. Monday,
NBC): What a waste. Over five hours, this miniseries looking at the
changing roles of women in America _ as seen through the eyes of
six generations of an American family_ is an empty, sappy,
melodramatic mess.
</P>
<P>
   The star is Lea Thompson, who ages from teen to wise old lady,
looking out of place as both. Daughters are born in the family
(sons simply disappear), cut up as teens, then turn their lives
around after witnessing some momentous event.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, they say things like, ``It's terrible to feel
like you have to give up one part of your soul to keep the rest!''
and ``Life is what you make of it. It's not what it makes of you!''
Oh, boy.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Emma's Wish'' (8 p.m. CDT Sunday, CBS): Joanna Kerns is a
75-year-old who gets her birthday wish to be 35 and clean up her
daughter's life, along with their relationship. A shallow, though
relatively harmless fantasy tale that also features Della Reese
delivering her usual motherly shtick.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Stranger in Town'' (8 p.m. CDT, Showtime): A talented Trevor
Blumas, along with his 13-year-old buddies, tries to solve a murder
mystery involving a mysterious drifter played by Harry Hamlin in
full cable mode _ the grungy, sexy type. For a suspenseful mystery,
it's a bit thin on suspense and, well, mystery.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The New Addams Family'' (6:30 p.m. CDT Monday, Fox Family
Channel): This new version of the '60s series that won't die is a
lot like a copy of a copy of a copy. It's quite faded. And it's on
every weeknight, no less.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``NYPD Blue'' (9 p.m. CDT Tuesday, ABC): Arriving fashionably
late, as usual, is the emotional cop series that needs (and will
get) a shot in the arm. The story arc opening the door for Jimmy
Smits' departure begins; replacement Rick Schroder is on deck.
Executive producer Steven Bochco insists that Schroder ``blew us
away,'' and was ``by far the best candidate'' to be partnered with
Dennis Franz's Andy Sipowicz. We'll see.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Discovery News'' (9 p.m. CDT Saturday, Discovery): This news
program devotes an hour to U.S. Sen. John Glenn, scheduled to
return to orbit next week at age 77. Might not be a bad time to
revisit ``The Right Stuff'' (11 a.m. Saturday, TNT), the film about
the seven original astronauts aboard that 1962 mission; here, Glenn
is played by Ed Harris.

   &UR; Budget With a Surplus: Late, but No Shutdown &LR;
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Congress reached agreement, only 16 days
late and without a government shutdown, on a $1.7 trillion budget
for fiscal 1999 that is the first since the late 1960s not to
include deficit spending. The deal included an industry-backed
increase in visa quotas for foreign workers with technology skills,
a sharp increase in military spending, aid for farmers and new
money for the International Monetary Fund, but no general tax cuts.
Projects to combat global warming and farm runoff won financing; so
did plans to step up logging on public lands in the West and
Alaska. A bankruptcy overhaul passed by Congress but disliked by
the White House was omitted from the deal.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Once Again, Drug Giants Can't Get Along &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Any doctor or pharmacist knows the importance of checking for
harmful cross-reactions before putting together two drugs, but the
idea appears to be lost on drug-company bosses. For the third time
this year, an announced merger of pharmaceutical giants fell apart,
largely because the chief executives of the two companies could not
agree on sharing power. Last week it was American Home Products and
Monsanto calling the whole thing off, following bust-ups between
SmithKline Beecham and Glaxo Wellcome in February and Smithkline
and American Home in January.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Headache, Thy Name Is `Hedge Fund' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica said it would eat $372 million of a $1.3 billion
unsecured loan to D.E. Shaw &AMP; Co., a hedge-fund manager, and would
take over and liquidate Shaw's entire $20 billion bond portfolio in
hopes of recouping the rest. The bank's bum hedge-fund loan, rotten
trading results, write-downs on a mortgage-servicing portfolio and
merger-related charges hammered third-quarter earnings down 80
percent from a year earlier ... Another hedge fund, Ellington
Capital Management, dumped a huge position in mortgage-backed
securities to cover margin calls from its lenders and stave off
insolvency ... Merrill Lynch demoted the executive in charge of
managing the firm's financial risk-taking, two days after reporting
a steep quarterly loss related to market turmoil and saying it
would lay off 5 percent of its staff.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Earnings Smiles and Scowls &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Companies reporting happy surprises in a heavy week for
quarterly earnings reports included Apple Computer, back from the
dead thanks to its red-hot iMac computer, as well as Chrysler,
Delta Air Lines, Intel and Johnson &AMP; Johnson. Disappointers
included General Motors, whose results were savaged by an
eight-week strike, along with Caterpillar, Eastman Kodak, Pfizer
and several brokerage firms, including Bear Stearns, Paine Webber
and Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Notes &LR;  ...
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor jumped back into the auction to buy Korea's
debt-hobbled Kia Motors and its sister, Asia Motors ... Two top
executives of Triarc bid to take the beverage company private ...
The two largest compilers of Internet ``audience'' statistics,
Media Matrix and Relevant Knowledge, agreed to merge. ... A
battered Cendant abandoned its planned to buy American Bankers
Insurance. ... Primestar scrapped a plan to buy the
direct-broadcast satellite venture of the News Corp. and MCI
Worldcom ... A $517 billion package of bank rescue measures was
approved by Japan's legislature ... Retail sales rose only modestly
in September, despite strong demand and higher prices for cars.
Over all, consumer prices were unchanged. Producer prices rose more
than expected, but analysts called it a blip; industrial production
weakened ... Columbia/HCA, under investigation for Medicare billing
fraud, sued one of its former top executives, accusing him of
conspiring with vendors to defraud the hospital chain.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SO TO SPEAK &LR;  ...
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Beating the Rush &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In the mail comes an alarming-looking card featuring a tight
close-up of a clock reading two minutes to midnight. Black stripes
slash across the garish yellow clock face, asking in computerish
type, ``Concerned about the millennium bug?'' and listing a Web
site to contact. A fire-red stripe says ``Every minute counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the addressee has been worrying about the Year 2000
problem, in which computers that think of years in two digits may
be faked out to deleterious effect when '99 becomes '00. Perhaps
the mailing offers a consultant's smart prevention strategies or a
software house's handy diagnostic tools.
</P>
<P>
   Curiosity whetted, the recipient flips open the card to discover
that it is from . . . a law firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the turn of the century is not yet upon us,'' the
card allows, the New York firm of Bernstein Litowitz Berger &AMP;
Grossman has a Year 2000 Practice Group ``ready to assist our
clients in their efforts to vindicate their legal rights with
respect to defective products infected by the Millennium Bug.'' The
firm already has several big class-action lawsuits contending Year
2000 software flaws, including suits against Intuit and the Medical
Manager Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   The card's implicit message: Never mind that any harm the
dawning of 2000 may do remains 63 weeks in the future. It's never
too soon to sue.

DAVIS, LUNGREN DEBATE HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY and ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As his campaign for governor struggles to
attract moderate Democrats and independent voters, Republican Dan
Lungren has wrapped himself in the legacy of Ronald Reagan while
remaining unapologetic about a conservative record his opponent
says is more Gingrich than the Gipper.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren's extensive record after a decade in Congress during the
Reagan years, and eight more as California attorney general, became
the centerpiece of the fourth and final debate Thursday with Lt.
Gov. Gray Davis, the Democratic candidate for governor.
</P>
<P>
   The forum at San Francisco State University was punctuated by
dozens of death-penalty protesters outside and the arrest inside of
Peace and Freedom candidate Gloria La Riva, who rushed the stage to
participate in the ``rich men's debating club.'' La Riva was
charged with disturbing the peace and resisting arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The debate also had Lungren take a slap at San Francisco's
decade-old program to provide condoms to prisoners in the county
jail _ an AIDS-prevention measure Sheriff Michael Hennessey
defended as ``a critical way'' to prevent the spread of the deadly
disease.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly the debate was about Lungren and Davis bringing up
positions, statements and votes from 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of people have moved to California since the
Mediterranean fruit fly caused a panic in the early 1980s, but
Lungren made sure to mention that Davis was then-Gov. Jerry Brown's
chief of staff at the time. And Davis was ready with dozens of
votes Lungren cast in Congress between 1979 and 1989, when Lungren
sometimes found himself aligned with the most extreme
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Slightly behind in the polls with less than three weeks before
the election, Lungren said he was proud of his votes in Congress
and questioned whether Davis even had a record. The politically
cautious Davis, Lungren and his staff say, was ``boldly neutral''
on a securities reform initiative fiercely opposed in the Silicon
Valley and didn't even take a position on the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was proud when I was in Congress to be the single, strongest
supporter of Ronald Reagan,'' Lungren said. ``We took the road less
traveled for less government, less spending, lower taxes and
restoring pride in America.''
</P>
<P>
   But Davis had a powerful weapon against Lungren's attempt to
show himself as a Reagan Republican: The congressional record.
Lungren, Davis pointed out during the debate, was one of only 21
members of the House of Representatives to vote in 1986 against the
Safe Drinking Water Act, a measure eventually signed by Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan Lungren isn't a bad person, but he is a bad choice to lead
California,'' Davis said. ``He's simply out of step on too many
important issues. He would take us backwards on a woman's right to
choose, backwards on education, backwards on the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   When Lungren tried to defend his vote against the Safe Drinking
Water Act as an attempt to balance the national budget, Davis shot
back, ``Which is it? Is Reagan leading the revolution or are you
leading your own little rogue effort over here?''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's hourlong debate is certain to be the last between
Lungren and Davis, who have faced each other four times this year.
The forum was not broadcast in the state's largest media market,
Los Angeles, and the two candidates have reneged on their agreement
to debate there before the election.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lungren's strategy to invoke Reagan led him to talk about the
economy. Both of his questions to Davis concerned taxes and
``job-killer'' measures he says Davis either supported or didn't
actively oppose. Once again, Lungren questioned why Davis did not
fight against Proposition 211, a 1996 initiative that would have
allowed class-action lawsuits over stock fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative was opposed by Silicon Valley, but supported by a
major Davis campaign contributor _ class-action lawyer Bill Lerach.
President Clinton and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., opposed the
initiative, but Davis never took a position.
</P>
<P>
   Davis gave his weakest explanation of the night when he said he
didn't think he was under any obligation to take a position on
every initiative on the ballot, and that he wasn't an expert on the
securities reform issue.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren sarcastically praised Davis for his modesty: ``I am
overwhelmed by your humility on this one, Gray, to say you have no
expertise on 211. You have better relations with the liberal trial
attorneys than anyone in California.''
</P>
<P>
   Lungren and Davis also clashed over the distribution of condoms
in schools, leading Lungren to an unexpected slap at San
Francisco's program to distribute condoms in the county lockup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I disagree with the sheriff of San Francisco,'' Lungren said,
``who happens to allow condoms to be distributed in the jail here
and then tells them (prisoners) not to use it and if they use it,
they can be prosecuted for a felony but they can always bring back
a used one and get a second or third one. ... We go crazy with
distribution of some of these things.''

DEMOCRAT LOSES GROUND IN ILLINOIS SENATE RACE

<P>
   October 8, 1998, Thursday Late Edition - FinalSection: A Page:
18 Column: 1 Desk: National Desk Length: 1266 words  &QL; 
 &QL; 
CHICAGO, Oct. 7 &QL; 
 &QL; 
She says he is ''duplicitous,'' a ''wolf in sheep's clothing'' who
has resorted to ''scuzzball'' campaign tactics in the past. He has
described her as ''shrill,'' contending that she has ''nothing
positive to say about her own record'' and saying her career has
been ''obscured by numerous scandals and controversies.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States Senate race between the incumbent Democrat,
Carol Moseley-Braun, and State Senator Peter Fitzgerald, a
conservative Republican, has become one of the most tensely watched
campaigns in the country. And with less than a month to go, the
candidates have dropped all pretense of keeping the gloves on.
</P>
<P>
   The latest poll, published last week in The Chicago Tribune,
suggests that Ms. Moseley-Braun, elected in 1992 as a rising star,
is in serious trouble. She lagged behind Mr. Fitzgerald by 10
percentage points, with more voters saying they believed Mr.
Fitzgerald was the more honest and trustworthy candidate. The poll,
which had a margin of error of three percentage points, also
suggested that she had lost considerable support among suburban
women, one of the main groups that swept her into office six years
ago in what became known as the '' Year of the Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Dogged by missteps and poor judgments in her personal and
political life, Ms. Moseley-Braun, 51, who was catapulted from an
obscure Cook County office to become the nation's first black
female senator, has had trouble getting voters to focus on her
legislative accomplishments. And she has been soundly outspent by
Mr. Fitzgerald, a 37-year-old multimillionaire from the Chicago
suburbs who inherited his family banking fortune and spent $7
million of his own money on the Republican primary alone.
</P>
<P>
   ''Have I not handled my own publicity and image making as well
as I could have?'' Ms. Moseley-Braun (pronounced brawn) said in an
interview. ''There's no question about that. Have I not handled the
politics as well as I could have? No question. But I certainly have
worked as hard as I can. I've got a great legislative record. And
with all the things that have been thrown at me, none of them has
stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Fitzgerald, considered so conservative that most Republican
leaders supported his moderate opponent in the bitterly contested
primary, has wasted no opportunity to try to make Ms.
Moseley-Braun's problems stick and to deflect her characterization
of him as an extremist by painting her as an ineffectual liberal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although her career has been somewhat obscured by numerous
scandals and controversies, those who have noticed her voting
record have noticed it is very extreme,'' Mr. Fitzgerald said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Across the board, these are tough times for Illinois Democrats.
In the race to replace Gov. Jim Edgar, a Republican who is
retiring, Glenn Poshard, a Democratic Congressman from downstate,
trailed George Ryan, the Republican Secretary of State, by 22
percentage points in The Tribune's poll.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Poshard has alienated liberal Democrats with his opposition
to abortion rights and some gay rights issues, as well as his past
votes against gun control and environmental measures. And he has
tried without much success to tar Mr. Ryan with a scandal in which
employees of the Secretary of State's office are accused of taking
bribes in return for granting truck licenses, and using some of the
bribe money to support Mr. Ryan and other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats running for other offices, even those in heavily
Democratic Cook County, are running into trouble, too. This year,
the state Legislature eliminated straight-party voting in Illinois,
long considered a boon to Democrats. And although Democrats are
hoping that the efforts of Congressional Republicans to impeach
President Clinton may spur Democrats to the polls in a kind of
backlash, so far the President's problems have not helped matters
and could lower turnout among Democratic voters. (Mr. Poshard even
stayed away from a Chicago fund-raiser on his behalf which Mr.
Clinton attended).
</P>
<P>
   All of that is making things harder for Senator Moseley-Braun.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always thought she was going to be in a tough race, even
against Fitzgerald, but I didn't think it was going to be this
tough,'' said Dawn Clark Netsch, a Democrat who ran for governor in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Senator had to press hard to get Mr. Fitzgerald to agree to
a debate, which was held on Sunday. Afterward, she said she had not
expected him to try to ''paint himself as a centrist'' and said,
''I could have made him show his true colors better.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Fitzgerald, for his part, said that the Senator sounded
''shrill'' in the debate and that she ''wasn't even able to
understand what I was talking about when I was talking about Social
Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had hoped Mr. Fitzgerald would win the primary because
they believed his conservative views would make him easier to
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Fitzgerald believes his wealth has allowed him to be more
independent in his political views. He opposes abortion, even in
cases of rape or incest, sponsored a bill signed into law by Mr.
Edgar that bans same-sex marriages, and would screen homosexuals
out of the military. He would use the Federal budget surplus to
provide tax cuts, while Ms. Moseley-Braun would use it to shore up
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moseley-Braun, who sits on the Senate Finance Committee, has
concentrated on cleaning up polluted industrial sites in cities,
fixing decrepit school buildings, improving pension laws for women,
and fighting for tax breaks on airline tickets and ethanol, issues
important in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   But she has also had to fend off accusations that she misused an
inheritance instead of reimbursing Medicaid for her mother's care,
ignored accusations of sexual harassment against her 1992 campaign
manager and former fiance, Kgosie Matthews, and that she and Mr.
Matthews had spent thousands of campaign dollars on personal
travel, jewelry and stereo equipment.
</P>
<P>
   She was also sharply criticized by human rights groups and the
State Department for a secret 1996 trip to Nigeria in which she and
Mr. Matthews met with Sani Abacha, the dictator who died this year.
</P>
<P>
   Although no investigation found any criminal wrongdoing and Ms.
Moseley-Braun has acknowledged making mistakes in judgment, she has
not been able to shake what she calls her ''negatives.'' A few
weeks ago, when George Will raised these issues in his column, the
Senator lost her temper, used a racial slur to portray herself as a
victim of racism and compared Mr. Will to a member of the Ku Klux
Klan, forcing her to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   ''She knows that she's in a dogfight. Most incumbents don't want
to debate,'' said Paul Green, a professor of political science at
Governors State University in Chicago. ''She wants the differences
between her and Fitzgerald to be the cornerstone of the election.''
</P>
<P>
   In the remaining weeks of the campaign, Ms. Moseley-Braun, a
charismatic campaigner, said she would work hard to reach
disaffected supporters. Her campaign has raised about $6 million
(compared with the $10 million Mr. Fitzgerald has already spent)
and has scheduled fund-raisers with Mayor Richard M. Daley of
Chicago, Mr. Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've worked myself already into bad health,'' said Ms.
Moseley-Braun, who was treated last week for pneumonia at a Texas
hospital after she became ill on a flight to Dallas. ''I'm doing
everything I know how.''

   CHINA-CNN _ BEIJING Chinese authorities have once again set up

declined to answer a written query on why average netsurfers in
Beijing could no longer dial up CNN website. ``It's not an easy
question to handle,'' said an official in the State Council's
information office. During the glow of openness before and during
President Bill Clinton's visit to China three months ago, both the
CNN and BBC websites were freely accessable to Chinese computer
users, as China appeared to be paring down its list of ``banned''
sites. But then this week, the BBC said the main state controlled
internet service provider ChinaNet was ``believed to be blocking
access'' to its main London-based site called bbc.co.uk. As a
result, the BBC said, web surfers in China were unable to access
the BBC's new web-based Mandarin language broadcast and transcript
service. CNN has made no similar announcement. (Kunstel/Albright,

unveil an austerity package to stave off a crisis by Oct. 20. With
a pool of 164 million consumers, companies like Coca-Cola and IBM
have a major stake in Brazil's future. In addition, Brazil is
Florida's biggest trading partner. Despite reassurances from the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank that relief will be
provided, economists -- and more importantly, banks and investors
-- have become increasingly pessimistic. (Emling, Cox News

<P>
   CONGRESS-RECORD _ WASHINGTON _ This 105th Congress has been
compared to the ``Do-Nothing'' 85th Congress excoriated by
President Harry Truman in 1948. But as it leaves town, the 105th
Congress left behind a record of major decisions that most
Americans liked. The five-year budget-balancing agreement and the
gigantic tax-cut package adopted by this Congress in 1997 seem to
be working. This year, Congress overwhelmingly adopted legislation
overhauling the IRS, providing multi-year funding for highways and
mass transit, and making major repairs in two troubled programs --
low-income housing and job-training. Perhaps its least-noticed
accomplishment will be restraint: It passed fewer laws than any
Congress in recent history and avoided divisive party-line splits
during this year's preparations for next year's efforts to repair
Social Security. (Mollison, Cox News Service 700).
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-MAJORITY _ WASHINGTON _ If Republicans increase their
Senate majority to 60 seats in the 106th Congress, President
Clinton could find himself under more pressure to use his veto
power even as he defends himself in an impeachment trial. Without
the 41 votes needed to sustain a Senate filibuster, the Democrats'
ability to block legislation or force compromises would be
weakened. History shows that such situations can lead to a high
number of presidential vetoes. (Mollison, Cox News Service).

   MILITIA-FORT-HOOD-PLOT _ We focus on Bradley Playford Glover and
Michael Leonard Dorsett, the two men who were arrested last year on
their way to attack Fort Hood and who pleaded guilty in September.
This was one of dozens of domestic terrorist plots thwarted by
police since the Oklahoma City bombing. (Tanamachi, Austin
American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   GANG-CIRCLE _ The Travis County DA's office has suggested using
a type of mediation based on Native American peace circles to work
out its controversial gang injunction. Last week, Ronnie Earle's
office called lawyers for the five defendants and told them if they
participate in a circle with community members _ in which each
person stands up and says whatever is on their mind and the
community can ask the defendants to do things to make amends _
prosecutors will drop the injunction. (Harmon, Austin
American-Statesman)

A BIG STING FLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Monday Oct. 19)  
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Recently, I learned about the insect-human connection,
specifically how people can mentally encourage giant Madagascar
hissing cockroaches to clamber all over their bodies by thinking
welcoming thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   I speculate that some people may not want giant Madagascar
hissing cockroaches, or any other kind of cockroach for that
matter, waltzing all over their bodies, which could explain why
welcoming cockroach-related thoughts are so rare and easily shoved
aside by thoughts of heavy construction boots, flame-throwers and
cans of Raid the size of grain silos.
</P>
<P>
   This, it turns out, is just another example of how ``arthropod
insensitive'' I have become and reminds me, once again, that I
should not scoff at new ideas simply because they come from someone
who may have had his or her umbilical cord wrapped a little too
tightly around his or her neck prior to birth.
</P>
<P>
   But my thinking on the whole subject of insect/human
lovey-doviness has changed dramatically in the past few days, and
without inhaling so much as a whiff of Black Flag. I am speaking
specifically of the Fire Ant Festival held recently in Marshall,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, located about 150 miles east of Dallas, has been
staging the Fire Ant Festival for 16 years and organizers this year
expected close to 40,000 people to attend.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of the festival is, without a doubt, the Fire Ant
Calling Contest, in which contestants squeak, howl or screech their
best approximation of a fire-ant feeding call, alarm call and _ my
personal favorite _ mating call.
</P>
<P>
   The winner gets $150, said special events coordinator Phyllis
Prince, enough to buy dinner and a movie, assuming your fire-ant
date doesn't have particularly expensive tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Although I have not read anything that indicates fire ants have
a feeding, alarm or mating call _ or at least any we can hear _ I
think the good folks of Marshall are to be congratulated for
attempting to communicate with fire ants in a way that does not
involve boiling water or Amdro.
</P>
<P>
   (Amdro, by the way, is the official sponsor of the Fire Ant
Festival, a fact that may shock some, but is probably no more odd
than Exxon sponsoring a PBS special on sea birds.)
</P>
<P>
   But there is more to the Fire Ant Festival than verbally
arousing nests of stinging insects into paroxysms of love. (Bill
Clinton, sadly, has refused an invitation to be the festival's
grand marshal.) There is also the fire ant roundup, in which
contestants gather up as many fire ants as they can in a milk jug.
The contents of the jug are weighed and the winner receives a cash
prize and, one hopes, a free ride to the emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there is the obligatory chili cook-off (this is
Texas, after all), all recipes for which are expected to contain
one or more fire ants. (No attempt has been made to reproduce the
sound a fire ant makes when it hits the hot chili, but I'm guessing
that some of the earlier works of Joe Cocker wouldn't be far off.)
</P>
<P>
   Prince was understandably stingy on the details, but she did
hint that the Marshall, Texas, Fire Ant Festival may soon be
something more than an annual gathering of beer-fueled loonies
cooing at ant hills or racing around in the hot sun with a milk jug
in one hand and a bowl of toxic chili in the other to see who can
be the first to succumb to anaphylactic shock. That's right,
diazanon breath, we're talking TV deal. Or at least a pilot. Or
something. But it's big, that's for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I would favor a children's show where a giant fire
ant devours Barney the Dinosaur, but that's probably another
example of my misguided thinking.
</P>

NETWORKING COMES HOME 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   For computer-owning families, the machines sometimes seem to fit
Ogden Nash's description of martinis: ``One is too few. Two is too
many. Three is never enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Some families started out with one computer. Fast when it was
bought, it became ``slow'' when the newer models were brought out.
So it sits on one desk, probably used for less demanding tasks, and
the family's new one sits on another. And, to use another famous
line, ``Never the twain shall meet.''
</P>
<P>
   For most uses, that's fine. When the need arises, the files from
one computer can be put on a floppy disk and taken to the other _
unless it's a file of a photograph that is too large to store on a
floppy. If both machines have a Zip, or similar drive with high
capacity, the ``sneakernet'' transfer system can still work.
</P>
<P>
   But things can become more complex. Say both computer users want
on the Internet _ at the same time. The additional expense of
bringing in another phone line can be expensive for installation
and continuing for a monthly fee.
</P>
<P>
   The time to network has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Hooking up two computers isn't as complicated as it used to be.
If you have Macs, the machines were designed to be linked easily.
In most households with two PCs, the two are probably running some
version of Windows. In the past year or so, networking computers
has become easier, thanks mainly to kits that direct home users
toward the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Costs vary, depending on the system used and whether you or a
computer store does the work. Plugging in two network cards and
running a cable between them is the quick and cheap way to do it
yourself and costs less than $100 for the network cards. Other
methods can start driving up the costs. Lugging the two computers
to a computer store and having technicians do the work is an
option, although the labor cost is a factor to consider.
</P>
<P>
   Once connected, two computers can share hard drives. One printer
can work for both computers. A scanner on one computer can capture
images that can be transferred to the second computer.
</P>
<P>
   If the computers are in the same room, the job will be less
daunting. If not, you may have to venture into the attic to run
wires or drill through a wall to install a telephone-like
receptacle to make the passthrough to the next room.
</P>
<P>
   However, some companies offer systems that work over a home's
electrical wiring. Particularly intriguing is a simple hookup from
a company that uses a wireless system that plugs into the printer
ports of the computers and can thus connect two computers located
up to 125 feet apart. I haven't tried the Aviator Wireless Network
yet, but will be testing it shortly.
</P>
<P>
   While it's possible for the piggyback computer to use the
Internet as long as the main computer is online, not all Internet
service providers _ including AOL _ allow two screen names to be
logged on at the same time under the same account.
</P>
<P>
   The October issue of Family PC magazine answers 20 questions
about home networking. It explains the alternatives and lists the
advantages (which I've touched on here.)
</P>
<P>
   The magazine also has an article on seven ways to upgrade an
existing computer, how to surf the 'net with children, and sites to
make Halloween even more spooky: www.unversalstudios.com/horror for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine also has an Internet site: www.familypc.com.

 SEEING STARR AS A RE-ENACTMENT OF MCCARTHY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the American cultural historian Ann Douglas was
deep into the 13th century for her doctoral dissertation at
Harvard, she discovered what she calls predecessors of the modern
media: the handmade books created by Roman Catholic priests in
England and France to record the religious visions of illiterate
peasants. As Ms. Douglas tells it, the peasants described their
visions, and the priests compiled them in books used to promote
their orders. ``It was that fundamental process,'' Ms. Douglas
said, ``by which the private becomes public.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then Ms. Douglas has continually rediscovered how often
that process occurs. In a body of work that covers almost a century
and a half of American history, Ms. Douglas has seen again and
again how the private has become public. To her, Kenneth Starr's
investigation into President Clinton's sex life is just the latest
example. Indeed, in her view (sharpened by a book in progress about
Cold War culture in the United States), Starr has picked up where
Sen. Joseph McCarthy left off.
</P>
<P>
   The criminalization of sexual behavior was born in the 1950s,
she said, ``when you had senators saying that basically
homosexuality was an indicator that someone was a communist.'' The
Starr investigation reflects nothing less than ``the victory of
Cold War aims revamped for the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel some sort of horrified sense of being caught in a
re-enactment,'' Ms. Douglas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think how happy he would be to be in Ken Starr's spot,'' she
added. (Ms. Douglas describes herself as a ``Democrat on the
left.'') ``He didn't dream of anything quite like this. And he
absolutely knew that Americans loved to see facts and documents. He
would have totally understood the 36 boxes. The visuals are very,
very similar here. Of course there are differences, but boy, are
there a lot of parallels.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Douglas, 56, is a professor of English and comparative
literature at Columbia University. She talked the other day in her
Riverside Drive apartment not only about Clinton, Starr and the
Cold War, but also about her struggle with alcoholism, her
religion, the 8,000 books in her apartment and her upper-class New
Jersey childhood in which ``Protestant theology survived only as a
belief in caste, polite manners and conventional behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   She rarely came up for air during the discussion and was
simultaneously dizzying, exhausting and riveting. Sometimes she
wandered off on entire expeditions away from the main point and
made intellectual leaps from Hannah Arendt to Marilyn Monroe to the
``horrifying'' stiletto heels and stiff hair of the 1950s American
woman, who looked, she said, like ``a miniature defense industry.''
</P>
<P>
   A former student, Patrick Horrigan, likens Ms. Douglas'
classroom style to performance art. David Damrosch, the chairman of
Columbia's English department, remembers that a student once told
him that Ms. Douglas' teaching style was so magnetic that it seemed
as if ``we're all going to heaven together.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Douglas' first book, ``The Feminization of American
Culture,'' published in 1977, argues that the Victorian era gave
birth to the first products of modern mass culture _ the romance
novels and women's magazines catering to the middle-class American
matriarch _ and that advances in printing made their distribution
far more widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrible Honesty: Mongrel Manhattan in the 1920s,'' her second
book, is a kind of sequel showing how black and white artists
revolted against the sentimentality of earlier eras and saw their
ideas more rapidly disseminated in movies, radio and the tabloid
press. In her Cold War book, ``If You Live You Burn: Cold War
Culture in the United States: 1939-1965,'' Ms. Douglas will argue
that the advent of television fed McCarthyism.
</P>
<P>
   The most sensational scandals and trials of 20th-century
America, Ms. Douglas said, have occurred in the three decades _ the
'20s, '50s and '90s _ that saw the creation of new media: radio,
television and the Internet. She pointed to the Scopes and Leopold
and Loeb trials of the 1920s, the Alger Hiss and Rosenberg trials
of the 1950s and now Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this whole medical theory that when surgeons develop
new tools,'' Ms. Douglas said, ``they overuse operations that will
test them. When mankind has new tools, he will think up the events
and the situations in which it can use them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Douglas is best known for ``Terrible Honesty,'' which took
15 years to write and which she said was delayed at least five
years by her alcoholism. (Ms. Douglas stopped drinking in 1988;
``Terrible Honesty'' was published in 1995.) ``I had to redo so
much of the work I'd done,'' Ms. Douglas said. She was haunted by
the people in the book _ F. Scott Fitzgerald, Dorothy Parker,
William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway _ whose drinking shadowed their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got in a cul-de-sac of not being able to see the characters
whole anymore because I was so caught up in the most negative parts
of their lives,'' she said. ``It wasn't that I was trying to be
like them, it was more that I was afraid that `How can it be that I
have all these people's problems without their genius?' It was more
this growing sense of horror that my whole life, a much less life,
was going to be consumed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Douglas attempted suicide twice, recovered and kept
drinking. Her turning point came on a beautiful autumn day a decade
ago when she was sitting in her living room, overlooking the
Hudson, and thinking, ``Very soon I'm going to be dead.'' But then
``this thought'' came into her mind, telling her not to surrender.
``Basically, I would call it my soul,'' she said. ``I certainly
hadn't heard from it for a while. Within 24 hours I was on the
phone to hospitals looking for treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Her Cold War book has ``a whole new batch'' of drinkers for her
to deal with: ``Charlie Parker! Bud Powell! Jack Kerouac! William
Burroughs!'' She laughed ruefully but said she could handle them
now.
</P>
<P>
   Her colleagues agree. ``The last few years have been an
extraordinary process of flowering for Ann,'' Damrosch said. ``It
was like a floodgate opened. She's just everywhere now; she's
constantly writing. There's a real electricity in the air when
she's around.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Douglas was married for a decade, divorced, then was
involved for 12 years with Jay Fellows, a professor at Cooper Union
and an alcoholic, who died of alcohol poisoning in 1990. She lives
alone, has no children and finds strength in what she calls the
spiritualism that came into her life after she stopped drinking.
(She was raised in the Dutch Reformed Church but now calls herself
generically a Christian.) Although Ms. Douglas does not go to
services, she says prayers in the evening and reads a small part of
the Bible each morning. ``It seems to work for me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She has decided that her recovery was not from her efforts
alone: ``I believe that something intervened in my life, and I
choose to call that God. I really don't know any other way to
describe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Douglas described herself as a public alcoholic _
``in my world, everybody knew I was an alcoholic'' _ she
nonetheless said she could not imagine having every aspect of her
past open for debate on the Internet. ``There's so much to be
embarrassed about _ take your pick,'' she said. With Starr's
dissemination of the details of the president's sex life, Ms.
Douglas said, ``It amazes me that people aren't thinking, `This
could be me.'''
</P>
<P>
   On a less somber note, Ms. Douglas said she was also irritated
that the four-hour broadcast of the president's grand jury
testimony cut into ``All My Children,'' which she has watched
regularly for 22 years. It started when Ms. Douglas began watching
the show with a friend who was having a nervous breakdown. The
friend was staying with her, and her doctor had recommended a soap
opera as part of her therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She recovered, went back to work, and I've been watching it
ever since,'' Ms. Douglas said cheerfully. ``I love narrative, and
soap is pure narrative. Meaning it will go on and on as long as
life. And it is, I think, kind of therapeutic.''

<P>
   HOUSTON _ After Dr. Ferid Murad learned he had won the Nobel
Prize for medicine Monday morning, he still set aside 30 minutes to
meet with the trainees and scientists in his lab to discuss some
``fantastic data'' that one had uncovered over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Those close to him say it is a mark of the man that he would
take time on such a day for the younger scientists he is training.
It also is proof of his wife's assertion that the Nobel will not
change him or divert him from his single-minded pursuit of what he
loves _ science.
</P>
<P>
   Murad, 62, put it more simply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a data freak,'' he confessed. ``I can't go a day without
hearing good new data.''
</P>
<P>
   The dogged pursuit of new information characterizes Murad and
his success, capped last week by science's most prestigious award.
Friends describe him as competitive, brilliant, unassuming and
mild. His wife calls him a ``regular guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Willerson, chairman of medicine at the University of
Texas Medical School at Houston, said he pushed for Murad's
recruitment as chairman of the school's new integrative biology
department because of that love of ``data'' _ particularly in his
field, dealing with biologic effects of a chemical called nitric
oxide.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Murad spent most of his adult life pursuing the mystery of the
colorless, odorless gas best known as an air pollutant. Although
most living creatures produce nitric oxide (not to be confused with
the dentist's nitrous oxide, or laughing gas), Murad and co-winners
Robert F. Furchgott and Louis J. Ignarro proved its fundamental
role in cells throughout the body.
</P>
<P>
   Their research showed how it can help unclog arteries and reduce
blood pressure, among other benefits. In small doses, nitric oxide
opens up the constricted pulmonary arteries in extremely premature
babies and allows their blood to be more fully oxygenated.
</P>
<P>
   Little remains controversial about it today. But for 18 years,
Murad fought for recognition of the tiny molecule's importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unexpected that a free radical would work like this,''
said Murad, who maintained his work and studies despite the world
of medicine's indifference to his efforts.
</P>
<P>
   That is typical of him, said a lifelong friend, Ronald Delismon
of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were playing chess with him and he was losing, he never
gave up,'' said Delismon. ``He made you beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1990s, nitric oxide's importance became clear. In
1992, the journal Science named it molecule of the year. In 1996,
Furchgott and Murad received the Lasker Award, often dubbed the
American Nobel.
</P>
<P>
   Murad, new to Houston and UT, hopes his new celebrity will bring
grants and top-notch younger researchers to the school. But he
hopes the Nobel will not change him.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Murad, his wife of nearly 40 years, is confident it won't.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will go on doing the things he loves,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The money from his share of the $978,000 prize will go toward
educating his five grandchildren and maybe to Indiana's DePauw
University, where he went on a full scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   One area of Murad's expertise that is ignored frequently is his
skill as a physician, his wife said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won the prize for the `Art and Practice of Medicine' when
he was in medical school'' at Cleveland's Case Western University,
she said. ``In 1976, when I had a pulmonary embolism (a blood clot
in the lungs), he diagnosed it before anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   His concern for patients was evident last week as he talked to
24-year-old Sharon Jones as she cradled her prematurely born baby,
James Michael, on her chest in the Turner Neonatal Intensive Care
Unit at Hermann Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Although its use is relatively new, nitric oxide is helping
save lives in such units across the country. In very premature
newborns, it can help reduce a life-threatening condition known as
pulmonary hypertension.
</P>
<P>
   Little Michael, born weighing 1 pound, 7.6 ounces, has not yet
had to have nitric oxide treatments. But his mother and father
drive in regularly from Splendora to cuddle the infant born three
months early at a hospital in Humble.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Murad's big body, hugged by the yellow cotton gown
required in such nurseries, dwarfed the young mother as she cradled
her infant.
</P>
<P>
   But he leaned forward to catch her soft words, and he was
cautiously encouraging as he elicited the story about how Sharon
Jones had dropped out of college when her baby was born, and now
spent hours each day holding him close. His father takes the
weekend duty, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got married when I was 19,'' she said. ``We wanted to wait
a few years to have children, but ...''
</P>
<P>
   Even though a medical school planning committee was awaiting
Murad's appearance downstairs, he seemed in no hurry as he talked
to Jones and toured the unit with Dr. John Sparks, chairman of UT's
Pediatrics Department.
</P>
<P>
   Murad's enthusiasm for the treatment options offered by nitric
oxide is almost boundless, but his face and voice soften when he
talks about the use in keeping newborns healthy and whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been a real shot in the arm for the school,'' said
Sparks. Already, Murad has been working with pediatric researchers
like Dr. Michael Fant and Dr. Bruce Alpert, whose interests in
infant development and care of critically ill children overlaps
that of Murad.
</P>
<P>
   His interest is not limited to children, but as the father of
five, he has been necessarily involved with the younger generation.
</P>
<P>
   All his youngsters are grown and gone, but Monday morning's
first hours were spent tracking them down and telling them about
his Nobel.
</P>
<P>
   Another of those early communications was with Delismon, a
retired Boeing engineer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so excited when I heard it on television,'' said
Delismon. ``I didn't even stay upstairs to hear the whole thing. I
ran downstairs and e-mailed him my congratulations.''
</P>
<P>
   The two grew up in Whiting, Ind., a town of 10,000 south of
Chicago. Their high school had only about 120 students in the
senior class.
</P>
<P>
   But the teachers were wonderful, said Delismon. ``They really
took an interest in us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Delismon, who describes his youthful self as 6 feet tall and 125
pounds, managed the swimming and football teams. Murad, he said,
lettered in track and football. Both were members of the men's glee
club and took roles in school and local operettas and musical
productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always smooth,'' said Delismon. ``He was voted best
dressed in high school. The dress then was slacks and sweaters.''
</P>
<P>
   At lunch, the pair would eat at a small restaurant run by
Murad's parents, John and Josephine, Delismon said. It was a
favorite with teachers and students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just a bunch of gunky kids 16 and 17 years old,'' he
said. ``But they went out of their way to take an interest in us.
It was absolutely amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Murad's father had emigrated from Albania when he was 16. His
wife was from St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they were living today, they would be so proud,'' said
Delismon. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Neither Murad nor Delismon were valedictorian or salutatorian,
but ``we were up there,'' said Delismon. They competed mercilessly.
If one got a 95 on a test, the other got a 100. After graduation,
many of the students took a college algebra course from Indiana
University, Delismon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was another competition,'' he said. ``Did you get a hundred
on the exam? What? Only a 99? You dummy!
</P>
<P>
   ``We aced that class, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought his friend would win the Nobel Prize,
Delismon said, ``Never.''
</P>
<P>
   When Murad first made his nitric oxide discovery almost 20 years
ago, he told Delismon that it was important and might lead to some
kinds of awards. His friend remembers what he told Murad later.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were the only one who thought this work was important,''
said Delismon. ``You never give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Murad's interest in nitric oxide began early in his career, and
he continued to work in the field even when others thought his
pursuit fruitless because nitric oxide acted contrary to what was
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Because it has one electron free, nitric oxide is known as a
free radical. It readily combines with other chemicals in the body,
and exists in a pure state no longer than 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But those crucial 10 seconds allow the gas produced by one cell
to penetrate the outer membrane and regulate the function of
another cell. It was the first time that a gas had been found to
act as a ``signaling'' molecule that turns on the functions of
other cells.
</P>
<P>
   Further work in the field showed that this so-called
second-message molecule provides crucial signals in the
cardiovascular and nervous systems. It fights infections, regulates
blood pressure and governs the flow of blood to different organs.
</P>
<P>
   Delismon understands the basics of his friend's work, but Murad
laughs when asked about Delismon's.
</P>
<P>
   Most of it was top-secret for the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd say, `I would tell you about it, but then I'd have to
kill you,' '' Murad said.
</P>
<P>
   Delismon said he knows what Murad will say when they meet next:
``I'm ahead, one Nobel to nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The two parted ways when they went to college. Murad went to
DePauw, Delismon to the University of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   After getting his bachelor's degree, Murad was almost ready to
go Washington University in St. Louis when a fraternity brother
told him about an M.D.-Ph.D. program at Case Western. He obtained
both his medical degree and a doctorate in pharmacology there.
</P>
<P>
   At the prestigious Massachusetts General Hospital, where he did
his internship and residency with Willerson, he also worked with
future Nobel laureate Dr. Joseph Goldstein of UT Southwestern
Medical School in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very bright and hard working,'' said Willerson. ``He is
committed to doing everything well. He wants everything around him
to be done at a high level. He is ambitious for the Health Science
Center and the Texas Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the same time, he is unassuming and shy.''
</P>
<P>
   And he is a regular guy, said wife Carol. Most people call him
``Fred'' rather than Ferid, an Albanian name his father gave him.
</P>
<P>
   ``And how many doctors do you know who have a radial saw in the
garage?'' asked his wife.
</P>
<P>
   He always has some kind building project, she said. He built a
garage at their Lake Tahoe home, she said, and a three-car garage
at their former place in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   He taught his son to build and fix the family cars. ``And,'' she
said, ``my oldest daughter can do a mean wallboard.''
</P>
<P>
   None of Murad's four daughters nor his son went into medicine,
although one is a medical editor and another a respiratory
therapist. ``I guess I scared them off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like many in the medical field, he has bounced from medical
school to medical school and even done a stint in the
pharmaceutical industry.
</P>
<P>
   He was at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville and at
Stanford University in California. In the early 1990s, he was vice
president for pharmaceutical research and development for Abbott
Laboratories in Illinois. ``Then I decided to create a biotech
company at the wrong time,'' he said. ``I spent most of my time
raising money.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not what he liked to do, and he left Molecular Geriatrics
Corp. in Lake Bluff, Ill., to return to academia where he could do
what he likes best _ research and teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really get my jollies when I go to the blackboard with my
trainees,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There they plan new experiments and mull over old ones. They
brainstorm new work that could take a couple of months or a couple
of years.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, his trainees are a new generation of Ferid Murad, just
as he is a product of the laboratories in which he was trained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look on my trainees as scientific offspring,'' he said. ``I
follow what they are doing, and many have done well. They are
scattered around the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very likely that he will grow his own Nobel Prize
winners here,'' said Dr. M. David Low, president of the UT Health
Science Center. ``It is one of our challenges to make sure that all
the conditions are there so he can.'' &QL;

hundreds of feet above, on the thin ribbon of rail. It had been a
day for my boy, who is a train nut. But the photos remind of the
rustling aspens, the mountains all around, the deep gorges,
trestles over mountain streams, inky tunnels, a doe on the hill,

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Chrysler threw a party here recently to mark the 15th
anniversary of the minivan _ a vehicle it invented.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment included film footage of the first
advertisement for a minivan, which featured the magician Doug
Henning. He demonstrated the innovative features like the
front-facing third-row seat, the sliding door for back-seat
passengers, the cargo bay and the low step into what he called the
``magic box.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the minivan has enchanted the American public. Every
year, about 1.2 million minivans are sold, and Chrysler, despite
the increasing number of new entries over the years from nearly
every major auto maker, still captures about 45 percent of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Now Honda has arrived at the minivan party with a new model, the
1999 Odyssey, which is just arriving at showrooms and is even more
magical than Chrysler's offerings. It's Chrysler's toughest
competition yet.
</P>
<P>
   Honda stuck with the Odyssey name, the same name as its first
minivan introduced in December 1994 as a 1995 model, which never
achieved much sales success. Despite the name, the new model bears
little resemblance to the quirky original.
</P>
<P>
   Much larger than its predecessor, the new Odyssey matches
Chrysler's long-wheelbase minvans, sold as the Dodge Grand Caravan
and Plymouth Grand Voyager, and Ford's Windstar in dimensions. Its
styling is in keeping with the most popular minivans, the
Chryslers, the Windstar and the General Motors family of vans.
</P>
<P>
   Though larger than its predecessor, the new, Canadian-built
Odyssey carries a smaller price tag than the previous Odyssey,
which was too small and underpowered to warrant its expensive cost.
The Odyssey starts at $23,615 with destination fees. With few
options because so many features are standard, it tops out at
around $26,000. That puts the Odyssey in the realm of most
mainstream minivans as they are popularly equipped.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Chrysler offers minivans that start under $20,000, but
that is for short-wheelbase models equipped with small engines. Add
the long wheelbase, one of the larger V6 engines, a four-speed
automatic transmission and other options and the price pushes up to
the mid-$20,000s. Likewise, the base price for the Ford Windstar,
which can be equipped with a small V6 engine instead of the
3.8-liter V6 that 90 percent of its buyers order, is less.
</P>
<P>
   Adventurous minivan designs _ typified by GM's previous
generation of vans, which resembled those popular minivacuum
cleaners _ have fallen flat as most buyers apparently prefer
conservative styling. The Odyssey does feature interesting creases
in its sheet metal, as with the lines that form a ``V'' on its
hood. The lines give its form distinctive definition compared with
the smooth, jelly bean surfaces of the Chrysler models.
</P>
<P>
   The new Odyssey features four doors, including two rear sliding
doors instead of the hinged doors of its predecessor. Both sliding
doors operate electronically on the top-of-the-line EX; they are
manual on the LX version. (I tested both.) The power doors can be
opened and closed by pushing toggle switches to the left of the
steering wheel on the dashboard as well as using buttons on the key
fob. Or, pull the handles and the doors electronically open, a plus
with independent children like mine who insist on opening their own
doors.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Odyssey, the magic show begins. The second-row seats
move sideways on tracks that allow you to create a bench seat or
separate them into two captain's seats. (The new Ford Windstar
offers a similar feature.) The seats are also completely removable.
The Odyssey seats seven passengers, and all have headrests and
three-point seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   Patterned after an airliner, the Odyssey is equipped with
individual lighting and air vents. A central control in front
allows the driver to turn off lights or adjust the air-conditioning
throughout the cabin. Power-operated rear quarter-windows open to
provide a breath of fresh air to back-seat passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Outfitted in high-quality, two-tone materials, the Odyssey,
available initially only with cloth upholstery, contains numerous
features to make family travel comfortable and convenient. A table,
designed after one in Honda's CR-V sport utility vehicle, stretches
between the front seats. Two cup holders big enough for water
bottles and coffee mugs are at the front of the table (another pair
pulls out from the center dash); two more extend rearward for
convenient access by passengers in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   When not in use, the table folds flat against the passenger seat
for clear passage to the rear of the van. Throughout the cabin, the
Odyssey contains more cup holders as well as loads of bins, pockets
and cargo nets for storage. Power outlets are situated in the
center console and in the rear cargo compartment.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite feature of the Odyssey _ the feature that sets the
Odyssey above all others, in my view _ is the third-row seat.
Removing the third-row seat of most minivans is a nearly impossible
task for one person. As a single mother, I don't even bother. In
the Odyssey, however, simply fold the seat's back forward, yank the
strap and the third seat does a disappearing act into a well in the
floor. The only danger is catching your fingers as the seat folds
into the floor.
</P>
<P>
   After a thorough cleaning of my garage and attic, I loaded the
back end of the platinum EX test model with old toys and clothing.
After delivering my haul to the Salvation Army, I returned the
third seat to its seating position and proceeded directly to the
soccer field for car-pool duty. Any other minivan would have
required a return home to reinstall the third seat.
</P>
<P>
   When the seat is upright, the well in the floor of the cargo bay
provides a large, secure area for cargo. After a shopping trip, I
loaded a large box in the well and placed grocery bags on top of
it. On trips, the well serves as a perfect location for an ice
chest and suitcases, leaving plenty of room for other items to be
stowed on top. With the third seat folded into the floor and the
second-row seats removed, one can haul a 4-by-8 sheet of plywood on
the flat floor or on top of the folded seats.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler argues that the design, which it has considered,
prevents installation of all-wheel drive. I contend, however, that
for most drivers, the Odyssey's front-wheel drive offers plenty of
traction for winter conditions. Plus, traction control is standard
on EX models.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Chrysler still offers the widest choice in minivans,
ranging from basic to luxurious, cheap to expensive. They come in
short or long wheelbases, with different engines and transmissions
and with front-wheel or all-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   The Odyssey, except for the two trim levels, comes with
relatively few choices, but it is loaded with standard features.
It's only engine is a smooth, quiet 3.5-liter V6 rated at 210
horsepower, more than any minivan on the market, for confident
cruising at highway speeds. Its 229 foot pounds of torque, exceeded
only by the new Ford Windstar, comes in handy for quick getaways at
traffic lights. The engine is paired with a four-speed electronic
transmission that shifts almost imperceptibly.
</P>
<P>
   The Odyssey's four-wheel independent suspension provides a
smooth, quiet ride. As do most recent vintage minivans, the Odyssey
handles as a much smaller vehicle would. While handling is by no
means like that of a sports car, the Odyssey provides plenty of
grip around curves. It is nimble and maneuverable in squeezing into
parking spots. The Odyssey is equipped with large brakes, which
provide confidence in stopping; and anti-lock brakes are standard.
</P>
<P>
   The list of standard features is long: air- conditioning, theft
deterrent, cruise control, audio system with cassette. The EX adds,
among other items, a power driver's seat, an audio system with CD
player, automatic climate control and Homelink to open garage doors
and security gates by remote control. Only side air bags are
noticeably absent.
</P>
<P>
   With only one plant to Chrysler's two, Honda doesn't have the
volume to ruin Chrysler's minivan party, but it likely will steal
some of Chrysler's cake.  &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Last December, when Microsoft Corp. insisted that
the Windows 95 operating system wouldn't work without its Internet
browser, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson decided to
find out for himself.
</P>
<P>
   With help from a courtroom technician, the judge was able to
``uninstall'' his own Explorer Internet browser in about 90
seconds. With that, Jackson ordered the software giant to begin
selling Windows 95 separate from its browser.
</P>
<P>
   While that order was overturned on appeal _ leading eventually
to the new Justice Department suit against Microsoft based on the
Windows 98 software that goes to trial Monday _ Jackson's dive into
the technical aspects of the case is indicative of his approach to
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom calls it like he sees it,'' says James Schaller, his
former law partner at Jackson &AMP; Campbell in Washington. ``That's
his signature. Most people respect him for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, 61, will be presiding over what has been billed as the
antitrust lawsuit of the decade. The suit pits the Justice
Department and the attorneys general of 20 states against
Microsoft, the world's leading software company. At issue: Whether
Microsoft has used its dominance in the market for personal
computer operating systems to stifle competition in application
markets such as Internet browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is no newcomer to the national spotlight. The burly
white-haired judge was appointed to the bench in 1982 by President
Reagan. In 1991, he sent Washington Mayor Marion Barry to jail for
cocaine possession. Three years later, he ordered former Sen. Bob
Packwood, R-Ore., to turn over sex-filled diary entries to a Senate
Ethics Committee. And last year, he fined Reagan's former aide
Michael Deaver $100,000 for lying about lobbying activities.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's Washington roots run deep. He grew up in the city's
affluent suburbs, attending the exclusive St. Alban's School. He
sang for the Washington Cathedral Choir.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to Dartmouth College. Upon graduation, he joined the
U.S. Navy as a line officer, spending three years aboard a
destroyer in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. He returned to Harvard
University Law School, graduating in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Washington, Jackson worked with his father, Thomas
Searing Jackson, a well-known Washington lawyer, at a predecessor
firm to Jackson &AMP; Campbell. The father of two grown daughters, he
loves sailing and spends weekends in St. Mary's County, Md.
</P>
<P>
   In the hallways of the U.S. District Court, prosecutors and
defense attorneys say Jackson is an affable, able judge who runs a
tight ship. A former litigator, he's considerate of the time
pressures on overworked lawyers. Also, he's been known to show
compassion for those sentenced. One defense attorney recalls
Jackson using flexibility in sentencing a former military medic who
served in Panama. The reason: The man had served his country during
war without a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Jackson is not without critics. The gossipy
Washingtonian magazine lambasted him in 1996, calling him one of
Washington's worst judges. In 1995, the trade publication Legal
Times took him to task for moving slowly and calling long lunch
breaks. A 1993 Legal Times analysis, however, showed that his
reversal rate was about 18 percent. And former clerks describe the
judge as a warm, mentoring boss who takes a personal interest in
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   No one denies he has a tough side. Jackson repeatedly has gone
head-to-head with Microsoft. Following the browser incident, he
threatened the company's lawyers with contempt sanctions because he
said they defamed a court-appointed expert, Lawrence Lessig. Lessig
is no longer serving as the court's special master in the Microsoft
case.
</P>
<P>
   In the trial, Jackson is expected to show his signature
tenacity, digging deep into the technical merits of the case. He's
unlikely to stray beyond established law.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very fair,'' said Michael Volkov, an assistant U.S.
Attorney in Washington. ``But he'll enjoy a hard-fought trial.''

MILITARY SEEKS TO ASSUAGE CONCERNS OVER ANTHRAX VACCINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 18) (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ten months after the Pentagon announced plans to
inoculate 2.4 million troops against the deadly anthrax disease,
the military is combating widespread anxiety that the vaccine might
cause sterility, cancer or the mysterious Gulf War Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   The military has mounted an extensive information campaign using
the Internet, fliers and one-on-one consultations between
commanders and their units to convince service members that the
anthrax vaccine is safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anthrax is a biological weapon. Anthrax is highly lethal.
Vaccination against anthrax is critical for your protection,'' says
a brochure issued to military personnel entitled, ``What everyone
should know about the anthrax vaccine.''
</P>
<P>
   Each service and the Coast Guard has established Internet home
pages dedicated to anthrax immunization.
</P>
<P>
   On the Army's anthrax website, Defense Secretary William Cohen
is quoted as saying: ``Vaccination against anthrax is a safe,
prudent force-protection measure.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to address a major concern among female troops _ that
the vaccine might harm a developing fetus _ the Air Force anthrax
home page carries comments by Dr. Steve Ostroff, associate director
for epidemiologic science at the National Center for Infectious
Diseases, that ``there are no special risks associated with this
vaccine if by chance it is given to someone who is pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Pentagon advises pregnant women not to be inoculated,
but that warning applies to any vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps predicts that in future conflicts ``anthrax is
the biological weapon most likely to be encountered because it is
highly lethal, easy to produce in large quantities, relatively easy
to develop as a weapon, easily spread in the air over a large area,
easily stored and dangerous for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to reassure troops, Cohen and Army Gen. Henry
Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in May that
they themselves have begun taking the six shots required over an
18-month period.
</P>
<P>
   In nature, anthrax is caused by bacteria that infect grazing
animals such as cattle, sheep and goats. Iraq's Saddam Hussein is
suspected of producing anthrax spores in a dry form for use in an
artillery shell that could explode and spray death over a
battlefield. Within one to six days after inhaling spores, a victim
would get a high fever that ultimately would cause total organ
failure.
</P>
<P>
   Last December Cohen announced his intention to vaccinate all
active-duty and reserve personnel over seven years because of fears
that Iraq and other nations might use anthrax against U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Pentagon started the vaccinations on troops in the
Persian Gulf region, and in August the military began widespread
vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
   But the American Gulf War Veterans Association has asserted that
the vaccine, which is manufactured by Bioport Corporation in
Lansing, Mich., is potentially harmful.
</P>
<P>
   The group has advised service members ``to insist on being
exempted from the vaccine'' and to ``consider objecting to the
vaccine on religious grounds.'' It cited the company's own product
information that says no studies have been done to determine
whether the drug might cause cancer or infertility over a long
period.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon and FDA insist there are no indications that the
anthrax vaccine, which has been given since 1970 to veterinarians
and livestock workers, causes severe health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Bioport's chief operating officer, Robert Myers, adds that ``the
28 years of experience, as well as the experience of the last few
months with 200,000 doses, speaks resoundingly and clearly that
vaccine is safe.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a presidential advisory committee ruled it
``unlikely'' that there is a link between the vaccine administered
to Gulf War troops and the so-called Gulf War Syndrome that has
caused crippling joint pain and neurological disorders.
</P>
<P>
   As for near-term health risks, military medics have recorded few
adverse reactions to the more than 201,000 inoculations given since
March.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been unable to relate any but local soreness kinds of
side effects to the vaccine itself,'' said Susan Bailey, assistant
secretary of defense for health affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Turner, a Pentagon spokesman, added that ``one guy got a
severe inflammation, but he has recovered and is back on duty.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 service members have refused the shots so far, and
one of them has been discharged, Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   The shots are, in fact, mandatory. ``We consider service members
getting the shot in the same way we tell them to wear their
helmets,'' said Rear Adm. Michael Cowan, director for medical
readiness on the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While military and federal drug officials insist that the
vaccine is safe, many troops are not convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son recently married and he's worried that these shots will
hurt him,'' said the mother of a young Marine based in California.
``And I'm worried for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the anxiety stems from production problems that have
dogged Bioport, the nation's only supplier of the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the FDA cited Bioport for ``significant deviations''
in proper production techniques and concluded that ``a lot of work
remains to correct the deficiencies.''
</P>
<P>
   A report on an FDA inspection of the facility showed problems
including poor quality control and record-keeping.
</P>
<P>
   John Taylor, the FDA's senior adviser for regulatory operations,
wrote Myers on April 7 that it was ``critically important'' that
the company ``meet the requirements and applicable standards in
your license as soon as possible for the future manufacturing of
these products.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in January the company voluntarily suspended production
of the vaccine to upgrade its manufacturing facilities. The company
and the FDA say the suspension did not result from the FDA warning.
Production is expected to resume next January.

BOLSTERED BY VICTORIES, CLINTON LAUNCHES INTO UNCERTAIN DEMOCRATIC
CAMPAIGN SEASON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Bolstered by victories at home and abroad, President
Clinton decried Republican partisanship Friday as he launched into
an uncertain campaign season for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress comes to a close next week with the president
having defied the pundits by not only remaining in office, albeit
under threat of impeachment, but being emboldened by a week of
successes and favorable polls.
</P>
<P>
   Only a week ago, the Republican-led House voted to begin an
impeachment inquiry of Clinton stemming from his extramarital
affair with Monica Lewinsky and his efforts to keep it secret.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, it was Clinton who was on the offensive: agreeing
to a budget deal with Congress, helping to head off a military
conflict in Kosovo and bringing together the Israeli and
Palestinian leaders for peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight days of progress cannot totally erase eight months of
partisanship,'' Clinton said in a Rose Garden appearance with
Democrats from Capitol Hill at his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know that in those eight months of partisanship, too
many dreams of too many families were deferred. The Republican
majority is now leaving town to campaign, but they're also leaving
a lot of America's business unfinished,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his first legislative priority in 1999 will be
passage of a patients' bill of rights measure killed by Congress.
He also pledged to fight for other issues rejected by Republicans
such as a school construction measure, minimum wage increase,
campaign finance reform and anti-tobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
   With a historic low turnout being predicted, Clinton exhorted
voters to take ``a trip to the ballot box.''
</P>
<P>
   The president himself left the capital immediately after his
statement, flying here to raise money for an embattled Democrat,
Illinois Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, greeted outside the event by scores of demonstrators
calling for his impeachment, told Mosely-Braun's supporters that
the new budget deal pending in Congress looks like it was crafted
by Democrats. He claimed credit for the increases in education,
payments to the International Monetary Fund and protections for the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a dizzying week, but a wonderful week for our
country,'' Clinton said, citing the budget, Kosovo, the Middle East
and the Nobel Peace Prize for the key players in the Northern
Ireland peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton canceled a second fund-raising event in St. Louis to
return to Washington to huddle again with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tendency in the press to overwrite how much trouble
he's in or how well he's doing,'' said Doug Sosnik, a presidential
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Sosnik recounted the half dozen times in the past six years that
Clinton has been declared politically dead: from the lost battle to
reform health care in 1994 to speculation early this yea that he
would be impeached by Labor Day over the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the hallmarks of his presidency is the desire of his
enemies and some members of the press to declare his presidency
over,'' Sosnik said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Buchanan, a political science professor at the University
of Texas at Austin, said, ``It is fair to say, it's probably true,
that people expected more of a weakening as a consequence of the
Lewinsky matter than there actually was.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan noted Clinton remained able to use the bully pulpit,
repeating his education agenda ``250 times'' in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, whether Clinton's momentum can transfer to Democrats on
Nov. 3 Election Day remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably still too early to tell whether it affects the
base Democratic vote,'' said Rep. Gene Green, D-Texas. He noted the
Republican base vote, their core constituents, are ready to go to
the polls while Democrats ``have to really be motivated to turn
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats can take heart in nationwide surveys indicating public
is becoming increasingly dismayed with Republicans' handling of the
impeachment issue.
</P>
<P>
   Green said Republican impeachment inquiry debate was ``not
fact-finding as much as it's political and the American people are
reflecting that.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said Clinton's momentum could potentially help
Democrats because of a renewed focus on the agenda favored by the
president and his party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the president's problems this year, people forgot
what they already knew: A). Republicans are out of the mainstream,
and B). they've not been able to demonstrate an ability to govern
since they took over (Congress),'' Sosnik said.
</P>
<P>
   With the election less than three weeks away, Clinton still has

   The New York Times News Service plans the following articles
from the Style section for use Sunday, Oct. 18, and thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   PARIS-FASHION (Paris) _ Men, naked but for a diaper, writhing
sensually like Nijinsky on a bed of pink rose petals, are not what
a fashion-show audience comes to see. But few would be telling the
truth if they claimed that they minded this backdrop to the bounty
of airy, magical dresses and redoubtable slithery suits that were
the John Galliano collection. By Constance C.R. White.
</P>
<P>
   FIELDS-RICHARD (Undated) _ On Wednesday night, a double-A list
of the friends and clients of Bertram Fields gathered at the ``21''
Club to offer congratulations. Another legal victory for the
swashbuckling Hollywood attorney? Not exactly. This time, Fields,
who has done legal battle on behalf of Tom Cruise, James Cameron,
the Beatles and nearly every major film studio, was being feted for
a scholarly book in defense of an altogether different client,
Richard III. By Andrew Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   ROLEX-ENVY (Undated) _ Rolex is the main noun in the
international language of success. A writer reflects on his 30-year
wait to buy one, and now ``I'll probably die with this one on.
Unashamed.'' By Stephan Talty.
</P>
<P>
   GRACE-SLICK (New York) _ Somehow the Palm Court at the Plaza
Hotel, with its harpist and doilied dessert plates, seems like the
last place where Grace Slick would want to meet. But here she
comes, dressed mostly in black, looking startlingly like herself
even though the Feed Your Head Queen of Jefferson Airplane, the
voice that launched a thousand trips with her 1960's anthem ``White
Rabbit,'' turns 60 next year. Judging from how good she looks,
either she took far fewer drugs than anyone imagined, or the
cosmetics industry should start marketing an LSD eye cream. By Alex
Witchel.
</P>
<P>
   GLAM-ROCK (New York) _ Gabe Doppelt was scrambling. As VH-1's
creative director of fashion, Ms. Doppelt co-produces the cable
music channel's annual Fashion Awards, and each year she
commissions designers to create outfits for the show's opening,
purportedly around a rock-related theme. But, she admits, ``Every
year I look for the appropriate collision of fashion and music, and
I never really find it.'' This year promised to be no different,
until Ms. Doppelt heard that a movie about the glam rock movement
had won an award at the Cannes film festival, and her antennae
began buzzing. By David Handelman.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ Some worthy plants are victims of
gardeners' prejudice, among them marigolds because of their scent,
goldenrod because it resembles ragweed and gladioluses because they
are so often the flower of choice at funerals. By Cass Petersen.

BUDGET VOTE POSTPONED FOR REVIEW BEFORE MIDWEEK VOTE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress postponed until next week a vote on its
final 1999 spending agreement with President Clinton to allow time
to have the massive bill printed and to give members a chance to
review it.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in the House and Senate said Friday a vote
would be taken Tuesday or Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Congress approved another short-term funding
measure to keep the government running through early next week. The
stopgap bill, the fifth that Congress has passed since the start of
the new fiscal year on Oct. 1, replaces another interim funding
measure that expired Friday at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Republican and Democratic leaders predicted that the final
spending bill, worth nearly $600 billion, would pass with
overwhelming support. But some Republicans expressed concern that
angry fiscal conservatives in the GOP might revolt. They say the
bill is filled with pork-barrel projects and drains more than $19
billion from projected surpluses of about $131 billion over this
year and next.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of disappointed members,'' said one Republican
official. ``I think the more they read through this thing, the less
likely they are to vote for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were less worried about defections, since the
agreement contains an increase in education funding earmarked for
hiring new teachers. The Democrats have sought to make the
modernization of the public school system a key theme in this
year's congressional campaigns. They believe the extra $1.2 billion
designated as seed money for the president's plan to hire 100,000
more teachers could help them.
</P>
<P>
   In a Rose Garden ceremony Friday, Democratic lawmakers gathered
with Clinton to celebrate what they called the ``hard-won gains''
for education and other programs they hope to turn to their
advantage in the Nov. 3 election. They used the event to play up
the Republicans' refusal to go along with the administration's
request for more money to help build up to 5,000 new schools.
</P>
<P>
   After laying out disagreements over issues ranging from
education and health care, Clinton called on voters not to abandon
the Democrats, who are expected to lose to Republicans in many of
the close races around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Staying home is not an option when so much is riding on a trip
to the ballot box,'' Clinton admonished Democratic supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans also tried to cast the agreement as an
election-year victory for their members. In a speech on the House
floor, House Speaker Newt Gingrich outlined some of the reasons
that GOP lawmakers ought to vote for the bill and defend it as they
campaign for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   He touted the nearly $10 billion included in the bill for extra
defense-related spending as ``the first real increase'' in Pentagon
funding since 1985. He emphasized that Republican negotiators
insisted that the new teacher hiring money in the agreement be
controlled by local officials rather than the federal Education
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is going to win everything they want,'' Gingrich said.
But he called the budget deal ``the best agreement you can get when
you have a conservative Congress and a liberal president....I think
we can be very proud of this budget and I hope on Tuesday we have a
resounding vote of support for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote next week on the budget agreement will be the last
remaining business for the 105th Congress, unless it's called into
special session. Although Congress technically will be in
adjournment, the House Judiciary Committee will convene after the
Nov. 3 election to begin its impeachment inquiry against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But it's unlikely the whole House would have to return to
Washington to take any action related to the inquiry unless the
panel recommends that a vote be held on whether to impeach the
president. &QL;

POLL SHOWS PRI CANDIDATE FAVORED IN TAMAULIPAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PHILIP TRUE  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Results of a poll released here Friday show
Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, is
virtually assured of retaining the governor's seat in this month's
elections in the northeastern state of Tamaulipas.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI's Tomas Yarrington Ruvalcaba was favored by 56 percent
of those polled, while 18 percent said they support Gustavo
Cardenas Gutierrez of the center-right National Action Party (PAN).
Joaquin Hernandez Correa, of the center-left Democratic Revolution
Party (PRD), was favored 11 percent of those surveyed, said Jesus
Flores Aguilar.
</P>
<P>
   Flores is executive adviser to the University of Guadalajara's
Center of Opinion Studies, which conducted the poll on Oct. 10 and
11. The sampling of 1,400 voters has a margin of error of plus or
minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Results were virtually identical to a survey one month ago,
Flores said. The election is Oct. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Antonio Trujeque, a political analyst at the Colegio de la
Frontera Norte in Matamoros, said that despite a general decline
across the rest of Mexico, the PRI's strong showing in Tamaulipas
is not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI built its strength over the years with the guaranteed
loyalty of the labor and peasant votes,'' Trujeque said.
</P>
<P>
   ``While that loyalty is now slipping away in other parts of the
country, it is still strong here in Tamaulipas, and especially so
at state election time,'' he said of the state that skirts the
Texas border.
</P>
<P>
   Following a stunning victory by PAN in state elections in
neighboring Nuevo Leon last year, PRI members in Tamaulipas
realized they needed to work harder than ever to ensure victory,
Trujeque said.
</P>
<P>
   Yarrington has proven a strong candidate, with the support of
current PRI Gov. Manuel Cavazos Lerma, and has unified the state
party, which appeared bitterly divided after Yarrington defeated
another candidate favored by President Ernesto Zedillo in a primary
two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas, the former mayor of the state capital, Ciudad
Victoria, and the son of Jorge Cardenas, who in 1980 became the
first opposition mayor ever elected in Matamoros, was expected to
run stronger, Trujeque said.
</P>
<P>
   But organizational problems within his campaign and a somewhat
undependable middle-class base for PAN weakened his effort.
</P>
<P>
   While Hernandez has strong name recognition in the southern port
cities of Ciudad Madero and Tampico, the PRD is just getting
started in Tamaulipas and has not offered a strong campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Trujeque said Yarrington's coattails seem broad and could result
in a near clean-sweep of mayoral races across the state.
</P>
<P>
   PAN now holds the mayoralty of Matamoros and Tampico, while the
PRD has won in Ciudad Madero twice in the past six years.

 &HT;    FOR CLINTON, A GREAT WEEK ENDING A TERRIBLE YEAR
 &HT;    950&AMP;insert.
 &HT;    With CONGRESS-RECORD.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton mixed the powers of the bully
pulpit this week with his remarkable resilience in the polls to win
substantial portions of his populist agenda from an adversarial
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   On issues as varied as funding for international economic
bailouts, hiring elementary school teachers and expanding aid to
farmers, Clinton managed to pry a host of concessions from a
Republican-led Congress, even as he worked to end bloodshed in
Kosovo and broker an accord for peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   He even managed _ with the help of Republican infighting and the
threat of a presidential veto _ to turn back a House effort to cut
taxes in an election year, which Clinton said would squander tens
of billions of dollars of the first federal budget surplus in 29
years.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad, some might say, for a man who just the week before
became the third president in American history to become the
subject of a formal impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, this has been a very good week for the president,''
said political scientist Stephen Wayne, a Georgetown University
professor. ''He testified to his vitality and relevance as
president. He's still the president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as measured against the bold vision Clinton outlined
for the country in January, this has been largely a year of lost
opportunities for the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco legislation, campaign finance reform, health care
reforms and a hike in the minimum wage _ four popular, if
controversial, priorities that Clinton pledged to fight for in his
State of the Union address nine months ago _ were killed on Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's vow to deny Iraq the ability to build weapons of mass
destruction simply melted away after President Saddam Hussein first
dodged the threat of U.S. air strikes, then later asserted that he
would no longer submit to United Nations weapons inspections
mandated under the terms of Baghdad's Persian Gulf War surrender.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton's quest for so-called ''fast track'' trade
negotiating authority was never seriously taken up in a Congress
deeply divided over the broad issues of economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, as Clinton assembled his party's congressional
leadership for a round of election-year congratulations in the
sun-dappled Rose Garden, the victory was decidedly bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   Between his personal troubles over Monica Lewinsky and his
political difficulties on Capitol Hill, Clinton is approaching the
midpoint of his second term at risk of having to settle for
comparatively small gains instead of the big-picture changes he
once hoped might frame his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's really sacrificed any kind of larger vision to the
politics of the ad hoc, the bargain, the transaction,'' said Erwin
Hargrove, a presidential scholar at Vanderbilt University in
Nashville. ''He hasn't been able to really capture people's
imagination about big things he wants to do.''
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Last January, the week after allegations first surfaced that he
had an affair with Lewinsky, Clinton delivered a stirring State of
the Union address in which he outlined a bold vision of the
country's future and laid out an ambitious Democratic road map to
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Key pillars included legislation:
</P>
<P>
   _ To spike cigarette taxes in a deal that Democrats hoped would
bring in some $25 billion a year in new revenues.
</P>
<P>
   _ To end perceived abuses in campaign financing.
</P>
<P>
   _ To raise by $1 the $5.15-an-hour minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   _ To provide new health care guarantees for more than 50 million
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The agenda would have been ambitious at any time. Indeed,
Clinton's troubles with Lewinsky made it politically imperative
that the speech appear as visionary as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ''All at once, the purpose of the State of the Union message was
to contrast Clinton as president with Clinton's personal
behavior,'' said Wayne. ''It served, in a sense, a different
purpose for him.''
</P>
<P>
   It would have been difficult, during the best of times, for
Clinton to lead his party to victory in those areas against a
Republican-led Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The question haunting the White House is how much better his
chances might have been if Clinton had not been hog-tied by
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly he had no political capital with which to push those
goals,'' said Wayne. ''Had the Lewinsky thing not broken, he might
have.''
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   What Clinton demonstrated in the past week, though, was that
he's neither crippled by scandal nor prepared to live out the rest
of his term in a state of political atonement and personal shame.
</P>
<P>
   He retains all of the constitutionally endowed powers of his
office, including the authority to veto spending bills and other
legislation that makes its way to his desk.
</P>
<P>
   His Republican foes may have the upper hand on Capitol Hill, but
unless they confound all expectations to win veto-proof majorities
in November elections, they'll continue to have to bargain with
Clinton and the party he represents.
</P>
<P>
   A modern president, however, governs largely from the podium,
using the presidency and the unlimited store of props the office
provides as a stage for pressing his agenda and selling his
programs to the public, all the better to influence balky members
of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''A president's powers are basically powers of persuasion,''
said retiring Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind. ''His powers of persuasion
with Republicans, to a large number of them at least, are
reduced.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Clinton _ whose job approval ratings have remained
above 60 percent for most of the year _ has been able to use the
voice of public opinion to amplify his own message to reluctant
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he's riding high,'' Hamilton said, ''the politicians in the
Congress respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   If they don't respect it, Clinton challenged them this week to
fear it.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks away from midterm elections _ in which all 435
House seats and one-third of the 100-seat Senate are up for grabs _
Clinton is arguing hard that each defeat handed to him by
Republicans was a net loss for the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''Partisanship killed the Patients' Bill of Rights,'' Clinton
said on Friday. ''Partisanship killed our efforts to help students
stuck in crumbled and overcrowded school rooms,'' he said,
referring to the defeat of a White House proposal for $5 billion
over the next five years for elementary school construction and
repair.
</P>
<P>
   ''Republican partisanship killed an increase in the minimum
wage,'' he continued, ''partisanship killed our best chance at
bipartisan campaign finance reform ...and finally, let me say that
partisanship killed the comprehensive anti-tobacco legislation,
which would have saved millions of young Americans from painful and
premature
</P>
<P>
   death.''
</P>
<P>
   In a preview of what already promises to be a central theme of
his next State of the Union message this January, Clinton vowed to
fight hard, to restore those priorities to the agenda he means to
place before the incoming Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''By that time,'' said Vanderbilt's Hargrove, ''impeachment
politics will either be over, or we'll all be in a hell of a
mess.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Isolated severe thunderstorms produced hail and damaging winds
in parts of western Minnesota and the Dakotas on Thursday as low
pressure lifted unseasonably warm air over the region. Saturday,
showers and thunderstorms will erupt from Wisconsin to Texas as the
low and its attendant cold front push slowly eastward. Some of the
thunderstorms will be quite strong, especially over the Upper
Midwest, where a vigorous jet stream disturbance enhances rapidly
rising air currents. Behind the front, a chilly, soaking rain will
occur from northern Minnesota to the eastern Dakotas. Near the
western edge of this band of steady rain, snow will fall in the
Black Hills of South Dakota and in the higher terrain of eastern
Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, sprawling high pressure over Virginia will provide
sunshine and warm temperatures to much of the Eastern states. High
temperatures will be 10 to 15 degrees above normal in parts of the
Ohio and Tennessee valleys. The exception to the sunshine and
warmth will be in parts of New England, where high clouds will dim
the sunshine at times.
</P>
<P>
   Tranquil conditions will also prevail in much of the West.
Offshore winds near the California coast will drive low clouds out
to sea, insuring ample sunshine. Elsewhere, a weak storm system
will enter the Pacific Northwest, with clouds and scattered rain
showers west of the Cascades. The valleys of eastern Washington and
Oregon will be mainly dry with partial sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Recurving Typhoon &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After lashing Luzon, the Philippines, Typhoon Zeb has recurved
to the northeast over the past two days. Forecasters in the United
States always take note of a recurving typhoon in the western
Pacific because a forecasting rule maintains that colder air
typically arrives in the Northeast states five to seven days later.
The rule is fairly reliable, based on the idea that warm air
associated with the typhoon helps to build a ridge of high pressure
over the eastern Pacific, which, in turn, allows Canadian air to
slide into the Northeast. Computer forecasts indicate an invasion
of Canadian air by next Wednesday. &QL;

WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''

<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: PATIENTS
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Oct. 9, the Senate voted to block the ``Patients'
Bill of Rights.'' By a 50-47 vote, senators decided to table -- or
set aside for the year -- the legislation which would give patients
more rights when dealing with managed-care companies. Supporters of
the motion said the bill had become too politicized and disagreed
with the provision that would allow patients to sue their health
plans. Proponents of the patients' rights bill said it was an
important issue and the Republicans were being unfair by denying
them a chance to debate the bill. A ``yes'' vote favors setting the
bill aside for the year.

<P>
   On Friday, Oct. 9, the House approved, 300-125, a measure that
would revise bankruptcy laws to make it harder for individuals to
become debt-free by declaring bankruptcy. Supporters, who were
strongly backed by credit card companies, said too many people were
given a ``free ride'' by taking advantage of the current bankruptcy
laws. Opponents said the bill favored special interests, like
credit card companies, and would hurt people in dire straits,
including the elderly and hard-working families. A ``yes'' vote
favors the bill.

2 GET NOBEL PRIZE FOR EFFORTS IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain)  (Eds: See also NOBEL-IRELAND) 
(mk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The 1998 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded Friday to John
Hume and David Trimble, leaders of the largest Catholic and
Protestant political parties in Northern Ireland, for their efforts
to bring peace to the long-polarized British province.
</P>
<P>
   Hume, 61, the Catholic head of the Social Democratic and Labor
Party, was cited by the Nobel Committee in Oslo for having been
``the clearest and most consistent of Northern Ireland's political
leaders in his work for a peaceful solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, 54, the Protestant leader of the Ulster Unionists, was
honored for having demonstrated ``great political courage when, at
a critical stage in the process, he advocated solutions which led
to the peace agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   A leader of a third prominent party, Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein,
the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, was not named as a
prize winner. Nor were several other figures mentioned as
possibilities, including former Sen. George Mitchell, who led the
talks, Prime Ministers Tony Blair of Britain and Bertie Ahern of
Ireland, President Clinton, and Mo Mowlam, the British government's
secretary for Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The accord, signed on April 10 and known as the Good Friday
Agreement, has given the 1.7 million residents of Northern Ireland
a respite from the sectarian violence that has claimed more than
3,200 lives in the last 30 years. It has also opened the
possibility of lasting stability for the first time since the
establishment of Northern Ireland with partition from Ireland in
921.
</P>
<P>
   Forging concessions from fiercely antagonistic populations, the
accord seeks to balance the Protestant majority's wish to remain
part of Britain with Catholic desires to strengthen ties to the
Irish Republic to the south.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, seeing in Northern Ireland's two warring groups a
dispute with notable similarities to violent tribal confrontations
elsewhere, expressed the hope that the accord would serve ``to
inspire peaceful solutions to other religious, ethnic and national
conflicts around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   While it did not honor Adams, the committee said it wished to
``emphasize the importance of the positive contributions to the
peace process made by other Northern Irish leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the prize givers had ``shied away'' from Adams because
of his past association with violence, the chairman of the
secretive five-man committee, Francis Sejersted, said: ``We don't
shy away from anybody. We just try to pick the most worthy
people.'' Adams, he said, was ``clearly one of those who has
contributed significantly to the process so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams was almost certainly on the list of 139 nominees because
the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee Friday implied
strongly that it had considered him for the prize but decided to
limit it to Hume and Trimble.
</P>
<P>
   Nominations can be made by university professors, members of
national legislatures, former Nobel laureates, members of the Nobel
Committee and a number of other people considered qualified. The
committee itself releases the number of nominations but does not
identify the nominees or or even confirm a name.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the Nobel Committee included Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, as a prize winner with the Israeli leaders
Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres. One committee member, Kaare
Kristiansen, resigned in protest, calling Arafat ``a terrorist.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why the committee selected the two men from the
number of people associated with the Good Friday Agreement,
Sjersted said, ``There is one from the Catholic side and one from
the Protestant side, so I do not fear that it is going to alienate
any of the other parties in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams, in New York on a fund-raising trip for Sinn Fein,
welcomed the Oslo announcement and particularly praised Hume, who
is widely seen as having helped persuade the IRA to adopt a
cease-fire and having eased Sinn Fein's entry into the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, there would be no peace process but for his courage
and vision,'' Adams said, adding, `No one deserves this accolade
more.'' He also said the prize imposed on everyone the
responsibility to ``push ahead through the speedy implementation of
the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The immediate next steps are the creation in the new
power-sharing Northern Ireland Assembly of a 10-member executive
that will in effec be the new government of the province, and a
cross-border body linking the North with the Irish Republic, one of
the key attractions in the pact to the Catholic minority.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, who is the first minister of the new legislature, faces
pressure from dissidents in his quarrelsome party who insist that
the IRA must start disarming before Sinn Fein can take up the
positions in the Assembly that its vote total in June elections
entitles it to.
</P>
<P>
   In the unforgiving politics of Northern Ireland, the Unionist
dissidents and members of other Protestant parties who did not join
in the peace talks attacked both Trimble and Hume Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Paisley Jr., of the Democratic Unionist Party, called the
Nobel Committee's decision a ``farce'' and said of the winners,
``These people have not delivered peace, and they are not
peacemakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimble said Friday that he was ``slightly uncomfortable'' with
the award because so many other people had been involved beside him
in reaching the settlement and much remained to be done to put it
in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that while we have the makings of peace, it is not
wholly secure yet,'' he told the BBC from Denver, where he was on
an 11-city North American mission to spur foreign investment in the
province. ``I hope it does not turn out to be premature.''
</P>
<P>
   Hume received word of the prize at his home in Londonderry and
termed it ``an expression of the total endorsement of the work of
very many people.'' He added: ``This isn't just an award to David
Trimble and myself. It is an award to all the people in Northern
Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday was the second time the Nobel Peace Prize has gone to
figures in the Northern Ireland conflict. Betty Williams and
Mairead Corrigan, two Belfast women, won it in 1976 for mobilizing
Catholics and Protestants to stage rallies calling for an end to
violence. They acted after three children of Miss Corrigan's sister
were killed when they were struck by an IRA gunman's getaway car.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There had been strong speculation that the committee would
recognize the Ulster peace effort this year, and other names
figured in the conjecture. There were the two prime ministers,
Blair of Britain and Ahern of Ireland, who drove the faltering
talks to a conclusion and stayed up all night with the negotiators
as the deadline slipped from midnight April 9 into the next
afternoon. And in addition to Mitchell and Ms. Mowlam, there was
Clinton, who actively pressed the two sides to get together and
made critical phone calls to negotiators at Blair's request in the
final hours.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington Friday, Clinton said ``how very pleased'' he was,
``personally and as president, that the Nobel Prize Committee has
rewarded the courage and the people of Northern Ireland by giving
the Nobel Peace Prize to John Hume and to David Trimble.'' He added
``a special word of thanks'' to Mitchell, who issued a statement
praising Hume and Trimble as ``fully deserving of this honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Hume, nominated for the Peace Prize twice before, is widely
credited with being the single most important and consistent
influence for peace in Northern Ireland. For 30 years he has been
speaking out against violence, as a member of a short-lived
Northern Ireland assembly in the early 1970s and then as a member
of the British Parliament and the European Parliament. He has made
frequent trips to the United States to encourage investment in
Northern Ireland and to dissuade Irish-Americans from furnishing
money for the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Once a trainee priest and then a teacher, he became involved in
politics when the Catholic civil rights movement started in 1968.
He was a founder of his party in 1970 to represent ``nationalist''
sentiment. In Northern Ireland, a nationalist is someone wanting
closer ties and even union with Ireland but, unlike republicans,
unwilling to countenance bloodshed to reach the goal. On the
Protestant side, the two counterpart words are ``unionist,'' like
Trimble, and ``loyalist,'' the term for Protestant paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Hume began the process that led to April's settlement five years
ago, with a decision to meet secretly with Adams, an outcast among
nationalists because of his identification with the IRA. Those
talks led to a cease-fire in 1993 that prompted hopes for an end to
the violence. Those hopes were dashed 17 months later when the IRA
set off a bomb in the Canary Wharf financial district of London.
</P>
<P>
   Though he said he was devastated by the act, Hume pressed on,
and his efforts produced a second cease-fire and brought Adams to
the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, by contrast, is a late-comer to accommodation with his
opponents. A former law professor, he began his political life as
an enemy of the party he now leads and an agitator against the last
peace settlement, the Sunningdale Agreement, which died in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the hard-line ``vanguard'' movement at that time,
he said, ``I would personally draw the line at violence and
terrorism, but if we are talking about a campaign that involves
demonstrations and so on, then a certain amount of violence may be
inescapable.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Trimble, already a member of the British Parliament,
attracted much attention by leading Orange Order Protestant
marchers at Drumcree Church into a police formation set up to block
their path down an avenue in a Catholic neighborhood. When the
parade successfully reached the Orange Lodge hall in downtown
Portadown, he danced a jig of triumph with Paisley, the fulminating
preacher-politician with a history of fire-breathing speeches
condemning Catholic advances.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Trimble for party leader over a more moderate
official that same year was seen as a sign that the unionists were
digging in their heels and selecting their most combatively
conservative candidate.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Paisley, the reigning symbol of Protestant
intransigence, calls Trimble a traitor to the unionist cause. What
has brought Trimble into disrepute with some former allies and at
the same time made him a credible candidate for a Nobel Peace Prize
was his stance in the last year trying to persuade his party, whose
slogan has always been ``No Surrender,'' that the time had come for
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   This fall he met with Adams, an unthinkable act for a unionist
politician until now and one for which he was pilloried by
dissidents in his party. He now travels the province with Seamus
Mallon, the deputy speaker and a Catholic, by his side in an
expression of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has taken a political chance in identifying himself with
the process,'' Sejersted, the Nobel Committee chairman, said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The peace talks began in the summer of 1996, held in drab civil
service buildings behind the stately Stormont building in Belfast
where the new legislature created by the settlement is now meeting.
The negotiations eventually drew the participation of eight of the
10 Northern Irish parties, with many of the men around the table
convicted murderers and bombers who had emerged from prison with a
commitment to peaceful resolution to what for nearly a century have
been referred to wearily as ``the Troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   The paramilitary groups had also made the tactical decision that
violence would not secure their goals, a shared conviction that
gave these talks a chance for success that past fitful attempts at
settlement lacked.
</P>
<P>
   The peace talks moved in a desultory manner until Blair took
office in May 1997 and highlighted the cause of peace in Northern
Ireland as an early commitment. At his and Ahern's urging, the IRA
declared a cease-fire in July, and by September Sinn Fein was
permitted to join the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Blair also gave Trimble and Adams unprecedented access to 10
Downing Street, and the Ulster Protestants reported that they
obtained from Clinton the most sympathetic hearing they had ever
had from an American president, allaying their longtime suspicions
of Washington's bias in favor of the Catholic minority.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Friday from his Chequers retreat hailing the
participants in the Northern Irish settlement, Blair said the
lesson that Friday's awards taught was that ``political leaders
have to get out of their political boxes they have been in for
years and years and take risks for peace.''

 &HT;      CHINESE OFFICIALS BUGGED BY NEW TRADE RULE
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Ronald F. Eckstein  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 -- The damage Asian longhorn beetles are
doing to Chicago-area trees may be heartbreaking, but the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's plan to stem the destruction really
bugs Chinese trade officials.
</P>
<P>
   Effective December 17, all shipments to the United States from
China containing solid wood packing materials must be accompanied
by official certification noting the wood has been treated to kill
any six-legged stowaways.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic response to the rule was positive Friday morning, as
the USDA held the first of three public hearings on the subject.
Representatives from packaging companies and wood products
associations applauded the wisdom of not banning wooden packaging
of imports, and a manufacturer of plastic packing materials offered
to sell his wares to Chinese exporters.
</P>
<P>
   But Chinese officials used the forum to express their
displeasure with the imminent rule. Xia Hongmin, Director General
of the Department of Animal and Plant Inspection and Quarantine for
the People's Republic of China, and his six-person entourage were
in Washington to negotiate with American agriculture and trade
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Through a translator, Hongmin called the rule ``discriminatory
and unfair.'' He said Asian longhorn beetles have also been
discovered in packages from Japan and Korea. And 72 percent of
wood-boring pests intercepted at American ports came from European
packing materials, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Hongmin claimed the rule will seriously hinder trade between the
United States and China.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more than 1 million shipments exported to the USA
from China annually and 33 to 50 percent of the total shipments are
packed with wood materials,'' he said. ``It is very difficult for
China to implement and supervise the treatments on time due to the
lack of methyl bromide, infrastructures and skillful fumigators and
limitation of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the treatments are not carried out on time, the shipments
will not export normally, or cause delay of the shipments. The cost
of the shipments will rise ... It will seriously impact the
bilateral trade between China and the USA.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, he predicted, the price of Chinese imports to the
U.S. will rise dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   But USDA officials said Chinese fears are overstated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interim rule has been crafted in a way that will have the
least possible impact on trade with China,'' said Michael V. Dunn,
assistant secretary of agriculture, marketing and regulatory
programs at USDA.
</P>
<P>
   The last two public hearings on the rule will be held in
Seattle, Wash. and Long Beach, Calif. in early November.

 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Last May, after he held aloft the hands of John Hume
and David Trimble during a Belfast concert to support the political
settlement in Northern Ireland, U2's lead singer Bono stood off to
the side of the stage and regarded the two politicians with a wide
grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those boys,'' he mused, indicating Hume and Trimble with his
thumb, ``should win the Nobel prize.''
</P>
<P>
   Bono got his wish Friday when Hume, the visionary Catholic
pacifist who was the prime architect of the peace process, and
Trimble, the onetime hard-liner who led a wary Protestant community
to compromise with Irish nationalists, were awarded the Nobel Peace
Prize.
</P>
<P>
   The award was a vindication both of Hume's tireless efforts to
bring about peace and reconcilation and Trimble's bold departure
from the traditional ``No Surrender'' siege mentality of Protestant
unionists who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United
Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Friday in his native Derry, the cradle
of the Catholic civil rights movement of the 1960s, Hume said he
was humbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great honor not just for myself, but for David, and for
the people of Northern Ireland,'' said Hume, 61, leader of the
Social Democratic and Labor Party, which represents most Catholics
in Northern Ireland. ``This is a strong expression of international
support for the process and the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   While many consider Hume to be the moral and intellectual force
behind the peace process, the Nobel committee sought to balance the
prize by honoring Trimble as well. Hume was magnanimous in his
praise of Trimble, 54, a man for whom he had little liking before
this year. The two men will split the $963,000 that comes with the
prize.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble was in Denver with Hume's deputy and heir apparent,
Seamus Mallon, drumming up investment for Northern Ireland, when
the award was announced in Oslo. Trimble is the newly elected first
minister of the Northern Ireland Assembly, which was created by the
Good Friday Agreement approved overwhelmingly in May by voters on
both sides of the border that splits Ireland. Mallon is the deputy
first minister.
</P>
<P>
   While Trimble used a hard-line tack in 1995 to become leader of
the Ulster Unionist Party, which represents most Protestants in
Northern Ireland, he has demonstrated an increasingly pragmatic and
flexible approach to sharing power with Catholic nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Denver, he accepted the award while noting that more
compromise is needed before the process delivers a lasting peace.
``I hope very much this award doesn't turn out to be premature,''
he said, voicing his characteristic caution as against Hume's
optimistic tone.
</P>
<P>
   There was little surprise that the peace prize was awarded to
participants in the Irish peace process, which climaxed last April
with the Good Friday political settlement. More than 3,500 people
have been killed in Northern Ireland, including 29 as recently as
Aug. 16 in a car bombing that was the worst atrocity in the 29-year
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The Nobel committee cited peace efforts in Northern Ireland once
before. In 1976, it honored two women who created a grass-roots
peace group that later collapsed amid personality disputes. The
conflict, meanwhile, dragged on. This time, however, there is
political consensus, and all of the major paramilitary groups have
declared cease-fires.
</P>
<P>
   Hume and Trimble were among a sizable group of Nobel candidates
involved in the Irish peace settlement. They included British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, who made concessions that previous London
governments refused to make, and his Irish counterpart, Bertie
Ahern, who dropped his country's territorial claim over Northern
Ireland as part of the historic compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Also considered were George Mitchell, the former US senator from
Maine who chaired the talks that led to the Good Friday Agreement;
Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army, who led the republican movement away from
violence and into the political mainstream; and David Ervine, who
did for loyalist paramilitaries what Adams did for republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nobel committee decided to confer the award on the two
men who lead the largest parties representing the two main factions
in Northern Ireland: Catholic nationalists who aspire to unity with
the Irish Republic and Protestant unionists who want Northern
Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Hume and Trimble were lauded Friday by President Clinton, UN
General Secretary Kofi Annan, Blair, Ahern and Nobel laureate
Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there are others, too, who deserve credit for their
indispensable roles _ beginning with Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein
leader without whom there would have been no peace,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   While some described Adams' exclusion a snub, he praised the
winners and urged Trimble to be more flexible in his demand for the
surrender of paramilitary weapons by the IRA as a precondition to
forming a power-sharing Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's entirely within Mr. Trimble's gift as a leader of his
party to ensure that this is not premature,'' Adams told reporters
in New York, where he is visiting.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did Mitchell express disappointment, saying, ``Without
John Hume there would not have been a peace process. Without David
Trimble there would not have been a peace agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hume is known throughout the world as a statesman, Trimble
is not. The award was an extraordinary, international endorsement
of the prickly law professor who is hated by many Catholics for his
tough rhetoric and defense of the right of the Orange Order, a
Protestant fraternal organization, to march in Catholic
neighborhoods where they are not wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even some of Trimble's harshest critics have grudging
admiration for him and concede that he courageously risked the fate
of other Protestant leaders who were pushed from power for their
attempts to compromise with nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble has shown himself capable of leadership and compassion
since taking office as first minister. In August, he made a huge
psychological and political leap by attending in the Irish Republic
the funerals of three little Catholic boys who were among the 29
killed in Omagh by a Protestant republican splinter group's bomb.
When the priest welcomed Trimble from the pulpit, the grieving
Catholic congregation burst into spontaneous applause.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Boston, where she is visiting, Mary McAleese, the
first native of Northern Ireland to become president of Ireland,
praised Hume, one of her heroes, and Trimble, who was once a bitter
rival at Queen's University, where both taught law. In a thaw
symbolic of the peace process, Trimble and McAleese buried their
past animosities and greeted each other warmly at the funerals of
the little boys in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very well deserved recognition for the commitment of
both men,'' she said. ``Their goal has at times seemed impossible.
At times it even seemed unthinkable. But with their perserverance
they have succeeded in bringing us to a new situation of real hope.
This award will I hope give renewed determination to every one of
us to see the process through to a successful conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Nobel prize does not resolve Trimble's internal
problems, as he faces a party mutiny by hardliners who believe he
is ceding too much to Catholic nationalists without achieving IRA
disarmament. Trimble says that the IRA must begin turning in its
weapons before its political representatives in Sinn Fein will be
allowed to become part of the Northern Ireland Assembly's Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalists counter that there is nothing in the agreement that
mandates disarmament as a condition for government participation.
The decommissioning of weapons has become a major obstacle in the
fledgling, post-agreement Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   But Hume said that Friday's award was ``a clarion call to move
beyond the bickering and implement the agreement. The international
community is telling us to do it. We must do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hume was at home with his wife, Pat, when someone called to say
they heard on the news he had won the Nobel prize. He said he was
more humbled than euphoric.
</P>
<P>
   Yet those who know Hume well say that he had regarded the Nobel
prize as a culmination to a career that began on the streets of
Derry in the late 1960s, when Catholics modeled their civil rights
movement after that of blacks in the United States. Protestant
authorities tried to quash the movement violently, but their
heavy-handed tactics only breathed life back into what had been
until then a dormant IRA.
</P>
<P>
   While the violence flared, Hume was a singular, eloquent voice
for reason, insisting that the problem in Ireland was not a divided
island, but a divided people. At great risk to himself, and against
the wishes of most in his party, he reached out to Adams and helped
him divert the republican movement away from violence and into the
political mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Hume believed that once there was a cessation of violence and a
unified nationalist front, unionists would have no alternative but
to compromise and share power with Catholics. He also shares power
with his Catholic colleagues. Earlier this year, he stepped aside
to let Mallon become deputy first minister in the new assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded of Bono's wistful thinking last May, Hume laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he said, ``Bono's okay.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Onion blooms provide sweet lessons of life
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLUE RIDGE, Ga._Pregnant onion. The name, at least that common
name, is truly descriptive. I'd never had one of these houseplants
until a few months ago when I got one from Pat Sublett, owner of
Misty Mountain Gifts, which sells plants and garden accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the cabin, I put the ornamental onion in a sunny window,
where its strap leaves, more than two feet long, stream down to the
floor. Demonstrating how it got its name, it continues to produce
little offsets about the size of peas under the skin of the mother
bulb that sits above the soil. Each baby can sprout and become a
mother when it touches dirt.
</P>
<P>
   My mother plant, now a bit bigger than a golf ball, surprised me
recently; in a weeks-long process it bloomed, producing a
foot-long, leafless flower stalk with a lot of little star-shaped
flowers at its end.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed fitting to take the blooming onion back to Misty
Mountain for a celebration. This I did when the flowering was at
its zenith, on a recent night, after the shop had closed.
</P>
<P>
   In a world so filled with man-made razzle-dazzle, high
technology and automation, such celebrations comfort, reaffirming
the importance of simple, natural beauty. To be with friends and
watch the opening of an iris or a night-blooming cereus, to admire
the bloom of a pregnant onion, is to understand that nature rules.
Nothing we can manufacture can do what plants do. No machine can
make blossoms. Or produce the color of autumn leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Pat, Dianne Lee, co-owner of a custom gift basket business
called The Basket Case of Blue Ridge, and I pulled up seats, sipped
wine, nibbled light hors d'oeuvres and talked, while the onion sat
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   As we admired it, Pat said, ``You ought to see the mama,''
explaining that the mama, her first pregnant onion, has grown
zaftig during the 15 years they've been together, producing many
little onions.
</P>
<P>
   Pat, who used to be senior buyer at Pike Family Nurseries, where
she worked from 1970 until 1995, opened her own business here last
year, selling onion babies harvested from the mother plant at home.
``I kept every one of them and stuck them in the soil,'' she said.
``I don't like to throw away anything.''
</P>
<P>
   So now, little onions grow among the herbs, perennial flowers,
containers and other items at Misty Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, my onion, in its little clay pot, stayed for
about an hour before I put it on the front seat of my car and
headed back through the sharp mountain air toward the cabin in
McCaysville, some 10 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration did wonders. Like all such times when we stop
doing the ordinary things we have to do and experience something at
once as simple, yet profound, as staring at a bloom, we relax
profoundly.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the celebration focused attention on blooms beyond the
onion's, making me think of many others I've known, all those I
have yet to see and appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   So much from such a little plant. One with such a big botanical
name: Ornithogalum caudatum. As much as I have gotten from this
plant, I know it wouldn't be nearly as appealing if I had to call
it Ornithogalum caudatum.
</P>
<P>
   No, pregnant onion works. It is bulging again, pregnant with
several little balls. Pregnant with nature's lessons. With the
beautiful miracle of growth. This is the sweetest onion I know.

 &HT;    Coordinating paint, plant colors makes homes inviting
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a good-looking guy or girl turns your head 180 degrees, you
immediately know why. Those eyes. The smile. That bod. They all
come together to grab your attention.
</P>
<P>
   And when a beautiful house and yard make you do a double take,
chances are the home's architecture, materials and colors are in
sync with its landscaping.
</P>
<P>
   ``So often, people miss the boat on their homes because they
don't understand that if the structure complements the garden, and
vice versa, they've got themselves some major curb appeal,'' said
Kenneth Charbonneau, a color marketing consultant for Benjamin
Moore &AMP; Co. paints. ``For most of us, a home is our biggest
investment, so why wouldn't you want to safeguard that?''
</P>
<P>
   Professional designers know how to coordinate a structure with a
landscape. But most do-it-yourselfers need help learning how the
various components of a facade and yard come together to create
harmony, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's as simple as planting a few flowering annuals
near the entrance with the same color of the front door or
shutters. ``If someone is putting his home up for sale or just
looking for the personal gratification in increasing its curb
appeal, a lot of times seasonal colors can draw the eye to certain
areas, such as the entrance, to make it more inviting,'' said
Phillip Cates of Lifescapes landscaping company in Canton, Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   But more often, creating curb appeal requires a look at the big
picture, starting with your home's architecture.
</P>
<P>
   A Victorian style house might lend itself to an English cottage
garden, with colorful perennials and roses spilling loosely over
fences and beds instead of a manicured lawn and foundation shrubs.
``For a contemporary house with lots of glass, you think of a
California type of landscape, which tends to be simpler in style
with lots of tropical plants, like banana trees and sago palms,''
said Mark Schisler of Legacy Landscapes in Marietta. ``It doesn't
hurt to have your house associated with a villa on the beach.''
</P>
<P>
   A simpler way for integrating the home and garden is to think in
terms of formality.
</P>
<P>
   If the facade is formal, such as Georgian style, with a
symmetrical design _ a centered door balanced by an equal number of
windows _ that feel should be extended to the yard, Cates said.
Boxwoods or other stiff, structured shrubs might flank the doorway,
with a straight walkway extending to the street and plantings on
either side that mirror each other.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, if the facade is informal, such as most ranch
styles, with an asymmetrical design (a door off center and possibly
an odd configuration of windows), what works best is an informal
landscape. A small ornamental tree, such as a Japanese maple with
its red leaves, planted at one side of the entry could draw
attention to the door, while a curving walkway would make for a
casual setting. Less-structured plants, such as ornamental grasses
and trailing vines, also can enhance an informal look.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, the landscaping should be planned as the house is being
designed in order to coordinate the two; typically, though, the
yard ends up being designed around the house, making the options
more limited. But even small touches, such as containers or garden
ornaments of a style appropriate for the architecture, can be
placed near the entrance to help put the house and land in harmony.
</P>
<P>
   An equally important tool is color.
</P>
<P>
   Charbonneau recommends selecting up to four exterior paint
colors for accenting the home's various architectural details.
Think of a house as a man's wardrobe, he said. ``The siding should
be like the man's suit. The trim is like a dress shirt. The punch
of color you put on the front door is the tie _ your own little
social statement _ and the shutters are like your socks, or the
accent color,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, play off those colors with your plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more neutral the house color, the more variety you can do
with plants,'' Schisler said. ``Annuals are always effective.''
</P>
<P>
   To draw attention to the door, paint it a color that's different
from all others on the house and repeat that color in plants beside
the entry. A purple door could be complemented by purple pansies in
fall and winter, for example, and purple petunias in spring and
summer. Yellow shutters work well with yellow lantana in summer,
yellow mums in fall.
</P>
<P>
   If the house contains natural materials, such as stone, slate or
brick, choose plants that have flowers or foliage that will
complement them. ``Natural stone is a joy for us to work with, such
as perennials with crab orchard stone,'' Cates said.
</P>
<P>
   That's why light earth tones, such as gray, beige and cream make
dramatic backdrops for rich green foliage. Darker shades make a
house blend into the landscape, while white makes the structure
stand out. Avoid green, especially medium to dark shades, because
it can clash with the landscaping.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran expert who advises product manufacturers and companies
throughout the country on color, he said one of the worst examples
of curb appeal he's seen was a house in New Jersey painted cottage
red and surrounded by purple-blooming azaleas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like fingernails on a blackboard,'' he said.

 &HT;    Tips for exterior decorating
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- When choosing exterior paint, remember that colors intensify
and look brighter in daylight than they do on the color card in the
store. Buy quarts and test the colors on the outside of the house.
</P>
<P>
   -- Keep in mind that today's color combinations are softer in
contrast, with tones of one color or similar colors. Twenty years
ago, it was light siding and dark trim, or vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   -- Remember that color can be skewed by its surroundings. If a
yellow house is surrounded by a lot of trees in summer, the foliage
will make the house appear a yellow-green.
</P>
<P>
   -- Look for architectural details that can be accented with a
paint color different from the rest of the house. One popular
accent color is teal, which works well with flowers that are pink
and white, purple and violet, yellow and white or orange and gold.
</P>
<P>
   -- When coordinating plants with exterior colors, don't overlook
the roof, because shingles aren't something you replace very often.
Play off a red roof with red-blooming annuals or trees with red
foliage.
</P>
<P>
   -- Be kind to your neighbors. Choose colors that will increase
your curb appeal but avoid ones that will make your house scream
above others on your block.

 &HT;    After 20 years as pope, John Paul II remains bigger than life
 &HT;    By Charles W. Holmes
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vatican City_History occasionally hands the world a leader who
so seamlessly fits the job and his times that it is difficult to
imagine anyone else in the role.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II on Friday marked 20 years at the head of the
billion-strong Roman Catholic Church, a job he has redefined with
tenacious energy and unprecedented globetrotting during two
momentous decades.
</P>
<P>
   Now at 78, he is fragile and fading. Yet he continues to enliven
his church while staunchly defending its traditional _ and to some,
controversial _ doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The step is slower,'' said Archbishop John Foley, a Vatican
spokesman, ``but the will is still there.''
</P>
<P>
   In his prime, John Paul II helped hasten the collapse of
Communism and the end of the Cold War. He has more than any pope
before him taken steps to reconcile Christianity and Judaism,
issuing a formal apology recently for the Catholic church's silence
during the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning a third decade at the Vatican, his reign is longer
than any other pope this century. His mind remains strong, even if
he must fight his ailing body. In 1999, he plans trips to Mexico,
the United States (St. Louis) and to his native Poland.
</P>
<P>
   As pope, John Paul II has traveled 670,878 miles to 117
countries to deliver his message to many millions in person,
billions on television _ making him among the most recognizable
figures on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   He has been called by a recent biographer ``the last of the
giants on the global stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Ceremonies at the Vatican and in Poland observed the papal
anniversary Friday. On Sunday, a special high Mass will be
celebrated in St. Peter's Square.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II, despite his sometimes visible pain and slurred
speech _ reportedly the result of Parkinson's disease, though the
Vatican has never confirmed it _ is looking beyond Friday's
milestone to the approaching millennium.
</P>
<P>
   He pledges to be present for the Holy Year 2000 Jubilee, being
planned as a celebration of the church's history and a
reaffirmation of its dogma. On Thursday, he released his 13th papal
encyclical, a 154-page intellectual and theological letter to the
faithful reminding them not to lose their way ``in the shifting
sands of widespread skepticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the pope's health has led to speculation inside the
Vatican and out about his possible successor and the future course
of Catholic theology.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be a tough act to follow,'' said Monsignor Timothy
Dolan, rector of the Pontifical North American College of Rome, a
seminary near the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be difficult to think of the papacy as returning to
the former model of leadership _ just the CEO of the church. It is
that, of course, but he has shifted it to a new paradigm _ to a
dimension as a world leader, a towering moral figure and a
universal pastor. He will be the model for future popes,'' Dolan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the enigmatic internal politics of the Vatican, the
numbers suggest that the pope's legacy will continue after his
death. All but 14 of the 115 cardinals eligible to elect a new
pontiff were appointed by John Paul II. More than half of the
church's 4,200 bishops advanced during this pope's reign.
</P>
<P>
   Karol Wojtyla, the multilingual, 58-year-old archbishop of
Krakow, was the first non-Italian pope in 455 years and the first
Polish pope ever, elected as change was beginning to sweep
throughout his homeland and the rest of Communist-ruled Eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Still wearing the starched vestments and robes of the papacy, he
made the job of pope a sometimes gritty business.
</P>
<P>
   Living through the ravages of Nazi- and Soviet-era rule in
Poland, he put his personal stamp on the Solidarity movement in
Poland and threw the full moral weight of the church behind the
relatively bloodless revolution throughout Eastern Europe. He
traveled to Nicaragua in 1983 and stared down the Marxist
Sandinistas over their human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   In traveling the world, he brought a common touch and a finesse
of the cameras as no other 20th century pope before him. He
survived an assassination attempt in 1981, but continued his
frequent travel, albeit behind bulletproof glass and tighter
security.
</P>
<P>
   In the age of television and the World Wide Web, he humanized
what for centuries was a unapproachable, authoritarian job.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all his modernity, he has remained a staunch
traditionalist defending controversial church doctrine and
resisting change _ opposing birth control, abortion, a role for
women in the priesthood, suggestions that priests should be
permitted to marry.
</P>
<P>
   Liberals within the church have branded him as a dinosaur who is
alienating segments of society by failing to face the realities of
the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps if he had been more flexible on these issues the
popularity of the church would have increased in Europe and
America. But he stood firm with the understanding that one cannot
be pope and be swayed by opinion polls,'' said Domenico del Rio, a
veteran Vatican correspondent for the Italian daily La Stampa.
</P>
<P>
   His charisma and intellectual appeal have allowed him to
maintain his authoritarian convictions without deep schisms
resulting in the church, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Vatican aides say he wishes to go three places that politics and
diplomacy have denied him: Russia, China and the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   And his main aim in his waning years is to cut through the
confusion of a changing global economy and spiritual indifference
with his post-Cold War message of humanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be a capitalism with a conscience,'' said the
Vatican spokesman, Foley, ``working for social responsibility and
not just the survival of the fittest.''

`BRIDE OF CHUCKY': CARRYING A TORCH FOR A MALEVOLENT DOLL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: production notes are at end of review) 
(bl) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A handful of jokes about Martha Stewart, a dig at Barbie and an
excursion into the sex life of toys cannot rescue the comic Grand
Guignol that is ``Bride of Chucky'' from the graveyard of horror
sequels that lose the heartbeat of inspiration long before they die
of box office anemia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bride of Chucky,'' directed this time by Ronny Yu, splatters
blood, piles up corpses and puts two star-crossed young lovers in
peril before it reaches the inevitable conclusion (in a Hackensack,
N.J. graveyard) that suggests that the family of Chucky films that
began in 1988 with ``Child's Play'' is prepared to grow yet again.
</P>
<P>
   But the novelty of a bloody horror film built around a
malevolent doll carrying the soul of a serial killer has worn thin.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth of these films written by Don Mancini, Jennifer
Tilly manages to provide signs of a pulse for a few minutes at the
outset in the role of Tiffany. She is a tarty, bottle-blond
specimen of trailer-park trash who for a decade has been carrying a
misguided torch for the serial killer, Charles Lee Ray.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that Ray died leaving behind an expensive diamond ring
that Tiffany inferred was intended as a token of his love for her.
Romantic fool that she is, Tiffany bribes a police officer to sneak
into the Lockport Police Evidence Depository one dark and stormy
night and remove a plastic bag containing the remains of Chucky.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the trailer after disposing of the policeman, the
mini-skirted Tiffany stitches up the demolished doll, gets out her
copy of ``Voodoo for Dummies'' and restores Chucky to life, only to
learn that he never intended to marry her. So she locks him into a
cradle with a lid and angrily tosses in a doll dressed as a bride
to keep him company.
</P>
<P>
   While Tiffany is sipping white wine in a bubble bath and
watching Elsa Lanchester and Boris Karloff plight their troth in
James Whale's infinitely better ``Bride of Frankenstein'' (1935),
Chucky is busy sawing his way out of his prison with the aid of the

   And when he attacks Tiffany, and the television set falls into

At this point, ``Bride of Chucky'' runs out of figurative gas,

This 1st TAKE OF THE SEX-OFFENDERS STORY HAS BEEN RE-SENT TO &HT;    EDITORS: The names in this story have been changed. 
 
By R.A. DYER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Ryan Conner was 9 years old, an insecure kid with dyslexia, when
a teacher offered him the most powerful words in the English
language: I love you.
</P>
<P>
   Then he reached for the boy's crotch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `Stop, it's nasty,' '' recalled the boy. ``Mr. O
said, `Oh, come on' and just kept doing it. I just thought he is an
older person, and I have to do what he says.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan was sexually assaulted by 59-year-old Richard O'Leary over
the course of several months in 1989 and 1990. Eventually, the
teacher confessed to the crime and was given a 10-year probationary
sentence. As part of that, O'Leary underwent years of therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, Ryan Conner remains horribly scarred: He
believes the assaults affected his views on sex, women and
authority figures. And he says that justice has not been done, that
O'Leary deserved long imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, O'Leary expresses tortured remorse for his
crimes, but says counseling has taught him self-control. He says
his punishment was correct. Never again, O'Leary insists, will he
harm another child.
</P>
<P>
   This crime, and tens of thousands like it, raise tough,
emotional questions. Should neighbors be alerted when a sex
offender moves next door? Should offenders be kept in jail for as
long as possible? Is the answer therapy, as O'Leary believes?
</P>
<P>
   The story of Conner and O'Leary _ the story of one crime, but
two damaged people _ can provide a human reference point for those
who consider such questions. For any answer carries a human toll:
for the public, for the abused, even for the offender.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1986, O'Leary began work at one of Houston's more
popular private elementary schools, where he taught science,
history and physical education. It was there _ during the early
part of the 1989 school year, probably during a climbing-wall class
_ that he met and became fixated on Conner.
</P>
<P>
   On the evening of March 12, 1991, about a year after O'Leary
left the school, three patrol officers came to his door, read him
his rights and led him away in handcuffs. He was panicked and
sobbing. The charges: two counts of aggravated sexual assault of a
minor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked, scared, crying, humiliated,'' O'Leary recalled.
``I don't know, I was just so afraid. But there was also this sense
of relief, like this is going to trigger an end to all this, one
way or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   After his arrest, O'Leary confessed to assaulting Conner, to
similarly abusing another boy years earlier and to acting
inappropriately with 11 other children since puberty. But the
statute of limitations had expired on these other acts, so O'Leary
was prosecuted only in Conner's case.
</P>
<P>
   The strictest sex offender registration and notification laws
would not have prevented these assaults, and O'Leary may never have
been arrested if Conner had not alerted his mother. The admission
came Feb. 25, 1991, a year after the assaults ended, in his
mother's car, as she drove Conner home from his therapist's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that he didn't want to tell me since I would probably
cry,'' recalled his mother. ``(Conner) had numerous nightmares that
night, waking me about every 15 to 30 minutes to tell me that he
was dreaming that Mr. (O'Leary) was going to kill him.''
</P>
<P>
   Through therapy, O'Leary says he has gained a better
understanding of his sexual compulsions. He described some of those
conclusions, and much of his life story, during hours of interviews
at his home in one of Houston's upscale enclave cities.
</P>
<P>
   Through most of it, O'Leary sat in an easy chair, his legs
crossed at the ankles. He generally spoke in soft, even tones _
except on a few occasions when he wept, or on another occasion,
when his voice rose perceptibly after acknowledging a contradiction
in his account.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary is thin, but not too tall, and walks with a shuffling
grace. With his graying hair, long face and soft voice, he reminds
one of television's Mr. Rogers. He speaks easily, rarely fumbling
with words, even at awkward moments.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary graduated from Rice University in Houston in 1953 with a
degree in philosophy and later received a theology degree from New
York's Union Theological Seminary, one of the country's best. He is
an ordained minister and worked as a minister and youth director at
two Methodist churches for the first 15 years of his career. Later,
he worked at various private schools in the Houston area.
</P>
<P>
   He is married and has four adult children (none say they were
ever victimized by their father) and six grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary said he agreed to tell his story to show that he and
others like him are not necessarily monsters.
</P>
<P>
   He can look a person in the eye, and without turning away, say,
``I'm a child molester.'' What may be even more difficult for
people to hear is this: Richard O'Leary also says he's a human
being.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my mother and father met and married, my father had just
gotten out of World War I,'' O'Leary began, choosing his words
carefully. ``But he told her he had a serious war injury and that
they could not have any sexual contact until the injury was
corrected.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary's father, however, had lied. There was no war injury.
Instead, he had syphilis, presumably contracted overseas. Although
O'Leary's mother did not divorce her husband, she nonetheless was
repulsed by him. And O'Leary's father, who eventually was cured of
syphilis, remained sexually frustrated throughout the marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so that was the home I was born into,'' said O'Leary,
recounting a story told to him by his mother shortly before her
death. ``I remember violent fights, a cold aloof woman _ repulsed
by her husband _ and those terrifying fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember going to bed at night and hearing them fight
and hearing her wail and cry and remembering hearing that he was
throwing stuff across the room _ probably at her. We were
terrified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, my father's anger and frustration would focus on my
brother and I. We got whipped by his hand, by his belt, and we got
kicked. I remember getting kicked _ that was probably the worst
punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary also said his mother could not console him _ ``There
were never any hugs and kisses'' _ and that the only love he
received was from his brother, Raymond. About a year his senior,
Raymond also was terrified by their father's frightful rages.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there was this one time I felt my father loved me,'' said
O'Leary.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was about 5 years old, playfully wrestling with his
father. But as they rolled around on the bed _ laughing happily _
the play turned sexual, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a clue what was going on,'' said O'Leary. ``I
couldn't compare his behavior with any other sexual behavior,
because I didn't have any other sexual behavior to compare it with.
I didn't think it was abnormal behavior, because I didn't know what
normal was.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in my mind, I linked a man playing with a little boy _
being sexual with a little boy _ with a man loving a little boy. It
was so much better than being kicked and demeaned and whipped and
beaten with a belt. I thought my dad was loving me.''
</P>
<P>
   After that single incident _ for O'Leary recalled no other
sexual encounter with his father _ he began to ``act out sexually''
with his brother. As the family couldn't afford a big house, the
two brothers slept in the same room, in the same bed. That's where
it happened, night after night, for about five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I loved my brother, and that's the way you show
love: sexually,'' said O'Leary. ``I never forgot those sexual
experiences I had with my father and my brother. But somehow or the
other, I didn't link that with pedophile tendencies. It's odd in
retrospect.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Conner doesn't buy it. O'Leary's whole story about the
brother _ the one who witnessed this abuse first-hand, the one with
whom O'Leary supposedly engaged in incest for five years _ where is
he now? Conveniently dead. O'Leary's older brother can neither
confirm nor dispute the story because he was killed in a hunting
accident about 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And what does O'Leary's other brother _ a younger sibling still
living in Texas _ have to say? In a sworn affidavit, he says he
knows nothing of O'Leary's early childhood because he was born
seven years after his brother.
</P>
<P>
   To Conner, O'Leary is an intelligent and well-spoken con man.
How else to explain the high regard to which he was held by parents
and teachers? How else to explain the probationary sentence? And,
especially, how else to explain O'Leary's popularity with all the
little boys at the school, the boys who idolized O'Leary?
</P>
<P>
   To them, said Conner, Mr. O'Leary was like a god.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. O in that school was the man,'' he said. ``He always did
stuff that boys liked, like he would make explosions happen and he
showed us how to climb rocks. But (he wasn't popular) with the
girls so much, because the girls didn't care about seeing something
explode on the table when you mixed two chemicals together.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would even bad-mouth the girls, in front of the guys. He
would try to make himself seem like one of the guys and would try
to keep the girls away, saying this was a `guys only' lesson. Or
he'd say, `We're going to be blowing things up here, and you can't
be around.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Conner is grown now: 18 years old, ruddy good looks, thin but
athletic. He works outdoors as a boat mechanic and so has grease
beneath his nails and hair that has gone blonde from the sun. For a
youth with so many problems _ he said that he hardly left his house
for years after the sexual assaults _ Conner speaks with
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The dyslexia that keeps him from writing clearly has not
prevented him from gaining a command of language. He can succinctly
describe his violent attacks on a classmate, or punching his fist
through a window pane, or becoming sick with anxiety upon being
called to testify against O'Leary.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks of it all with lively twang, with drawn-out Texas
vowels and ``yeps'' and ``uh huhs,'' and with a bit of profanity
here and there.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one elementary school, I remember that I had a female
teacher that tried to make me do my work, and so I'd pick up
furniture _ you know, the little chairs _ and I'd throw them around
the room,'' he said, recalling the months after the assaults. ``And
at recess, if anybody tried to do anything to me, like try to take
the ball away from me, I'd end up pounding their face into the
ground.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this

WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: PATIENTS
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Oct. 9, the Senate voted to block the ``Patients'
Bill of Rights.'' By a 50-47 vote, senators decided to table -- or
set aside for the year -- the legislation which would give patients
more rights when dealing with managed-care companies. Supporters of
the motion said the bill had become too politicized and disagreed
with the provision that would allow patients to sue their health
plans. Proponents of the patients' rights bill said it was an
important issue and the Republicans were being unfair by denying
them a chance to debate the bill. A ``yes'' vote favors setting the
bill aside for the year.
</P>
<P>
   VOTE : 1

</P>
<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: BANKRUPTCY
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Oct. 9, the House approved, 300-125, a measure that
would revise bankruptcy laws to make it harder for individuals to
become debt-free by declaring bankruptcy. Supporters, who were
strongly backed by credit card companies, said too many people were
given a ``free ride'' by taking advantage of the current bankruptcy
laws. Opponents said the bill favored special interests, like
credit card companies, and would hurt people in dire straits,
including the elderly and hard-working families. A ``yes'' vote
favors the bill.

``BAYWATCH'' MEETS ``BONANZA'' IN HAWAII
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Wind on Water''
</P>
<P>
   Starring: Bo Derek, Lee Horsley, William Gregory Lee, Brian
Gross, Jacinda Barrett, Shawn Christian &QL; 
On: NBC, Ch. 7 &QL; 
Time: Saturday at 8 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `Wind on Water,'' a series premiering Saturday on NBC is set on
a very picturesque Hawaii, where the waves are totally tubular and
the babes _ male and female _ are totally toned. There's lots and
lots of water around Hawaii, of course, which means there's lots
and lots of swimming and surfing, which means there's lots and lots
of bathing suits, which means there's lots and lots of flesh, which
of course is the raison d'etre for the show. Let's hope no one at
the network had high hopes regarding the dramatic elements of this
hybrid of ``Baywatch'' and ``Bonanza,'' which ranges from the
merely cliched to the obvious, the turgid, and the silly.
</P>
<P>
   The show follows the fortunes of the Connolly family, as their
very evil and wealthy neighbor tries to buy out their cattle range
to turn it into a resort. The Connolly sons, Cole and Kelly, happen
to be world-class surfers, and they just might be able to save the
day in an important competition that might (I don't want to give
anything away) require Cole to ride the biggest wave ever ridden.
The Connolly matriarch is played by Bo Derek, the actress who is
best known for being 10 on a scale of 10, although the top rating
is certainly not for her acting. To be fair, Derek is doomed by the
script, which requires her all-knowing earth-mother character to
deliver gems like ``Follow your dreams where they take you.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bad guy on ``Wind on Water'' is played with 100 percent
nefariousness by Lee Horsley, who was TV's ``Matt Houston'' in the
1980s. The show's curiosity factor is slightly upped by the fact
that his daughter, who is smitten with the Connolly boys in a
little ``Romeo and Juliet'' twist, is played by a former cast
member of MTV's ``The Real World'' named Jacinda Barrett. That's
not much of a leap, though, since this great-looking, vapid hour
isn't too far a cry from those endless MTV beach parties.

TOYOTA MAKES AN ENTRY INTO THE TOUGH TRUCK CATEGORY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Toyota, dropping the kid gloves in the truck market, unveiled a
new weapon for a fresh assault on full-size pickup market share for
the New England Motor Press Association this week. The truck,
dubbed Tundra, is to be a no-nonsense competitor with a
245-horsepower (315 ft/lb torque), 32-valve, double overhead cam
low-emissions V-8 under the hood, a one-ton load capacity, and the
ability to tow 7,200 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   And, while maybe it won't qualify as an all-American vehicle, it
is to be assembled in a new factory near Princeton, Ind. Tundra,
Toyota said, is to be available in rear-drive or four-wheel-drive
with either a regular two-door cab with an eight-foot bed or the
four-door Access version with a 6.5-foot bed. Toyota said the
Tundras would also come with dual 12-volt outlets and achieve
something of a breakthrough in cupholders for pickups.
</P>
<P>
   The Tundra came as the capstone of an automotive history lecture
by Toyota's Wade Hoyt, who detailed the birth and growth of the
mini-truck phenomenon in America.

<P>
   The New England International Auto Show blows into town two
weeks from today for a nine-day stay at Bayside Exposition Center.
While it has not achieved the size and stature of the Detroit and
New York shows just yet, it has become a major event for the motor
industry where new models debut and are hailed with full-blown
press conferences. And it is the first of the major shows.
</P>
<P>
   What began as an Auto Show/New England Motor Press Association
lunch is now Press Preview Day with major unveilings scheduled
Friday, Oct. 30, the day before the show opens to the public. This
year, the keynote speaker is Mark Hutchins, president of Lincoln
Mercury and a vice president of Ford Motor Co. New models to be
seen for the first time in Boston are the 1999 Acura 3.5 RL, the
Saab 9-5 wagon, Saturn's new 3-door coupe, the Mercedes-Benz C230
Kompressor, and the BMW 5 Series Sport Wagon.
</P>
<P>
   The show promises to be of more than casual interest to car
buyers and car buffs _ in addition to new models, exotics and
concept vehicles, a new marque debuts: Korea's Kia will have its
line on view.
</P>
<P>
   Show hours are 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Sundays, 2 p.m. to 9 p.m. Monday and Tuesday, 2 p.m. to 10 p.m.
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Admission is $8 for adults, $4 for
children 6-12, free to children under 6. Discount coupons are
available at car dealers and in the Tuesday, Nov. 5, edition of The
Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   The show is sponsored by the Massachusetts State Automobile
Dealers Association and The Globe _ which means that your humble
scribe will be on hand at the Globe booth most show days for a
couple of hours to answer questions and take comments.

   In the course of recent travels, rain has been a plague. It
started with the annual International Motor Press Association Test
Day at Pocono Raceway in the hills of eastern Pennsylvania, an
event in which auto and truck manufacturers bring their wares to
the track where members of the press (and a whole lot of other
people, it seems) drive their wares on a course, including a
section of the high-speed raceway and a paved infield roadway, to
sense the handling.
</P>
<P>
   Off-road-capable vehicles have a separate course through unpaved
sections _ but not this year. In the rain, the first thing to go is
the off-road course, despite the fact these vehicles are designed
for just such work. No, the manufacturers are not leery of getting
mud on the new machines _ they risk more than that just handing
over all those keys. It is the guardians of the track facility who
frown on tearing up the grass.
</P>
<P>
   The turnout was light this year, it seemed, most likely because
of the widespread knowledge that Pocono is undergoing major
construction _ the kitchen and lunchroom were gone and the sanitary
facilities had been replaced for the moment with those portable
things. Not pretty. Yet with all the hardships, the lunch was
spectacular compared to previous years.
</P>
<P>
   The rain dampened the track and the speeds for most drivers.
Before the downpour got too extreme, I did manage to compare an
Audi A4 and an Audi A6 _ these cars look alike but there are small
but significant differences, aside from price and power. The A4 is
a nimble little car that, with a Quattro option, takes on just
about any road in any weather, but its back seat is cramped and it
still has that idiotic stalk serving as a headlight switch. With
that stalk sitting, as it does, atop the signal stalk, it's a
simple matter to make a really bad move at night and find yourself
in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   The A6 has more room in the rear _ the A6 Avant wagon is the
superior version, I believe _ and the stalk has given way to a real
headlight switch. Both cars still feature red dash illumination, a
drawback for the color-perception challenged, but that will change
next year in the A6 at least. With the all-wheel-drive Quattro
option, a rain-slicked roadway proved no hazard in an Avant.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in many a moon, I got behind the wheel of a
GMC truck, the new model for 1999, and found it a pleasant beast,
roomy, powerful, very manageable on the track in the rain despite
the speedsters who insist everybody drive like Buck Rogers. General
Motors has been at war with the motor press and makes it extremely
difficult for some to sample their cars, impossible for others.
</P>
<P>
   The rain increased in ferocity, slowing things considerably, but
some of us began to fret about the exuberance being displayed by a
few _ but it was a professional driver for Porsche, not a member of
the press or an automotive wannabe who signaled an end to the
misery by spinning a new Porsche into the wall. Injuries were a
bruise to the passenger's arm and severe damage to the driver's
ego.
</P>
<P>
   The consolations of the soggy day were to be found in
conversation with colleagues and an early start to supper at Arlene
&AMP; Tom's in Port Jervis, N.Y., but that doesn't mean much when
you're paid to drive.

THIRD-QUARTER PROFITS DOWN 12.7 PERCENT AT CATERPILLAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Caterpillar Inc., the world's largest manufacturer of
construction and earth-moving equipment, said Friday that
third-quarter profits fell 12.7 percent because of weaker sales in
Asia and greater competitive pressures that forced the company to
lower prices around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The results, which were well below Wall Street's expectations,
helped deepen the gloom surrounding Caterpillar and other companies
that continue to suffer from a global economic crisis that is
slowing worldwide demand for farm and earth-moving equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Caterpillar, which is based in Peoria, Ill., fell $1,
or 2.1 percent, to $47 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly looks like the competitive landscape has gotten
worse,'' said David Bleustein, an analyst at Paine Webber. ``There
is much more pricing pressure than there was three months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Caterpillar said, however, that revenue growth was strong, with
sales of $5.17 billion in the third quarter, up 12.5 percent from a
year ago, largely because of rising sales spurred by lower prices,
huge discounts and strong demand for its equipment in the United
States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Profits for the quarter were $336 million, down from $385
million a year ago. That translated into 92 cents a diluted share,
down 9 percent from $1.01 a share a year ago. Wall Street analysts
had forecast earnings of $1 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Slowing demand for farm and construction equipment in Asia and
Latin America and Caterpillar's acquisition of Perkins Engines in
February cut into profits. Caterpillar was also hurt by its foreign
currency exposure, because of the strong dollar, and by a heavier
sales mix of equipment that had lower profit margins.

RIO GRANDE VALLEY LAND DEBATE ERUPTS OVER EFFORT TO PRESERVE
ENDANGERED WILDCAT SPECIES 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 18) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ISABEL, Texas _ Trying to help an endangered wildcat make a
comeback while preserving a delicate ecosystem of sand dunes, tidal
flats and grassy marshes, the federal government is offering to buy
a large amount of land in the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan to expand the Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife
refuge by 172,000 acres _ including the upper half of South Padre
Island near the southern tip of Texas _ is being fought by area
cities that want to leave open the chance for future resort
development, and by communities fearing curtailed beach access.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Givens, who lives near the existing refuge, warns that
when added to the Padre Island National Seashore to the north and
holdings along the Rio Grande to the south, the refuge expansion
would place long stretches of the Texas coast and borderlands in
government hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest concern is this is part of a huge land grab in
South Texas, and the federal government is hiding from the people
of Texas what they are doing,'' said Givens, a retired Army colonel
living in Los Fresnos.
</P>
<P>
   The cities of South Padre Island, Bayview and Los Fresnos have
also voiced their opposition to the refuge expansion, and they are
gaining support from beachgoers who for decades have enjoyed free,
unfettered access to Valley beaches for surf fishing, shell
hunting, picnicking _ even nude sunbathing.
</P>
<P>
   Bayview Mayor Bob Middleton said his main concern is that if the
federal government owns the land, it could eventually restrict
fishing in the area. ``That's just too much land for them to be
tying up forever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Austin, a longtime fishing guide, agrees something needs to
be done to preserve the Valley's pristine beaches but also is
concerned about beach access.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see it (expanded), but then again I know what's
going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will lose the right to use it. There is no doubt in my
mind the federal government is going to curtail traditional uses as
we know it.''
</P>
<P>
   But refuge manager Steve Labuda promises that access will
continue under the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's
multimillion-dollar plan to buy or lease land and more than
quadruple the refuge's acreage.
</P>
<P>
   The existing refuge, 47,000 acres across the Laguna Madre Bay
from South Padre Island, serves as an important wintering stop for
migratory birds that draw thousands of eco-tourists to the Valley
every year.
</P>
<P>
   The new acreage would provide additional habitat for a number of
endangered species, including 30 to 35 ocelots _ the country's
largest remaining wild population of the reclusive wildcat, which
makes its home in the brushy thickets of the refuge. Federal
biologists hope the small ocelot population, which is showing signs
of inbreeding, would be able to migrate off the refuge and into an
adjacent wildlife corridor that the government is slowly stringing
together along the banks of the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, this plan will allow them to expand southward and
all up and down the river as far as Laredo, if they want, to find
other ocelots,'' Labuda said.
</P>
<P>
   Labuda, a native Texan, biologist and avid hunter and fisherman,
understands residents' concerns, but he is hopeful he can gain
their trust.
</P>
<P>
   He notes that, as it has done in the past, the federal
government will only buy or lease land from willing sellers, and it
will compensate the surrounding counties for lost property taxes.
(This year, the wildlife service gave Cameron County $139,900 to
make up for lost taxes on existing lands in the refuge, and future
payments could reach $400,000 a year.)
</P>
<P>
   Labuda also points out that no tax dollars will be used to
purchase or lease land. Instead, Fish and Wildlife will tap
proceeds from federal duck stamps as well as revenue from offshore
oil leases and from grazing and timber harvesting on public lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect people to necessarily take me at my word when I
tell them they're going to have free access to the beaches,
improved hunting, more access to (government) lands in the Valley
as a result of this program,'' Labuda said. ``But I hope to prove
(it) to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the wildlife agency's goal to expand the refuge has
been hindered by a 57-page draft issued in August, which in part
seems to contradict promises made by Labuda and local refuge
officials. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Opponents of the expansion, including Givens, are using the
flawed document to claim government officials will promise Valley
residents one thing, and do another. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``I think in the future, some starry-eyed beauty from New York
City, who doesn't appreciate hunting and fishing, could be assigned
to manage the refuge and she could use the stuff in this document
to deny fishing on the lower Laguna Madre,'' Givens said. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Meanwhile, Valley farmers say there is concern that an expanded
refuge _ inhabited by growing numbers Aplomado falcons, ocelots and
other endangered species _ could lead to restrictions on certain
pesticides and agricultural chemicals, curtailing ability to raise
certain crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big fear that agriculture has is they'll get 20,000 or
30,000 (more) acres in the county, and they'll declare a five-mile
buffer zone around that and then list the chemicals you can't
use,'' said one Valley farmer. ``If they do that, they've
effectively taken your land without paying for it.''
</P>
<P>
   When endangered Aplomado falcons were released on the refuge in
1985, farmers and conservationists met with federal biologists and
reached a deal on the use of pesticides and other chemicals near
the refuge. The compromise allowed farming next to the refuge while
protecting the small falcon, which vanished from Texas in the 1940s
because of habitat loss and pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agricultural community in Texas needs to have some sort of
program that says we will not be inhibited from doing what is legal
on our land just because wildlife habitat has moved next door to
us,'' said Wayne Halbert, manager of a Harlingen irrigation
district who worked on the falcon compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more ocelots killed on highways than anywhere else,
and farmers should not be at risk of being fined or put in jail for
using a licensed pesticide in a legal manner, any more than a
motorist is at risk for running over an ocelot that runs out in
front of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Labuda acknowledged that part of the uproar over the expansion
plan is that the first draft was misleading and ``not real
well-written.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to correct any errors in the next draft, expected by
year end, to ease residents' concerns. He said if he succeeds in
acquiring the land, he will seek to keep it open for the same
public uses as today.
</P>
<P>
   Local suspicions about beach closure were heightened last summer
when the state highway department barricaded the only paved road
leading beyond the town of South Padre Island, preventing cars from
driving on the beach through a number of breaks in sand dunes.
Instead, visitors had little choice but to pay to drive onto the
beach through two toll booths on county-owned land.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government, however, plans no fees to drive on the
northern part of the island, Labuda said. He added that many Valley
families could not afford a $2 entrance fee to get to the beach and
hopes to improve access so more people can enjoy the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the opposition, the expansion has some ardent
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make those arrangements so we will have at least
one part of the world, or South Texas, that still is in its natural
state, wildlife in its natural habitat,'' said Ralph Cowan, a
Brownsville car dealer. &QL;

   MIDEAST-ECON-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ The Israeli business community
and foreign investors have a deep interest in seeing a genuine
Israeli-Palestinian accord. While the political arguments have

pre-election polls. By Michael R. Kagay.
</P>
<P>
   HATE-CRIMES-REVIEW (Houston) _ Laws against hate crimes raise a
paradox: such laws are designed to magnify an offense and show our
condemnation of it, but in extreme cases such as murder, these laws
may be unnecessary, since the person convicted would probably get
the maximum punishment anyway. By Rick Lyman.
</P>
<P>
   BAD-SAMARITANS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The case of David Cash, who
witnessed a fatal attack on a child but did nothing to intervene or

   JAPAN-U.S.-BANKS-REVIEW (Washington) _ There are striking
parallels between the United States in the late 1980s as it

it faces a banking system near collapse. Those similarities offer
lessons about what and what not to do. By Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   SACRILEGIOUS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The play ``Corpus Christi'' has
refueled debate over a purported double standard: is offending
Christians not as bad as offending other religious or ethnic
groups? But the deeper and more complicated issue is what is fair
and what goes over the line in dealing with religious themes. By

 ,  64, is identified with wide-ranging work on poverty. There was
plenty of schadenfreude as well. The forced sale of Long-Term
Capital Management, the immense hedge fund for the very rich and
powerful that had been built upon the application of Merton and
Scholes' latest formulas, seems to have cost the laureates' their
considerable personal fortunes. (They were among its partners.)
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yet a look at the pattern of the prizes of the last four years
shows that the Swedish Academy of Sciences, which makes the award,
has put a great deal of effort into saying something about the
state of modern economics that is interesting, encouraging, and, to
many, persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   I say four years because it was five years ago that Assar
Lindbeck, leader of an older generation among Swedish economists,
retired from the committee that prepares the recommendations for
the prize. He had served as its leader since it began. He was no
stick-in-the-mud; far from it. But he took others with him, and
with their departure leadership passed to the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, the economics Nobel is a recent invention. Its proper
name is the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of
Alfred Nobel. The idea was to commemorate the 300th anniversary of
the founding of Sweden's central bank.
</P>
<P>
   The prize was first awarded in 1969, its reception greatly eased
by the long economic boom of the 1950s and 1960s and the sense that
a breakthrough of some sort finally had been achieved by the dismal
science. It joined the five original prizes stipulated in 1895 by
the will of the explosives magnate _ in physics, chemistry,
medicine or physiology, literature, and peace.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the reputation of economics among the general public
has gone mostly downhill. But the Nobel committee was charged with
taking the long view, and for 25 years it carefully charted the
pattern by which economics became its modern self. Within the
profession the committee achieved great authority, working off its
backlog &UR;  &LR; of worthy winners, producing mostly hits and only a few
wheezes in the most political of sciences.
</P>
<P>
   With the general public, too, it maintained credibility,
favoring neither left nor right. In 1974 it split the difference,
dividing the prize equally between Gunnar Myrdal and Friedrich
Hayek.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1980s, however, the committee was caught up in the
ideological battles of the decade, unable to agree about where the
spotlight should be turned. Economics felt itself to have been
progressing rapidly, yet in 1988 and 1989, prizes went for work
done in 1944. Lags between the work itself and its citation in
Stockholm were averaging 40 years _ as opposed to 10 or 12 in
chemistry and biology as and less in physics.
</P>
<P>
   Then Lindbeck stepped down, the composition of the committee
changed, and whammo! Robert Lucas of the University of Chicago was
cited in 1995. Nobody represented better than Lucas the
discontinuous nature of the change that occurred in economics
during the 1970s. With his 1972 paper on the non-neutrality of
money, he had used high-tech math to bring into sharper focus the
role of individuals' expectations in economic life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, James Mirrlees and William Vickrey were honored. The
fact that they shared the citation seemed to cast the new message
into even sharper relief. Vickery, born in 1914, was an old
fashioned verbal economist, quite brilliant in his day, which
spanned from World War II to the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Mirrlees, on the other hand, born in 1936, was a mathematical
economist whose 1971 article on optimal nonlinear income taxation
was all but indecipherable to those outside the field. And yet
their contributions to the theory of information and incentives
were pretty much the same.
</P>
<P>
   See? the Swedes seemed to be saying: the new high-tech methods
do the same as the old and do it better; they are less ambiguous
and more easily understood and tested. Mirrlees' influence among
his peers was enormous, while Vickrey had been all but forgotten by
the young. As if to underscrore the point, Vickrey died of a heart
attack three days after the award was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the 1997 award to Merton and Scholes. (A third
contributor, Fischer Black, had died the year before.) The
revolutionary Black-Scholes options pricing formula had been
introduced in 1972, generalized by Merton, and shortly therefter
programmed into hand-held calculators used by traders around the
world. It was perhaps the most dominating demonstration of the
practical significance of economic theory ever achieved.
</P>
<P>
   The Nobel committee had clearly moved the frontier of
prize-quality work into the era of the Vietnam War. And in this
respect, this year's award to Sen is no exception: ``Collective
Choice and Social Welfare,'' the first of Sen's three books cited
by the committee, was published in 1970. ``On Economic Inequality''
followed in 1973 and ``Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement
and Deprivation'' in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   In another respect, too, Sen's award is similiar to the others.
His work on the theory of ``social choice,'' on which the citation
dwelt at length, is highly technical. An abstract, almost
philosophical field dealing with collective decision-making, social
choice begins with the propounding of axioms, propositions taken to
be true whose relevance is nevertheless hard to pin down.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the other bodies of work, Sen's writings lack the
single drop-dead insight that changes the way a particular problem
is perceived and galvanizes other researchers to work variations on
the theme. Instead, his contributions to social choice are
persistently critical.
</P>
<P>
   They point to difficulties of the ``impossibility'' theorem that
is at the core of social choice: how can satisfactory collective
decision-making be impossible when it happens every day? Sen's
writings therefore raise doubts about the significance of the very
activity of which they are a part. Very clever the insights are,
very provocative too _ but they are not the kind of theory-and-tool
building exercises &UR;  &LR; that won the prize in the three previous years.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Sen's Nobel Prize is being described by many senior
economists as a kind of a ``person'' prize, a lifetime achievement
award instead of a matter of depersonalized science. And so it is.
</P>
<P>
   But what a career! Forty years of calling attention to the
plight of the most impoverished members of society in an
astonishing variety of ways, from high philosophy to measurement
economics to pointed empirical work. Sen's work on famines is well
known _ they are man-made events, he has shown, not vicissitudes of
the weather, and they never, ever happen in democracies, where
those who are starving have a political voice. But perhaps the
single most striking result he ever obtained was the case of the
missing women.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of simple calculations relying on research by
others, Sen showed that women generally outnumber men in Europe and
North America. They are hardier and survive better at all ages.
They don't smoke as much and they don't go to war. So even though
around 5 percent more boys are born than girls around the world,
women outnumber men in the industrial democracies.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia and North Africa, however, the situation is reversed.
Even adjusting for lower life expectancies, there were 44 million
``missing women'' in China in 1992 and 37 million in India, of a
total of more than 100 million worldwide _ if the male-female ratio
of Eurpe and America prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Rough treatment all around, Sen found. Worse health care,
less food, little education, fewer property rights, even the custom
of ``hiding'' newborns who are girls. Social inequality outweighted
the natural survival advantages of women in these lands.
</P>
<P>
   It is a perfect example of the Sen style. No wonder every
university wants him. (He taught at Harvard for a decade until
Cambridge University lured him back last spring with the mastership
of its richest college.) His contribution is not so much a tool as
a sensibility. He is a 20th century Jane Austin, richly cultured
himself, whose topic is not the manners of the rich, but the
problems of the poor.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Half a century ago, when a group of uneducated immigrant Jews
scraped together enough money to buy a bankrupt medical and
veterinary school in Waltham, Mass., west of Boston, they named it
Brandeis University and set out to found the Harvard of the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was dismissed by many as pie in the sky. But it was a
propitious moment. The Nazis had been defeated, Israel had been
created, the civil rights era was in its infancy, higher education
was on the brink of explosive growth and American Jews were still
restricted in their access to many institutions.
</P>
<P>
   So when the new university _ named after Louis Brandeis, the
first Jewish justice of the U.S. Supreme Court _ quickly became
home to renowned intellectuals like Leonard Bernstein, Max Lerner
and Herbert Marcuse, the plan seemed on track.
</P>
<P>
   In the intervening decades, however, something happened that
Brandeis' founders did not foresee. The Jews' fervent drive for
acceptance, prosperity and a role in shaping American culture
succeeded so well _ partly through the Brandeis' efforts _ that
Brandeis never became the Harvard of the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard became the Harvard of the Jews as did Yale, Columbia,
the University of Pennsylvania and the rest of elite American
colleges, where Jews, who make up 2{ percent of the U.S.
population, typically make up 20 percent of students and faculty
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jews are no longer trying to get into the American academic
establishment,'' said Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg, a historian of
American Jewry. ``They are the academic establishment. The problem
Brandeis had come to solve has been solved.''
</P>
<P>
   But solutions are sometimes only new problems in disguise. As
Brandeis alumni and friends gathered this weekend to celebrate the
50th anniversary of their Jewish-sponsored, non-sectarian
university _ the old handful of broken buildings linked by dirt
paths now a groomed 235-acre campus _ they are struggling with the
question of how to position their institution in its middle age.
</P>
<P>
   Other universities created to serve specific groups at certain
historical moments, like black and women's colleges and even some
small religious schools, are also struggling to reinvent
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Brandeis, as Israel has become secure, as the
generation that suffered the Holocaust dies, as Jews continue to
rise freely through the ranks of politics, industry and the media,
Brandeis and American Jewry together face a challenge unprecedented
in Jewish history: How to forge an identity divorced from
persecution?
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you do when all the choices are yours,'' asked Gary
Tobin, a Brandeis professor of Jewish studies, ``when you can't
blame external forces, when there is no hostile environment to mold
your ideology?
</P>
<P>
   ``Brandeis doesn't want to be thought of as reclusive, separate,
disintegrated from American life. It has to find a balance. In the
same way that a Jew has to decide what it means to be an
assimilated Jew, Brandeis has to figure out what it means to be an
assimilated university.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the chosen solution is through a conscious
internationalism and emphasis on ethics that officials like
Brandeis president Jehuda Reinharz believe can be illuminated by
the Jewish tradition.
</P>
<P>
   So Friday, right after the Brandeis festivities began with a
picnic lunch, the first event was a symposium on ``Human Rights:
The Unfinished Agenda.'' Among the speakers was Shen Tong, a
Brandeis graduate who was one of the organizers of the Tiananmen
Square protest in Beijing in 1989. The university has also just
opened a $13 million international center on the study of ethics
and social justice.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl was the commencement
speaker and the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet,
was a campus guest.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, such internationalism has been accompanied by an
increased Jewish emphasis within. The neglected Jewish studies
department has been rebuilt, the kosher food areas have been
greatly improved and expanded and there are a couple hundred
Orthodox Jews among the 3,000 undergraduates. There are also a
small number of strictly Orthodox students who had, until recently,
never considered Brandeis because it was seen as insufficiently
Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   The diversity of Jewish life on campus might be expected to
produce tensions, as it has in Israel. But one of Brandeis' goals
is to find a way for different kinds of Jews to live together.
</P>
<P>
   Sabbath dinner under the auspices of Hillel, the foundation that
promotes Jewish life on American campuses, is a good example. Every
Friday night, several hundred young Jews celebrate together: Reform
men with earrings sitting near black-coated Orthodox men and
Conservative women in colorful yarmulkes.
</P>
<P>
   Such dinners, with their singing and high-minded discussions
afterwards, suggest a role for the university in the debate over
identity: as an advocate of Jewish pluralism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most of us agree that for Brandeis to flourish in the
1990s, it must give expression to its Jewish character,'' said
Michael Sandel, a professor of government at Harvard who is a
Brandeis graduate and board member. ``There are many ways to do
that but one is to serve as a forum for debate over competing
visions for Jewish life.''

 &HT;    Famed museum inspires elegant designs
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGH POINT, N.C. _ The last thing you probably want is for your
living room to look like a museum.
</P>
<P>
   But the pieces that the John Widdicomb furniture company has
selected to reproduce from London's famed Victoria &AMP; Albert Museum
are not only elegant but inviting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is English furniture from a period that's comfortable,''
said the company's Hugh Griffith, as he unveiled the Victoria &AMP;
Albert Collection this week at the International Home Furnishings
Market, which continues through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The museum was founded in 1852 to encourage excellence in
design. It houses nearly 5 million objects, including the finest
furniture from every period and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Widdicomb has interpreted 14 pieces, mainly from England's
traditional Georgian and Regency eras. The designs, including
Chippendales and Hepplewhites, include an elegant inlaid rosewood
table decorated with a geometric band of parquetry in walnut and
burl. A gold upholstered camelback sofa with high scrolled arms is
embellished with plush cushions. A gilt console table has a marble
top and intricate moldings.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces are expected to retail for $5,400 to $23,000,
Griffith said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the museum holds extensive archives, companies licensed
to design reproductions are granted access to a wealth of furniture
drawings.
</P>
<P>
   And given the Victoria &AMP; Albert's mission to inspire exceptional
design, it's possible, said Michelle Alfandari of V&AMP;A Enterprises,
the museum's commercial arm, that even today's pieces could someday
find a home in a museum.

 UNDATED: Jewish life.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For non-Jews, the Jewish emphasis can be both intriguing and
alienating. Sucheta Puranik, a junior from Wallingford, Conn., said
it was fascinating to watch Jews, who are so used to being in the
minority, feel in charge. But she said she joined the campus
intercultural center to find others who feel a bit left out during
Jewish holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Brandeis has trouble attracting African-Americans despite
strenuous efforts to do so, including two programs that bring
inner-city youths to campus. Blacks make up less than three percent
of the student population.
</P>
<P>
   In its early years, Brandeis' goal was not Jewish pluralism but
the purest assimilation. Again, Harvard and other elite
universities founded by religious communities were the models.
Until 1937, for example, all presidents of Brown University were
Baptists, many of them ministers. Today Brown, like the others, is
a center of secularism.
</P>
<P>
   So, the theory went, it would be for Brandeis, which is
Jewish-sponsored but non-sectarian, unlike Yeshiva University,
which requires students to take a heavy load of courses in Jewish
studies. The Brandeis student body began overwhelmingly Jewish but
quickly became more diverse, with 40 percent non-Jewish students.
The faculty has long had a mix of backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Brandeis had become emblematic of major college trends. Not only
had it served as a bohemian intellectual center in the 1950s but in
the 1960s it became synonymous with the 1960s. Brandeis became the
National Student Strike Information Center. In 1970 two Brandeis
students were on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List for taking part in
an armed robbery that stemmed from their political beliefs.
LSD-laced punch was served by half-naked students in the middle of
campus.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, when many Jews turned their attention and money
toward Israel, Brandeis found itself without the resources or
leadership of more established universities. This was partly
because, unlike Vanderbilt, Duke, Rice or Vassar, Brandeis was not
named for its chief donor but for its main inspiration. Brandeis
depended upon, as it still does, what it calls its foster alumni _
American Jews _ for support.
</P>
<P>
   But as American Jews became fully integrated, they patronized
other institutions; support for Brandeis waned and the quality of
its students declined. Some of the university's supporters began to
worry that Brandeis' frank Jewishness was a liability.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, when Evelyn Handler was president of
Brandeis, a committee of students and trustees examined ways to
reduce the university's Jewish character. Gustav Ranis, a professor
of international economics at Yale and a member of Brandeis' first
graduating class, led the committee, which actually bore the name
``Dejudification.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to attract more non-Jews, particularly Asians, and
the committee decided a relaxation of Jewish dietary restrictions
would help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recommended that there be one place on campus where pork
and shellfish could be consumed,'' Professor Ranis said. ``Evelyn
Handler ran with it and announced it. There was a huge negative
response in the American Jewish community. Jews who didn't
themselves keep kosher wanted Brandeis to keep kosher.''
</P>
<P>
   Its finances a mess, its reputation sullied, its mission
muddied, Brandeis was the subject of major newspaper articles
describing its identity crisis. The board urged Ms. Handler to
resign.
</P>
<P>
   Salvation appeared in the guise of a physician. Dr. Samuel
Thier, then president of the Institute of Medicine under the
National Academy of Sciences, served as Brandeis president for
three crucial, stabilizing years. Having served on the faculties of
Yale, Penn and Harvard, Thier said he saw the quality of Brandeis
and its faculty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here was this place with spectacular scientists, really first
class, yet they were feeling miserable,'' Thier recalled. ``The
institution was young but it was part of a tradition thousands of
years old. To me, it looked like a recovery just waiting to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   As Jonathan Sarna, a professor of American Jewish history at
Brandeis, put it: ``Brandeis was like a guy named Mendelssohn
trying to pretend that he's not Jewish. Once that came to an end,
things improved quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Pork and shrimp were removed from the cafeteria. Dr. Reinharz,
then a Zionist historian at Brandeis, was named provost. American
Jews were told that Brandeis still thought of itself as Jewish and
that its future depended on their support.
</P>
<P>
   No one grasped the importance of that support as clearly as
Reinharz, who took over the presidency in 1994. Reinharz, 54, born
in Palestine, now Israel, is fiercely devoted to Brandeis, where he
earned his Ph.D.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling around the country, often accompanied by his wife,
Shulamit, a Brandeis professor of sociology and women's studies,
Reinharz has given a new face to the institution. He has also
grasped the value of celebrity, attracting people like Ann Richards
and Anita Hill to the campus as visiting lecturers and persuading
former Labor Secretary Robert Reich to take a professorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I have done is really clearly define and articulate what
we are all about,'' he said. ``Tempering our Jewish identity did
not work. I have defined our mission very clearly and without
embarrassment as having four pillars: Jewish sponsorship, total
non-sectarianism, a commitment to social justice and excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   It is on the pillar of excellence, that Brandeis sees its work
most clearly in the future. Applications are brisk, and the use of
merit scholarship has brought some first-class students to
Brandeis. But the university still suffers from being a second
choice for many of the brightest on campus. It has been frustrated
at not being able to crack the top 25 list in the university
rankings put out by such publications as U.S. News &AMP; World Report.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent book by Hugh David Graham and Nancy Diamond, ``The
Rise of American Research Universities,'' (Johns Hopkins, 1997)
ranked schools based on faculty publications and citations. After
controlling for institutional size, it ranked Brandeis ninth
overall and first among a group of ``rising'' research
universities.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven people on its faculty are members of the National Academy
of Sciences and 27 belong to the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences, high numbers for a small institution.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by not veering far from a Jewish identity, Brandeis faces a
potential problem in attracting the very best from all walks of
life.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Levine, president of Teachers College at Columbia
University, said Brandeis, from which he graduated, must ``find a
way to translate the values of religion without making it
religious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Brandeis loses its Jewishness it becomes just another
university and pushes away its donor base,'' Levine said.
``Moreover, Brandeis faces the same challenges as all research
universities. For the first time since the days Brandeis was
founded, universities are not a growth industry.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the calculation that Reinharz has made: Money and
mission rely on Brandeis' Jewish roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt that at any point we will just decide this is an
excellent university and call it a day on the Jewish issue,''
Reinharz said. ``I see a very strong Jewish link throughout
Brandeis' future. There will never be a day when we at Brandeis
will say, `Now we know what we are about.' The process is the point
and the process will always go on.''

   BOOMERS-HEALTH (Undated) _ Aging baby boomers and their elderly

   KRALJANE, Yugoslavia _ At lunchtime Friday, as Shkurte Ismajli
was kneading dough in a tin pan on the floor of her makeshift
kitchen in this village, she heard the thud of a mortar.
</P>
<P>
   Then sniper fire. Then the sound of a truck, loaded with Serbian
policemen as it rumbled by and headed for the nearby school house
where the Serbs had staked out a position for firing against the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army across the valley.
</P>
<P>
   This was not a major battle of the conflict in Kosovo, but the
exchange of fire and the movement of Serbian security policemen on
the third day of a NATO deadline suggested that sporadic fighting
was continuing in the province.
</P>
<P>
   The incident, high on a lush green mountain ridge, indicated how
difficult it will be for the 2,000 unarmed monitors who are
expected to arrive here in the coming weeks to insure that the
Serbian military has withdrawn soldiers and policemen as called for
in an agreement brokered by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 50 diplomatic monitors who have been working in
Kosovo for the last four months and who will form the leadership of
the 2,000 international monitors are asking questions:
</P>
<P>
   What happens during fighting like Friday's if one side decides
to take a monitor as a hostage? Who are the monitors going to
report their daily findings to? And what are the levels that the
Serbian troops are allowed to keep? How many troops are supposed to
leave?
</P>
<P>
   So far, said a monitor from the European Union, a few matters
like these have not been decided. ``There will be 50 of us to begin
with,'' he said. ``We are being asked to do intrusive observations
_ and what is our security?''
</P>
<P>
   The monitor said he was not convinced that a NATO rapid reaction
force based in the Adriatic was adequate protection for unarmed
civilians who would be asked to check on whether troops were in
barracks and whether the security police had pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   NATO on Friday extended by 10 days the deadline for Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to comply with the demands of the
agreement he made with Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the deadline expired early Saturday morning. Then, an
``activation order,'' permitting NATO air strikes, was scheduled to
come into effect if Milosevic had not made sufficient progress in
pulling out troops.
</P>
<P>
   The grace period, granted at a NATO meeting in Brussels on
Tuesday, appeared to give ``fudging time'' that was needed for a
variety of reasons. It allowed Milosevic to proceed with his
withdrawal and yet not force NATO to attack.
</P>
<P>
   And it gave the underfinanced and understaffed Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, the 54-nation Vienna-based
group, which has been asked to organize the 2,000 monitors, more
time to gather the group.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said there was concern about a vacuum if the deadline
for Milosevic expired and there were only a handful of monitors on
the ground in Kosovo. The chairman of the Vienna organization,
Bronislaw Geremek, signed an agreement in Belgrade on Friday
authorizing the 2,000 monitors to come to Kosovo with Yugoslav
Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanic.
</P>
<P>
   Geremek said he had received offers of 800 volunteers from
member countries, which include the United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But he was not specific about how long it would take to train,
equip and station the monitors in the countryside, where more than
250,000 ethnic Albanian refugees who have been uprooted by the
fighting are waiting to return to their villages.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of the roles envisioned for the monitors is to provide a
security blanket to the refugees as they struggle back to ruined
homes, where Serbian forces have burned roofs, interiors, and food
supplies, cut electricity, stolen household goods and killed
livestock.
</P>
<P>
   In Kraljane, a fairly well-to-do village in an area of strength
for the separatist guerrillas, it was clear that the presence of
outside monitors could be of significant psychological and
practical help in persuading residents to come back and restore
their shattered lives.
</P>
<P>
   The village was shelled and many houses burned by the Serbs in
late August and has remained largely uninhabited ever since.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, because it was virtually empty, the village
presented an ideal base for the Serbian forces who wanted to fire
out of the village toward suspected guerrillas bases around
Jablanica, a stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ismajli, 47, said she and her family of 10 children had
come back here 10 days after fleeing in August. They have tried to
rebuild part of their burned home, which is a series of buildings
grouped around a courtyard with fruit trees and roaming chickens.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian forces in two armored personnel carriers and several
trucks began rolling by her home _ which like many in this region
is surrounded by a high wall _ on Thursday afternoon, she said. Her
eldest children, young men in their 20s, immediately fled into the
hills because they were frightened of being captured as suspected
guerrillas. The younger children aged 9 and up were terrified
Friday, and remained huddled behind the garden door.
</P>
<P>
   One of the concerns in such a situation, Mrs. Ismajli said, was
that if the Serbian forces suffered casualties from the guerrillas,
her family could become targets of revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are still not leaving us alone, even though we've chosen
to come back to our burned-out house,'' said Mrs. Ismajli, her
hands covered with flour and her voice trembling with emotion.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Confidence stemming from the Federal Reserve Board's
second interest rate cut in three weeks spread further through
financial markets Friday, as stock prices registered strong gains
in heavy trading and bond yields fell.

soared more than 330 points Thursday in an enthusiastic response to
the rate reductions orchestrated by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan,
advanced another 117.40, or 1.41 percent, to 8,416.76. For the
week, the blue-chip index was up 6.55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Broader market averages also posted healthy gains.
</P>
<P>
   Capping its best week in 14 years, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index rose 8.93 points, or nine-tenths of 1 percent to 1,056.42.
For the week, the index gained 7.31 percent, its best showing since
the week of Sept. 3, 1984, according to Birinyi &AMP; Associates.
</P>
<P>
   And the Nasdaq composite index concluded its best week in 24
years, rising 9.94 points, or six-tenths of 1 percent, to 1,620.95.
For the week, the Nasdaq, home of many fast-growing technology
companies, soared 8.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The benefit of what Mr. Greenspan did for stocks on Thursday
is not so much an indication that the Fed will provide liquidity to
the system, but to instill a sense of confidence in the system
again,'' said Jonathan Olesky, head of block trading at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some degree, things have shut down in financial markets,
due to a loss of confidence,'' Olesky said, referring to what has
happened since Russia defaulted on its sovereign debt in August.
``You don't have to look very far now to realize that people are
much more constructive on the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The gains left all three major indexes in positive territory for
the year. Since the first day of trading in January, the Dow is up
6.4 percent, the S&AMP;P 500 is up 8.9 percent and the Nasdaq composite
is up 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of small companies, which have been battered so far this
year, also finished with strong gains.
</P>
<P>
   Two stocks rose for every one that fell in price. The Russell
2000 index of smaller-company shares gained 8.06 points, or 2.4
percent, to 342.87. At more than 1 billion shares, volume on the
New York Stock Exchange was the fourth-busiest in the history of
the Big Board.
</P>
<P>
   In large measure, the interest rate cuts by the Fed have
generated hope among investors that the central bank will do all it
can to avert a downturn in the American economy by cutting interest
rates further.
</P>
<P>
   The sense that the Fed is prepared to cut the overnight Federal
funds rate, currently at 5 percent, still further is readily
apparent in the credit markets.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although yields on 30-year Treasury bonds rose marginally, to
4.98 percent from 4.97 Thursday, the rate on three-month Treasury
bills, the rate most sensitive to changes in the overnight Federal
funds rate, fell by 30 basis points, to a bond equivalent yield of
3.61 percent. It was the biggest one-day drop in the three-month
bill rate since the summer of 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to get more rate cuts, maybe at the next Fed
meeting in November,'' said Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist
at A.G. Edwards in St. Louis. ``The Fed is our friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Short-term rates were also responding Friday to continued rumors
that a big bank or other financial institution is near failure.
</P>
<P>
   As they often have in recent days, the rumors focused on the
health of Bankers Trust, which is expected to release its
third-quarter earnings report next week.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Bankers Trust came under heavy selling pressure in the
stock market, losing 5 9/16, to 51 5/16, on a day when most
financial stocks posted good gains.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, prices of regional bank stocks, which have lost about
one-third of their value since July, were among the market's
leaders Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One gained 2 13/16, to 47 15/16. Keycorp climbed 2 15/16,
to 31 1/8. U.S. Bancorp rose 1 3/8, to 40 15/16. And SunTrust
gained 1 1/8, to 68 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation stocks, led by airlines, roared ahead. The Dow
Jones transportation index jumped 116.59 points, or 4.4 percent, to
close at 2780.87.
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest gainers were Delta Air Lines, which rose 4
1/2, to 98. AMR, parent of American Airlines, gained 1 7/8, to 56
3/8. And US Airways Group gained 4 5/16, to 54 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes that the Fed might be able to stave off a recession helped
to lift cyclical stocks Friday, as prices of automobile, steel and
chemical companies all rose.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors gained 2 15/16, to 59. Ford Motor was up 2 1/16,
to 50 13/16. And USX gained 1 3/8, to 23 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dow is up almost 1,000 points since its close on Oct. 8,''
Goldman said. ``We are not going to just sail from here, but I
think we saw the lows on Aug. 31.'' &QL;

<P>
   One school of technology investing hews to a simple strategy:
Follow the leadership. The shares of so-called leadership companies
may not look cheap by conventional measures, say price-to-earnings
or price-to-book ratios. But because the leaders define standards
the rest of the industry must follow, they will always command a
disproportionate share of earnings and growth. Therefore the
leaders will always bounce back from setbacks to deliver
market-beating returns, or so the school teaches.
</P>
<P>
   The Intel Corp. is incontrovertibly a leadership company. Indeed
it may be the leadership company of its generation. Intel invented
the microprocessor and the dynamic random access memory chip and it
continues to push the performance envelope today. It is also
broadly acknowledged to be a superbly run company.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the fact that the stock, which closed Friday at
$83.75, has fallen 16.6 percent from last year's high of $100.50 on
Aug. 20 and that its current P/E ratio of 24.1 is below that of of
the overall market's, and it is easy to reach a conclusion. A
technology investor has no choice but to own Intel, right?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But not everyone believes Intel is a compelling buy at
the current price. Some point out that it is well above its 52-week
low of $65.65625, reached on June 3. And they are not at all sure
this leadership thing is what it's cracked up to be.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the debate timely are the better-than-expected
third-quarter earnings released last week. Bulls point to that
report as a clear sign that personal computer makers have worked
through a glut of inventory that depressed sales in the first half
of the year. Intel had originally forecast that third-quarter
revenues would be flat relative to the second quarter's, later
amended that to a gain of 8 percent to 10 percent and actually
reported a 14 percent gain. Many analysts expect a robust fourth
quarter, too.
</P>
<P>
   But the bears doubt that the current growth is sustainable. They
say buyers no longer need to increase processing power on a regular
basis and that Intel faces reinvigorated competition. As evidence
of the strength of this argument, Intel's shares fell $1 the day
after the earnings announcement.
</P>
<P>
   So far, even the bears are not placing great emphasis on an
antitrust lawsuit filed against Intel in June by the Federal Trade
Commission. For starters, Intel's hold on the desktop is not nearly
so absolute as that of the Microsoft Corp. Still, it belongs on the
list of worries for Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Count Mark Edelstone, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, among the Intel bulls. He has a strong buy recommendation
on the stock and a target share price of $110. ``I don't think
these results would indicate anything other than that Intel will
remain a leadership stock,'' he said. Edelstone expects demand to
be strong enough in the fourth quarter that Intel will enter 1999
with a backlog.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock
Letter, has been predicting that Intel might hit $120 by year-end.
He expects money to flow from ``old economy'' stocks like Gillette
and Coca-Cola to ``new economy'' stocks like technology companies
as it becomes apparent that only the Intels of the world can
deliver double-digit sales and earnings growth in a recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get the disconnect between old economy stocks and new
economy stocks that we expect, Intel can sell for 30 times 1999
earnings,'' Murphy said, giving it a price of $120 by his estimate.
He said he presumed that in the event of a recession next year,
companies would continue buying personal computers to drive up
productivity and remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Companies did just that in the last recession, in the early
'90s, driven by the need to move old mainframe-based applications
to client-server systems.The spread of Microsoft's Windows 3.1 and
the related Office suite of applications drove demand for more
powerful processors.
</P>
<P>
   But the climate has changed. The big demand drivers are the
Internet and electronic commerce, which are limited less by
microprocessor power than by bandwidth. And on most of today's real
world applications, there is little benefit in upgrading from a
166-megahertz Pentium to a 300-megahertz Pentium II. Windows 98
does not require more power than Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Peck, an analyst with Cowen &AMP; Co., said he did not believe
Intel will be the profit and growth machine it once was. ``For
Intel to sustain this quarter's level of growth and profit requires
a strong step up in PC demand,'' he said. ``That's a difficult bet
to make.'' He rates Intel a ``trading buy,'' meaning it should be
bought on dips and sold on pops.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is possible to admire Intel the company but not
Intel the stock. ``This is undeniably one of the great business
franchises in our economy,'' said Roger McNamee, a principal in
Integral Partners, a fund specializing in technology stocks. But he
said the diminished need for ever greater processing power, even
more than greater competition, will lead to ever shorter product
cycles and ever shorter periods in which Intel can charge a premium
for its latest, fastest processors. ``I think its going to have
lower highs and lower lows,'' he said.

INVESTING WITH: GARY LEWIS OF VAN KAMPEN EMERGING GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Oct. 18) 
(JT) 
 By WILLIAM R. LONG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I've got a calm personality, so I don't get too excited when
we go way up, and I don't get too down when we go way down,'' Gary
Lewis, the manager of the Van Kampen Emerging Growth fund, said
from his 45th-floor office in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   This is fortunate, for funds like Lewis', invested in mid-cap
stocks with relatively high price-to-earnings ratios, have taken it
on the chin. Through Oct. 9, the fund has lost 29.8 percent since
the market's peak on July 17, nearly double the 16.7 percent lost
by the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index of large-cap stocks, and even a
tad worse than its average peer mid-cap growth fund, which lost
29.4 percent, according to Morningstar, the Chicago financial
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the fund's assets have fallen from more than
$4.8 billion at the market peak to $3.47 billion now, it has yet to
see significant defections. Apparently investors and brokers have
faith in Lewis' impressive long-term record.
</P>
<P>
   Since Lewis, 45, started managing Van Kampen Emerging Growth in
April 1989, the fund has returned 17.5 percent annually on average
through Oct. 9, compared with 11.8 percent for its peers and 16.6
percent for the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   How does Lewis cope with these careening markets? Discipline. He
keeps adhering to his basic investing principles. It may not
prevent investors from losing money in a selloff, he said, but
picking and holding the right stocks can keep a portfolio poised
for a comeback when the market turns.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis looks for two basic characteristics in a stock. First, he
wants companies identified by Wall Street analysts as likely to see
their earnings grow, generally at a rate of 20 percent or more
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Second, in what must seem heretical to value-oriented investors,
Lewis seeks out companies whose price-to-earnings ratios are on the
rise, believing that increasing ratios are the market's way of
showing that further good news is around the corner. He also
sometimes looks at price-to-sales ratios, especially for companies
whose earnings might be skewed by such things as one-time expenses
and write-offs.
</P>
<P>
   A price-to-earnings or price-to-sales ratio that is not rising
is a sign of trouble with a company, he believes, even if earnings
estimates and earnings are increasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That tells us that the company is delivering great
fundamentals, but for some reason the market is not rewarding them
for those good fundamentals,'' Lewis said. He believes that the
reason is usually that ``the market is starting to anticipate that
those fundamentals are going to change.'' A stock in this situation
may become a candidate for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis rejects the term ``momentum investor,'' often applied to
adherents of high price-to-earnings investing, because he looks
closely at fundamentals and does not indiscriminately buy companies
with rising earnings. For example, he uses a yardstick common to
growth investors: he prefers a stock whose P/E ratio is lower than
the number associated with its forecasted one-year earnings growth
rate.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis acknowledges that his frameworks for decisions to sell are
not well suited for market downdrafts, when P/E ratios drop no
matter what the fundamentals of the companies are. But in more
bullish markets, he said, ``It's a good early warning indicator
that there is a change in perception.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for example, the fund had big investments in
petroleum-industry service companies. ``All those companies had
huge earnings growth expectations,'' Lewis said. However, their
valuations started dropping in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of the first quarter, we were basically out of the
group,'' he said, and the stocks, already falling by then,
subsequently sold off with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's biggest holding is Dell Computer, which he started
buying in 1996 and which now accounts for 6.6 percent of the
portfolio. Lewis paid an average price of about $4.50. Dell closed
last week at $56.6875.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we bought the stock in mid-1996 and the fall of 1996, we
had a lot of Wall Street analysts downgrading the company because
the stock had appreciated up to 15 times trailing earnings,'' Lewis
said. ``But today, the company is at 60 times trailing earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Another technology stock, Yahoo Inc., is the fund's 12th-largest
holding. Lewis acknowledged that the booming Internet company's
share price is steep. It traded at 269.5 times 1998 earnings last
Friday. But its 1998 earnings growth should grow by far more than
that, he said. Lewis started buying the stock early this year, and
paid an average of $51. Yahoo closed last week at $115.625.
</P>
<P>
   When Lewis began moving into the retail sector last year, one of
his biggest buys was Best Buy, which sells personal computers,
software and consumer electronics. He began buying shares last fall
at an average price of about $22. Best Buy closed at $41 last week.
</P>
<P>
   To track valuation on this company, Lewis said, he looks more at
the price-to-sales ratio than at the price-to-earnings multiple.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you looked at a chart of its price-to-sales ratio, you
could see it's going straight up,'' he said. ``That's the kind of
thing that clues us in as to there's a real strong fundamental
change.''
</P>
<P>
   He said in the case of Best Buy, there were a lot of factors at
work. Many of the company's competitors have closed since 1996,
Best Buy has changed its product mix for better customer appeal and
profitability, and a shift to digital electronics is spurring
demand for its products.
</P>
<P>
   A recession could change that, and ``Wall Street is buying into
a pretty serious recession'' in 1999, he said. But he does not
believe such predictions, even though stock prices have been hit
hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I don't think there's a fundamental basis for what
we've been seeing in the market,'' he said. ``There's just a lot of
panic going on.''

RATES DOWN, STOCKS UP. STILL ... 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., Oct. 18)  
(JT) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, the Federal Reserve may have been stingy when it cut its
short-term interest rate target by only a quarter of a percentage
point at its last policy meeting Sept. 29. But on Thursday, just 16
days later, it more than made up for that, slicing off another
quarter point. As if to add emphasis to the central bank's message
that it is alert to the world's financial problems _ especially
that of its banks _ this cut came in between the regularly
scheduled meetings of the policy-setting Federal Open Market
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were ecstatic. After the afternoon announcement from
the Fed, it took the Dow Jones industrial average less than 45
minutes to surge nearly 300 points. The rally continued Friday.
</P>
<P>
   And more upbeat news is on its way. The odds are good for more
reductions by the Fed in its short-term interest rate target, the
federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks. After the last
two moves, the Fed funds rate is now 5 percent. But by March,
investors are expecting that rate to drop to an average of 4.23
percent, based on the current price for the March Fed funds futures
contract.
</P>
<P>
   All this is positive. But the signs of world financial distress
still abound. Japan is working on banking reform, but its economy
is still a mess. Congress has approved more money for the
International Monetary Fund, but the United States and its allies
still need to agree on new rescue strategies for the IMF. And there
are many Wall Street firms and banks that still have big bets on
bonds and other investments that have _ or can _ go sour.
</P>
<P>
   These problems are reflected in the spreads _ the difference
between the yields on U.S. Treasury securities and other bonds,
like corporate, mortgage, junk or emerging market. These spreads
have surged since the Russian debt crisis. And although they have
come down some, they are still quite high.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday, the yield on emerging markets bonds was 12.22
percentage points above comparable Treasury maturities, according
to a J.P. Morgan index of emerging market bonds. That was down from
a high of 17.05 percentage points on Sept. 10 but still twice the 6
percentage point spread in July.
</P>
<P>
   The spread for American junk bonds, according to a Merrill Lynch
monthly index, was at 5.73 percentage points at the end of last
month, more than 2 percentage points higher than in June. The
spread for investment grade corporate debt was at 1.70 percentage
points, higher than it was during the 1990-91 recession.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is clear. At these levels, interest rates are
strangling the flow of credit to corporations and countries, which
cannot afford to borrow. And if banks reduce their risk-taking and
curtail their lending, the economy will slow sharply, and could
even fall into a recession.
</P>
<P>
   The spreads reflect two different worries, said Michael
Rosenberg, head of international fixed-income research at Merrill
Lynch. ``There is the worry of increased default and a recession
coming,'' he said. ``Also, there is the worry that a significant
part of the investment community may still be leveraged and has to
sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Allyn, the chief economist at Scudder Kemper
Investments, added: ``The new risk is that markets are in control
of who gets credit and who doesn't.'' And that may mean so much
control has been turned over to the markets that authorities _ like
the Fed _ ``do not have the levers to do what they need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why these spreads are an important monitor for
investors. Until they shrink back to more normal levels, the
chances of an economic slowdown will be much greater. And until
they shrink, there will still be a good chance that hedge funds,
like Long-Term Capital Management, and some Wall Street firms, as
well, will face the kind of losses that, when reported, could
trigger a selloff.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no all-clear signal until spreads come in,'' Ms.
Allyn said.

LEFTIST CHOSEN TO FORM NEW GOVERNMENT IN ITALY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Massimo D'Alema, a former Communist and leader of the
largest leftist party in Italy, was selected Friday to try to form
a new government.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema, 49, was chosen after Acting Prime Minister Romano
Prodi, who resigned after losing a confidence vote last week,
failed to gather enough support in Parliament to form a new
government.
</P>
<P>
   If D'Alema succeeds in cobbling together a majority among
Italy's many splintered political factions, Italy will fit even
more closely with the European wave of social democratic
governments or at least some of them.
</P>
<P>
   Prodi, a pragmatic economist with centrist views, was closer in
outlook to Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain. In background and
political approach, D'Alema resembles the Socialist prime minister
of France, Lionel Jospin, and Gerhard Schroeder, the German
chancellor-elect. Like them, he will face the challenge of marrying
social democratic aspirations with the austerity measures already
written into a unified European economic system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel the weight of conflicts and expectations,'' D'Alema
said after accepting the mandate. ``And I will try to do what I can
do to lessen the conflicts and to not betray the expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema was also referring to the narrow political shoals he has
been maneuvering in his search for a majority. The leader of
Democrats of the Left, a party he helped form out of the embers of
the Italian Communist party after the fall of the Soviet Union, he
said he thought he could count on the support of some Communists
and also on a small center-right party led by Francesco Cossiga.
</P>
<P>
   If D'Alema and Cossiga reach agreement, it would put D'Alema in
the position of leading a center-left coalition with more centrist
votes in it than his more moderate predecessor had. D'Alema
explained his entente cordiale with Cossiga, a former Christian
Democrat and president of Italy, this way: ``President Cossiga is
telling our country that the Cold War is over and that the men and
ideas that openly fought for many years can also collaborate.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders, including Silvio Berlusconi, the media
tycoon and former conservative prime minister, were outraged by
Cossiga's defection, calling it a fraud.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema is counting on another fallout from the end of the Cold
War: the split among the Communists that occurred after hard-liners
withdrew their support from Prodi.
</P>
<P>
   Prodi's coalition relied on Communist Refounding, the party that
remained after leaders like D'Alema became ex-Communists and formed
new, non-Marxist factions. The general secretary of Communist
Refounding, Fausto Bertinotti, refused to accept the 1999 budget.
</P>
<P>
   That drove Armando Cossutta, president of Communist Refounding,
to quit and form his own party, unwilling to be associated with the
Communists who caused the leftist government to collapse. D'Alema
made it clear he was not planning to horse-trade to win Bertinotti
back into the fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turn to him and say that his request that we redraft the
budget is mistaken. It is a good budget. And if his `no' does not
change, it means the government will have to be formed from the
political parties that accept the budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy badly needs to pass a budget that cuts $9 billion from the
deficit to meet the requirements to enter the single European
monetary unit, the euro, on Jan. 1, 1999. And Italy also badly
needs to regain an image of stability, which was shaken by the
defeat of Prodi, who managed to get Italy into the euro with
stringent fiscal austerity measures in his two and a half years in
office _ the second-longest period in postwar history.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Loyal to Prodi even when Communist hard-liners rebelled against
Prodi's centrist policies, D'Alema never successfully hid his
ambition to succeed Prodi. Their styles are very different: Prodi,
a low-key, self-deprecating former economics professor, was an
approachable technocrat. D'Alema, a former head of the Communist
youth league and editor of the Communist newspaper Unita, is a
lifelong politician who is described even by his friends as
reserved and humorless.
</P>
<P>
   But both men share a desire to reform Italy's fractured and
chronically unstable political system by introducing a two-party
system. D'Alema led a drive in Parliament to amend the constitution
accordingly, but suffered a humiliating defeat when Berlusconi
pulled the plug.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, he vowed to resume the effort, saying, ``This
crisis highlights the defect in our system and requires a new
government and a rekindling of a dialogue so that in the remainder
of the term, we can tackle electoral reform and constitutional
change.''

NOSTALGIC, JOHN PAUL II CELEBRATES 20 YEARS AS POPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also POPE-ENCYCLICAL) 
(js) 
 BY ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ John Paul II celebrated his 20th anniversary as pope
Friday by revisiting his past.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared at a window at St. Peter's Basilica shortly before 7
p.m. as tens of thousands of well-wishers gathered beneath to hear
and watch by live television hook-up the ringing of the bells of
Krakow Cathedral, just as they had rung at the same time on Oct.
16, 1978.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, he held an emotional outdoor Mass at St.
Peter's, packed with 25,000 Polish pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
   The 78-year-old pope drove in an open white papal jeep through
cheering crowds holding up Polish flags and Solidarity banners _
nostalgic reminders of how in the earliest days of his pontificate,
the pope embraced the cause of the independent Polish trade union
that helped topple Communism.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who 20 years ago said the words ``be not afraid'' at
his inauguration Mass, is now frail, stooped, often in pain and
shaking from the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, he asked his fellow Poles for their help. ``For many
years I have been preparing with the entire church to cross into
the third millennium,'' the pope said. ``I ask you to pray so that
I can carry to the end the work that God entrusted to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From the hill of Wawel, Christ called me to the Hills of the
Vatican, from the tomb of St. Stanislaus to the tomb of St. Peter,
so that I could lead the church along the path to conciliar
renewal,'' the pope said. ``My homeland's good is my good, what
hurts it, dishonors it or threatens it becomes a part of me, a part
of my heart, a part of my thoughts and a part of my feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled how Polish prayers helped him recover from the
assassination attempt on May 13, 1981, in the same square in which
he spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to speak of this without being overcome with
emotion,'' he said. ``You were in prayer for all that time. You
were then particularly united with me with binds of solidarity and
spiritual closeness.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II is the longest-serving pope in this century, and
his pontificate has been marked by paradoxes. A charismatic leader
who has traveled all over the world to restore evangelical zeal to
the Catholic Church, he was a playwright, poet and intellectual who
once wanted to join a monastery. A Pole who grew up in the shadow
of Nazi totalitarianism and Communism, he used his pulpit to help
defeat Communism.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Berlin Wall fell, he turned his attention and
irritation on what he saw as the materialism, selfishness and
social injustices of capitalism and Western society.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   His papacy is marked by a return to rigid conformity in
doctrinal matters. He has tried to rein in Catholics on issues like
abortion, homosexuality, priestly celibacy and women's ordination
and has rigorously clamped down on dissent in dioceses and Catholic
universities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in his latest encyclical, ``Fides et Ratio'' (``Faith and
Reason''), issued on Thursday, the pope urged theologians to seek
greater freedom of thought and philosophical inquiry to discover
the truth as long as that truth is God.
</P>
<P>
   After a long day of celebration and commemorations on Italian
television, John Paul gave a brief, quiet farewell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to give thanks for the last 20 years in the life of the
Universal Church, the church and of course for my life,'' the pope
said from his window on Thursday night.

FED-GENERATED OPTIMISM SENDS ASIAN STOCKS SOARING 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MARK LANDLER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Stock market euphoria swept from the United States
and Europe to Asia on Friday, as share prices across the region
surged in response to Thursday's cut in interest rates in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's gains were among the biggest, with the benchmark
Hang Seng index jumping almost 9 percent, to 9,777.01, the highest
level since early May. Shares in Singapore, Bangkok, Jakarta and
Manila all rose more than 5 percent; in Tokyo, the Nikkei index of
225 issues gained 2.19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While analysts were impressed by the strong performance, which
extends a rally that began last week, most were loath to declare it
a turning point in the Asian financial crisis. Indeed, some said
they were worried that the stock markets had become too rosy a
barometer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been so much bad news built up in the region that
any glimmer of good news causes the market to overshoot,'' said
Brian Lippey, managing director of Tokai Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Lippey said a fundamental recovery in Asia still hinged on
whether Japan could clean up its debt-burdened banking system.
Although the Japanese Parliament completed passage of legislation
Friday intended to do that, Lippey and other experts said it fell
short of the radical overhaul needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gordian knot for Asia is Japan, and the center of that
knot is the Japanese banking system,'' Lippey said. ``Until they
get that sorted out, the rest of Asia is going to be in for more
disappointments.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, from Seoul to Singapore, it was hard to find
disappointment Friday. Here, the Hang Seng index posted one of its
largest gains of the year, on hopes that local banks would follow
the lead of the Federal Reserve in cutting rates. Late Friday, they
reduced the deposit rate by one-quarter of a point, to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed's action suggests that they've diagnosed the problem,
and the response is going to be serious and prompt,'' said Miron
Mushkat, director of strategy at Indocam Asia Asset Management
here.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the lower rates, Hong Kong has been buoyed by the
stronger Japanese yen, which has eased pressure on the Hong Kong
dollar. A weaker yen had hurt Hong Kong because its dollar's
exchange rate is linked to the U.S. dollar. That meant that the
Hong Kong dollar was overvalued relative to other Asian currencies,
and it made this former British colony a relatively costly place to
do business.
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest winners in this market rally is the Hong Kong
government, which spent enormous amounts to prop up the stock
market in August. The intervention, which officials said was
intended to thwart foreign-currency traders, exposed Hong Kong to
widespread criticism abroad and at home.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, Hong Kong's government is sitting on hefty
gains. While the government has not disclosed the market value of
its holdings, analysts estimate that officials started buying $10
billion to $15 billion of stock when the Hang Seng index was at
6,600. The market has since gone up nearly 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opinion is that they got lucky, but it's better to be lucky
than smart,'' said Mac Overton, a portfolio manager at MBF Unit
Trust here, who had harshly criticized the intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the giant banking company HSBC Holdings, which was the
government's largest investment, shot up $12.50 (Hong Kong), or
$1.61 (U.S.) Friday, to $173. Analysts said the demand for shares
of HSBC, parent company of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, was fueled
by rumors that an American hedge fund was trying to buy the
government's 8.9 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that officials here said they intend to retain the
shares for the long term. That means their huge potential profits
are on paper only. Whether the government will be able sell its
shares at a profit depends on whether this rally is merely a
respite from the crisis _ or the start of a genuine recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said lower interest rates could revive business
activity in Asia. But they said it was worth remembering why the
Federal Reserve reduced rates: to forestall an expected slowdown in
the U.S. economy. Such a slowdown bodes ill for Asian countries,
which depend on American consumers to buy their goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, your view of this depends on whether you think
consumer demand in Europe and the U.S. is going to hold up,'' said
Richard Margolis, a regional strategist at Merrill Lynch in Hong
Kong.

WHAT MORE CAN WE DO TO PROTECT THREATENED WOMEN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN McNAMARA 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One Quincy woman is dead, another is presumed to be. One husband
is in custody, another is under suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic violence is back in the headlines with the fatal
shooting of Elizabeth Holland in her Dysart Street home this week
and the disappearance of Katherine Leonard Romano from her Huntress
Street home three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Once again we are reciting the same old cliche: ``A restraining
order is just a piece of paper It can't save women.'' Once more, we
are asking the same old question: ``Can we ever protect women from
violence in their own homes?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer from Quincy District Court Judge Charles Black and
Norfolk County District Attorney Jeffrey Locke seems to be that we
can't. At least, not always. At least, not this time.
</P>
<P>
   Locke insists that Liz Holland did everything right, that the
Quincy police did everything right, that the courts did everything
right in their combined efforts to protect the 31-year-old
operating room technician from an abusive spouse. How is it then
that on Wednesday morning, 8-year-old Patrick Holland found his
mother's battered, bullet-ridden body in a pool of blood in a
corner of an upstairs bedroom?
</P>
<P>
   It is not as though ``the system'' that Locke extols was unaware
of Daniel Holland's penchant for violence toward his wife. Liz
Holland obtained her first court order of protection against him in
1993 from the Quincy District Court, renewed it many times, and
received her last one on Feb. 16 of this year from the Norfolk
County Probate Court.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit filed last winter, Holland outlined the pattern
of violence that defined her marriage. ``In the last week he
knocked me down on the kitchen floor, telling me he was going to
smash my face in, chased me through the house yelling and throwing
things at me,'' she wrote of her estranged husband, a man she was
in the process of divorcing. ``He threw a glass at my head,
shattering it, and overturned a table. All this occurred with
Patrick, age 8, in the immediate area. He threw me to the ground,
pulled me back by the hair when I tried to get up, screamed
obscenites at me and threatened to kill me if I `did anything
stupid.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I have tried to leave the immediate area to allow him to cool
off and he chases me. Once I got as far as the car and he pulled me
out through the window. We have gone to counseling, mediation and,
while it gets better at times, the threat is always'' there.
</P>
<P>
   The threat was there last June when young Patrick handed his
mother the gun he found under a sofa cushion in the living room.
Liz Holland called the police. Violation of a restraining order is
a criminal offense. Her husband denied the gun was his. His denial
was good enough for the officers, who decided there was no probable
cause to arrest Daniel Holland for violating the court's order of
protection.
</P>
<P>
   The court disagreed and issued a criminal complaint. But the
system moved forward none too urgently: Prosecutors did not arraign
Daniel Holland for violating the restraining order until September,
three months after the incident. Judge Black said the district
attorney did not ask for bail, so he set a trial date of Dec. 7 and
let Holland go.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, Liz Holland is dead and Daniel Holland is
charged with first degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   It is always easier to assign blame after the fact than to
prevent tragedies before they occur. It is always easier to talk
about saving battered women than to address the legitimate tension
that exists between protecting the lives of victims and preserving
the rights of defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a case like this, I don't know that anything more could
have been done,'' Judge Black said yesterday. ``The Quincy police
are superb on these cases. They had a close call on probable cause
in the gun incident. The prosecutor could have requested bail, but
should he have? I don't know. We fast-tracked this case to get it
to trial in December. I ask myself what more we could have done to
change the result and, sadly, I don't think there is anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Locke, who handled Holland's arraignment personally this week,
noted that on Tuesday night Liz Holland's killer trapped her
between a wall and a bed while he shot her and beat her with the
rifle butt. ``It appears she did everything she could to get away
without diving out a window,'' Locke said. ``It looks like
Elizabeth Holland was in a state of terror for some period.''
</P>
<P>
   That period of terror did not begin on Tuesday night, Mr. Locke;
that's just when it ended. Elizabeth Holland did do everything she
could do to save herself. Did we?

POWERFUL `AFRICANS IN AMERICA' IS MUST VIEWING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several times during the six hours of ``Africans in America,''
the camera moves reverently over a list of names that were
scrupulously entered into the record by an American owner of
slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Davy Sr. Davy Jr. Fanny. Ellen. Jenny. Dolly. Isaac. Israel.
James.
</P>
<P>
   Cretia. Lilly. Lilburn. Matilda. Lovila. Nancy. Jupiter. Amy.
Joe.
</P>
<P>
   From these names, inscribed neatly in black ink on white paper,
it's easy to imagine the inhumanity: the horror of families ripped
apart, of human liberties abridged, of personal integrity subsumed
by the profit motive.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the most effective devices Orlando Bagwell's
production team uses in this fine PBS documentary _ a film every
American should see at least once, because it's not likely many of
us have spent much time with the subject, no matter how tightly it
is woven into the fabric of this country.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell's work is exhaustive but never tiresome, and it stands
alongside Ken Burns' ``The Civil War'' as one of the great
historical documentaries of this generation.
</P>
<P>
   Airing on four consecutive nights next week on PBS, ``Africans
in America'' is a troubling story of a nation dedicated to
principles of personal liberty yet built on the most egregious
violations of those principles.
</P>
<P>
   In part one Monday, ``The Terrible Transformation'' tells of
``the largest forced migration in recorded history,'' which began
innocently enough with the unplanned arrival of 20 Africans at
Jamestown, Va., aboard a mystery ship in 1619. The crew of the ship
had pirated the Africans from a Spanish vessel and sold them to
Virginia colonists in exchange for food.
</P>
<P>
   Those first African Americans were not slaves. They might have
become indentured servants, the same as white Europeans who signed
agreements with their Virginia employers in exchange for passage to
the New World and a chance to start out on their own at the
termination of their service contracts. Records show that some
black servants, upon satisfying the terms of their indenture,
became prominent landowners, living in harmony alongside their
white neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1640, however, when three servants ran away from a Virginia
plantation, the climate began to change. Upon their capture, two of
the servants, both white Europeans, were indentured for an
additional year. The third, an African named John Punch, was
sentenced to serve ``his master'' for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Massachusetts became the first American colony to
make slavery legal. One century after that, 31 slaves were either
burned at the stake or hanged in New York City amid rising fears of
an insurrection by slaves.
</P>
<P>
   How had colonial America gone from a nation that was essentially
color blind to one that subjugated an entire race?
</P>
<P>
   It was the economy. As American planters sought to expand, first
in the production of tobacco, and eventually in cotton and rice,
they needed cheap _ or better yet, free _ labor. Thomas Jefferson,
author of ``all men are created equal,'' admitted that slaveholders
would someday have to pay for their transgressions. His shame,
though, was not sufficient to free the slaves who kept him and his
family comfortable at Monticello.
</P>
<P>
   Parts two, three and four are ``Revolution'' (1750-1805),
``Brotherly Love'' (1776-1834) and ``Judgment Day'' (1831-1861).
With rich narration by Angela Bassett and the voices of such actors
as Avery Brooks, Andre Braugher, William Hurt and Carl Lumbly
bringing words of the era to life, each installment is an
invaluable guide to what ``Africans in America'' calls ``America's
journey through slavery.''
</P>
<P>

history of slavery in America. Narrated by Angela Bassett. Monday

THERE'S REALITY, AND THEN THERE'S HOLLYWOOD'S CONCEPTION
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The show lasted just four episodes. Not even
Southie chic could rescue ``Costello,'' with a concept too tiny and
a kitchen too big. This sitcom family chowed down in something like
the hoop court at the South Boston Boys and Girls Club or the
parade ground at Castle Island.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox network, under the spiritual guidance of Rupert Murdoch,
is the Lower End of programming, seldom fussy about authenticity or
amiability. Many new programs hope to resurrect working-class
nostalgia. Ralph Kramden begat Archie Bunker, who begat Roseanne,
whose heirlooms are high ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Reality has bleached that blue collar into cluelessness. The
scripts for the latest washout placed the beguiling heroine, Sue
Costello, in impossible situations. She pesters Pop for a ride to
City Point to visit her therapist. A ride? To City Point? To see a
therapist? Another character threatens Sue with trouble ``at the
DMV.'' In Massachusetts, it's the Registry of Motor Vehicles, if
the California writers had checked.
</P>
<P>
   South Boston's kitchens are small, but its heart is big.
Overall, the show was not flattering to that patch of heaven, zip
code 02127. Southie must be content with the afterglow of ``Good
Will Hunting,'' even as Greater Boston remains a giant sound stage
for movies and television.
</P>
<P>
   Some television touches stretch credulity, making area code 617
a fantasy island of verisimilitude. Why does the scruffy lead
lawyer in ``The Practice'' boycott Southie's biggest employer? Some
jurors might work for Gillette. Ally McBeal's confusion may be
related to geography. Her office is on Beacon Street,near the State
House, but her view is of Faneuil Hall. In Hollywood, one
gold-domed pile of bricks is as good as another.
</P>
<P>
   Verisimilitude can affect a city's reputation. Here in San
Francisco, the city was becoming cloyingly precious in the 1970s
before Clint Eastwood made those gritty ``Dirty Harry'' movies. On
television, Karl Malden and Michael Douglas rode the squad cars and
public sympathy for police, making cops look good in ``The Streets
of San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   The city of Baltimore is the real star of ``Homicide: Life on
the Street,'' but authenticity isn't everything. In the latest
police show filmed here, ``Nash Bridges,'' the scenery is stunning,
but the plots and characters are preposterous. ``Dharma and Greg''
is filmed in a studio, but the characters evoke everyday life in
Haight-Ashbury and Nob Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In the final episode of ``Costello,'' Sue meets a student at
Harvard Dental School. Harvard has no dental school, but Tufts
does. Tufts plays a starring role in an ABC comedy about two guys,
a pizza, and unfunny dialogue. In one wildly improbable plot turn,
someone is scalping tickets to a Tufts homecoming game. The noble
Jumbos should have it so good. Also, the team seems to be playing
UCLA in a stadium bigger than Sue Costello's kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   In verisimilitude, size matters. Those bush pilots in ``Wings''
lived in houses on Nantucket that Fortune 500 tycoons couldn't
afford.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the television characters in ersatz Hub settings affect
a post-Seinfeldian edge that favors nasty over zany. It's witless
class warfare, making the gang at ``Cheers'' seem as distant and
quaint as characters in a Henry James novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheers'' took place in Ward Five, but recent movies still
celebrate the less glamorous precincts of Boston. ``Next Stop,
Wonderland'' asks the question: Will the suspicious woman from the
South End finally meet the earnest fellow from Eastie? ``Monument
Ave.'' wonders whether Charlestown is still Charlestown and whether
Townies are still Townies.
</P>
<P>
   Boston is cinematic hot property, good news for the many guys I
know who seldom travel beyond Neponset Circle. Hollywood is now on
a talent hunt in what Jack Kennedy called ``a city where they
pronounce the words the way they are spelled.'' These barstool
Barry-mores could soon be dialect coaches. Is America a great
country or what?

CATHOLIC SCHOLARS CALL POPE'S MESSAGE A TIMELY CRITIQUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also POPE-ANNIVERSARY) 
(js) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Vatican released Pope John Paul II's latest encyclical
on Thursday, it published a document by a trained philosopher who
explores and amplifies a historic church position that faith and
reason cannot be separated. He does so in a style that some Roman
Catholic scholars say might even make it a useful text for
undergraduate courses.
</P>
<P>
   But scholars said the encyclical, ``Fides et Ratio'' (``Faith
and Reason''), which was addressed to the bishops, should not be
read simply as a document of interest primarily to them and
students, but one that comes with a message for a worldwide,
growing church. The encyclical contains a critique of past
intellectual trends and a look ahead.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II examines and rejects various philosophical trends
that he said have abandoned the search for truth. And noting that
Christianity is about to enter its third millennium, the pope
declares the church as reason's defender against intellectuals who
have given up on discovering absolute truth.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, said the Rev. Avery Dulles, professor of religion and
society at Fordham University, is ``saying that the church has a
duty to defend human reason and, paradoxically, people outside the
church don't seem to be doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Philosophy is the pope's academic specialty. As a priest in
Poland, the Rev. Karol Wojtyla received his doctorate in the
subject from Jagiellonian University in Poland in 1960. But his
encyclical proclaims anew ideas with a long history in Catholic
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a timely re-statement of a particular position that goes
back to the 13th century and was re-emphasized in the 19th century,
but particularly needs to be said today,'' Dulles said. ``I think
it comes from his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The 150-page document contains some specialized language in its
discussion of trends in philosophy. But some sections are written
in a style accessible to a broader audience. In its earliest
chapters, for example, the pope says that some questions are
universal, such as ``Who am I?'' and ``Does life have a meaning?''
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, he strikes at a resonant chord with contemporary
culture, where much public discussion has focused on the need to
re-establish a sense of community and to discover shared social
values.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very upbeat in its overall tone,'' said the Rev. Robert
Sokolowski, who teaches philosophy at Catholic University of
America, in Washington, in an assessment echoed by others who have
read the encyclical. ``It's kind of an exhortation to be confident
in the discoveries of reason.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It's also very important that he sees religion and
faith as not destroying reason. You don't have to abandon your
intellect when you believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars who read the encyclical said that they could
imagine it having a classroom use. ``I teach a course in philosophy
of religion,'' said the Rev. Brian Shanley, who teaches philosophy
at Catholic University. ``This is the kind of document that I might
want the students to look at to reiterate the classical line.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Shanley also saw a wider application for the encyclical, which
contains sections stating that the faith's essentials remain
constant regardless of the surrounding culture, no matter what part
of the world the church is in. ``The word of God is not addressed
to any one people or to any one period of history,'' the pope
writes. ``Similarly, dogmatic statements, while reflecting at times
the culture of the period in which they were defined, formulate an
unchanging and ultimate truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The encyclical mounts a defense of the church's ability to
proclaim its faith against ``post-modern'' philosophical
tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When philosophy is saying all truth claims are relative,''
Shanley said, then the challenge the church faces is that it
becomes more difficult to teach that all believers should be bound
by the decisions of church councils that took place in past
centuries in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   One of most important trends of John Paul II's 20-year reign has
been a geographic shift of the world's Catholic population toward
the Southern Hemisphere. Between 1976 and 1995, Catholics in Africa
and Asia together grew from 14 percent of the church's members to
20 percent, according to church statistics. By contrast, the
Catholic population of Europe has been largely stable.

SHOULD CLINTON CAMPAIGN FOR THOSE WHO WILL SIT IN JUDGMENT?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's President Clinton's modus operandi as a
prodigious fund-raiser _ using his appeal to raise big bucks for
Democratic allies, including those on Capitol Hill, in the final
push before an election.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, shadowed by impeachment clouds, there is concern
that Clinton's fund-raising on behalf of Senate candidates is
inappropriate and should cease because the full Senate would sit in
judgment of the president if he is impeached by the House.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and congressional watchdog groups are warning that
with a constitutional process now in play, such fund-raising
activities have the appearance of a conflict of interest,
particularly when support from Democrats is so crucial to whether
Clinton stays in office.
</P>
<P>
   The concern surfaced earlier this week when the president went
to New York and raised $1.1 million for Representative Charles E.
Schumer, a Senate candidate and member of the House Judiciary
Committee. Clinton also raised eyebrows when he made a reference to
Schumer as ``voting right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The president owes it to the public not to do anything at all,
particularly in the case of the Senate, that creates the appearance
of witness tampering or jury tampering,'' said Gary Ruskin,
director of the Congressional Accountability Project, a
congressional reform group tied to consumer advocate Ralph Nader.
``Whether or not it's an actual conflict is one thing, but the
appearance is bad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But is it reasonable to expect Clinton to sit on his hands and
not help elect members of his own party, including Senate
candidates? And is it reasonable to expect those who benefit from
his financial support to not be influenced?
</P>
<P>
   Friday, after a Rose Garden ceremony celebrating the budget
deal, Clinton flew to Chicago for a $2,500-a-plate luncheon to help
Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, who is locked in an tough battle to
retain her seat.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, it's Senator Barbara Boxer's turn. The president is
scheduled to travel to California Tuesday _ for the second time in
three weeks _ to help fatten her campaign coffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The support of every Democratic senator is utterly essential
to Bill Clinton,'' said Charles Lewis, executive director of the
Center for Public Integrity. ``Their judgment has to somehow remain
objective even though he may have saved their neck financially in
terms of the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis added: ``This is particularly bizarre and wild, and an
almost unprecedented historic occurence that we are stumbling into
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Grossman, a Massachusetts native and chairman of the
Democratic National Committee, said, ``I have no doubt that any
Democratic member of the Senate will exercise his or her
responsibility in an entirely appropriate and dignified way.''
</P>
<P>
   The potential conflict for Clinton did not present itself, most
analysts agree, until last month, when independent counsel Kenneth
W. Starr sent his report to Congress outlining possible impeachable
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Before then, Clinton had attended fund-raisers that benefited
some members of the House Judiciary Committee, which will conduct
an impeachment inquiry starting next month, including an August
event that raised $300,000 for California Representative Maxine
Waters.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, White House and Democratic Party officials scoffed at
the notion that Clinton's fund-raising for Senate Democrats is
improper and said the pace has not increased since Starr issued his
report.
</P>
<P>
   They compared Clinton's situation to House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, saying Gingrich did not refrain from campaigning for
fellow Republicans when he was under an ethics investigation by the
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the speaker isn't the subject of an impeachment inquiry,''
retorted Patricia Harrison, who co-chairs the Republican National
Committee. She said the White House and its allies were comparing
``apples to dump trucks.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Barry Toiv said that using Harrison's
logic, Clinton would not be able to campaign for any member of
Congress ``since at some point they could all conceivably have to
sit in judgment of him. Frankly, that's exactly what the
Republicans would like, but there is no reason for him not to and
he will continue to campaign for Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Democrats who benefit from Clinton's
fund-raisers would be unlikely to vote for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Cathie Levine, Schumer's press secretary, said Schumer does not
think the allegations against Clinton are worthy of impeachment.
``Chuck has made it very clear that he believes what the president
did was wrong, and while it warrants punishment, it does not rise
to the level of impeachment,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton has raised money for Schumer, his Republican
opponent, Senator Alfonse D'Amato, ``went down to Atlanta and
raised money from Newt Gingrich,'' Levine said.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman described the criticism of Clinton as ``political
gamesmanship. They are attempting to obscure the fact that ... the
Republican Party is adrift and without an agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   But others cited the fund-raising as part of Senator Robert
Byrd's warning to Clinton. The veteran Democrat from West Virginia
took to the Senate floor last week to tell the White House, ``don't
tamper with this jury,'' after Clinton aides tried to get 34
signatures from senators to prejudge a House impeachment inquiry as
moot.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case of potential jury tampering and votes for
sale,'' said the GOP's Harrison. ``We are part of a very serious
initiative here. We are Americans first, not Democrats and
Republicans, and the Constitution trumps all of this.''

MIDDLE EAST LEADERS SPEND A DAY TALKING PEACE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Wearing casual clothes and listening to
exhortations from US mediators, Israeli and Palestinian leaders
entered their first full day of peace talks in a Maryland retreat
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While four working groups discussed security and other issues,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat sat with an interpreter on a deck overlooking the
bank of the Wye River for about an hour. They then joined Secretary
of State Madeleine K. Albright for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin described a day full
of meetings, phone calls, and ``cross-pollination.'' But he refused
to talk about the progress of the talks, which are expected to
conclude tomorrow or Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the pace of the work, the seriousness of the
work, the pragmatism that the delegations are bringing to bear, the
constructive approach, is there,'' Rubin said. ``Whether that will
be enough is still an open question.''
</P>
<P>
   A Palestinian indicated to reporters that Clinton had given the
negotators a firm deadline of Tuesday to come up with a plan for an
Israeli withdrawal from 13 percent more of the West Bank.
Otherwise, the US government will abandon its role as mediator, the
aide said.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, Albright has hinted that Washington is
tiring of negotiating without solid results. Asked about an exact
deadline, Rubin said. ``I never heard anyone suggesting such a
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Many experts who have talked to both delegations expect some
agreement about a pullout to be reached by the end of the weekend,
although thorny issues about Palestinians' rights to travel and
plans for a Palestinian airport are still being discussed. Even
tougher matters, such as the boundaries of Jerusalem and water
rights, await other rounds of talks.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Arab-language newspapers and television stations
have given conflicting accounts of the progress of talks leading up
to the summit and during the initial conversations Thursday at the
White House and the Wye plantation. Several experts said top CIA
officials are present to talk with Palestinians about
anti-terrorist measures demanded by the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Both delegations also have lawyers to discuss the different
phases of the next West Bank withdrawal, which is expected to take
several months.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made a political appearance in Chicago but talked to
Albright on route. He is expected at the Wye River retreat today
for informal discussions with both sides. Albright also spoke with
Jordan's King Hussein, who is serving as a long-distance
mediator-emeritus from a cancer clinic in Rochester, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   The king met Friday with Israel's foreign minister, Ariel
Sharon, who was on his way to the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai also is expected this
weekend. A spokesman told Reuters that Mordechai had remained in
Israel during the week because of threats of ``Hamas terrorist
attacks aimed at undermining the negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The talks halted at sundown in honor of the Jewish Sabbath.
Netanyahu dined with his advisers while the Americans and
Palestinians gathered for a dinner. Because the Sabbath does not
end till sundown tonight, the Americans cautioned that very little
progress is likely today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect people to talk to each other, but as far as
formal work or note-taking or formal travel, I wouldn't expect
that, but we'll have to see,'' Rubin said.

WHY DOES CAROL MOSELEY-BRAUN LOOK LIKE A LOSER?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVANSTON, Ill. _ In a charming Victorian parlor on a broad,
tree-lined boulevard _ the suburban equivalent of a legendary
Chicago smoke-filled room _ the new Democratic kingmakers sipped
bottled water and wondered how things had gone so terribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Less than three weeks before the election, US Senator Carol
Moseley-Braun, the political nobody these affluent, activist women
of Evanston helped turn into a historic somebody six years ago,
looks like a loser on Nov. 3. Though leading Democrats are mounting
a rescue operation _ Hillary Rodham Clinton will campaign with her
today, President Clinton was at her side Friday _ she trails her
Republican opponent, state Senator Peter Fitzgerald, by 13 points
in the latest Chicago Tribune poll.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, this parlor was full of promise and high hopes
for Moseley-Braun, the nation's first black woman senator. Today,
her backers are frustrated at Moseley-Braun's many missteps and
bitter that the soccer moms and stalwart Democratic men who elected
her aren't inclined to give her a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``God help a woman candidate who strays,'' said Joan Levin, who
was in Moseley-Braun's law school class at the University of
Chicago. ``Everybody makes mistakes, but somehow people hold women
officials to a higher standard and have expectations for them that
they don't have for men.''
</P>
<P>
   If 1992 was the Year of the Woman, when a record number of
female candidates soared into office, 1998 looks like the Year of
the Endangered Woman. First-term women senators are fighting for
survival in California and Washington state, but neither seems as
desperate as Moseley-Braun, who in a statewide TV ad this week
admitted to Illinois voters that she had let her backers down.
</P>
<P>
   ``My tenure hasn't been without rocks and blemishes. I've
stumbled and made mistakes,'' Moseley-Braun told her friends last
weekend in Evanston. ``But I've kept the faith, and I've worked
hard. It's a big job, and bigger when you look like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics don't buy the argument that Moseley-Braun, 51, is
disadvantaged by her race or gender. This contest, they say, is a
referendum on the senator's character and integrity, qualities that
are magnified this year by President Clinton's affair with Monica
S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   John McGovern, spokesman for Fitzgerald, points out that
Moseley-Braun has been investigated for several scandals of her
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1992, a lot of women voters, particularly Republican women,
were intrigued by the symbolism of Moseley-Braun's candidacy, but
now that they have learned all about the scandal and the
controversy, they are the first to desert her, based on ethics
alone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   First there was the $28,000 inheritance she and her siblings
divided before being forced to reimburse Medicaid for their
mother's nursing-home bills. Next came a secret trip _ the first of
seven _ to Nigeria, where Moseley-Braun met with General Sani
Abacha, the late dictator despised by human-rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   There were sexual harassment allegations made against Kgosie
Matthews, her former fiance and 1992 campaign manager. And both the
Federal Election Commission and the Internal Revenue Service
investigated the senator and Matthews for allegedly spending
campaign funds on clothes, jewelry, and personal travel. No formal
charges were brought in those cases.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Moseley-Braun created a stir when she lost her
cool before the cameras and blasted conservative commentator George
Will for writing what she believed was a racist column. She
referred to herself with a racial slur and suggested Will could be
a Ku Klux Klansman. ``Will can just take his hood and go back to
wherever he came from,'' she said. Moseley-Braun had to retract her
words and apologize to Will.
</P>
<P>
   ``She simply has blown it with the dumb things she does,'' said
Kenneth Janda, a professor of political science at Northwestern
University in Evanston. ``She had an opportunity for a long career
in Washington but instead showed by her behavior that she was not a
very able individual and that she is out of her league.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Lehner, an Evanston homemaker and mother of three, voted
for Moseley-Braun in 1992 but says she is unlikely to support her
again. ``Why should I, when she hasn't done much in six years?''
Lehner asked. ``I'd like to vote for `none of the above.'''
</P>
<P>
   Moseley-Braun says she has ``produced and been accountable.'' In
her first term she has championed affirmative action, abortion
rights, and gun control, supported free-trade treaties, farm
relief, and a balanced budget, and sponsored legislation to rebuild
schools and mandate pension equity for women.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the refrain in Illinois is that Moseley-Braun was an
``accidental senator.'' A former state legislator and a protege of
former Chicago Mayor Harold Washington, Moseley-Braun was recruited
in 1992 by women outraged over Supreme Court Justice Clarence
Thomas's confirmation hearings. She was the only Democrat left
standing in a nasty, three-way primary fight that ousted incumbent
Senator Alan Dixon, and she easily beat a weak GOP candidate to win
the seat.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Alexis of Evanston, a lawyer who coaxed Moseley-Braun into
the 1992 race and helped her raise money, said state Democratic
leaders _ mostly male and white _ are still chafing over Dixon's
defeat and have done little to bolster Moseley-Braun. ``They're
trying to teach us a lesson about what happens when women and
African-Americans get too uppity,'' she said. ``I hope they wake up
before it's too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Time is running out. Odds now are on a victory by Republican
Fitzgerald, a 37-year-old multimillionaire with a degree in the
classics from Dartmouth College. His voting record is so
conservative that party elders recruited the state comptroller, a
centrist woman, to run against him in the March primary.
</P>
<P>
   In the state Senate, Fitzgerald opposed any new taxes and urged
using the budget surplus to cut taxes instead. He is against
abortion except to save the life of the mother and opposes
homosexuals in the military. He supports school vouchers, and he
recently dropped his opposition to legislation barring people from
carrying concealed handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Though he doesn't fit the progressive profile of past Illinois
senators, Fitzgerald is far ahead in the polls. According to the
Tribune poll published Sunday, Fitzgerald leads Moseley-Braun 49 to
36 percent among all voters, 46 to 35 percent among women, and 58
to 28 percent among suburban white women. In 1992, the gender gap
was reversed; Moseley-Braun led her GOP opponent by 16 points among
women voters. (The latest poll, taken Oct. 3-6, has a margin of
error of 3 points.)
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Fitzgerald is so popular. Only one-third of the
voters have a favorable impression of him, and half don't agree
with his positions on gun control and abortion. But he isn't the
issue. Almost half the electorate has an unfavorable impression of
Moseley-Braun, and only 19 percent believe she is more trustworthy
than her opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley-Braun's high negatives are being reinforced by
Fitzgerald's $400,000 a week in television advertising. Fitzgerald,
who spent $7 million of his own money to win the primary, has been
dubbed the ``stealth candidate'' by the Chicago media because he
makes few public appearances around the city and provides only rare
opportunities for interviews, debates, or speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Celinda Lake, Moseley-Braun's pollster, says she believes the
race is tighter than polls indicate and will narrow more as the
senator pounds her opponent's politics and woos women on issues
they care about, particularly education, health care, and Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the state party is pumping money into Moseley-Braun
ads on television, and today the National Organization for Women
and other liberal interest groups are to launch a ``Women's Votes
Count Campaign'' aimed at increasing turnout in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Democrat Ann Richards, the tart-tongued former
governor of Texas, joined Moseley-Braun for the Evanston meeting.
She urged the women to open their wallets so the senator could
``compete with this rich yahoo on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not since Adam said `Eve made me do it' has a man blamed a
woman for so much that's gone wrong,'' Richards said. ``I say
voters should get over it, move on, and reelect Carol
Moseley-Braun.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CASPER, Wyo. _ Matthew Wayne Shepard, the gay student who was
beaten in the dead of night, tied to a fence and left to die alone,
was mourned at his funeral Friday by 1,000 people, including many
who had never met him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt believed that if he had made one person's life better, he
had succeeded,'' his cousin, the Rev. Anne Kitch, said in a homily
that was carried beyond the packed pews of St. Mark's Episcopal
Church, through a filled parish hall, across the street to a packed
Presbyterian church and across Casper on an AM radio station.
``Judging from the world's response,'' she said, ``Matt will have
made a difference in the lives of thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   As the first snowstorm of the fall blanketed Casper, fresh
flowers filled the red brick church here where Shepard had been
baptized as a teen-ager and where he once wore the white robes of
an Episcopal acolyte.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an image that comes to mind when I reflect on Matt on
that wooden cross rail fence,'' said the Rev. Royce Brown, the
pastor of St. Mark's, in a eulogy. ``I replace that image with that
of another man hung upon a cross. When I concentrate on that man, I
can release the bitterness inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard, a 21-year-old freshman at the University of Wyoming,
had dreamed of working one day for human rights. In death, he has
become a national catalyst for a new drive to guarantee for gay
people the right to physical safety.
</P>
<P>
   His death hit a nerve in the nation this week, eliciting dozens
of candlelight vigils and rallies for tolerance, several statements
of sadness from President Clinton, and a congressional resolution.
Thursday, the House of Representatives passed by voice vote a
resolution that condemned Shepard's killing as ``outrageous'' and
that urged each member of Congress and every U.S. citizen ``to
denounce this outrageous murder of another human being.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the largest rallies, about 1,000 people, including
members of Congress of both parties, gathered on the steps of the
Capitol in Washington to condemn the Shepherd's killing and to urge
passage of a federal bill that would add extra penalties to crimes
motivated by a victim's sexual orientation, gender or disability.
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt urged passage of the bill,
leading the crowd in a chant of ``Now! Now! Now.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We will never forget the love that the world has shared with
this kind, loving son,'' said Shepherd's father, Dennis, his
father, outside Casper City Hall, as his mother, Judy, stood by,
weeping. He said the family was ``touched beyond measure'' by ``the
thousands of e-mail comments, Web-site messages, phone calls and
cards offering help, consolation, sympathy and support.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the funeral, about a dozen protesters, largely from
Kansas and Texas, waved signs with anti-homosexual messages. But
mourners stood in front of them, singing ``Amazing Grace'' and
holding umbrellas to block the sight of the spectacle from friends
and family members entering the church.
</P>
<P>
   On hearing of the protest, Laramie's City Council held an
emergency meeting Thursday night and unanimously passed an
ordinance banning protests during funerals.
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming Gov. Jim Geringer had warned in advance that anti-gay
protesters were ``just flat not welcome.'' The governor, a
Republican, added, ``What we don't need is a bunch of wingnuts
coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard was born in Casper and attended elementary school,
junior high and several years of high school and college here. With
flags at Casper's public schools flying at half-staff Friday, many
mourners were his old classmates. Others traveled here, one driving
from as far away as New Jersey, out of a sense of solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a pit in my heart and my stomach since I heard
this,'' said Steve Pietrangelo, who drove 300 miles to wait three
hours in cold rain and snow to attend the funeral of a man he never
met. ``I just wanted to pay my respects to him and his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Touching people of all walks of life, Shepard's murder has
elicited calls for tolerance of homosexuals from unexpected
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Wyoming this fall, football players will
wear yellow and green stickers on their helmets in memory of
Shepard. Organizers said that yellow signifies tolerance and green
symbolizes peace. In Casper, a conservative city of 51,000, located
in the heart of Wyoming's oil belt, tolerance has become the
watchword.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prejudice against homosexuals is just as redneck as anti-black
bias,'` The Casper Star-Tribune, Wyoming's largest newspaper, wrote
in its main editorial on Sunday. ``Violence against our homosexual
friends and neighbors has created a most un-American climate of
fear in Wyoming and the rest of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Jason Marsden, the newspaper's political reporter, wrote
lovingly that, ``Matthew Shepard is still my friend, and not just
because we are both members of the loose-knit community of gay
people striving to make our way in this sometimes hostile place
called Wyoming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt was very short and hard to hug,'' Marsden recalled of the
young man who had grown up in Casper. ``But it was worth trying,
because he'd hug you with everything in his little, fragile
frame.''
</P>
<P>
   In a week of spiritual reflection, Aaron Kreifels, the
University of Wyoming freshman who found his battered classmate
Oct. 7, attributed the chance discovery to ``God's plan.''
</P>
<P>
   On that afternoon, Kreifels, an 18-year-old architectural
engineering student, had nearly completed a rigorous six-mile ride
on a mountain bike up and down Cactus Canyon, in public lands east
of Laramie.
</P>
<P>
   Kreifels recalled in an interview Thursday that his only mishap
of the ride, ``I hit this big limestone rock and did one over the
handlebars.''
</P>
<P>
   Dusting himself off and looking around in the fading light of
the day, Kreifels recalled, ``I noticed something out of my eye
that looked like a scarecrow. I walked around the fence, and as I
got closer, I noticed the hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard, his hands bound behind his back with a nylon cord and
tied to a fence post, was lying on the ground, face up,
unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I wonder why I found him alive, if he was going to
die,'' Kreifels reflected, before traveling to spend this weekend
at home with his parents in Grand Island, Neb. ``But I guess God
wanted his parents to be with him.''

CRUSADER FOR ANIMALS DIDN'T SHY AWAY FROM FIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was known to many as the archly hilarious author of ``The
Proper Bostonians,'' and to many more as an acerbic writer and
social commentator for the ``Today'' show, ``CBS Morning News,''
the Saturday Review, TV Guide, and Parade magazine.
</P>
<P>
   To those closest to him, he was a charming, kind friend. But to
animal lovers, Cleveland Amory, who died in his sleep at 81 in his
New York apartment Wednesday night, will be remembered best as the
tireless if curmudgeonly crusader for creatures in need.
</P>
<P>
   With his formidable intellect and wit, Amory was like a force of
nature in any cause he took on. And he was never afraid to pick a
fight. In his early years, the Harvard-educated social historian
became known as a traitor to his class with his anthropological hit
on proper Bostonians. Published in 1947, the book is now in its
29th printing. Even the elite eventually had to laugh at his
scorchingly accurate portraits.
</P>
<P>
   He had the ability to make his enemies smile (sort of). And
enemies he made. Throughout his life, he battled any force that
harmed animals.
</P>
<P>
   As a young man writing for the Arizona Daily Star, he was sent
to Nogales, Mexico, to cover a festival that included a bullfight.
Amory often said that he had never witnessed anything as despicable
as the treatment of the bull. In an interview with me in 1997, he
said that the animal had been blinded and his horns shortened. ``A
cross goose could have killed him,'' Amory said, growing angry even
then at the memory.
</P>
<P>
   While the crowd was focused on cheering the matador, Amory, in a
rage, made his way down to the ring, carrying a rain-sodden cushion
from the stands. ``Then I made my prayers to the Almighty. He
hadn't listened to me about the Red Sox,'' Amory said, but he asked
for divine guidance anyway, then hurled the heavy pad at the
smiling matador. It hit him hard in the neck. ``I've had a lot of
great feelings in my life,'' Amory whispered, as an angelic look
passed over his face, ``but this was the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides assaulting matadors, Amory was proud to have protested,
exposed, and sued people, institutions, and government agencies
(including the powerful federal Bureau of Land Management, which he
called ``one of the most despicable agencies in the entire history
of the federal government'').
</P>
<P>
   For the past 30 years, he served, without pay, as president of
the Fund for Animals, a nonprofit animal welfare organization.
Despite his deteriorating health, he insisted on working at the
fund's Manhattan offices every day _ making his way there with the
aid of two canes.
</P>
<P>
   Though often in pain, Amory maintained his dignity and wit. He
was at once both frail and imposing _ a big man with a rakish shock
of gray hair.
</P>
<P>
   Amory begrudgingly revealed his sweet side in three nationally
best-selling cat books: ``The Cat Who Came for Christmas,'' ``The
Cat and the Curmudgeon,'' and ``The Best Cat Ever,'' all centered
on his dear companion, Polar Bear, a big white cat as set in his
ways as his owner.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Amory wrote ``Ranch of Dreams,'' the story of
Black Beauty Ranch, an animal sanctuary he created in Texas.
Through the ranch, he was able to rescue 5,000 burros slated for
slaughter on government land, 4,000 goats in the way of the US Navy
on San Clemente Island, a chimpanzee from a biomedical lab, and
abused elephants and horses.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was born in Nahant to an old New England family, the
genealogical connection that made Amory proudest was his
great-uncle, George Thorndike Angell, founder of the Massachusetts
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the man
responsible for introducing the classic book ``Black Beauty'' to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Sewell's novel about a horse's adventures so profoundly
affected young ``Clippie'' Amory that he dedicated his life to
protecting animals, and he named his sanctuary after it.
</P>
<P>
   Amory's ashes will be buried at the sanctuary, next to the
remains of his beloved Polar Bear. Inscribed nearby, at the gates
of the sanctuary, are some words from ``Black Beauty'' that could
serve as an epitaph: ``I have nothing to fear, and here my story
ends. My troubles are over, and I am home.''

BUDGET PACT INCLUDES PLAN TO CURB CHILD ACCESS TO CYBERPORN 
</HEADLINE>
  (with CONGRESS-SPEND, CONGRESS-CLINTON) 
(bl) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tucked into the $1.7 trillion budget agreement is a
new measure that would restrict children's access to pornography on
the Internet. The measure was sponsored by Republicans who said
they had written it to overcome free-speech objections that the
Supreme Court used to overturn a previous measure.
</P>
<P>
   But even before Congress passes the new budget, the same groups
that defeated the last effort are vowing to sue once again.
</P>
<P>
   The old act tried to regulate access by children to ``indecent''
or ``patently offensive'' pornographic material. Last year, the
Supreme Court ruled that an unconstitutional violation of the First
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The new version, called the Child Online Privacy Act, changes
the standard, saying that Internet merchants and others will be in
violation only if they give children access to material that is
``harmful to minors.'' (Internet service providers are exempt from
liability if they do not produce the offending material).
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Peterson, spokeswoman for Rep. Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, who
is a primary sponsor of the proposal, said her office had
established that the new language was backed by numerous court
decisions providing a clear and rigorous standard for violation.
</P>
<P>
   The new act, Oxley said in a floor statement early this month,
``employs the constitutionally tested harmful-to-minors standard
recognized and upheld in federal courts for more than 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   In a general sense, that standard refers to material that is
specifically created for prurient interests, that graphically
depicts lewd or sexual behavior, and that holds no social, artistic
or scientific value.
</P>
<P>
   But Ann Beeson, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union,
which led the last court fight, said ``this one has the same flaws
as the last one,'' the Communications Decency Act of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will definitely sue.'' Ms. Beeson said, adding that the
ACLUand a dozen allied groups would file their suit some time next
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under this law,'' she said, ``I think even The New York Times
would be in violation, by posting the Starr report on its Web
site.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Peterson called that ``bogus,'' and added that ``the Starr
report does not even approach the harmful-to-minors standard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration opposes inclusion of the proposal in
the budget act, but allowed it to slip past on the assumption that
the courts would overturn it, an administration official said. The
Justice Department sent a letter to Congress this week, saying the
department believed that the new proposal would run afoul of the
same First Amendment concerns that ensnared the the Communications
Decency Act.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beeson said the ACLU suit would be joined by ``a diverse
range of online speakers representing news organizations, gay and
lesbian groups, artists, booksellers and online video dealers,''
among others, including any Web sites that distributed the Starr
report.
</P>
<P>
   Just like the Communications Decency Act, she added, ``this bill
will once again criminalize socially valuable adult speech and
reduce the Internet to what is considered suitable for a
6-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   Electronic Frontier Foundation president Barry Steinhardt plans
to join the suit and said: ``It is the height of irony that the
same Congress that plastered the salacious Starr report all over
the Internet now passes a plainly unconstitutional law to suppress
a vaguely defined category of `harmful' material. You would think
Congress would have learned that `harmfulness' is in the eye of the
beholder.''
</P>
<P>
   New York Times spokeswoman Nancy Nielsen said The Times and
other major news organizations had been asked to join in the last
suit and declined. ``We haven't followed the new one closely,'' she
added, ``but we're looking at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Peterson said the bill would require Internet pornographers
to positively verify that a visitor to a site was an adult. One
means of verification would be to require a credit card for a site
that charges for access. ``That's already being done,'' she said.
Another means might be the use of digital signatures.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Oxley noted, ``much of the Internet is awash in
smut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are literally thousands of Web sites dedicated to every
manner of perversion and brutality,'' he said. ``A child may
innocently search for key words like `doll house,' `toys' or `pets'
and be led to numerous explicit sites.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, using the phrase ``doll house'' in an Internet search
engine brings up 19 entries on the first screen, including sites on
doll house collections, doll house furniture _ as well as doll
house escort services and the ``doll house strip joint.'' Clicking
on any of the latter sites brings up pornographic images that are
used to entice visitors to join.

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Has the stock market bear lumbered back into its
cave? That is the way it looked this week as stocks roared
following the Federal Reserve Board's surprise rate cut on
Thursday. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the week up 6.5
percent at 8,416.76.
</P>
<P>
   One reason investors seem to have high hopes for stocks is that
they have already suffered a major mauling in their portfolios.
With the average New York Stock Exchange stock down 37.1 percent
from its peak and the average Nasdaq stock down 50.5 percent,
investors can be forgiven for hoping the worst is over now.
</P>
<P>
   Only trouble is, while the Dow and the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index are down about 10 percent and 11 percent,
respectively, from their July highs, they remain high on an
earnings-valuation basis. For example, the S&AMP;P carries a
price-to-earnings ratio of more than 25.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks also look rich over all when judged against the size of
the national economy. At the market's peak earlier this year, the
value of publicly traded stocks totaled some $11.7 trillion, more
than 1.3 times the nation's gross domestic product. Recently,
equities were valued at around 1.1 times GDP Typically, according
to Kenneth C. Grainger, an independent market strategist in New
York and Montreal, stocks are valued at a discount to GDP, ranging
between 35 percent and 82 percent of output.
</P>
<P>
   When equities exceed those levels, red flags fly. At the end of
1989, for instance, as Japanese stocks neared 39,000, the Nikkei
index of 225 stocks was valued at about 1.3 times Japan's GDP. An
economy that is slowing, as is the case here, cannot sustain those
kinds of valuations for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the uneven quality to the now three-month downturn in
stocks remains a puzzle. While investors who own
small-capitalization stocks have been hammered, those who are in
S&AMP;P index funds are sitting relatively pretty, up about 9 percent
on the year.
</P>
<P>
   What does this inequity in returns mean for the future of the
overall market? Some investors have been hoping the blood bath in
individual stocks has been so bad that the big-capitalization stock
indexes will not suffer a bigger drop from their peaks than they
have already seen. Those still holding beaten-down stocks also
wonder how they will fare if the indexes do take a dive. Surely
these stocks are so far down, investors hope, that they could not
decline further?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, history does not bear out either theory. John L.
Manley Jr., equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, went back to
1969 and examined how individual stocks and indexes performed in
downturns.
</P>
<P>
   What did he find? Sharp declines by a large number of stocks do
not preclude bear markets. Rather, they have inevitably preceded
them. For example, in May 1969 a bear market began that took the
S&AMP;P 500 down 29.7 percent. But in the 12 months before that overall
drop, the average stock fell 18.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Manley's research also found that even when a stock is down
precipitously while overall indexes remain aloft, the stock can
fall further when the indexes get clipped. ``In four of the five
cases studied,'' he reported, ``the bad stocks before a bear market
were the bad stocks during the bear market.''
</P>
<P>
   What does all this mean for equity investors today? While Manley
believes that the Fed's rate cut will support the market for
awhile, the key to any significant uptrend in stocks will be good
news coming out of Asia and Latin America. ``Until they appear to
be bottoming, which we don't have yet, as good as the rate cut is,
it's still an ephemeral solution,'' he said.

TALK SHOW HOST QUITS AND THERE ARE LOTS OF REASONS WHY

<P>
   PAHRUMP, Nev. _ In this remote desert town, dotted with trailer
homes and satellite dishes, dark theories of government cover-ups
and alien contacts abounded even before radio host Art Bell
abruptly signed off forever this week.
</P>
<P>
   Now people are willing to believe the worst.
</P>
<P>
   With nothing to go on but Bell's oblique final remarks about a
``threatening, terrible event,'' residents who were fans of ``Coast
to Coast,'' his hugely popular overnight show, and those who were
not say they wouldn't put it past the federal government to try to
coerce him into silence. A few say they wouldn't put it past
aliens, either.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, after all, knew and told. His radio show, the
fourth-most-listened-to in the nation, gave voice to ufologists,
paranormalists, alien kidnap victims, and anyone else connected
with the beyond. Under the slogan, ``The truth is in the night,''
400 stations carried the show's discussions to all corners of the
country; Bell's syndicate estimates 15 million listeners tuned in
regularly. Many locals suspect he hit a sore spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible that he stumbled onto something the government
didn't want the rest of us to know about,'' said Mike Taylor, a
former construction worker who, like many residents, retired early
to Pahrump. ``I'm open to the fact that there's stuff going on
around here, big stuff, hush-hush stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   But the people of Pahrump, a town of about 30,000 some 60 miles
west of Las Vegas, also say they didn't need Bell to tell them the
truth. Their own backyards afford them nighttime views of the skies
above Area 51, the supersecret military facility whose existence
the federal government denies and where many of Bell's fans believe
aliens killed in crash landings are stored. It is viewed as no
coincidence that Pahrump was the first place struck by aliens in
the movie ``Mars Attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in this town knows,'' said electrician Mark Rogers,
pointing toward the Sierra Nevada Mountains, ``that things go on
over that mountain that they aren't supposed to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nye County Sheriff Wade Lieseke Jr., a friend of Bell's
whose reelection campaign sign adorns the metal fence surrounding
Bell's home, insists that there is nothing much to talk about.
Bell, he says, is in no physical danger. Neither he nor his family
has been threatened with injury. No investigation is under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a long conversation with Art Bell and he indicated to me
why he did what he did ...,'' Lieseke said. ``He perceived it as a
threat. I don't perceive it as a physical threat. Anything else,
Art will have to say himself.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bell has refused to comment beyond his final remarks at 2:55
a.m. Nevada time last Monday, fueling speculation about his abrupt
departure that may be put to rest on Monday, when he is scheduled
to make a statement during the first hour of what would be his
normally scheduled broadcast. Alluding to a still-undisclosed
occurrence a year ago, the 51-year-old Bell has told listeners so
far that ``a threatening, terrible event occurred to my family,
which I could not tell you about. Because of that event, and a
succession of other events...this is my final broadcast.'' Then he
signed off and disconnected his telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, friends and fellow UFO buffs say they have been
unable to reach Bell, whose home on the outskirts of Pahrump was
also his studio. An enormous satellite dish sits out back; a
sky-high antenna is visible for blocks around, a beacon for fans
who stop in Pahrump hoping to spot Bell. Premiere Radio Networks,
which syndicates Bell's show and had no warning of his resignation,
said it hopes he will use the equipment again.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Amir Henrickson also said she has no idea what kind
of danger Bell might be in. Guest hosts will sit in at the
microphone for awhile, at Bell's request, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Among Bell's fans and former guests, who ardently believe the
federal government has hidden important information about space
aliens and cattle mutilations from the American people, it was
inevitable his abrupt departure would give rise to conspiracy
theories. Those theories run the gamut from the plausible _ a
dispute with Clear Channel Communications, which last week
announced it was taking over radio giant Jacor Communications Inc.,
which distributed Bell's show _ to the fantastic: an upcoming
abduction.
</P>
<P>
   One, from Ron Bales, a Sioux Falls, S.D., maintenance man who
heads up one of Bell's numerous fan clubs, is that some Bill
Clinton supporters might have threatened Bell to draw attention
away from the president's troubles. Bales has also considered the
possibility that someone in the federal government wanted to shut
up Bell for some unknown reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm torn between a couple of ideas...,'' said Bales, who
listened to the program whenever he could and taped those he
missed, keeping his favorites to play again and again. ``Also, and
this one is from out in left field, maybe it's an alien presence
that doesn't like what Art's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The people who make a career out of trying to contact UFOs don't
consider any premise too farfetched. But they do discount that this
is all a publicity stunt. That would be out of character for Bell,
even if it would net him a wave of publicity during the National
Association of Broadcasters convention, which runs through today.
He took the unknown too seriously for that.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Bassett, a lobbyist for UFO groups, said he spoke with one
friend of Bell's who believed the matter was personal, not
professional. But Bassett said that doesn't jibe with Bell's final
statement and that ``sources'' have told him otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my position as a lobbyist and consultant _ I'm not out
there measuring crop circles _ we are very concerned about things
that are happening to people who are dealing with this subject,''
said Bassett. ``There have been a number of deaths, a number of
cancers...People in the field have a short life expectancy...People
like myself are taking this very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hoagland, whose research into the theory that a mesa on
Mars resembles a human face has not held up well in the wake of new
NASA photography, agreed that Bell must be in danger to cut himself
off so completely. He added that ``rogue elements'' working for the
government but not officially sanctioned by any agency may have
threatened Bell's wife in an attempt to force Bell to rein in his
guests and prescreen callers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art Bell would rather do radio than anything else on this
planet; he's at the top of his game, No. 1 in his time slot, and he
walks away from all that in 30 seconds,'' said Hoagland, a former
NASA consultant and frequent guest on Bell's show. ``Something has
to be terribly wrong. ... There are people in these federal
agencies that make Rambo look like a Sunday School picnic.''
</P>
<P>
   In fast-growing Pahrump, concern for Bell is real but more
subdued. Many of them say Bell, a recluse, has always been a
mystery to them. No one had a clue as to why Bell had dropped off
the air _ though they have theories of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be half a dozen or another things,'' said James
Bonham, a retired tool-and-die maker who reports sometimes seeing
aircraft with lights but no apparent engines hovering above Area
51. ``I don't think it's outer spacey. But nobody really seems to
know and maybe they don't want us to.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   As America awakened from a recession in 1991, the economy had a
lot of work to do.
</P>
<P>
   A real estate collapse had left banks in terrible shape.
Companies had stopped hiring. The federal budget deficit had once
again started to swell. Incomes had stopped rising for most
Americans. Wage inequality had become a national sore. Health
insurance was protecting fewer people. Layoffs were spreading to
white-collar workers. And as the preliminaries got under way for
the 1992 presidential election, Republicans and Democrats alike
promised rapid economic growth that would lift all boats and, in
doing so, sweep away these problems.
</P>
<P>
   America got its expansion, all right _ one that has now lasted
eight years and brought good times to many. But with the global
financial crisis spawning talk of the next recession, much of what
an expansion is supposed to achieve remains undone. For all the
dazzling gains in the stock market, for all the money showered on
Americans _ rich Americans in particular _ for as good as these
times have felt, the report card on this expansion, if a child
brought it home from school, would make a parent wince.
 &UR;  &LR;  Late in the expansion, in 1996, the economy surged, and it is
just now simmering down. But despite the surge, economic growth
measured over the entire cycle makes the expansion of the 1990s the
weakest since World War II. Economies can expand rapidly only when
workers produce significantly more in a given hour of work than
they have in the past. And that did not happen in the '90s, any
more than it had in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   The result is painfully obvious in many households. While
wealthier families enjoyed big gains, particularly from the booming
stock market, most households find that their incomes, adjusted for
inflation, are no higher today than they were in 1989, when the
last expansion ended. Americans, for the most part, have been
running in place for 25 years. And as economies around the world
weaken, Americans are unlikely to gain ground soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a long and smooth and untroubled business-cycle
upswing,'' said Robert Solow, a Nobel laureate in economics at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``But it has not overcome
the long-run sluggishness of the economy. That depends on deeper
things, like technological progress and gains in efficiency. And
finding the secret of those, despite all the advances in computer
technology, is a job that certainly was not accomplished in the
1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s expansion, more than others in the recent past, has
been market-driven, with government playing a lesser role. And some
economists contend that the growth surge in 1996 and 1997 was
evidence of the power of markets, when they are left alone. Yet
even some conservative, market-oriented economists, like Robert
Lucas, the Nobel laureate at the University of Chicago, argue that
the performance of the '90s economy demonstrates that government
action must complement market forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are living through a period of sustained economic growth
without inflation, and the unemployment rate has come down to
levels I never thought I would see again in the United States,''
Lucas said. ``But there are obviously plenty of problems. Poverty
and income inequality are two. These are problems that cannot be
addressed by the markets. They have to be addressed by specific
government programs offering specific solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been gains, of course. The banks _ if suddenly
squeamish about lending _ are certainly healthy again, thanks
largely to government policies, particularly at the Federal
Reserve, intended to help them rebuild. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Hiring has come back, quite robustly, starting in 1993. The
unemployment and inflation rates, in fact, have fallen farther than
anyone anticipated, and that has helped to reduce the percentage of
Americans living in poverty roughly to where it was when the last
recession began, in the summer of 1990. A sharp decline in poverty
among blacks helped to pull down the overall rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even for unskilled people coming off welfare, getting a job
has been relatively easy,'' said David Ellwood, an economist at
Harvard's Kennedy School of government. ``What they have had to
worry about is benefits and salary level.''
</P>
<P>
   The stronger job market has encouraged education, making young
people, in particular, more skilled and competitive, although the
gains have been gradual. Thirty-five percent of all
18-to-24-year-olds are taking college courses, up from 30 percent
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Another hallmark of the 1990s has been capital spending.
Companies have used their robust profits and their increasingly
valuable stock to buy equipment, particularly computers, and to
build factories, stores, malls, hotels and offices.
</P>
<P>
   All this has increased the nation's productive capacity _ so
much so that corporate America is producing and offering for sale
today much more than even avid consumers want to buy. That, along
with a flood of inexpensive imports, has produced another feature
of this expansion: buyers have been able to insist on discounts,
thereby holding down inflation and increasing the purchasing power
of a raise, even a small raise.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer spending has clearly grown. Indeed, as the federal
budget deficit has turned into a surplus, private indebtedness,
particularly for consumers, has risen to record levels, giving the
economy the sort of boost that government deficits did in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But that debt accumulation has come at a cost. By one estimate,
5 percent of all the nation's households have filed for bankruptcy
protection the last five years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If the economy goes into a downturn, is it safer to have the
government running up debt, or the citizenry? After all, the
government, in a pinch, can print money or borrow more to meet its
obligations, while the citizenry is not nearly so flexible. If
layoffs or shrinking stock portfolios or falling home prices were
to leave consumers without the means to pay their loans, the
defaults and bankruptcies could weigh at least as heavily on the
economy as the shock from a collapsing hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
   While the job market is strong, layoffs are nevertheless running
ahead of 1980s levels. Many jobs lack company-subsidized health
insurance _ 18.3 percent of the nonelderly are without coverage, up
from 16.1 percent in 1990. But the robust hiring and the declining
unemployment rate had an unexpected payoff.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of inflation, the Federal Reserve in the past had often
cut off an expansion prematurely or watered it down by raising
interest rates to discourage business activity. The signal for
doing this was the unemployment rate. When it fell below 5.5
percent, the Fed worried that labor shortages would force employers
to offer higher wages to get enough workers. Companies would then
pay for the wage increases by raising their prices. And up would go
the inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
   That dynamic, enshrined in economic theory, is clearly fallible.
The unemployment rate is down to 4.6 percent, and the Consumer
Price Index, instead of rising, has fallen below 2 percent. Clearly
the old worries about low unemployment were not on the minds of Fed
policy makers when they cut interest rates on Thursday, the second
cut in 16 days. Staving off the recession that is spreading across
the globe _ and quelling the panic that has begun to curtail
lending, investment and spending _ seemed much more to the point.
</P>
<P>
   Summing up the new thinking, Janet Yellen, chairman of President
Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers and a former Fed governor,
said: ``As long as production facilities are not overly strained,
which they aren't today, then it may be possible to have tighter
labor markets than we used to think possible without pushing up the
inflation rate.''
</P>
<P>
   The most prosperous decade in American history, the 1960s,
featured similarly low inflation and unemployment. Citing this
comparison, more than a few experts have proclaimed a historic
breakthrough in the 1990s. This expansion, they said, heralded a
new era of great prosperity _ a victory for the American model of
free-market capitalism in which income would be spread, in time,
more evenly than it has been in recent years, and more generously.
</P>
<P>
   That is still a popular view in some quarters. ``This is the
most extraordinary domestic economic expansion in modern history,''
said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of
Manufacturers, ``in terms of economic growth, inflation, jobs and
income, although the income may be less than the others.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the optimism, the new era has not arrived. The main
measure of any economic expansion is economic growth, which is the
rising value of all of the nation's production of cars, appliances,
new homes, Broadway musicals, legal advice, long-distance telephone
service and the like, added together. By that measure, the 1990s
have not measured up.
</P>
<P>
   The 1960s certainly did. Economic growth in that decade averaged
4.7 percent a year, almost double the performance in the 1990s.
Indeed, for a century from the Gilded Age until 1973, the economy
expanded at a 3 percent annual rate, or more, most of the time. And
then, in the early 1970s, the United States tumbled into a rut of
tepid economic growth, which still prevails. The pie, in effect,
has grown more slowly than in the past, and the 1990s expansion has
failed to break this pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is productivity: whether workers are producing
significantly more in a given hour on the job this year than they
did last year. If so, and if that improvement is multiplied across
the work force, then the economy as a whole expands more rapidly.
The telephone operator who handles 100 calls an hour in a given
year answers 103 the next year and 106 the next; the factory worker
similarly stamps out more car hoods, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Productivity typically expanded better than 2 percent a year
before 1973. But in the current expansion, productivity growth has
averaged only 1.3 percent a year, despite better performances in a
few industries, up only slightly from the 1.1 percent average in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is not something you would want to make
anything out of,'' said Edwin Dean, chief of the division that
compiles productivity statistics at the Labor Department's Bureau
of Labor Statistics. ``You are not positive the difference is real
rather than a measurement error.''
</P>
<P>
   Next month, the 1990s expansion becomes the second-longest since
World War II, surpassing that of the 1980s. And early next year, if
a recession does not intervene, the expansion will become the
longest since the war, finally beating out, in longevity, the great
1960s expansion.
</P>
<P>
   But longevity is not enough. Despite the late burst of growth,
the annual growth rate over the entire '90s business cycle _ from
the end of the last expansion through this year's second quarter _
has averaged only 2.5 percent, the weakest performance since World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   The significance of that figure is that without sufficient
economic growth, household incomes cannot increase. And indeed,
since 1973, the income gains in periods of expansion for the
so-called median household (half of all households earn less, half
earn more) have barely offset the losses during recessions.
Adjusted for inflation, individual wages and household incomes
typically fall in recessions and rebound in the expansions. But
while the losses were small and the rebounds robust before 1973,
the opposite pattern has prevailed since then, and net gains have
been hard to detect.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s cycle is clearly not an exception. After adjustment
for inflation, the median household's annual income, $37,005 in
1997, is roughly where it was in 1989, the final year of the last
expansion, the Census Bureau reported last month.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the 1997 level was only $1,260 above 1973's income
of $35,745. Many households in the 1960s added more to their
incomes in a single year than their counterparts today have added
in 25 years. And they did it with one wage earner, not two or
three, working fewer hours than the average jobholder does today.
</P>
<P>
   Such changes hurt. Even in good times, the long working hours
strain family life. If a recession should hit, layoffs and wage
freezes could rattle families that have gone deeply into debt in
the '90s to maintain their spending patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the tide recedes, we are likely to find a lot of the old
problems that we had before, only more so,'' said Robert Reich, the
former labor secretary in the Clinton administration and now a
professor at Brandeis University.
</P>
<P>
   A huge problem left unresolved as the expansion appears to wind
down is a divisive inequality that has developed among income
groups, a trend that took root in the 1980s and that the 1990s
expansion has failed to interrupt. Pay for low-income workers, or
people earning less than $7 an hour, has increased smartly in this
recovery, pushed up partly by a higher minimum wage and the
earned-income tax credit, which is, in effect, a federal wage
subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   But the gains among high-end jobholders have been even greater,
widening the inequality. And workers in the middle, earning $9.75
to $15.50 an hour, lost ground, after adjusting their pay for
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   For Lucas, the University of Chicago economist, economic growth
is not capable of resolving such problems, even if the 1990s
expansion manages to survive the global crisis, with help from the
Federal Reserve or with some other economic stimulant. Government
ingenuity is called for, he said, adding, ``You cannot ask too much
from economic growth.''

RUSSIA THREATENED WITH WIDESPREAD HUNGER THIS WINTER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A human chocolate bar merrily bounced through the
crowded hall past the friendly elves in straw hats dishing out
yogurt and fruit juices. Plump butchers proudly displayed salami
mountains, while a large butterfly fashioned from cold cuts and a
beaming young woman surrounded by clusters of balloons dispensed
Eskimo ice cream bars.
</P>
<P>
   This festive cornucopia of Russian food products appeared Friday
in Moscow's central exhibition hall. It was an odd sight as the
poorest harvest in decades and the worst economic crisis in years
threatened Russia with what could be a harsh winter of widespread
hunger and shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Stranger still was the upbeat mood among the food show's
predominantly Russian participants, including producers from some
of the remote far north regions where international relief agencies
fear millions of people could go without basic foodstuffs this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Russians have a saying to explain this apparent contradiction _
``net khuda bez dobra:'' ``There is nothing bad that is not
accompanied by something good.''
</P>
<P>
   One side effect of Russia's financial crisis, during which the
ruble has lost 60 percent of its value, is that imports providing
half of the diet of Russia's large cities became prohibitively
expensive. As a result, domestic food producers suddenly feel
wanted again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say we haven't suffered, and we have even won in
the sense that now our prices no longer look so bad compared with
imports,'' said Nikolai Buldyldin, a top trade official with the
Yamal-Nenets region, a desolate stretch of tundra along the Kara
Sea shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   The region produces the delicious white salmon that Buldydldin
describes as ``an elite fish.'' It has been impossible buy in any
Moscow store because until now, imports from Europe were cheaper.
The outdated distribution system that dogs the entire post-Soviet
food industry made it harder to get fish from Yamal-Nenets to
Moscow than from Norway.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the loss of Soviet-era subsidies made it impossible
for the Yamal-Nenets fish business, like most Russian companies, to
survive without resorting to barter and mutual debt writeoffs. As
with most firms in the food industry, production has plummeted as
the country turned increasingly to imports.
</P>
<P>
   But overall imports to Russia plunged 45 percent in September
because most people can no longer afford them, the government
conceded last week. The flow of imported food has slowed to a
trickle, because no one wants to buy it or distribute it in a
country where the ruble, which has been stable at around 15 to the
dollar for weeks, could return into freefall at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one in Russia wants to appear happy about the
crisis, northern fish factories and other domestic food producers
now find that they can ship their product affordably by using
special rail rates introduced by the government to ease the flow of
foodstuffs during the hard times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fish is full of calories and vitamins so you don't starve,
with enough fat to keep you from freezing to death,'' said Ivan
Zakharov of the far northern region of Tyumen, another fish
wholesaler whose products have become popular in the crisis. Behind
him, as he displayed an array of pungent dried and pickled fish
products soon to hit Moscow's markets, was his firms' slogan: ``The
taste you know from your youth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can live through the winter and hopefully make it to the
next harvest,'' Zakharov said.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, it is hard to reconcile this optimism with the
gloomy assessment produced by western diplomats, relief agencies
and even a Russian parliamentary commission that has recommended
evacuating over a million people from places like Zakharov's Tyumen
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Red Cross launched an emergency $15 million
appeal to help poor, elderly and disabled Russians hit hard by the
economic crisis. ``We can't exclude the possibility of mass
starvation if the situation continues to deteriorate,'' Borje
Sjokvist, head of the Moscow delegation of the International
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Some 12 million people who reside in the hostile climates of
Russia's Far North, the human legacy of the failed Soviet dream to
conquer the resource-rich Arctic, face a winter of hunger due to
the breakdown of supply networks. Many of these people live in
cities that have no growing season and can only be supplied by ship
or river barge during the short summer season.
</P>
<P>
   The whole country may suffer shortages of meat, vegetable oil
and butter starting in January, a private agriculture think-tank
headed by former Agriculture Minister Viktor Khlystun predicted in
a report announced Friday in the Russian media.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a disaster in the making, and there doesn't seem to be
any way to avoid it,'' said one Western diplomat, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said his bankrupt
government had found $600 million to create an emergency food
reserve that will last two weeks and cover one-third of Russia's
148 million residents. Russia has also asked for food and medicine
from the European Union to survive the winter, and has been
conducting talks with the United States on receiving grain and
other foods on long-term credit and as humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
   Such plans are at odds with the words of Deputy Prime Minister
Gennady Kulik, who this week declared: ``Russian producers are
capable of feeding the country by themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But years, even decades, or shortage and crisis have left
Russians unflappable in the face of disaster. Here, the bar is
higher on suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone used to a stable, logical or predictable situation can
easily find himself shocked by our daily life,'' commented Viktor
Dobrostosky, a senior Russian Agricultural Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people are used to living within their means and getting
by,'' added Lena Cherdashina, marketing manager for Mistral, a
Russian company that sells smartly packaged rice products. ``Rice
is one of the things people are buying.''
</P>
<P>
   And many Russians just like winter, no matter what it brings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever seen the Russian winter?,'' asked Olga Tolstik,
marketing manager from an ice-cream maker in the Urals capital of
Yekaterinburg, her eyes dancing with the reflection of hundreds of
Eskimo ice cream bars in their bright wrappers. ``It's all snow and
delicious cold and endless, clean white, like Russian ice cream.''

 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the American cultural historian Ann Douglas was
deep into the 13th century for her doctoral dissertation at
Harvard, she discovered what she calls predecessors of the modern
media: the handmade books created by Roman Catholic priests in
England and France to record the religious visions of illiterate
peasants. As Ms. Douglas tells it, the peasants described their
visions, and the priests compiled them in books used to promote
their orders. ``It was that fundamental process,'' Ms. Douglas
said, ``by which the private becomes public.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then Ms. Douglas has continually rediscovered how often
that process occurs. In a body of work that covers almost a century
and a half of American history, Ms. Douglas has seen again and
again how the private has become public. To her, Kenneth Starr's
investigation into President Clinton's sex life is just the latest
example. Indeed, in her view (sharpened by a book in progress about
Cold War culture in the United States), Starr has picked up where
Sen. Joseph McCarthy left off.
</P>
<P>
   The criminalization of sexual behavior was born in the 1950s,
she said, ``when you had senators saying that basically
homosexuality was an indicator that someone was a communist.'' The
Starr investigation reflects nothing less than ``the victory of
Cold War aims revamped for the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel some sort of horrified sense of being caught in a
re-enactment,'' Ms. Douglas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think how happy he would be to be in Ken Starr's spot,'' she
added. (Ms. Douglas describes herself as a ``Democrat on the
left.'') ``He didn't dream of anything quite like this. And he
absolutely knew that Americans loved to see facts and documents. He
would have totally understood the 36 boxes. The visuals are very,
very similar here. Of course there are differences, but boy, are
there a lot of parallels.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Douglas, 56, is a professor of English and comparative
literature at Columbia University. She talked the other day in her
Riverside Drive apartment not only about Clinton, Starr and the
Cold War, but also about her struggle with alcoholism, her
religion, the 8,000 books in her apartment and her upper-class New
Jersey childhood in which ``Protestant theology survived only as a
belief in caste, polite manners and conventional behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   She rarely came up for air during the discussion and was
simultaneously dizzying, exhausting and riveting. Sometimes she
wandered off on entire expeditions away from the main point and
made intellectual leaps from Hannah Arendt to Marilyn Monroe to the
``horrifying'' stiletto heels and stiff hair of the 1950s American
woman, who looked, she said, like ``a miniature defense industry.''
</P>
<P>
   A former student, Patrick Horrigan, likens Ms. Douglas'
classroom style to performance art. David Damrosch, the chairman of
Columbia's English department, remembers that a student once told
him that Ms. Douglas' teaching style was so magnetic that it seemed
as if ``we're all going to heaven together.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Douglas' first book, ``The Feminization of American
Culture,'' published in 1977, argues that the Victorian era gave
birth to the first products of modern mass culture _ the romance
novels and women's magazines catering to the middle-class American
matriarch _ and that advances in printing made their distribution
far more widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrible Honesty: Mongrel Manhattan in the 1920s,'' her second
book, is a kind of sequel showing how black and white artists
revolted against the sentimentality of earlier eras and saw their
ideas more rapidly disseminated in movies, radio and the tabloid
press. In her Cold War book, ``If You Live You Burn: Cold War
Culture in the United States: 1939-1965,'' Ms. Douglas will argue
that the advent of television fed McCarthyism.
</P>
<P>
   The most sensational scandals and trials of 20th-century
America, Ms. Douglas said, have occurred in the three decades _ the
'20s, '50s and '90s _ that saw the creation of new media: radio,
television and the Internet. She pointed to the Scopes and Leopold
and Loeb trials of the 1920s, the Alger Hiss and Rosenberg trials
of the 1950s and now Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this whole medical theory that when surgeons develop
new tools,'' Ms. Douglas said, ``they overuse operations that will
test them. When mankind has new tools, he will think up the events
and the situations in which it can use them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Douglas is best known for ``Terrible Honesty,'' which took
15 years to write and which she said was delayed at least five
years by her alcoholism. (Ms. Douglas stopped drinking in 1988;
``Terrible Honesty'' was published in 1995.) ``I had to redo so
much of the work I'd done,'' Ms. Douglas said. She was haunted by
the people in the book _ F. Scott Fitzgerald, Dorothy Parker,
William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway _ whose drinking shadowed their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got in a cul-de-sac of not being able to see the characters
whole anymore because I was so caught up in the most negative parts
of their lives,'' she said. ``It wasn't that I was trying to be
like them, it was more that I was afraid that `How can it be that I
have all these people's problems without their genius?' It was more
this growing sense of horror that my whole life, a much less life,
was going to be consumed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Douglas attempted suicide twice, recovered and kept
drinking. Her turning point came on a beautiful autumn day a decade
ago when she was sitting in her living room, overlooking the
Hudson, and thinking, ``Very soon I'm going to be dead.'' But then
``this thought'' came into her mind, telling her not to surrender.
``Basically, I would call it my soul,'' she said. ``I certainly
hadn't heard from it for a while. Within 24 hours I was on the
phone to hospitals looking for treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Her Cold War book has ``a whole new batch'' of drinkers for her
to deal with: ``Charlie Parker! Bud Powell! Jack Kerouac! William
Burroughs!'' She laughed ruefully but said she could handle them
now.
</P>
<P>
   Her colleagues agree. ``The last few years have been an
extraordinary process of flowering for Ann,'' Damrosch said. ``It
was like a floodgate opened. She's just everywhere now; she's
constantly writing. There's a real electricity in the air when
she's around.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Douglas was married for a decade, divorced, then was
involved for 12 years with Jay Fellows, a professor at Cooper Union
and an alcoholic, who died of alcohol poisoning in 1990. She lives
alone, has no children and finds strength in what she calls the
spiritualism that came into her life after she stopped drinking.
(She was raised in the Dutch Reformed Church but now calls herself
generically a Christian.) Although Ms. Douglas does not go to
services, she says prayers in the evening and reads a small part of
the Bible each morning. ``It seems to work for me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She has decided that her recovery was not from her efforts
alone: ``I believe that something intervened in my life, and I
choose to call that God. I really don't know any other way to
describe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Douglas described herself as a public alcoholic _
``in my world, everybody knew I was an alcoholic'' _ she
nonetheless said she could not imagine having every aspect of her
past open for debate on the Internet. ``There's so much to be
embarrassed about _ take your pick,'' she said. With Starr's
dissemination of the details of the president's sex life, Ms.
Douglas said, ``It amazes me that people aren't thinking, `This
could be me.'''
</P>
<P>
   On a less somber note, Ms. Douglas said she was also irritated
that the four-hour broadcast of the president's grand jury
testimony cut into ``All My Children,'' which she has watched
regularly for 22 years. It started when Ms. Douglas began watching
the show with a friend who was having a nervous breakdown. The
friend was staying with her, and her doctor had recommended a soap
opera as part of her therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She recovered, went back to work, and I've been watching it
ever since,'' Ms. Douglas said cheerfully. ``I love narrative, and
soap is pure narrative. Meaning it will go on and on as long as
life. And it is, I think, kind of therapeutic.''

<P>
   OK, the Federal Reserve may have been stingy when it cut its
short-term interest rate target by only a quarter of a percentage
point at its last policy meeting Sept. 29. But on Thursday, just 16
days later, it more than made up for that, slicing off another
quarter point. As if to add emphasis to the central bank's message
that it is alert to the world's financial problems _ especially
that of its banks _ this cut came in between the regularly
scheduled meetings of the policy-setting Federal Open Market
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were ecstatic. After the afternoon announcement from
the Fed, it took the Dow Jones industrial average less than 45
minutes to surge nearly 300 points. The rally continued Friday.
</P>
<P>
   And more upbeat news is on its way. The odds are good for more
reductions by the Fed in its short-term interest rate target, the
federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks. After the last
two moves, the Fed funds rate is now 5 percent. But by March,
investors are expecting that rate to drop to an average of 4.23
percent, based on the current price for the March Fed funds futures
contract.
</P>
<P>
   All this is positive. But the signs of world financial distress
still abound. Japan is working on banking reform, but its economy
is still a mess. Congress has approved more money for the
International Monetary Fund, but the United States and its allies
still need to agree on new rescue strategies for the IMF. And there
are many Wall Street firms and banks that still have big bets on
bonds and other investments that have _ or can _ go sour.
</P>
<P>
   These problems are reflected in the spreads _ the difference
between the yields on U.S. Treasury securities and other bonds,
like corporate, mortgage, junk or emerging market. These spreads
have surged since the Russian debt crisis. And although they have
come down some, they are still quite high.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday, the yield on emerging markets bonds was 12.22
percentage points above comparable Treasury maturities, according
to a J.P. Morgan index of emerging market bonds. That was down from
a high of 17.05 percentage points on Sept. 10 but still twice the 6
percentage point spread in July.
</P>
<P>
   The spread for American junk bonds, according to a Merrill Lynch
monthly index, was at 5.73 percentage points at the end of last
month, more than 2 percentage points higher than in June. The
spread for investment grade corporate debt was at 1.70 percentage
points, higher than it was during the 1990-91 recession.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is clear. At these levels, interest rates are
strangling the flow of credit to corporations and countries, which
cannot afford to borrow. And if banks reduce their risk-taking and
curtail their lending, the economy will slow sharply, and could
even fall into a recession.
</P>
<P>
   The spreads reflect two different worries, said Michael
Rosenberg, head of international fixed-income research at Merrill
Lynch. ``There is the worry of increased default and a recession
coming,'' he said. ``Also, there is the worry that a significant
part of the investment community may still be leveraged and has to
sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Allyn, the chief economist at Scudder Kemper
Investments, added: ``The new risk is that markets are in control
of who gets credit and who doesn't.'' And that may mean so much
control has been turned over to the markets that authorities _ like
the Fed _ ``do not have the levers to do what they need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why these spreads are an important monitor for
investors. Until they shrink back to more normal levels, the
chances of an economic slowdown will be much greater. And until
they shrink, there will still be a good chance that hedge funds,
like Long-Term Capital Management, and some Wall Street firms, as
well, will face the kind of losses that, when reported, could
trigger a selloff.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no all-clear signal until spreads come in,'' Ms.
Allyn said.

INVESTING WITH: GARY LEWIS OF VAN KAMPEN EMERGING GROWTH  
 (RESENDING TO ADD GRAPHIC NOTE )
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Oct. 18) 
(JT) 
 By WILLIAM R. LONG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I've got a calm personality, so I don't get too excited when
we go way up, and I don't get too down when we go way down,'' Gary
Lewis, the manager of the Van Kampen Emerging Growth fund, said
from his 45th-floor office in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   This is fortunate, for funds like Lewis', invested in mid-cap
stocks with relatively high price-to-earnings ratios, have taken it
on the chin. Through Oct. 9, the fund has lost 29.8 percent since
the market's peak on July 17, nearly double the 16.7 percent lost
by the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index of large-cap stocks, and even a
tad worse than its average peer mid-cap growth fund, which lost
29.4 percent, according to Morningstar, the Chicago financial
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the fund's assets have fallen from more than
$4.8 billion at the market peak to $3.47 billion now, it has yet to
see significant defections. Apparently investors and brokers have
faith in Lewis' impressive long-term record.
</P>
<P>
   Since Lewis, 45, started managing Van Kampen Emerging Growth in
April 1989, the fund has returned 17.5 percent annually on average
through Oct. 9, compared with 11.8 percent for its peers and 16.6
percent for the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   How does Lewis cope with these careening markets? Discipline. He
keeps adhering to his basic investing principles. It may not
prevent investors from losing money in a selloff, he said, but
picking and holding the right stocks can keep a portfolio poised
for a comeback when the market turns.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis looks for two basic characteristics in a stock. First, he
wants companies identified by Wall Street analysts as likely to see
their earnings grow, generally at a rate of 20 percent or more
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Second, in what must seem heretical to value-oriented investors,
Lewis seeks out companies whose price-to-earnings ratios are on the
rise, believing that increasing ratios are the market's way of
showing that further good news is around the corner. He also
sometimes looks at price-to-sales ratios, especially for companies
whose earnings might be skewed by such things as one-time expenses
and write-offs.
</P>
<P>
   A price-to-earnings or price-to-sales ratio that is not rising
is a sign of trouble with a company, he believes, even if earnings
estimates and earnings are increasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That tells us that the company is delivering great
fundamentals, but for some reason the market is not rewarding them
for those good fundamentals,'' Lewis said. He believes that the
reason is usually that ``the market is starting to anticipate that
those fundamentals are going to change.'' A stock in this situation
may become a candidate for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis rejects the term ``momentum investor,'' often applied to
adherents of high price-to-earnings investing, because he looks
closely at fundamentals and does not indiscriminately buy companies
with rising earnings. For example, he uses a yardstick common to
growth investors: he prefers a stock whose P/E ratio is lower than
the number associated with its forecasted one-year earnings growth
rate.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis acknowledges that his frameworks for decisions to sell are
not well suited for market downdrafts, when P/E ratios drop no
matter what the fundamentals of the companies are. But in more
bullish markets, he said, ``It's a good early warning indicator
that there is a change in perception.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for example, the fund had big investments in
petroleum-industry service companies. ``All those companies had
huge earnings growth expectations,'' Lewis said. However, their
valuations started dropping in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of the first quarter, we were basically out of the
group,'' he said, and the stocks, already falling by then,
subsequently sold off with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's biggest holding is Dell Computer, which he started
buying in 1996 and which now accounts for 6.6 percent of the
portfolio. Lewis paid an average price of about $4.50. Dell closed
last week at $56.6875.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we bought the stock in mid-1996 and the fall of 1996, we
had a lot of Wall Street analysts downgrading the company because
the stock had appreciated up to 15 times trailing earnings,'' Lewis
said. ``But today, the company is at 60 times trailing earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Another technology stock, Yahoo Inc., is the fund's 12th-largest
holding. Lewis acknowledged that the booming Internet company's
share price is steep. It traded at 269.5 times 1998 earnings last
Friday. But its 1998 earnings growth should grow by far more than
that, he said. Lewis started buying the stock early this year, and
paid an average of $51. Yahoo closed last week at $115.625.
</P>
<P>
   When Lewis began moving into the retail sector last year, one of
his biggest buys was Best Buy, which sells personal computers,
software and consumer electronics. He began buying shares last fall
at an average price of about $22. Best Buy closed at $41 last week.
</P>
<P>
   To track valuation on this company, Lewis said, he looks more at
the price-to-sales ratio than at the price-to-earnings multiple.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you looked at a chart of its price-to-sales ratio, you
could see it's going straight up,'' he said. ``That's the kind of
thing that clues us in as to there's a real strong fundamental
change.''
</P>
<P>
   He said in the case of Best Buy, there were a lot of factors at
work. Many of the company's competitors have closed since 1996,
Best Buy has changed its product mix for better customer appeal and
profitability, and a shift to digital electronics is spurring
demand for its products.
</P>
<P>
   A recession could change that, and ``Wall Street is buying into
a pretty serious recession'' in 1999, he said. But he does not
believe such predictions, even though stock prices have been hit
hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I don't think there's a fundamental basis for what
we've been seeing in the market,'' he said. ``There's just a lot of
panic going on.''

AFTER BUDGET DEAL, IT'S TIME TO WRITE THE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind.)  (See also CONGRESS-PORN, CONGRESS-CLINTON) 
(bl) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some conservatives sounded notes of discord Friday
over the federal spending agreement, but they also said they would
probably vote for the $500 billion package because it boosted
defense spending and provided aid to farmers.
</P>
<P>
   However, no one can vote on the package just yet, because it is
not finished.
</P>
<P>
   The deal that President Clinton and Republican leaders hailed
Thursday was a broad outline of areas of agreement on the final
portion of the $1.7 trillion budget, not a written document. That
is now being crafted by the chairmen of the spending committees and
their aides, who said Friday that there were still disputes that
needed to be resolved and that the final document could run to more
than 3,000 pages.
</P>
<P>
   For example, still unresolved is a dispute over whether airlines
can create a ``peanut-free'' zone to protect passengers who are
allergic to peanuts. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other members
from Georgia, a major peanut-producing state, are fighting the
proposal, which would force airlines to ban peanuts within three
rows of someone with an allergy.
</P>
<P>
   Congress gave itself until midnight Tuesday to vote on the final
bill, agreeing with President Clinton to a fifth extension of
temporary financing to keep the government open. The budget was due
Oct. 1, the start of the new fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was initially expected Friday, but the bill is nowhere
near to being written.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of top-level bargainers _ including Gingrich,
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and White House chief of staff
Erskine Bowles _ were in the room for the final deal. Excluded were
the committee chairmen and the heads of the appropriation
committees, who now must write the language that will put the deal
into law.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone on Capitol Hill expects the budget to pass
eventually, with the biggest defections coming from conservatives
who object to the $20 billion taken from the surplus to address
so-called emergencies and for the package's failure to offer voters
a serious tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   The lag time before the bill is officially closed is making some
conservatives nervous that more members will try to add provisions
that will further expand a bill they already consider overly
bloated. And some worry that once the hometown pork that is stuffed
into the bill is publicly revealed, voters could put pressure on
members not to support it. The elections are Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   But several conservatives said that despite these problems, they
expected to support the bill anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., said: `Most of my friends, who are
predominantly activist conservatives, are split about 50-50. If tax
cuts were your primary thing, then you're unhappy, but many
conservatives have a mixed agenda. My position is, hold the nose
and vote yes. We have no tax cuts and far too much spending that I
oppose, but that's the nature of compromise. Every member has a
little different focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Souder said he liked the extra money for defense spending, and
he liked the price supports for farmers. Hog farmers in his
district, whose biggest customers were Japan and China, had been
hit hard by the collapse of Asian markets.

TRIMBLE IN COLORADO AS AWARD IS ANNOUNCED

   DENVER _ Shortly before sunup in Denver Friday, one of the new
Nobel Peace Prize winners, David Trimble, held an impromptu news
conference outside the Brown Palace Hotel as he hurried to meetings
with business leaders on the final day of a trade mission here.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble told a few reporters that the award was a great honor,
and one that he hoped foretold a true peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quite sure that we've crossed a watershed this year, and I
don't think there'll be any going back,'' said Trimble, 54.
``There's still some difficulties on the road, some obstacles to
negotiate, but I think we will manage to do that and this award may
help that.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimble was asleep at 3 a.m. when the awards were announced, and
members of his staff fielded calls from around the world until they
woke him with the news two hours later. He was greeted by the glare
of local TV news camera lights and microphones as he left his
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was given a standing ovation at his scheduled
breakfast meeting with about 100 business and civic leaders, the
leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, the main Protestant party,
steered talk back to the business at hand. ``Thank you, thank you,
but we've got some business to do,'' he told the crowd. Trimble is
a member of a delegation touring 11 U.S. cities in three weeks in
an effort to interest companies to do business in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The real prize will be lasting peace for his country and
prosperity to go with it, he told reporters. ``The honor is for all
those who worked so hard in the peace process, and the honor is for
the people of Northern Ireland who endorsed that process and who
have longed for peace for so long,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for sharing the honor with John Hume, leader of the Catholic
Social Democratic and Labor Party, Trimble said he thought it was
``appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel quite happy to share the award with John,'' he said
with a laugh. ``I think by honoring both our parties the committee
has been very wise.''

PRIZE HAS LITTLE EFFECT ON HUME'S WORKDAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also NOBEL-PEACE, NOBEL-NIRELAND-COLO) 
(mk) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ On the morning he won the Nobel
Peace Prize, John Hume got out of bed, as usual at 8:30, made
himself some cereal and bananas for breakfast and prepared to spend
another day in his life's work: trying to permanently end sectarian
violence in this predominantly Protestant British province.
</P>
<P>
   But before the news of the prize came, Hume, the most prominent
mainstream Roman Catholic leader in the province, could not help
wondering about the award, he said in an interview here Friday
afternoon. Two years ago he had also been nominated, but the only
Nobel prize given to an Irishman went to the poet Seamus Heaney,
who went to school with Hume 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me I would get a phone call from the prize committee
if I won,'' he said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But when his time came, ``I never got the phone call,'' he said.
Instead, a Norwegian journalist phoned him from Oslo and said there
were reports that he had won. His wife, Pat, turned on the radio at
about 10 a.m. in the living room of their house in Londonderry,
west of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got it, John!'' shouted his wife, who has also been his
chief assistant for the 30 years of his relentless campaign for a
peaceful settlement involving the Protestant majority, the Catholic
minority and the British army and police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I thought when I heard,'' he said. ``I was
very pleased, of course. But I see it as a very powerful statement
that has given international endorsement for the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, he straightened his gold and black patterned necktie and
went to work, talking peace to groups in Londonderry and Belfast,
acknowledging without a smile that he was pleased with the award.
</P>
<P>
   In public, he used the same old calm, logical words he has used
thousands of times, telling an audience of Catholic and Protestant
schoolgirls in Belfast that, ``We'll spill our sweat together, not
our blood. Your generation must lay the foundation for a new
society. Did you choose to be born Catholic or Protestant? So why
fight with someone from the other community.''
</P>
<P>
   And he quoted the words of warning his unemployed father gave to
him as a boy in persuading him to shun the violence of the
overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republican Army: ``You can't eat a
flag.''
</P>
<P>
   He posed with the girls, opening his too-tight suit jacket and
revealing that he has grown heavier in recent months. His sometimes
unkempt black hair was neatly combed. Some of the girls tittered
and squeaked and asked for his autograph.
</P>
<P>
   Being treated like a celebrity was an unfamiliar role. The
paternal advice led Hume, a French teacher in the 1960s, to become
a champion of a peaceful settlement. In Washington he urged the
government not to listen to highly vocal IRA supporters in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   But during a day of fielding hundreds of questions, he refused,
when asked, to say the prize was a validation of his life's work.
However, most ordinary people here, government officials including
President Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, and
experts agree that without Hume's effort there would be no peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The pact, approved in the spring, drastically reshapes political
power in the province, giving Catholics more power and giving the
overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic more influence in northern
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nobel Prize also underscored the fact that Hume, 61, and
suffering from a nerve disorder, is getting ready to distance
himself from the wearying peace effort _ thousands of debates,
seemingly endless contentious issues, deals within deals, careful
political statements designed to keep the two sides talking, not
shooting and bombing.
</P>
<P>
   His gradual withdrawal from the effort began in June when he
allowed Seamus Mallow, a colleague in the mainstream Catholic
Social Democratic Labor Party, to become the Catholic leader in the
new Northern Ireland Assembly with the title deputy first minister.
The first minister, Protestant unionist leader David Trimble, who
was in the United States, shared Friday's award with Hume.
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, at the Dominican College here, a girl said
Hume seemed to be drifting away from Northern Ireland after all his
years as a peace advocate. No, he said, he would continue to work
for the province in London where he is a member of Parliament and
in Strasbourg where he has a seat in the European Parliament, as
well as in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that he had stepped back in the new
Assembly, where much hard work remains, because ``I couldn't take
on the extra work.''
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter for French television asked what he would do
with his share of the $960,000 prize money, he said in lightly
accented, fluent French, ``Ce n'est pas pour moi, mais pour le
peuple. Un prix symbolique.'' (``It is not for me, but for the
people. A symbolic prize.'')
</P>
<P>
   As to the money, he smiled broadly and said he would be able to
use it ``tres bien.'' (``Very well.'')

THE SCENE: CAN MIDEAST LEADERS OVERCOME 19 MONTHS OF SUSPICIONS AND
ANTAGONISM? 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MIDEAST-TALKS) 
(js) 
 By SERGE SCHMEMANN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WYE MILLS, Md. _ The theory behind the current Middle East
meetings at the Wye Plantation is that if you lock feuding leaders
together in a pretty spot, chase away the press, strip off their
pinstripes or military tunics and put the U.S. president between
them, they will surely see the light.
</P>
<P>
   The technique carries the built-in bonus of supplying an instant
historic label _ ``the Camp David Agreement,'' ``the Dayton
Accords,'' ``the Wye Agreement'' _ around which all involved can
garner the glory and TV time such events generate.
</P>
<P>
   It worked at Camp David for the Israeli-Egyptian peace agreement
and in Dayton, Ohio, for the Bosnia deal, so why should it not
work, went the logic, for the seemingly superficial disputes over
territory and security that have kept the Oslo process between
Israel and the Palestinians from moving forward for 19 months?
</P>
<P>
   One possible reason was the same one that created the freeze in
the first place, the total lack of mutual trust between the
government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Palestinian
Authority of Yasser Arafat. It is too early to tell whether being
locked up together for a few days has made Netanyahu and Arafat
chummier, but it clearly made them, or at least their aides,
suspicious of what was going on behind the police patrols.
</P>
<P>
   So despite the finest efforts of the Clinton administration, the
old hostilities briefly breached the plantation fence on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the ground rules of the summit conference, only the
Americans were to brief the press, which was corralled several
miles from the conference center on the modern campus of Chesapeake
College. From the outset, suspicious Israelis and Palestinians sent
their own monitors to see what James Rubin, the State Department
spokesman, was saying.
</P>
<P>
   When Rubin finished Friday morning's briefing, he saw to his
astonishment that both Netanyahu's spokesman, Aviv Bushinsky, and
Arafat's spokesman, Marwan Kanafani, were busily dispensing
information to clutches of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin quickly snatched Bushinsky out of his clutch and in a
stage whisper demanded an explanation. Bushinsky said Kanafani
started briefing first. Rubin strode over to Kanafani. After a bit
more shuttle diplomacy, he finally got the two together and
compelled them to shake hands on a gentlemen's agreement that they
would leak no more.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if someone breeches the deal?'' Bushinsky demanded.
``Then we'll talk to the leaders,'' Rubin declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unnatural for either side to avoid discussions with the
media on an issue of this paramount importance,'' Rubin later
acknowledged, with an evident familiarity with the fierce leaking
that is commonplace in the Israeli political arena. ``We recognize
that. What we're trying to do is tamp it down so people won't waste
valuable and scarce time being irritated over what the other said
in the media, when so much has to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   By common agreement, though now strictly off the record, the
incident was a microcosm of the problems facing the summit meeting.
Basically, Israel is being asked to cede another 13 percent of the
West Bank in exchange for concrete Palestinian steps against
terrorism, and some assurance that Arafat will put off proclaiming
a Palestinian state on May 4, 1999, the day on which the Oslo
process formally comes to an end.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the 13 percent has been agreed to, but not much
else. And the question, asked by virtually every Israeli
commentator over the last week, is how can President Clinton and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright hope to overcome in 72 hours
the accumulated antagonisms that have blocked a deal for 19 months.
</P>
<P>
   One answer is politics, sometimes described as the art of the
possible. If a political deal is in the interest of all concerned,
the argument goes, it's possible.
</P>
<P>
   That has led to widespread speculation about what Clinton,
Netanyahu, and Arafat have to lose and gain.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, there is clearly more to gain than lose. Whatever
emerges from the meeting, whether a ``framework agreement'' or a
``declaration of principles'' or even just a ``joint statement,''
he will claim success, and both Netanyahu and Arafat will smile and
agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``When an American President gambles,'' Orly Azoulai-Katz wrote
in the newspaper Yediot Ahronot in Israel Friday, ``the entire
administration is mobilized to improve the odds. Working teams
prepare papers and production teams prepare the Rose Garden for the
signing ceremony.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton may be a gambler,'' Azoulai-Katz added, ``but he makes
the rules in his casino.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has more of a risk. Public opinion polls taken by the
newspaper Maariv showed that 82 percent of the Israelis want an
agreement, and if he returns with one he would be deemed a hero.
But he would also face sharp attacks from his right-wing core
constituency, which is opposed to any ceding of land.
</P>
<P>
   If Netanyahu fails, he increases the chances of a crisis down
the line, when the Palestinians proclaim a state, but his political
situation will remain largely the same. The same Maariv poll that
showed overwhelming support for a deal also showed that far fewer
Israelis, 57 percent, support ceding 13 percent more land, and 52
percent believe the Wye talks will fail.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is the one with the most to lose. If he agrees to the
tough Israeli security conditions, he will face tough going among
the Palestinians. If the talks fail, he will likely fall further in
the esteem of his people. Arafat also has the least choice, and
there are rumors that the Americans have promised him new aid if he
comes through.

JAPAN'S PARLIAMENT PASSES $517 BILLION BANK RESCUE PACKAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Japanese Parliament completed passage of a plan
Friday that commits $517 billion worth of taxpayer funds to rescue
the nation's teetering banking system in an attempt to get money
flowing through a crippled economy.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the rescue legislation had been expected, but it was
nonetheless welcomed as marking a conclusion to months of
acrimonious bickering among politicians in Japan. The legislation
had received worldwide attention as officials of other countries
looked to Japan to help avert a global recession.
</P>
<P>
   Along with a second set of newly passed banking laws, the
package is the biggest in a series of bailouts that the governing
Liberal Democratic Party has assembled to stave off a collapse of
Japanese financial institutions _ in a system weakened by hundreds
of billions of dollars in bad debt.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half the rescue money will be used to expand the capital
base at the banks, which have grown reluctant to lend out of fear
that they will not be repaid. A squeeze in credit, despite
record-low interest rates, has deeply hurt many businesses and
aggravated the worst postwar recession in Japan, the world's
second-largest economy.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the rescue funds will be used to guarantee deposits
at financial institutions and to nationalize failed banks. The
portfolios of those institutions will be restructured so that they
may be sold to other stronger banks or simply shut down in an
orderly way.
</P>
<P>
   Although Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's approval ratings have
sunk to between 20 percent and 30 percent, and a political alliance
was hastily assembled to enact the banking rescue, the Liberal
Democrats seem to have solidified some staying power because of the
action.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, if the banking rescue symbolizes the government's new
political will, it also reflects its limits. Even as politicians
and lawmakers called the rescue package a success, many analysts
highlighted its drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the first major legislative victory for one of the
weakest parties in history,'' said Shigenori Okazaki, a political
analyst at Warburg Dillon Read in Tokyo. ``They want to bail out
all the banks, big and small. But now they are in a paradox. The
banks don't want to take the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the biggest challenge the government now faces is to get
banks to take on the taxpayers' money.
</P>
<P>
   Banks worry that managers will be forced to resign and that the
conditions for taking the money will be too stringent. So they are
reluctant to accept bailouts, preferring to try to muddle along as
they have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition, bankers privately express concern over the
intense wrangling with the government that will be necessary for
the rescue to work. Many are skeptical that the scheme will pour
sufficient cash into the pockets of corporations any time soon and
bring about the economic recovery everyone wants.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, analysts say that while the bailout reduces the
possibility of a collapse in the financial system, it is only a
short-term solution and does not address the more protracted
challenge of modernizing the banking system so that it can sustain
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they're doing is throwing paper on the fire,'' said Alicia
Ogawa, banking analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in Tokyo. ``The days
they have left to continue muddling through are limited. I can see
the car is going to hit the wall. And I think that is good. It will
force them to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists and politicians themselves say that it is still too
early to determine whether Japan's misery is finally over and
whether the economy will soon turn around. But at least, they say,
there is a greater sense of urgency among the politicians that was
absent just a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is short,'' said Yuji Tsushima, a member of the
Parliament's lower house and a former Finance Ministry official.
``That's why we have to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do things that will persuade the world market that
Japan's banking system is on the right track,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The capital bases of the banks have dwindled to precarious
levels, so that they have little cushion to absorb losses expected
to arise from loans that are going bad. Even the government has
said that the economy will shrink by 1.8 percent in the year that
ends March 31, 1999, and with bankruptcies soaring with the sinking
economy, the amount of debt that goes bad when those companies
crumble also soars.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers say that despite the record low interest rates _ a key
overnight borrowing rate now stands at one-quarter of a percent _
they do not want to expand their lending at this time because many
companies are facing financial difficulties. If they lend money,
the banks say, they would just be throwing good money after bad.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Democrats are hoping that with a large injection of
capital, the banks would be more inclined to take risks and lend to
companies throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party, the main opposition group, had demanded
that the government order the banks to take public money, for the
sake of the entire financial system, but that demand was not
incorporated into the new law. Yet, party and government officials
have already begun raising the pressure on the top executives of
the banks, in the hopes that infusions of money could begin within
the next couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Banks are supposed to take action voluntarily,'' Obuchi told a
news conference Friday. ``I really hope that they understand the
purpose of the laws and behave appropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the potential problems ahead, Masaru Hayami, the
governor of the Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank, on
Thursday warned once again that the core capital base at the banks
was too small, suggesting that the potential loan losses at some
large banks may exceed the amount of their core capital.
</P>
<P>
   Based on data from the internal findings of the Bank of Japan,
if Japanese banks were as a whole to set aside profits to account
for so-called ``good'' loans that are expected to go bad within
three years, then the amount of their core capital could fall by at
least half.
</P>
<P>
   So it is not surprising that Hayami called upon the banks to
apply for public funds to boost their capital adequacy. The funds
would be injected through the purchase of newly issued common or
preferred shares.
</P>
<P>
   To nationalize failing banks, the government will set up a new
ministerial committee to manage bank failures and to help draft
plans to deal with financial turmoil. The Long-Term Credit Bank,
one of the nation's largest and weakest banks, is expected to be
temporarily nationalized under the rescue plan. The bank could
apply to be put under state control as early as next week.

BUDGET DEAL PUTS CLINTON ON THE REBOUND, AT LEAST FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (Political Column; with CONGRESS-SPEND, CONGRESS-PORN) 
(bl) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here's a quiz to see if you are keeping up with the
head-snapping political swerves in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Was the following said by a congressman in a) praise or b)
condemnation of President Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   ``Now let me tell you, often in our lives, in our personal
lives, we have choices: Do you want instant gratification, or do
you want to do the responsible thing for yourself and your family
and others, for the future?''
</P>
<P>
   If you answered b), you are hopelessly mired in the past of, oh,
two or three days ago, when folks were still talking about a
scandal involving a certain former intern.
</P>
<P>
   The words were said by House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt _ who
has been a sharp critic of Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky
controversy _ to laud the president's rejection of Republican
tax-cut proposals. Gephardt, with other Democrats, had crowded
around Clinton in the Rose Garden on Friday morning to drench him
with praise, like jubilant football players with a tank of
Gatorade.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it was the Republicans who were left Friday to grouse
about their party's standard-bearers. The cause of all this
celebration and consternation, of course, was the budget deal,
which many conservatives declared won on the president's terms.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, backed up by dozens of Democrats, Clinton basked
in the bright sunshine and gave his most rousing campaign speech of
the political year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight days of progress cannot totally erase eight months of
partisanship,'' he said. ``We all know that in those eight months
of partisanship, too many dreams of too many families were
deferred.''
</P>
<P>
   What Clinton on Friday called ``a dizzying week'' in Washington
left some experienced political hands stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this hubbub about a $500 billion bill and `My God, we
saved the environment for you, we saved Social Security,''' said
former Rep. John Anderson, R-Ill., who ran for president as an
independent in 1980, after watching Clinton on television. ``I just
sat there, scratching my head. Here's a guy who was on the canvas,
and he's acting like he's just starting to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Greenstein, a historian and expert on the presidency at
Princeton University, said Clinton had reason for confidence,
having done better than anyone could have expected since Aug. 17,
when he acknowledged an affair with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   He said Clinton had rallied once-panicked Democrats behind him
by playing the budget game skillfully and maintaining his high
public approval ratings. The reversal of political fortune, he
said, was ``full of anomalies and paradoxes _ like who would
imagine a president would be strengthened by being the third person
to have impeachment hearings?''
</P>
<P>
   But, Greenstein said, the president ``seems to have to be in
some extremely adverse situation to really use his formidable
political talents to good effect.''
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton ``gets any weaker,'' wrote political columnist Paul
A. Gigot in Friday's Wall Street Journal, ``Republicans may pass
Hillary's health-care plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Stomach-churning reversals have been a constant of Clinton's
political career. A breakdown in the Mideast peace talks or another
drop in the stock market could make him appear weak again, and the
impeachment inquiry will grind on. For all the Democrats' new-found
bravado, they are unlikely to break the historic pattern of losses
by presidential parties in midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Republicans probably are going to get their act
together enough in the remaining two weeks of the campaign to hang
on,'' said Anderson, a visiting professor at Nova Southeastern
University Law School who analyzed congressional races this year
for the Center for Voting and Democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Clinton appealed urgently to Democrats to go to the
polls, to counteract what is expected to be a larger Republican
turnout. ``Staying home is not a very good option when so much is
riding on a trip to the ballot box,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the cold political reality he faces, Clinton flew
to Chicago on Friday afternoon to appear with Sen. Carol
Moseley-Braun, D-Ill., and raise half a million dollars for Senate
Democrats. Moseley-Braun trails her opponent, who is far better
financed, by as much as 12 points in recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that ``elections are always about tomorrow,'' Clinton
declared that he had a ``different view of a lot of things than
some people'' who live in Washington. ``I tend to evaluate people
based on what they do that affects the lives of people back home,''
he said, as demonstrators protested against him outside.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton rattled off a list of issues that Democrats should run
on, including fixing the Social Security system, rebuilding schools
and raising the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, some aides allowed themselves a bit of
satisfaction at seeing opponents flummoxed, even if briefly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think after the last six years of making the mistake
of counting him out and predicting demise, those who have made a
career out of doing that would take a deep breath,'' said Rahm
Emanuel, a senior adviser who is leaving Clinton's service next
week after seven years.
</P>
<P>
   But Emanuel added that he had developed a maxim during his years
of evaluating instant political reviews. ``You're never as good as
they say you are,'' he said, ``and you're never as bad as they say
you are.''

ANALYSIS: GREENSPAN PLAYS PSYCHOLOGIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also MARKET, ASIA-MARKETS) 
(mk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He is revered in the financial markets these days
as omnipotent and omniscient, but Alan Greenspan, the Federal
Reserve chairman, has not always gotten it right.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the American banking system was seizing up. Many
institutions had been hit hard by losses on real estate loans, and
regulators were demanding that they keep more capital on hand. As a
result, banks became extremely reluctant to lend, and the resulting
credit shortage helped push the economy into recession.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan and his colleagues at the Fed largely missed the
problem, cutting interest rates aggressively to stimulate more
lending only after the economy began to contract. And as he
confronts another credit shortage that could put the nation's long
business expansion at risk, Greenspan is determined not to make the
same mistake again, as evidenced by his unusual decision on
Thursday to cut rates by a quarter percentage point between the
central bank's regularly scheduled policy meetings. Economists now
expect a series of further rate reductions this year and possibly
into next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually the only blemish on Greenspan's record as chairman
was in not acting forcefully enough to offset the 1989-1990 credit
crunch, which was the fundamental cause of the 1990 recession,''
said G. David Orr, an economist at First Union Capital Markets.
``He will not want to be caught in that situation again.''
</P>
<P>
   In acting assertively, Greenspan was trying to break a
psychology within the markets that more bad news was almost
inevitable and that the risks to investors and lenders were only
growing. In doing so, however, he may have had to sidestep
reluctance among some members of the Fed's policy-setting Federal
Open Market Committee who remain concerned that lower rates could
fuel inflation by stimulating an economy that by some measures,
including a very low unemployment rate, is already running hard.
</P>
<P>
   The committee voted just over two weeks ago to cut its federal
funds target rate on overnight lending between banks by a quarter
point, to 5.25 percent, turning aside pressure from the financial
markets and many economists for a half point cut.
</P>
<P>
   That Greenspan then cut rates on Thursday by another quarter
point suggested to many analysts that the Fed chairman had wanted a
half-point cut in the first place, but had not been willing at that
time to force a showdown over the issue with committee members who
still see a potential threat from inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan announced his decision after convening a conference
call among the committee's members early Thursday afternoon. A
spokeswoman for the Fed said no vote was taken and that Greenspan
acted on his own authority, which is routinely granted to him by
the committee but rarely used.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan appears to have had widespread support within the Fed,
since eight of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks requested that
the central bank also reduce the discount rate on their short-term
loans to commercial banks. Among the banks requesting the discount
rate cut was the St. Louis Fed, whose president, William Poole, was
among those most concerned earlier this year about the inflation
risks.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said Greenspan prefers to develop a consensus
before acting. Determined opposition from even one or two members
of the committee, such as Jerry Jordan, president of the Federal
Reserve Bank of Cleveland, who has been concerned that growth in
the money supply is signaling a possible upturn in inflation, would
be enough to give Greenspan pause, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greenspan has been wanting to cut interest rates earlier and
faster, but the inflation hawks on the Federal Open Market
Committee held him back,'' said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at
Norwest Corp., a Minneapolis banking company. ``At the September
meeting Greenspan was able to convince the hawks that the global
situation indeed is dangerous. But at that point the hawks were not
willing to let Greenspan go more than a quarter of a point.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Sohn said, there have been new indications that the
economy is slowing and that inflation remains dormant. Friday, the
Labor Department reported that the Consumer Price Index was
unchanged last month, leaving the inflation rate for the last 12
months at just 1.5 percent. Industrial production fell three-tenths
of a percent in September, the Fed reported Friday. Earlier in the
week the government had reported weakening retail sales and subdued
price increases at the producer level.
</P>
<P>
   ``My belief is that Chairman Greenspan basically called the
members and gave them the appearance of consulting,'' Sohn said.
``But it was clearly more of a formality, especially in light of
the more negative economic numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   In trying to avert a credit shortage, Greenspan is dealing with
market psychology more than a mismatch between demand and supply in
the economy. His decision to cut rates at an unexpected time may
have been calculated to give a maximum boost to the markets, where
fear about recession at home and a further meltdown in the world
financial system has led investors and lenders to shy away from the
merest whiff of risk.
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, at least, the rate cut succeeded on that
score. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped a further 117.40
points Friday after a 330.58-point gain Thursday, and is nearly 12
percent higher than the low of 7,539.07 reached Aug. 31. Broader
market indicators such as the Standard &AMP; Poor's index and Nasdaq
index also ended the week with strong gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Greenspan, ace psychologist, knew his clients needed some
positive reinforcement,'' Orr said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is still too early to know whether interest-rate cuts
will convince investors that high-grade corporate bonds are not so
risky after all, or reassure banks that the business outlook is
sufficiently bright that it is reasonable to provide new loans to
customers. While the Fed has some tools, like the discount rate,
that can directly help to encourage more lending by banks, it can
only indirectly stimulate greater availability of capital in the
financial markets, where most big companies turn for funding.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a report Friday, Robert DiClemente and David Hensley,
economists at Salomon Smith Barney, said that ``new issuance of
investment-grade corporate bonds remains sporadic and hesitant,''
with the volume, at $3.5 billion for the first half of October, far
behind July's $19 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The word from the bond markets, the economists said, is that the
``wounds will be slow to heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has several important factors working in his favor.
The almost total lack of inflation gives him considerable room to
push rates down farther in coming months. When adjusted for
inflation, in fact, the Fed funds target rate is still relatively
high _ about 3 percent. Because the federal government is running a
budget surplus there will be no inflationary pressures from fiscal
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to 1990, Greenspan has also gotten off to a much faster
start in dealing with the evolving problem, said Maury Harris, an
economist at Paine Webber.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Fed started easing rates in the summer of 1990,
43 percent of banks had already tightened lending standards on
loans to small firms, compared with 23 percent last month, Harris
said. Loan growth had already slowed to 1.5 percent by the summer
of 1990, while it was running at a 12.1 percent annual rate in
September. Investment grade bond issuance had fallen 63.1 percent
by August 1990 compared to a year earlier; the decline from
September 1997 to September 1998 was 6.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1990 the bank credit crunch had become more serious than
the current credit situation before the Fed started to let the
investing public and American business leaders know that it was
plugged into the problem and willing to ease,'' Harris said.

CATHOLIC GROUP MAKES DEAL FOR EIGHT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- San Francisco-based Catholic Healthcare West will
buy eight Southern California hospitals from Unihealth of suburban
Burbank for an undisclosed sum, the companies announced.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which will make CHW the third-largest hospital
operator in the Los Angeles market, includes Northridge Hospital
Medical Center, Glendale Memorial Hospital and six others in Los
Angeles and Orange counties.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at CHW said the purchase should be approved by state
regulators within 60 days and, when complete, will give the chain
greater leverage in contracting with physicians and managed care
companies. CHW now owns six hospitals in Southern California,
including St. Vincent Medical Center in Los Angeles. Both CHW and
Unihealth are nonprofit organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Yoshioka, president of Unihealth's medical centers division,
characterized the sale as a merger because half of the hospitals'
existing board members will remain, while half will be new
appointees from CHW. Yoshioka said Unihealth is exiting the Los
Angeles market because of a lack of market share.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look around Southern California, we don't have any
critical mass anywhere in terms of number of hospitals,'' he said.
``This combo is a good strategic fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Unihealth last year sold its CareAmerica managed care and life
insurance divisions to Blue Shield of California for $175 million.
The company will continue to operate a physician management network
in California.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Lott, a vice president at the Healthcare Association of
Southern California hospital trade group, said consolidation of
hospital ownership is increasingly common in California and will
likely accelerate in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We envision throughout California having eight to 12
(hospital) systems dominate the market within the next 10 to 15
years,'' Lott said. ``We see that as the only way to effectively
compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said that using similar leverage, managed care firms have
wrangled unsustainably low prices from hospitals and other health
care providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we hope will happen is that some of the leverage will
return to the provider side of the ledger at the expense of the
payer side of the ledger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While CHW has said it will continue to provide care at the new
hospitals in the tradition of Unihealth, the chain does plan to
limit the availability of reproductive health care, including
in-vitro fertilization and abortion-on-demand procedures. The
hospitals will, however, provide abortions when the life of the
mother is at risk, CHW spokeswoman Joyce Hawthorne said.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the Los Angeles chapter of the National
Organization of Women opposes CHW's purchase of the eight
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view this as the major problem of the end of the '90s,''
said Judith Meuli, vice president of L.A. NOW. ``We're unalterably
opposed to any religious organization taking over our health
organizations that do not supply birth control and reproductive
services.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than register its opposition with regulators, however, the
group can do little to stop the sale, she acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshioka said the hospitals will continue to provide
contraceptive services.

ISRAELI AND PALESTINIAN LEADERS MAKE SLOW PROGRESS IN PEACE TALKS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WYE MILLS, Md. _ Israeli and Palestinian leaders, under the
prodding hand of U.S. officials, are making some progress toward an
interim accord, officials said Friday, but they described the going
as slow and the mistrust as still deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these issues have been politicized for so long,'' one
official said, ``there has to be a lot of clearing of the air.''
</P>
<P>
   The delegations are spending too much time arguing over who
should be in which meetings and why, without always concentrating
on the substance at hand, the official said, in remarks confirmed
by other officials with knowledge of the talks here.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials said they would not come to any agreement
``just to have one,'' while a Palestinian official complained about
the slow pace of the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Yasser Arafat,
the Palestinian leader, together with large delegations of experts
and advisers, are gathered in seclusion at the Wye Conference
Center near here. Under the push of Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and the special envoy Dennis Ross _ with President Clinton
expected to come to help on Saturday _ the two sides are trying to
finish a long overdue agreement under which Israel will withdraw
from another 13 percent of the West Bank in return for specific
Palestinian steps against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest progress was made on the question of security.
George Tenet, the director of central intelligence, joined the
talks Friday to help the two sides work out the U.S. role in
judging the Palestinian security service's effort at combating the
radicals in their midst, like the Hamas movement. An official said
the CIA was critical to begin to dispel the deep Israeli mistrust
of the Palestinian security forces, ``to figure out a way to
validate any Palestinian claims of best efforts at fighting
terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   While both sides have accepted this U.S. role as the best way to
assess Arafat's commitment to battling those who oppose a peace, it
is proving complicated ``to operationalize'' the concept in a
lasting way, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   While the two sides spent the most time discussing security, the
talks advanced on the economic front as well. They concentrated on
the issue of safe passage for Palestinians from the West Bank to
Gaza; the opening of an already built airport in Gaza; and how to
better the lives of Palestinians whose access to jobs in Israel has
been limited.
</P>
<P>
   One official with knowledge of the talks was gloomier,
suggesting that it would be difficult to come to a final agreement
by the end of Sunday, or Monday morning. He described Netanyahu and
Arafat as too fond of haggling over details and principles and not
raising their sights high enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a peace negotiation,'' the official said. ``This is
a real-estate transaction.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Israelis want Arafat to go to war against Hamas and to stop
both public and private ``incitement'' against Israel and Israelis,
while changing the Palestinian charter to delete clauses calling
for Israel's destruction. Israeli officials acknowledge that these
are difficult steps for Arafat, but they say he cannot use ``the
excuse of weakness forever,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Arafat told Netanyahu and Clinton that he hoped
``this will be the Camp David for the Palestinians and the
Israelis,'' whom he called ``cousins,'' an official said _ the
event that finally breaks the back of the main problems between
them.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu was less lofty but clear, saying he had come ``to
reach an agreement that is clear, specific and binding,'' and
promised his best efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The atmospherics of the second day of talks here were good, said
the State Department spokesman, James Rubin. ``It does appear that
there is a better and more constructive and more pragmatic
atmosphere to work on these problems than there had been in the
past,'' he said at Friday's only public briefing for the press.
</P>
<P>
   In what appeared to be a good omen, given the two leaders'
general dislike of one another, Netanyahu telephoned Arafat Friday
morning and invited him over for a conversation. The two men
talked, with a U.S. interpreter, for nearly 90 minutes before a
joint lunch given by Ms. Albright.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, a U.S. invitation to be hosts at a joint Sabbath
dinner was politely declined by Netanyahu, who did not want a
religious meal to be inevitably politicized, an Israeli official
said. The Wye Center has a synagogue for worship.
</P>
<P>
   So the Israelis ate alone and the Americans ate with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Two key Israeli officials, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, will not arrive until later.
Sharon, after visiting Friday with King Hussein of Jordan, who is
ill, at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, is to arrive here on Saturday
night, while Mordechai, who remained in Israel to deal with an
unexplained security issue, will not arrive until Sunday morning.

   CASPER, Wyo. _ Matthew Wayne Shepard, the gay student who was
beaten in the dead of night, tied to a fence and left to die alone,
was mourned at his funeral Friday by 1,000 people, including many
who had never met him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt believed that if he had made one person's life better, he
had succeeded,'' his cousin, the Rev. Anne Kitch, said in a homily
that was carried beyond the packed pews of St. Mark's Episcopal
Church, through a filled parish hall, across the street to a packed
Presbyterian church and across Casper on an AM radio station.
``Judging from the world's response,'' she said, ``Matt will have
made a difference in the lives of thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   As the first snowstorm of the fall blanketed Casper, fresh
flowers filled the red brick church here where Shepard had been
baptized as a teen-ager and where he once wore the white robes of
an Episcopal acolyte.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an image that comes to mind when I reflect on Matt on
that wooden cross rail fence,'' said the Rev. Royce Brown, the
pastor of St. Mark's, in a eulogy. ``I replace that image with that
of another man hung upon a cross. When I concentrate on that man, I
can release the bitterness inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard, a 21-year-old freshman at the University of Wyoming,
had dreamed of working one day for human rights. In death, he has
become a national catalyst for a new drive to guarantee for gay
people the right to physical safety.
</P>
<P>
   His death hit a nerve in the nation this week, eliciting dozens
of candlelight vigils and rallies for tolerance, several statements
of sadness from President Clinton, and a congressional resolution.
Thursday, the House of Representatives passed by voice vote a
resolution that condemned Shepard's killing as ``outrageous'' and
that urged each member of Congress and every U.S. citizen ``to
denounce this outrageous murder of another human being.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the largest rallies, about 1,000 people, including
members of Congress of both parties, gathered on the steps of the
Capitol in Washington to condemn Shepherd's killing and to urge
passage of a federal bill that would add extra penalties to crimes
motivated by a victim's sexual orientation, gender or disability.
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt urged passage of the bill,
leading the crowd in a chant of ``Now! Now! Now.''

<P>
   ``We will never forget the love that the world has shared with
this kind, loving son,'' said Shepherd's father, Dennis, his
father, outside Casper City Hall, as his mother, Judy, stood by,
weeping. He said the family was ``touched beyond measure'' by ``the
thousands of e-mail comments, Web-site messages, phone calls and
cards offering help, consolation, sympathy and support.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the funeral, about a dozen protesters, largely from
Kansas and Texas, waved signs with anti-homosexual messages. But
mourners stood in front of them, singing ``Amazing Grace'' and
holding umbrellas to block the sight of the spectacle from friends
and family members entering the church.
</P>
<P>
   On hearing of the protest, Laramie's City Council held an
emergency meeting Thursday night and unanimously passed an
ordinance banning protests during funerals.
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming Gov. Jim Geringer had warned in advance that anti-gay
protesters were ``just flat not welcome.'' The governor, a
Republican, added, ``What we don't need is a bunch of wingnuts
coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard was born in Casper and attended elementary school,
junior high and several years of high school and college here. With
flags at Casper's public schools flying at half-staff Friday, many
mourners were his old classmates. Others traveled here, one driving
from as far away as New Jersey, out of a sense of solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a pit in my heart and my stomach since I heard
this,'' said Steve Pietrangelo, who drove 300 miles to wait three
hours in cold rain and snow to attend the funeral of a man he never
met. ``I just wanted to pay my respects to him and his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Touching people of all walks of life, Shepard's murder has
elicited calls for tolerance of homosexuals from unexpected
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Wyoming this fall, football players will
wear yellow and green stickers on their helmets in memory of
Shepard. Organizers said that yellow signifies tolerance and green
symbolizes peace. In Casper, a conservative city of 51,000, located
in the heart of Wyoming's oil belt, tolerance has become the
watchword.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prejudice against homosexuals is just as redneck as anti-black
bias,'` The Casper Star-Tribune, Wyoming's largest newspaper, wrote
in its main editorial on Sunday. ``Violence against our homosexual
friends and neighbors has created a most un-American climate of
fear in Wyoming and the rest of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Jason Marsden, the newspaper's political reporter, wrote
lovingly that, ``Matthew Shepard is still my friend, and not just
because we are both members of the loose-knit community of gay
people striving to make our way in this sometimes hostile place
called Wyoming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt was very short and hard to hug,'' Marsden recalled of the
young man who had grown up in Casper. ``But it was worth trying,
because he'd hug you with everything in his little, fragile
frame.''
</P>
<P>
   In a week of spiritual reflection, Aaron Kreifels, the
University of Wyoming freshman who found his battered classmate
Oct. 7, attributed the chance discovery to ``God's plan.''
</P>
<P>
   On that afternoon, Kreifels, an 18-year-old architectural
engineering student, had nearly completed a rigorous six-mile ride
on a mountain bike up and down Cactus Canyon, in public lands east
of Laramie.
</P>
<P>
   Kreifels recalled in an interview Thursday that his only mishap
of the ride, ``I hit this big limestone rock and did one over the
handlebars.''
</P>
<P>
   Dusting himself off and looking around in the fading light of
the day, Kreifels recalled, ``I noticed something out of my eye
that looked like a scarecrow. I walked around the fence, and as I
got closer, I noticed the hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard, his hands bound behind his back with a nylon cord and
tied to a fence post, was lying on the ground, face up,
unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I wonder why I found him alive, if he was going to
die,'' Kreifels reflected, before traveling to spend this weekend
at home with his parents in Grand Island, Neb. ``But I guess God
wanted his parents to be with him.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here's a quiz to see if you are keeping up with the
head-snapping political swerves in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Was the following said by a congressman in a) praise or b)
condemnation of President Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   ``Now let me tell you, often in our lives, in our personal
lives, we have choices: Do you want instant gratification, or do
you want to do the responsible thing for yourself and your family
and others, for the future?''
</P>
<P>
   If you answered b), you are hopelessly mired in the past of, oh,
two or three days ago, when folks were still talking about a
scandal involving a certain former intern.
</P>
<P>
   The words were said by House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt _ who
has been a sharp critic of Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky
controversy _ to laud the president's rejection of Republican
tax-cut proposals. Gephardt, with other Democrats, had crowded
around Clinton in the Rose Garden on Friday morning to drench him
with praise, like jubilant football players with a tank of
Gatorade.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it was the Republicans who were left Friday to grouse
about their party's standard-bearers. The cause of all this
celebration and consternation, of course, was the budget deal,
which many conservatives declared won on the president's terms.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, backed up by dozens of Democrats, Clinton basked
in the bright sunshine and gave his most rousing campaign speech of
the political year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight days of progress cannot totally erase eight months of
partisanship,'' he said. ``We all know that in those eight months
of partisanship, too many dreams of too many families were
deferred.''
</P>
<P>
   What Clinton on Friday called ``a dizzying week'' in Washington
left some experienced political hands stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this hubbub about a $500 billion bill and `My God, we
saved the environment for you, we saved Social Security,''' said
former Rep. John Anderson, R-Ill., who ran for president as an
independent in 1980, after watching Clinton on television. ``I just
sat there, scratching my head. Here's a guy who was on the canvas,
and he's acting like he's just starting to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Greenstein, a historian and expert on the presidency at
Princeton University, said Clinton had reason for confidence,
having done better than anyone could have expected since Aug. 17,
when he acknowledged an affair with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   He said Clinton had rallied once-panicked Democrats behind him
by playing the budget game skillfully and maintaining his high
public approval ratings. The reversal of political fortune, he
said, was ``full of anomalies and paradoxes _ like who would
imagine a president would be strengthened by being the third person
to have impeachment hearings?''
</P>
<P>
   But, Greenstein said, the president ``seems to have to be in
some extremely adverse situation to really use his formidable
political talents to good effect.''
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton ``gets any weaker,'' wrote political columnist Paul
A. Gigot in Friday's Wall Street Journal, ``Republicans may pass
Hillary's health-care plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Stomach-churning reversals have been a constant of Clinton's
political career. A breakdown in the Mideast peace talks or another
drop in the stock market could make him appear weak again, and the
impeachment inquiry will grind on. For all the Democrats' new-found
bravado, they are unlikely to break the historic pattern of losses
by presidential parties in midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Republicans probably are going to get their act
together enough in the remaining two weeks of the campaign to hang
on,'' said Anderson, a visiting professor at Nova Southeastern
University Law School who analyzed congressional races this year
for the Center for Voting and Democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Clinton appealed urgently to Democrats to go to the
polls, to counteract what is expected to be a larger Republican
turnout. ``Staying home is not a very good option when so much is
riding on a trip to the ballot box,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the cold political reality he faces, Clinton flew
to Chicago on Friday afternoon to appear with Sen. Carol
Moseley-Braun, D-Ill., and raise half a million dollars for Senate
Democrats. Moseley-Braun trails her opponent, who is far better
financed, by as much as 12 points in recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that ``elections are always about tomorrow,'' Clinton
declared that he had a ``different view of a lot of things than
some people'' who live in Washington. ``I tend to evaluate people
based on what they do that affects the lives of people back home,''
he said, as demonstrators protested against him outside.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton rattled off a list of issues that Democrats should run
on, including fixing the Social Security system, rebuilding schools
and raising the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, some aides allowed themselves a bit of
satisfaction at seeing opponents flummoxed, even if briefly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think after the last six years of making the mistake
of counting him out and predicting demise, those who have made a
career out of doing that would take a deep breath,'' said Rahm
Emanuel, a senior adviser who is leaving Clinton's service next
week after seven years.
</P>
<P>
   But Emanuel added that he had developed a maxim during his years
of evaluating instant political reviews. ``You're never as good as
they say you are,'' he said, ``and you're never as bad as they say
you are.''

GOVERNMENT MAY FILE SUIT TO BLOCK NORTHWEST-CONTINENTAL DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has raised objections to Northwest
Airlines' bid to buy a controlling stake in Continental Airlines
and may file suit to block the deal as early as Monday, a person
briefed on the government's plans said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But representatives of Northwest, Continental and the investor
group that holds the controlling stake in Continental plan to
negotiate with lawyers from the Justice Department's antitrust
division over the weekend and could reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to say when Monday dawns where this will be,'' said
another person involved.
</P>
<P>
   A government lawsuit would threaten a deal that has been the
major catalyst for the consolidation of the domestic airline
industry since it was announced earlier this year, though Northwest
and Continental could challenge the government in court.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Northwest beat rival Delta Air Lines and agreed to
buy an equity stake representing 51 percent of Continental's voting
stock from Air Partners, an investment group run by David
Bonderman, for $300 million and 4.1 million shares of Northwest
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest and Continental, the country's fourth- and
fifth-largest carriers, plan to combine route networks in a
strategic alliance while keeping their fleets, managements and
employees separate _ an arrangement they call a ``virtual merger.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal sent the other major domestic airlines scurrying for
partners to expand their networks for fear of losing lucrative
business passengers to the new Northwest-Continental alliance. In
April, No. 1 United Airlines agreed to join forces with No. 3 Delta
Air Lines, and American Airlines, the second-largest carrier,
paired with No. 6 US Airways.
</P>
<P>
   The alliances inflamed fears that the major airlines have become
too powerful, choking off competition from smaller carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Transportation Department proposed
guidelines designed to prevent major carriers from preying on
smaller, discount carriers. Several bills were introduced in
Congress to promote more airline competition.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Northwest and Continental believe the Justice
Department's objections reflect the growing concerns at the
Department of Transportation and in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are acutely conscious of what is going on in the industry
and do not want to allow all-out consolidation, or maybe start a
trend that would lead that way,'' said a third person following the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Justice Department's antitrust division
declined to comment Friday, as did spokesmen from Northwest,
Continental and Air Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting in Washington earlier this week, Justice Department
lawyers told Northwest they were not comfortable with the carrier's
proposal to buy a controlling stake in Continental. The Justice
Department also raised objections about the strategic alliance,
said several people briefed on the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest had already proposed placing the Continental shares in
a voting trust controlled by independent Continental directors,
though it would retain the right to vote the shares if there were a
takeover bid. The trust would expire after six years, giving
Northwest control.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the government, Northwest, Continental and
Air Partners met again on Friday in an attempt to negotiate a
solution that would allow the deal to go forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the home stretch here,'' said one person. ``There are
some issues. They will either get worked out or they won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Northwest believes it has a strong case because its routes have
little overlap with Continental's. Moreover, the government may not
want to wage another high-profile antitrust case at a time when its
resources are already tied up in major cases against Microsoft
Corp. and Visa and Mastercard.

MOB INFILTRATES LAS VEGAS SEX INDUSTRY VIA HIGH TECH, U.S. SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev., Fla., N.Y., N.J.)   (bl)  
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ In a case of the oldest profession meeting the
newest technology, a federal indictment handed down Oct. 9 suggests
that the mob is muscling its way into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents arrested six men here Oct. 9 after surveillance
indicated that the men intended to harm several operators of adult
entertainment businesses that openly front for prostitution. Agents
stumbled on the plot, the indictment says, because the intended
victims were themselves targets of a federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, the men are members of the Gambino
crime family who were pressuring a computer expert to
systematically divert telephone calls from one or more adult
entertainment enterprises to competing companies affiliated with
the mob.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1990s operators of adult entertainment companies
known as out-call services have attributed a mysterious decline in
the number of calls from customers to computer criminals who gain
access to the local phone company's switches and illegally reroute
calls to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Although prostitution is illegal in Las Vegas and surrounding
Clark County, nude dancing services in which a male or female
entertainer is sent to a hotel room are legal. Prostitution is
legal in some counties in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are no reliable estimates of the size of the sex
industry in Las Vegas, the Yellow Pages carry 134 pages of
advertising in the category of ``adult entertainers,'' one of the
directory's largest categories.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said that among the six men who were arrested
were two mob enforcers who had flown to Las Vegas from Tampa, Fla..
They said that the arrests were made after agents became convinced
that the lives of several people were at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The two alleged enforcers, Vincent Congiusti and Anton Nelsen,
came to Las Vegas to threaten three operators of out-call nude
dancing services, according to the indictment. The men were
arrested when they began looking for Charles Coveney, who is
described in the indictment as a computer expert who worked for one
of the adult entertainment services.
</P>
<P>
   Coveney did not return repeated calls requesting comment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Congiusti, 48, and Nelsen, whose age was not
given, agents arrested Christiano DeCarlo, the 27-year-old owner of
the DeCarlo Group, an adult entertainment business in Las Vegas;
Kenneth Byrnes, 38, described as an enforcer from New Jersey, and
Joshua Snellings, 20, of Las Vegas, a driver for DeCarlo. A sixth
man, Mario Stefano, believed to be a Gambino operative, was
arrested in New York City on Oct. 12.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The indictment quotes Stefano as telling an undercover agent
that he was irritated by several of the out-call services that
compete with DeCarlo, and that ``a couple of aspirins will be sent
to Las Vegas to deal with those headaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Congiusti's mob name is ``Vinnie Aspirins.'' The indictment also
quotes Stefano as stating that on one occasion Congiusti used a
cordless drill to bore holes in the head of a man who had crossed
the mob. According to the indictment, the FBI agents who arrested
Congiusti found a power drill in the Ford Expedition he was
traveling in at the time of the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The other alleged enforcer, Nelsen, is known as ``Angel of
Mercy.'' He is described in the indictment as a former mercenary
soldier who is an expert in explosives. FBI agents said that they
had observed Nelson purchasing carburetor cleaner in an automobile
parts store and that they believed he intended to use it to build a
fire bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hilda Brauer, an owner of the Perfect Body's and the
Young and Sexy Bodies nude-dancing services, sued Sprint Corp. and
R.H. Donnelley, publisher of the Las Vegas Yellow Pages, charging
that they had conspired to systematically divert phone calls from
her business.
</P>
<P>
   Although the suit was dismissed, the accusations appear to have
drawn the attention of federal agencies. Several adult services
operators, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that in
the last year federal agents had created an interagency computer
crimes task force based in Reno to investigate the accusations of
call diversion. One of the service operators said he believed that
call diversions had spread beyond the adult entertainment business
and were becoming a growing problem for other Las Vegas businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials in Las Vegas said they were familiar with the
reports of electronic telephone call diversion but for the time
being were focusing on other charges, including suspected payoffs
to local law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a super big business here,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney
Eric Johnson said of sex services. ``These operators generate a lot
of money and a lot of cash.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charges that a significant portion of the Las
Vegas out-call industry is a front for money laundering, robbery,
narcotics distribution and other criminal activities, in addition
to prostitution.

   Federal agents believe that La Cosa Nostra crime syndicate is
trying to grab control of the sex industry through threats,
extortion and other illegal means, including sophisticated
rerouting of calls from competitors' businesses.

   The man agreed to assist the FBI by allowing an undercover agent
to be placed in his business.

   During an Oct. 5 meeting in New York City, the indictment
states, Stefano advised the undercover agent and the informer that
he was sending two men from Tampa to assist Byrnes in threatening

   The defendants face charges of conspiracy, extortion and
interstate travel in aid of racketeering.

SMITH SAVORS RUNNING REVIVAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ For much of the past two seasons, critics have
pointed to Soldier Field and the sight of Cowboys running back
Emmitt Smith being carted off on a stretcher as the beginning of
his decline.
</P>
<P>
   Smith will return to Chicago tomorrow for the first time since
that 1996 season opener. And he'll be stoked with the knowledge
that the scary incident _ in which he suffered a bruised neck and
back after diving over a pile in the fourth quarter _ and talk of
his decline are in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to say I told you so,'' Smith said. ``I already knew
what I could do. It's you doubters out there that seem to be
surprised about what's going on. I felt all along that things were
going to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   And better they have gotten. Smith leads the NFC in rushing with
529 yards and is third in the NFL. At this pace, Smith will finish
the season with 1,408 yards, his best since rushing for 1,773 in
1995. His 1,074 yards last season were his lowest output since his
rookie year.
</P>
<P>
   Along with giving credit to the improved offensive line, Smith
said coach Chan Gailey's offense has made a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have certain plays that lend to a bunch of options, and you
have plays that are reverse to the way we ran them in the past,''
Smith said. ``The difference is my technique is different, and my
whole thought process is different from what it was in the past.
That right there has allowed me to be a better runner.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said Smith will be better when he understands the offense
fully and starts anticipating where holes are going to be.
</P>
<P>
   Although he wants to add another NFL rushing title to his mantel
(he has four), Smith said that it's early, and that winning is more
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean a hill of beans,'' Smith said. ``If I was
there at the end of the season, it would be different. The most
important goals are team goals. If we reach the playoffs and go to
the Super Bowl, everything is going to be sweet. Once you get to
the Super Bowl, no one really cares whether you won the rushing
title.'' Smith and Davis practice Receiver Billy Davis (sprained
left foot) and Smith (strained left hip) practiced yesterday for
the first time this week, and Gailey expressed confidence that both
might be ready for the Bears game Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Both will be game-time decisions. If Davis plays, it's unlikely
that he will start. Ernie Mills will probably start in Davis' spot
because Mills had more practice time this week.

INCREASE IN SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS TO BE LOWEST SINCE '87 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;    (mk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Social Security benefits will rise 1.3 percent next
year, the government announced Friday. That would be the smallest
cost-of-living increase since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   More than 44 million Americans receive such benefits. Most are
elderly, but about 30 percent are under the age of 65.
</P>
<P>
   The increase is small because inflation, as measured by the
Consumer Price Index, has been exceptionally low.
</P>
<P>
   The Commissioner of Social Security, Kenneth Apfel, said the
average monthly Social Security check for retired workers would
rise next year by $10, to $780. For an elderly couple, both
receiving benefits, the average check will rise by $17, to $1,310.
</P>
<P>
   Benefits in a number of other programs are also tied to the
Consumer Price Index. The maximum monthly payment for 6.6 million
low-income individuals receiving Supplemental Security Income will
rise to $500, from $494.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate announcement, the Department of Health and Human
Services said that the monthly Medicare premium would rise next
year to $45.50. For the last two years, it has been fixed at
$43.80.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare premiums are deducted from monthly Social Security
checks. The premiums are recalculated each year to reflect changes
in health care costs and Medicare law.
</P>
<P>
   The spending habits of retirees obviously differ from those of
younger people. But Henry Aaron, an economist at the Brookings
Institution, said there was no conclusive evidence that living
costs were rising much faster for the elderly than for other
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Some research using experimental price indexes for the elderly
suggests that the inflation rate for older consumers may be
slightly higher than the overall rate, but the difference appears
to be very small.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, many Social Security recipients are under 65. Of
the more than 44 million people who receive Social Security, 27.3
million are retirees, 3.4 million are dependents of retired workers
and 7.4 million are survivors of workers who have died. In
addition, 4.6 million disabled workers and 1.6 million of their
dependents get Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of Retired Persons pointed out that
medical costs were rising faster than most consumer prices, and
that elderly people, on the average, spend 19 percent of their
income on health care and health insurance. Thus, the association
said, Congress should be wary of proposals to reduce the
cost-of-living adjustment as part of any program to revamp and
preserve Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Corry, director of federal affairs at the association,
said: ``For the vast majority of Social Security beneficiaries, the
cost-of-living adjustment is the only source of retirement income
that is indexed for inflation. Changes in the cost-of-living
adjustment and the Consumer Price Index should be last on the list
of possible options for savings in Social Security. Such changes
have a disproportionate effect on low- and moderate-income people,
and on the oldest of the old.''
</P>
<P>
   The indexing of federal benefit programs has been criticized on
the ground that it tends to increase federal spending. But the
Congressional Research Service said the 1972 law that authorized
automatic increases in Social Security, linked to the Consumer
Price Index, was sought mainly by conservatives, ``as a means of
curbing even larger ad hoc benefit increases'' approved by Congress
in prior years.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists have said that the Consumer Price Index
overstates the cost of living. The federal Bureau of Labor
Statistics is making changes in the index in an effort to fix that
problem.

 &HT;    Toombs star may commit to Dogs
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia is expected to receive its fifth verbal
commitment, from Toombs County quarterback/defensive back Vince
Faison, widely regarded as one of the state's top-five prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Faison, a 5-foot-11, 185-pound native of Lyons, is expected to
make his commitment official at Georgia's homecoming date against
Vanderbilt in Athens today. Faison, ranked the No. 15 athlete
nationally by SuperPrep, also considered Georgia Tech, Clemson,
South Carolina and N.C. State.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Faison had more than 1,700 all-purpose yards and
scored 22 touchdowns. On defense, he had 10 interceptions,
including three returned for scores.
</P>
<P>
   Faison also is considered a top prospect in baseball and could
be a high-round pick in June's amateur draft. He hit .356 with two
homers and 19 stolen bases as a center fielder last year. Faison is
an academic full-qualifier with a 3.86 GPA and 970 score on the
SAT.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to sign with a college and wait until June to see
where I go in the draft,'' Faison said earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Faison would join Georgia commitments Josh Billue of
Guntersville, Ala., Robert Brannon of Charlotte, Kentrell Curry of
Stephens County and Shedrick Wynn of Lincoln County.

 &HT;    Tech wants to halt second-half slides
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Tech hits this stretch every year.
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Jackets have started 4-1 each of the past two seasons
only to fall apart in the second half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a 38-0 loss to Florida State, a 16-13 loss to North
Carolina, followed by a 35-31 loss to Virginia, nearly cost Tech a
bowl bid. In 1996, the Yellow Jackets played Virginia, Clemson and
Florida State in four weeks, lost two of those three and five of
the last six, and missed a bowl trip.
</P>
<P>
   Tech is knee-deep in it again, with _ Boom! N.C. State _ Boom!
Virginia _ Boom! Florida State. But this time it might be
different, both in attitude and result. With a win over then-No. 23
N.C. State last week, Tech has some momentum for No. 7 Virginia
today. The two teams are tied for first in the ACC with 3-0
records.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Tech gets the two toughest games _ Virginia and FSU _ at
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we can win games we're not supposed to win,'' junior
quarterback Joe Hamilton said. ``Going into the preseason before
Boston College, I think there was a sense of confidence, but I
think it was a false confidence. We weren't as good as we thought
we were. Now, it's a real confidence that we can do things, no
matter who we're playing. My first year here and my second, I don't
think we really believed that. Now, I'm hearing around if we
practice hard we can beat anybody in the conference. We're ready
for this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach George O'Leary has talked about playing 11 one-game
seasons. Five down, one to go. It's cliche, but his players appear
to be buying into the thinking behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we were talking about other teams before we should
have,'' senior defensive end Jesse Tarplin said. ``If we don't beat
Virginia, the Florida State game doesn't mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   More than the words they are using, Tech players might be
feeding off their experience of going through the last two
midseason disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``(After a 4-1 start) my sophomore year, we were all talking
about what bowl game we were going to,'' Tarplin said. ``Last year,
we barely made a bowl game. We lost our focus a little bit. This
year, everybody is keeping their focus. There hasn't been any talk
about what bowl we're going to go to, only the next game. As coach
O'Leary says, we've only got one shot at this team.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary said he hasn't been doing much talking about the
importance of the game; he figures his team already knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need to say much,'' he said. ``I think the heat is
turned up a little bit. What good teams do, the heat doesn't bother
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia has dealt with some second-half adversity of its own.
In the 1990s, the Cavaliers have gone 33-7 in the first five games
of the season, 29-25-1 the rest of the way. At 5-0, 3-0 in the ACC,
the Cavaliers are going for their best start since opening 6-0 in
1990. That streak ended with a loss to Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1996, we went down there 4-0 in a similar situation and
they came out with a big win (13-7),'' Virginia All-America safety
Anthony Poindexter said. ``We don't want that same thing this year.
... It's an ACC game, both of us are ranked, both of us are
undefeated in the conference, which makes the game even more
important. The stakes are high.

`HURRICANE BOWL' ON UCLA'S AGENDA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UCLA could make college football history this season. The Bruins
could wind up playing in two bowls.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the school announced it has agreed to reschedule its
game at Miami for Dec. 5. The game was originally scheduled for
Sept. 26 but was postponed because of Hurricane Georges.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins coach Bob Toledo joked this week that his team would
refer to the game as the ``Hurricane Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   But for UCLA, the game will be a serious test. Also, it could
provide the final boost into the real bowl that the top teams are
aiming at _ the Fiesta Bowl, site of this season's national
championship on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   When the UCLA-Miami game was postponed, it appeared that it
might not be rescheduled. UCLA, in particular seemed reluctant to
play a game after its traditional season-ending game with Southern
California. And with Dec. 5 the only available date, the
rescheduled game wreaks havoc with recruiting and academics.
</P>
<P>
   But for Miami, the home game in the Orange Bowl is worth about
$700,000. And the Hurricanes want to play their entire schedule so
that they can enhance their chances at winning the required number
of games to qualify for a bowl.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA is ranked second in the nation behind Ohio State. If the
season ends with those teams atop the polls and the Bowl
Championship Series rankings, they'll meet in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA had no choice but to agree to reschedule the Miami game. If
they had declined to play despite Miami's insistence, it would
appear the Bruins were hiding behind a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with that extra game, the Bruins are taking a calculated
risk. If they win the rest of their games _ and the Pacific-10
Conference isn't without challengers _ they could take a 10-0
record to Miami.

   A loss there could knock them out of the title picture. A
victory could be the final step for a trip to the Fiesta Bowl. Also
on Dec. 5, No. 3 Tennessee figures to be playing in the
Southeastern Conference title game. If not for the trip to Miami,
the Bruins would spend that day sitting at home and fretting over
the Volunteers leapfrogging them in the polls and rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be sitting back in December being mad at
ourselves because the game slipped away and we're in the Rose
Bowl,'' offensive tackle Kris Farris said. ``I never thought the
Rose Bowl would be second-best. But to be that close \Rto the
Fiesta Bowl\S and not obtain our goal is terrifying.''
 &LR; tagtop:Wendell Barnhouse, (817) 390-7238
Rose-colored glasses
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State is No. 1. UCLA is No. 2. If both finish the season
undefeated, they'll play in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 4. And if that
happens, everyone will say the Rose Bowl made a bad deal.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Well, if it wasn't for the Rose joining the Bowl
Championship Series, it would have staged its only national
championship party with the Big Ten Conference champion (Ohio
State) facing the Pacific-10 Conference champion (UCLA).
</P>
<P>
   The Rose has been the traditional destination for those two
conference champions. But the last time the game in Pasadena had
No. 1 vs. No. 2 was 1969 (Ohio State vs. Southern California). If
the Fiesta winds up with the Buckeyes vs. the Bruins, the Rose Bowl
committee members will keep a stiff upper lip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some local people will think we made a bad deal,''
said Harriman Cronk, Rose Bowl committee chairman. ``By the same
token, we've given the public what it wants, we've given the
\Rcollege\S presidents what they want and we've given the coaches
from the two conferences what they want. What else can I say?''
</P>
<P>
   As compensation for losing their traditional matchup, the Rose
gets first choice of the available teams. That could mean a Notre
Dame-Nebraska matchup. Or, if Wisconsin and Kansas State finish
unbeaten but are not Fiesta-worthy, the Rose could stage its own
ersatz championship game.
Backup backup plan
</P>
<P>
   There was a 45-minute power outage at Sun Devil Stadium during
last Saturday's Notre Dame-Arizona State game. That's the bad news.
The good news is that the blown transformer provided a wakeup call
for the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the site of the national championship game will be ready if
another blackout occurs on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it was kind of a fluke thing,'' Fiesta Bowl spokesman
Shawn Schoeffler said. ``We also think it was a wakeup call. We
have now prepared for that for Jan. 4. We have backup plans for
backup plans.''
Curses
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern followed its 10-2 Rose Bowl season in 1995 with a
9-3 record and Citrus Bowl appearance in 1996. But last season, the
Wildcats were 5-7 and they're 2-4 going into today's game with
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   There might be a reasonable explanation for the school's slide.
That is, if you believe in curses and hexes.
</P>
<P>
   Before last season, Northwestern changed the name of its home
field from Dyche Stadium to Ryan Field. The new name honored a
big-bucks contributor whose donations had helped refurbish the
facility.
</P>
<P>
   To protest the name change, George Beres, a Northwestern
graduate and former sports information director at the school, put
a curse on the school. He stood outside the stadium last summer,
plucked the petals off a long-stemmed rose and repeated this
phrase: ``Northwestern will not return to the Rose Bowl until the
name `Dyche Stadium' is reinstated.''
Meaningful victory
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's 26-24 victory against Northwestern had special
meaning for Iowa junior quarterback Randy Reiners. He returned as
the Hawkeyes' starter and passed for 249 yards and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Reiners, who has overcome major knee surgery, lost the starting
job to Kyle McCann after the second game. At the time, he was
trying to recover from the death of his older sister Natalie. She
died of complications from a brain hemorrhage suffered during a
pickup softball game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear that his mind wasn't completely on football not
too long ago,'' Iowa coach Hayden Fry said.
</P>
<P>
   But his return to the starting lineup and his performance helped
ease some of Reiners' anguish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big boost,'' said Reiners' father, Gary. ``We needed
something positive to happen. For him, too.''
In quotes
</P>
<P>
   Virginia safety Anthony Poindexter on being the homecoming
opponent for today's game at Georgia Tech:
</P>
<P>
   ``You're supposed to schedule a lesser opponent than yourselves,
someone you think you can beat. That just shows a lack of respect.
We'll go down there and earn our respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State quarterback Terrance Bryant is from Miami, Fla. He
played at a San Francisco junior college before going to Oregon
State:
</P>
<P>
   ``I went from Miami where they had hurricanes to the Bay Area
where they had earthquakes. In Corvallis all you have is rain, and
you can survive that.''
</P>
<P>
   Illinois coach Ron Turner after the Illini's fourth consecutive
loss to Ohio State (the scores: 41-3, 48-0, 41-6, 41-0):
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was the owner of a pro team, I'd have about eight scouts
\Rat Ohio State\S right now.''
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska is 11th nationally in rushing, averaging 237.8 yards a
game. The last time the Huskers' season rushing average was in that
range was 1976 when the 9-3-1 team averaged just under 220 a game.
Since then, Nebraska has finished under 300 yards per game twice _
287 in 1993 and 291 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Bowl Championship Series will release its computer-enhanced
standings beginning Oct. 26 and will continue through Dec. 6. The
original plan was to release the rankings starting Nov. 15.
However, BCS officials were being deluged with questions from
commissioners and athletic administrators, so the date was moved
up.
</P>
<P>
   Since throwing six interceptions in a loss to North Carolina
State, Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke has attempted 143
consecutive passes without an interception.
</P>
<P>
   Last year under defensive coordinator Rex Ryan (now at
Oklahoma), Cincinnati allowed 233 points. This year, the Bearcats
are 0-6 and have allowed 300 points. The record for most points
allowed in a season is 553, set last season by Southwestern
Louisiana.

 &HT;    Yanks, Padres series promises to be a dramatic World Series
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like the two cities they represent, the Padres and
Yankees seem a continent apart.
</P>
<P>
   But a closer look at this World Series matchup shows, as one New
York daily pointed out in a headline Friday, ``Enough connections
to bridge a continent.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many mini-dramas.
</P>
<P>
   Game 1 Yankees starter David Wells grew up in San Diego. Padres
jack-of-all- trades Jim Leyritz was a Series hero for the Yankees
in 1996.Hideki Irabu refused to play for the Padres, and the
Yankees traded Ruben Rivera to San Diego for him. Greg Vaughn was a
Yankee for several hours last year before failing a physical.
Sterling Hitchcock, the league championship MVP pitched for the
Yankees for three years. Padres reliever Brian Boehringer pitched
for the Yankees, and Shane Spencer grew up outside San Diego, and
Yankees bench coach Don Zimmer managed the Padres and ...
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of good stories out there about these guys,''
Leyritz said. ``It's going to be emotional. I think this is going
to be a special thing for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Special, indeed. Unlike last October, when some fans considered
the Indians-Marlins matchup unappetizing, this series could be a
dandy. Arguably, the two best pitchers in baseball right now _
Kevin Brown and David Wells _ face each other in Game 1. Wells has
helped pile on the hype. On Thursday, his loose tongue predicted
that the Yanks would win in five games. He came back Friday and
said his quotes were taken out of context. ``I told nobody I was
predicting everything,'' he said. ``Whoever wrote it, they had fun
with it. So be it.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Series sets to open at Yankee Stadium, tickets already
are being priced as high as $2,500, and the subways are filled with
trash-talking fans of the Bronx Bomber. The Yankees, with an
AL-record 114 regular-season victories, are making their 35th
Series trip, and they will go down as one of the great teams of all
time if they win.
</P>
<P>
   For the Padres, it is only the club's second trip in its 30-year
history. San Diego lost to Detroit in five games in 1984 after
knocking off the Cubs in the NL Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been underdogs every time (this year),'' Leyritz said,
``and we are still underdogs in this series, and we look forward to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But that underdog tag means nothing now. The Padres have
defeated two clubs _ 100-game winners Houston and Atlanta _ much
handier than the Yankees have knocked off their postseason victims.
The Yankees beat the Rangers and struggled with the Indians. The
Padres also are 4-1 on the road this postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the Padres are a very good club,'' Yankees manager Joe
Torre said. ``They are playing with a lot of confidence. They
overcame a lot of things to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Padres manager Bruce Bochy said, ``Sometimes it is nice going in
as underdogs, because people don't quite expect as much of you.''
</P>
<P>
   The first game of any short series is important, but tonight
seems more important than most. For the Yankees to win the Series,
they probably need Wells to carry them. The same with Brown for the
Padres. ``Look at what they did to Atlanta,'' Wells said about San
Diego. ``Atlanta was supposed to be one of the best teams in
baseball, which I think they are, but they got beat by a team that
they didn't think was going to beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, the pressure is all on the Yankees, a 3-to-1 Las Vegas
favorite. They are supposed to win: They are the team that has won
121 games this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as legitimizing our season,'' Torre said, ``I hate to
even think in negative terms, but if San Diego happens to win the
World Series, sure it takes a little bit of luster off what we have
accomplished by getting here.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre says the Series reminds him of 1996, when he was facing
Atlanta, which came in the favorite but lost to the Yankees. Now,
Torre is playing the role of the Braves and the Padres his Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that we had a chance to beat Atlanta in '96,'' he
said, ``and I am sure that is the way the Padres feel right now _
that maybe other people are predicting a lot of them, but I am sure
they are for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   As for that Wells prediction that he now says he never made?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am going to predict anything, I'd rather predict it in
four, not five,'' he said. ``Why go five?''
</P>
<P>
   Expect it to go longer than that.

TEXAS TECH FINDS HIDDEN TREASURES IN RESERVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before every home game, members of the Texas Tech football team
follow the Masked Rider onto the playing surface at Jones Stadium.
Dressed in black and cloaked in anonymity, the mounted horseman
also makes celebratory sprints after Tech touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   A school tradition since 1953, the mascot serves as a perfect
symbol for a football team off to its best start in 22 years. Every
week, it seems, a different Red Raiders player steps forward after
an injury to one of the starters.
</P>
<P>
   Cloaked in anonymity, the reserve makes a game-turning play that
lifts the team to victory and causes fans to wonder, ``Who was that
masked man?'' The formula has worked well enough to carry No. 22
Tech (6-0, 3-0) to the top of the Big 12 South Division standings
heading into its 12:30 p.m. battle today against No. 19 Colorado
(5-1, 2-1) in Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, coach Spike Dykes would prefer to stop relying
so heavily on the contributions of his reserves. But he can't
imagine where the Red Raiders would be without them. A 6-0 record,
he suggested, would not have been imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, I'm surprised where we are ... based on all the
different faces we've had in there. Some of those guys have played
above their heads,'' said Dykes, who has seen 11 starters or top
reserves miss a combined 22 games because of injury. ``It's been
one of the most gallant efforts I've seen out of a lot of guys who
haven't played all that much. If they were great players, they'd be
starting. But they're not. They're overachievers, and they've
really lifted this team.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent example came in last week's 24-17 victory
against Oklahoma State. Dorian Pitts, making his first start at
strong-side linebacker in place of injured Ty Ardoin, blocked a
punt to set up a second-quarter touchdown that gave Tech a 14-10
lead. In the fourth quarter, he returned a fumble 53 yards for the
game-winning score.
</P>
<P>
   Dykes credited Pitts with making ``the biggest plays in the
game.'' Oklahoma State coach Bob Simmons credited him with
something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blocked punt changed the momentum of the game,'' Simmons
said. ``We didn't have a breakdown. The Tech player just took more
pride in getting there than our guy did in stopping him.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons' praise landed on the shoulders of Pitts. But his words
could summarize the secret of Tech's success, said offensive guard
Lance Williams, a redshirt freshman from Arlington Bowie High
School.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some depth and everybody can play. We take a lot of
pride in that,'' said Williams, who made his first career start
last week in place of injured Curtis Lowery and is expected to play
against Colorado. ``It makes practices more intense. This week,
Curtis is still hurt, so the rest of us have to step it up. It's
been like that all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Significant contributions have come from unlikely sources. When
quarterback Rob Peters suffered shoulder and thumb injuries in the
season opener, fifth-year senior Matt Tittle rallied the team to a
35-3 victory against UT-El Paso and posted a 4-0 record as a
starter until Peters reclaimed the job. Heading into the season,
Tittle had completed one pass for 7 yards in his college career.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and Justin Collingsworth were among four reserve
offensive linemen who played the brunt of the Baylor game when
injuries felled all starters but left tackle Jonathan Gray. Tech
produced a season-high 538 yards in a 31-29 victory.
</P>
<P>
   With weakside linebacker Kevin McCullar sidelined the past three
weeks by an ankle injury, replacement Tim Duffie has emerged as one
of the team leaders in tackles. Duffie, a junior, has 37 tackles,
one sack, one forced fumble and one fumble recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries have not been the only conduit into the lineup for
newcomers. Freshman Kevin Curtis, the only member of Tech's 1998
signing class who is not being redshirted, has played well enough
in spot duty at free safety (15 tackles, one pass breakup) to allow
starter John Norman to take breathers before and after kick
returns. Norman ranks among the national leaders in kickoff returns
(35.8 yard average) and punt returns (12.6 average).
</P>
<P>
   Joining Norman as starters in the secondary are two former
walk-ons, Reagan Bownds and Oscar Solis. Bownds, who has 44 tackles
and two interceptions, won a starting berth with his solid play at
rover while Keith Cockrum missed three games with injuries. Solis,
a converted running back who played mostly on special teams last
season, has become a fixture at left cornerback, with three pass
breakups and two fumble recoveries.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise, without question, has been kicker Chris
Birkholz. A walk-on from Temple, Birkholz is not mentioned in
Tech's 1998 media guide. But he is 7-of-9 on field-goal attempts
and 16-of-16 on conversions since replacing Jaret Greaser on Sept.
12 against North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   While kicking into a net on the sideline in anticipation of a
43-yard field-goal attempt, Greaser pulled a groin muscle. The
holder, Jeremy Hernandez, began screaming for Birkholz to take the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even have my shoes on,'' said Birkholz, who scrambled
to ready himself and made the 43-yarder without benefit of a
warmup.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Dykes said Birkholz ``will have to miss one'' before
Greaser gets his job back. Birkholz remains stunned by the
unexpected turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd just fill in for one game, but now I don't know
what to expect,'' Birkholz said. ``So I stay ready all the time.
We've had a lot of that this season. I think it's a real positive
when you have guys play a lot in backup roles and you can still
win. You do that, you know you're doing something right.''
</P>
<P>
   It's something Tech has been doing on a weekly basis throughout
the 1998 season.
Plugging the gaps Texas Tech is 6-0, the team's best start in 22
years, thanks largely to some key contributions from unheralded
players. The group includes: Player, Pos.Comment Matt Tittle, QB

 &HT;    Jackets can take huge step forward
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Every so often, a program reaches a defining moment _
an opportunity to take a giant step forward in the way it is
perceived on the national level.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech faces such a moment today when No. 6 Virginia comes
to Bobby Dodd Stadium. A victory over the Cavaliers would provide
the Yellow Jackets with an obvious benefit: First place in the ACC
standings, with No. 7 Florida State coming to Atlanta next week.
</P>
<P>
   The not-so-obvious benefit would come in the hype leading up to
the next game with the Seminoles, the preseason choice to win the
ACC title. Georgia Tech would get more national exposure in that
one week than in the previous few seasons combined. No decision has
been made yet, but there are strong hints that if the Yellow
Jackets beat Virginia and Florida State wins at Clemson, ESPN will
bring its College Game Day show to Georgia Tech next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   You can't buy that kind of exposure, which is the fuel that
drives such powerhouses as Florida State, Nebraska and Ohio State
and keeps them good year after year. Great players want to be at
schools that get national exposure every week, not just once in a
while. The boost to recruiting is immeasurable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tell our guys that with each win the heat gets turned
up a little bit,'' Georgia Tech coach George O'Leary said. ``Then
the question becomes, can you handle the heat in order to get what
you want?''
</P>
<P>
   Next to No. 12 Oregon at No. 2 UCLA, Virginia-Georgia Tech is
the game of the day. Will the Jackets take advantage of it? We'll
find out today at 3:30 p.m. Until then, here are this week's picks:
</P>
<P>
   No. 7 Virginia (5-0) at No. 25 Georgia Tech (4-1), 3:30 p.m.
(Channel 2): Logically, Virginia should win this game because of
its running game (1st in the ACC) and defense (2nd in the ACC).
Tech has lost one of its better backs (Charles Wiley) and young
linebackers (Matt Uremovich). But emotion, not logic, will prevail.
Georgia Tech17, Virginia 16.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt (0-5) at No. 13 Georgia (4-1), 12:30 p.m. (WXIA):
Georgia will have a serious post-Tennessee hangover. Won't matter.
Bulldogs will still roll and start thinking about Tim Couch.
Georgia 45, Vanderbilt 7.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn (1-4) at No. 5 Florida (5-1), 3:30 p.m. (CBS): The Gators
are really banged up after last week's win over LSU. Look for Steve
Spurrier to pull in the reins against Auburn's solid defense.
Florida 24, Auburn 3.
</P>
<P>
   No. 11 Oregon (5-0) at No. 2 UCLA (4-0), 3:30 p.m.: UCLA was
impressive in beating Arizona, but the Bruins haven't seen anything
like the Ducks, who are averaging 50 points. UCLA gets the edge
playing in Pasadena. UCLA 42, Oregon 35 .
</P>
<P>
   Clemson (2-4) at No. 6 Florida State (5-1), 6 p.m. , (ESPN2):
The Seminoles have to keep winning to set up a showdown with the
Georgia Tech-Virginia winner. Clemson's offense picked up last week
but not enough overcome Florida State. Florida State 28, Clemson
14.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue (3-3) at No. 12 Penn State (4-1), 3:30 p.m.: Purdue
quarterback Drew Brees set an NCAA record last week with 83
attempts. He will have to throw a bunch again to have any chance
against a stout defense. Penn State 31, Purdue 21.
</P>
<P>
   No. 22 Texas Tech (6-0) at No. 19 Colorado (5-1), 1:30 p.m.: The
Red Raiders are 6-0 for the first time since 1976. Texas Tech RB
Ricky Williams _ not the one from Texas _ has 1,026 yards. The Red
Raiders in an upset. Texas Tech 24, Colorado 20.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky (4-2) at No. 21 LSU (3-2), 9 p.m. (ESPN2): If LSU's
Kevin Faulk can't control the ball, the Tigers could be in trouble,
because they are going to find it hard to stop Tim Couch. LSU 35,
Kentucky 31.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State (2-3) at No. 4 Kansas State (5-0), 3:30 p.m.:
Kansas State has something Nebraska didn't when it played Oklahoma
St.: A quarterback (Michael Bishop) who can pass over a stacked
defense. Kansas State 28, Oklahoma State 10.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota (3-2) at No. 1 Ohio State (5-0), Noon, ESPN: Minnesota
started 3-0, but times got tough once the Gophers entered
conference play. Ohio State 45, Minnesota 14.
</P>
<P>
   The others
</P>
<P>
   ACC: Wake Forest 24, Maryland 17; N.C. State 28, Duke 17.
</P>
<P>
   SEC: Arkansas 17, South Carolina 7; Miss. State 42, ETSU 21;
Alabama 27, E. Carolina 14.
</P>
<P>
   Top 25: No. 8 Nebraska 42, Kansas 14; No. 9 Wisconsin 35,
Illinois 10; No. 10 Texas A&AMP;M 21, Baylor 10; No. 14 Virginia Tech
31, Temple 0; No. 16 Arizona 21, Oregon State 17.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's record: 13-7.
</P>
<P>
   Season's record: 83-34 (70.9 percent).

 &HT;    It's midterm exam time for Tech
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Tech flunked its first quiz of the season
Sept. 5 when it was embarrassed by Boston College 41-31.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, professor George O'Leary has put his Yellow Jackets
through a serious tutorial, with notable improvement. Tech has four
victories in a row, including two impressive performances on the
road at North Carolina and N.C. State. At 4-1 (3-0 ACC), the
Jackets have managed to crack the Top 25.
</P>
<P>
   All that is well and good, the professor said. But today his
class faces its midterm exam when No. 7 Virginia (5-0, 3-0) visits
Bobby Dodd Stadium (3:30 p.m., Channel 2)
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made some strides and gotten better, there's no question
about that,'' O'Leary said. ``Against Virginia, we'll see how
much.''
</P>
<P>
   At stake is first place in the ACC standings, with No. 6 Florida
State looming on the horizon. The Seminoles come to Atlanta next
week. Virginia goes to Tallahassee on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the George Welsh's Cavaliers have the numbers in their
favor. Virginia has the ACC's best running attack and the league's
second-best defense to Florida State. Virginia has had a week off
to get ready, something that usually favors Welsh and his
experienced staff.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, it has not been a good week on the Flats. On Monday,
Tech lost versatile running back Charles Wiley to a knee injury. On
Wednesday, the school suspended talented young linebacker Matt
Uremovich, who was caught taking an NCAA-banned,
performance-enhancing substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things I think we will overcome,'' O'Leary said. ``I've
seen this team react positively to setbacks before. I think we will
again.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary is more worried about a Virginia running game capable of
eating up the clock and keeping quarterback Joe Hamilton and the
Tech offense on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slowing down the run is the key to the game _ for both
teams,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In other games Saturday:
</P>
<P>
   _ Georgia will try to shake off the effects of last week's
disappointing loss to Tennessee when it plays Vanderbilt (0-5) for
Homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   _ First place in the Southern Conference and the No. 1 spot in
the Division I-AA rankings will be on the line when No. 3
Appalachian State (5-0) travels to No. 2 Georgia Southern (6-0).
Previous No. 1 McNeese State lost Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 2 UCLA (4-0) faces a major test at home today against No.
11 Oregon (5-0).
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 5 Florida (5-1) tries to keep its SEC and national
championship hopes alive when it hosts struggling Auburn (1-4).

 &HT;    Smith's request to forego fine denied
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Falcons and starting right defensive end
Chuck Smith got some disappointing news Friday, learning the NFL
denied his appeal of a $7,500 fine against Smith for a low hit on
former Carolina QB Kerry Collins in the season opener Sept. 6. All
parties had been under the incorrect impression the matter was
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a letter from NFL director of game operations Peter
Hadhazy said that because of Smith's track record for this kind of
thing, the next offense of this nature could lead to a suspension.
Smith was fined $25,000 for a more severe hit on Collins in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, his agent, Jimmy Sexton, and Falcons officials had been
led to believe the matter was going to be dropped after
conversations with league finemeister Gene Washington and other
officials in the NFL office.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has a rule that says if a player has an unobstructed
path to a QB, he cannot hit him at or below the knees. Smith and
the Falcons contended that Smith was tripped by Carolina tackle
Blake Brockermeyer, and upon hitting the ground, reached for
Collins who was running toward him.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out those conversations were informal, however. Reeves,
who was not involved in an official capacity in the appeal process,
said he plans to call NFL commissioner Paul Talgiabue, seeking
relief in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket talk
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons (4-1) have distributed about 56,000 tickets for
Sunday's game in the Georgia Dome against the Saints (3-2), and
with strong sales today at ticket outlets and a good walk-up sale
before the game, sales could surpass 60,000 for the first time in
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Roster news
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' four early inactive players are LB Henri Crockett
(dislocated wrist), OL Dave Widell, RB Harold Green, and S Omar
Brown. ... Reserve CB Randy Fuller's strained hamstring is still a
problem, and a game-day decision will be made on his availability.
Meanwhile, CB Darren Anderson, who was signed more two weeks ago
when the team waived CB Juran Bolden, has progressed to a point
where he grasps much of the Falcons' nickel and dime defenses.
Also, reserve CB Michael Booker, who missed the last two games with
a strained thigh muscle, will play.
</P>
<P>
   Colossal Cam
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are wary of big Saints TE Cam Cleeland, who at 6-4,
272 pounds is critical in the running game. The second-round pick
from Washington also is the Saints' leading receiver, with 18
catches for 241 yards (13.4-yard average), and two TDs.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   Falcons safety Devin Bush's appeal of the $5,000 fine he got for
a late hit in the 51-23 win over Carolina Oct. 4 could be heard as
early as next week. Bush probably doesn't have much of a chance,
since he was penalized and ejected. ... New Orleans WR Andre
Hastings, a graduate of Morrow High and the University of Georgia,
this week declined multiple interview requests with Georgia media.
... The Falcons elected backup DE John Burrough as alternate
representative to the NFL Players Association. DE Lester Archambeau
is the primary rep. ... Dan Stryzinski has had 10 punts originate
from the opponents' 44-yard line and in. He's averaging 32.7 yards
on those kicks, with an average hang time of 4.58 seconds. On his
20 kicks from the 45 and back, he's averaging 40.2 yards with an
average hang time of 4.4 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Red hot in red zone
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons continue to perform well in the red zone. Defining
red-zone possessions as any that include at least one first down
inside the 20, Atlanta has scored 100 percent of the time, with
seven TDs and six field goals. That's tied with six other teams.
Since joining the Falcons last season, QB Chris Chandler has thrown
15 TDs in the red zone, and no interceptions.

 &HT;    Saints series `like high school rivalry'
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No current Atlanta Falcons player or coach has been
through more Saints-Falcons games than middle linebacker Jessie
Tuggle, who has seen this rivalry up close and personal 22 times _
with 10 wins _ since joining the team as an undrafted free agent in
1987.
</P>
<P>
   It started ugly, as the Saints won the first five times, seven
of the first eight, and 10 of the first 13. But Atlanta has won six
in a row, sweeping the seasons series three years consecutively.
</P>
<P>
   Tuggle, a four-time Pro Bowl player from Griffin High School,
has had some great games against the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   He had a season-high 20 tackles in a 27-24 overtime win at New
Orleans in 1995, icing the victory with an end-zone interception
with 1:11 left. In 1993, he recorded his 1,000th career tackle
against the Saints. In 1992, he scored on a 69-yard fumble recovery
in a 10-7 loss at New Orleans. And in 1991, he had a 22-tackle game
against the Saints, second-best in his career.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal-Constitution spoke with Tuggle about the
Saints-Falcons rivalry, which is the top one for each team.
Thirteen of the games have been decided by a TD or less.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What moment among all others in these games will you never
forget?
</P>
<P>
   A: I guess the best memory would be when we beat them (27-20) in
the playoffs (in 1991). That place was sold out, and it was so loud
you couldn't hear yourself talk.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How about the crummiest?
</P>
<P>
   A: Any time you lose down there, you get in the middle of all
that ``Who dat'' stuff (from fans). The worst feeling is if I've
just played as hard as I can, and walking off the field those fans
are still bugging me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What makes this a great rivalry?
</P>
<P>
   A: We're pretty close, and I remember when we would always take
10,000 fans when we went down there, and they would bring 20,000
when they came here. It seems like it didn't matter what the
records were ... it always seemed to go down to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Falcons kicker Morten Andersen has 25 game-winning kicks in
his career, and in his 13 years with the Saints, six came against
Atlanta. Any stick especially hard in your craw?
</P>
<P>
   A: Aw, man, it seems like there were a million. All I know is I
remember when Morten became a free agent (after the 1994 season),
we picked him up, and I was like, ``They got to be kidding, letting
him go.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is this game any better than the old days, when the Griffin
Bears took on the Newnan Cougars?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's like a high school rivalry. It brings back those Friday
night memories of when you would play in high school and everybody
would get real emotional. In the NFL, you don't get that too much.
That's the feeling I get when I play the New Orleans Saints. You
get butterflies, you want to play well, and you want to win.

 &HT;    Michael Waltrip, Mattei team up
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _
</P>
<P>
   WINSTON CUP
</P>
<P>
   Michael Waltrip has driven for Dick Bahre, Chuck Rider and the
Woods brothers, all without a single visit to a Winston Cup victory
lane in 391 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, he'll try again, with Jim Mattei Motorsports, which
has released Geoff Bodine following this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael has a lot of experience and a great passion for this
sport,'' Mattei said. ``I consider him to be at the beginning of
his career. I believe the kind of equipment we'll have with our
race team, he'll be stepping up to a new level in Winston Cup
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip has agreed to a two-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Mattei obviously is very committed to being successful,''
he said, ``and that type of commitment is what I need.''
</P>
<P>
   GREEN'S SHOT: David Green has been offered the No. 41 Larry
Hedrick Motorsports ride for 1999, but Green has yet to make a
decision. He stepped into the car at Martinsville but didn't
qualify; made the field at Charlotte, but was caught up in the big
wreck and finished last; and didn't qualify last week at Talladega.
``My plans are still up in the air,'' said Green, who was released
earlier this year by Buz McCall's team and returned to the Busch
series.
</P>
<P>
   BRIEFLY: For the first time in Mike Skinner's career, he led the
most laps, 74 in Sunday's Winston 500. Skinner also was the halfway
leader to earn the $10,000 bonus. ... Going into the Pepsi 400,
Bobby Labonte has the best average finish on restrictor-plate
tracks in 1998. His average is 3.0, compared with such notables as
Terry Labonte, 6.67; Jeff Gordon, 7.67; Dale Jarrett, 12.6; Rusty
Wallace, 14.65; Dale Earnhardt, 23.00; and Mark Martin, 33.67.
</P>
<P>
   BUSCH
</P>
<P>
   Testing at AMS
</P>
<P>
   Buckshot Jones put in a little track time recently at Atlanta
Motor Speedway to test his Busch car in preparation for this week's
Gateway 250. He is ninth in points but only seven points from
sixth. ``Atlanta is a smooth track, with more grip than Charlotte
or Texas,'' Jones said. ``I don't have a lot of experience here,
but I'm comfortable with the speed, and I really like the way the
car feels on the track.''
</P>
<P>
   KENSETH'S REVENGE: A year ago, the Gateway Raceway got the best
of Matt Kenseth. ``When we got out of the one lane you could run
on, all the loose asphalt knocked all the engine belts off and
ended our day early.''
</P>
<P>
   BRIEFLY: Dale Earnhardt Jr. carries a 97-point lead over Kenseth
to Gateway. Statistically, Earnhardt is dominating most categories:
Six victories, 1,390 laps led, 15 races led, 1,325.35 miles and
three poles.
</P>
<P>
   CRAFTSMAN TRUCKS
</P>
<P>
   Trucking is tough
</P>
<P>
   Boris Said won his first Craftsman Truck race last week at Sears
Point, winning by 6.549 seconds, the largest margin of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Said led 47 of the 77 laps in the race and proclaimed afterward,
``It wasn't easy winning one of these races.''
</P>
<P>
   That from a racer who has won Le Mans and the 24 Hours of
Daytona.BRIEFLY: Said's victory in the Kragen/Exide 150 made him
the season's sixth first-time winner, one fewer than last year's
record number. His average speed of 72.939 mph was a course record,
eclipsing Joe Ruttman's 70.199 mph. ... With three races remaining,
Jack Sprague's 18-point lead over Ron Hornaday is the smallest in
the tour's history.

 &HT;    Jarrett anxious to step up to `plate'
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Dale Jarrett goes for a restrictor-plate
double tonight, hoping to back up last week's Winston 500 victory
with another of its kind, the Pepsi 400 at Daytona International
Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   While most teams would rather do a double-header at Charlotte
than one restrictor plate outing, Jarrett says bring 'em on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it,'' said Jarrett, who
has won three restrictor-plate races, two Daytona 500s and last
week's Winston 500. ``This is the car with a good chassis that we
had, and put a new body on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd Parrott (crew chief) spent countless hours in the wind
tunnel, and we kind of went back to a different setup at these type
tracks and the car drove just great. That's what I'm gonna need
Saturday night, so I'm looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett isn't alone. Jeff Gordon is no stranger to
restrictor-plate races. He's won three, two at Daytona. He has a
288-point lead over Mark Martin and can win the championship by
finishing 16th or better in the last four races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're in real good shape for Daytona,'' said Gordon,
who starts sixth. ``We've been very fortunate to contend for the
championship the past few years, and I think every year we contend,
we get a little more experience and I think we get smarter and more
confident about what it's going to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we were really awesome all year long until the end
of the season, and then we struggled. This year, we came in and
said we're not going to let that happen, and we've done a pretty
good job of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wish we didn't have another restrictor-plate race
this week,'' Martin said prior to Thursday's qualifying, where he
was sixth fastest. ``We ran real good, especially with an untested
car. We're pleased with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We qualified good at Talladega, then didn't race very well.
So, we hope we'll race as well as we qualified.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, there are the lights, which got good reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like the track surface was consistent throughout
qualifying,'' said pole winner Bobby Labonte. ``The corners are lit
up real well. It's bright enough where it's not like you have
headlights on and you're going down the road at night. There is a
uniqueness to the track as compared to the sun. I really didn't see
a whole lot of difference.

TEXAS TECH FINDS HIDDEN TREASURES IN RESERVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before every home game, members of the Texas Tech football team
follow the Masked Rider onto the playing surface at Jones Stadium.
Dressed in black and cloaked in anonymity, the mounted horseman
also makes celebratory sprints after Tech touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   A school tradition since 1953, the mascot serves as a perfect
symbol for a football team off to its best start in 22 years. Every
week, it seems, a different Red Raiders player steps forward after
an injury to one of the starters.
</P>
<P>
   Cloaked in anonymity, the reserve makes a game-turning play that
lifts the team to victory and causes fans to wonder, ``Who was that
masked man?'' The formula has worked well enough to carry No. 22
Tech (6-0, 3-0) to the top of the Big 12 South Division standings
heading into its 12:30 p.m. battle today against No. 19 Colorado
(5-1, 2-1) in Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, coach Spike Dykes would prefer to stop relying
so heavily on the contributions of his reserves. But he can't
imagine where the Red Raiders would be without them. A 6-0 record,
he suggested, would not have been imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, I'm surprised where we are ... based on all the
different faces we've had in there. Some of those guys have played
above their heads,'' said Dykes, who has seen 11 starters or top
reserves miss a combined 22 games because of injury. ``It's been
one of the most gallant efforts I've seen out of a lot of guys who
haven't played all that much. If they were great players, they'd be
starting. But they're not. They're overachievers, and they've
really lifted this team.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent example came in last week's 24-17 victory
against Oklahoma State. Dorian Pitts, making his first start at
strong-side linebacker in place of injured Ty Ardoin, blocked a
punt to set up a second-quarter touchdown that gave Tech a 14-10
lead. In the fourth quarter, he returned a fumble 53 yards for the
game-winning score.
</P>
<P>
   Dykes credited Pitts with making ``the biggest plays in the
game.'' Oklahoma State coach Bob Simmons credited him with
something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blocked punt changed the momentum of the game,'' Simmons
said. ``We didn't have a breakdown. The Tech player just took more
pride in getting there than our guy did in stopping him.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons' praise landed on the shoulders of Pitts. But his words
could summarize the secret of Tech's success, said offensive guard
Lance Williams, a redshirt freshman from Arlington Bowie High
School.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some depth and everybody can play. We take a lot of
pride in that,'' said Williams, who made his first career start
last week in place of injured Curtis Lowery and is expected to play
against Colorado. ``It makes practices more intense. This week,
Curtis is still hurt, so the rest of us have to step it up. It's
been like that all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Significant contributions have come from unlikely sources. When
quarterback Rob Peters suffered shoulder and thumb injuries in the
season opener, fifth-year senior Matt Tittle rallied the team to a
35-3 victory against UT-El Paso and posted a 4-0 record as a
starter until Peters reclaimed the job. Heading into the season,
Tittle had completed one pass for 7 yards in his college career.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and Justin Collingsworth were among four reserve
offensive linemen who played the brunt of the Baylor game when
injuries felled all starters but left tackle Jonathan Gray. Tech
produced a season-high 538 yards in a 31-29 victory.
</P>
<P>
   With weakside linebacker Kevin McCullar sidelined the past three
weeks by an ankle injury, replacement Tim Duffie has emerged as one
of the team leaders in tackles. Duffie, a junior, has 37 tackles,
one sack, one forced fumble and one fumble recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries have not been the only conduit into the lineup for
newcomers. Freshman Kevin Curtis, the only member of Tech's 1998
signing class who is not being redshirted, has played well enough
in spot duty at free safety (15 tackles, one pass breakup) to allow
starter John Norman to take breathers before and after kick
returns. Norman ranks among the national leaders in kickoff returns
(35.8 yard average) and punt returns (12.6 average).
</P>
<P>
   Joining Norman as starters in the secondary are two former
walk-ons, Reagan Bownds and Oscar Solis. Bownds, who has 44 tackles
and two interceptions, won a starting berth with his solid play at
rover while Keith Cockrum missed three games with injuries. Solis,
a converted running back who played mostly on special teams last
season, has become a fixture at left cornerback, with three pass
breakups and two fumble recoveries.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise, without question, has been kicker Chris
Birkholz. A walk-on from Temple, Birkholz is not mentioned in
Tech's 1998 media guide. But he is 7-of-9 on field-goal attempts
and 16-of-16 on conversions since replacing Jaret Greaser on Sept.
12 against North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   While kicking into a net on the sideline in anticipation of a
43-yard field-goal attempt, Greaser pulled a groin muscle. The
holder, Jeremy Hernandez, began screaming for Birkholz to take the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even have my shoes on,'' said Birkholz, who scrambled
to ready himself and made the 43-yarder without benefit of a
warmup.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Dykes said Birkholz ``will have to miss one'' before
Greaser gets his job back. Birkholz remains stunned by the
unexpected turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd just fill in for one game, but now I don't know
what to expect,'' Birkholz said. ``So I stay ready all the time.
We've had a lot of that this season. I think it's a real positive
when you have guys play a lot in backup roles and you can still
win. You do that, you know you're doing something right.''
</P>
<P>
   It's something Tech has been doing on a weekly basis throughout
the 1998 season.
Plugging the gaps Texas Tech is 6-0, the team's best start in 22
years, thanks largely to some key contributions from unheralded
players. The group includes: Player, Pos.Comment Matt Tittle, QB
4-0 as starter while Rob Peters nursed injuries. Dorian Pitts, LB

 &HT;    Padres pitching lineup set
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Beyond tonight's matchup between David Wells and
Kevin Brown, the Yankees and Padres put the rest of their pitching
plans in place Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will follow Wells with rookie Orlando Hernandez and
then David Cone and Andy Pettitte. The Padres will go with Andy
Ashby in Game 2 followed by Sterling Hitchcock. In Game 4, the
Padres might turn to righthander Joey Hamilton, but only if they
are not trailing in the series. Otherwise, they will go with Brown
on three days of rest.
</P>
<P>
   The use of Hernandez in Game 2 is a change of thinking for the
Yankees, who against Cleveland pitched Cone after Wells. But it was
``El Duque'' who proved to be the turning point in that series,
winning Game 4 when the Yankees were down 2-1 and earning the
chance for two starts in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   In last year's Series, it was Hernandez's brother Livan who beat
the Braves in Game 5 of the league championship and then won two
games in the Series en route to a Florida world championship.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry leaves hospital
</P>
<P>
   Yankees outfielder Darryl Strawberry, who underwent colon cancer
surgery two weeks ago, left the hospital Friday. ``It's been a
difficult time but now that time is over,'' Strawberry said. ``As
you can see, I've lost a lot of weight. But from my nurses to my
doctors, they told me everything will come back.'' Strawberry
returned to his home in New Jersey and will watch tonight's game on
television.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa pinch-hits for DiMaggio
</P>
<P>
   Yankees great Joe DiMaggio, 83, is being treated for pneumonia
in Hollywood, Fla., and will not attend this weekend's games.
DiMaggio was scheduled to throw out the ceremonial first pitch
tonight. Instead, Sammy Sosa will do the honors. ``He's had
pneumonia three months,'' longtime friend Morris Engelberg said.
``He walked around with it for a couple of months. He couldn't
knock it out. He should be out this coming Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Ticket costs soaring
</P>
<P>
   Scalpers are asking a boatload of money for tickets to games
tonight and Sunday. One ticket agency was asking $2,500 for field
box seats that were $150 at the box office, $550 ($100) for
upper-level box seats and $315 ($40) for bleacher seats. Those
prices will likely go up at least another 25 percent before the
first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   No stadium vote
</P>
<P>
   A referendum on whether a $1 billion stadium should be built for
the Yankess in Manhattan was pulled off the ballot for next month's
election by an appeals court. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is pushing for
the new stadium but would like to do it without putting the issue
to a vote. Others say the general public is opposed to moving the
team from the Bronx to Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Around the horn
</P>
<P>
   Yankees center fielder Bernie Williams is one player who likes
to keep to himself. ``Once you're here in New York, you have your
life kind of dug into a little bit,'' Williams said. ``I've always
taken a lot of pride in keeping my private life private. I don't
see why it shouldn't stay that way.'' ... Pettitte missed Friday's
workout and might not be in uniform for Games 1 and 2. Pettitte,
scheduled to start Game 4, remains with his father, who had heart
bypass surgery. ... San Diego's Jim Leyritz, who played on New
York's1996 World Championship team, is getting a hard time about
his shaved head from his former teammates. ``My wife almost fell
off the table when she saw that,'' right fielder Paul O'Neill said.
``That, we need to talk about.'' ... Brown has a career 12-2 mark
against the Yankees. The next best active mark against New York is
Wells, who was 13-5 against the Yankees when he was with other
teams.

 &HT;    World Series matchup
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   ROTATION
</P>
<P>
   At the top, both teams have wonderful starting pitching. David
Wells and rookie Orlando Hernandez carried the Yankees last round,
while Kevin Brown, Andy Ashby and Sterling Hitchcock did the same
for San Diego. New York's problems are that David Cone has
struggled and Andy Pettitte got crushed in his one start against
the Indians. Unless they are down 3-0 in the series, the Padres
probably will go with Joey Hamilton, whose inconsistency can drive
a manager crazy. The key here might be Hitchcock. He was fabulous
against the Braves, but the question is whether he can do it
against his former club. Advantage: Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   BULLPEN
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's Trevor Hoffman and Mariano Rivera of the Yankees are
the best closers in the game. But the Padres might have a problem
behind Hoffman, as shown against the Braves. However, San Diego
might have found an answer in Wednesday's clinching game, with long
men Mark Langston and Brian Boehringer in setup roles. The Yankees'
bullpen is strong from top to bottom. Jeff Nelson dominates
right-handed hitting, and left-hander Mike Stanton always has been
a dominant pitcher in the postseason. Advantage: Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   CATCHER
</P>
<P>
   No stars here, just workhorses, as the Yankees use both Joe
Girardi and Jorge Posada, and the Padres go with Carlos Hernandez
and Jim Leyritz. Of the four, Leyritz can be the most damaging at
the plate. None is great defensively, and the Yankees, which led
the majors in stolen bases, are certain to go to their running
game. Advantage: Padres.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST BASE
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, one would think the Yankees have a big edge,
with Tino Martinez over Wally Joyner. Not true. Martinez has hit
just .167 in the postseason. Joyner isn't going to carry any team
on his shoulders, but he's consistent and solid defensively. Still,
Martinez can dominate if he gets hot. Advantage: Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   SECOND BASE
</P>
<P>
   Both players lead off for their teams. The Indians series was a
strange one for Chuck Knoblauch, who already has a love-hate
relationship with the New York fans. Knoblauch is hitting only .167
but does appear to have overcome his Game 2 snafu against the
Indians. Quilvio Veras is not much of an offensive threat, but he
rarely strikes out or makes mistakes in the field. Advantage:
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   SHORTSTOP
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter for the Yankees; Chris Gomez for the Padres. OK,
it's a mismatch on paper, although both were under .200 at the
plate in the last round. Jeter has turned into one of the best
all-around players in the game and is a super No. 2 hitter. Gomez
can be shaky with his glove. Advantage: Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   THIRD BASE
</P>
<P>
   Pick a Yankee MVP from the start of the season, and it just
might be Scott Brosius. Pick a postseason MVP position player MVP
for the Padres, and it's probably Ken Caminiti, who got the two
biggest hits in the series against the Braves, an extra-inning
homer in Game 1 and the single to start the rally to win Game 6.
Brosius makes it awfully tough for opposing pitchers to overlook
the bottom part of the Yankees lineup, while Caminiti will be
helped by the fact that Greg Vaughn should be in the lineup for the
entire series. Advantage: Padres.
</P>
<P>
   LEFT FIELD
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn appears recovered from his quadriceps injury and will be
back for San Diego. Vaughn's presence in the No. 3 spot in the
order should make a San Diego lineup much more dangerous than it
was against the Braves. For the Yankees, this spot was a problem
against the Indians, with four different players _ Shane Spencer,
Chad Curtis, Tim Raines and Ricky Ledee _ starting games. Look for
Curtis to play the most because he is the best defensive player.
Advantage: Padres.
</P>
<P>
   CENTER FIELD
</P>
<P>
   New York's Bernie Williams is a fabulous player although he
hasn't looked it much this month. Still, his World Series in 1996
was one to remember, and very little drops in against him in the
field. The Padres' Steve Finley struggled in the regular season but
was effective against the Braves. Vaughn's return will enable
Finley to bat lower in the lineup. Advantage: Yankees
</P>
<P>
   RIGHT FIELD
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's Tony Gwynn might still be the best pure hitter in
baseball, but he hasn't showed it in the postseason, hitting just
.220. Gwynn also seems to be bothered still by a foot injury. New
York's Paul O'Neill played a major role against the Indians and is
hitting .306 in the postseason. He is one of the toughest outs in
the game, and his intensity keeps the rest of the team on its feet.
Advantage: Yankees
</P>
<P>
   DESIGNATED HITTER
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will go with Chili Davis, while the Padres platoon
the right-handed hitting Leyrtiz and left-handed hitting John
Vander Wal. Leyritz is being called the new Mr. October and would
love nothing more than to beat his old team. Davis, meanwhile,
showed against the Indians that he still has some pop in his bat.
Here, the platoon works better. Advantage: Padres.
</P>
<P>
   BENCH
</P>
<P>
   In the four possible games in New York, it won't be used much,
but on NL turf, no one is a better pinch-hitter than Vander Wal.
Also, the Padres have former Yankee prospect Ruben Rivera, who
filled in admirably for Vaughn against Atlanta. The Yankees also
have a lot to choose from, including deep-threat Spencer.
Advantage: Padres
</P>
<P>
   MANAGER
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's Bruce Bochy did a masterful job against the Braves.
Almost every move was a good one, and even using Brown in Game 5
worked out because Bochy now has him available to pitch three times
in this series. On the other bench is Joe Torre, who has been here
before. Torre has improved over the years at working his bench and
bullpen. Advantage: Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   OVERALL
</P>
<P>
   On paper, New York should win. At their best, no one can stop
the Yankees. But the poor-pitching Indians proved that New York can
be beaten, and the Padres will throw a lot better arms against them
than Cleveland did. Also, when many people thought the Padres were
through after a Game 5 loss to the Braves, they came right out and
did the job. This series might come down to who is better between
Wells and Brown. A hunch here says the Padres are a team of
destiny. San Diego in seven.

NATO EXTENDS DEADLINE FOR WITHDRAWAL OF TROOPS FROM KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-ALBANIANS) 
(js) 
 BY STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO granted President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia a reprieve on Friday, extending by 10 days its deadline
for him to withdraw military and police forces cracking down on
ethnic Albanians in the province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of abundant evidence that Milosevic has not yet kept
his pledges to withdraw the forces, NATO's representatives in
Brussels gave him until Oct. 27 to comply or face the threat of
NATO military attacks. They said the reprieve bought time for
international observers to arrive in Kosovo and for unarmed NATO
reconnaissance planes to begin flying overhead.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, which voted on Tuesday to authorize limited cruise missile
strikes against targets throughout Yugoslavia, had previously given
Milosevic until 8 p.m. Friday to comply.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Clinton administration officials maintained that the
extension of the deadline did not reflect a weakening of the
alliance's resolve to use force if Milosevic breaks the agreement
brokered earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the reconnaissance flights _ an unprecedented
incursion by NATO into Yugoslav airspace _ is set to begin with a
U.S. U-2 spy plane on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats who have returned to Kosovo said Friday that there was
no decrease in the police or military units and that there were
some skirmishes between the Serb units and the Kosovar rebels.
</P>
<P>
   And the diplomats said there were some instances when they were
denied access to monitor any withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   Although they hope the scrutiny will be a deterrence to renewed
fighting, the growing presence of the observers and humanitarian
workers on the ground could gravely complicate the ability to carry
out any strikes, if Milosevic continues to resist meeting all the
demands.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said Friday evening that the
NATO allies, which approached the decision to use force with great
apprehension only after nine months of fighting and massacres, had
agreed that Milosevic needed more time to carry out the withdrawal
of his forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can quarrel a day or two one way or the other, but the
basic feeling was to give him a period of time in which he has no
excuse not to comply fully and then have it be automatic that the
authority to use force would be back,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, NATO's commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, presented
Yugoslav officials with a three-page list detailing, for the first
time, the number of military and police units that must pull out of
Kosovo to satisfy NATO. The list identified _ by unit name and
number _ 4,000 to 5,000 Yugoslav army troops and 3,000 to 4,000
interior police units that had poured into the province after the
crackdown began.
</P>
<P>
   Those troops were only a fraction of those involved in the
fighting, which, though ostensibly aimed at insurgents, killed
hundreds of civilians and drove tens of thousands from their homes.
Even if Milosevic withdraws the units on the list, the Yugoslav
army would have more than 12,000 troops in Kosovo, while the
interior police would have 6,000, according to U.S. intelligence
reports.
</P>
<P>
   While the U.N. resolution calling on Milosevic to end his
crackdown did not specify the exact number of troops to be
withdrawn, the current level of Serb troops whom NATO will allow to
remain in Kosovo falls far short of the Clinton administration's
public statements calling for a significant draw down of police and
military forces. It also appeared Friday that there would be far
fewer international observers than first announced.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. envoy who brokered the deal, had
challenged Milosevic to accept 2,000 monitors from the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which represents 54
countries in Europe, as well as the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But Holbrooke concocted the number before anyone asked the OSCE,
officials said. The organization, based in Vienna, is expected to
request fewer monitors, with one estimate suggesting there would be
no more than 800 observers.
</P>
<P>
   Ivo Daalder, a former adviser on the Balkans for the National
Security Council who is now a scholar at the Brookings Institute in
Washington, said the agreement with Milosevic left much unresolved,
while the decision to extend the deadline eased pressure on him to
comply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Milosevic hasn't complied _ and the deadline was
extended _ shows the deadline isn't serious, that the deadline is
no longer meaningful,'' Daalder said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has readied more than 400 warplanes, including 260 U.S.
jets. NATO and Pentagon officials said those aircraft would remain
on alert through the new deadline _ ready to strike, they insisted,
if needed. The aircraft carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower, along with
several warships and submarines capable of firing cruise missiles,
have also remained in the Adriatic Sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not NATO blinking,'' the State Department's spokesman,
James Rubin, said.
</P>
<P>
   However, it will not be possible for the alliance to keep those
planes poised indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO and administration officials pointed to signs that
Milosevic was complying. Some intelligence reports suggested that a
few Yugoslav army units had left the field, and journalists in the
provincial capital, Pristina, reported seeing a convoy of Yugoslav
armored vehicles, including tanks, leave the city.
</P>
<P>
   However, there was little indication that Milosevic had begun
any significant withdrawals, and clear evidence that some forces
had dug in for the winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lower visible presence of police and military,''
the senior administration official said. ``There are fewer
roadblocks. There is more movement. The place where the compliance
is least good is in the actual withdrawal.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Pentagon said the reconnaissance flights, which
were still being organized Friday, would give NATO officials an
absolute picture. The administration has trumpeted the flights as
one of the most significant concessions by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   However, the agreement says NATO will give the Yugoslav forces a
weekly schedule of flights, according to a copy of the agreement
obtained by The New York Times. The agreement also calls for NATO
and Yugoslav air force officials to operate together at liaison
offices in the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, and the NATO air base at
Vicenza, Italy.

2 VEHICLES USED IN TANZANIA BOMBING, FBI SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania _ In a rare public statement about the
August bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa, the FBI said
Friday that two vehicles had been used in the attack on the embassy
here.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI also indicated that it had learned the identities of new
suspects in the blast here, and that they are at large. They were
in a Suzuki Samurai, one of the two vehicles identified Friday,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Two vehicles were also used in the bombing of the embassy in
Nairobi, according to indictments that have been handed down. One
carried the bomb, the other guided the first vehicle through the
streets of Nairobi to the embassy. Investigators are pursuing the
theory that the modus operandi was the same here.
</P>
<P>
   One of the vehicles used in the blast here was an Atlas
refrigeration truck made by Nissan, with a silver-colored cargo box
and white or beige cab, the FBI and the Tanzania Criminal
Investigation Division said at a news conference Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   This was the vehicle that investigators now believe carried the
bomb, which killed 11 people and wounded at least 86. The driver of
the vehicle, who has not been identified, died in the attack,
according to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The simultaneous blast in Nairobi killed more than 250,
including 12 Americans. Three people have been indicted in New York
in connection with the attacks, which the Clinton administration
has charged were masterminded by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile
who lives in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's development should put to rest earlier reports that a
water tanker, which regularly delivered water to the embassy here,
had carried the bomb, an investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   The refrigeration truck followed the water tanker into the
compound, according to a U.S. security official.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known how the refrigeration truck, a 1987 Nissan,
penetrated the embassy compound here without being adequately
searched. At Friday's news conference, FBI Agent Ken Maxwell read a
brief statement and declined to take any questions. The head of
Tanzania's Criminal Investigation Division, Adadi Rajabu, read a
similar statement in Swahili, and also declined to take questions.
</P>
<P>
   The second vehicle was a Suzuki Samurai, a small jeep popular in
East Africa. It had been ``utilized by suspects thus far
identified,'' Maxwell said. He did not say how it had been used or
who the suspects were.
</P>
<P>
   Tanzania has charged two men in connection with the bombing,
Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed and Rashid Saleh Hemed.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons that are not clear, the Clinton administration has
not sought to extradite either of these men, even though it has
brought other suspects back to the United States, where they have
been indicted. A diplomat here said the United States did not
consider the evidence against Ahmed to be very strong.
</P>
<P>
   Since the bombings, the FBI and their counterparts here and in
Kenya have made few public statements.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's news conference was for the purpose of issuing an
appeal to the Tanzanian public to come forth with any information
about the vehicles, an indication that while the investigators feel
they have made ``a significant amount of progress,'' as Maxwell
said Friday, they are also stymied.

   CUT IN U.S. INTEREST RATES HELPS MARKETS RALLY ABROAD
</P>
<P>
   Stock markets in Asia and Europe surged in response to
Thursday's interest rate reduction by the Federal Reserve. Hong
Kong's Hang Seng index jumped 9 percent, to 9,777.01, its highest
level since early May. Shares in Singapore, Bangkok, Jakarta and
Manila all rose more than 5 percent. The Nikkei index of 225 issues
in Tokyo gained 2.19 percent. The German DAX index climbed 1.76
percent, and the main market gauge in London increased 1.38
percent.
</P>
<P>
   REASONS FOR AN INTEREST RATE CUT
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan and the other members of the Federal Reserve were
criticized for not cutting interest rates aggressively to offset
the 1989-1990 credit crunch. Analysts say the chairman of the
central bank does not want to be caught in that situation again,
which is one reason why he pushed to lower interest rates Thursday.
More interest rate reductions are now expected later this year and
possibly into next.
</P>
<P>
   MILD GAIN IN SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS
</P>
<P>
   The government said Social Security benefits will rise 1.3
percent next year, the smallest cost-of-living increase since 1987,
because of exceptionally low inflation. More than 44 million
Americans, most of them elderly, receive Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   BUDGET AGREEMENT STILL NEEDS WORK
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans sounded notes of discord over the $1.7 trillion
Federal budget deal, but they also said they would probably vote
for the package because it increased defense spending and provided
aid to farmers. However, no one can vote on the package just yet
because there are still disputes to iron out.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked into the $1.7 trillion federal budget agreement is a
measure that would restrict children's access to pornography on the
Internet. The measure says Internet merchants and others will be in
violation only if they give children access to material that is
``harmful to minors.''
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION DECLINED LAST MONTH
</P>
<P>
   Output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities fell
three-tenths of 1 percent in September and consumer prices were
unchanged last month for the first time in six months, further
signs that the economy is slowing. A third economic indicator, the
University of Michigan's index of consumer confidence, fell to 98.9
this month, from 100.9 in September.
</P>
<P>
   SHAKE-UP CONTINUES AT MERRILL LYNCH
</P>
<P>
   A shake-up in the executive suite continued at Merrill Lynch.
The leading brokerage firm, led by David H. Komansky, left, named
G. Kelly Martin, 39, as chief of the debt business, replacing Seth
Waugh, who will become Martin's deputy. Waugh had been co-head of
the global debt unit since 1997. The change is the second in two
days. On Thursday, Merrill named Richard A. Dunn to replace Daniel
Napoli as head of its risk management team. Both Mr. Waugh and
Napoli were demoted, but the firm said it was not assigning blame
to them and that both will stay on the job.
</P>
<P>
   HOECHST CALLS OFF SALE OF HERBERTS
</P>
<P>
   The German chemical maker Hoechst has ended talks to sell its
Herberts paint unit to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. The buyout firm was
offering a price below what Hoechst was willing to accept.
</P>
<P>
   NISSAN MOTOR EXPECTS A NET LOSS
</P>
<P>
   Nissan Motor, Japan's second-largest automaker, said that it
expected to post a net loss of 33 billion yen ($284 million) for
the first half of the current business year because of huge losses
on its securities holdings.
</P>
<P>
   PROFITS DECLINED AT CATERPILLAR
</P>
<P>
   Caterpillar, the manufacturer of construction and earth-moving
equipment, reported that third-quarter profits fell 12.7 percent,
to $336 million, or 92 cents a diluted share. Sales jumped 12.5
percent, to $5.17 billion.

NECESSITY BRIDGES GULF BETWEEN GORE AND GEPHARDT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.H., Iowa, Mo., Tenn.)  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The possibility that impeachment proceedings
against President Clinton could weaken the Democrats this year, and
again in the presidential election in 2000, has helped bring
together the two leading potential candidates for that race, Vice
President Al Gore and the House minority leader, Rep. Dick
Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   During private meals and joint public appearances in recent
months, the two have struck a partnership, perhaps one of political
necessity.
</P>
<P>
   The warmer Gore-Gephardt relationship is striking for several
reasons, not the least of which is the acrimony arising from the
presidential campaign of 1988, when both men lost the nomination to
Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore-Gephardt relationship was nasty in those days,
punctuated by coarse rhetoric from them and their staffs. In one
1988 debate, Gephardt snapped at Gore, ``Lately, you have been
sounding more like Al Haig than Al Gore.'' Gore responded: ``That
line sounds more like Richard Nixon than Richard Gephardt.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early years of the Clinton administration, Gephardt aides
said they believed Gore blocked Democrats with strong ties to
Gephardt from working at the highest levels of government. And in
1996, most House Democrats thought the Clinton-Gore ticket was
concerned only with its re-election, not with congressional
candidates. Gephardt never said as much openly, but his allies in
the House did.
</P>
<P>
   That helped fuel the longstanding animosity between the Gore and
Gephardt staffs, which became an open secret throughout official
Washington, and which remains, though to a lesser degree. Policy
differences have also remained, even through the Clinton
presidency, on issues like trade policy and welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Yet aides to both men now acknowledge a thaw, borne in large
measure of the party's need to project unity and thus hold down
potential losses in congressional and state elections in a year the
president has been wounded by the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Terry McAuliffe, who was Clinton's chief fund-raiser in 1996 and
who maintains close ties to both Gore and Gephardt, said the
relationship between the two men has improved dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have tremendous respect for each other,'' McAuliffe said.
``They are at the point now that they enjoy working together to
solve issues and to work on projects.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in a thought likely to appeal more to the vice president
than to the minority leader, McAuliffe suggested that a
Gore-Gephardt ticket in 2000 would be ``the strongest Democratic
ticket out there.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, such formulations remain premature, especially with
Gephardt indicating that he would be Gore's strongest rival for the
Democratic presidential nomination in 2000. Gephardt has maintained
a vigorous travel schedule, which includes frequent visits to New
Hampshire, site of the nation's first presidential primary, and to
Iowa, which holds the first caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Nichols, a spokeswoman for Gephardt, said that he does not
intend to decide about a presidential run until the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the impression that he and Gore have smoothed out
some of their differences gives each of them a chance to look
statesmanlike at a time when Democrats fear that the scandal could
cost them votes or hold down the Democratic turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their respective positions, Gore and Gephardt have
more recently maintained a cordial working relationship. Aides to
both men say they began drawing closer after a long-scheduled
dinner on Jan. 24 _ three days after the scandal broke _ at the
vice president's home in northwest Washington, where he and his
wife, Tipper, showed Gephardt and his wife, Jane, pictures from
their wedding album. Since then, the men have met for lunch about
every six weeks, aides say.
</P>
<P>
   And in recent weeks, they have appeared together at Democratic
party events, like the Unity '98 dinner Friday night in Gephardt's
hometown of St. Louis, as they concluded a long day of campaigning
together in the area.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis Friday, Gore said of his relationship with
Gephardt: ``We have been friends for 22 years. We fight for the
same things. And what we are fighting for right now is Democratic
control of the U.S. Congress so that we can move forward into the
21st century with an agenda that makes sense for the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said: ``I think the party is unified, and we are as
unified as we have ever been. We see these issues eye to eye.''
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, who is widely perceived as the front-runner for the
2000 nomination, the advantages of an improved relationship with
Gephardt beyond the November elections are obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Activists in Iowa and New Hampshire have long memories,'' said
Martin Hamburger, a Democratic media consultant who is not working
for either man. ``If it looks like the rivalry is out of hand, that
hurts Gore. This gives him room to look magnanimous.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to both men said Gore has campaigned with several
congressional candidates at the request of Gephardt, including two
representatives from Minnesota, David Minge and Bruce Vento, who
generally face strong opposition from Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   At Gephardt's request, Gore also joined him Friday for a private
meeting with executives from high-tech companies in the St. Louis
area.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gephardt has reciprocated with at least one major
effort. Democratic House members say he played a leading role in
holding down the number of Democrats, to 31, who voted last week
for the Republicans' proposal for impeachment hearings after a
Democratic-sponsored plan was defeated. That not only aided
Clinton, but also Gore as a Clinton loyalist.

BRAZIL PLANS $20 BILLION IN TAX HIKES, BUDGET CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil _ As a three-man economic team headed for
Washington, and President Fernando Henrique Cardoso flew off to
Portugal, Brazilian government officials put the finishing touches
Friday on an ambitious package to raise $20 billion in revenues
through spending cuts and tax increases next year.
</P>
<P>
   But public announcement of those measures, eagerly awaited by
investors and markets throughout Latin America, appear set for
delay once again. Details of Brazil's plans to reduce its high
deficits, initially expected to be announced just after Cardoso's
Oct. 5 re-election, and then on Oct. 20, now will likely not be
disclosed before the second round of gubernatorial elections Oct.
25, legislators said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the economic collapse of Russia in August, investors and
economists have sharpened their focus on Brazil. While President
Clinton lobbied Congress for $18 billion to restock the
International Monetary Fund this week, with an eye toward assisting
Brazil, the team that returned here from the IMF's annual meeting
in Washington earlier this month scoured government accounts for
politically feasible sources of savings and reform.
</P>
<P>
   Though the country has sped up various receipts the government
is getting for privatizing state entities like the phone system to
replenish foreign reserves, it is losing more than $400 million a
day from central bank coffers. Foreign reserves, which had stood at
$70 billion, are down to $46 billion, with capital flight
surpassing $30 billion despite the government's doubling of
interest rates to more than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Three senior government officials, Pedro Parente and Amaury Bier
of the Finance Ministry and Altamir Lopes of the central bank, are
scheduled to meet this weekend with IMF officials in Washington to
discuss the government's blueprint for cutbacks and reforms.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Eager to avoid replaying the contentious and unpopular IMF
accords of the 1980s, Brazilian officials are trying to
disassociate the hardship to come from the IMF. The steps to cut
the budget deficit are being portrayed as measures to rehabilitate
the economic systems. In that way, the administration here hopes to
avoid the humiliation of appearing to bend economic policy to IMF
orders once again.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF goal corresponds to a 2.5 percent to 3 percent surplus
in Brazil's primary budget account, which covers government
expenses but excludes interest payments on debt. ``It will be
drastic, but we have to deliver that,'' said Demosthenes Madureiro
do Pinho, the director of international relations at the Brazilian
central bank. Higher interest rates on the national debt are
bringing the cost of the debt to 3.5 percent of Brazil's economy,
Pinho said, adding that spending reforms are key to restoring
confidence and, ultimately, lowering interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In August, before Russia's economic collapse triggered a swift
and sizable flight of capital from Brazil, the government had
presented a budget for next year with a primary account surplus of
0.92 percent, or $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A senior official at the Planning Ministry, Martus Tavares, says
there is little room for the federal government to reduce its
budget by much more. So the government will depend on tax increases
and savings by states and municipalities to raise the remaining $14
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government will likely create new taxes, increase
existing ones and consolidate others to raise more revenues, though
economists warn that an expected deepening of the recession in
Brazil bodes ill for tax revenues. Michel Temer, president of the
lower house of Parliament, said in an interview here that Congress
would begin debate on social security reform Nov. 4, and would
begin what promises to be a stormy debate on political reform soon
after.
</P>
<P>
   The measures being discussed include a 0.1 percent increase on a
special government tax on every check written, to 0.3 percent.
Congress passed the tax in 1996 as a one-year effort to improve the
deteriorating public health system, but the revenue has been used
to offset excess spending in other areas. Last year, the tax
brought in $7 billion. With a 0.1 percent increase, it will likely
bring in another $3 billion, and it would be made permanent.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year plan of adjustments also relies on states and
municipalities to produce about 30 percent of the projected savings
through legally-mandated spending limits, though states have had a
spotty record in controlling outlays.
</P>
<P>
   While Cardoso clearly interpreted his victory this month as a
mandate for swift, if painful, reforms, it is by no means clear
that state governors are hearing the same message from voters. In
gubernatorial races in key Brazilian states, Brazilians are
favoring candidates that are not particularly known for austerity.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Alderson maneuvered his 9-year-old Ford Tempo through the
snow, parking beside the federal courthouse in Butte, Mont.
Alderson, a small-town hospital accountant, left the heat on,
telling his wife, Connie, to wait in the car. He was sure it would
only take a moment to file his lawsuit on behalf of the United
States, charging four giant hospital companies with fraud.
</P>
<P>
   For years before that January morning in 1993, Alderson stewed
with the belief that the companies _ the huge Hospital Corp. of
America and three of its corporate spinoffs _ had cheated the
government with bogus expense claims. While working at a Montana
hospital run by one of those companies, Alderson himself had been
asked to create a second set of books recording different expenses
than those reported to the government. He had refused, saying it
was unethical.
</P>
<P>
   Then his world fell apart. Alderson was forced out of his job.
No longer able to afford the comfortable life of his resort
hometown of Whitefish, his family moved to a cramped apartment in
rural Montana. Some college savings for his two teen-age children
were eaten up. His career in hospital financial management seemed
to be dwindling to a uncertain end.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he could not let go of his anger at the hospital giants for
actions he felt sure were illegal. So when a friend described the
federal whistle-blower law that allows private citizens to file
fraud actions on behalf of the United States, Alderson decided to
act, drafting his own lawsuit against the companies and then making
this drive to Butte to file it under seal in court. It was a battle
so farfetched _ one man versus four huge corporations _ that Don
Quixote's odds against the windmills seemed better.
</P>
<P>
   But, at least for now, Alderson has gotten the best of his
windmills. The filing of his lawsuit _ known as a qui tam, or false
claims, case _ was the flash point for an almost six-year legal
battle, one that led to criminal and civil investigations that have
rocked the entire hospital industry.
</P>
<P>
   Those efforts culminated this month with the unsealing of
Alderson's lawsuit and the announcement by the government that it
was joining him as a plaintiff against the Columbia/HCA Healthcare
Corp. and the Quorum Health Group _ the corporate defendants that
emerged from years of industry consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   Lost amid the tumult was the story of Alderson, now 52. Since
the day he filed his lawsuit, he and his family have been silent
about it, restricted from letting even friends or relatives know
about Alderson's secret life working with law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Alderson is telling his story. In a
wide-ranging series of interviews, he described the events that led
him to conclude that the hospital giants were engaged in fraud. And
he spoke of the long road he followed from the day the suit was
filed until the government publicly declared that it believed he
was right. That means Alderson could share in as much as 25 percent
of any recovery _ an amount that could easily reach into the
millions.
</P>
<P>
   Alderson's unusual story was also pieced together through court
and corporate records, as well as interviews with family members,
business acquaintances, lawyers and friends _ most of whom marveled
that this seemingly ordinary man could achieve such an
extraordinary outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, a discovery made by one man at a small rural hospital
ultimately unraveled a nationwide, systemwide scheme,'' said
Stephen Meagher, a former prosecutor who was eventually hired by
Alderson to handle the case. ``It shows how one person can truly
make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The Early Days _ From the Start, Not Willing to Quit
</P>
<P>
   The 10-year-olds skied down the slope of the Montana mountain,
weaving gracefully through the gates. Every child but one reached
the bottom in a flash. But the last boy stopped when he missed a
gate, slowly walked sideways up the slope back to it, and skied
through. Again and again, he repeated the move, each time he missed
a gate.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes later, when he finished that 1956 race, James
Alderson was confronted by grumbling from impatient skiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know you were supposed to quit,'' Alderson said
recently. It was a trait that would play a role in his eventual
journey into whistle-blowing.
</P>
<P>
   He worked throughout his teen-age years, and while attending
Montana State University he decided to commit himself to
accounting. Working for Arthur Andersen &AMP; Co. during college, he
remembers being asked one day to bring an audit to a partner for
signature. He watched, enthralled, as the partner brought out a
fountain pen and a blotter with a big flourish.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just sensed that this ceremony meant that this was quality
work,'' he said. ``It just meant to me that if I ever signed
anything as an accountant, it had better be right. And whenever I
did sign audit reports, I always flashed back to that first time.''
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1970s, Alderson, married and with a new daughter,
decided to move to a slower life in Whitefish, a ski town in
Montana's northwest corner.
</P>
<P>
   He opened an accounting practice, and business built quickly.
Soon, his clients included the local hospital, North Valley. By
1984, when the hospital needed a finance officer, Alderson was
offered the job.
</P>
<P>
   For six years, he handled the hospital's affairs. But in 1990,
Dale Jessup, the top administrator, moved on, and the hospital
board decided to turn to a management company. Executives from
Quorum, which had recently spun off from HCA, traveled to Whitefish
to make a presentation.
</P>
<P>
   They described how their purchasing power could save the
hospital huge sums on supplies. Moreover, they said, Quorum's
financial experts would be able to obtain maximum reimbursement for
hospital expenses filed with the government through what is known
as the cost-reporting system.
</P>
<P>
   The board was impressed, and in the summer of 1990 Quorum was
selected to run North Valley. It was a decision that would change
Alderson's life.
</P>
<P>
   The Choice _ A New Administrator, A Troubling Question
</P>
<P>
   It was a late September afternoon in 1990, about two months
after Quorum had assumed management of North Valley. Alderson was
meeting with a consultant who helped prepare the hospital's
government cost report when Clyde Eder, a Quorum administrator,
stepped into the room.
</P>
<P>
   Eder asked the two men whether they usually prepared two cost
reports. They were uncertain what he meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `No, we just prepare one cost report,''' the
consultant, Jack Schisel, recalled in an interview. ``I thought he
was talking about maybe preparing one for Medicaid and a different
one for Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Eder meant something quite different. Quorum submitted
aggressive cost reports to the government, claiming the largest
possible number of expenses. But in case a later audit rejected
those claims, the company also assembled a second set of more
conservative reports for its internal use. Those reports estimated
how much of the filed report could potentially be reversed; that
amount of money was kept in reserve. Then, if the standard two-year
period in which an audit could occur, the hospital could book the
reserves as revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Alderson bristled at what he heard. ``I told him I never did two
tax returns for anyone when I was an accountant,'' he said, ``and I
wasn't going to do two cost reports.''
</P>
<P>
   Eder seemed bewildered by the response, but left without much
further comment. The two Montana accountants looked at each other.
``Then I said to Jim, `Boy, that sounds a bit like fraud,'''
Schisel said. ``And Jim agreed.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Quorum said Eder was unavailable. In a
deposition, Eder said that he did not remember this specific
encounter. But he acknowledged the existence of the reserve
reports, which he called ``common in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days after the encounter, Alderson was on a Quorum
managers trip in Juneau, Alaska. During breakfast Sunday morning,
he said, Eder told him that he was being dismissed. In a
deposition, Eder denied dismissing Alderson, saying that he was
offering advice on what he needed to do to keep his job.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Alderson returned to Montana a wrecked man. ``My
sister and I picked him up from the airport, and he just looked
distraught,'' said Justin Alderson, Alderson's son, who is now 22.
``He told us he had been fired, and I remember asking what we were
going to do. His response was, `I don't know, but we'll figure
something out.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Alderson could not find another job in Whitefish that paid
enough; eventually, he took a financial position with a small
hospital in the rural town of Dillon, Mont. He and his family hated
it.
</P>
<P>
   But the more he thought about what had happened in Whitefish,
the angrier he became. He was sure he had been forced out because
of his refusal to keep two sets of records. Worse, he realized that
Quorum used accounting handbooks of its former parent, HCA. If
Quorum manipulated cost reports, he thought, HCA must as well.
</P>
<P>
   He filed a wrongful termination lawsuit and demanded copies of
reserve reports and related records. The documents seemed to back
up his worst fears. But the suggestions of wrongdoing during that
case's depositions _ which have never before been made public _
outraged hospital lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're on a fishing expedition,'' James Heckathorn, a hospital
lawyer, told him during a 1992 deposition. Heckathorn demanded to
know what details Alderson had to ``make these serious allegations
against North Valley Hospital that they're performing unlawful
acts.''
</P>
<P>
   About that time, Alderson phoned Jessup, the hospital's former
administrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me what Quorum was doing, and I told him it sounded
fraudulent to me,'' Jessup said in a recent interview. ``And I told
him I had just heard about a case in California, called a qui tam
case, which allowed an individual to file a fraud suit on behalf of
the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Alderson hung up the phone with new resolve. He had never heard
of qui tam cases and knew little of the federal whistle-blower law.
But he decided that he was going to learn whatever he could about
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Lawsuit _ Bringing in Help From the Government
</P>
<P>
   In December 1992, Alderson sat at a desk in his home office,
addressing an envelope to William Barr, then the attorney general
of the United States. The draft of the lawsuit he had written was
ready for review by the government.
</P>
<P>
   From his research at a law library in Missoula, about 175 miles
away, Alderson knew he had to notify the government of his case
before filing it, and he decided to go directly to the top. Once
the envelope was ready, he headed down to post office and dropped
it in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   To his family, it seemed almost absurd. ``I thought he was
crazy,'' said Connie Alderson. ``The whole thing had just kind of
consumed him.''
</P>
<P>
   But by her husband's reading of the law, the government had 60
days to decide whether to join the lawsuit and then take over. The
Aldersons figured the wait would not be hard. ``I thought that
asking for 60 days of your life wasn't any big deal,'' Mrs.
Alderson said, adding, ``It's been a long 60 days since then.''
</P>
<P>
   Days after it was sent, the draft complaint landed on the desk
of Marie O'Connell, a lawyer in the Justice Department's civil
division in Washington. She telephoned Alderson, telling him that
the government could not begin investigating until he filed the
complaint under seal and suggested that he do so at the federal
courthouse in Butte.
</P>
<P>
   Alderson did, and then he sent Ms. O'Connell copies of the
cost-report documents obtained in his wrongful-termination case.
Ms. O'Connell had referred the matter to the inspector general in
the Department of Health and Human Services. A federal
investigation was under way.
</P>
<P>
   In March, with those 60 days almost up, Ms. O'Connell called
again. There was a lot still to investigate, she said, and she
hoped he would not oppose a government motion for an extension.
``Man, I said that sounds fine,'' Alderson recalled, ``because at
least they didn't say `no.'''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation seemed to pick up speed in May, when Ms.
O'Connell hooked Alderson into a conference call with an
investigator from the inspector general's office. To Alderson, they
seemed excited about the case and ready to act. Just days later,
the government served Quorum with subpoenas seeking years of cost
reports and reserve reports.
</P>
<P>
   As the documents came in, boxes of materials were sent to
Alderson for review. His home was overrun with bankers' boxes
stuffed with cost reports, each of which Alderson sat down and
analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember him coming home after work, sitting down at an old
386 computer, and just making spreadsheet after spreadsheet,'' said
Justin Alderson. ``It was almost like his second full-time job.''
</P>
<P>
   By August, investigators decided they needed to meet with
Alderson; in turn, he decided he needed a cost report expert to
help explain the case to the government. He hired Nicholas Bordeau,
a former Medicare auditor who worked as an accountant.
</P>
<P>
   After Bordeau signed a confidentiality agreement, Alderson
showed him the documents. To Bordeau, the records demonstrated a
scheme to misrepresent expenses to the government to illegally
increase reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe what I was seeing,'' Bordeau said. ``I
thought it was a Medicare auditor's worst nightmare. It was an
organized system to take advantage of the Medicare system.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In August, at Alderson's expense, the men flew to Washington to
meet with investigators. Back home in Montana, Alderson's family
told friends who asked that he had gone to visit his brother.
</P>
<P>
   The two men walked through security at the Justice Department
and were whisked to a meeting room filled with investigators.
Alderson made a presentation to the assembled group, explaining
what he had learned. Afterward, the investigators questioned
Bordeau about the arcane practices at issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were full of doubt,'' Bordeau said. ``They were saying it
was too complex, that they doubted that it really happened. But I
was so sure. I just kept hammering away at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the meeting, Alderson decided he needed his own
lawyer to push along the government lawyers. With his own money, he
flew to Kansas City and hired a law firm, but one with little
experience with qui tam cases.
</P>
<P>
   With the case slogging through the Justice Department, Justin
Alderson bought a present to lift his father's spirits: a pen
engraved with a family motto for tough competitions: ``Keep your
head down.'' He told his father to use the pen only to sign the
settlement papers when the case was eventually resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Alderson put the pen away, vowing not to touch it again until
that day.
</P>
<P>
   The Lawyer _ New Life Breathed Into the Lawsuit
</P>
<P>
   Jim Alderson first saw Stephen Meagher's name late in 1995, in a
news-clipping. The former federal prosecutor worked with the San
Francisco office of Phillips &AMP; Cohen, a law firm that specialized
in qui tam suits; he was quoted in an article about Medicare fraud.
This, Alderson decided, was the lawyer he needed.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the investigation had stretched on almost three years.
Every defendant but Quorum had been purchased by the burgeoning
Columbia Healthcare Corp., and Alderson felt the government had
missed an opportunity to strike a settlement before those deals
were done. He flew to California to tell his story to Meagher and
his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen few plaintiffs as prepared, and as prepared to be
relentless, as Alderson,'' Meagher said. ``He made a very
persuasive case.''
</P>
<P>
   Meagher took the case, which to Alderson seemed the best hope of
salvaging his efforts. He had made many sacrifices by then.
Attending a seemingly endless stream of government meetings, he had
missed everything from some of his son's football games to being at
his mother's side on the day she died. Visits to his daughter,
Jennifer, at college became opportunities for research at the law
library.
</P>
<P>
   Meagher set to work putting new life in the case. After
conducting his own investigation, in the summer of 1996 he got in
touch with Joseph Ford, an agent he knew with the Federal Bureau of
Investigation in Florida. With information Meagher provided, the
FBI began a criminal investigation of cost-reporting fraud by
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Within two months, Meagher filed a new complaint in the case and
later moved it to Florida. The precedents on cost-reporting fraud
were particularly strong there, and, because of the elderly
population, juries were more sympathetic to allegations of Medicare
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, the civil and criminal investigations were moving
rapidly. In July, FBI agents raided Columbia hospitals in six
states. Weeks later, three Columbia executives in Florida were
indicted for cost-reporting fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Alderson, who by the beginning of this year had moved for a job
with a group of Oregon hospitals, watched in awe what his efforts
had wrought. His family began clipping news articles and taping
television shows about the scandal. For the first time,
cost-reporting fraud was the talk of the health care industry.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the developments, the government asked for more
extensions in Alderson's qui tam lawsuit. Sixty days had become
five years, and the family wondered if the seal on the case would
ever be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, early this month, on Oct. 2, Alderson heard the news
from Meagher: the government had officially joined the case. The
lawsuit would be unsealed on Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   The Aldersons were scheduled to be with friends in Las Vegas,
Nev., that day. Alderson woke at the motel there at 5:30 in the
morning, and anxiously turned on the television to watch for news
of the unsealing. Once the news broke, the Aldersons telephoned
friends and family, explaining away the stories they had been
forced to tell for years.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Alderson made the call that most worried him _ to a board
member of one of the hospitals where he worked. He feared his new
fame as a whistle-blower would ruin his chance to continue in the
industry. But the board member put those concerns at ease. All
Alderson's role in the case proved, the board member said, was that
the hospitals had picked the right man to run their finances
honestly.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Alderson and his family refuse to speculate on how much
money they might share in if, as expected, there is a settlement in
his long-fought case.
</P>
<P>
   But Alderson is confident of one thing: He expects that,
sometime soon, he will fetch the gift pen from his son, and use it
for the first and only time.

<TEXT>
<P>
   RIZO DE ORO, Mexico _ Everywhere in this village in the verdant
canyons of Chiapas State there are subtle signs of the presence of
the Zapatista rebel army.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the men wear untattered olive green pants and
strong-soled combat boots, a kind of informal uniform that the
Zapatista organization has encouraged its followers to adopt.
Government signs on the one-room schoolhouse have been covered over
with fresh paint.
</P>
<P>
   When strangers approach seeking information, villagers turn away
and put their fingers to their lips to warn each other to keep
quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently the Zapatistas moved openly here. Almost four
years ago, when they were riding a surge of popularity after
staging a brief armed uprising, they set up their own
administration in a town a few miles away down a rocky dirt road.
This village and a dozen others in the surrounding rain forest
chose to join the new alternative township.
</P>
<P>
   The town had gone by the name of Amparo Agua Tinta, but the
Zapatistas rebaptized it Land and Liberty, taking the battle cry of
Emiliano Zapata, the Mexican revolutionary of the early 20th
century from whom the guerrillas draw their name.
</P>
<P>
   The cowed authorities from the government's political party, the
Institutional Revolutionary Party or PRI, quietly stepped aside to
make way for the new Zapatista mayor. The Zapatista authorities
resolved disputes and issued birth, death and marriage
certificates. They even set up a three-cell county jail.
</P>
<P>
   But on May 1, the police and the army occupied the town, drove
out the Zapatista officials and burned down the jail. More than 40
Zapatistas were arrested, of whom 8 remain in prison. It was one of
four government operations in recent months to destroy Zapatista
town governments, a campaign that rebel leaders labeled ``one of
the most ferocious offensives we have ever faced.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Zapatistas in Rizo de Oro, and in scores of other
villages across the Indian regions of Chiapas, have gone quiet.
Once they held noisy rallies and blocked the highways with marches.
They went about in bandanas or black ski masks that hid their faces
but publicized their identities as Zapatistas.
</P>
<P>
   But since June the Zapatistas have suspended their
demonstrations, taken down their banners and put away their masks.
And from disciplined militants to casual followers, every Indian
villager who has anything to do with the Zapatista National
Liberation Army is under instructions from the movement's leaders
to avoid outsiders, especially reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are thinking of setting up our township again somewhere
else,'' said Rafael Aguilar Santiz, 22, a Tojolabal Indian corn
farmer in Rizo de Oro. After looking over two strangers at great
length, he added warily: ``If we do, we might tell people about it.
But probably we won't.''
</P>
<P>
   The retreat from public view is a sharp turnabout for the
Zapatistas, a guerrilla group that has always emphasized political
over military combat.
</P>
<P>
   After only a week of amateurish fighting in January 1994, the
rebels' chief strategist, who goes by the nom de guerre
Subcommander Marcos, acknowledged that the show of armed force had
been largely symbolic, intended to dramatize the Zapatistas'
demands for better justice for Indians.
</P>
<P>
   A cease-fire soon went into effect, and the Zapatistas have
observed it ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of shooting, the Zapatistas set about creating civilian
political organizations in Chiapas. These have included not just
alternative townships, but also rural labor unions and associations
of their Roman Catholic supporters in the local diocese _ which has
backed the Zapatista cause, although not its armed tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Peace talks with the government collapsed in late 1996, with the
Zapatistas accusing the government of reneging on signed
commitments. But the Zapatistas' grass-roots groups continued to
spread.
</P>
<P>
   The government tolerated those groups until this year, when
President Ernesto Zedillo decided that the alternative townships
were a threat to the legal order in the state and began a political
and military offensive against them.
</P>
<P>
   The government has also tried to show the Indians of Chiapas
that it has more to offer them than the Zapatistas. While Rizo de
Oro remained relatively quiet, nearby Amparo Agua Tinta, the seat
of the former Zapatista township, bustled with government-financed
activity after the May 1 takeover.
</P>
<P>
   The streets were crowded with dump trucks and bulldozers sent in
by the state government to pave soggy streets. A mobile health
clinic stood in the central square. Public buildings shone with
fresh coats of paint.
</P>
<P>
   Many villagers displayed their gratitude at being rescued from
years of government neglect by painting the PRI insignia
prominently on their houses. But some remained skeptical of the
government's largesse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never had any difficulty with the Zapatista authorities,''
said Elias Mendez Agueda, 30, even though he admitted to being a
PRI loyalist. ``The government wanted them out. We didn't have
anything to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   President Zedillo argues that his policies have laid the
groundwork for the peace talks to resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government wants a dialogue, right now,'' Zedillo said
emphatically during a trip to Chiapas in late July. ``Those who
believe that the government wants war are completely mistaken. They
who propagate that idea,'' he said of the Zapatistas, ``are lost in
the emptiness of their own fantasies.''
</P>
<P>
   But in practice the government's actions have driven the
Zapatistas farther from the negotiating table and deep into a
secrecy that seems intended primarily to make it more difficult for
government troops and intelligence operatives to monitor their
activities.
</P>
<P>
   (The administration of Land and Liberty gave one recent signal
that it is still operating in exile by putting out a message on the
Internet calling for emergency aid for villagers in the region
whose homes were destroyed in floods in September.)
</P>
<P>
   Although this small village is buried in backlands many miles
from the nearest telephone, people here are keenly aware that they
are locked in a sophisticated conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Recently PRI leaders in the region leaked a false report to the
press that Rizo de Oro had been host to a formal ceremony to
re-establish the shattered Zapatista township. The PRI followers
apparently hoped the ruse would draw army troops into this
Zapatista town.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilar, the farmer, contemplated taking advantage of the
strangers' visit to set the record straight that no such ceremony
had taken place. With a gesture signaling the visitors to wait, he
disappeared for consultations with other, unseen villagers,
presumably local Zapatista leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago the Zapatistas might have been eager to air their
grievances and propagate their political views. But this time
Aguilar returned to say that local rebels had chosen silence. His
goodbye was curt: ``We have nothing more to say.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hours after Darryl Strawberry was released from
Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center Friday, he spoke happily about
being able to play with his two young children, joked about eating
a small amount of chicken and potatoes and sounded relieved to be
at home in Fort Lee, N.J., instead of in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really feeling good,'' said Strawberry, in a telephone
interview. ``It's nice to be home with the kids and to just kick
back. That's all that I'm going to do. This feels good.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, who underwent surgery to remove a cancer from his
colon on Oct. 3, said he will remain in New Jersey for another 10
or 12 days before returning home to Rancho Mirage, Calif. The
36-year old outfielder, who lost a significant amount of weight
from his 215-pound frame, said he does not have enough strength to
attend any of the World Series games and is content watching his
teammates play the Padres on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart is with them,'' said Strawberry, who spoke to several
Yankees after they won the American League championship. ``I'm just
going to relax at home and watch the game. I'm looking forward to
it. I may not be there, but it'll feel like I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill echoed the sentiments of many Yankees by saying,
``Everything we're going through is game. This is his life. Any
time we get some good news about Darryl it's uplifting. We're all
praying for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Since cancerous cells were found in one of the 36 lymph nodes
removed from his abdomen during the operation, Strawberry said
doctors told him he will need six months of chemotherapy treatment
once he returns to California. The 36-year-old outfielder said
doctors told him he will need one treatment of at least one hour a
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never scared,'' said Strawberry. ``I was more emotional
than anything. At the time of it, I had played for a while with
this. I wanted to keep playing because I knew we were going to get
into the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Strawberry stopped and laughed, probably because
the Yankees had made it to the World Series as he expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be there because that's what you play for,'' said
Strawberry. ``I don't think that I was ever scared. It's something
that I wanted to deal with head on. I talked to Eric Davis about
the chemo. He said it's not as bad as some people say.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the discovery of cancer in one lymph node proved that
the cancer had spread, Strawberry remained optimistic about his
future and said, ``It didn't worry me. I got all the information
from the doctors. One out of 36 is good. It wasn't spreading. It
didn't run off and get crazy like cancer can.''
</P>
<P>
   When Strawberry was released from the hospital in a wheelchair
Friday, a few hundred fans who had congregated chanted, ``Darryl,
Darryl.'' Strawberry, who struggled not to cry, hugged a few
nurses, thanked everyone for supporting him, then rose from the
wheelchair and carefully entered a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, I never thought this day would come,'' Strawberry said.
``But it has.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike David Wells, Saturday night's starter in the World Series
who predicted the Yankees would throttle the Padres in five games,
Strawberry refused to make a prediction about whether he will soon
be getting his third World Series ring. But Strawberry, who is
still hopeful about returning to play in 1999, sounded very
confident in the 1998 Yankees, who are wearing his number 39 on the
back of their caps as inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look really good,'' said Strawberry.'' It's not going to
be easy, but I think they're ready. The best thing about making it
to the World Series is you know you don't have to go anywhere else
after that. You've made it to that point and then you go do the
best you can do. That's what it's all about.''

COMMENTARY: `CORPUS CHRISTI' D.O.A.  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Culture wars may come and go, but some things don't change:
Culture wars are almost never about culture, and are almost always
more dramatic, more entertaining and more farcical than the
supposedly incendiary art works that ignite them.
</P>
<P>
   As Ben Brantley wrote in his dead-on Times review of Terrence
McNally's long-debated ``gay Jesus'' play, ``Corpus Christi,'' when
it actually opened this week, ``The excitement stops right after
the metal detectors.'' It was all too predictable that the show
that sparked dozens of tabloid headlines, raucous protests and
pious counterprotests sight unseen would prove not only to be
stupefyingly dull but also less sacrilegious than ``Jesus Christ
Superstar'' once viewed in the flesh. (And not much flesh at that.)
The whole incident is nothing if not a replay of three decades ago
when police were summoned to handle armies of warring protesters at
the Broadway opening of ``The Deputy,'' a play that questioned Pope
Pius XII's moral courage during the Holocaust. The only bomb was on
stage, but the publicity turned the show, now forgotten, into a
quasi-hit and earned its producer a Tony for his courage.
</P>
<P>
   As a political football, ``Corpus Christi'' has sold out its run
and given the theater its biggest media windfall in years. Local TV
news led with the story. The conservative New York Post went so far
as to supplement its secular pan with a second, clerical review to
denounce the blasphemy; the liberal online magazine Slate,
heretofore not known for its drama criticism, was so eager to weigh
in on ``Corpus Christi'' that it ran its pan days before the
official opening.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even McNally's play is not the culture-war pinata to receive
the most disproportionate attention in relation to its tiny
cultural weight this fall. That honor falls to ``The Secret Diary
of Desmond Pfeiffer,'' an utterly vacuous TV sitcom that has been
as loudly protested by the African-American left as ``Corpus
Christi'' has been by the religious right. The sex-addled ``Desmond
Pfeiffer'' is set in the Lincoln White House but is about the
Clinton White House. Its title character, a fictional black English
butler, is the only one on screen who sounds like a rational adult
rather than a burlesque refugee from the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its nominal historical period, this show has no more to
do with race or the Civil War than does ``Married With Children.''
But that didn't stop the Beverly Hills-Hollywood branch of the
NAACP from marching on Paramount, the show's producer, to protest
its supposed trivialization of slavery. Jesse Jackson joined in,
demanding the series be taken ``off the air.'' The L.A. City
Council, fearing the show could ``fan the flames of racial
discord,'' unanimously passed a resolution directing the city's
Human Rights Commission to investigate it. One black activist,
Danny Bakewell _ sounding just like the Catholic League in its
protests of ``Corpus Christi'' _ has argued that no one would treat
the Holocaust as irreverently as ``Desmond Pfeiffer'' has allegedly
mocked slavery. Apparently he's unaware of ``Hogan's Heroes'' or
Mel Brooks, who has made light of the Holocaust, the Spanish
Inquisition AND slavery in ``The Producers'' and ``History of the
World, Part I.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to mimic the right's knee-jerk demagoguery about ``Corpus
Christi,'' commentators on the left have eagerly condemned
``Desmond Pfeiffer'' without actually seeing it. And as the
protests turned McNally's play into a temporary hit, the ink
spilled over ``Desmond Pfeiffer'' has kept it alive despite dismal
reviews and ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Who behaves worse in these symbolic controversies, the left or
the right? This month the edge goes to the right. In all the debate
over freedom of speech sparked by both ``Corpus Christi'' and
``Desmond Pfeiffer,'' only one person has actually been silenced.
At the conservative P.C. paper The Washington Times _ which ran Pat
Buchanan's pre-opening assault on ``Corpus Christi'' and has even
managed to smoke out anti-American and anti-Christian sentiment in
``Saving Private Ryan'' _ the editor refused to let his longtime
drama critic, Nelson Pressley, review the McNally play at all.
Pressley didn't like the play any more than most critics, but he
quit his job rather than submit to censorship. If there is any
casualty in these culture wars besides common sense, artistic
standards and countless trees, he alone is it.

EVEN IN THE BEST OF TIMES, REACHING A BUDGET ACCORD IS A SOMETIME
THING 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CONGRESS-SPEND, CONGRESS-PORN)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time in decades, Congress and the
White House negotiated tax and spending legislation this year with
the budget in surplus. The result was chaos.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers were never able to agree on a budget resolution _
the framework into which all the tax and spending bills are
supposed to fit. This had not happened since congressional budget
procedures were established in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Then, without the discipline of such an overall plan, the Senate
and the House could not pass eight of the 13 spending bills needed
to keep the government running. So the lawmakers had to stay in
session more than a week longer than they had hoped. Finally, they
lumped all eight bills together this week and announced an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But the only way they could get this far was to resort to
gimmicks. One was to designate $20 billion as ``emergency''
expenditures so that programs did not have to be cut elsewhere to
offset the new spending. This will use up more than one-quarter of
the anticipated budget surplus in the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Another gimmick extended the tax break for Individual Retirement
Accounts to couples with incomes from $100,000 to $150,000. This
will actually raise a small amount of revenue in the next five
years _ the period covered by budget accounting _ but it will make
the picture considerably worse in later years.
</P>
<P>
   As hard as it was to negotiate a budget in the bad old days of
budget deficits, say the politicians involved, it was exponentially
more difficult this year. At least in years past, there was a
common goal. As much as they disagreed on policy and principle,
they were all aiming at a reduction in the deficit.
</P>
<P>
   This year, some members of Congress wanted to use the surplus
for a big tax cut. Others wanted to pay off the national debt.
Others wanted to spend part of it on medical research, schools and
weapons for the Pentagon. Others wanted to spend large sums on
highways. Still others wanted to continue cutting government
spending.
</P>
<P>
   And that was just among the Republicans. The Democrats had their
own ideas about the budget, and President Clinton laid down his
marker about saving the surplus until a way was found to shore up
the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   ``In budget terms,'' said Robert Reischauer, a former director
of the congressional budget office, ``this is like the end of the
Cold War.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There are other differences as well in the way things were
negotiated with the budget in a surplus. In 1990, 1993 and 1995,
when politicians staked their careers on striking a budget deal to
lower the deficit, the fundamental question was how to divide up
the bitter medicine of more taxes and less spending.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, for the most part, opposed tax increases and
favored cutting spending on social programs. Democrats wanted to
raise taxes, especially on the rich, and protect social spending.
In the end, balances were carefully drawn. But plenty of
politicians _ President George Bush, to name one _ lost their jobs
in the process.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with Democrats and Republicans alike claiming
victory, the burning issue was how to parcel out the candy.
Democrats got more money for education and farm assistance.
Republicans got more money for the military and an extension of
popular tax breaks for businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the $20 billion that will eat into the surplus really
will go for emergencies, like relief for victims of Hurricane
Georges. But much of the money, like the $90 million that will pay
for six new helicopters for the national police in Colombia to use
in drug interdiction, was designated emergency spending simply
because there was no other way to get it into the budget.
</P>
<P>
   For the politicians, the new way is more fun. It is hard to
imagine that anyone will be voted out of office because of this
year's budget. But that did not make it easier to reach an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The other big difference is that the principal fights this year
were not over money at all. They involved delicate policy issues
like needle exchanges, contraception, global warming, immigration
and the census.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, there is no consensus on these matters. So the only
way policy could be set was to wrap them into the giant spending
bill. It may be more pleasant to debate policy than money. But it
is probably harder to find a way to split the difference.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the surplus lasts, the lack of discipline that
characterized the budget-writing this year is likely to continue.
This is distressing to those devoted to controlling government
spending. ``The temptation,'' said L. Ari Fleischer, spokesman for
the House Ways and Means Committee, ``is to grab the loot and spend
it.''

THE ONLY ISSUE IN THE CASINOS ELECTION IS FAIRNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kansas City's business community is right to
support the Nov. 3 constitutional initiative that would allow
business to continue as usual for Missouri casinos in man-made
lagoons adjacent to rivers.
</P>
<P>
   The Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce is careful not to
champion gambling while coming out for approval of Amendment 9,
which would legalize ``boats in moats.'' The chamber characterizes
its endorsement of the issue as recognition of the unfairness of
changing the rules after casino companies made their investments.
</P>
<P>
   Those who sought loopholes in the law in their effort to destroy
the state's gaming industry have forced the vote by successfully
challenging the legality of building some riverboat casinos outside
the river channel. The casinos so situated were placed away from
the river for reasons involving convenience and safety, but doing
so made them vulnerable to those who would manipulate the law's
language to their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The need for voter revision of the law turns mostly on the slot
machine trade, which is the life's blood of any casino's
profitability. If the constitutional authorization for casinos
isn't revised to fully cover boats in moats, these operations would
lose their franchise to feature games of chance, of which slots are
the most lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the casinos present themselves as virtuous, but the
virtue of their position is difficult to discern. Hundreds of
millions of dollars were invested in Missouri in response to what
everyone involved perceived to be a legalization of all forms of
gambling. Clever use of a legal loophole has put the viability of
that investment in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that gambling is objectionable to some doesn't make it
virtuous to attempt to render investment in casinos nearly
worthless. People are certainly free to make their moral judgments
concerning gambling, and to forgo gambling if they consider it
immoral.
</P>
<P>
   However, translating moral qualms about gambling into efforts to
deprive others of the constructive use of their private resources
is an act of questionable morality. Beyond this, it jeopardizes the
bedrock principle on which free-market capitalism rests, which is
the sanctity of private property.
</P>
<P>
   When the United States emerged as a geopolitical entity, it was
unique in the degree of legal protection it provided for private
property. As such, it was one of the few places in the world where
the law protected citizens from the deprivation of the fruits of
their labor by government or monarchal fiat or whim.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over riverboat casinos focuses for the most part on
competing economic claims. The benefits are there for all to see in
the form of jobs, tax revenues, civic contributions and economic
vitality in communities where casinos exist. The alleged
liabilities, though, are mere contentions, not substantially proven
and certainly not obvious. Experts of questionable credentials are
recruited to make the economic case against gambling, but their
claims are largely unconvincing.
</P>
<P>
   Such claims, however, whether pro and con, are beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   The only valid point is the fairness of what's being attempted.
It isn't fair, nor is it virtuous, to attempt the economic
destruction of a legally constituted industry doing business in
good faith.
</P>
<P>
   While it's not fashionable to defend gambling, standing up for
fairness should never go out of style.

FLOOD VICTIM'S FAMILY BLASTS KANSAS CITY'S RESPONSE

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The family of a Kansas City man swept to his
death as he waited for rescue on a Brush Creek bridge blasted the
city Thursday for its response to the Oct. 4 flash flood.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Louise Hudson also said she would not support a
half-cent sales tax proposed by Mayor Emanuel Cleaver because tens
of millions of dollars already spent on flood improvements weren't
enough to save the life of her son, Orlando Hudson, 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they should give them half of anything,'' she
said from her East Side home. ``What would they do with it this
time?''
</P>
<P>
   She and another son, Marvin Hudson, said they were incensed that
the city's flash flood warning system had been unplugged at the
Fire Department and that the city had no contingency plans for such
a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they knew this amount of rain was coming, backup plans
should have been put in place, like blocking off the Brush Creek
area and evacuations,'' Marvin Hudson said. ``It's hard to see a
big city like Kansas City acting like a bumbling country town.
People died, they lost their lives, because of this.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials confirmed Thursday that only four of 17 rainfall
and water level sensors scattered throughout the Brush Creek
watershed were operating the night of the flood.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaver said that the Hudsons' anger is understandable but
misplaced, and defended the city's response to the flooding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most disturbing part of this is the painful question
bereaved families will ask: `Would my loved one have been saved?'
'' Cleaver said. ``I agree (with other city officials that) we
probably wouldn't have saved any lives, but I don't agree that we
are out of the way of some public anger.''
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials this week acknowledged that the city has never
prepared contingency response plans for flash flooding on Brush
Creek, even though the 1977 flood killed 25 persons.
</P>
<P>
   /{The Kansas City Star/} reported this week that a high-tech
$275,000 system that was supposed to warn city officials of flash
flooding on Brush Creek had been unplugged from an electrical
outlet at the fire communications center.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Kansas City Fire Department's receiving equipment
was unplugged and not receiving data since Aug. 16, the data were
recorded by the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters said that the sensors detected nearly three times
the amount of rainfall necessary to trigger flash flooding at least
30 minutes before seven persons, including Orlando Hudson, died
near the Prospect Avenue bridge.
</P>
<P>
   City maintenance workers spent Thursday assessing the condition
of the creek's monitoring system, said Terry Leeds, a storm water
manager with the Water Services Department.
</P>
<P>
   Leeds said that none of the six water-level gauges worked. The
operating portion of the system consisted of four rain gauges, two
each in Johnson and Jackson counties. He had no explanation for why
the gauges were inoperable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (gauges) that give you the best advance warning are the
precipitation gauges,'' Leeds said.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Hudson said the community should focus its anger with
the city's response on Prospect Avenue and its low bridge over
Brush Creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should protest and get together and walk that bridge,''
Dorothy Hudson said. ``They should have fixed that bridge years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaver said that such improvements, and the ability to react
quickly to the next flood emergency, will be possible only if the
city raises the money to meet the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaver said he will meet with Gov. Mel Carnahan today to
discuss the possibility of a special legislative session early next
month to authorize a special flood relief tax election. The city
hopes to hold the election on Dec. 8.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by voters, a one-half cent sales tax would be
imposed for 18 months and raise about $45 million for flood control
and storm sewer improvement projects throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaver pointed to a proposed $250,000 expenditure in his sales
tax proposal for additional rescue equipment and training.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to ask themselves, what if the (flood warning
system) alarm had gone off?'' Cleaver said. ``We had no swift water
rescue equipment. Even if we could have responded, what would we
have responded with?''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaver acknowledged the city could have done a better job of
Brush Creek planning. He said the city had been lulled into a false
sense of security by the lack of serious damage along the waterway
during the floods of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you looked down Brush Creek (in 1993) I believed that
finally, we had solved this problem, and no one began planning for
this catastrophe,'' he said. ``We were not prepared, and this city
cannot afford to have its citizens in harm's way.''

TV WRITER, 32, PASSED FOR 19; BLOOM IS OFF HER CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ A 32-year-old woman who pretended to be a teen-ager
to get work faces the possible loss of a lucrative writing contract
with Touchstone Television.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Riley Weston, posed as a 19-year-old writer whose
skill at dealing with teen-age issues earned her a job on the new
WB show ``Felicity'' and a three-year, $300,000 contract with
Touchstone Television, a division of Walt Disney, to write shows
dealing with teen-agers. Ms. Weston, who looks far younger than 32,
was also placed on Entertainment Weekly's recent list of
Hollywood's most creative 100 people.
</P>
<P>
   But questions arose about Ms. Weston when the television show
``Entertainment Tonight'' began working on a program about the
teen-age phenomenon. By all accounts, the television show was
informed that it should examine her real age. Ms. Weston changed
her name legally several years ago from Kimberlee Kramer.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine Television, which produced ``Felicity'' with Touchstone,
said in a statement that Ms. Weston was hired as a staff writer
``based on her writing talent and the unique perspective we felt
her age and life experience would allow her to bring to her
creative role on the show.'' The statement said that the
revelations about Ms. Weston were ``a complete surprise.'' It
added, ``We trusted her as a colleague and are saddened by her
dishonesty.''
</P>
<P>
   One Imagine executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the company felt duped by Ms. Weston's behavior. He said the cast
and crew had a party on the set for her on Aug. 26, on what was
believed to be her 19th birthday. ``We had this big birthday _ it's
so insane,'' said the executive.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weston no longer works on ``Felicity,'' and two executives
close to the show said Disney was also trying to end its contract
with her. ``They definitely want out,'' said one executive. Ms.
Weston was co-writer of an episode of ``Felicity'' that was filmed
this week and she played a small role in it.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Ms. Weston said her contract had not been
renewed for the show before the age story broke. An Imagine
executive said that Ms. Weston had been informed several weeks ago
that her writing contract on the show would not be extended. The
executive said Ms. Weston's last script was largely rewritten, and
it was decided to drop her contract. ``She was very sweet, very
nice _ she just got desperate for a gig,'' the executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Defending herself, Ms. Weston said in a statement, ``It's been
an accepted practice for actresses to lie about their age,
especially in instances where they are always asked to play
younger. In my desperation to find work as an actress, I adopted an
age appropriate for my physical appearance, never imagining I would
one day become a writer, a decision based on the scarcity of
quality roles for actresses of my `screen age.' ''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Weston said she never wanted to lie about her age to advance
her career as a writer. ``I could not be one age in the acting
world and another in the writing world, so I chose to maintain the
ruse,'' she said. ``In a business fraught with age bias, I did what
I felt I had to do to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weston said she regretted ``deceiving my agents, attorneys
and colleagues in what has been a very painful experience.''
</P>
<P>
   One Imagine executive noted that in the ``Felicity'' show filmed
this week, Ms. Weston played a character with an unusual name. She
was called Story.

<P>
   They spent 40 years building a life that produced six children,
a thriving business and the security for what was to be a carefree
retirement. But David and Ann Lambert's plans crumbled when he
suffered a stroke five years ago that left him partly paralyzed and
unable to speak more than a few words.
</P>
<P>
   In time, the Lamberts, both 63, learned to adjust, thanks to
good medical care, family support _ and a few of the wide array of
new or updated health devices and gadgets for use in the home. A
$3,400 motorized stairway lift, for instance, ``was the best money
I ever spent,'' Mrs. Lambert said. The lift has restored a taste of
independence to Lambert, who as an entrepreneur founded Lambert
Glass Co. in Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as more people like the Lamberts _ especially graying
baby boomers and their elderly parents _ face medical catastrophes,
a growing and increasingly competitive business in home health care
devices is taking shape to serve them.
</P>
<P>
   This industry's growth is not surprising considering the rapidly
rising population of older Americans. The number of people over 85
has grown six times as fast as the overall population since 1960.
The Census Bureau projects that by 2000, the percentage of elderly
people in this age group will more than double, to 12 percent from
5.6 percent in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   There is thus a powerful need for items that ease discomfort,
increase mobility and generally provide a sense of control for
those struggling with the aches and ailments of aging. And with the
government encouraging home health care to save money on
institutional care, numerous companies are stepping into the fray.
They include such big public companies as Invacare and Sunrise
Medical Inc. as well as smaller, private manufacturers and dealers
such as Rice Home Medical, New Abilities Systems Inc. and Gould's
Discount Medical, a division of Mobilectrics Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demographics make it a growth area, and the shifting focus
of health care makes it a growth area,'' said James Walsh, a
spokesman for the VGM Group, a consortium of independent suppliers
of health care products. ``Health care is moving out of the
institution and into the home.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, companies that have the latest health aids and the
best marketing see a chance for substantial increases in profits in
a virtually recession-proof $3 billion industry.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Laumer, executive director of Rice Home Medical in
Willmar, Minn., about 100 miles west of St. Paul, has seen her
business more than double in the last decade. Now, she said, ``all
of those folks in institutions in the past can stay in their own
homes or in assisted living.''
</P>
<P>
   A device sold by Rice Home Medical, for example, enables some
cancer patients to administer chemotherapy to themselves at home or
even while on vacation. Curtis Johnson, a retired construction
worker, knew nothing about this device until he discovered 10
months ago that he needed one.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who is 71 and suffers from liver cancer, says his
ambulatory infusion pump has allowed him to receive treatment while
he fishes for ``anything that wants to bite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't stop me from doing anything,'' said Johnson, who
lives in Granite Falls, Minn. Now, he simply goes to the hospital
to get the pump needed to operate the device and deliver his
treatment instead of spending hours there receiving it. ``You're in
there 10 or 15 minutes and turn around and go home just like
nothing ever happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Other devices are less critical but hugely helpful in the home.
</P>
<P>
   People with limited dexterity can buy plastic finger loops that
fasten to keys to help turn keys in doors. An E-Z Reacher, a long
rod with a small suction cup attached to the end, enables people to
pick up objects like soup cans and juice bottles without having to
bend or stretch. Other items help people turn lights on and off,
pull up their socks, thread a needle or turn pages of a book.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a gadget that allows people to smoke without
gripping the cigarette, though it might be stretching matters to
call that a health aid. This and many other products are made or
distributed by a small Canadian company called Parsons ADL (for
``accessories for daily living'') Inc., which does a big part of
its business over the Internet (www.parsonsadl.com).
</P>
<P>
   Many other items are more high technology, reflecting the race
to modernize older products and to come out with new ones that
appeal to disabled people, who are living more active lives than
ever. Invacare, a leader in home medical equipment based in Elyria,
Ohio, recently introduced a product that converts air to pure
oxygen, eliminating the need for emphysema patients to have
canisters refilled by a dealer.
</P>
<P>
   New Abilities, of Palo Alto, Calif., even makes a dental
retainer that is actually a tongue-touch key pad that allows
quadriplegics to operate household appliances, use a computer and
maneuver a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Many older people manage to avoid serious ailments, of course,
and the bulk of baby boomers are still young and healthy. But in
coming years the sheer size of this group _ nearly 78 million
people _ is expected to create increased demand for eyeglasses,
skin care creams, medical equipment, vitamins and other goods.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, baby boomers' parents are well into old age, the time
when medical needs are greatest. And largely because of managed
care restrictions, people need home medical care longer as the
average hospital stay has declined _ to 6.2 days in 1996 from 7.1
in 1986, according to the American Hospital Association.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, said Ken Gould, who runs Gould Discount Medical
in Louisville, where the Lamberts bought their stairway lift, not
enough people know about such products. So, he has started to
advertise on television and has expanded his showroom to display
more items.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day there are new products coming out that are more and
more helpful,'' Gould said. ``There are a lot of people out there
laboring and not knowing what is available.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, consumers will not necessarily rush to buy some of
these items, but they clearly have more choices these days. And
manufacturers and retailers of all sizes are stepping up efforts to
increase consumer awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our advertising support has gone from six figures to well into
the seven-figure numbers in the last three years,'' said Louis
Slangen, senior vice president for sales and marketing at Invacare.
The company has also expanded into mass retail channels in the last
three years, so shoppers can now buy its Aurora brand products,
such as walkers and canes, at Wal-Mart and even supermarkets like
Winn Dixie.
</P>
<P>
   The additional availability ``creates a great awareness level
and, of course, it enlarges the market,'' Slangen said. ``I think
what is most important for the industry is that people feel
confident and comfortable in using the products.'' In the past, he
added, many items ``did not look very attractive, the ergonomics
was not very good, and many products you would need reconstruction
in the house in order for them to go through the doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Suppliers and analysts who follow the industry say that kind of
inefficiency will no longer do. The market is growing by about 7
percent a year and will continue to do so for several decades, said
Jeff Knightly, an analyst at CIBC Oppenheimer. So, even in this era
of enormous growth, he said, only the low-cost providers and the
most innovative and efficient companies will survive, in part
because of new Medicare restrictions on patient reimbursement and
the cutthroat bidding that goes on in managed care.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those threats to weaker competitors, the VGM Group, the
suppliers' consortium, has seen the industry growth firsthand and
says its members have prospered as demand has picked up. The group
had 11 members when it was created in 1986 as a way for smaller
dealers to pool their resources to give them increased buying power
and a louder lobbying voice. It has since grown to about 1,300
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Stubbs is grateful that so many more companies are focusing
on this market. Her 84-year-old mother, Muriel Abramson, who
suffers from a cardiac condition, lives with Mrs. Stubbs and her
husband in San Antonio and depends on the latest in lightweight
wheelchairs and other devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would be in a nursing home if some of these things were
not available,'' Mrs. Stubbs said. For such people, she said,
functioning in a home without the aids ``would be extremely
difficult if not impossible, because there is no way you can be
with them every single second.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Stubbs, who is 46 and considers herself a typical baby
boomer, added that an increasing number of her friends and
relatives are caring for elderly relatives and have begun to think
about their own futures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about when we age,'' Mrs. Stubbs said, ``and what's
going to happen and where we are going to go and how we are going
to function.''

DOWN AND DIRTY IN THE IVORY TOWER

 (ATTN: Va.)   (bl)

<P>
   The financial stakes cannot compare with Monopoly. There is no
chance for global domination as in Risk. It may feel like a
life-or-death matter, but there's almost never a murder, as in
Clue.
</P>
<P>
   It's just academia, after all. But for those who think
university politics revolve around an elaborate sense of
gamesmanship all their own, there is now Survival of the Witless, a
combination board game and academic sendup based on the premise
that ``Knowledge is Nothing. Tenure is Everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Produced by a former history teacher who now works for Avalanche
Press, a small Virginia-based company best known for making war
games, Survival of the Witless has a simple goal _ gaining tenure.
It is described as ``the key to fame, wealth, happiness and most
importantly to never having to put in a single day's work again.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the goal is simple, the rules are convoluted enough that
the game probably works best as niche marketing _ more fun for
those with tenure or aspiring to it than to the average fan of
Trivial Pursuit or Parcheesi.
</P>
<P>
   Survival of the Witless was created by a former college history
professor who labored at a large Southern university but never
managed to get a job in which he could aim for tenure. He says he
wants to remain anonymous in case he decides to try again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Academia lends itself to game form, because there's a defined
goal, getting tenure, and it's important to get it before your
enemies,'' the game's creator said. ``It's highly competitive, and
its highly structured. It's played on two tracks, gaining status
and completing your book, so the game is played the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the game, as in academia itself, is currying favor
with enough professors to gain tenure. In this case, players need
to finish a book and get the vote of three of five members of the
faculty-review committee, whose tolerance for or aversion to
various behaviors vary with their politics, gender, race and sexual
orientation. They include such characters as R. Jackson Wentworth,
who has not taught a course since Herbert Hoover was president;
Lana Wong, who is facing multiple sexual harassment suits, and
Ricard Bergamo, known as One Book Willy, who has spent a career
recycling his one semi-famous book.
</P>
<P>
   Players draw cards toward publishing a book and pleasing
committee members, who reflect the game's scabrous view of academic
life. Most of the jockeying reflects a zero-sum game, where one
person's good fortune is usually at the expense of his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Good teaching is the equivalent of landing on someone else's
hotel on Boardwalk in Monopoly. The ``Student Support'' card,
gained when students clamor for a player to teach more courses,
means the player loses a status point with all faculty members.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a ``Student Boycott'' card, reflecting
teaching so dreadful that students refuse to register for classes,
means the lucky scholar has more time to divert from worthless
teaching to valuable writing. Players who draw the ``Student
Boycott'' card get to take writing cards from two other players,
who presumably are stuck in the classroom instead of at the word
processor.
</P>
<P>
   Valuable cards include being published in the New York Review of
Each Other's Books, getting a cherished research grant or having
your course load reduced. The most frequently used desirable card
is represented by a kiss planted on the rear end of a donkey,
apparently the surest road to success in the game.
</P>
<P>
   A ``Graduate Assistant'' card, denoting someone to do your work,
is good. A ``Would You Like Fries With That?'' card, indicating
that the graduate student has left to enter a work force that has
no use for his academic skills, is bad.
</P>
<P>
   A ``Bold New Theory'' card is good. A ``Theory Debunked'' card,
which can be played by another player proving your theory is not
bold, new or correct, is bad.
</P>
<P>
   Other recurring issues include a gossip card (powerful, but
perilous), a seduction card (see gossip) and other variations on
inappropriate gender-related behavior, like the ``Eye Rape'' card
in which you lose a point with all faculty members for looking at
an attractive student.
</P>
<P>
   The game's creator concedes that if the game has a bitter tinge,
it reflects his own unhappy experience in university politics.
Still, the game does seem to have some broader appeal. Thanks in
part to a story in the Chronicle of Higher Education, most of the
3,000 games originally produced have been sold, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me wrong,'' said the game's creator, who said his
own taste in games ran to poker and German board games. ``I take
higher education seriously. It's an honor and a privilege to be
allowed to teach college kids, and it angers me that there are
people who view it as a sinecure and a guaranteed paycheck for no
work. So the game reflects that. It's why the teaching award is the
nastiest card in the deck. It's what cost me my job. I got a
teaching award, and it was over. It truly was.''
</P>
<P>
   His one nugget of strategic advice?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is your enemy,'' he said.

 &HT;    Agents arrest Texas militiamen
 &HT;    By Cara Tanamachi
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The crackle of a loudspeaker broke the still
morning air as dawn seeped through the trees into the crowded
campgroundsat Colorado Bend State Park early on July 4, 1997.
``This is the FBI. Mr. Glover. Mr. Dorsett. We have warrants for
your arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   Two dozen agents, armed and decked out in paramilitary gear,
watched as militiamen Bradley Playford Glover and Michael Leonard
Dorsett emerged from their tents, hands in the air. In seconds,
agents had the men in handcuffs and on their way to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Glover and Dorsett had taken different routes into the militia
movement, but they were united that morning in the belief that
Chinese troops were training at Fort Hood, 100 miles to the east,
FBI agents say. Glover, a retired Navy intelligence specialist from
Kansas, and Dorsett, a roofing contractor from Fort Worth, also
feared an invasion by U.N. troops.
</P>
<P>
   The men had planned a pre-emptive strike with guns and pipe
bombs on Fort Hood later that day, according to information from a
yearlong undercover investigation by Missouri State Police.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say Glover and Dorsett are extremists on the fringe
of a militia movement that has given rise to dozens of domestic
terrorism plots since the 1995 bombing of the federal building in
Oklahoma City in April 1995. FBI and police have thwarted plots to
assassinate judges, poison water supplies and even blow up the
FBI's national fingerprint identification center.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, Congress has allocated more than $370 million to FBI
counterterrorism programs. Local and federal officers have beefed
up surveillance of some extremist groups of the so-called patriot
movement, made up of people who generally believe the government
has subverted citizens' rights. Many militia members point to gun
control laws or ballooning tax rates as evidence the government has
overstepped its bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Glover and Dorsett eventually pleaded guilty to weapons charges
and await sentencing next month in federal court in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The morning of their arrest, agents found a loaded handgun under
Glover's pillow and more arms in his white Ford pickup, including
four other pistols, two rifles, a silencer, 1,600 rounds of
ammunition, fatigues, riot gas and a militia handbook.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, eight other people in several other states were
arrested in connection with the plot against Fort Hood.
</P>
<P>
   Glover's attorney says that his client had no intention of
bombing or attacking Fort Hood, that he only wanted to see for
himself whether foreign troops were stationed there.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officers and groups that monitor extremist
militia organizations, however, say that Glover and Dorsett posed a
serious threat and represent the more dangerous segments of the
patriot movement.
</P>
<P>
   Investigations tricky
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say the beginnings of a plot to bomb Fort Hood
emerged in 1996, during a meeting in Kansas City, Mo., of the Third
Continental Congress, a gathering of 30 representatives of militia
groups from across the country.
</P>
<P>
   At that three-day meeting, in a bare room at a Holiday Inn early
in November 1996, the group of mostly white men discussed their
hopes for a new government, one that would in their minds better
protect the rights laid out in the Constitution. Among them,
quietly listening, were two undercover Missouri State Police
officers, including Sgt. Greg Hug.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, where pro-gun and militia groups have long been
active, state police have been aggressively investigating
suspicious members since 1992. ``Here in Missouri, we take these
groups seriously,'' Hug said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigating militias is a tricky business. The vast majority
of members, said Hug, are people who do not intend to break the
law. And law enforcement must walk a thin line between sniffing out
extremists bent on violence and preserving individual rights. Hug
said while most people at the meeting talked of parlimentary
procedure and constitutional law, one man, Ronald Griesacker, spoke
about forcibly overthrowing the government.
</P>
<P>
   He inspired two couples to join him in breaking from the main
group. Authorities have said Griesacker is a con man who used
rhetoric to persuade militia members to give him money and shelter.
He and the couples toured the United States, trying to recruit
followers.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, they ended up meeting and training at Glover's home
in Towanda, Kan. Glover was then a prominent member of the Kansas
Militia.
</P>
<P>
   Griesacker was later ousted from the group when Glover and
others became convinced he was a man of words and not of action,
Hug said.
</P>
<P>
   Glover, 58, stepped in as an informal leader for the group. A
retired Navy intelligence operative, he owned a computer consulting
firm in Towanda.
</P>
<P>
   Glover is divorced with two sons, one a West Point graduate and
Army captain, the other a graduate student in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Some who know Glover say he is an intelligent man who in recent
years became increasingly convinced of elaborate conspiracies
within the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether valid or not, in his mind there are political threats
to the stability of this country,'' said Frank Jackson, a Dallas
attorney who is representing Glover. Through his attorney, Glover
declined to be interviewed for this article.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley is a remarkable, bright, articulate person,'' Jackson
added. ``He didn't drop out of the sixth grade. He isn't some kind
of nut that crawled out of the woodwork.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Glover became active in the Kansas Militia,
doing media interviews predicting the downfall of the government,
which he believed had been infiltrated by foreign agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realize one thing,'' he told the Kansas City Star in 1994.
``We're not turning against the government, the true approved
Constitution of the United States. We're turning against a rogue
element, a cancer against the body. And we're going to cut that
cancer out and restore the health of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Hug said Glover suffered from what he called a ``Red Dawn''
syndrome, after the movie of the same name, whose main character
leads an underground resistance against communists who have taken
over the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They watched 'Red Dawn' constantly, and this got them fired
up,'' Hug said. ``They believed they were going to be precipitators
of the great guerilla war.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorsett, 43, believed the system had failed him, say those who
know him. Dorsett's attorney declined to comment for this article
and advised Dorsett not to speak until after his sentencing
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Dorsett found himself divorced twice and in
tax trouble, with the IRS claiming he and his business, Texas
Roofing Unlimited, owed almost $7,000 in taxes, according to court
records.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Pitcavage, a militia historian and consultant to law
enforcement agencies across the country, said some militia members
are drawn to the idea of conspiracies to explain troubles in their
own lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people join these groups because they can't quite cope
financially with the capitalist world,'' Pitcavage said. ``They
lose their jobs, they have mortgage problems, tax problems, divorce
problems _ they just can't cut it. And human nature being what it
is, they externalize the blame. They believe this was done to them
by someone, most often the government, and that makes them angry
and desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   In Glover's group, members believed strongly in a malicious
force behind the United Nations. Many patriots share the fear that
some disaster, spawned by a foreign invasion or an internal
government conspiracy, will lead to the declaration of martial law,
depriving U.S. citizens of their constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing themselves as freedom fighters, Glover, Dorsett and two
Midwest couples, along with several others, plotted to attack
foreign troops at American army bases, including Fort Hood and an
Air Force base in New Mexico, Hug said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In June 1997, we got a call from Glover, asking us to join him
to attack Red Chinese troops at Fort Hood,'' Hug said. ``Myself and
my partner tried to talk him out of it. But he was insistent. They
started amassing a lot of ammunition and automatic weapons. They
said they were going hunting at the base on July 4. We knew they
were serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Glover and Dorsett had picked the Fourth of July because the
base would be open and filled with families celebrating the
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Glover and other members soon sold their homes, businesses and
belonging so they could be mobile and have ready cash, Hug said.
Two members of the group went to Creede, Colo. to set up a safe
housein the remote mountain village, where Glover and Dorsett were
to hide after their mission.
</P>
<P>
   Hug and his partner notified the FBI, which began trailing
Glover and Dorsett in Arlington, where they lived a short time. On
July 3, FBI agents saw them load their pickup with guns and other
equipment, including fatigues and bulletproof vests.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Holmes, an FBI agent who was part of the team that would
take Glover and Dorsett into custody, said agents worried about a
host of possible complications. The campground was crowded. Agents
feared Glover and Dorsett might have planted booby traps.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was considered a high-risk arrest because you have
explosives, you have weapons and you have individuals that pretty
much are considered armed and dangerous,'' Holmes said. ``That we
took them into custody without a single shot fired _ this was good
day in law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Some militia members, however, say that Glover and Dorsett's
arrest is just another example of overzealous officers unfairly
targeting militias.
</P>
<P>
   Militia advocate Ed Wolfe of Oregon, who maintains a Web site
called Caged Patriots at www.involved.com/ewolfe/caged/ which
documents alleged mistaken arrests of militia members, says the
idea of two men plotting to attack the nation's largest army bases
``ludicrous.'' Wolfe said officers are overly suspicious of militia
members because they own guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patriots are people who love the government and the
Constitution, perhaps more than officers do, but they are also the
ones who will point out when the government has overstepped its
bounds,'' Wolfe said. ``The government sees us as a threat. That's
why today if you work to organize a militia, you might as well
paint a target on the back of your head.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents and Texas state troopers say they do not investigate
groups simply because of their beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only become involved when someone engages in an illegal
act,'' Holmes said. ``Until and unless they do, we do not become
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   New laws have strengthened anti-terrorism efforts, including the
1996 Effective Death Penalty and Public Safety Act, which added the
death penalty to the range of punishment for bombings and other
acts of domestic terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union, among other constitutional
rights groups, has criticized much of the anti-terrorism
legislation, saying that it broadens the investigative powers of
the FBI and threatens individual rights. They say, for example, the
1996 act includes an overly broad definition of terrorism that
could lead to improper labeling of some political groups as
terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   Membership in many militia groups seems to be shrinking,
according to the Anti-Defamation League, which tracks extremist and
hate groups. But ADL officials say they suspect more groups are
going underground, making membership numbers harder to gauge. Wolfe
said people fear retaliation from the government, which is why some
groups are not as vocal as they once were.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jackson said Glover is stoic about what likely will
be a five-year prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tells me that he was trained in his intelligence work how
to be a prisoner of war, and that's how he'll approach his
incarceration, for better or worse.''

DIMAGGIO IN HOSPITAL WITH PNEUMONIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (pr)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe DiMaggio is being treated for pneumonia in a hospital near
his home in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame center fielder, who will turn 84 next month,
has been a patient in the Hollywood Memorial Hospital near Miami
since Oct. 5 and was expected to be released next week, perhaps as
early as Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had pneumonia for three months,'' his lawyer and
confidant, Morris Engelberg, said Friday. ``He walked around with
it for a couple of months. He couldn't knock it out. But he should
be out this coming Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio, who has been using a heart regulator for several
years, has suffered from pneumonia in the past. Engelberg said that
fluid had been drained from DiMaggio's lungs this week and that
DiMaggio would not be able to attend the opening game of the World
Series at Yankee Stadium on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't fly on pneumonia,'' Engelberg said, ``so he's got to
stop flying for two or three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio has appeared at Yankee Stadium in recent years to throw
out the ceremonial first ball. The commissioner's office has
announced that the first pitch will be thrown by Sammy Sosa of the
Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio appeared at Yankee Stadium on the final day of the
season two weeks ago on Joe DiMaggio Day. He received a gift from
George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner: duplicates of
the eight diamond-studded World Series rings that were stolen from
DiMaggio in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio played 13 seasons with the Yankees, starting in 1936
and ending in 1951, with three seasons missed when he served in the
Army Air Force during World War II. He played in 11 All-Star Games
and 10 World Series, and in 1941 DiMaggio set a major league record
by hitting in 56 consecutive games. In 1969, the centennial year of
baseball, he was voted the sport's greatest living player. &QL;

IS GLAM'S RETURN REAL OR FANTASY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID HANDELMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gabe Doppelt was scrambling. As VH-1's creative director of
fashion, Ms. Doppelt is a producer of the cable music channel's
annual Fashion Awards, and each year she commissions designers to
create outfits around a rock-related theme for the show's opening.
But she admits, ``Every year I look for the appropriate collision
of fashion and music, and I never really find it.''
</P>
<P>
   This year promised to be no different, until Ms. Doppelt heard
that a movie about the glam rock movement had won an award at the
Cannes Film Festival, and her antennae began buzzing.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Haynes' ``Velvet Goldmine'' is a fictionalized re-creation
of the early 1970s British rock scene, when, in reaction to frumpy
hippiedom, T. Rex's lead singer, Marc Bolan, started wearing
glitter and women's clothes, and former folkie David Bowie decked
himself out as the sexually ambiguous spaceman Ziggy Stardust. For
a brief, shining moment, men wore eye shadow, feather boas,
platform shoes and the tightest outfits the era's fabrics allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Doppelt, who as a teen-ager in England had once worn a
Bolan-inspired leopard-print catsuit, called Miramax, the
distributor of ``Velvet Goldmine,'' to screen the movie. Seeing the
eye-catching period costumes designed by Sandy Powell, she knew
she'd found her motif. She sent ``Velvet Goldmine'' stills and
vintage '70s videos to designers she thought would respond,
including Tom Ford, Michael Kors, John Galliano and Anna Sui.
</P>
<P>
   They not only delivered fanciful concoctions to VH-1, which will
telecast its awards show Oct. 27, but some of them also carried the
theme into their own work.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sui got so excited that when she sat down to design her
spring 1999 collection (which will be presented Nov. 4), she
plastered her studio walls with images of the film's co-stars, Ewan
MacGregor and Jonathan Rhys Meyers (who play fictionalized versions
of Iggy Pop and Bowie), while blasting songs like T. Rex's ``20th
Century Boy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie captured that whole excitement when there's
something going on, rules to be broken,'' Ms. Sui said. ``That
hasn't happened for the longest time.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as myriad glam influences seem to be percolating back into
pop culture in music, theater and fashion, the question arises
whether this trend is the expression of an authentic, grass-roots
revival _ or a fabrication of the buzz machine.
</P>
<P>
   On the cover of its latest issue, W magazine announces an
article about ``Velvet Goldmine'' with the proclamation ``The
Return of Glam.'' Vogue's latest issue makes the bold, if
ambiguous, claim, ``If `Velvet Goldmine' doesn't turn out to be the
IT movie of 1998, it will be odd.''
</P>
<P>
   The hunger for something new is so strong that when Ford
introduced some flower prints, beads, ruffles and tight leather
jackets at Gucci's Milan show two weeks ago, Women's Wear Daily
proclaimed ``Glam Slam!'' on its cover, and added, ``The fashion
movement everyone has been waiting for finally exploded.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it real or is it spandex? Is glam due to be the next big
moment on the streets and over the airwaves, or is it a flash in
the pan, a media-propelled bandwagon set in motion by a movie
distributor?
</P>
<P>
   Surely, more must be required to start a worldwide style
sensation than one nostalgic cable television producer's screening
an art-house movie about a short-lived subculture. But perhaps not
that much more. The pop-culture recycling machine has already
disinterred the goofier looks of the '70s; why not the most
ultra-fabulous one?
</P>
<P>
   Most filmmakers would kill to make the kind of waves ``Velvet
Goldmine'' has made even before it opens (it comes to theaters Nov.
6), and Miramax is exploiting the ``return of glam'' angle for all
it's worth.
</P>
<P>
   But the makers of the movie _ which is, after all, an art-house
fantasia with a bisexual leading character, not ``Saturday Night
Fever'' _ seem somewhat baffled by the brewing phenomenon. Informed
of W's cover proclamation, Ms. Powell, who was previously nominated
for Academy Awards for the costumes for ``Wings of the Dove,''
started laughing. ``Gosh, really?'' she said. ``To me, it doesn't
feel like it. People are used to wearing more comfortable
clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Platforms for men? ``I don't think it's gonna happen,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the movie's executive producers is Michael Stipe, the
lead singer for R.E.M., who has worn dresses onstage. He
understands glam's appeal. ``Clothes haven't been fun for a
while,'' he said. ``Especially right now. You walk into the stores,
and everything is very flat and very gray. And glam is a nice
respite from that kind of accepted dullness.''
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't think ``Velvet Goldmine'' is going to do for
spangles what ``American Graffiti'' did for white T-shirts. ``I
don't think the glam equivalent of poodle skirts is going to be the
look, or should be,'' Stipe said. ``It would be silly and
redundant.''
</P>
<P>
   Before too much sanctimony sets in about a hype-driven return of
glam, it is fitting to recall that the original movement was
self-conscious and artificial to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all about role-playing, artifice and escapism,'' said
Craig Wedren, the lead singer of Shudder to Think, who wrote and
performed two Bowie-like songs for the soundtrack of ``Velvet
Goldmine.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar view inspired Haynes, the writer and director of
``Velvet Goldmine,'' which implies that Bowie concocted the whole
glam movement as a marketing ploy. ``Rock has always been so much
about `authenticity,' and consecutive generations are always
dueling about who's more `real''' Haynes said. ``But ultimately
rock is a mass-media enterprise, funneled through modes of
production, and I don't know what stays absolutely `real' in that
process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Glam artists were already several steps ahead of that by
acknowledging the fake-ness from the start _ celebrating it,
enjoying it and being ironic about it as well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Velvet Goldmine'' crudely echoes the structure of ``Citizen
Kane,'' as a reporter (Christian Bale) reconstructs, through
interviews and flashbacks, the story of Brian Slade, a bisexual,
Bowie-esque figure played by Rhys Meyers. Much of the story hews
closely to events in Bowie's life, including the early influence of
Angie Bowie, his wife at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Other aspects are more impressionistic _ the Ewan McGregor
character is part Lou Reed, part Iggy Pop, and looks a lot like
Kurt Cobain.
</P>
<P>
   The original glam scene was born, Barney Hoskyns says in his new
book, ``Glam! Bowie, Bolan and the Glitter Rock Revolution''
(Pocket Books), at a show Bowie did in London in February 1970. He
wore a glittery ``Rainbowman'' costume and blue hair. The audience
mostly booed him off the stage (a moment recreated in ``Velvet
Goldmine''), but Bolan was watching from the sidelines, and
absorbed the influence.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bowie assembled a look and sound that drew on myriad sources:
his experience in an avantgarde mime troupe, Andy Warhol's
superstar-obsessed Factory, Weimer-era German cabaret and Stanley
Kubrick's ``Clockwork Orange.'' The glam torch was also picked up
by Brian Eno and Bryan Ferry of Roxy Music and, in the United
States, by the New York Dolls.
</P>
<P>
   Musically, glam has never really gone away; it just mutated.
There have been strains of it in everything from Elton John to
early MTV stars like Adam Ant and Duran Duran; in the heavy metal
``hair bands'' of the '80s, and in the recent bevy of
doomed-romantic English bands like Pulp, Suede and Blur.
</P>
<P>
   But as an influence on wardrobes and attitudes, glam has long
since been supplanted by punk, grunge and, most recently, late-'70s
disco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny thing is,'' Haynes said, ``glam never had that much
power in the United States to begin with, so there's very few
people I know here who feel they went through it the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Haynes himself, 37, although a fan of the music in his
youth, came to it too late to dress the part. When writing the
screenplay, he dyed his hair red and wore tight, midriff-baring
clothes and platform shoes.
</P>
<P>
   By the time filming began, he abandoned the look. ``There's so
much upkeep,'' he said. ``Major high-maintenance hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Given all that, it seems improbable that glam styles would
return now. Nonetheless, there have been rumblings of a reawakening
quite separate from ``Velvet Goldmine.'' The past year has seen the
successes of the Off Broadway glam musical ``Hedwig and the Angry
Inch'' and Eddie Izzard, the comedian who wears makeup and dresses.
( Haynes cast him as the Bowie character's manager in ``Velvet
Goldmine.'')
</P>
<P>
   More surprising still has been the return of Kiss, the heavily
made-up rock band. And most tellingly, rock's reigning image
manipulator, Marilyn Manson, recently made himself over from Goth
to glam, complete with Bowie-inspired red hair and spaceman
wardrobe. He even released a cover of Bowie's ``Golden Years.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventh Avenue's embrace of glam comes, as usual, with a mixture
of inspiration and exploitation. Before and after his Milan show,
Ford of Gucci cited a range of glam-like influences _ Las Vegas,
biker girls, Cher _ without specifically naming glam rock.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sui, who has shown traces of glam for years, in nearly every
collection, is making allowances this time for the fuller bodies of
aging boomer customers, who find themselves no longer as twig-thin
as when they first embraced glam rock. ``You have the benefit of
technology _ Lycra is stretchy,'' she said. ``It won't fall apart
after you wear it a couple of times.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Ms. Doppelt of VH-1 doesn't envision the trend,
which she helped to fan, taking hold in the malls of America. ``I
don't think it's for everybody,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As a cultural revolution, it's been rendered completely empty in
her view. ``I never look for deep meanings in anything when it
comes to fashion and music,'' she said. ``It's just kids dressing
up. And I don't think kids will get into glam _ the
extra-wide-pants movement is much stronger than glam rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Norma Kamali, who sold half of her women's clothes in the early
'70s to men, recalls the era as ``a time when no one had
inhibitions about anything, and it was very creative as a result.''
In the current fashion climate, she added, ``if somebody does
express themselves individually, they almost look like they need to
be medicated or institutionalized.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the men who used to wear Kamali is David Johansen,
formerly of the New York Dolls. ``We were just trying to be
anti-denim, to put a little pizazz back into it,'' Johansen
recalled. ``It's an old tradition. It goes back to, like, Mozart
and Little Richard. Every generation is going to want to do it _
for certain artistic people, it's part of the process of
exploration.''
</P>
<P>
   Johansen, 48, now wears dinner jackets and croons Spanish music
in the persona of an alter ego, Buster Poindexter. ``To today's
scene, I'm like Peter Sellers in `I Love You, Alice B. Toklas,'''
he said, referring to the uptight, aging lawyer who tries to be a
hippie in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one verity about a flirtation with glam _ either by
an individual or an entire culture _ it is that the style is so
extreme that any embrace of it will quickly pass, like other
youthful indulgences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I look at Kiss,'' Johansen said, ``and think, `There
but for the grace of God go I.' ''

BUDGET DEAL PUTS CLINTON ON THE REBOUND, AT LEAST FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (adds sentence to end of 4th graf)  (Political Column; with CONGRESS-SPEND, CONGRESS-PORN) 
(bl) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here's a quiz to see if you are keeping up with the
head-snapping political swerves in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Was the following said by a congressman in a) praise or b)
condemnation of President Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   ``Now let me tell you, often in our lives, in our personal
lives, we have choices: Do you want instant gratification, or do
you want to do the responsible thing for yourself and your family
and others, for the future?''
</P>
<P>
   If you answered b), you are hopelessly mired in the past of, oh,
two or three days ago, when folks were still talking about a
scandal involving a certain former intern. Hard to remember back
that far, actually.
</P>
<P>
   The words were said by House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt _ who
has been a sharp critic of Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky
controversy _ to laud the president's rejection of Republican
tax-cut proposals. Gephardt, with other Democrats, had crowded
around Clinton in the Rose Garden on Friday morning to drench him
with praise, like jubilant football players with a tank of
Gatorade.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it was the Republicans who were left Friday to grouse
about their party's standard-bearers. The cause of all this
celebration and consternation, of course, was the budget deal,
which many conservatives declared won on the president's terms.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, backed up by dozens of Democrats, Clinton basked
in the bright sunshine and gave his most rousing campaign speech of
the political year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight days of progress cannot totally erase eight months of
partisanship,'' he said. ``We all know that in those eight months
of partisanship, too many dreams of too many families were
deferred.''
</P>
<P>
   What Clinton on Friday called ``a dizzying week'' in Washington
left some experienced political hands stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this hubbub about a $500 billion bill and `My God, we
saved the environment for you, we saved Social Security,''' said
former Rep. John Anderson, R-Ill., who ran for president as an
independent in 1980, after watching Clinton on television. ``I just
sat there, scratching my head. Here's a guy who was on the canvas,
and he's acting like he's just starting to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Greenstein, a historian and expert on the presidency at
Princeton University, said Clinton had reason for confidence,
having done better than anyone could have expected since Aug. 17,
when he acknowledged an affair with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   He said Clinton had rallied once-panicked Democrats behind him
by playing the budget game skillfully and maintaining his high
public approval ratings. The reversal of political fortune, he
said, was ``full of anomalies and paradoxes _ like who would
imagine a president would be strengthened by being the third person
to have impeachment hearings?''
</P>
<P>
   But, Greenstein said, the president ``seems to have to be in
some extremely adverse situation to really use his formidable
political talents to good effect.''
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton ``gets any weaker,'' wrote political columnist Paul
A. Gigot in Friday's Wall Street Journal, ``Republicans may pass
Hillary's health-care plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Stomach-churning reversals have been a constant of Clinton's
political career. A breakdown in the Mideast peace talks or another
drop in the stock market could make him appear weak again, and the
impeachment inquiry will grind on. For all the Democrats' new-found
bravado, they are unlikely to break the historic pattern of losses
by presidential parties in midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Republicans probably are going to get their act
together enough in the remaining two weeks of the campaign to hang
on,'' said Anderson, a visiting professor at Nova Southeastern
University Law School who analyzed congressional races this year
for the Center for Voting and Democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Clinton appealed urgently to Democrats to go to the
polls, to counteract what is expected to be a larger Republican
turnout. ``Staying home is not a very good option when so much is
riding on a trip to the ballot box,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the cold political reality he faces, Clinton flew
to Chicago on Friday afternoon to appear with Sen. Carol
Moseley-Braun, D-Ill., and raise $500,000 for Senate Democrats.
Moseley-Braun trails her opponent, who is far better financed, by
as much as 12 points in recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that ``elections are always about tomorrow,'' Clinton
declared that he had a ``different view of a lot of things than
some people'' who live in Washington. ``I tend to evaluate people
based on what they do that affects the lives of people back home,''
he said, as demonstrators protested against him outside.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton rattled off a list of issues that Democrats should run
on, including fixing the Social Security system, rebuilding schools
and raising the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, some aides allowed themselves a bit of
satisfaction at seeing opponents flummoxed, even if briefly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think after the last six years of making the mistake
of counting him out and predicting demise, those who have made a
career out of doing that would take a deep breath,'' said Rahm
Emanuel, a senior adviser who is leaving Clinton's service next
week after seven years.
</P>
<P>
   But Emanuel added that he had developed a maxim during his years
of evaluating instant political reviews. ``You're never as good as
they say you are,'' he said, ``and you're never as bad as they say
you are.''

AFTER BUDGET DEAL, IT'S TIME TO WRITE THE BILL

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some conservatives sounded notes of discord Friday
over the federal spending agreement, but they also said they would
probably vote for the $500 billion package because it boosted
defense spending and provided aid to farmers.
</P>
<P>
   However, no one can vote on the package just yet, because it is
not finished.
</P>
<P>
   The deal that President Clinton and Republican leaders hailed
Thursday was a broad outline of areas of agreement on the final
portion of the $1.7 trillion budget, not a written document. That
is now being crafted by the chairmen of the spending committees and
their aides, who said Friday that there were still disputes that
needed to be resolved and that the final document could run to more
than 3,000 pages.
</P>
<P>
   For example, still unresolved is a dispute over whether airlines
can create a ``peanut-free'' zone to protect passengers who are
allergic to peanuts. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other members
from Georgia, a major peanut-producing state, are fighting the
proposal, which would force airlines to ban peanuts within three
rows of someone with an allergy.
</P>
<P>
   Congress gave itself until midnight Tuesday to vote on the final
bill, agreeing with President Clinton to a fifth extension of
temporary financing to keep the government open. The budget was due
Oct. 1, the start of the new fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was initially expected Friday, but the bill is nowhere
near to being written.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of top-level bargainers _ including Gingrich,
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and White House chief of staff
Erskine Bowles _ were in the room for the final deal. Excluded were
the committee chairmen and the heads of the appropriation
committees, who now must write the language that will put the deal
into law.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone on Capitol Hill expects the budget to pass
eventually, with the biggest defections coming from conservatives
who object to the $20 billion taken from the surplus to address
so-called emergencies and for the package's failure to offer voters
a serious tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   The lag time before the bill is officially closed is making some
conservatives nervous that more members will try to add provisions
that will further expand a bill they already consider overly
bloated. And some worry that once the hometown pork that is stuffed
into the bill is publicly revealed, voters could put pressure on
members not to support it. The elections are Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   But several conservatives said that despite these problems, they
expected to support the bill anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., said: `Most of my friends, who are
predominantly activist conservatives, are split about 50-50. If tax
cuts were your primary thing, then you're unhappy, but many
conservatives have a mixed agenda. My position is, hold the nose
and vote yes. We have no tax cuts and far too much spending that I
oppose, but that's the nature of compromise. Every member has a
little different focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Souder said he liked the extra money for defense spending, and
he liked the price supports for farmers. Hog farmers in his
district, whose biggest customers were Japan and China, had been
hit hard by the collapse of Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans said that the bill seemed skewed in favor of
the Democrats. They cited two reasons: Clinton needed to curry
favor with Democrats to shore up support if the House votes to
impeach him, and Republican leaders feared that if they had stood
up to Clinton, they might have forced a government shutdown and
Republicans would be blamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton was buying votes,'' said Rep. David Hobson, R-Ohio.
``He was sucking up to the liberal Democrats so they would support
him in impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin, R-La., said the leaders seemed
motivated by a desire to avoid the political damage they incurred
from the partial government shutdowns of 1995 and 1996. He also
cited the president's need to placate the left by adding costly
domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of the lessons learned three years ago and the
scandal on the president's side yielded the inevitable result, a
budget that leans way to the left,'' Tauzin said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said he would probably support the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be enthusiastically,'' he said. ``It won't be holding
my nose either. I would have preferred to spend more of this money
on a tax cut. I think we would have gotten a tax cut, but for the
scandal. If the president had not been caught up with the scandal,
he probably would have followed the Dick Morris strategy and moved
towards the center.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said he recognized that some conservatives were wary of
the agreement. But he sought to reassure them that the package
served their interests.
</P>
<P>
   He cited a $9 billion increase in defense spending. And he noted
that the Republicans had blocked several items, including
needle-exchange programs in the District of Columbia, national
education testing and U.S. contributions to a United Nations
program that pays for family planning in China, which many in
Congress object to because China has a policy of coercing abortions
and forcing sterilization.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said the agreement was the best that could be achieved
``when you have a conservative Republican Congress and a liberal
Democratic president.''
</P>
<P>
   Some conservatives who had been especially critical were more
understanding Thursday. Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., a leader of
conservatives in the House, had denounced the bill earlier as a
Great Society type of big-spending program. Friday, after a meeting
of Republicans, he said, ``Our leadership found themselves in a bad
situation and did a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   A few remained outright hostile to the bill, as much for the
hasty way in which it was cobbled together as for what it
contained.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, said: `I'm voting `no' unless
something revolutionary happens between now and Tuesday. I think
it's the process that gives the president the ability to stonewall
until the very end and then hold us for ransom. The Republican
leadership in the House and Senate did a good job of limiting the
highway robbery, but it's still gone too far beyond the spending
caps.''
</P>
<P>
   Also angry at the rushed endgame was Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Miss.,
who took to the House floor and said he could not support the final
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to urge my colleagues to vote `no,' '' Taylor said.
``We have stayed here this long. We can stay a little bit longer.
And I am going to encourage my colleagues to continue to vote no
until we are given adequate time to study the measure that is
brought before us.''

   FEATURE STORY
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN-THEATER (Undated) _ Like book publishing before it _
until the last decade, a quaint holdout against the forces of media
consolidation _ the theater is now becoming ``content'' suitable
for synergistic annexation and exploitation by our new
entertainment conglomerates. By Frank Rich.
</P>
<P>
   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   BELOVED-FILM (Undated) _ What is most impressive about the film
version of ``Beloved'' is not that it simplifies Toni Morrison's
difficult esthetic to attract a wider audience and become a
blockbuster in the process, but that it takes an opposite tack: It
stubbornly reinforces a literary way of looking at things.By Will
Joyner.
</P>
<P>
   IAN-MCKELLEN-FILMS (Leeds, England) _ There is something rather
touching about Ian McKellen's new enthusiasm for cinema. Now, at
59, he has acquired an appetite to work in movies, to do what for
the best part of four decades he found unappealing. Is it fame that
he is after? By Alan Riding. With Photo.
</P>
<P>
   FASCISM-MOVIES (Undated) _ Humor may be, in its essence,
anti-fascistic: It takes what is most self-important, most
unyielding and most unforgiving, and dissolves it into absurdity.
Fascism meets its match in farce. That is the approach, delicately
taken, of the new Italian film ``Life is Beautiful,'' the winner of
the grand jury prize at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival. By Edward
Rothstein.
</P>
<P>
   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   THEATER-WIT-CANBY (New York) _ In ``Wit'' the main character
dies at the end but, for the next two hours that pass in a wink,
the audience is treated to the kind of theatrical experience of
which legends are made. We come to know and appreciate the mind and
substance of this singular character and of the playwright who
conceived her, as well as the ravishing potential of the singular
actress who plays Vivian: Kathleen Chalfant.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   AZNAVOUR-MUSIC (Paris) _ Charles Aznavour may well be the only
person who remembers his first visit to New York in 1948. This
week, as Aznavour embarks on a new American tour, public
recognition is the least of his problems. Having sold close to 100
million albums, he now enjoys the magical status of international
musical legend. By Alan Riding.
</P>
<P>
   JUDY-GARLAND-MUSIC (Undated) _ Until the release of ``Judy'' (32
Records), a four-CD career retrospective that comes with an
excellent video showing highlights from her 1963-64 television
variety show, Judy Garland's recorded legacy was scattered among
several different labels. This set, produced by Joel Dorn and his
son, Adam, with the Garland archivist Scott Schechter, encompasses
the breadth of Garland's recording career. By Stephen Holden.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-NOVELTIES (Undated) _ Planned obsolescence may work well
in the auto industry but less well in classical music, which has
invested the bulk of its holdings in the used-symphony and
used-opera business, and has lots of trouble convincing listeners
that the new models are any good. By Bernard Holland.

   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   PRINCE-EDWARD-TV (London) _ Prince Edward, 34, the youngest son
of Queen Elizabeth, is beginning to see some financial success in
his own film production company, Ardent Productions. And although
competitors in Britain's television industry complain that he is
shamelessly trading on his connections to advance his career, he
has managed to insure new-found respect for Ardent by crossing the
all-important continental divide and selling a number of his

   PARIS-FASHION (Paris) _ Men, naked but for a diaper, writhing
sensually like Nijinsky on a bed of pink rose petals, are not what
a fashion-show audience comes to see. But few would be telling the
truth if they claimed that they minded this backdrop to the bounty
of airy, magical dresses and redoubtable slithery suits that were
the John Galliano collection. By Constance C.R. White.
</P>
<P>
   FIELDS-RICHARD (Undated) _ On Wednesday night, a double-A list
of the friends and clients of Bertram Fields gathered at the ``21''
Club to offer congratulations. Another legal victory for the
swashbuckling Hollywood attorney? Not exactly. This time, Fields,
who has done legal battle on behalf of Tom Cruise, James Cameron,
the Beatles and nearly every major film studio, was being feted for
a scholarly book in defense of an altogether different client,
Richard III. By Andrew Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   ROLEX-ENVY (Undated) _ Rolex is the main noun in the
international language of success. By Stephan Talty.
</P>
<P>
   GRACE-SLICK (New York) _ Somehow the Palm Court at the Plaza
Hotel, with its harpist and doilied dessert plates, seems like the
last place where Grace Slick would want to meet. But here she
comes, dressed mostly in black, looking startlingly like herself
even though the Feed Your Head Queen of Jefferson Airplane, the
voice that launched a thousand trips with her 1960's anthem ``White
Rabbit,'' turns 60 next year. Judging from how good she looks,
either she took far fewer drugs than anyone imagined, or the
cosmetics industry should start marketing an LSD eye cream. By Alex
Witchel.
</P>
<P>
   GLAM-ROCK (New York) _ Gabe Doppelt was scrambling. As VH-1's
creative director of fashion, Ms. Doppelt co-produces the cable
music channel's annual Fashion Awards, and each year she
commissions designers to create outfits for the show's opening,
purportedly around a rock-related theme. But, she admits, ``Every
year I look for the appropriate collision of fashion and music, and
I never really find it.'' This year promised to be no different,
until Ms. Doppelt heard that a movie about the glam rock movement
had won an award at the Cannes film festival, and her antennae
began buzzing. By David Handelman.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ Some worthy plants are victims of
gardeners' prejudice, among them marigolds because of their scent,
goldenrod because it resembles ragweed and gladioluses because they
are so often the flower of choice at funerals. By Cass Petersen.

   WEEK IN REVIEW
</P>
<P>
   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Oct. 18, will move Saturday in the `a' category. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MCCARTHYISM-REVIEW (Undated) _ Recently declassified Soviet and
U.S. documents indicate there was some truth to Sen. Joseph
McCarthy's charge that communist agents were at work in the U.S.
The data has unleashed a flood of scholarship and revived old
debates. By Ethan Bronner.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-ECON-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ The Israeli business community
and foreign investors have a deep interest in seeing a genuine
Israeli-Palestinian accord. While the political arguments have
focused on security and land, the economic case for achieving peace
is a powerful background factor as Netanyahu and Arafat meet. By
William Orme Jr.
</P>
<P>
   POLLS-VOTERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ With the Republican-led House
moving toward an impeachment investigation of President Clinton,
voter turnout will be especially important this year; polls on who
will turn out are therefore also important. A look at how to assess
pre-election polls. By Michael R. Kagay.
</P>
<P>
   HATE-CRIMES-REVIEW (Houston) _ Laws against hate crimes raise a
paradox: such laws are designed to magnify an offense and show our
condemnation of it, but in extreme cases such as murder, these laws
may be unnecessary, since the person convicted would probably get
the maximum punishment anyway. By Rick Lyman.
</P>
<P>
   BAD-SAMARITANS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The case of David Cash, who
witnessed a fatal attack on a child but did nothing to intervene or
report it, has revived a longstanding debate about whether
bystanders should have a legal duty to help strangers in peril. By
Jeff Stryker.
</P>
<P>
   ANCIENT-SEX-SCANDAL-REVIEW (Undated) _ In a coincidence
confirming that sex in politics is truly ancient news, the Semitic
Museum of Harvard University is exhibiting cuneiform tablets from a
corruption-and-sex investigation from Mesopotamia circa 1400 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-U.S.-BANKS-REVIEW (Washington) _ There are striking
parallels between the United States in the late 1980s as it
struggled to address its savings &AMP; loan crisis and Japan in 1998 as
it faces a banking system near collapse. Those similarities offer
lessons about what and what not to do. By Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   SACRILEGIOUS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The play ``Corpus Christi'' has
refueled debate over a purported double standard: is offending
Christians not as bad as offending other religious or ethnic
groups? But the deeper and more complicated issue is what is fair
and what goes over the line in dealing with religious themes. By
Peter Applebome.
</P>
<P>
   STARR-REVIEW (Washington) _ Democrats want to make Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr their chief witness at the House impeachment
hearings. A look at whether this would help or hurt their cause. By
Jill Abramson.
</P>
<P>
   BIG-NUMBERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The numbers: they keep getting
bigger. Partly because of recent financial developments, gigantic
figures like a trillion have become less abstract and more real. By
Michael T. Kaufman.

   EXCLUSIVE-COLUMBIA-HCA (Undated) _ Exclusive interview with
James F. Alderson, the small-town accountant who filed suit on
behalf of the United States charging four giant hospital companies
with fraud. For years Alderson stewed with the belief that the
companies _ the huge Hospital Corp. of America and three of its
corporate spinoffs _ had cheated the government with bogus expense
claims. While working at a Montana hospital run by one of those
companies, Alderson himself had been instructed to create a second
set of books recording different expenses than those reported to

 Money Power _ Utilities Bankroll `No on 9' Campaign   By Rebecca Smith  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Proposition 9, the electric-rate rollback measure, is shaping up as
the most lopsided fight in this election, with opponents
outspending proponents by a 30-to-1 margin.
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 99 percent of the ``No on 9'' money has come from
California's three giant electric utilities _ Pacific Gas and
Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas &AMP;
Electric, &UR;  &LR; according to Chronicle research.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's safe to say this is the most lopsided campaign'' this
year, said Kim Alexander, president of the California Voter
Foundation in Sacramento, a nonprofit research group.
</P>
<P>
   Some of $30.1 million raised by the ``No on 9'' campaign has
ended up in unusual hands, including the Democratic and Republican
parties, the firm co-owned by California Senator Steve Peace, who
helped write the state's electric deregulation law, and Los Angeles
television personality David Horowitz.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The state's deregulation law allowed the big three utilities
to continue charging consumers for investments in nuclear plants
that would become uneconomical in a free market.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 9 proponents call that deal a ``bailout'' and want
the utilities' shareholders, not their customers, to pay off about
$6 billion in debts on the nuclear plants.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would force the utilities to cut their rates by at
least 10 percent _ on top of a 10 percent rate cut that took effect
January 1.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents _ who include consumer activists Ralph Nader and
Harvey Rosenfield, author of the 1988 insurance-rate rollback
measure, Proposition 103 _ raised just $1.22 million through
September 30.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of that money was spent to gather the 700,000
signatures needed to get the measure on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any money,'' said Nettie Hoge, Proposition 9
proponent and executive director of The Utility Reform Network in
San Francisco. ``You won't be seeing any TV, any radio ads from us.
All we've got is `Yes on 9' buttons.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, opponents of Proposition 9 have raised $30.1
million, of which $29.8 million came from the three investor-owned
utilities. By law, these campaign contributions must be paid by
shareholders, not ratepayers.
</P>
<P>
   With Proposition 9 money mostly pouring into one coffer, the
result for voters is a one-sided shout of radio and television
commercials. The message opponents are trying to drive home is that
Proposition 9 is a deceptive initiative that would raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The utilities vow that if Proposition 9 passes, they will sue
the state for reneging on the deregulation deal. If they win that
case, they say taxpayers will wind up paying for any rate
reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the ``No on 9'' campaign's expenditures have raised
eyebrows:
</P>
<P>
   _The campaign paid $106,000 to Horowitz, whose ``Fight Back with
David Horowitz'' television show has been syndicated for 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Emmy-winning Horowitz made a 28-minute ``special show''
appearing on cable TV stations that purports to uncover the
``secret rip-offs'' of the Proposition 9 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Although the program has a slim ``No on 9'' banner across the
top of the screen, some viewers might mistake it for a television
news show.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Horowitz cites an ``independent study'' that warns
of huge tax increases if Proposition 9 passes. He doesn't disclose
that the author of the study, Metropolitan West Securities of
Sacramento, was paid $103,974 by the ``No on 9'' campaign.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Horowitz bristles at suggestions the video exploits his name
and reputation and objects to descriptions of his Proposition 9
show as an ``infomercial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an educational program,'' said Horowitz. ``An infomercial
sells something. This is not selling anything. I don't do
infomercials.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The ``No on 9'' campaign donated $500,000 to both the
Republican and Democratic parties after they pledged to oppose the
measure. ``The money is to help (the parties) communicate their
feelings to their party members in slate mailers,'' said Allan
Zaremberg, chairman of the ``No on 9'' coalition and president of
the California Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders say those donations, though legal, give the appearance
of a quid pro quo in which endorsements were sold. ``It's very
unusual, if not unprecedented, for money to come out of a campaign
and into a political party,'' said Bruce Cain, associate director
of the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of
California at Berkeley. ``Money usually goes the other way,'' from
parties to campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   _ The campaign paid $39,641 to a film-production company
co-owned by Peace, D-San Diego. Payment covered production work on
the Horowitz video.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand it may subject me to criticism,'' said Peace,
chief financial officer of Four Square Productions and chairman of
the Senate Energy, Utilities and Communications Committee. ``But
I'm not going to tell my partners they can't do business with
someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Key to the ``No on 9'' campaign are the endorsements that run
like movie credits at the end of its commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has garnered hundreds of endorsements, from the
League of California Cities, California Labor Federation, both
candidates for governor and others.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Yes on 9'' side has only a few endorsements, including
Consumer's Union, The Utility Reform Network, environmentalist
David Brower, singer Bonnie Raitt and the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for endorsements, the ``No on 9'' side has a huge
advantage: starting with a combined &UR;  &LR; utility workforce of 39,000
people, any of whom can be tapped for service.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E has distributed campaign volunteer cards to many of its
20,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Watsonville's acting mayor, Oscar Rios, said he endorsed the
``No on 9'' campaign after a PG&AMP;E employee approached him. ``They
contact you and say, this is the reason we would like you to be
against it,'' Rios said. ``If no one had contacted me, I wouldn't
necessarily have taken a position.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign workers have found a willing ear in many communities,
because of the utilities' history of community service and
charitable giving. PG&AMP;E, for example, donated $9.9 million to 735
community organizations last year. All told, the three utilities
gave charities $21.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives them lots of chits they can call in,'' said Jim
Shultz, director of San Francisco's Democracy Center, a nonprofit
that encourages grassroots politicking.
</P>
<P>
   Not all endorsements work out as smoothly as intended. A ``No on
9'' endorsement by the Consumer Federation of California has split
the organization _ a coalition of labor and consumer groups.
</P>
<P>
   The ruckus began when a Consumer Federation committee
recommended that the organization remain neutral on Proposition 9
since members were deeply divided.
</P>
<P>
   When utility worker unions pushed for the vote anyway _ and the
board voted to oppose the proposition _ six of the board's 36
members resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Nelson quit because she didn't want her name used by a
campaign she opposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're an alliance. You can't take a position on an issue like
this when the members are so divided,'' said Nelson, president of
Mill Valley's Consumer Research Foundation, a nonprofit educational
group.
</P>
<P>
   Even without $30 million and hundreds of endorsements, the ``No
on 9'' campaign had a big advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Political experts say California voters, frustrated at being
asked to decide complexities that they feel are the responsibility
of the state Legislature to sort out, are in a mood to vote down
most initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of studies indicate that `no' money is more powerful
than `yes' money,'' said Cain, of UC Berkeley. ``And if they have
more money, too, then you get something called the `asymmetrical
negative spending' effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, this means the odds greatly favor the `no'
side.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Recent Field Poll data bears this out. Results show voters
oppose Proposition 9 by a 2-to-1 margin, though 36 percent still
are undecided.

 D.E. Shaw Explains BofA Loss   By Sam Zuckerman  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The Wall Street firm whose complex investment strategy generated
huge losses for BankAmerica Corp. got into trouble when the prices
of U.S. government securities soared while the markets for other
kinds of debt collapsed, the firm's founder and chief executive
said yesterday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Shaw, the computer scientist who heads D.E. Shaw &AMP; Co.,
said in an interview on the cable TV financial network CNBC that
his firm's strategy was to sell Treasury bonds and buy riskier debt
instruments, hoping to garner profits if the price gap between the
two kinds of investments narrowed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, just the opposite happened in recent weeks, causing the
portfolio that the firm managed for BankAmerica to plunge in value.
Shaw said the losses were magnified when other firms with similar
investments began to dump their holdings.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we missed _ and it's an important lack and something I
feel very bad about _ is the magnitude of a risk factor that we had
identified but turned out to be much worse than we expected: the
effect of forced liquidations in the market,'' Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw managed $20 billion in debt securities for San Francisco's
BankAmerica, one of several portfolios it ran for the bank in
exchange for a $1.4 billion loan. The two companies split profits
and losses 50-50.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's debt portfolio tanked when Long-Term Capital Management,
a giant investment fund with a similar strategy, nearly collapsed
late in September.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's losses in the BankAmerica debt portfolio prompted the
bank to take a $372 million write-off when it reported profits
Wednesday for the September quarter. The report was issued two
weeks after North Carolina's NationsBank Corp. bought the San
Francisco bank and took its name.
</P>
<P>
   The new BankAmerica agreed to buy the entire debt portfolio from
Shaw, which otherwise might have been forced to sell securities at
fire-sale prices.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said the firm's losses were multiplied because it borrowed
heavily to build up the size of the BankAmerica debt portfolio.
Analysts estimate that it took on $19 in short-term loans for every
$1 BankAmerica lent it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question we used more leverage than, with the
benefit of hindsight, we should have,'' said Shaw, a Columbia
University professor before he founded the firm 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said his firm remains financially healthy and that its
other investments continue to be profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Both Long-Term Capital and Shaw use computers to trade on tiny
variations in the prices of securities in different markets.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a New York law firm filed a class-action suit
accusing Hugh McColl, chief executive of the new BankAmerica, of
concealing the bank's Shaw losses when he spoke at a post-merger
news conference at the beginning of the month.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a Wall Street Journal article about BankAmerica
and Shaw, Representative Edward Markey, D-Mass., asked the SEC
yesterday to clarify what information is considered ``material''
and therefore must be made public immediately, Bloomberg News
reported.
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica said in a statement issued yesterday that it
disclosed Shaw's losses ``as they were known.''

 Official Warns Banks Against Loose Lending   By Sam Zuckerman  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The day after the Federal Reserve warned of a looming credit
crunch, a top U.S. regulator came to San Francisco to admonish
bankers that their lending standards are too loose.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a speech at a meeting of bankers and bank regulators
yesterday, Julie Williams, the acting comptroller of the currency,
said the current global economic slowdown means that bankers must
be especially careful in making loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not succumb to the temptation to declare victory over
lax underwriting of new loans,'' Williams declared.'
</P>
<P>
   Williams' stance highlights the conflict between those
policymakers who worry about overly aggressive lending and those
who fear that a clampdown on credit could tank the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve officials have been sounding the alarm that
risk-wary bankers are pulling back from lending. If that continues,
they warn, the economy could be starved for credit, turning a
slowdown into a full-fledged recession.
</P>
<P>
   When it announced its move to cut short-term interest rates on
Thursday, the Fed cited ``growing caution by lenders'' as a key
reason for its action.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters after her address, Williams said she only
wants bankers to steer clear of imprudent loans, such as those made
to high-flying investment funds that have produced billions of
dollars in losses in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want banks to stop lending,'' Williams said. ``We
just want to make sure that if economic times get a little choppy,
they are going to remain healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Long-Term Capital Management, the giant hedge
fund that nearly collapsed last month, lenders appeared to have
been overawed by the firm's managers, which included two Nobel
Prize-winning economists, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The lenders ``don't appear to have understood exactly what the
firm was doing with all of that money,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica Corp. earlier this week reported a $372 million
write-off on a loan to D.E. Shaw &AMP; Co., a Wall Street firm that
uses computer-driven investment techniques similar to those that
brought down Long-Term Capital.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, whose agency regulates BankAmerica, declined to
comment on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Williams became interim chief of the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency, one of three federal bank regulatory
agencies, while the Senate considers President Clinton's nomination
of Washington tax lawyer John Hawke for the job. Williams formerly
was the agency's top lawyer.

 With Founders Gone, How Will PalmPilot Fare in 3Com's Hands?   By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Now that its three guiding spirits have left Palm Computing, some
people wonder how the plucky little PalmPilot will fare in the
hands of 3Com Corp.
<TEXT>
<P>
   PalmPilot is the pocket-size gizmo that stores phone numbers and
calendar entries and retrieves e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Launched in 1996 by technical guru Jeff Hawkins, business maven
Donna Dubinsky and marketing chief Ed Colligan, the PalmPilot
became such a hit that Palm Computing, the device's parent company,
was acquired by U.S. Robotics, which in turn, was bought by 3Com.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Palm's founding trio have quit 3Com to form a
new startup, JD Technology. At the Agenda Conference on Tuesday in
Phoenix, JD will announce plans for a new generation of handheld
devices based on the Palm operating system, which they have
licensed from 3Com.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Mann, editor of Handheld Systems Magazine in San Luis
Obispo, wonders whether Palm Computing will be able to keep up its
growth now that it has lost the people who provided its
entrepreneurial soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd give (the Palm division) 18 months on the basis of their
current momentum,'' Mann said. ``Beyond that, it's a crap shoot
unless 3Com gets some inspired new leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Janice Roberts, the 3Com senior vice president who now runs Palm
Computing, said it's not as if all the talent walked out the door
with Hawkins, Dubinsky and Colligan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're approaching 400 full-time employees inside Palm,'' said
Roberts, adding that it was the company's very size and success
that prompted the founders to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sound political or bureaucratic or slow, but
managing a business that has grown this large doesn't appeal to
everyone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins and Dubinsky were on their way to Phoenix for their
``coming out'' presentation at Agenda and could not be reached. But
Colligan tried to dispel notions that their departures heralded
Palm's demise.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times when founders leave it's a bad sign, but
nothing would be further from the truth,'' he said. ``Palm is going
through the roof. I'd like to say it's cause we set it up so
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Roberts acknowledged a culture clash between Palm and
3Com. Palm must cope not only with growth _ the division should
have more than $500 million in revenues this year _ but also with
the strain of being a corporate stepchild.
</P>
<P>
   Palm is building two buildings in Santa Clara, which are
separated from 3Com headquarters by a creek. ``The team here calls
it the moat,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Purdy, editor of the Mobile Letter, an industry
newsletter, is betting that 3Com will help Palm mature without
stifling its creativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realize that 3Com's new president, Bruce Claflin, used to head
the group at IBM that licensed the Palm technology,'' Purdy said.
``This is the most successful handheld computer ever. 3Com's not
going to throw that away.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Purple Prose: &LR;  Is Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison the
inspiration for the male character in a romance novel titled ``A
Hard Hearted Man''?
</P>
<P>
   That's what enquiring minds want to know based on some
tantalizing evidence linking the book's author, Melanie Craft of
San Francisco, with the software magnate.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that Craft and Ellison did attend a state dinner
together last October, which President and Mrs. Clinton put on to
honor Chinese President Jiang Zemin. And a source close to Ellison
confirmed that the software billionaire and the author have been
involved in more than affairs of state.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, it's just conjecture whether the Ross Bradford
character in Craft's novel is loosely modeled on Ellison. On the
surface, the answer is no. The novel is set in Africa, where
Bradford, a handsome, middle-aged land baron, becomes enamored of
Lilah Evans, a headstrong 28-year-old archaeologist.
</P>
<P>
   But after peeling back the physical layer, some similarities
appear. Bradford's heart is hardened by a rough childhood that
inoculates him against love, just as Ellison, who was given up for
adoption, had a rocky relationship with his adoptive parents.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are descriptions such as the one describing
Bradford ``as a Roman emperor, powerful and remote.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, any Ellison parallels may be imaginary or, at best,
wishful thinking on Craft's part. I couldn't reach the author for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The story ends happily, with Evans accepting the diamond
engagement ring proffered by that ``hard-hearted, hard-bodied man
who melted her defenses and made her feel want _ and love.''
</P>
<P>

TROJANS WILL TEST REBOUNDING GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PULLMAN, Wash. _ The research was completed late this week and
an already dubious accomplishment became a record. No USC team has
ever blown a 21-point second-half lead, so last week's 32-31 loss
to Cal was the biggest collapse ever suffered by the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the hard part.
</P>
<P>
   The reeling Trojans must overcome that demoralizing loss in the
hostile environment that is the Palouse, when they visit Washington
State tonight at 7:15.
</P>
<P>
   It will be chilly. It will be dark. It might be wet. And USC's
season likely hangs in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking forward to it. I've heard so many things,''
freshman quarterback Carson Palmer said. ``I talked to a couple
girls on the soccer team who were just up there. They said it's
terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer only said what most of the players are thinking, although
the Trojans have won their past four games in Pullman. Perhaps it
is more a question of whether the Trojans can forget the Cal loss
long enough to regain their morale against Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   USC (4-2, 2-1) appears to have gotten off to a nice start, but
last week's disaster has thrown everything _ including a bowl
appearance and the team's confidence _ into question.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident,'' Palmer said. ``We know we should have beat
Cal.''
</P>
<P>
   USC's final six games are considerably tougher than the first
six, and while Washington State (3-3, 0-3) might be struggling,
this isn't exactly a road-tested Trojans team. It enjoyed five of
its first six games at the Coliseum, with a trip to Florida State
the only time it left Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real crossroads game for us,'' USC coach Paul
Hackett said. ``How do we bounce back from what was a very
disappointing one-point loss? It will be a real benchmark game for
us in terms of how we respond to adversity. How does this team
respond to a tough situation?''
</P>
<P>
   Always trying to create an us-against-the-world mentality in
even good circumstances, Hackett actually didn't need to resort to
propaganda to assess the Trojans' current atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's buried us,'' Hackett said. ``The only way to put
it behind you is to play another game.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if it has to be at Washington State. And for the first
time, a game on artificial surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is their season. This is their bowl,'' Hackett said.
``This is a big game for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   That last statement is beyond dispute. The Trojans continue to
have the worst passing offense in the Pacific-10 Conference, and
now even the defense is coming under scrutiny. It has given up more
than 400 yards a game the past three contests and appeared to wear
down for the first time in last week's loss to California.
</P>
<P>
   It has been torched by Arizona State tailback J.R. Redmond (214
yards) and Cal wide receiver Dameane Douglas (13 receptions) the
past two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you evaluate the first half of the season, the strength of
the team is defense,'' Hackett said. ``We still believe we have a
good defense.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the offense, a lot could sway on how tailback Chad Morton
performs. Morton (bruised back) said he can play, but Hackett
doesn't want to make a final decision until kickoff. Even then, he
is worried that one hard hit on the artificial turf could aggravate
Morton's injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't play the game with Chad Morton, it's a different
game,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: With a close battle at center, Hackett had not decided
whether Eric Denmon or Matt McShane would start. ``Flip a coin,''
he said. Linebacker Mark Cusano (sore thigh) will play but
sophomore Zeke Moreno will start. Right guard Travis Claridge might
be forced to play some right tackle tonight if starter Ken Bowen
encounters any problems. The Trojans are shorthanded because Matt
Welch has mononucleosis and did not make the trip.

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ When Jaumal Bradley pulls off his shoulder
pads, his nicked, worn torso exposes the scars where bullets grazed
him and knives cut his flesh. His arms are big, strong and defined,
but there's a portion near the bicep he detests. Tattoos tell the
tale of his adolescent life. Markings of a gang.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his Cal State Northridge teammates know the story. Many
others don't ask because it's not really cool to ask.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a junior running back making his first start tonight,
is particularly quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have time, I'll tell you all about it,'' Bradley was
saying. ``All about how I got here.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, with No. 16 CSUN not playing at Sacramento State
until 6:05 p.m., time was available. That's when Bradley embarked
on a doozy of a tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 14, I was involved in gangs,'' Bradley said. ``I
was committed to the California Youth Authority at age 15. I did 7{
years in the California Youth Authority. For gang involvement. I
started hangin' with the wrong crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the wrong place at the wrong time and I had to take
responsibility for that instead of telling on somebody. My natural
leadership ability showed but in a negative way.''
</P>
<P>
   He went from being a star at Gahr High in Cerritos to jail.
</P>
<P>
   At some point during his sentence, between race riots and
stabbings inside, Bradley said his isolation helped him develop
peace of mind.
</P>
<P>
   The day Bradley was released from jail he showed up at Mt. San
Antonio College in Walnut, a second-chance-type place where
football coach Bill Fisk accepts once-troubled kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was recommended as being a good, hard worker from someone I
know with the (California Youth Authority),'' Fisk said. ``They
didn't want him going back to his neighborhood. He called us and he
was a serious student and a serious athlete. He was either
studying, on the football field or in the weight room lifting when
he was here.''
</P>
<P>
   In 18 months, Bradley rose to captain of Mt. SAC's football team
and was an integral part of a national-championship team that went
13-0 last season. He also worked a pair of jobs _ busing tables and
parking cars _ while going to school and earning his associate's
degree with a 3.6 GPA.
</P>
<P>
   College recruiters believed he was reformed, and Fisk said some
high-profile programs inquired. But there was a catch. As part of
his sentence, he wasn't allowed to leave California before his 25th
birthday _ which isn't until January.
</P>
<P>
   So CSUN, which Bradley didn't even know about, became an option.
Then Bradley met first-year coach Ron Ponciano.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' Bradley said, ``I fell him love with coach Ponciano
the first day I saw him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano shares an equal fondness toward Bradley. Strong
practices and an extreme unselfishness pushed Bradley, who missed
spring ball because of ankle surgery, into the backfield mix. He
led CSUN with eight carries, which produced 21 yards, and had four
catches in last week's upset of Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the most unselfish player I've been around, along with
(linebacker) Brennen Swanson,'' Ponciano said. ``When it's a bad
situation, he'll usually find something positive to say, and that's
a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley speaks from experience. He's seen the depths of race
riots in jail, of spending 23 hours a day in a 110-degree cell. He
does community speeches and serves not as an example to many of his
cousins.
</P>
<P>
   His good behavior since leaving jail prompted the California
Youth Authority to give him an early discharge, making him able to
leave the state.
</P>
<P>
   He has a 14-month-old daughter, Jaion, and is engaged to Tyna
Hall. He's also on track to graduate with a degree in urban studies
and is playing football for a ranked team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any pressures or problems right now. I'm free,''
Bradley said. ``I don't have any parole or probation or
restrictions at all. I have a 1-year-old daughter. I'm doing well
in school. We're winning. My life is fine.''

 &HT;    Gangs may face Indian `circles'
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon and Angela Shah
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Three months after filing Texas' first gang
injunction, Travis County District Attorney Ronnie Earle is looking
to break more new ground, floating the idea of bringing neighbors
and accused criminals together in ``circles,'' a dispute resolution
technique borrowed from Native American tradition.
</P>
<P>
   And the five people targeted by the gang injunction _ a court
order that makes them subject to arrest for congregating in a
Northeast Austin neighborhood where they allegedly sold drugs _
could be among the first test cases.
</P>
<P>
   Earle's office has approached East Austin religious leaders as
well as the lawyers of the gang injunction defendants to discuss
the idea of having defendants, accompanied by people close to them,
sit down with neighbors and crime victims so everyone can talk
about how offenders can make amends to the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea here is to give the power back to the
neighborhood,'' Earle said. ``(Circles) are very effective in
holding offenders accountable in ways that the traditional criminal
justice system does not do.''
</P>
<P>
   Earle said circles were widely used by Native Americans and
other indigenous people around the world. In recent years, the idea
has caught on in the American criminal justice system. Earle said
he learned more about them from a judge from Canada's Yukon
Territory and later watched the circle process on a Minnesota
Indian reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it would work: An accused criminal _ Earle said those
accused of drug and low-level property crimes like burglary would
be the best candidates _ would choose a family member or someone
close to them and meet with their victim or with residents from the
neighborhood where the crime was committed.
</P>
<P>
   Earle said a prosecutor would also be in the room, and judges,
probation officers or others familiar with the case could choose to
attend. The defendant could opt to bring his or her defense lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of a trial atmosphere, Earle said, each person would
speak in turn and say whatever he wanted. There would be no debate
or interruptions. The defendant and his representatives could
describe what kind of person he is and the circumstances
surrounding the incident. Victims could express their anger.
Neighbors could talk about how crimes affect their peace of mind.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant would have to accept responsibility for the crime,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then everyone involved would try to come to an agreement on the
proper punishment, Earle said. And that could be anything from
going back to school to some form of creative community service to
jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a consensus, we're going to follow the recommendation
of the circle'' and take that recommendation before a judge, Earle
said.
</P>
<P>
   Earle thinks going eyeball-to-eyeball with neighbors will make
more of an impression on offenders than another trip through the
revolving door of the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   And he's dangling the possibility before the defendants in the
gang injunction, who are currently under court order barring them
from hanging out together, loitering near pay phones, and other
activities in the area around Cameron Road and Broadmoor Drive in
Northeast Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The injunction is a civil action, not a criminal charge, and is
currently temporary. A full trial is scheduled for Nov. 9 before
District Judge Wil Flowers. The defendants have fought the
injunction, saying they are not gang members or drug dealers and
the action violates their civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Williams, a defense lawyer representing defendant Percy
Prejean _ who is in jail after having his probation on a drug
charge revoked _ said he plans to recommend that Prejean
participate in the circle if Earle can pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than having Big Brother take care of the problems, the
community takes care of the problem, and I like that,'' Williams
said. ``If (Earle's office) had come up with this before violating
everybody's rights and trampling on the Constitution, we would have
said, `That Ronnie Earle is really innovative, we support him.'''
</P>
<P>
   The other lawyers have not decided whether to participate, said
Ann Del Llano, president of the American Civil Liberties Union
local chapter and a lawyer for Shang Yahoshua, another of the
injunction defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Del Llano said she became very interested in the circle idea
after Earle's office started talking about reduced sentences for
two pending drug charges if Yahoshua participates in a circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start talking like that, people come to the table in
a hurry,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Earle declined to comment on how the circles would affect the
injunction or specific criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Austin police officer Darryl Jamail, who patrols Northeast
Austin, said he is skeptical that an agreement forged at a meeting
would keep the alleged drug dealers away from the target
neighborhood for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deal with (the defendants) every day and I see the attitude
of `I'm going to break the law anyway,' '' Jamail said. ``If it
doesn't have teeth in it, I don't think this is a good option.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamail said the temporary injunction granted by Flowers in
August is working well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very noticeable difference,'' he said, ``and without
the drug dealers out there you don't have the buyers creating
traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Rotter, a long-time resident of the nearby Pecan Springs
neighborhood who has worked with police and prosecutors to fight
crime in Northeast Austin, said he is also skeptical, but willing
to try.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the fact that they are gang members in the first
place, I wonder about their sincerity,'' Rotter said. ``They don't
really care how their activities affect other people who live
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I will come if it'll make a difference,'' he said.

PADRES AIM TO DERAIL YANKEE EXPRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He is the American League batting champion for the
winningest team in American League history. He plays center field
in the baseball capital of the world. But ask the New York Yankees'
Bernie Williams about his season, and he pauses, digesting it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get so caught up in thinking, `Do, do, accomplish, goals,
let's go, do it, do it,' that we sometimes lose sight of what we
have done,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   What Williams and the Yankees have done this year is astounding.
An AL-record 114 wins, a sweep in the Division Series and a
six-game victory in the American League Championship have brought
them to their 35th World Series and second in three years.
</P>
<P>
   The first was a celebration for an underdog team that knocked
off the defending champion Atlanta Braves. This one, against the
San Diego Padres, sets up as a vindication of their seasonlong
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '96, we weren't supposed to win,'' said shortstop Derek
Jeter. ``This year, we're supposed to win. That's the biggest
difference. Everyone expected us to get here, but we expected us to
get here, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great season, no matter what happens. I don't think
(losing) would make our season a failure, but it would be a huge
disappontment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres, making their first World Series appearance since
1984, are certainly a worthy foe. No Series ever has pitted two
teams with more combined victories than this one. The Yankees and
Padres won 212 regular-season games, two better than the Orioles
and Reds in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is New York, and the Yankees are a team so
decorated, they already have a set of rings from 1998. Those came
courtesy of pitcher and part-time jeweler David Wells, who had
rings made up for his teammates after his perfect game in May.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, who opposes Kevin Brown in Game 1 of the 94th World
Series Saturday night, showed imperfect judgment on Thursday,
declaring on Howard Stern's radio show that the Yankees would beat
the Padres in five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``BALK RADIO,'' teased the Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   ``YANKS IN FIVE!'' chirped the Post.
</P>
<P>
   As New Yorker Billy Joel might chime in, ``You had to be a big
shot, didn't you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the people out there, no, I am not predicting anything in
five,'' said Wells, who explained he was mostly trying to get Stern
to move on to another topic. ``I think San Diego is an outstanding
team, and I don't think it is fair to myself, my teammates or
anybody else out there, even the Padres, to predict anything like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   If recent history is a barometer, Wells probably will be wrong
anyway. The last six World Series all have lasted at least six
games, a streak unsurpassed in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres, underdogs in beating the Houston Astros and the
Braves en route to the pennant, are making just their second World
Series appearance. The first was in 1984, when San Diego lost _
yes, in five _ to a Detroit Tigers team that won 104 regular-season
games. These Yankees are the only AL team since then to post more
victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (World Series) was something that the city always has
talked about since, because we don't have the great tradition of
the Yankees where it happens all the time,'' said Padres third base
coach Tim Flannery, who played for the '84 team. ``That was our
year. We had come from behind in dramatic fashion to beat the Cubs
to get to the World Series to face an incredibly talented Detroit
team who was destined to win everything that year.
</P>
<P>
   `` ... But if you're asking me if I think we're going to get our
(butts) kicked by these guys like we did against the Detroit
Tigers, we don't look at it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ignore that smiling, swinging Friar mascot, and there's
not much about the Padres that looks out of place in this setting.
They have a bona fide ace in Brown, a Hall of Famer in Gwynn, a
50-home run bopper in Greg Vaughn, a Gold Glover and former MVP at
third base in Ken Caminiti and baseball's premier closer, Trevor
Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   They're also battle-tested. Eleven Padres were on playoff teams
before arriving in San Diego, and eight others have prior
experience with the Padres, who lost in the Division Series two
years ago. This is a team assembled for this stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``What separates teams when they get to this arena is experience
above the shoulders,'' said Padres general manager Kevin Towers.
``You have to have talent to get here, but sometimes youth and
inexperience overcome you. A team like this is not in awe of
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but this, unmistakably, is New York, home to 49 World
Series. When the Yankees host their 35th starting Saturday night,
baseball will feel right at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be wild,'' Jeter said. ``It's like a Broadway
play, center stage. The World Series seems like it only should be
played in New York.''

MARK MARTIN, DRIVEN TO SUCCEED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Mark Martin says there is perhaps only one
way left for him to overhaul Jeff Gordon and win the 1998 NASCAR
Winston Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we can win it except by default. Like, if he
\RGordon\S got hurt,'' Martin said. ``And I don't want to win it
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   At the tail end of the self-described greatest season of his
racing career, victory by default will not cut it for the
obsessive/compulsive Martin. Nor would it have set well with Julian
Martin, Mark's father, who was killed in a plane crash Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   His relentless pursuit of Gordon for what would be Martin's
first Cup championship has been juxtaposed against a similarly
determined effort to learn what caused the twin-engined plane
piloted by his father to go down. The crash, near the Great Basin
National Park in Nevada, also took the lives of Julian's wife and
Mark's stepmother, Shelley, and their daughter, Sarah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to know what got my hero,'' Martin said of his
father, who was 62 and an accomplished pilot. ``He was nicknamed in
the '70s `The Cat,' because he had to have had nine lives to live
through the '70s. And he went \Rdied\S in the late '90s, if that
tells you how many times he cheated death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to know what happened to him.''
</P>
<P>
   These have been the issues vying for Martin's undivided
attention this summer _ another race of one-on-one against Gordon;
another day alone with the memories of his fallen hero.
</P>
<P>
   Martin will start sixth tonight in the historic, inaugural
nighttime running of the Pepsi 400 at Daytona International
Speedway, 288 points behind Gordon with four races remaining.
Martin dropped 114 huge points to Gordon at the Winston 500 last
week at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama, and the consequences of
another plate-race scrape cannot be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do the math,'' said Martin, twice a runner-up this decade in
points chases involving seven-time champion Dale Earnhardt.
``Assuming that nothing goes wrong for us, and everything in the
world went upside down for them \RGordon and his crew\S, then the
race would be on. That's not much of a way to look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   With a career-high seven victories and 23 top-10 finishes in 29
starts, Martin has spent 1998 typically _ as he is fond of
describing it _ racing his guts out. But Gordon, the series
champion in 1995 and 1997, has maintained the top spot he assumed
after the Save Mart/Kragen 350 at Sears Point Raceway 14 races ago.
Gordon, who has a series-high 10 victories, has won seven of the
past 14 races and finished in the top five in the other seven.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, the cornerstone of team owner Jack Roush's five-car
stable, is the only driver to rank among the top 10 in the final
Winston Cup points standings from 1989-1997. That is nine
consecutive years that have been very good, but not good enough to
hoist the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might not be as good as Jeff Gordon. Maybe I shouldn't win a
championship,'' said Martin, 39. ``And I'm man enough to say it. I
won't measure myself against that. I won't measure myself against
how many championships I win. I've won a lot of races \R29 total\S.
That's important to me. I've been fairly successful. And I have a
decent amount of respect throughout the garage.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's single-mindedness about racing might have gotten him
past the initial shock of the fatal plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   He learned of the accident after he had run second, naturally,
to Gordon on the road course at Watkins Glen, N.Y. The next Friday,
Martin qualified the No. 6 Valvoline Ford Taurus fifth at Michigan
Speedway. On race day, he finished fourth and more or less berated
himself after the race for not delivering a victory in memory of
his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed at the focus he was able to give that weekend,''
said Jeff Burton, driver of the No. 99 Exide Batteries Ford and
Martin's team for Roush Racing. ``That made such an impression on
me _ and some people criticized him for that. I can't figure that
out. Everybody deals with things differently. And it would have
made Julian Martin mad for Mark not to run in that event. Mark
knows that. That comes with maturity.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup team owner Bill Davis, a longtime Martin family
friend, said Mark is in many respects a carbon copy of his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything they do, they've got to do it the best, the
hardest,'' said Davis, who got to know Mark through their fathers'
involvement in the trucking business in Arkansas. ``From drinking
to driving fast to staying up partying all night to running trucks
to race cars, it didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what a tough deal. Mark is having his greatest year ever
of racing and his dad isn't here to share it with him. I know
that's the hardest thing for him, because Julian dedicated his life
to Mark and to Mark's career in racing.''
</P>
<P>
   After Martin won the UAW-GM Quality 500 at Charlotte Motor
Speedway this month, Roush promised Martin that he would be part of
a championship with his team _ either as driver or participant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of things we're going to do beyond the time
when Mark drives these cars,'' Roush said. ``Mark is a great
championship driver. I've raced in many series for over 30 years
and I've never raced with anybody that has a better nose for
accumulating points and keeping his car out of harm's way than
Mark.''

PERFECT STAGE FOR GWYNN'S FIRST YANKEE STADIUM VISIT: GAME 1 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No one has ever called Tony Gwynn ``Mr. October.''
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, on the eve of the 1998 World Series, the man who has
played the sometimes-less-than-desirable role of ``Mr. Padre'' with
so much class for 16 seasons got his first look inside the place
where Octobers, and Mr. October, live eternal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've flown over Yankee Stadium. We've driven by it in a bus. I
mean, I had a cab take me here. I was going to Shea Stadium but he
took me here instead, so I've never been in the Stadium. Seen it
from TV. Seen it from the outside, but I'd never been in it,'' said
Gwynn, whose National League career has never once brought him to
the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Now, his first-ever game here will be Game 1 of the World
Series. And just to build the drama, Gwynn took the subway up from
Manhattan for Friday's workout. Gwynn got off the train, walked
right out to center field and into hallowed Monument Hall _ just to
give his inaugural visit a touch of the epic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really big,'' was how Gwynn described his first trip
inside big, white castle _ home of all the old Yankee legends and
ghosts, not to mention the current residence of the ubiquitous
owner, George Steinbrenner, and his $70 million band of American
League champs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to imagine what it was like when they were playing.
Babe Ruth and Joe DiMaggio and Lou Gehrig. But still, when you come
in by the train, you don't realize it's right in the
neighborhood,'' Gwynn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting off the subway, I was coming down the stairs thinking
there's a store right there and people are walking by it like it's
no big deal and I'm like: `There's Yankee Stadium.' And people are
looking at me like `What's the matter with him?'''
</P>
<P>
   Ballparks are not just ballparks. And all ball clubs are not
created equal. Tony Gwynn knows all of this.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and the Padres are as different as Big Apple and
California Sunkist oranges. More different, in fact. The Yankee
media guide says here that starting Saturday night, when Game 1
begins in the House That Ruth Built, the Bombers will be playing in
their 35th Fall Classic. They have won 23 times.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres, at last count, had appeared in all of one World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we got smoked,'' said Gwynn, whose first full season was
in 1984, when the Tigers ran all over the Padres _ a World Series
experience that bequethed not one shred of greatness to the Padre
franchise's ``legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing Gwynn remembers about '84, besides losing, is
Kirk Gibson standing on the field at Tiger Stadium, screaming at
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like, `This is Detroit! This is a real baseball field!'
I was like, `OK, I didn't even have anything to do with the first
two games,''' Gwynn said.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson and the Tigers went on to win three straight at Tiger
Stadium, whipping Gwynn and the Padres, who had no ammunition to
combat the ghosts and rabid fans of Tiger Stadium, not to mention
the fire-throwing arm of Tiger pitcher Jack Morris. Like the
114-win Yankees they meet Saturday night, the Tigers were the best
in baseball that year.
</P>
<P>
   The '84 ouster did nothing to alter the perception that the
Padres were a quirky Southern California team with the hideous
brown uniforms and absolutely no tradition, no history. Gwynn, the
eternal good humor man, can laugh at all the nonsense associated
with his team.
</P>
<P>
   Like how once, former Padres owner _ McDonald's baron Ray Kroc _
was so angry and humiliated after a four-error loss, Kroc got on
the public address system and offered a refund to fans who stayed
to watch the nine-inning disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, former general manager Buzzy Bavasi was caught
flipping the bird to fans after a game. Bavasi tried to deny it,
but TV cameras had caught Bavasi's bird in full glory.
</P>
<P>
   And Gwynn was there, standing on the steps of the dugout at Jack
Murphy Stadium, the night Roseanne Barr sang that twisted version
of the ``Star Spangled Banner.'' It was an act of patriotic
sacrilege so awful, so ridiculous, but so Padre-esque, even Gywnn
could not keep a straight face.
</P>
<P>
   As for team records? Postseason glory? World Series? On that
subject, Gwynn is a little more sanguine. Here at the Stadium, even
Gwynn understands the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we have five World Series games to our credit and Mickey
Mantle alone hit something like 18 postseason homers. Our history
is Kurt Bavecqua going to the plate, going deep and blowing kisses
to the crowd. That's what you're fighting against. Look at the
stuff associated with us. It's not positive,'' Gwynn said.
</P>
<P>
   But this time around, starting Saturday, Gwynn believes the
Padres can take an important step toward turning some heads and
altering perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   He will always have his own amazing successes _ his annual
flirtation with being baseball's next .400 hitter; his eight league
batting titles, 13 All-Star appearances and five Gold Gloves.
</P>
<P>
   But starting today, right in the heart of the Bronx, in the
belly of the beast of Yankee Stadium, Gwynn is looking for
something big to happen not to him, but his franchise, which has a
new ownership and a new demeanor and, possibly, a new waterfront
ballpark on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compare us on paper, we've got no chance,'' Gwynn said. ``But
in between the white lines, you never know. You can't get caught up
in the fact that you're here. They've been in 35 World Series.
We've been in two. But we're going to win. I realize who we're
playing and who we're going against and how difficult it's going to
be, but both sides want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, Mr. Padre seemed inspired by all these Yankee ghosts,
all this Yankee tradition dripping with history. Mr. Padre would
not mind if some of that old Mr. October magic rubbed off this
autumn.

FANTASY-FOOTBALL (Undated) - I bet this has happened to you. You're
sitting on the couch watching your favorite NFL game, waiting for
the scoreboard to scroll across the bottom of the screen. This
week, you took a chance and started Buffalo quarterback Rob
Johnson. Finally, it's halftime. After pointless yammering from
former NFL players _ all of whom have suffered several concussions
_ we reach the most crucial part of the halftime show: Bills-Colts
highlights. Then you see it - Doug Flutie is throwing a touchdown
pass for Buffalo. Expletive deleted. By BILL MULLER. Story will
move in the ``S'' category. &QL;

   MONIMALS (Scottsdale, Ariz.) - They're furry. They're
essentially useless. They're flying off the shelves at a pace that
could make them this year's pet rock. Scottsdale's Go-Video
introduces Monimals, furry costumes for your computer monitor with
a matching screen saver that converts your tube to a cow, sheep or
lion. They were one of the hits of last week's New York Internet
show. By JON SIDENER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BUDGET-AZ (Washington, D.C.) - At stake for Arizona in the
just-completed budget were whether states would get veto power over
new Indian casinos, and what identification immigrants would be
required to produce at the border. The official vote has been
postponed until Tuesday to review the foot-thick document. And
there were lots of significant unresolved issues heading into the
final days (i.e., water issues and park lands and various bills
pushed by members of the state's delegation). However, the outline
of what's in the budget for Arizona has been are well established.

THREE WINNERS FOR SOLIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Alex Solis rode three winners in a day for the
second time this week at Santa Anita Friday, and he completed his
latest triple by rallying Tomorrows Sunshine in the stretch of the
$72,000 Cascapedia.
</P>
<P>
   The victory in the 6 1/2-furlong test snapped a five-race
drought for Tomorrows Sunshine, which hadn't won since April.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has been a good horse until the last few races,'' said
Solis of the four-year-old filly, which has seven wins in 25
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Solis said the pre-race strategy devised by trainer John Sadler
was simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said `just ride her like you used to,' '' said Solis.
</P>
<P>
   That meant letting Tomorrows Sunshine drop off the pace and
``make one big move.''
</P>
<P>
   And Tomorrows Sunshine did just that, running fourth in the
five-horse field virtually the entire race.
</P>
<P>
   Second choice Fontal (2-1) and 6-5 favorite Career Collection
ran 1-2 most of the way, but Tomorrows Sunshine breezed by as
Fontal dropped to third and Career Collection faded to fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid of Fontal, I thought she might be the only
speed,'' said Solis. ``But I waited and waited and (when) thought I
had a chance to win, they were stopping.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrows Sunshine paid $9.00, 4.40 and 2.80. Fleeting Image
paid 5.20 and 2.80, and Fontal paid 2.40 to show.
</P>
<P>
   Solis' three wins moved him into a tie with with Laffit Pincay
Jr. for the Oak Tree riding lead (12 victories each) and he said
his stubbly beard might be here to stay a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to shave until 1999,'' joked Solis, who now has
2,998 career wins.

FURRY `MONIMALS' COSTUMES FOR COMPUTERS STAMPEDE OFF STORE
SHELVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN SIDENER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ They're furry. They're useless. And they're
stampeding off of store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale's Go-Video is marketing Monimals, furry costumes that
dress up a computer monitor as a cow, sheep, moose or lion. The
effect is enhanced by a screen saver that adds an animated face and
sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get some black and white fur with horns, a cow face
staring at you, chewing its cud,'' said Dan Halaburda, director of
sales/special markets for Go-Video. ``It's just a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   If a cud-chewing cow doesn't float your boat, try the antlered
moose with a shy streak, who runs off into the woods to hide behind
trees; or the cowardly lion who trembles before a mouse; or the
sheep who jump fences and might be therapeutic for insomniac
computer users.
</P>
<P>
   Monimals cost $24.95 for a 14-inch or 15-inch monitor, and
$26.95 for a 17-inch monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Go Video is the exclusive U.S. distributor for the ``funware''
product, which marks a departure from its core product line of
dual-deck VCRs.
</P>
<P>
   Monimals were dreamed up in London. The exclusive U.S.
dealership was offered to Go-Video through a mutual friend.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the early sales of Monimals have come from word-of-mouth
advertising, Halaburda said. The company introduced Monimals in
August, but has not yet begun a full-scale marketing campaign.
Go-Video displayed the product at last week's Fall Internet World
trade show in New York, where it was a crowd favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sales have been very good,'' Halaburda said. ``And we haven't
even begun to crank up the official PR machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Go-Video figured the furry computer accessory would sell well to
schools and parents. A silly face lift might make technology less
intimidating, they reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not where the hot sales have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's staggering the number of adults who are buying them for
themselves,'' Halaburda said. ``I never knew so many people out
there collected cows. And pigs are hot. We've got to come out with
a pig.''
</P>
<P>
   Go-Video is already looking at several possible expansions of
the Monimal line. Companies might want to add their logo to give
them to customers. And college and other sports mascots could add
many other potential characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of school mascots,'' Halaburda said. ``We
might have to come out with a Sparky the Sun Devil.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm has sold 20,000 of the fuzzy computer accessories to
date and officials are almost giddy over the prospect of having one
of the hot gifts of the Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope so,'' Halaburda said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope it's the next pet rock.'' &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Men, naked but for a diaper, writhing sensually like
Nijinsky on a bed of pink rose petals, are not what a fashion-show
audience comes to see. But few would be telling the truth if they
claimed that they minded this backdrop to the bounty of airy,
magical dresses and redoubtable slithery suits that were the John
Galliano collection.
</P>
<P>
   In several ways, Galliano and Karl Lagerfeld, whose spring 1999
collection for Chanel was shown Friday , have been successful
taking the best of history and reinterpreting it for modern utility
_ a skill matched perhaps only by Tom Ford at Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in fashion these days borrows. But what's remarkable
about these three designers is the way in which, like fashion
antiquarians, their vintage design references have been subsumed
into their own collections. Decades from now, when their work is
viewed with the benefit of hindsight, each will rightly be given
credit for his own considerable influence and recognizable imprint.
</P>
<P>
   For Galliano, fashion is a passport to dreams, to a time when
women put glamour and appearance above all and were adored for it.
Since everyone on occasion appreciates such escapism, Galliano's
viewpoint, however bacchanalian, is magnetic.
</P>
<P>
   Every model must live to be booked for one of Galliano's shows.
Working for him, they get a chance to perform instead of simply
being employed as a wooden clothes hangar. In Galliano's vision
last night of an operatic corps de ballet, circa 1920, the model
Shalom seemed to be playing her namesake, Salome. And who knew that
the model Crystelle could almost perform a full leg extension?
</P>
<P>
   But a ballet corp never got to dress like this _ in spectacular
dresses of flowing peach chiffon, with diamond-shaped insets and
cascades of accordion pleats. Some dresses were topped with
dangling bras trimmed with gold. Delicate black chiffon cascaded
over pale beige pleats that brushed the models' ankles.
</P>
<P>
   A beautiful evening dress of Chantilly lace hugged the waist and
then spread in a soft profusion to the floor. These were dresses so
pretty and feminine that even a bald, muscle-bound male model
(presumably the principal dancer in Galliano's fantasy) did justice
to a beautiful peach satin gown that he was wearing.
</P>
<P>
   Galliano's cast of styles included an orchestra member's fitted
jumper over a sweet sheer floral blouse; a doddering dowager's
sumptuous gold-threaded kimono opera coat and brocade suit, and an
actress in a gauzy Grecian-inspired long plum skirt and top wrapped
with deep pink velvet ribbon.
</P>
<P>
   Galliano is obviously an avid student of the designers Madeleine
Vionnet, Paul Poiret and Alix Gres, who each has left an indelible
imprimatur on style. Ms. Vionnet invented the bias cut, which
Galliano has reinstated. Poiret helped introduce women to freeing
clothes and was a master of the grand fashion gesture in, for
instance, the kimono coat. And Mme. Gres perfected the drapes and
cascades of Greek-like gowns.
</P>
<P>
   Lagerfeld, for his part, is an unapologetic champion of Coco
Chanel, who ushered in to dressing an ease and sport influence.
</P>
<P>
   But Lagerfeld is much more of a forward thinker than Galliano.
It was Chanel's sports legacy on which he chose to build the
collection this time, but in a totally surprising way. He brought a
streetwise sophistication to the line that might appeal equally to
traditional Chanel clients and to Monica, the 18-year-old singer
from Atlanta, whose two recent singles (one a duet with Brandy)
have catapulted to the top of the charts).
</P>
<P>
   This was not in the obvious spirit of the hip-hop or scuba
inspirations that Lagerfeld has done in the past to keep Chanel
current, but a more subtle take on the streety, sporty influence,
with tiny double C's almost indiscernible on the hems of tops and
shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Sports-influenced materials were evident in a youthful, Lycra
suit comprising briefs, a crop top and a cardigan jacket with
ridged seams. The same fabrics showed up in a black and ecru jacket
over a white paneled skirt, an orange leather jacket that fit snug
and sexy over relaxed silver trousers, and a luxurious but athletic
jacket in pale gray silk and cotton satin.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the fresh, sportier looks were from Chanel's new
Beige label, which fulfills Lagerfeld's wish to work with more
modern and sports-inspired materials. It should also broaden
Chanel's market.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the season for designers here has been about legacies,
their own or someone else's. Having broken fashion molds left and
right, Ann Demeulemeester is having trouble picking up the pieces.
Some fashion wags attributed Ms. Demeulemeester's inspiration for
her latest collection to Mother Teresa _ which may or may not be
the case. The designer's white cotton dresses and tops were
melodious examples of imagination and workmanship that are sure to
be commercialized and copied. Crushed white jackets paired with
loose pants and messenger bags with trouser loops looked smart and
funny.
</P>
<P>
   But too much in this collection, like her developing, twisted
T-shirts and drowning necklines, looked difficult and tortured. At
her best, Ms. Demeulemeester makes her most challenging design
ideas seem as easy as asking, ``Why didn't I think of that?''
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what comes to mind when viewing Martin
Margiela's avant-garde designs. The show was an encore of
Margiela's previous designs of photo-prints on dresses and T-shirts
that made it seem as if the wearer had put on, for instance, a
sequin slip dress over a white T-shirt. Margiela reprised from
seasons past his stockman's jacket and his apron skirts made from a
man's trousers, and he mixed in more commercial looks from his
secondary lines called 6 and 10. Few designers could be as
nostalgic and yet so interesting.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Issey Miyake, ever the experimenter, presented the most
intriguing idea of the French ready-to-wear shows with what he
called A-POC. The letters stand for A Piece of Cloth, which
consists of a tube of fabric with perforations that outline
garments that customers can cut out at home. On the runway, he
showed the method and the result: hats, bra tops, skirts, socks,
little pouch bags from this strange but feasible concept.
</P>
<P>
   Both Miyake and Margiela are regarded as messianic by the
avant-garde crowd, holding the cause aloft despite the considerable
downward tug exerted by lesser designers like Kostas Murkudis, A.F.
Vandevorst, Atsuro Tayama.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Murkudis did not show great style in his funky skirts
decorated with hidden zippers that can be worn open _ to reveal
whatever you like _ and delightful tulle dresses covered with bands
of ribbon and zips, and sheer parachute suits. But they were quite
conservative for a man who just a year ago was showing a bib as a
piece of clothing. Murkudis clearly decided he wanted to sell some
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Tayama and Ms. Vandevorst seem to be pushing
themselves a bit hard, taking the recent medical-inspired trend in
fashion too literally, with clothes reminiscent of straitjackets
and nurses' uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vandervorst, as her name suggests, is from Belgium, not
France. Neither are Tayama, Murkudis, Lagerfeld and Galliano
Frenchmen. They are all part of the quiet revolution transforming
the Paris ready-to-wear shows. With only one to four French
designers among the 10 to 14 designers who show on a typical day
here, the Chambre Syndicale du Pret-a-) Porter des Couturiers et
des Createurs de Mode, the French fashion trade group, finds itself
in the strange position of promoting a great deal of foreign
talent.
</P>
<P>
   To counteract this slide in probably the only country where the
plebiscite takes the art of fashion as seriously as the elite do,
the Chambre this season underwrote 17 designer shows, many of them
French, instead of the usual two. There are also plans to create a
Cite de la Mode in Paris in 2000 to bring together the various
fashion schools in one location and to strengthen French fashion
business development and research, said Didier Grumbach, the
president of the federation of French ready-to-wear and couture
designers.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, foreigners seem to understand better the
imperative to release French clothes from their stuffiness. A
Spaniard, Cristina Ortiz, has brought a modern spirit to the French
house of Lanvin, and Alber Elbaz, an American, has done the same
with Guy Laroche.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ortiz invoked a cold, austere beauty with frosty blues and
whites in sculptured, space-age jackets and furled skirts brushing
the ground. Even trousers had puffed hems. It was distinctive but
stopped short of being thoroughly appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Elbaz, in his last collection for Guy Laroche, designed pretty
dresses with etched florals, a wool flower nestled in a drape at
the back of a skirt, and long gray wool skirts gently slung over
rippling blouses. For all his references to flowers, Elbaz managed
to make his collection somehow somber. Missing were the inspired
hues and combinations of colors and the French flavor of reveling
in dressing up.
</P>
<P>
   It will surely all burst forth again next season when Elbaz
leaves the house of Laroche for the even more essentially French
house of Yves Saint Laurent. &QL;

<P>
   LONDON _ The 1998 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded Friday to John
Hume and David Trimble, leaders of the largest Catholic and
Protestant political parties in Northern Ireland, for their efforts
to bring peace to the long-polarized British province.
</P>
<P>
   Hume, 61, the Catholic head of the Social Democratic and Labor
Party, was cited by the Nobel Committee in Oslo for having been
``the clearest and most consistent of Northern Ireland's political
leaders in his work for a peaceful solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, 54, the Protestant leader of the Ulster Unionists, was
honored for having demonstrated ``great political courage when, at
a critical stage in the process, he advocated solutions which led
to the peace agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   A leader of a third prominent party, Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein,
the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, was not named as a
prize winner. Nor were several other figures mentioned as
possibilities, including former Sen. George Mitchell, who led the
talks, Prime Ministers Tony Blair of Britain and Bertie Ahern of
Ireland, President Clinton, and Mo Mowlam, the British government's
secretary for Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The accord, signed on April 10 and known as the Good Friday
Agreement, has given the 1.7 million residents of Northern Ireland
a respite from the sectarian violence that has claimed more than
3,200 lives in the last 30 years. It has also opened the
possibility of lasting stability for the first time since the
establishment of Northern Ireland with partition from Ireland in
1921.
</P>
<P>
   Forging concessions from fiercely antagonistic populations, the
accord seeks to balance the Protestant majority's wish to remain
part of Britain with Catholic desires to strengthen ties to the
Irish Republic to the south.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, seeing in Northern Ireland's two warring groups a
dispute with notable similarities to violent tribal confrontations
elsewhere, expressed the hope that the accord would serve ``to
inspire peaceful solutions to other religious, ethnic and national
conflicts around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   While it did not honor Adams, the committee said it wished to
``emphasize the importance of the positive contributions to the
peace process made by other Northern Irish leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the prize givers had ``shied away'' from Adams because
of his past association with violence, the chairman of the
secretive five-man committee, Francis Sejersted, said: ``We don't
shy away from anybody. We just try to pick the most worthy
people.'' Adams, he said, was ``clearly one of those who has
contributed significantly to the process so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams was almost certainly on the list of 139 nominees because
the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee Friday implied
strongly that it had considered him for the prize but decided to
limit it to Hume and Trimble.
</P>
<P>
   The two men will share the prize money of $960,000.
</P>
<P>
   Nominations can be made by university professors, members of
national legislatures, former Nobel laureates, members of the Nobel
Committee and a number of other people considered qualified. The
committee itself releases the number of nominations but does not
identify the nominees or or even confirm a name.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the Nobel Committee included Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, as a prize winner with the Israeli leaders
Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres. One committee member, Kaare
Kristiansen, resigned in protest, calling Arafat ``a terrorist.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why the committee selected the two men from the
number of people associated with the Good Friday Agreement,
Sejersted said, ``There is one from the Catholic side and one from
the Protestant side, so I do not fear that it is going to alienate
any of the other parties in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams, in New York on a fund-raising trip for Sinn Fein,
welcomed the Oslo announcement and particularly praised Hume, who
is widely seen as having helped persuade the IRA to adopt a
cease-fire and having eased Sinn Fein's entry into the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, there would be no peace process but for his courage
and vision,'' Adams said, adding, `No one deserves this accolade
more.'' He also said the prize imposed on everyone the
responsibility to ``push ahead through the speedy implementation of
the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The immediate next steps are the creation in the new
power-sharing Northern Ireland Assembly of a 10-member executive
that will in effect be the new government of the province, and a
cross-border body linking the North with the Irish Republic, one of
the key attractions in the pact to the Catholic minority.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, who is the first minister of the new legislature, faces
pressure from dissidents in his quarrelsome party who insist that
the IRA must start disarming before Sinn Fein can take up the
positions in the Assembly that its vote total in June elections
entitles it to.
</P>
<P>
   In the unforgiving politics of Northern Ireland, the Unionist
dissidents and members of other Protestant parties who did not join
in the peace talks attacked both Trimble and Hume Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Paisley Jr., son of the head of the Democratic Unionist
Party, called the Nobel Committee's decision a ``farce'' and said
of the winners, ``These people have not delivered peace, and they
are not peacemakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimble said Friday that he was ``slightly uncomfortable'' with
the award because so many other people had been involved beside him
in reaching the settlement and much remained to be done to put it
in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that while we have the makings of peace, it is not
wholly secure yet,'' he told the BBC from Denver, where he was on
an 11-city North American mission to spur foreign investment in
Ulster. ``I hope it does not turn out to be premature.''
</P>
<P>
   Hume received word of the prize at his home in Londonderry and
termed it ``an expression of the total endorsement of the work of
very many people.'' He added: ``This isn't just an award to David
Trimble and myself. It is an award to all the people in Northern
Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday was the second time the Nobel Peace Prize has gone to
figures in the Northern Ireland conflict. Betty Williams and
Mairead Corrigan, two Belfast women, won it in 1976 for mobilizing
Catholics and Protestants to stage rallies calling for an end to
violence. They acted after three children of Miss Corrigan's sister
were killed when they were struck by an IRA gunman's getaway car.

TWO RIVALS TO MEET TODAY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Chris McCarron doesn't know why Free House ran
a poor fourth behind Skip Away in the Woodward Stakes at Belmont
Park last month. The jockey only knows the colt must do better to
compete with old rival Silver Charm in the $500,000 Goodwood
Handicap at Santa Anita today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been training so well, I'm just going to throw that race
out of my mind and ride him with a lot of confidence,'' McCarron
said.
</P>
<P>
   Free House, an impressive winner of the Pacific Classic at Del
Mar in his previous start, finished nearly 17 lengths behind Skip
Away in the Woodward. A postrace examination showed no sign of
pulmonary bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   McCarron said he was skeptical of speculation that Free House
suffered from a displaced palate, interfering with his breathing.
But the 4-year-old will be fitted today with a tongue tie, the
common remedy for that problem.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm, to be ridden by Gary Stevens, and Free House will
each carry 124 pounds in the 1[-mile Goodwood. Their four
opponents, assigned from nine to 14 pounds less, include recent
Pomona Invitational winner Score Quick.
</P>
<P>
   The favorites met six times during the 1997 Triple Crown season.
Silver Charm won the San Vicente Stakes, Kentucky Derby and
Preakness. Free House won the San Felipe and Santa Anita Derby.
Silver Charm ran second and Free House third in the Belmont Stakes,
which was won by Touch Gold.

 LONDON: getaway car. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There had been strong speculation that the committee would
recognize the Ulster peace effort this year, and other names
figured in the conjecture. There were the two prime ministers,
Blair of Britain and Ahern of Ireland, who drove the faltering
talks to a conclusion and stayed up all night with the negotiators
as the deadline slipped from midnight April 9 into the next
afternoon. And in addition to Mitchell and Ms. Mowlam, there was
Clinton, who actively pressed the two sides to get together and
made critical phone calls to negotiators at Blair's request in the
final hours.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington Friday, Clinton said ``how very pleased'' he was,
``personally and as president, that the Nobel Prize Committee has
rewarded the courage and the people of Northern Ireland by giving
the Nobel Peace Prize to John Hume and to David Trimble.'' He added
``a special word of thanks'' to Mitchell, who issued a statement
praising Hume and Trimble as ``fully deserving of this honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Hume, nominated for the Peace Prize twice before, is widely
credited with being the single most important and consistent
influence for peace in Northern Ireland. For 30 years he has been
speaking out against violence, as a member of a short-lived
Northern Ireland assembly in the early 1970s and then as a member
of the British Parliament and the European Parliament. He has made
frequent trips to the United States to encourage investment in
Ulster and to dissuade Irish-Americans from furnishing money for
the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Once a trainee priest and then a teacher, he became involved in
politics when the Catholic civil rights movement started in 1968.
He was a founder of his party in 1970 to represent ``nationalist''
sentiment. In Northern Ireland, a nationalist is someone wanting
closer ties and even union with Ireland but, unlike republicans,
unwilling to countenance bloodshed to reach the goal. On the
Protestant side, the two counterpart words are ``unionist,'' like
Trimble, and ``loyalist,'' the term for Protestant paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Hume began the process that led to April's settlement five years
ago, with a decision to meet secretly with Adams, an outcast among
nationalists because of his identification with the IRA. Those
talks led to a cease-fire in 1993 that prompted hopes for an end to
the violence. Those hopes were dashed 17 months later when the IRA
set off a bomb in the Canary Wharf financial district of London.
</P>
<P>
   Though he said he was devastated by the act, Hume pressed on,
and his efforts produced a second cease-fire and brought Adams to
the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, by contrast, is a late-comer to accommodation with his
opponents. A former law professor, he began his political life as
an enemy of the party he now leads and an agitator against the last
peace settlement, the Sunningdale Agreement, which died in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the hard-line ``vanguard'' movement at that time,
he said, ``I would personally draw the line at violence and
terrorism, but if we are talking about a campaign that involves
demonstrations and so on, then a certain amount of violence may be
inescapable.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Trimble, already a member of the British Parliament,
attracted much attention by leading Orange Order Protestant
marchers at Drumcree Church into a police formation set up to block
their path down an avenue in a Catholic neighborhood. When the
parade successfully reached the Orange Lodge hall in downtown
Portadown, he danced a jig of triumph with the Rev. Ian Paisley,
the fulminating preacher-politician with a history of
fire-breathing speeches condemning Catholic advances.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Trimble for party leader over a more moderate
official that same year was seen as a sign that the unionists were
digging in their heels and selecting their most combatively
conservative candidate.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Paisley, the reigning symbol of Protestant
intransigence, calls Trimble a traitor to the unionist cause. What
has brought Trimble into disrepute with some former allies and at
the same time made him a credible candidate for a Nobel Peace Prize
was his stance in the last year trying to persuade his party, whose
slogan has always been ``No Surrender,'' that the time had come for
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   This fall he met with Adams, an unthinkable act for a unionist
politician until now and one for which he was pilloried by
dissidents in his party. He now travels the province with Seamus
Mallon, the deputy speaker and a Catholic, by his side in an
expression of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has taken a political chance in identifying himself with
the process,'' Sejersted, the Nobel Committee chairman, said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The peace talks began in the summer of 1996, held in drab civil
service buildings behind the stately Stormont building in Belfast
where the new legislature created by the settlement is now meeting.
The negotiations eventually drew the participation of eight of the
10 Northern Irish parties, with many of the men around the table
convicted murderers and bombers who had emerged from prison with a
commitment to peaceful resolution to what for nearly a century have
been referred to wearily as ``the Troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   The paramilitary groups had also made the tactical decision that
violence would not secure their goals, a shared conviction that
gave these talks a chance for success that past fitful attempts at
settlement lacked.
</P>
<P>
   The peace talks moved in a desultory manner until Blair took
office in May 1997 and highlighted the cause of peace in Northern
Ireland as an early commitment. At his and Ahern's urging, the IRA
declared a cease-fire in July, and by September Sinn Fein was
permitted to join the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Blair also gave Trimble and Adams unprecedented access to 10
Downing Street, and the Ulster Protestants reported that they
obtained from Clinton the most sympathetic hearing they had ever
had from an American president, allaying their longtime suspicions
of Washington's bias in favor of the Catholic minority.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Friday from his Chequers retreat hailing the
participants in the Northern Irish settlement, Blair said the
lesson that Friday's awards taught was that ``political leaders
have to get out of their political boxes they have been in for
years and years and take risks for peace.''

POSTSEASON-STARVED L.A. FANS JUMP ON PADRES BANDWAGON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- World Series fever has hit L.A. Never mind that
the October Classic will be played in -- shudder -- San Diego and
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak is considering adding extra coaches to accommodate all
the fans who want to ride the 10 daily San Diegan trains to the
coastal city to the south.
</P>
<P>
   Professional ticket brokers can't answer the phones fast enough
to field calls from fans hungry to see championship-caliber
baseball. And amateurs like Tony Gold of suburban Sherman Oaks are
cashing in on the act, hoping to sell tickets they bought earlier
this week for as much as $400 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Gold usually answers his phone with a simple ``Hello,'' but
Friday it was all business: ``World Series hotline!''
</P>
<P>
   Gold gathered credit cards from his mother and a friend, set his
phone on speed-dial and ended up with 54 tickets. On Friday he
turned his apartment into a sales shop to resell the ducats.
Hopefuls called all day, willing to beg, borrow or barter their way
to one of his precious tickets.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the prices were relatively cheap. Scalpers in New
York were asking $2,500, though authorities said they will
prosecute all scalpers.
</P>
<P>
   Gold, an aspiring actor, said some of the offers he heard were
better than money.
</P>
<P>
   ``One said she'd set me up in the Playboy mansion for two
nights. Another offered me two days and three nights on his
yacht,'' he said. ``You've got the Padres and the Angels and the
Dodgers. When's the last time one of them has been in the World
Series?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's supply and demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Los Angeles Dodgers have the pieces of a contender,
but year after year they can't make them fit together to win a
National League pennant. The Anaheim Angels this season again came
oh-so-close to the American League playoffs before swooning in
September.
</P>
<P>
   So the Series hasn't graced a professional baseball diamond in
Southern California since 1988, when the Dodgers beat the Oakland
Athletics in five games.
</P>
<P>
   In the decade since the Dodgers last won the series, their star
hitter Kirk Gibson has become a broadcaster in Detroit, their star
pitcher Orel Hershiser moved on to pitch for the archrival San
Francisco Giants, and fans have become increasingly pessimistic
about the prospect of future championships ever coming back to
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we're going to have another World Series in
Southern California any time soon,'' said Ron Epstein, a suburban
Woodland Hills resident and Dodgers fan who plans to drive to San
Diego for Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   After the Series opens with games in New York today and Sunday,
it moves to San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Game 5 will be played there Friday if one team doesn't sweep. After
that, the Series will shift back to New York.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Chamber of Commerce, which estimates that region
could make $100 million from three games in the area, is welcoming
disgruntled Los Angeles fans with open arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as we clinched, the phones started ringing,'' said Sue
Mason, a San Diego Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau manager. ``Our
indication is that most of them are coming from Los Angeles and
Orange County, with calls from Arizona and New York as well.''
</P>
<P>
   While hotel rooms throughout San Diego were still available
Friday, conventions previously scheduled for next week have already
sucked up empty beds, said Chamber of Commerce research manager
Kelly Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   ``October is already a busy time for us,'' Cunningham said.
``Accommodations are going to be very tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles residents with tickets are planning to leave as
early as 9 a.m., anticipating six hours in traffic for what should
be a two-hour drive.
</P>
<P>
   It's only three hours on the train, though they have been
getting fuller.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Padres do have a strong base in Los Angeles because the
teams there haven't been so great lately,'' Amtrak spokesman
Dominic Albano said. ``We've seen ridership increases as the Padres
have kept doing better and made their way though the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Local ticket brokers were advertising World Series ticket sales
in enormous classified-ad headlines, with the Pac-10 showdown
between UCLA and Oregon and the Kiss concert on Halloween -- events
actually taking place in Los Angeles -- getting second billing.
</P>
<P>
   One busy operator at VIP Tickets put it best Friday morning:
``We're swamped, absolutely swamped.''
</P>
<P>
   Gold took 55 calls in three hours -- 45 of them from Yankees
fans. Gold is a Padres fan, but he'll be saving a ticket each day
for himself so he can root for New York ace David Wells -- they
played Little League together a hop up the coast from San Diego in
Oceanside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really special to be able to see him live,'' Gold added,
``and even make a little profit off it.''

<P>
   CASPER, Wyo. _ Matthew Wayne Shepard, the gay student who was
beaten in the dead of night, tied to a fence and left to die alone,
was mourned at his funeral Friday by 1,000 people, including many
who had never met him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt believed that if he had made one person's life better, he
had succeeded,'' his cousin, the Rev. Anne Kitch, said in a homily
that was carried beyond the packed pews of St. Mark's Episcopal
Church, through a filled parish hall, across the street to a packed
Presbyterian church and across Casper on an AM radio station.
``Judging from the world's response,'' she said, ``Matt will have
made a difference in the lives of thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   As the first snowstorm of the fall blanketed Casper, fresh
flowers filled the red brick church here where Shepard had been
baptized as a teen-ager and where he once wore the white robes of
an Episcopal acolyte.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an image that comes to mind when I reflect on Matt on
that wooden cross rail fence,'' said the Rev. Royce Brown, the
pastor of St. Mark's, in a eulogy. ``I replace that image with that
of another man hung upon a cross. When I concentrate on that man, I
can release the bitterness inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard, a 21-year-old freshman at the University of Wyoming,
had dreamed of working one day for human rights. In death, he has
become a national catalyst for a new drive to guarantee for gay
people the right to physical safety.
</P>
<P>
   His death hit a nerve in the nation this week, eliciting dozens
of candlelight vigils and rallies for tolerance, several statements
of sadness from President Clinton, and a congressional resolution.
Thursday, the House of Representatives passed by voice vote a
resolution that condemned Shepard's killing as ``outrageous'' and
that urged each member of Congress and every U.S. citizen ``to
denounce this outrageous murder of another human being.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the largest rallies, about 1,000 people, including
members of Congress of both parties, gathered on the steps of the
Capitol in Washington to condemn Shepherd's killing and to urge
passage of a federal bill that would add extra penalties to crimes
motivated by a victim's sexual orientation, gender or disability.
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt urged passage of the bill,
leading the crowd in a chant of ``Now! Now! Now.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We will never forget the love that the world has shared with
this kind, loving son,'' said Shepherd's father, Dennis, his
father, outside Casper City Hall, as his mother, Judy, stood by,
weeping. He said the family was ``touched beyond measure'' by ``the
thousands of e-mail comments, Web-site messages, phone calls and
cards offering help, consolation, sympathy and support.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the funeral, about a dozen protesters, largely from
Kansas and Texas, waved signs with anti-homosexual messages. But
mourners stood in front of them, singing ``Amazing Grace'' and
holding umbrellas to block the sight of the spectacle from friends
and family members entering the church.
</P>
<P>
   On hearing of the protest, the Casper City Council held an
emergency meeting Thursday night and unanimously passed an
ordinance banning protests during funerals.
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming Gov. Jim Geringer had warned in advance that anti-gay
protesters were ``just flat not welcome.'' The governor, a
Republican, added, ``What we don't need is a bunch of wingnuts
coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard was born in Casper and attended elementary school,
junior high and several years of high school and college here. With
flags at Casper's public schools flying at half-staff Friday, many
mourners were his old classmates. Others traveled here, one driving
from as far away as New Jersey, out of a sense of solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a pit in my heart and my stomach since I heard
this,'' said Steve Pietrangelo, who drove 300 miles to wait three
hours in cold rain and snow to attend the funeral of a man he never
met. ``I just wanted to pay my respects to him and his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Touching people of all walks of life, Shepard's murder has
elicited calls for tolerance of homosexuals from unexpected
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Wyoming this fall, football players will
wear yellow and green stickers on their helmets in memory of
Shepard. Organizers said that yellow signifies tolerance and green
symbolizes peace. In Casper, a conservative city of 51,000, located
in the heart of Wyoming's oil belt, tolerance has become the
watchword.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prejudice against homosexuals is just as redneck as anti-black
bias,'` The Casper Star-Tribune, Wyoming's largest newspaper, wrote
in its main editorial on Sunday. ``Violence against our homosexual
friends and neighbors has created a most un-American climate of
fear in Wyoming and the rest of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Jason Marsden, the newspaper's political reporter, wrote
lovingly that, ``Matthew Shepard is still my friend, and not just
because we are both members of the loose-knit community of gay
people striving to make our way in this sometimes hostile place
called Wyoming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt was very short and hard to hug,'' Marsden recalled of the
young man who had grown up in Casper. ``But it was worth trying,
because he'd hug you with everything in his little, fragile
frame.''
</P>
<P>
   In a week of spiritual reflection, Aaron Kreifels, the
University of Wyoming freshman who found his battered classmate
Oct. 7, attributed the chance discovery to ``God's plan.''
</P>
<P>
   On that afternoon, Kreifels, an 18-year-old architectural
engineering student, had nearly completed a rigorous six-mile ride
on a mountain bike up and down Cactus Canyon, in public lands east
of Laramie.
</P>
<P>
   Kreifels recalled in an interview Thursday his only mishap of
the ride, ``I hit this big limestone rock and did one over the
handlebars.''
</P>
<P>
   Dusting himself off and looking around in the fading light of
the day, Kreifels recalled, ``I noticed something out of my eye
that looked like a scarecrow. I walked around the fence, and as I
got closer, I noticed the hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard, his hands bound behind his back with a nylon cord and
tied to a fence post, was lying on the ground, face up,
unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I wonder why I found him alive, if he was going to
die,'' Kreifels reflected, before traveling to spend this weekend
at home with his parents in Grand Island, Neb. ``But I guess God
wanted his parents to be with him.''

ROSE BOWL BRACES FOR SHOOTOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Two months ago, it sounded silly. Now, not so
silly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to one of my friends on Oregon (tailback Derien
Latimer),'' UCLA quarterback Cade McNown recalled. ``And he said at
the beginning of the season, `We're going to win the national
championship.' I thought, `Wow, they have high ambitions.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But so far, he's on the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, No. 11 Oregon is one of the nation's biggest surprises
entering today's showdown against No. 2 UCLA at the Rose Bowl,
where the teams might score as many points in 60 minutes as some
score in an entire season. Combined, they're averaging 98.6 per
game _ and there's nothing normal about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be scoreless,'' said Washington State coach Mike
Price, who's faced both teams this season.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will there be a shortage of individual talent, especially in
green and yellow. Oregon quarterback Akili Smith leads the nation
in passing and might be the best athlete UCLA faces all season.
Ducks tailback Reuben Droughns leads the Pac-10 in rushing and has
with three 200-yard games. The receivers, Damon Griffin and Tony
Hartley, average eight catches and 160 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks have smashed all comers _ home and road, conference
and nonconference _ and done so more impressively than UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave the game to UCLA,'' Price said of a 49-17 loss two
weeks ago, in which the Cougars committed four turnovers. ``We
didn't to Oregon. The Ducks can score on anybody and they'll score
on UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   The flaw in Price's argument is competition. Whereas UCLA proved
its worth last week at Arizona, the Ducks have faced a slew of
stiffs _ including Stanford, San Jose State, Texas-El Paso and
Michigan State. Oregon has also been unable to stop the run,
allowing 154.5 yards per game, seventh in the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   Either the Ducks can't stop the run or they were so far ahead
they didn't try. The answer comes today.
</P>
<P>
   The plot figures to follow one of two courses. Perhaps it'll be
the shootout most expect _ a last-possession-wins circus, 52-48,
45-42, something like that.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps the defenses will make a surprise appearance, keep
the score in the 30s and let turnovers decide.
</P>
<P>
   For those expecting 100 points, consider the relationships
involved: UCLA coach Bob Toledo was Oregon's offensive coordinator
from 1983-88, and Bruins playcaller Al Borges held the same post
with Oregon in 1995. UCLA defensive coordinator Nick Aliotti was
just that with the Ducks from 1988-94; he remains extremely close
to Oregon head coach Mike Bellotti and attended UC Davis with
several Ducks coaches.
</P>
<P>
   What it means is this: The offensive systems are almost
identical. What the defenses face today, they face each day in
practice. Fewer adjustments are required. Recognition _ of
formations, blocking schemes and pass patterns _ is high. Some of
the plays are !ital!exactly!off! the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot like what we do here,'' Aliotti said. ``That can't
hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   What of the respective psyches? Can UCLA recreate the emotion it
used in Tucson? Last Friday night's meeting, which ended in tears
and a group hug, is not easily repeated. Hoping to grab his
players' attention, Toledo gave a brief history lesson after
practice Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mention the 1988 team (ranked No.1), which was ahead of
Washington State 28-3 at halftime and lost 31-28 because it didn't
play four quarters,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have played in games of this magnitude, both last
year and this. More, they've been behind and kept their poise,
trailing Arizona four times before breaking the game open in the
fourth quarter. But the Ducks have done neither. This is their
first game on grass and their first game in the glare of postseason
importance since the 1994 Rose Bowl run.
</P>
<P>
   The sky-high Smith has had trouble sleeping this week, so
excited is he about duelling McNown. Droughns, from Anaheim, and
Griffin, from Monrovia, have craved the chance to perform with
friends and families in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing paralyzes a team like sensory overload. And what if the
Ducks fall behind?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players are hungry to gain respect,'' Bellotti said.
``We'll have plenty of emotion involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe too much.
</P>

AFTER BUDGET DEAL, IT'S TIME TO WRITE THE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (subs to recast story, primarily in its first half; also some new
details)  
 (ATTN: Ind., Miss., Ohio, La., Texas, Ga.)  (See also CONGRESS-PORN, CONGRESS-CLINTON, CONGRESS-SURPLUS) 
(bl) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A day after celebrating a much-delayed agreement on
a final federal budget package, Congress did not have a budget bill
in place to vote on and postponed Friday's planned action on the
$500 billion deal until next week.
</P>
<P>
   With just 17 days until the midterm elections, most lawmakers
fled the capital for their campaigns at home, with some of them
grousing about excessive spending, numerous details still
unresolved and much of the bill still unwritten.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservatives, mainly in the House, were upset with some of
the bill's major provisions, like the use of part of the surplus
for a $20 billion supplemental package for so-called emergencies
like extra military spending and solving the Year 2000 computer
problem, and with the absence of a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Congress cannot vote on the budget until the bill's final
language is drafted, which no one has had time to do since
top-level negotiators agreed Thursday afternoon on the broad
outlines. The vote, which was expected Friday, was put off and, for
the fifth time since the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year, Congress
had to arrange more temporary financing to keep the government
running.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of top-level bargainers _ including House Speaker
Newt Gingrich, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and White House
chief of staff Erskine Bowles _ were in the room for the final
deal. Excluded were the committee chairmen and the heads of the
appropriation committees, who are now trying to write the precise
language of the bill, which could run more than 3,000 pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a bunch of free-thinkers in the room,'' said one
top congressional aide.
</P>
<P>
   The details that remained to be nailed down, and written, ranged
from precisely how to spend $6 billion in aid to farmers to how to
respond to people with an allergy to peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich and other members from Georgia, a major
peanut-producing state, are trying to block a Transportation
Department regulation that would force airlines to create a
``peanut-free'' zone to protect passengers with allergies. The
regulation would prevent peanuts from being served within three
rows of such passengers on domestic flights.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has nothing to do with federal spending, but the
spending bill is the last opportunity in this session of Congress
for members to have their special provisions addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked into the budget agreement is a measure that would
restrict children's access to pornography on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The lag time before the bill is officially closed is making some
conservatives nervous that more members will try to add provisions
that will further expand a bill they already consider overly
bloated, and that few will have time to read. And some worry that
once the hometown pork that is stuffed into the bill is publicly
revealed, voters could put pressure on their elected
representatives not to support it.
</P>
<P>
   To stay within its spending limits for a balanced budget,
Congress or the president can designate something an emergency
without having to pay for it by cutting from other programs. That
means, in effect, that they would be using money from this year's
anticipated $70 billion surplus to pay for such so-called
emergencies, which may or may not meet the definition of a one-time
unforeseen disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives, who are concerned chiefly about busting the
budget, questioned the agreement to use the surplus for the
president's $10 billion for ``emergencies'' like dealing with the
computer bug and the Republicans' $9 billion, much of it for
military hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, virtually everyone on Capitol Hill expected the
budget to pass _ eventually.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., said: `Most of my friends, who are
predominantly activist conservatives, are split about 50-50. If tax
cuts were your primary thing, then you're unhappy, but many
conservatives have a mixed agenda. My position is, hold the nose
and vote yes. We have no tax cuts and far too much spending that I
oppose, but that's the nature of compromise. Every member has a
little different focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Souder said he liked the extra money for defense spending, and
he liked the price supports for farmers. Hog farmers in his
district, whose biggest customers were Japan and China, had been
hit hard by the collapse of Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans said the bill seemed skewed in favor of the
Democrats. They cited two reasons: Clinton needed to curry favor
with Democrats to shore up support if the House votes to impeach
him, and Republican leaders feared that if they had stood up to
Clinton, they might have forced a government shutdown and
Republicans would be blamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton was buying votes,'' said Rep. David Hobson, R-Ohio.
``He was sucking up to the liberal Democrats so they would support
him in impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin, R-La., said the leaders seemed
motivated by a desire to avoid the political damage they incurred
from the partial government shutdowns of 1995 and 1996. He also
cited the president's need to placate the left by adding costly
domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of the lessons learned three years ago and the
scandal on the president's side yielded the inevitable result, a
budget that leans way to the left,'' Tauzin said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said he would probably support the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be enthusiastically,'' he said. ``I think we would
have gotten a tax cut, but for the scandal. If the president had
not been caught up with the scandal, he probably would have
followed the Dick Morris strategy and moved towards the center.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said he recognized that some conservatives were wary of
the agreement. But he sought to reassure them that the package
served their interests.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the increase in defense spending. And he noted that the
Republicans had blocked several items, including needle-exchange
programs in the District of Columbia, national education testing
and U.S. contributions to a United Nations program that pays for
family planning in China, which many in Congress object to because
China has a policy of coercing abortions and forcing sterilization.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said the agreement was the best that could be achieved
``when you have a conservative Republican Congress and a liberal
Democratic President.''
</P>
<P>
   A few remained outright hostile to the bill, as much for the
hasty way in which it was cobbled together as for what it
contained.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, said: `I'm voting no unless something
revolutionary happens between now and Tuesday. I think it's the
process that gives the president the ability to stonewall until the
very end and then hold us for ransom. The Republican leadership in
the House and Senate did a good job of limiting the highway
robbery, but it's still gone too far beyond the spending caps.''
</P>
<P>
   Also angry at the rushed endgame was Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Miss.,
who took to the House floor and said he could not support the final
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to urge my colleagues to vote no,'' Taylor said.
``We have stayed here this long. We can stay a little bit longer.
And I am going to encourage my colleagues to continue to vote no
until we are given adequate time to study the measure that is
brought before us, and then and only then should we be making a
decision for over hundreds of billions of dollars worth of
programs.''

Don't dismiss Padres in New York minute
<TEXT>
<P>
   By FRAN BLINEBURY &QL; 
Houston Chronicle &QL; 
NEW YORK _ So much for low-key.
</P>
<P>
   David Wells said it probably would take the Yankees five games
to finish off the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   He said it less than defiantly. ``Oooh, five,'' was Wells'
response the other morning when prodded for a prediction on the
nationally syndicated Howard Stern radio show.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Stern is as neat a fit with baseball as George Will
with the Crips or the Bloods. So other than the blaring front-page
headlines of New York tabloids, nobody gave it much thought.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre shrugs. That's Boomer.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees center fielder Bernie Williams shrugs. That's Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees fans from the Bowery to the Bronx shrug. That's Wells.
</P>
<P>
   With Game 1 of the World Series tonight, a great deal of
shrugging is going on in the Big Apple. Most of it in the direction
of the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   After all, San Diego is not the team (Braves) that compiled the
best record in the National League this season and is not even the
team (Astros) with the better record in its NL Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   What the Padres do not have is a supposed Hall of Fame pitching
staff and a self-proclaimed pedigree as the ``Team of the '90s,''
like Atlanta. What the Padres do not have is a monster everyday
lineup with a bunch of .300 hitters and 100-run producers, like the
Astros.
</P>
<P>
   What the Padres do have is one thing: A chance. No more, no
less.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a fitting climax
</P>
<P>
   After two rounds of the American League playoffs, where they
were barely challenged by the Rangers and Indians, this is at least
a change and gives us hope the 94th World Series can live up to all
of the wonderful events in the magical season that preceded it.
</P>
<P>
   There was the gripping summer of the home-run chase with Mark
McGwire and Sammy Sosa crashing past Roger Maris and history. There
was the voluntary end to Cal Ripken Jr.'s consecutive-games streak
at 2,632. There was a rookie fireballer named Kerry Wood blazing
onto the scene with a record-tying 20 strikeouts in a game against
the Astros. And there was, at long last, a figurative hug, an
embrace by American fans of the grand old game after years of
bitterness that followed the last baseball strike.
</P>
<P>
   What the game needs to top off a dream season is a World Series
that lives up to the hype as the Fall Classic and, strange as it
might sound, by pitting the storied Yankees and tradition-barren
Padres, this could be it.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. If it had been a New York-Atlanta series, the
two teams that have won one World Series title each in this decade
could have decided once and for all which is the true ``Team of the
'90s.'' But a matchup between the deep pockets of George
Steinbrenner vs. the deep pockets of Ted Turner also would have
reinforced the notion that championships are for sale only to the
highest bidder with the highest, most star-studded profiles.
</P>
<P>
   Now here come the Padres, out of the bottom left corner of the
map, with a collection of grizzled, scrappy veteran hitters, an ace
in Kevin Brown and the unlikeliest of NLCS MVP's in Sterling
Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   Three flukes and you're champs
</P>
<P>
   Was it just a fluke the 98-win Padres beat the 102-win Astros?
Was it another fluke they also beat the 106-win Braves? Well, if
that's the case, then who says flukes can't come in threes with the
114-win Yankees next?
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees should win. They probably will. But it would not be
wise to dismiss a team that is full of momentum and confidence and
has beaten Randy Johnson (twice), Tom Glavine (twice) and Greg
Maddux to get here.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Yankees' previous playoff opponents, Texas and
Cleveland, the Padres have a legitimate ace in Brown, who has given
up just two runs in three postseason starts. He also has a career
record of 12-3 and a 2.50 ERA against the Yankees from his AL days.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres also have a lefty starter in Hitchcock, who has
developed a full repertoire of pitches to go with his forkball
since leaving New York a few years back and developed confidence.
Hitchcock beat Glavine and Maddux in the Atlanta series and the
Yankees, historically, have had more trouble with lefties.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres also have a go-to guy at the plate in Jim Leyritz.
Greg Vaughn, Tony Gwynn and Ken Caminiti have hobbled through the
playoffs; Leyritz, the former Yankee, has carried them with his big
stick.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, they seem overmatched. In the win column, they look to
be in too deep.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres shrug. In this season of baseball history and magic,
all it takes is a chance.

Clemens shares baseball, life with sixth-graders
<TEXT>
<P>
   By ALAN TRUEX &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL; 
``My name is Roger Clemens and they call me the Rocket.''
</P>
<P>
   With that self-introduction, the All-Star pitcher of the Toronto
Blue Jays began an interview session Friday at Spring Branch Middle
School _ just four miles from where Clemens lived as a child.
</P>
<P>
   A commanding presence at 6-4 and 230 solid pounds, Clemens
passed out autographed baseball cards and then stood in front of a
sixth-grade class, which included his son Koby, and held up a
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever heard bacon sizzle? That's what this sounds like when I
let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   He demonstrated pitching grips and talked baseball, but mostly
he provided lessons on life. His might be easy now as an $8
million-a-year pitcher, but it was difficult in his childhood. His
father died when he was 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in our basement, and he had a heart attack and an
ambulance came, and I didn't know what was going on,'' he told the
boys and girls in the language arts class of Liz Laconis. ``It was
a very traumatic time for me at a young age. My grades might have
suffered a little after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times when I got detention hall and bad grades. I
got picked on; people messed with my locker.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, 36, was being filmed for ESPN's Conversation in the
Classroom, which will air at 6:30 p.m. Friday. The concept is
children act as reporters, interviewing a pro athlete.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Spring Branch pupils asked Clemens if he knows Randy
Johnson, the Astros' pitcher who is about to become a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I know Randy,'' Clemens said. ``I hope he wants to stay
here and play. He may or he may not.''
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson goes elsewhere, the Astros could trade for Clemens,
who is expected to win an unprecedented fifth Cy Young Award after
claiming the American League's triple crown by leading the AL in
victories (20), ERA (2.65) and strikeouts (271).
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always the possibility I might play here,'' Clemens
said. ``There's a possibility of new ownership in Toronto in the
next month, and we'll have to see what they do with the budget,
which way they're going to go.''
</P>
<P>
   His contract has two years remaining, but an escape clause
allows him to force a trade if he believes the Blue Jays are not
trying to compete for a pennant next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to win in Toronto,'' Clemens said. ``But if that
doesn't happen, my first choice would not be to go to a powerhouse
like New York, which is always going to be competitive, and is
further from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather go to the Texas Rangers or to Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   After starting slowly this season, the Jays rallied with a 34-18
finish for an overall 88-74 record: good, but not good enough for
the postseason, which is where Clemens wants to be.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants to spend as much time as possible with his wife,
Debbie, his high school sweetheart at Spring Woods, and their four
boys: Koby, Kory, Kasey and Kody.
</P>
<P>
   One of the students asked Clemens why his children have names
beginning with K. ``That's what you write down in the scorebook
when it's a strikeout,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Family time is precious when dad plays baseball for a Canadian
team. The children spend the summer in Toronto, but during the
school year the boys are in Houston most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss the opportunity to go home and see them,'' Clemens
said. ``We try as a family not to go more than two weeks without
getting together. Sometimes Koby might get out of school on a
Thursday so he can see me, and we'll get him a tutor.''
</P>
<P>
   He was asked about his musical tastes. He prefers top-40 rock,
and country, but the music in the Blue Jays' locker room varies
because it's chosen by that game's starting pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have pitchers who like to blast heavy metal, and we've got
guys from the Dominican Republic who play their music,'' Clemens
said. ``When it's my turn I might play rock to get people in a good
mood, and some days I'll play country to get them to relax.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he ever ``gets mad at the umpires,'' Clemens
laughed and said, ``OK, cut the tape.''
</P>
<P>
   He has a painful memory of the 1990 AL Championship Series, when
he was ejected for foul language that offended plate umpire Terry
Cooney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty keyed up out there and I've gotten in trouble for
letting my emotions get the best of me,'' Clemens said.
</P>
<P>
   He warned the children that they too will suffer anxieties and
face ``a lot of tough calls.'' He said he ``lost three or four
close buddies in high school'' because they ``tried to drag me
down'' into drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time I was in the back seat of a guy's car, and I made him
let me out of the car,'' Clemens said, ``because they were doing
some things I knew they'd get in big trouble for.''
</P>
<P>
   He has seen promising careers destroyed by players who couldn't
resist temptations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next thing you know, they're out of the big leagues, and
they're saying, `I could have been a great baseball player,''' he
said. ``You don't want to look back on middle school or high school
and say, `I could have done this and I could have done that.'
You've got to try to be the best you can be now.''
</P>
<P>
   He was asked if he is going to win the Cy Young Award that goes
to the best pitcher in each major league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope so,'' he said. ``I said last year it was great to win
my fourth Cy Young Award so I could give one to each of my boys and
they could put it in their own house some day and remember all the
hard work their dad did to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   The many hours of weightlifting, the many miles of running have
contributed to 233 wins and remarkable durability for a power
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have fun playing the game,'' Clemens told the
sixth-graders. ``I like to hear you guys cheering and clapping when
I have two strikes on a big hitter and I'm trying to strike him
out.''
</P>
<P>
   When the time comes to retire, Clemens said he ``will do a lot
of work in the community and stay involved with kids like you.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rocket seems a long way from burning out.

CSUN WELCOMES BACK DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Derrick Higgins won't take a charge in a pickup
game. That's suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from that, he'll do anything defensively to stop his
opponent. It's an attitude more than an approach. One that was
lacking for Cal State Northridge's men's basketball team the moment
Higgins broke his right foot in the Matadors' fifth game last year.
</P>
<P>
   And an attitude Higgins will bring into today's first official
practice as Division I teams across the country break out the
basketballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word `defense' is secondary to everyone now,'' said
Higgins, a 6-foot-3, senior guard. ``You have to have the crossover
and dribble between the legs and the reverse dunk. You can get all
that, but my first priority is to get the ball back.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence CSUN allowed seven more points per game last
year than during the 1996-97 season. The Matadors, who went 12-16,
lost six games by seven points or less, a sure sign they missed
Higgins.
</P>
<P>
   ``He turned around games with his steals,'' CSUN associate head
coach Michael Johnson said. ``Against Northern Arizona we were down
six with three minutes to play and he had three steals and we
won.''
</P>
<P>
   During his one healthy season at CSUN, Higgins averaged 11.6
points. But it was his school-record 74 steals that caught
everyone's attention. When he broke his foot last season, Higgins
was averaging 10.2 points and 5.4 rebounds per game. Yet it was his
defense everyone noticed.
</P>
<P>
   It started during games with his brother, Keith, a former
Matador. They would play one-on-one, and the defense was ferocious.
That's where Higgins developed excitement about defense, and he
relishes the work that goes into being a good defender. That's why
he's been able to withstand the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   A junior college transfer, Higgins is about to begin his fourth
fall practice after the NCAA granted him a rare sixth year of
eligibility in June. He used his redshirt season after breaking his
left foot during the first week of practice during the 1995-96
season and has pins in both feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if anyone's gone seven years,'' Higgins, 23,
said. ``That would be a record. Even I can't do that. If it hurts,
I won't tell anybody. They won't even know. I could be on the court
grimacing and hurting. I'm playing defense. I don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Higgins didn't exactly select this drawn-out process for using
his eligibility, but if you're going to use a sixth year, this is a
nice time to do it. Despite returning two starters and four
letterwinners from last season, much is expected of CSUN.
Particularly in the Big Sky Conference.
</P>
<P>
   It's because five redshirts return, including point guard Markus
Carr. And it's because of the arrival of 6-foot-9, 250-pound Rico
Harris. He's an NBA prospect who transferred from Los Angeles City
College, where he averaged 24 points and 15 rebounds a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our individual work has been just on defensive
positioning,'' CSUN coach Bobby Braswell said. ``We have to play
good defense.''

NATO EXTENDS DEADLINE FOR WITHDRAWAL OF TROOPS FROM KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (In last graf, adds source for copy of agreement; polishing and
tightening throughout 1st section.)  (See also KOSOVO-ALBANIANS) 
(js) 
 BY STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO granted President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia a reprieve on Friday, extending by 10 days its deadline
for him to withdraw military and police forces cracking down on
ethnic Albanians in the province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of abundant evidence that Milosevic has not yet kept
his pledges to withdraw the forces, NATO's representatives in
Brussels gave him until Oct. 27 to comply or face the threat of
NATO military attacks.
</P>
<P>
   They said the reprieve bought time for international observers
to arrive in Kosovo. They also said it would allow NATO to start
surveillance flights.
</P>
<P>
   NATO had previously given Milosevic until Friday night to
comply, after voting on Tuesday to authorize limited cruise-missile
strikes against targets throughout Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Clinton administration officials maintained that the
extension of the deadline did not reflect a weakening of the
alliance's resolve to use force if Milosevic breaks the agreement
brokered earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   But diplomats who have returned to Kosovo said Friday that there
was no decrease in the police or military units and that there were
some skirmishes between those units, overwhelmingly Serb, and the
Kosovar rebels, who are ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   And the diplomats said there were some instances when they were
denied access to monitor any withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   There were signs Friday that the number of observers to be sent
in to deter fighting would be well below the 2,000 that Milosevic
accepted. Those observers, once they are in place, could gravely
complicate the ability to carry out any air strikes if Milosevic
fails to meet all the demands.
</P>
<P>
   The first reconnaissance flights _ an unprecedented incursion by
NATO into Yugoslav airspace _ are set to begin with a U.S. U-2 spy
plane on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said Friday evening that the
NATO allies, which approached the decision to use force with great
apprehension only after nine months of fighting and massacres, had
agreed that Milosevic needed more time to carry out the withdrawal
of his forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can quarrel a day or two one way or the other, but the
basic feeling was to give him a period of time in which he has no
excuse not to comply fully and then have it be automatic that the
authority to use force would be back,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, NATO's commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, presented
Yugoslav officials with a three-page list detailing, for the first
time, the number of military and police units that must pull out of
Kosovo to satisfy NATO. The list identified _ by unit name and
number _ 4,000 to 5,000 Yugoslav army troops and 3,000 to 4,000
interior police units that had poured into the province after the
crackdown began.
</P>
<P>
   Those troops were only a fraction of those involved in the
fighting, which, though ostensibly aimed at insurgents, killed
hundreds of civilians and drove tens of thousands from their homes.
Even if Milosevic withdraws the units on the list, the Yugoslav
army would have more than 12,000 troops in Kosovo, while the
interior police would have 6,000, according to U.S. intelligence
reports.
</P>
<P>
   While the U.N. resolution calling on Milosevic to end his
crackdown did not specify the exact number of troops to be
withdrawn, the current level of Serb troops whom NATO will allow to
remain in Kosovo falls far short of the Clinton administration's
public statements calling for a significant draw down of police and
military forces. It also appeared Friday that there would be far
fewer international observers than first announced.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. envoy who brokered the deal, had
challenged Milosevic to accept 2,000 monitors from the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which represents 54
countries in Europe, as well as the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But Holbrooke concocted the number before anyone asked the OSCE,
officials said. The organization, based in Vienna, is expected to
request fewer monitors, with one estimate suggesting there would be
no more than 800 observers.
</P>
<P>
   Ivo Daalder, a former adviser on the Balkans for the National
Security Council who is now a scholar at the Brookings Institute in
Washington, said the agreement with Milosevic left much unresolved,
while the decision to extend the deadline eased pressure on him to
comply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Milosevic hasn't complied _ and the deadline was
extended _ shows the deadline isn't serious, that the deadline is
no longer meaningful,'' Daalder said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has readied more than 400 warplanes, including 260 U.S.
jets. NATO and Pentagon officials said those aircraft would remain
on alert through the new deadline _ ready to strike, they insisted,
if needed. The aircraft carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower, along with
several warships and submarines capable of firing cruise missiles,
have also remained in the Adriatic Sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not NATO blinking,'' the State Department's spokesman,
James Rubin, said.
</P>
<P>
   However, it will not be possible for the alliance to keep those
planes poised indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO and administration officials pointed to signs that
Milosevic was complying. Some intelligence reports suggested that a
few Yugoslav army units had left the field, and journalists in the
provincial capital, Pristina, reported seeing a convoy of Yugoslav
armored vehicles, including tanks, leave the city.
</P>
<P>
   However, there was little indication that Milosevic had begun
any significant withdrawals, and clear evidence that some forces
had dug in for the winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lower visible presence of police and military,''
the senior administration official said. ``There are fewer
roadblocks. There is more movement. The place where the compliance
is least good is in the actual withdrawal.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Pentagon said the reconnaissance flights, which
were still being organized Friday, would give NATO officials an
absolute picture. The administration has trumpeted the flights as
one of the most significant concessions by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   However, the agreement says NATO will give the Yugoslav forces a
weekly schedule of flights, according to a copy of the agreement
obtained by The New York Times from someone outside the government
who is critical of the agreement. The agreement also calls for NATO
and Yugoslav air force officials to operate together at liaison
offices in the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, and the NATO air base at
Vicenza, Italy.

SHOSTAKOVICH: STILL A CATALYST OF CONTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the 40 years before his death in 1975, Dmitri
Shostakovich was no stranger to life-and-death controversy. In 1936
Stalin attacked his opera ``Lady Macbeth'' as ``crude, primitive,
vulgar''; the composer feared for his life. In 1948, an even larger
attack was mounted on his musical style; Shostakovich lost his
teaching job and again expected brutal knocks on the door.
</P>
<P>
   Now the spirit of Shostakovich is hovering over a Western debate
that recalls that earlier era in its heat and vituperation.
``Moronic tract,'' one scholar asserts about another's work;
``borderline fraudulent'' is a return volley. ``Classic
Soviet-style denunciation,'' declares one polemicist;
``McCarthyites,'' says another critic.
</P>
<P>
   And the point of contention? A book published 19 years ago,
``Testimony: The Memoirs of Dmitri Shostakovich.''
</P>
<P>
   From the moment the memoirs appeared in the West (they have yet
to be published in Russian), they have been violently attacked and
vigorously defended, dismissed as a forgery and hailed as a
revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the opening of some Soviet archives and the
accumulated testimony of those who knew the composer, the debate
has been reopened with a vengeance, most dramatically with the
publication of ``Shostakovich Reconsidered'' (Toccata Press), by an
American musicologist, Allan B. Ho, and an emigre pianist and
lawyer, Dmitry Feofanov.
</P>
<P>
   The two take arms against those who have questioned the
authenticity of the memoirs, calling ``Testimony'' _ which has now
appeared in more than a dozen languages _ ``one of the most
important and influential books in the history of music.''
</P>
<P>
   That conclusion, however, is vehemently disputed by major
American experts on Russian music, including Richard Taruskin, who
has called ``Testimony'' a ``fraud'' whose acceptance was ``the
greatest critical scandal I have ever witnessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year this dispute broke out at the American Musicological
Society, leading to a scheduled rematch at this year's meeting in
Boston on Oct. 31. The starkly opposed positions make it clear that
something bigger is at stake than whether Soviet musicologist
Solomon Volkov really did transcribe Shostakovich's most private
thoughts and have the chapters smuggled to the West for publication
after the composer's death.
</P>
<P>
   Interpretations of Shostakovich's life and music are being
wrestled over, along with questions about culture under
totalitarianism and the political meanings of music.
</P>
<P>
   That is because, for much of his career, Shostakovich was
thought to be precisely what the Soviet government said he was: a
patriotic Communist who amply displayed his loyalty, writing paeans
to Soviet forests and collective farms, joining the Party in 1960
and notoriously even signing a denunciation of Andrei Sakharov in
1973.
</P>
<P>
   The Western reception of Shostakovich was affected by that
image. During the World War II, Shostakovich's symphonies,
particularly the Fifth and the Seventh, were often welcomed in the
West as grand nationalist anthems. Later, in the Cold War period,
as Harold C. Schonberg put it, his output often seemed like
``propaganda-poster music.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Testimony'' decisively upset this view: ``Awaiting execution
is a theme that has tormented me all my life. The majority of my
symphonies are tombstones.'' The book's powerfully mordant voice
tells of denunciations and betrayals, of men soiling their pants in
fear of Stalin and of multiple meanings coded in the compositions,
which send out wrenching messages in camouflaged bottles.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Shostakovich began to be re-examined, questions were
raised about the authenticity of ``Testimony'' and its revisionist
view, questions that persist. Is the book really the memoirs of
Shostakovich? Does it give an accurate portrait of his life and
political position? And does it matter in listening or playing the
music itself?
</P>
<P>
   Two major challenges were raised to the authenticity of
``Testimony.'' The first, as Ho and Feofanov show, was officially
mounted in the Soviet Union, with the composer's family and
colleagues asserting that Volkov never had more than a passing
acquaintance with Shostakovich.
</P>
<P>
   Since then there have been recantations, repeated denunciations
and new accounts, including a friend's memory of the composer
mentioning his extended work with Volkov.
</P>
<P>
   But the contradictory testimony is a mine field of old
sympathies and vendettas, so it is not likely to settle the debate.

WINNING ATTITUDE GIVES PADRES EDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's look at the 1998 World Series through the prism of the
just-completed season.
</P>
<P>
   A mystical record is shattered not only by a mythic figure, Mark
McGwire, but also by a man of the people, Sammy Sosa, whose
personal postscript to the world after each home run was to touch
his heart and throw a kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Another baseball player who represents the working man, Cal
Ripken, took a well-timed day off, providing another cause to
celebrate baseball's return to prominence.
</P>
<P>
   And the San Diego Padres worked their way into the World Series
by using the strength of emotion and effort to beat two teams that
posted 100 victories this season, the Astros and Braves.
</P>
<P>
   So it isn't exactly logic which makes one embrace the Padres.
It's just a feeling, a case of going with the flow of a remarkable
season.
</P>
<P>
   There would be nothing remarkable about the Yankees winning the
series. They won 114 games during the regular season, and their
total is now up to 121. They won the series as recently as 1996,
and I can't recall that victory serving as a platform for
baseball's resurgence.
</P>
<P>
   The real tipoff in backing the Padres, at least for those
sniffing around for momentum, is that so many fans and media
experts believe they can't win. That's a misguided notion
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres can beat the Yankees because they have three solid
starters, and that's all you need in a World Series. One of those
pitchers is feared (Kevin Brown), one is underrated (Andy Ashby)
and the other is left-handed (Sterling Hitchcock) and on a personal
postseason roll.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres can beat the Yankees because they have a closer,
Trevor Hoffman, who is as dominating as Mariano Rivera, and they
can match the Yankees arm for arm in middle relief. The heart of
the Astro and Brave lineups hit well under .200 against the Padres
in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres yield to the Yankees in terms of depth in the lineup.
But the Padres have outhit and outhomered the Yankees in the
postseason, while facing the best two pitching staffs in the
National League this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' biggest edge is up the middle a better shortstop
(Derek Jeter over ex-Lakewood High and Long Beach Stater Chris
Gomez), a better second baseman (Chuck Knoblauch over Quilvio
Veres) and a better center fielder (Bernie Williams over Steve
Finley). But the Padres do not beat themselves. They made one error
in the NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres' biggest edge is attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Bochy is one of those quiet fumers. On his bench are two
former Dodgers remembered as superb competitors, Davey Lopes and
Dave Stewart, who have helped transform the clubhouse from beachy
to grouchy. In Kevin Brown and Ken Caminiti, the Padres have
cornered the market on players you would want in your foxhole.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Vaughn may have hit 50 home runs this season, but he still
has things to prove because of a lost '97 season in San Diego.
Likewise for Jim Leyritz, who shuttled between Texas, Anaheim and
Boston between World Series stops in New York (1996) and now San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   And there also is the last-dance factor. Nothing will hold Tony
Gwynn and Wally Joyner back from playing their best games, because
this may be the last chance either of them have to win a ring.
Gwynn refused to indulge in celebration of the division and NLCS
wins, because his eyes are on a bigger prize.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres also now have a home-field advantage; the ex-Murph
holds sound better since its renovation, and Padre fans have
discovered their voice. How ironic. The park was renovated to sell
more Charger seats, and it's the Padres who are filling them.
</P>
<P>
   And how about this trend? Since 1990, the team with the most
regular-season wins in baseball did not win the subsequent World
Series. This includes four teams that won 100 or more games.
</P>
<P>
   The personal clincher? I look at things and ask, ``what would be
the worst possible result for baseball's new whipping boy, the Los
Angeles Dodgers?''
</P>
<P>
   Easy. Padres in seven.

 UNDATED: the debate.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The other major challenge to ``Testimony,'' though, has been
more damning. In a much-cited paper from 1980 in ``The Russian
Review,'' a musicologist, Laurel Fay, who is now writing a
biography of Shostakovich, proved that seven extended passages from
the memoirs are taken from Shostakovich's published essays and
appear at the beginnings of the book's chapters. So the book is
not, as it claims, an arbitrarily constructed transcription of the
composer's words.
</P>
<P>
   Her argument convinced important American scholars, particularly
because Volkov has never made available either the original Russian
typescript (which he says has been sold to a private collector) or
his notes (which, he says, for security reasons were never saved).
In a recent telephone interview, Ms. Fay said she remained unswayed
by the latest rebuttals.
</P>
<P>
   Ho and Feofanov's argument is that none of her evidence is
conclusive. Shostakovich was renowned for his photographic memory
and would easily recite long passages from novels and poems; two of
the passages were also published during the compilation of the
memoirs. Volkov, in a rare interview in his New York apartment this
month, said that though he had been ``surprised'' by Ms. Fay's
revelations, he can understand how previously published material
came to head most of the chapters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Shostakovich started to talk with me, he would start like
a locomotive slowly, to warm up,'' he explained. In each session
Shostakovich ``kind of smoothed the beginnings, when he was much
more nervous than I.'' Such passages, Volkov guesses, might have
been the excerpts, which are among the least significant portions
of the book: ``I always started a chapter with the starting point
of some conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   These are important issues, but the great passions that have
arisen are not simply about textual matters. They are about the
political image of the composer. Critics of ``Testimony'' assert
that in hailing Shostakovich as a secret dissident, a vulgar
orthodoxy has taken shape. Supporters think their critics are
ignorant of Soviet life and Shostakovich's character.
</P>
<P>
   The odd thing, however, is the extent of agreement. As Ho and
Feofanov point out, the composer's critical attitudes toward the
regime he served are now widely taken for granted, confirmed by the
publication of some of Shostakovich's letters, along with accounts
in Elizabeth Wilson's 1994 ``Shostakovich: A Life Remembered''
(Princeton University Press).
</P>
<P>
   So as for the broad political image of Shostakovich in
``Testimony,'' Ms. Fay now says: ``I don't have any problem with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   This means that the most revelatory aspect of the ``Testimony''
portrait may no longer be controversial. The polemical battles are
now over qualifications and boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Taruskin, for example, has attacked what he calls ``simplistic
revisionism'' and hero worship. Shostakovich, he writes, should not
really be thought of as a ``dissident'' despite his musical
expressions of despair; if he ever did talk about his past,
Taruskin suggests, he may have even distorted it, feeling he had
``a history of collaboration to live down.''
</P>
<P>
   And Taruskin argues that Shostakovich's ``Lady Macbeth,'' itself
had Stalinist characteristics _ an assertion that has inspired
furious rebuttals.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Ms. Fay has argued that the composer's ``From Jewish
Folk Poetry'' was not an act of courageous protest against Soviet
anti-Semitism. Instead, Ms. Fay writes, Shostakovich (who was not
Jewish) was just making a ``good-faith effort'' to answer Stalinist
criticism and write accessible music based on folk sources;
virulent anti-Semitism didn't even erupt until after 1948, when the
composition was already completed _ and then it couldn't be
performed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was his rotten luck,'' Ms. Fay writes, ``that of all the
available nationalities, great and small, he just happened to pick
the wrong `folk' as his inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   That notion too is strenuously attacked in the Ho and Feofanov
book as historically flawed and failing to recognize that allusions
to Jewish music and Soviet anti-Semitism were, as asserted in
``Testimony,'' central themes for the composer.
</P>
<P>
   But what then of the music's new political meanings? ``Meaning
in music.'' says ``Testimony'''s Shostakovich. ``That must sound
very strange for most people. Particularly in the West. It's here
in Russia that the question is usually posed: What was the composer
trying to say, after all, with this musical work? What was he
trying to make clear? The questions are naive of course, but
despite their naivete and crudity, they definitely merit being
asked.''
</P>
<P>
   And now they are _ not just about a composer's intent, but about
the music's effects and the listener's perspective. The philosopher
Leo Strauss suggested that literature written under persecution can
develop a double voice, hiding an esoteric meaning under its public
veneer. ``Testimony'' had such an impact, partly because it
suggested that this is true of Shostakovich's music. This affects
how the music is played, the ways phrases are shaped and stressed,
even how a performance is structured.
</P>
<P>
   The violinist Rostislav Dubinsky has suggested that differing
approaches to Shostakovich's string quartets in the Soviet Union
arose out of differing understandings of the composer's persona.
</P>
<P>
   The doubleness can be very explicit. The composer specified
political programs for some of his symphonies so they seemed to be
glorifying Soviet history; many Soviet listeners though, heard
other programmatic strains.
</P>
<P>
   Is the ``Leningrad'' Symphony about the Nazi siege or a horrific
evocation of the Stalin purges? Are the massacres of the 1905
rebellion being invoked in the 11th symphony or the confrontations
with Communist authority?
</P>
<P>
   The Fifth Symphony has come under particularly close scrutiny
because it was billed as a response to ``just criticism'' after
Stalin's 1936 attack. Is its final movement a festive celebration
(as hailed by the Party), or, is it an anxious, forced rejoicing
(as described in ``Testimony'')?
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it may be both _ and more. Even Volkov believes it
to be ``more complicated'' than the way Shostakovich presented to
him. ``He really hated this feeling of being in this mob,'' Volkov
said. ``But I also remember this feeling. You can hate it as you
wish, but at some point you are swept up in this. Because it is a
big power.'' It overwhelms, threatens, seduces and horrifies. The
first listeners wept. And Taruskin, cautious about programmatic
interpretation, is moved to describe the coda as ``an act of
witness that gives voice to the wounded.''
</P>
<P>
   Those varied acts of witness are being wrestled over in the
Shostakovich wars. A generation after the death of this complex
figure, his musical testimony continues to recall his awful times;
now it is spurring scholarship into passions that echo, in their
distress and anger, the moral urgency of the music.

RELIGION: ENCYCLICAL IS A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE IN HUMAN REASON 
</HEADLINE>
  (also see POPE-ENCYCLICAL and POPE-ANNIVERSARY) 
(bl) 
 By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a decade when frantic and information-sodden people must rely
on handy aids like ``Wittgenstein in 90 Minutes'' and ``Dating for
Dummies,'' can't someone do the same for the pope, who at the age
of 78 keeps producing long and idea-packed encyclicals?
</P>
<P>
   ``Wojtyla in 90 Minutes''? ``John Paul II for Dummies''?
</P>
<P>
   If such an abbreviated treatment existed, here are three
observations it might include on the remarkable document, ``Fides
et Ratio'' (``Faith and Reason''), that John Paul II has issued on
the 20th anniversary of his pontificate.
</P>
<P>
   First, the tone of ``Fides et Ratio'' is positive and embracing.
The pope is resolute, not surprisingly, in his affirmations of the
truths of faith but measured in his criticisms. Even when worrying
about contemporary nihilism, the document has none of the
apocalyptic pitch this pope occasionally reaches (``the culture of
death''); nor does it scold. His appraisals of major trends in
current thought are sharp but almost always accompanied by
appreciative acknowledgments of their strengths and insights.
</P>
<P>
   Second, ``Fides et Ratio'' is an extraordinary vote of
confidence in the human mind and the capacity of human reason to
reach objective truth and real knowledge. Be bold, is the pope's
exhortation to philosophers, and by extension to thinking people
generally. (``Every man and woman is in some sense a
philosopher.'') Take on ``the fundamental questions which pervade
human life,'' he urges, questions that arise from both the wonder
of existence and the challenge of suffering and death.
</P>
<P>
   There is an obvious irony in the fact that the Catholic papacy,
once viewed as the leading enemy of the inquiring mind, is now
urging philosophers to overcome their ``false modesty'' and go
where they fear to tread. Philosophy should recover its
``sapiential dimension'' and its ``metaphysical range'' _ its
concern for the practical wisdom that people can live by and its
stretch for a truth that, however imperfect and inevitably
analogical, goes beyond ``the factual and the empirical.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II is aware that this appeal will appear ``daunting''
to many contemporary thinkers, and he recognizes that their
resistance to such ambitions arises in part from the bleak
experience of a bloody age and from a fear that any strong claims
to truth ultimately encourage intolerance. He tries to turn this
argument around: it is the moral vacuum created by human reason's
abandonment of its search for fundamental truths, he maintains,
that breeds totalitarianism; and it is the belief in the
possibility of a universally valid truth that provides ``the
essential condition'' for authentic dialogue between people of
different viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   Third, ``Fides et Ratio'' spells out a complex and subtle notion
of the mutual relationships between faith and reason. They are
neither opposed nor identical, nor simply added one upon the other.
Roman Catholicism has long been critical of stances that make faith
a dramatic departure or ``leap'' from what is rational. And while
the pope insists on the centrality of Revelation for faith, he also
insists that philosophy must proceed by its own rigorous methods
and not simply rubber-stamp the beliefs of faith.
</P>
<P>
   In John Paul II's account, faith and reason are interwoven
throughout the process of searching for truth. Simply to comprehend
the language and credibility of Revelation is to employ, implicitly
or explicitly, the tools of reason. And Revelation, the pope
states, opens up questions and possible answers for reason that it
would not otherwise recognize.
</P>
<P>
   This has a practical consequence for the Roman Catholic Church _
and maybe for other bodies of believers, too. The division of labor
between theology and philosophy can never be neat. Philosophy,
therefore, has to be an important part of theological education.
</P>
<P>
   That was, of course, the case for Catholicism before the Second
Vatican Council. Not only was theology highly philosophical,
relying as much on reasoning in the deductive mode as on Scripture
or religious experience, but so was the ethos of Catholicism
generally. Catholic thinkers defined terms, made distinctions,
constructed syllogisms and wielded proofs and analogies with such
vigor that critics within the church as well as outside complained
that church leaders operated under the illusion that people could
be argued into faith.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three decades there has been a sharp swing in the
other direction. Not only have biblical studies been given a new
emphasis _ a change no one has challenged _ but philosophical
training for priests have often become a patchwork of views, and
theologians and spiritual writers have eschewed the rigors of
reasoning that had before been almost reflexive. The pope is
clearly calling for a course correction.
</P>
<P>
   It seems hardly likely that he wants a return to the kind of
textbook Thomism that characterized seminary training in an earlier
era. While he hails the accomplishments of St. Thomas Aquinas, he
also declares that the church has no official philosophy and he
clearly welcomes a wide range of philosophical approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Like other papal documents, ``Fides et Ratio'' may be seized
upon by various factions struggling for leverage in the church.
Liberals may be quick to point out that unlike some other recent
encyclicals and the English translation of the Catechism of the
Catholic Church, this one is written in gender-neutral language.
They may chuckle at the fact that two of the modern Catholic
philosophers the pope praises by name, John Henry Newman and
Antonio Rosmini, had to endure Vatican suspicion and attack in
their lifetimes.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives, on the other hand, may be quick to note that some
of the past papal documents that John Paul II cites _ although not
the particular passages _ were highly denunciatory of the
liberalism of their time.
</P>
<P>
   Such partisanship would be a disservice to the encyclical. It is
by no means a complete argument. It is a map, not a journey _ a
proposal for future directions in human thought that should
stimulate considered responses from believers and nonbelievers of
all sorts.

 ,  64, is identified with wide-ranging work on poverty. There was
plenty of schadenfreude as well. The forced sale of Long-Term
Capital Management, the immense hedge fund for the very rich and
powerful that had been built upon the application of Merton and
Scholes' latest formulas, seems to have cost the laureates' their
considerable personal fortunes. (They were among its partners.)
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yet a look at the pattern of the prizes of the last four years
shows that the Swedish Academy of Sciences, which makes the award,
has put a great deal of effort into saying something about the
state of modern economics that is interesting, encouraging, and, to
many, persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   I say four years because it was five years ago that Assar
Lindbeck, leader of an older generation among Swedish economists,
retired from the committee that prepares the recommendations for
the prize. He had served as its leader since it began. He was no
stick-in-the-mud; far from it. But he took others with him, and
with their departure leadership passed to the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, the economics Nobel is a recent invention. Its proper
name is the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of
Alfred Nobel. The idea was to commemorate the 300th anniversary of
the founding of Sweden's central bank.
</P>
<P>
   The prize was first awarded in 1969, its reception greatly eased
by the long economic boom of the 1950s and 1960s and the sense that
a breakthrough of some sort finally had been achieved by the dismal
science. It joined the five original prizes stipulated in 1895 by
the will of the explosives magnate _ in physics, chemistry,
medicine or physiology, literature, and peace.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the reputation of economics among the general public
has gone mostly downhill. But the Nobel committee was charged with
taking the long view, and for 25 years it carefully charted the
pattern by which economics became its modern self. Within the
profession the committee achieved great authority, working off its
backlog &UR;  &LR; of worthy winners, producing mostly hits and only a few
wheezes in the most political of sciences.
</P>
<P>
   With the general public, too, it maintained credibility,
favoring neither left nor right. In 1974 it split the difference,
dividing the prize equally between Gunnar Myrdal and Friedrich
Hayek.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1980s, however, the committee was caught up in the
ideological battles of the decade, unable to agree about where the
spotlight should be turned. Economics felt itself to have been
progressing rapidly, yet in 1988 and 1989, prizes went for work
done in 1944. Lags between the work itself and its citation in
Stockholm were averaging 40 years _ as opposed to 10 or 12 in
chemistry and biology as and less in physics.
</P>
<P>
   Then Lindbeck stepped down, the composition of the committee
changed, and whammo! Robert Lucas of the University of Chicago was
cited in 1995. Nobody represented better than Lucas the
discontinuous nature of the change that occurred in economics
during the 1970s. With his 1972 paper on the non-neutrality of
money, he had used high-tech math to bring into sharper focus the
role of individuals' expectations in economic life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, James Mirrlees and William Vickrey were honored. The
fact that they shared the citation seemed to cast the new message
into even sharper relief. Vickery, born in 1914, was an old
fashioned verbal economist, quite brilliant in his day, which
spanned from World War II to the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Mirrlees, on the other hand, born in 1936, was a mathematical
economist whose 1971 article on optimal nonlinear income taxation
was all but indecipherable to those outside the field. And yet
their contributions to the theory of information and incentives
were pretty much the same.
</P>
<P>
   See? the Swedes seemed to be saying: the new high-tech methods
do the same as the old and do it better; they are less ambiguous
and more easily understood and tested. Mirrlees' influence among
his peers was enormous, while Vickrey had been all but forgotten by
the young. As if to underscrore the point, Vickrey died of a heart
attack three days after the award was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the 1997 award to Merton and Scholes. (A third
contributor, Fischer Black, had died the year before.) The
revolutionary Black-Scholes options pricing formula had been
introduced in 1972, generalized by Merton, and shortly therefter
programmed into hand-held calculators used by traders around the
world. It was perhaps the most dominating demonstration of the
practical significance of economic theory ever achieved.
</P>
<P>
   The Nobel committee had clearly moved the frontier of
prize-quality work into the era of the Vietnam War. And in this
respect, this year's award to Sen is no exception: ``Collective
Choice and Social Welfare,'' the first of Sen's three books cited
by the committee, was published in 1970. ``On Economic Inequality''
followed in 1973 and ``Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement
and Deprivation'' in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   In another respect, too, Sen's award is similiar to the others.
His work on the theory of ``social choice,'' on which the citation
dwelt at length, is highly technical. An abstract, almost
philosophical field dealing with collective decision-making, social
choice begins with the propounding of axioms, propositions taken to
be true whose relevance is nevertheless hard to pin down.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the other bodies of work, Sen's writings lack the
single drop-dead insight that changes the way a particular problem
is perceived and galvanizes other researchers to work variations on
the theme. Instead, his contributions to social choice are
persistently critical.
</P>
<P>
   They point to difficulties of the ``impossibility'' theorem that
is at the core of social choice: how can satisfactory collective
decision-making be impossible when it happens every day? Sen's
writings therefore raise doubts about the significance of the very
activity of which they are a part. Very clever the insights are,
very provocative too _ but they are not the kind of theory-and-tool
building exercises &UR;  &LR; that won the prize in the three previous years.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Sen's Nobel Prize is being described by many senior
economists as a kind of a ``person'' prize, a lifetime achievement
award instead of a matter of depersonalized science. And so it is.
</P>
<P>
   But what a career! Forty years of calling attention to the
plight of the most impoverished members of society in an
astonishing variety of ways, from high philosophy to measurement
economics to pointed empirical work. Sen's work on famines is well
known _ they are man-made events, he has shown, not vicissitudes of
the weather, and they never, ever happen in democracies, where
those who are starving have a political voice. But perhaps the
single most striking result he ever obtained was the case of the
missing women.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of simple calculations relying on research by
others, Sen showed that women generally outnumber men in Europe and
North America. They are hardier and survive better at all ages.
They don't smoke as much and they don't go to war. So even though
around 5 percent more boys are born than girls around the world,
women outnumber men in the industrial democracies.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia and North Africa, however, the situation is reversed.
Even adjusting for lower life expectancies, there were 44 million
``missing women'' in China in 1992 and 37 million in India, of a
total of more than 100 million worldwide _ if the male-female ratio
of Eurpe and America prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Rough treatment all around, Sen found. Worse health care,
less food, little education, fewer property rights, even the custom
of ``hiding'' newborns who are girls. Social inequality outweighted
the natural survival advantages of women in these lands.
</P>
<P>
   It is a perfect example of the Sen style. No wonder every
university wants him. (He taught at Harvard for a decade until
Cambridge University lured him back last spring with the mastership
of its richest college.) His contribution is not so much a tool as
a sensibility. He is a 20th century Jane Austin, richly cultured
himself, whose topic is not the manners of the rich, but the
problems of the poor.
