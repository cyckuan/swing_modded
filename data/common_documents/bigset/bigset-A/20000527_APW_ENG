FBI: New Computer Virus Spreading
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new and dangerous computer virus is spreading through
email systems using Microsoft Outlook, the FBI said Friday night. Anti-virus
industry sources are reporting that a number of corporate e-mail systems have
already been infected, and some shut down, the FBI's National Infrastructure
Protection Center said. The virus is carried in e-mail with the subject ''Resume
- Janet Simons'' and once opened, spreads itself to everyone in a user's e-mail
address book. It also attempts to delete a number of files on the user's system.
The FBI advised computer users not to open any e-mail with this subject line, to
deactivate the executive summary feature in Microsoft Outlook, and then delete
the e-mail without opening it. The anti-virus industry was working on software
patches to stop the virus, the FBI said.

3 Wounded In Fiji Shooting
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Two soldiers and a journalist wounded were wounded
Saturday after a gun battle broke out in Fiji between rebels who have been
trying for a week to seize power and government soldiers. The shots were fired
about one-quarter mile from Parliament where coup leader George Speight and
about 60 gunmen have been holding Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and more than
30 members of his government hostage. Chaudhry, who was elected prime minister
last year, is the first leader of Fiji from its ethnic Indian minority. The
shooting occurred after about 200 supporters of the coup and at least three of
the armed rebels left the parliamentary compound and confronted about eight
soldiers at the roadblock.

Police: Student Kills Fla. Teacher
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LAKE WORTH, Fla. (AP) -- Police said a 13-year-old student who fatally shot a
teacher Friday with a semi-automatic pistol got the gun and bullets from a
dresser drawer at his grandfather's house last week. Seventh grader Nathaniel
Brazill was sent home from school for throwing water balloons on the last day of
classes and returned to Lake Worth Community Middle School shortly before 3:30
p.m., Police Chief William Smith said. He spoke to teacher Barry Grunow, pulled
out a .25-caliber pistol and fired a single shot, killing the 35-year-old
language arts teacher, he said. Brazill flagged down a police officer about a
quarter mile from the school and surrendered. Smith said police are considering
filing charges against the grandfather.

Mexican Candidates Debate
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- In a crucial debate Friday night ahead of a tight
presidential election, two opposition candidates lashed out at the party that
has ruled Mexico for 71 years, accusing it of leaving millions in poverty. ''The
(governing) PRI has turned our country into a factory of poverty and of the
poor,'' said Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the left-center Democratic Revolution Party.
Even Francisco Labastida, candidate of the PRI -- the Institutional
Revolutionary Party -- called for changes in the tough free-market policies of
the last three presidents, to ''recover the essence of the popular spirit'' of
Mexico's revolution and to spread income more equitably.

Federal Judge Sets Execution Date
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- A federal judge Friday set an Aug. 5 execution date for
convicted killer Juan Raul Garza, who would become the first federal prisoner
put to death in almost four decades. U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela's order
calls for Garza to be executed by injection at 6 a.m. at the federal death
chamber in Terre Haute, Ind. Garza, 43, who was convicted Brownsville, Texas, in
August 1993 for killing three men between April 1990 and January 1991, is among
20 inmates awaiting execution. Because of pending appeals, no other inmate has
an execution date. The last federal execution was in 1963.

   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Trans States Airlines and its pilots reached a tentative
contract agreement late Friday, averting a strike and reinstating about half of
the airline's canceled flights as the busy Memorial Day weekend got under way.
Officials for the St. Louis-based regional airline and the pilots' union had met
with federal negotiators in Washington for most of today. The pilots had
threatened to walk off the job at 11:01 p.m. Pilots spokesman Hal Myers
confirmed the tentative agreement. The union membership must approve the

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- First baseman Ryan Klesko and the San Diego
Padres agreed Friday to a $18.75 million, three-year contract
extension that runs through the 2004 season.
</P>
<P>
   Klesko, who was acquired Dec. 22 from the Atlanta Braves, had
been signed through the 2001 season. He is making $5.75 million
this season and gets $6.5 million next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''In spring training. I think they wanted to look over a new
player. Now I'm just glad to sign,'' Klesko said. ''I want to
stress how much I like the organization from the owner to the
general manager to (manager) Bruce Bochy. I want to have a place to
call home for a few years.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first 39 games with the Padres, Klesko hit .301 with nine

   Klesko, 28, spent his first 11 professional seasons with the
Braves organization, including all or part of the last eight
seasons in Atlanta. He is a career .282 hitter with 148 home runs
and 480 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It didn't take long for me to realize that San Diego is where
I want to play for a long time,'' Klesko said.

<HEADLINE> Shooting Breaks Out in Fiji  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- A gunbattle broke out Saturday between rebels
who have been trying for a week to seize power in Fiji and
government troops, leaving two soldiers and a journalist wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The shots were fired about one-quarter of a mile from
Parliament, where rebel leader George Speight and about 60 gunmen
have been holding Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and more than 30
members of his government hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry, elected last year, is the first leader of Fiji from
its ethnic Indian minority. Speight claims to be acting on behalf
of the Pacific island nation's majority ethnic Fijians, and wants
to reduce the powers that Indians can hold in the government.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's shootout with military forces, the first since the
takeover began May 19, occurred after about 200 supporters of the
coup and at least three armed rebels left the parliamentary
compound and confronted about eight soldiers at a roadblock.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to remove the roadblock, the supporters tried to
grab the soldiers' weapons and pushed one of them to the ground.
The other soldiers fired warning shots. The rebels shot back,
setting off a brief gunbattle before both groups dispersed.
</P>
<P>
   Two soldiers and a cameraman for Associated Press Television
News were wounded. Officials said one soldier was hit in the
shoulder and the other in the leg. Jerry Harmer, 38, of Britain, a
senior producer and cameraman for Associated Press Television News,
was shot in the right wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at Suva's Colonial War Memorial hospital said Harmer's
condition was good.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers withdrew and were chased by the rebels, who threw
rocks and tore down tents erected at the checkpoint. The rebels
stopped their charge at a second checkpoint, which had been
abandoned by police when the shooting started, and they eventually
returned to Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The clash came a day after scores of Fijians rushed into the
parliamentary compound to support the rebels, flooding past
military barricades to join them.
</P>
<P>
   The leading defector was Maj. Josefa Savua, the brother of
Fiji's Police Commissioner Isikia Savua. He said he joined the
rebels ''because I am a Fijian. I want a future for my children.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This might be the beginning,'' said rebel spokesman Simione
Taikani. ''The police might come. Everybody might come.''
</P>
<P>
   In another development, a committee of the Great Council of
Chiefs -- the supreme body representing Fiji's various tribal
royalty -- re-entered negotiations on Friday with Speight to try to
end the eight-day crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Speight is demanding immunity from prosecution, the abrogation
of Fiji's constitution and the resignation of President Ratu Sir
Kamisese Mara, who has declared a state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-hour meeting, the chief's committee spokesman, Epeli
Kanaimaii, reported no agreement and said meetings would resume
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Speight, who was not involved in the shootout, blamed the
confrontation on Mara's decision to bolster security around the
compound with military checkpoints, in addition to police
checkpoints set up last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want the army to be deployed, restricting the movement
of people and the free access of people who wish to come and go as
they please,'' Speight told a news conference inside the compound
after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   He said he authorized his men to remove the roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I authorize, tacitly, any action that our security forces feel
is necessary in order to remove a threat from the perimeter of this
complex,'' Speight said.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Isikia Savua announced Friday that he had
handed over security around Parliament to the army because armed
men from the compound had been approaching checkpoints at night and
threatening officers. Fiji's police do not carry guns.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations and foreign governments including the United
States, Britain, Australia and New Zealand have criticized the
tribal leaders for not cracking down on Speight and his backers.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said the chiefs
had 48 hours to support the democratically elected government or
face economic and political sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Speight is a terrorist -- this is an act of terror,''
Downer said in Canberra.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji is located in the Pacific 2,250 miles northeast of Sydney,
Australia. Ethnic Indians make up 44 percent of the population of
813,000, while indigenous Fijians account for 51 percent.

<HEADLINE> Royals 9, Angels 4  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG TUCKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Jermaine Dye's leadoff drive started the
first four-homer inning in the history of the Royals, an eight-run
sixth that powered Kansas City past the Anaheim Angels 9-4 Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   With Anaheim leading 4-1 in the sixth, Dye and Mark Quinn hit
solo homers off Seth Etherton, who was making his major league
debut. Eric Weaver (0-1) relieved and gave up six runs and five
hits without getting an out.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Johnson's three-run homer put the Royals ahead 6-4 and
Carlos Febles added another three-run shot. Kansas City had 14
three-homer innings in its 31{-season history.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Damon also homered as the Royals took a 1-0 lead in the
first off Etherton, a first-round pick in the 1998 draft pick. He
gave up Damon's homer and a double to Febles within his first six
pitchers, then retired 13 of his next 15 batters.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim matched its team mark by allowing four homers in an
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett Anderson and Darin Erstad homered for the Angels, who
set a team record by raising their May home-run total to 42. Kansas
City has allowed 82 long balls, the most in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was ejected in the eighth for arguing a called strike,
and Mike Scioscia was tossed for the first time as Anaheim's
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Fussell (4-2) allowed four runs and five hits in six
innings to win for the third time in four starts.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City's Carlos Beltran, coming out of a season-long slump,
had a triple and two doubles for his third three-hit game in five
outings. Febles had a homer, single and double.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim built its 4-1 lead on Anderson's two-run homer in the
second, Ben Molina's RBI single in fourth and Erstad's solo homer
in the fifth. Erstad went 2-for-4, and retook the AL batting lead
at .379, two points better than Ivan Rodriguez of Texas.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Ricky Bottalico pitched three innings for his fourth save.
... Damon has led off a game with a home run 10 times. ... The
start of the game was delayed 71 minutes by a heavy thunderstorm.
... Rich Devine, fifth-year senior and popular outfielder at nearby
Emporia State (Kan.) who batted .416 last season, was signed by the
Royals on Friday. ... The Royals have had consecutive home runs
twice this year. ... The Angels threw 23 pitches to Quinn alone in
the sixth. ... The Angels gave up four home runs in an inning in
1963 and 1995. ... The Royals sent 12 men to the plate in the sixth
inning, which lasted 35 minutes. ... The Angels previous record of
41 homers in May had been set in 1961.

<HEADLINE> Nine-state plea for allergy warnings on food cheers parents, advocates </HEADLINE>
By L. ANNE NEWELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Some allergies mean you can't have a cat.
Others mean you can't wear certain materials. But some mean you
have to read every ingredient of every product you buy every time
you go to the grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Albany resident Lori Ira. Ira's daughter, Kaitlyn, 9,
is allergic to almonds and peanuts and almost every other kind of
nut. Trips to the grocery store turn into arduous adventures and
there's always the fear that something that slipped into a product
could cause a deadly reaction.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Ira, who founded the New York Nut Allergy Awareness
Group, is putting her support behind a coalition of attorney
generals from nine states, led by New York. The group is calling on
food manufacturers to more clearly label products that contain
ingredients such as peanuts and eggs, which can be deadly to people
with certain allergies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a strong belief that the vast majority of deaths
attributed to food allergy are preventable deaths and needless
deaths,'' said Mark Violette, a spokesman for New York Attorney
General Eliot Spitzer. ''The deaths can be prevented sometimes in
ways as simple as clearer labeling on food packaging.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 6 million and 7 million Americans are affected by food
allergies, according to the Food Allergy Network, an international
research and education organization based in Virginia. The group
estimates that about 125 people die each year from consuming food
to which they are allergic.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys general sent their request to the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration Friday, asking the agency to:
</P>
<P>
   --Create a symbol, such as a circled letter ''A'' and require
manufacturers to prominently display that symbol on a specific area
of the food packaging. The symbol would denote the product contains
potentially allergenic substances such as peanuts, tree nuts, milk,
eggs, fish, crustaceans, mollusks, wheat and soy beans.
</P>
<P>
   --Establish a toll-free hotline for consumers through which they
can obtain reliable food ingredient information.
</P>
<P>
   --Mandate food ingredient lists include all ingredients, even if
used in trace amounts.
</P>
<P>
   --Establish food industry guidelines to prevent allergenic
ingredients from spreading to one product to another during food
processing and preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm thrilled,'' Ira said. ''It's hard to have faith in the
things that we purchase in stores. This will certainly make
purchasing food products a lot more reassuring.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Welch, a spokeswoman for the FDA, said the agency would
give the request ''careful consideration'' when it is received.
</P>
<P>
   Food Allergy President and CEO Anne Munoz-Furlong praised the
effort by the attorneys general but said it could be misguided.
</P>
<P>
   She cautioned that any labeling effort needs to take place on a
national level so consumers have a standard symbol to look for and
that a hotline could be dangerous since ingredients can change from
week to week.
</P>
<P>
   ''A better solution would be to work on a national level to
improve the ingredient statements on all products,'' she said.
''The labeling is extremely important and it's got to be something
they can trust. They're making a life or death decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Violette, whose 12-year-old son is allergic to peanuts, also
said he could not underestimate the importance of the requests. But
he emphasized it is not just about drawing awareness to the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''We fully expect the FDA to address these concerns seriously,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other states joining in New York's request are Connecticut,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, Vermont and
Wyoming.

<HEADLINE> Woman who built up beauty-salon chain credited as founder of franchising </HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Who invented franchising, an industry set
to surpass $1 trillion in U.S. sales this year? Ray Kroc of
McDonald's Corp. in 1955? Standard-menu pioneer Howard Dearing
Johnson in 1926? Rexall Drug pharmacist Louis Liggett in 1902?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong century, wrong sex.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1800s, Martha Matilda Harper, a 5-foot-tall domestic
with floor-length hair, created what a new biography calls
America's first retail franchise: a beauty-salon chain that, at its
peak in 1928, boasted 500 ''branches'' worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Harper Hair Dressing Salons prided themselves on trademark
tonics and creams, and high-quality, standardized service.
President Woodrow Wilson showed up for relaxing scalp massages at
Harper's in Paris while negotiating the Treaty of Versailles in
1919.
</P>
<P>
   How could such an innovative, formidable entrepreneur fade into
obscurity?
</P>
<P>
   ''There's been a marked absence of Harper from history books -- I
think it's because our society was not ready to acknowledge the
brilliance of a businesswoman,'' said Jane Plitt, a visiting
scholar at the University of Rochester and author of ''Martha
Matilda Harper and the American Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   A seven-month Harper exhibit featuring a replica of a 1920s
salon opens today at the Rochester Museum &AMP; Science Center.
</P>
<P>
   Harper's picaresque journey began in poverty in Canada. From the
age of 7, she worked for 25 years as a servant and, through a
friendship with an herbalist, learned about vigorous scalp
treatments and shampoo formulas used to help retain hair's healthy
sheen.
</P>
<P>
   After opening her first shop here in 1888, she recruited
working-class women to run salons from San Francisco to Detroit and
Edinburgh to Berlin. Often relying on their mentor's backing,
''Harperites'' remained loyal to her long after they became
financially independent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Back then, women always seemed to have to work harder than men
to accomplish anything,'' said Jane Reed, 83, who got a job at a
Harper salon in 1941 and owned her own one from 1964 to 1995 in
Coral Gables, Fla. ''She did a lot to get women established in
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper ran training schools, set up coordinated advertising,
insisted on organic ingredients. She designed business duplication
tools mandatory in every salon, notably the first reclining shampoo
chair and a sink with a cutout lip for the neck to fit in.
</P>
<P>
   She died in 1950 at age 93, but the Harper Method operated until
1972 when its assets were bought by a competitor. ''This woman
perfected modern franchising,'' Plitt said. ''There's just no doubt
-- she's got it down to a T.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no reason to dispute it,'' said Terry Hill of the
International Franchise Association.
</P>
<P>
   Franchising, however, is more closely associated with companies
like Kentucky Fried Chicken and Holiday Inn hotels that emerged in
the ''high-water mark'' years of business growth after World War II
and survive to this day, Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   The reason Harper is little-known ''could be one of those
cultural anomalies where women just weren't considered business
people'' during her era, he said. ''It's been a man's world for a
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are an estimated 350,000 franchise companies
operating globally in 75 industries.

<HEADLINE> Padres 6, Expos 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Tony Gwynn doubled twice and Hideki Irabu lost
in his first game at San Diego as the Padres rallied past the
Montreal Expos 6-2 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn, who left in the fifth inning Wednesday night when he
stumbled legging out a double, was 2-for-3 with two runs scored.
With 529 doubles, he tied Al Oliver for 23rd on the career list.
</P>
<P>
   Padres starter Sterling Hitchcock left in the fifth inning after
straining his left elbow. His status was unclear and he was due to
be examined Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu (2-4) refused to sign with the Padres after they acquired
him from a Japanese team in 1997, forcing a trade to the New York
Yankees. He was booed during introductions and his two plate
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu, acquired by the Expos from New York during the offseason,
defeated San Diego on April 9 at Montreal. This time, he allowed
five runs and eight hits in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock, just 1-4 in seven appearances against the Expos, gave
two runs and six hits in four-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Whiteside (2-0) pitched two scoreless innings and Brian
Boehringer, bothered for much of the season by a right shoulder
strain, made his first appearance since April 21.
</P>
<P>
   With the score 2-all in the third, Gwynn doubled to tie Cap
Anson and Frank Robinson for 24th place, then scored on a grounder
by Ryan Klesko, who agreed earlier in the day to an $18.75 million,
three-year contract extension through 2004,
</P>
<P>
   Eric Owens' RBI single and Al Martin's sacrifice fly made it 5-2
in the fourth, and Dave Magadan added an RBI single in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal took a 2-0 lead in the first on doubles by Geoff Blum,
Rondell White and Jose Vidro. San Diego tied it in the bottom half
on RBI singles by Klesko and Boone.
</P>
<P>
   Whiteside replaced Hitchcock with a 3-1 count on Blum with no
outs and one on in the fifth. Blum walked and Whiteside threw a
wild pitch, but Whiteside retired his next three batters.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Vidro is 7-for-16 against the Padres this season. ... San
Diego SS Damian Jackson has six errors in five games.

FBI Warns of New Computer Virus
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- AThe FBI said Friday night that a new and dangerous
computer virus dubbed ''Killer Resume'' is spreading through e-mail systems
using the Microsoft Outlook program. The virus is carried in a file attached to
an e-mail with the subject ''Resume - Janet Simons.'' The attachment is a

Mexican Candidates Debate
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- In a crucial debate Friday night ahead of a tight
presidential election, two opposition candidates lashed out at the party that
has ruled Mexico for 71 years, accusing it of leaving millions in poverty. Even
Francisco Labastida, candidate of the PRI -- the Institutional Revolutionary
Party -- called for ''profound changes'' in the tough free-market policies of
the last three presidents, to ''recover the essence of the popular spirit'' of
Mexico's revolution and to spread income more equitably. But he urged voters to
build on his party's accomplishments in office rather than make ''a leap into
the void'' with the opposition.

Shooting Breaks Out in Fiji
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- A gunbattle broke out Saturday between rebels who have
been trying for a week to seize power in Fiji and government troops, leaving two
soldiers and a journalist wounded. The shots were fired about one-quarter of a
mile from Parliament, where rebel leader George Speight and about 60 gunmen have
been holding Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and more than 30 members of his
government hostage. Chaudhry, elected last year, is the first leader of Fiji
from its ethnic Indian minority. Speight claims to be acting on behalf of the
Pacific island nation's majority ethnic Fijians, and wants to reduce the powers
that Indians can hold in the government.

Police: Student Kills Fla. Teacher

   LAKE WORTH, Fla. (AP) -- Police said a 13-year-old student who fatally shot a
teacher Friday with a semi-automatic pistol got the gun and bullets from a
dresser drawer at his grandfather's house last week. Seventh grader Nathaniel
Brazill was sent home from school for throwing water balloons on the last day of
classes and returned to Lake Worth Community Middle School shortly before 3:30
p.m., Police Chief William Smith said. He spoke to teacher Barry Grunow, pulled
out a .25-caliber pistol and fired a single shot, killing the 35-year-old
language arts teacher, he said. Brazill flagged down a police officer about a
quarter mile from the school and surrendered. Smith said police are considering
filing charges against the grandfather.

   HOUSTON (AP) -- A federal judge Friday set an Aug. 5 execution date for
convicted killer Juan Raul Garza, who would become the first federal prisoner
put to death in almost four decades. U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela's order
calls for Garza to be executed by injection at 6 a.m. at the federal death
chamber in Terre Haute, Ind. Garza, 43, who was convicted Brownsville, Texas, in
August 1993 for killing three men between April 1990 and January 1991, is among
20 inmates awaiting execution. Because of pending appeals, no other inmate has
an execution date. The last federal execution was in 1963.

<HEADLINE> EPA Orders Clean Up in Montana  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIBBY, Mont. (AP) --W.R. &AMP; Grace Co. has been ordered by the
Environmental Protection Agency to clean up a vermiculite
processing site contaminated with high levels of asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also plans to begin cleanup of a second processing
site connected to the now-closed vermiculite mine operated by Grace
until 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Grace is expected to foot the bill for the projects, which could
cost more than $5 million, an EPA official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Vermiculite is a mica-like material most commonly used in
horticulture for its ability to absorb water. It is also used as
insulation and as an asbestos substitute in brake shoes and
firewall liners in vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Recent EPA tests detected dangerous concentrations of asbestos
in soil, air and dust at the vermiculite processing sites.
</P>
<P>
   The cleanup of one of the sites formerly owned by Grace will
involve tearing down five buildings and removing up to 18 inches of
topsoil from 10 acres. Cleanup of the other, 26-acre site will
require the razing of eight buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Grace operated the Libby vermiculite mine north of town for 27
years. News reports last fall revealed almost 200 former miners and
family members have died of asbestos-related diseases, and 372
residents had been diagnosed with such illnesses.

<HEADLINE> NJ Teacher Suspended for Discipline  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKLIN TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) -- A math teacher has been suspended
for allowing a group of sixth-graders to take turns striking a
student who missed a homework assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Maxie Rivers was suspended with pay while Hillcrest School
officials investigate, said Michael Barrett, his attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The May 16 incident was ''light-hearted,'' Barrett said, and the
other youngsters merely ''tapped him kiddingly. Only his best
friend -- as best friends will -- punched him.''
</P>
<P>
   But ''Mr. Rivers sees in retrospect that this wasn't the best
way to reinforce the lesson,'' Barrett said.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor at the hospital where 11-year-old Aaron Lawton was
later taken by his father said the boy suffered bruises.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron said the teacher had singled him out for missing homework
in the past and came up with an idea a month ago to get him to turn
in his assignments.
</P>
<P>
   ''How about we make a bet? If you miss an assignment, the whole
class gets to deck you,'' Aaron quoted his teacher as saying. He
said he thought his teacher was joking.
</P>
<P>
   After Aaron missed the May 16 assignment, Rivers told the boy to
put his arms up, and boys and girls stood in line and punched him,
Aaron said. ''Some of the punches were hard, some were soft and
some were in between,'' the boy said.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron's father, Neil Lawton, said: ''That's like telling kids:
'Let's settle disputes with violence. I mean, push-ups I could
understand, but this?''

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Decry TV Violence, Sex  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Angered over sex and violence on television,
four senators are questioning whether the broadcast industry's
programming serves the public interest.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Federal Communications Commission, the
lawmakers decried what they called declining standards in
over-the-air television and its impact on young viewers.
</P>
<P>
   They questioned whether broadcasters, who enjoy free access to
the public airwaves, are in fact providing programming that
benefits the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The evidence is so compelling, and the risks to our children
so serious, that we are obliged to ask whether the broadcasters are
fulfilling their public trust,'' wrote Republican Sens. John McCain
of Arizona and Sam Brownback of Kansas and Democratic Sens. Joseph
Lieberman of Connecticut and Robert Byrd of West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Broadcasters declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   FCC Chairman William Kennard said, ''We will carefully review
(the senators') recommendations and look forward to the ensuing
dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   The FCC is considering how broadcasters can repay the public for
obtaining digital channels worth tens of billions of dollars
without charge from the government.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers say that as the FCC comes up with the ''price
tag'' for the free channels, it should look at the standards of
programming and whether instituting a voluntary ''good
programming'' code for broadcasters could better serve the public.
</P>
<P>
   The senators also said that when it comes to graphic content on
shows, broadcasters have appeared indifferent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The denials and excuses we routinely hear today from the
industry raise serious questions about the commitment of many
broadcasters to serving the public interest, as they are obligated
to do by law,'' they wrote Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The industry received some credit from the senators for its
''modest steps'' to reduce the amount of violence and gratuitous
murder aired during prime time.
</P>
<P>
   They noted as well that broadcasters have worked to implement a
content rating system to work with the v-chip, which allows parents
to block objectionable programming that contains sex, violence or
crude language.
</P>
<P>
   The senators also cited, however, a prevalence of sex and
vulgarity on broadcast television. They pointed to a Kaiser Family
Foundation survey that found 67 percent of the networks' prime-time
shows during the 1997-1998 season contained talk about sex or
sexual behavior, and 77 percent of prime-time situation comedies
contained sexual content.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, the lawmakers asked the FCC to review and clarify
its legal indecency standard, given ''the increasingly salacious
content now being aired.''
</P>
<P>
   The senators also raised the possibility of reviving an industry
programming code, which would amount to self-regulation, to
recognize the broadcasters' special responsibility to young
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC last December began an inquiry into the kinds of
obligations broadcasters would have, in exchange for getting the
digital channels for free.
</P>
<P>
   During the transition to digital, each of the nation's 1,600
television stations will get a second channel -- collectively valued
at billions of dollars. That way, existing television sets that
cannot receive the new signal will not be useless immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasters already have obligations in return for using analog
channels. Those include providing public affairs and educational
children's programs and making air time available to political
candidates at low rates.

<HEADLINE> Cape Hatteras Lighthouse Reopens  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUXTON, N.C. (AP) -- The hundreds of visitors who climbed the
spiral steel steps to the top of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse gazed
at a changed landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Atlantic Ocean nearly lapped at the base. But a
move undertaken last summer put the lighthouse in a maritime forest
1,600 feet away, protected from the pounding surf that had
threatened to topple the historic landmark.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was the first day it was reopened to the public.
</P>
<P>
   It was a great day to climb a lighthouse -- temperature in the
mid-70s under a brilliant blue sky -- but for some the new location
was disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I liked it by the ocean. It's something that takes a little
getting used to,'' said Jeanine Bajack, who has climbed the
lighthouse every year -- except 1999 when it was closed for moving.
</P>
<P>
   When it went into service in 1870, the lighthouse stood 1,600
feet from the ocean -- the same distance from the beach as now, but
over the decades erosion brought the ocean steadily closer.
</P>
<P>
   The lighthouse sat just 150 feet from the water before the move.
The National Park Service, which runs Cape Hatteras National
Seashore, worried a severe storm could topple the lighthouse from
its granite foundation.
</P>
<P>
   In June, a contractor jacked up the lighthouse and moved it on
rails pushed by hydraulic jacks 2,900 feet southwest. The move cost
$10 million.
</P>
<P>
   The lighthouse will be rededicated next May at a gathering of
descendants of Hatteras lighthouse keepers. A book of oral
histories about the lighthouse will be published to commemorate the
event.

<HEADLINE> 180 More U.N. Hostages Released  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Guerrillas have released 180 more
U.N. hostages in Sierra Leone, leaving fewer than 100 captives in
rebel hands, and President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah has announced plans
to prosecute the rebel leader.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. peacekeepers were handed over to authorities in Foya, a
border town in neighboring Liberia, according to a statement
released in the Liberian capital, Monrovia. Liberia said fewer than
100 of the original 500 hostages are still in rebel hands.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kabbah accused Revolutionary United Front leader
Foday Sankoh of committing serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This time around Sankoh will be prosecuted,'' Kabbah said in
comments carried on state radio and television -- the government's
first comment on his fate since the rebel leader's capture earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh was convicted of treason in 1998 and sentenced to death
but was later released from jail under the provisions of a peace
accord signed last July that was meant to end to civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Kabbah did not say what charges the rebel chief would face or
when a trial would be held. The government has said that any
prosecution would be for crimes that were committed after last
year's signing of the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   The government has been investigating Sankoh's role in the
deaths of 21 people at the hands of rebel gunmen during a protest
in front of his Freetown residence earlier this month, as well as
allegations that rebels have been involved in diamond smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. and human rights officials also charge that rebels have
continued to carry out killings and rapes in parts of Sierra Leone
that remain under their control.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh's rebels have reportedly demanded his freedom, and any
prosecution threatens to ignite further conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The developments came as the United Nations revealed that it
believes several mutilated corpses found this week in the
war-ravaged west African nation were the bodies of U.N.
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies are believed to be four Zambians and one or two
Nigerians, U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst said. They were badly
decomposed when found Monday, and in some cases only whitened bones
remained.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has been collecting information from the
various forces who had fighters in the area near Rogberi Junction,
about 50 miles east of the capital, Freetown, where there was a May
6 battle between U.N. peacekeepers and RUF rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Four Zambian and two Nigerian soldiers were reported missing
after the battle, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were discovered not far from where Associated Press
Television News cameraman Miguel Gil Moreno de Mora and Reuters
correspondent Kurt Schork were killed Wednesday in a rebel ambush.
South African cameraman Mark Chisholm and Greek photographer Yannis
Behrakis suffered light injuries in the same attack.
</P>
<P>
   In his broadcast comment, Kabbah expressed his sorrow to the
families of the two slain journalists and to those of the two
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ''These men were not involved in any fighting but were trying to
bring out the facts for the whole world to know,'' Kabbah said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels killed tens of thousands of Sierra Leoneons and
intentionally mutilated many more during the civil war. The
conflict reignited earlier this month when the RUF took the U.N.
peacekeepers hostage and began advancing toward Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, an alliance of pro-government forces has been
pushing the rebels away from the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch accused the RUF of imposing a ''reign of
terror'' during its weeklong occupation of the area around Masiaka,
45 miles east of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel fighters abducted, raped, killed and mutilated civilians
in the area before they were repelled more than a week ago by
pro-government forces, the international group said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have also been looting and destroying homes, and
forcibly recruiting civilians, U.N. human rights official Richard
Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   There were also reports of beatings and slayings by
pro-government forces. Both sides have been re-enlisting child
fighters, some as young as 10, Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of civilians have fled their homes. More than 35,000
people have poured into Freetown alone since the beginning of May.
Up to 10,000 other people have gathered on an island just north
Freetown after fleeing violence, Eckhard said.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Candidates Debate  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- After months of seeming to criticize his own
party's 71-year record in power, presidential candidate Francisco
Labastida is now embracing it.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders called the shift -- highlighted during a
crucial debate Friday night -- an act of desperation in a fading
campaign. Vicente Fox of the National Action Party has pulled about
even with Labastida in most polls before the July 2 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida, of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party,
or PRI, has spent much of his campaign countering opposition
demands for change with a message suggested by a top adviser,
Clintonite James Carville: ''change with a course.''
</P>
<P>
   He has called himself the champion of a ''New PRI'' and pledged
to embrace the millions of Mexicans he says the government has long
ignored -- a clear criticism of his own party, which has held the
presidency since 1929.
</P>
<P>
   But during Friday's debate, probably the last before the
elections, Labastida instead emphasized the accomplishments of the
PRI and charged that an opposition government would be a ''leap
into the void.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I propose that we consolidate what we Mexicans have achieved
over many years,'' he said. ''Consolidate the climate of freedom,
consolidate democracy, consolidate the advances in terms of
education and health that the country has had.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposition candidates reacted with skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would just stress the enormous doubt that we can move the
country ahead ... with the same people who caused the crisis and
who have brought us into this economic disaster,'' said Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas of the center-left Democratic Revolution Party.
</P>
<P>
   He spent much of the debate stressing Labastida's ties to former
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the most reviled man in Mexico
since his term ended with an economic collapse in 1994. Cardenas
read from a 1992 speech in which Labastida gushed praise for
Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   And both Fox and Cardenas stressed the PRI's failings.
</P>
<P>
   ''You need firm character and true leadership to end 70 years of
corruption, poverty and desperation,'' said Fox, who is often
accused of stubbornness.
</P>
<P>
   ''The PRI has turned our country into a factory of poverty and
of the poor,'' added Cardenas, who is a distant third in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Fox political coordinator Alberto Perez called Labastida's move
toward embracing the PRI an act of desperation.
</P>
<P>
   ''In his ads he talks about the millions of Mexicans the
government hasn't been able to help. And now he says they've been
helped,'' Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   Most polls indicated that Labastida did poorly during a first
debate in April, and he has been slipping in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Aides have blamed Carville for errors in the first debate and
said the U.S. adviser had been kept out of preparation for this
one. Labastida retreated with aides to a country house in the state
of Morelos.
</P>
<P>
   Top Labastida aide Javier Trevino said the candidate has been
focusing on the PRI's accomplishments for the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's saying: 'Look, we PRI members have also been responsible
for everything good in the country.' You have to give us that,''
Trevino said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida did call for ''profound changes'' in the tough
free-market policies of the last three presidents, to ''recover the
essence of the popular spirit'' of Mexico's revolution and to
spread income more equitably.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has campaigned largely on toppling the ruling party and
ending corruption, promising a broad-based government and a
free-market economy.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas favors a larger state role and greater rights for
Mexico under free trade treaties, though he says he would keep
industry in private hands.
</P>
<P>
   All three men are former governors: Fox of Guanajuato, Labastida
of Sinaloa and Cardenas of Michoacan. Fox also has been a Coca-Cola
executive; Labastida was Mexico's powerful interior secretary;
Cardenas was Mexico City's mayor.

<HEADLINE> Dancers Compete To Be Rockettes  </HEADLINE>
By ANGIE WAGNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Linda Haberman scans the room filled with
dancers in colorful leotards, searching for the select few who can
make eye-high kicks look easy and perform intricate routines in
unison.
</P>
<P>
   A girl in neon green catches her eye. Kicks are good, so is the
smile. Could she be the next Radio City Rockette?
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to be able to pick up quickly,'' said Haberman,
director of choreography for the Rockettes' Christmas show.
</P>
<P>
   Some 79 young dancers showed up Friday at a Las Vegas dance
studio, hoping to earn a spot on the Rockette line-up. By the end
of the day, only nine were left.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to be able to do exactly what we're asking,''
Haberman told the dancers. ''That's what the Rockettes are about.''
</P>
<P>
   This year marks the 75th anniversary of the Radio City Rockettes
-- and every dancer at the audition here wants to be a part of the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of girls here,'' said Karin Townson, 23, who
performs in the show ''Footloose'' at the Rio hotel-casino.
''You're trying to blend in as opposed to standing out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockettes have to be from 5 feet 5{ to 5 feet 10 inches tall and
be skilled in jazz, tap and ballet. Plus they must be able to put
on a bright smile while performing complicated routines.
</P>
<P>
   Haberman and her assistants have seen 750 dancers during this
year's audition tour that included New York, Los Angeles, Dallas,
Orlando, Fla., Pittsburgh and Toronto. Las Vegas was the last stop
and, for some of the girls, the last chance to make this year's
cut.
</P>
<P>
   Haberman said some dancers who weren't accepted in one city
traveled to the next audition, hoping one more chance would make
the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 750 dancers, only 145 were called back. Those that make
it through a final audition will perform in this year's Radio City
Christmas Spectacular in six cities -- New York, Chicago, Detroit,
Myrtle Beach, S.C., Branson, Mo. and Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   In Las Vegas, dancers filled the waiting room at the Fern Adair
Conservatory of Arts. Some stretched and practiced dance moves,
others waited quietly for their names to be called.
</P>
<P>
   In just minutes, the dancers were expected to memorize routines
as a piano player banged out Christmas music. The ones who were
slow to learn the steps or didn't have good technique were cut
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Others were eliminated because they lacked stage presence.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's go over it one more time,'' Haberman yelled to the
dancers after teaching them a routine. ''You have to be very, very
special to be a Rockette.''

<HEADLINE> Jesse Jackson Blocked From Decatur  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KELLY
<TEXT>
<P>
   DECATUR, Ill. (AP) -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson may not have
attended high school commencement ceremonies here, but his presence
was felt by at least two of the graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt Fuller and Gregory Howell -- who Jackson helped get
into an alternative school after they and four others were expelled
last fall -- graduated Friday night after months of racial tension
and turmoil in this central Illinois town.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it wasn't for him, this day wouldn't have come,'' Fuller
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, invited to the graduations of both young men by their
families, was forbidden from attending because he led protests last
fall over the expulsions of the six students.
</P>
<P>
   In an emergency hearing Friday, a Macon County judge upheld his
prior ruling that Jackson and other Rainbow/PUSH Coalition
protesters could not come within 50 feet of the city's three high
schools without permission.
</P>
<P>
   School administrators argued that Jackson's presence would take
the spotlight off the graduates and could spark unrest.
</P>
<P>
   After the judge's ruling, Jackson backed off his threat to
challenge the injunction by attending the ceremonies. Instead, he
announced he would leave on a planned trip to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ''In no way does he want to let the Decatur school board use him
as a diversion to the graduation of these students,'' Rainbow/PUSH
spokeswoman Macy Morales said.
</P>
<P>
   Other coalition leaders decided against trying to attend the
commencement exercises as an act of civil disobedience. Instead,
they gathered at a church to congratulate Fuller and Howell and to
honor their parents and others who supported them as they worked
toward graduation.
</P>
<P>
   There were no demonstrations at any of the three high schools
Friday night. When Howell was introduced at Eisenhower, the crowd
cheered and many of the graduating seniors stood to applaud.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy began when a brawl broke out in the stands
during a high school football game Sept. 17. Six students involved
in the videotaped melee were expelled, and criminal charges were
filed against four, including Fuller and Howell.
</P>
<P>
   The case sparked a national debate over zero-tolerance policies
on violence in schools and brought Jackson and his supporters to
this central Illinois town to protest.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit Judge James Hendrian permanently banned the protesters
from campus in March, agreeing with school administrators that
demonstrations had disrupted classes.
</P>
<P>
   Rainbow/PUSH leaders contended that the court order was not
applicable to graduation ceremonies, and Jackson said on Wednesday
that he planned to attend at the invitation of Fuller and Howell
despite the school board's threats to have him arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson had helped to pressure the district to put the pair in
an alternative school so they could graduate with their classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Rainbow/PUSH asked Hendrian for the hearing on whether the
injunction applied to graduation ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson faces criminal charges for last fall's protests and is
out of jail on a $10,000 bond. One condition of his bond is that he
not go on school grounds.

<HEADLINE> Gore Denounces Bush Security Plan  </HEADLINE>
By DARLENE SUPERVILLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAHWAH, N.J. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore says George W. Bush's
''wildly optimistic'' plan to pursue a missile defense system and
slash the U.S. nuclear arsenal while opposing a worldwide ban on
nuclear weapons testing amounts to ''a formula ... for a reignited
arms race.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first public comments on the proposals by his Republican
presidential rival, Gore argued Friday for a more limited
antimissile defense system that he said would protect the nation
without forcing it to break the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Texas Gov. Bush proposed cutting the
nuclear arsenal to its ''lowest possible number consistent with our
national security,'' even without Russia's approval. He said the
cuts would be part of a broad national security review that must
include a missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who was delivering the commencement address today at the
U.S. Military Academy in nearby West Point, N.Y., said Bush's
approach was wrong for the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any effort to go back in time to the Star Wars proposal ...
is, in the opinion of most experts that have talked about it,
wildly optimistic,'' the Democratic presidential contender told
reporters aboard Air Force Two as it flew to New York from a
campaign appearance in Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm persuaded by their arguments.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said ''engineering uncertainties'' and the cost of the
space-based defense system first championed by President Reagan led
the country to abandon course years ago, though some defense hawks
in Congress have continued to push for some kind of missile defense
program.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Gore contended that after Bush had paid for his
proposed tax cuts and Social Security reforms ''there wouldn't be
any money for Star Squabbles much less Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's objections to a U.S. missile defense system date to the
days when Reagan pushed for one. The Russians have said they will
put all arms control treaties on hold if the United States violates
or withdraws from the 1972 ABM treaty, which bans national missile
defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he is willing to scrap the pact to make room for
the development of technology that could protect the country
against missile strikes from a growing number of nuclear threats.
</P>
<P>
   The topic of further arms reductions is expected to be discussed
during next week's summit in Moscow between President Clinton and
Russian President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also noted Bush's opposition to a treaty -- rejected by the
Senate in 1999 -- banning testing of nuclear weapons worldwide.
Critics said it would compromise national security. Gore has said
he will resubmit the treaty to the Senate if elected president.
Russia ratified the treaty earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you kill the Comprehensive Test Ban treaty that our country
wrote and negotiated all over the world and give the green light to
more nuclear testing all over the world and then send the signal
that we're going to concentrate not on deterring an attack with
retaliation but rather this hugely, expensive Star Wars approach,
then that is a formula for encouraging more offensive missiles
aimed at the United States, more nuclear testing around the world
and a reignited arms race,'' said Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Of Bush's support for a grand missile defense system and
opposition to the treaty, Gore said: ''In my opinion, that's not a
responsible course.''
</P>
<P>
   He said shrinking the nuclear arsenal alone won't make the
nation more secure, and that deterrence also is an important part
of the equation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reductions have to be carried out in a way that reduces the
risk of confrontation,'' Gore said, suggesting that his opponent's
approach would increase the odds for conflict. ''If you're not
careful, you could have fewer missiles and a more dangerous
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the graduating cadets weren't likely to hear Gore
criticize Bush. While he said he planned to speak about this very
topic, national defense and strategic weapons policy, his
appearance is billed as an official vice presidential visit -- not a
political campaign stop.

<HEADLINE> Navy Stops Controversial Sonar Test  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Navy says it won't perform controversial
high-volume sonar tests that could be harmful to whales and other
marine life when it conducts a military exercise off the New Jersey
coast.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists welcomed the decision which marks an
escalation in a dispute over whether an effort by the Navy to test
and deploy advanced underwater detection systems is dangerous to
the huge mammals.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement reported in The Washington Post on Saturday, the
Navy said its Littoral Warfare Advanced Development test 45 miles
offshore will go ahead this coming week but will ''not include
active acoustic sources.''
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists believe that whales and other marine mammals can
be harmed by the extremely high-decibel sounds emitted by the
Navy's new sonar systems. The animals rely on their hearing for
navigation and can suffer hearing loss and other problems because
of the sonar noise, which can be greater than a 747 jetliner at
takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, a dozen whales beached themselves in the Bahamas
a day after the Navy used the intense sonar in exercises there.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Commerce Department's National Marine
Fisheries Service sent a letter to the Office of Naval Research
complaining that the Navy's assessment of potential environmental
damage was inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Reynolds, an official with the Natural Resources Defense
Council, said the Navy's decision to cancel the tests marks a
significant change.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think this in very important because the Navy has now been
told it cannot simply reserve a vessel, schedule an exercise and
proceed without worry of environmental impacts when dealing with
low-frequency sonar systems,'' he told the Post.

he had fired the country's democratically elected government and would appoint a
new caretaker administration by Monday. He also said rebel leader George Speight

from prosecution for their roles in the coup attempt. The announcement signaled
that Mara was caving in to two of Speight's three main demands. But Mara did not

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new and dangerous computer virus has surfaced on

The virus is carried in a file attached to an e-mail with the subject ''Resume -
Janet Simons.'' The attachment is a Microsoft Word file called ''EXPLORER.DOC''
or ''RESUME.DOC,'' according to an alert posted on the Web site of Network
Associates, a computer security company. If a computer user opens the
attachment, the virus will spread itself by sending an e-mail to everyone in the
user's e-mail address book, the company said. When the user closes the Word

Francisco Labastida, candidate of the PRI -- the Institutional Revolutionary
Party -- called for ''profound changes'' in the tough free-market policies of
the last three presidents, to ''recover the essence of the popular spirit'' of
Mexico's revolution and to spread income more equitably. But he urged voters to

<HEADLINE> Fiji's President Fires Government  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Fijian President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara said
Saturday that he had fired the country's democratically elected
government and would appoint a new caretaker administration by
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He also said rebel leader George Speight and six gunmen who
stormed parliament on May 19 would likely be granted immunity from
prosecution for their roles in the coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The move came just hours after a gunfight broke out between
soldiers and rebels at a roadblock outside parliament in which two
soldiers and a journalist were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Mara said the timing of his announcement was not related to the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement signaled that Mara was caving in to two of
Speight's three main demands. But Mara did not give in to the third
demand -- that he resign as president.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest offer to Speight in an attempt to bring an end
to the hostage standoff at parliament. Speight, who has declared
himself prime minister and appointed his own cabinet, did not
immediately react.
</P>
<P>
   Mara, a figurehead in the elected government, has been the
country's acting leader since the coup began and he declared a
state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, shots were fired between government soldiers
and rebels holding Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and more than
30 members of his government hostage in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry, who was elected prime minister last year, is the first
leader of Fiji from its ethnic Indian minority. Speight claims to
be acting on behalf of the Pacific island nation's majority ethnic
Fijians, and wants to reduce the powers that Indians can have in
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's shootout with military forces, the first since the
takeover began May 19, occurred after about 200 supporters of the
coup and at least three armed rebels left the parliamentary
compound and confronted about eight soldiers at a roadblock.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to remove the roadblock, the rebel supporters tried
to grab the soldiers' weapons and pushed one of them to the ground.
The other soldiers fired warning shots. The rebels shot back,
setting off a brief gunbattle before both groups dispersed.
</P>
<P>
   Two soldiers and a cameraman for Associated Press Television
News were wounded. Officials said one soldier was hit in the
shoulder and the other in the leg. Jerry Harmer, 38, of Britain, a
senior producer and cameraman for Associated Press Television News,
was shot in the right wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at Suva's Colonial War Memorial hospital said Harmer's
condition was good.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers withdrew and were chased by the rebels, who threw
rocks and tore down tents erected at the checkpoint. The rebels
stopped their charge at a second checkpoint, which had been
abandoned by police when the shooting started, and they eventually
returned to Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The clash came a day after scores of Fijians rushed into the
parliamentary compound to support the rebels, flooding past
military barricades to join them.
</P>
<P>
   The leading defector was Maj. Josefa Savua, the brother of
Fiji's Police Commissioner Isikia Savua. He said he joined the
rebels ''because I am a Fijian. I want a future for my children.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This might be the beginning,'' said rebel spokesman Simione
Taikani. ''The police might come. Everybody might come.''
</P>
<P>
   In another development, a committee of the Great Council of
Chiefs -- the supreme body representing Fiji's various tribal
royalty -- re-entered negotiations on Friday with Speight to try to
end the eight-day crisis.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-hour meeting, the chief's committee spokesman, Epeli
Kanaimaii, reported no agreement and said meetings would resume
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Speight, who was not involved in the shootout, blamed the
confrontation on Mara's decision to bolster security around the
compound with military checkpoints, in addition to police
checkpoints set up last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want the army to be deployed, restricting the movement
of people and the free access of people who wish to come and go as
they please,'' Speight told a news conference inside the compound
after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   He said he authorized his men to remove the roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I authorize, tacitly, any action that our security forces feel
is necessary in order to remove a threat from the perimeter of this
complex,'' Speight said.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Isikia Savua announced Friday that he had
handed over security around Parliament to the army because armed
men from the compound had been approaching checkpoints at night and
threatening officers. Fiji's police do not carry guns.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations and foreign governments including the United
States, Britain, Australia and New Zealand have criticized the
tribal leaders for not cracking down on Speight and his backers.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said the chiefs
had 48 hours to support the democratically elected government or
face economic and political sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Speight is a terrorist -- this is an act of terror,''
Downer said in Canberra.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji is located in the Pacific 2,250 miles northeast of Sydney,
Australia. Ethnic Indians make up 44 percent of the population of
813,000, while indigenous Fijians account for 51 percent.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Counties Scramble For Flags  </HEADLINE>
By MARYCLAIRE DALE
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Widows, veterans and patriotic volunteers
look forward all year to Memorial Day weekend, when they decorate
their loved ones' graves with American flags.
</P>
<P>
   This year, delays and a bankruptcy in the flag manufacturing
industry may mean that the tradition will be put on hold in some
Pennsylvania counties.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a big deal with veterans, the flag. Not only for war
vets, but for every veteran that served his county,'' said Joe
Columbus, Cambria County veterans affairs director.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania law mandates that all counties provide veterans'
graves each year with a flag, most of which are distributed before
Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus started worrying when his order for more than 43,000
flags failed to arrive by the April 5 delivery date. He gave
Collegeville Flag and Banner Co. another two weeks to send them.
And then two more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   With Memorial Day fast approaching, and veterans groups
clamoring for their flags, Columbus scurried to find another
supplier -- and in the meantime filed a lawsuit against
Collegeville.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me tell you what -- we sweated every day since April,''
Columbus said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute rush order for the 12-by-16-inch flags from
another company cost the county $10,000 more than the $21,000 bid
price they had agreed to with Collegeville.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Doyle, president of Collegeville Flag, said the delays were
largely due to problems with a material supplier.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a year of record flag consumption. Every so many years
-- and they tend to be election years -- demand tends to go up,''
Doyle said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the bankruptcy of U.S. Flag Manufacturing Inc. in
Quincy, Mass., which specialized in cemetery-sized flags, sent a
ripple through the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle said there are only a handful of flag manufacturers in the
United States. He said his company is negotiating a settlement with
Cambria County.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer County had found itself with the same dilemma until some
frenzied efforts by businessmen and county officials.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week Jim Smartz, the county's director of veterans
affairs, announced that flags for the 14,000 graves wouldn't be
available because Collegeville couldn't deliver them.
</P>
<P>
   The county has ordered flags from Collegeville for Memorial Day
for 30 years, but the company canceled Mercer County's order last
week.
</P>
<P>
   So cemetery owner Tom Flynn, and his son John, who owns a
funeral home, started calling people in Pennsylvania and elsewhere
in search of flags. Smartz started working the phones, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Reynolds Veterans of Foreign Wars post had enough stockpiled
flags to cover its four cemeteries. The Flynns found 4,000 flags,
and Smartz found 4,300.
</P>
<P>
   That still wasn't enough. Other Mercer County businesses stepped
forward to help, and Lawrence, Venango and Butler counties donated
extra flags to the cause.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's kind of how counties work together, but this was such a
large amount, we weren't sure we'd be able to pull it together,''
said Mercer County Commissioner Olivia Lazor.
</P>
<P>
   In Pittsburgh, Allegheny County officials had ordered their
annual supply of flags -- 158,000 -- from the company that went
bankrupt, and likewise found themselves working the phones, trying
to round up replacements.
</P>
<P>
   The county obtained smaller lots from a few flagmakers, but were
still 44,000 short. A Pittsburgh area retailer helped them fill the
gap at the last minute -- and at a higher cost. The flags arrived
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes the low bidder is not the best (choice),'' said
Michael Murphy of the county's veterans affairs office, which
spends nearly $100,000 a year on the flags.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish I had a million dollars. I'd start my own company, and
stockpile a million flags,'' he said.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Two men, one with a history of robbing fast-food
joints, were jailed overnight and awaited arraignment today in the

others who had been bound, gagged, and shot execution-style.
</P>

   John ''Benji'' Taylor, 36, was arrested at his sister-in-law's
house in Brentwood, Long Island, some 30 miles from the crime
scene; Craig Godineaux, 31, was picked up at a men's clothing store

night's grisly murder-robbery at the restaurant in Flushing,
Queens, said First Deputy Police Commissioner Patrick Kelleher on

   Two men survived the attack. One was released from the hospital
Thursday and was in protective custody, while the other was listed
in critical condition after undergoing surgery for a gunshot wound
to the head.
</P>
<P>
   Police lifted Taylor's palm print from a box as they sifted
through evidence in the bloody basement where Taylor and Godineaux
allegedly corralled seven Wendy's workers before shooting them on
the floor of a walk-in refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was arrested in Brentwood by Suffolk County police
responding to a bicycle accident in front of the home where he was
hiding out, Kelleher said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had a weapon in a fanny pack that was in his possession, a
.380-caliber semiautomatic,'' he said, adding that the gun may have
been used in the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Two sources close to the investigation said a canvas bag with
some of the $2,400 stolen from the restaurant was also recovered at
the house, along with a missing surveillance tape. They said the
tape does not show the murders, but does show the suspects entering
the Wendy's.
</P>
<P>
   A tip to CrimeStoppers led NYPD detectives to Taylor. A
high-ranking police official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the city police asked Suffolk County cops on their way to the
bicycle accident to help. Taylor was standing outside around 4:30
p.m. Friday watching the commotion when police picked him up.
</P>
<P>
   ''They went up to him and said, 'What's your name? And he said
'Benji,' and they grabbed him,''' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Both men face multiple counts of first- and second-degree
murder, robbery and weapons charges, said Queens District Attorney
Richard A. Brown. He could seek the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The two suspects were expected to be arraigned in Queens
Criminal Court today.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was already wanted on an outstanding warrant. He was
arrested on June 23, 1999, for robbing a Queens McDonald's
restaurant where he once worked. The warrant was issued when he
missed a court date. He was already on probation for the 1996
burglary of yet another McDonald's, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor worked at the Wendy's briefly in 1999, and left under
suspicion because some money was missing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was an internal investigation -- he was never charged with
any criminal activities,'' Kelleher said.
</P>
<P>
   The five workers killed in the shooting were identified by
police as Ramon Nazario, 44, of Queens; Anita C. Smith, 23, of
Queens; Jeremy Ryan Mele, 18, of Neptune, N.J.; Ali Ibadat, 40, of
Queens; and Jean Auguste, 27, of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Auguste was the manager and the gunmen asked for him by name
when they came to the restaurant around closing time, 11 p.m.
Wednesday. They went to his basement office, then Auguste used an
intercom to summon the six employees downstairs.
</P>
<P>
   Auguste was a Haitian immigrant who became a U.S. citizen two
years ago. He had recently gotten engaged.
</P>
<P>
   Nazario worked at the Wendy's with his 41-year-old sister,
Maritza, who was off Wednesday. He liked to barbecue and dance,
said his brother, Benjamin.
</P>
<P>
   Mele graduated last year from Neptune High School and was active
in the ROTC program. Ibadat worked seven days a week to send money
home to his wife and children in his native Pakistan. Smith was to
start classes at York College in Queens in the fall. Her family
said she wanted to major in social work and was training to work
with disabled children.
</P>
<P>
   A sixth man, 23-year-old Patrick Castro, was shot through both
cheeks but was able to free himself two hours later, call 911, and
drag another survivor upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   That man, JaQuione Johnson, 18, remained in critical condition
at New York Hospital Medical Center on Friday. Johnson had been
thinking about joining the Marines, and raps in a group called
Family 4 Life with his brothers and cousins. He lives with his aunt
in the Jamaica section of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy's officials and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced the
creation of an Employees Relief Fund to help the families of the
victims. A single fund will be established and divided among the
seven families.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy's had offered a $50,000 reward and the city $10,000 for
information leading to the arrest and conviction of the persons
responsible.
</P>
<P>
   --------
</P>
<P>
   Editor's note: Anyone wishing to contribute to the victims'
families can send a check to: Wendy's Employees Relief Fund,
Mayor's Community Assistance Unit, 51 Chambers St., Room 630, New
York, N.Y., 10007.

<HEADLINE> Guatemalans Probe Personal Files  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY -- When lawyer Amilhar Camney met with three men
he was defending on military charges in 1981, someone was watching.
When professor Carlos Gomez dismissed class early and headed to a
rally in 1983, someone was watching.
</P>
<P>
   Their names, along with more than 650,000 others, are on a list
of citizens the Guatemalan government spied on over three decades
of dictatorship and civil war -- a top-secret military archive that
last week was opened to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, doctors and street vendors, bus drivers and human
rights leaders have flocked to a phone booth-like cubical in the
office of Guatemala's Human Rights Prosecutor to peer at a computer
screen and see whether they were among those being watched.
</P>
<P>
   They've been coming at a rate of 500 a day since May 11 -- and
seven of every 10 who come find their names on the list.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a physiological shock to see your name flash up there,''
said Sonya Puraz, a reporter for an Internet news provider who was
once active in a leftist student group. ''I knew I was probably on
some kind of blacklist, but when you see yourself there in black
and white it really hits you hard.''
</P>
<P>
   When printed out, the list -- first and last names followed by a
numbered code -- is thicker than the Guatemala City phone book. It's
not known if the presumed files corresponding to the numbers still
exist.
</P>
<P>
   Diego Mario Chamay, an official with the Human Rights
Prosecutor's office who used to do case work on the streets of
Guatemala City, now spends his days helping hundreds of Guatemalans
use one of three computers to search the list.
</P>
<P>
   ''The office is full of everyday folks looking to see if they
have a file,'' he said. ''I think some of the big opposition
leaders and dissenters know they have a file and don't come to see
it. But for the rest, it is worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those listed are Roman Catholic Bishop Juan Gerardi, who
was beaten to death in 1998, two days after issuing a report that
blamed the military for the vast majority of the 200,000 civilian
deaths in Guatemala's 36-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Also listed is Helen Mack, who began a human rights organization
after her sister was killed by soldiers in 1990 while doing
anthropological research among civil war refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Guatemala City lawyer Camney, archive number 402055, was 26
years old when he represented the three clients accused of military
crimes he didn't want to disclose.
</P>
<P>
   ''You grow up believing you are free, and then you find out
about something like this,'' said Camney, who said he once had a
police chief in the quiet colonial town of Antigua tell him to keep
his distance from his clients ''for his own safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Days after that meeting, Camney said, one of the men he was
representing disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The Guatemalan military has refused to comment on the archive, a
list that seems eerily thorough for a country the size of Iowa with
a population of only 8 million. It also has refused to say whether
it has the files corresponding to listed numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But Edgar Gutierrez, a former human rights leader and key player
in publishing the truth commission report that Bishop Gerardi
presented, recently became head of the Secretariat of Strategic
Analysis -- the military arm that compiled the archive.
</P>
<P>
   ''For a long time the state has seen its own people as enemies.
A democracy can't function like that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got entire families listed in this file,'' he said.
''What could a 1- or 2-year-old baby ever do to anyone that would
put him on a list like that?''
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez said he was cooperating with state prosecutors who are
investigating whether keeping such a file was illegal. Though he
said things in the Strategic Secretariat have changed since he took
the reins, he could not guarantee that even more files don't exist.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no way to know how many of these kinds of things there
were until we find them all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez, the private-college law professor, said the names of
every member of his family appear on the list, including his uncle
who vanished in late 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many of the names you find on those lists are people who were
very worried about their country,'' Gomez said. ''It appears their
country was worried about them too.''

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Warns Israel on Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
By HUSSEIN DAKROUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   BINT JBEIL, Lebanon (AP) -- The triumphant leader of Hezbollah
guerillas says its too early to retire the Katushya rockets that
his forces periodically fired into Israel in its campaign to drive
Israeli troops off Lebanese soil.
</P>
<P>
   Standing before 30,000 cheering supporters in this former
Israeli stronghold in southern Lebanon, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah
warned Israel would pay a ''high price,'' for any aggression
against its northern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are today in Bint Jbeil safe and happy, and they are in
the northern settlements of Palestine along all the border
terrified before an unknown future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians should take heart from this week's chaotic
departure of Israeli forces from the security zone they occupied in
southern Lebanon and renew their own armed struggle to recover
lands they claim, Nasrallah said.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in front of Lebanon's flag and a banner that carried
the number 1,276 -- the total of Hezbollah guerrillas killed in the
fighting, Nasrallah urged Palestinians not to wait for the
international community to help advance their struggle, and
demanded Arab leaders renew isolation of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''In order to liberate your land you don't need tanks and
planes. With the example of martyrs you can impose your demands on
the Zionist aggressors,'' he said. ''Israel may own nuclear weapons
and heavy weaponry but, by God, it is weaker than a spider's web.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh God, oh God preserve Nasrallah for us!'' shouted the crowd
gathered in a stadium and surrounding streets.
</P>
<P>
   Since Israel's final departure Wednesday -- six weeks ahead of
its self-imposed July 7 deadline -- Arab officials and media have
showered praise on Hezbollah. Supporters of the Islamic militant
group Hamas in the West Bank town of Nablus lauded Hezbollah during
a march Friday to support Palestinian prisoners on hunger strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, however, said Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak had ordered a withdrawal from Lebanon because
he wanted peace, not because guerrillas forced Israel out.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you want to tell me that Barak gave the instruction to
withdraw because of Hezbollah?'' Arafat scoffed during a rare
interview Thursday with Israel's Channel Two television.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the frontier, U.N. officials using
satellite dishes to determine exact coordinates drove blue poles
into the ground to stake out Israel's new border with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   From the coastal town of Rosh Hanikra to the communal farm of
Malkhia 24 miles to the east, the U.N. border markings matched
Israel's drawing of the border several weeks ago. The work was to
continue Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. teams also fanned out in south Lebanon to ensure Israel has
withdrawn completely and the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army has
been dismantled. Verification is needed for the deployment of a
peacekeeping force along the border to go ahead.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Friday in New York that
he expects to have the certification of Israel's withdrawal ''in
the next few days.''
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers blocked scores of curious Israelis on Friday from
approaching a strip of border between Metulla and the Lebanese
village of Kfar Kila, where about 100 demonstrators on the Lebanese
side threw rocks and a firebomb over the fence.
</P>
<P>
   The firebomb started a bush fire that was put out by Israeli
soldiers. Over the past two days, Lebanese civilians have screamed
insults at Israeli soldiers guarding their side and hurled
firebombs, glass bottles and fruit in their direction.

<HEADLINE> Giants 5, Cubs 3  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Mark Gardner came within two outs of his
first shutout in nearly two years and Ellis Burks had three hits
and three RBIs as the San Francisco Giants beat the Chicago Cubs
5-3 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner (3-2), who has shuttled between the bullpen and the
starting rotation this season, struck out two and walked none while
starting in place of the disabled Joe Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed six hits and was replaced by Robb Nen after allowing
a two-run homer to Henry Rodriguez with one out in the ninth. Nen
allowed a two-out homer to Jose Nieves before finishing.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner's last shutout came Aug. 14, 1998, when he blanked
Florida 10-0.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Martinez, inserted into the starting lineup when first
baseman J.T. Snow was scratched because of a right eye irritation,
homered for the Giants, who have won 11 of their last 13 games at
Pacific Bell Park after dropping seven of their first eight games
at the new bayside stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Bonds went 2-for-3 with a walk and two runs scored,
staying hot since his return from an acute back strain last Friday.
He has gone 12-for-20 with five doubles and four homers in that
span.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Tapani (2-6) went seven innings, allowing five runs and
nine hits. He struck out nine and walked two but the Cubs failed in
their bid to win consecutive games for the first time since May
2-3.
</P>
<P>
   The first six batters to face Tapani all reached base via hit or
walk, though leadoff batter Marvin Benard was caught stealing
before Martinez connected for his second homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds doubled and Jeff Kent walked ahead of RBI singles by Burks
and Bill Mueller that put San Francisco up 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Burks added a two-out, two-run double in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Cubs made a series of roster moves before the game,
placing SS Ricky Gutierrez on the 15-day DL and recalling INF Chad
Meyers and reliever Matt Karchner from Triple-A Iowa. The Cubs also
released right-handed reliever Brian Williams and re-called
right-handed reliever Tim Worrell. ... Tapani has worked at least
seven innings in each of his last five starts. ... Kent, who
usually plays second, played first base in Snow's place, and
Martinez played at second.

<HEADLINE> Witness: I Saw Lewis Kick Victim  </HEADLINE>
By CHAD ROEDEMEIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Four days into a murder trial, jurors finally
heard a witness testify football star Ray Lewis was involved in a
fight that led to two stabbing deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Chester Anderson testified Friday that he saw Lewis kick a small
man who was lying on an Atlanta street as nightclubs started to
close the morning after the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who admitted to using about 30 different names and
stealing the identification of about seven people, was using former
pro football player Bam Morris' NFL identification to get into
Super Bowl parties free.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was walking with friends from another bar when he
came upon the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, the leading tackler in the NFL last season, is charged
with murder along with friends Reginald Oakley and Joseph Sweeting
in the deaths of Jacinth Baker and Richard Lollar. Even if he
didn't stab the victims, Lewis could be convicted of murder if he
was involved in the fight that led to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' lawyer Ed Garland attacked Anderson's credibility,
pointing out that he has a long criminal record and a federal
indictment for fraud pending in Arkansas. Garland also suggested
Anderson was testifying in hopes of winning leniency in his pending
legal problems -- a claim Anderson denied.
</P>
<P>
   ''Would you know the truth if you bumped into it?'' Garland
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he waited several weeks to come forward because of
a promise he made to friends he was with on the night of Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we left the scene, we had a mutual agreement not to say
anything,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution called Bruno DiSiena, a Cleveland restaurant
owner, to corroborate Anderson's story. DiSiena told the jury he
spent the weekend hanging out with Anderson, who he thought was a
Kansas City Chiefs football player named Byron. DiSiena said
Anderson told him he saw Lewis kicking someone as they walked past
the scene of the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said he planned to
call other witnesses to buttress Anderson's statement when the
trial resumes Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got some other witnesses who (Anderson) also told about
this incident, and I think once the jurors hear that, I think
you'll see that what he says is believable,'' Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' lawyers said they were pleased with the first week of
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ''It went as well as any criminal trial I've ever been involved
in 20 years,'' said attorney Don Samuel. ''Up until Chester, every
single witness absolutely exonerated Ray.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, a woman riding in Lewis' limousine testified she
did not see him throw any punches or kick anyone during the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Keiva Walls, a Houston hairstylist who met the NFL star for the
first time Super Bowl weekend, said she saw blood in the limousine
after a melee. Walls also testified that she was in Lewis' hotel
room after the fight and heard him say, ''I'm not trying to end my
career like this.'' She said at the time she did not know two men
had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ozonu, a cab driver, told the jury he saw a man with an
athletic build standing over a body and pointing angrily.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has a body I could envy. He was built like a V,'' Ozonu
said. ''He kept on pointing and talking to the body that was
down.''
</P>
<P>
   But under cross examination, Ozonu said the man pointing at the
body was smaller than Lewis. Garland suggested the man pointing was
a friend of the victim, and Ozonu said that was a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Ozonu said he saw six men beating one man, but he could not
identify anyone in the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Walls said 11 people and a driver were in Lewis' limousine after
the fight, including two people known to Walls as Gino and Claudus,
who police have not found or identified.
</P>
<P>
   Walls said she saw no knives, punches or kicks.
</P>
<P>
   ''You never saw anyone who is on trial in this case with a
knife?'' asked Steve Sadow, Sweeting's attorney, during cross
examination.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's correct,'' Walls said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Walls did testify that on her way home, a friend named
Carlos got out of the car with a brown paper bag and started
walking toward a garbage bin.

<HEADLINE> Initial Payment Made in Coyotes Sale  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Developer Steve Ellman made an initial $10
million payment Friday night to buy the Phoenix Coyotes and said
hockey legend Wayne Gretzky will be a part-owner.
</P>
<P>
   Principals in the sale pushed within four hours of their
midnight deadline to line up investors and make the payment.
</P>
<P>
   ''They did get it done,'' current owner Richard Burke said.
''Everything is fine. They deserve a lot of credit for getting a
lot done in a short period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke and Ellman, who will build an arena for the team as part
of a $535 million suburban Scottsdale redevelopment project, are
scheduled to finalize the deal June 30, but Burke said that is more
of a formality.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the big part here,'' Burke said.
</P>
<P>
   Ellman would forfeit the $10 million if the deal doesn't go
through. Burke will continue to run the team until the sale is
complete.
</P>
<P>
   The sticking point in negotiations had been the participation of
Wayne Gretzky, according to a published report.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Republic reported on its Web site that Ellman flew
to Los Angeles early Friday to make a last-minute pitch to Gretzky
to sign on as a co-owner.
</P>
<P>
   Later Friday night, Ellman and Gretzky issued a joint statement
announcing Gretzky's decision to join the new ownership group but
gave no details as to his role. A news conference with Gretzky is
scheduled May 31 in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very excited to have the opportunity to work together
to build upon the Coyotes' winning tradition,'' they said in their
statement. ''We are fully committed to build the new Los Arcos
arena and to bring a Stanley Cup to Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, the franchise would be finished in Arizona if
Ellman were unable to complete the $87 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL, which brokered the arrangement between Burke and Ellman
in an attempt to anchor the Coyotes in Arizona, originally set a
May 17 deadline. Burke extended the deadline to give Ellman time to
put together his investment group and continue his pursuit of
Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, the most prolific scorer in NHL history, had nibbled at
the bait since March without deciding whether to accept a 10
percent share of the team and an executive position in exchange for
lending his name to the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky has said he would like to be reunited with Glen Sather,
his former coach, in an owner-general manager arrangement. But TSN
reported Friday that Sather, who resigned as Edmonton's president
and GM on May 19, is close to agreeing to a contract with the New
York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Sather told the Edmonton Journal he was
unclear what was going on in Phoenix and hadn't spoken with Gretzky
in several days.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers believe Burke will sell the team to Microsoft
founder Paul Allen, who wants to move the Coyotes to Portland to
share the Rose Garden with the NBA's Trail Blazers, if Ellman's
plans fall through.
</P>
<P>
   Ellman must raise an additional $90 million to cover the
purchase of the team and an estimated $20 million in operating
losses over the next two seasons at the America West Arena, a venue
in downtown Phoenix built for basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Burke has claimed losses of $25 million over the Coyotes' first
three seasons in the arena because 4,200 seats have restricted
views of the ice and can't be sold for a normal price, and because
his status as tenant restricts his ancillary revenue.
</P>
<P>
   He said in mid-January that he would be willing to sell the team
because of the slow pace of construction at Los Arcos Mall in
Scottsdale, where Ellman's company has contracted to build an
18,000-seat arena for the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the mall redevelopment would be funded with the
recapture of sales taxes generated on the site -- a mechanism
approved by voters last November.
</P>
<P>
   The $170 million arena is the centerpiece of the project, and
Scottsdale redevelopment director Gary Roe said he was worried
about the effect that any hitch in the sale would have on the rest
of the project.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the public vote was predicated on a hockey arena being
built on the site,'' Roe said. ''We'd need to take on a whole new
approach and then wrestle with the financial implications of the
approach. So it really is starting over.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke said he has spent the last five months trying to complete
a deal that would build the arena and give the Coyotes new revenue
opportunities. Competitors such as the Colorado Avalanche, Dallas
Stars and Detroit Red Wings have double the payroll, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to have a new building in order to be competitive,''
Burke said. ''This was the way to get it done.''

<HEADLINE> Blazers Let Game 3 Slip Away  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The Portland Trail Blazers had Kobe Bryant
figured out, right up until the final few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Using bigger players to overwhelm the Los Angeles Lakers guard,
the Blazers held him to just seven second-half points. But it was
Bryant's two crucial defensive plays in the final seconds that
allowed the Lakers to slip away with a 93-91 victory Friday night
and a 2-1 series lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had to take a chance. We've played all season long for
this,'' said Bryant, who was in foul trouble most of the second
half. ''I'm not going to let a guy get a clear look just because I
have five fouls.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant blocked a driving shot attempt by Blazers center Arvydas
Sabonis just before the horn to preserve the win.
</P>
<P>
   On the final sequence, Damon Stoudamire fed the ball to Sabonis
on the perimeter, and the 7-foot-3 Lithuanian faked a jumper, then
drove toward the basket. The Lakers' Ron Harper went to Sabonis'
left, leaving Bryant open to time his jump perfectly and knock
Sabonis' shot away.
</P>
<P>
   Sabonis wailed and flailed his arms, and the sellout Rose Garden
crowd booed the lack of a foul call, but replays showed Bryant had
all ball. As time ran out, Bryant flung the ball downcourt, his
tongue wagging.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, the Blazers quieted down, admitting Sabonis
should have taken the jumper.
</P>
<P>
   ''In these kind of games, you really can't leave the game up to
the refs,'' Stoudamire said.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, the Blazers threw away the homecourt advantage
they wrested away from the Lakers with Monday's 106-77 rout in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel we gave the game away,'' Portland's Brian Grant said.
''We had every opportunity to win this game, but we just blew it.
Back to the drawing board.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, lit up most of the night by Scottie Pippen and even the
little-used Stacey Augmon, also had a key steal before the Blazers'
last possession.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, who averaged 22.5 points during the regular season, had
just 25 total in the first two games against Portland. In Game 2,
the Blazers sent Steve Smith and Bonzi Wells at him, and Bryant
couldn't stop them.
</P>
<P>
   While Bryant started fast Friday night with 14 of his 25 points
in the first quarter, he was a liability on defense most of the
night. Augmon, who had scored just one point in six playoff games
this season, outmuscled Bryant for eight points in the second
quarter alone, hitting four of six shots.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like we did a good job of really passing the ball
inside, getting penetration from the post,'' Pippen said. ''We were
getting very easy shots from the post. I mean, we only lost the
game by two points, so I don't feel like we really settled for the
jump shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Having to guard Scottie Pippen this time proved more difficult
for Bryant than defending Stoudamire. Bryant had held Stoudamire
scoreless in Game 2, and although Pippen scored just 12 points, he
backed down Bryant twice in the final 2{ minutes and scored easily
on hooks.
</P>
<P>
   The last shot tied it at 91 with 1:15 to go, but the Blazers
failed to score the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ultimately, it came down to turnovers,'' Portland coach Mike
Dunleavy said. ''We had 15, and it turned into 25 points. That was
the biggest difference in the game.''

<HEADLINE> Lakers 93, Trail Blazers 91  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Phil Jackson coached Chicago to
championships. Scottie Pippen was a star on those teams. Then there
was Ron Harper, a Bulls role player who turned hero for the Los
Angeles Lakers in Game 3 of the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Harper's 18-foot baseline jumper with 29.9 seconds to play, on a
pass from Kobe Bryant, gave Los Angeles the lead for good Friday
night as the Lakers pulled out a 93-91 victory over Portland to
regain command of the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''It felt great,'' Harper said. ''It was a nice, open shot. I
told the guys in the huddle that I'd been wide open the whole ball
game. I found me a slot and he made a nice pass and it was two.
Ball game!''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant blocked Arvydas Sabonis' driving shot just before the
buzzer as the Lakers took a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven series.
Game 4 is Sunday in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal scored 18 of his 26 points in the second half
and grabbed 12 rebounds, and Bryant scored 18 of his 25 in the
first half for the Lakers in the first close game of the series.
Both played the entire game.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the last two of Harper's 12 points that were the
biggest.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a reward for Ron, especially when they've been
leaving him open this series,'' said Jackson, who has the Lakers
two victories away from the NBA Finals in his first season as
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said he went away from the triangle offense and just
drove to the basket with the intention of getting the ball to
Harper.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew he was going to be open,'' Bryant said. ''He was
hiding out on that baseline. He was there, and hit the big shot.''
</P>
<P>
   With O'Neal and Bryant on the court, somebody is always left
open for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''People don't realize Ron Harper has played at another level in
this league,'' Portland's Steve Smith said. ''He's been an all-star
and a 20-point scorer. He has just changed his role on this team.
With a team like the Lakers, you've got to let someone be open.
Some nights we might choose Harp, some nights we might choose
someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the wrong choice Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, who scored eight of his 12 in the final 4:03, scored
inside to tie it at 91 with 1:14 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Each team had a turnover before Harper's open jumper put the
Lakers ahead. Going for the tying basket, Wallace lost the ball and
the Lakers took it downcourt, but Wallace stole Bryant's pass to
give Portland one last shot.
</P>
<P>
   Sabonis complained that he was fouled on his final drive, but
replays showed a clean block.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sabas took the ball to the hole, and we didn't get the call,''
Pippen said. ''The officials aren't going to call that. The better
percentage was for him to shoot the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, who kept playing despite turning his left ankle in the
third quarter, scored 19 points on 9-of-11 shooting for Portland.
Damon Stoudamire also had 19 after going scoreless in Game 2 for
the Blazers, who lost at home for the first time in six playoff
games.
</P>
<P>
   Smith scored 14 and Sabonis had 11.
</P>
<P>
   ''We found a way to get back in the series by reclaiming the
homecourt advantage,'' Jackson said. ''Now the pressure's on them
in Sunday's ball game to try to maintain because if we put another
notch in our belt on Sunday, they're really at death's door, and
they know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Blown out at home by 29 points in Game 2 Monday night, the
Lakers fell behind 15-2 early Friday, were down by as many as 14 in
the second quarter and trailed 55-45 in the half.
</P>
<P>
   But Los Angeles, 2-3 on the road in the playoffs, caught the
Blazers with a 20-6 run in the third quarter, then took control
with a 9-0 spurt in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first two quarters, O'Neal was largely ineffective
against Portland's double- and triple-team defense. Sabonis
outscored him 9-8 in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   But the MVP took over with a 13-point third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''The coaching staff and the players kind of got on me and said
I wasn't working hard enough for the shot,'' O'Neal said. ''The
first half I felt they were coming really, really fast and I found
it not to our advantage for me to take a lot of shots over two and
three guys, so I was just trying to pass it out.
</P>
<P>
   ''But they told me to be more aggressive and score, so I was
looking to score a little bit more.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal scored 10 in a 20-6 run that gave Los Angeles its first
lead of the game, at 69-67 on Harper's two free throws with 1:44
left in the quarter. Portland briefly regained the lead on baskets
by Wallace and Stoudamire.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neal, purposely fouled with 15.6 seconds left in the third
as part of Portland coach Mike Dunleavy's ''Hack-a-Shaq''
philosophy, made both free throws to put Los Angeles up 72-71 going
into the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Down 87-81, the Blazers fought back. Pippen sank one of two free
throws, stole the ball from Rick Fox and made a 3-pointer to cut it
to 87-85 with 3:35 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's slick move in the key made it 89-85, then Pippen scored
again to cut it to 89-87. Glen Rice, who scored just eight points,
made two free throws to boost the lead to 91-87.
</P>
<P>
   Sabonis made two free throws with 1:56 to go to cut the lead to
91-89, then Pippen tied it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We played a lot of great minutes but ultimately it came down
to turnovers we made,'' Dunleavy said. ''We had 15 turnovers, and
it turned into 25 points. That was the biggest difference in the
ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland shot 68 percent in the first quarter and 56 percent in
the first half, when its depth and balance was on full display.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant kept the Lakers in the game with 14 points in the first
quarter, but Stacey Augmon came off the bench to shut Bryant down
in the second period. Augmon also scored eight points in the
quarter, including an inside basket that gave the Blazers their
biggest lead of the half, 47-33 with 5:13 to go.
</P>
<P>
   The two baskets Bryant made in the second quarter came after
Augmon left the game.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Lakers outrebounded Portland 10-2 in the fourth
quarter. ... For the first time in the series, Bryant opened the
game guarding Pippen. ... Pippen threw the ball off Rick Fox and
Fox shoved Pippen, leading to technicals against both, with 7:23
left in the game. ... O'Neal was scoreless in the first quarter and
took only one shot. ... For once, Blazers owner Paul Allen wasn't
the richest man in the building. Sitting next to him was fellow
Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new and dangerous computer virus has surfaced on
cpmputers using the Microsoft Outlook e-mail systm, the FBI said Friday night.
The virus is carried in a file attached to an e-mail with the subject "Resume -
Janet Simons." The attachment is a Microsoft Word file called "EXPLORER.DOC" or
"RESUME.DOC," according to an alert posted on the Web site of Network
Associates, a computer security company. If a computer user opens the
attachment, the virus will spread itself by sending an e-mail to everyone in the
user's e-mail address book, the company said. When the user closes the Word
document, the virus will then delete important files on the user's computer.

that he had fired the country's democratically elected government and would

granted immunity from prosecution for their roles in the coup attempt. The
announcement signaled that Mara was caving in to two of Speight's three main
demands. But Mara did not give in to the third demand -- that he resign as
president. The announcement was the latest offer to Speight in an attempt to
bring an end to the hostage standoff at parliament.

says its too early to retire the Katushya rockets that his forces periodically
fired into Israel in its campaign to drive Israeli troops off Lebanese soil.
Standing before 30,000 cheering supporters in this former Israeli stronghold in
southern Lebanon, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah warned Israel would pay a "high price,"
for any aggression against its northern neighbor. Palestinians should take heart
from this week's chaotic departure of Israeli forces from the security zone they
occupied in southern Lebanon and renew their own armed struggle to recover lands
they claim, Nasrallah said.

formula ... for a reignited arms race." In his first public comments on the
proposals by his Republican presidential rival, Gore argued Friday for a more
limited antimissile defense system that he said would protect the nation without
forcing it to break the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Earlier in the week,
Texas Gov. Bush proposed cutting the nuclear arsenal to its "lowest possible
number consistent with our national security," even without Russia's approval.

<HEADLINE> Clinton picks up endorsement from Long Island labor group  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLEN COVE, N.Y. (AP) -- On Long Island for the first time since
Rep. Rick Lazio entered the U.S. Senate race, Hillary Rodham
Clinton picked up an endorsement from a labor group that once
backed her Republican opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the Long Island Building and Construction
Trades Council, which backed Lazio in his 1998 Congressional race
against Democratic challenger John Bace, said Friday the group was
switching allegiances because Lazio had opposed a proposal to raise
the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ''We looked at his record,'' said Jack Kennedy, leader of the
umbrella organization of trade unions representing 60,000 members.
''The AFL-CIO sent us his record and his record as far as voting on
labor issues and working people has not been good; it's been very
poor. We think it's time that we get somebody who's going to help
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, meanwhile, campaigned Friday in Staten Island, saying he
has no intention of resigning his House seat in order to campaign
full time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have an impeccable record in terms of attendance,'' he said.
''I think I made every vote except one in my eight years in
Congress, and I think the people of New York understand I entered
this race with only five months to go and there may be some votes I
miss.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio entered the race a week ago, after Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
dropped out because of his prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, Clinton deflected a question about a poll that
shows Lazio pulling into a statistical dead-heat with the first
lady after only a week of campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, I've always said this is going to be a very close,
very tough race, and I'm just going to do what I've been doing,''
she said. ''I'm going to keep working every single day to earn the
trust and votes and endorsements of New Yorkers from one end of the
state to the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said the Zogby poll, showing Clinton favored by 46 percent
and him at 44 percent, proved that ''the more people begin to hear
who I am and what I've done, the better I will do.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he doesn't want to win the Senate seat with an
anti-Hillary vote. ''I hope most people will support me because of
who I am and what I say.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning with popular local Rep. Vito Fossella by his side,
Lazio shook hands with ferry commuters and later charmed a group of
about 100 card-playing senior citizens at the New Dorp Beach
Friendship Club.
</P>
<P>
   To thunderous applause, Lazio told the seniors he came because
''I wanted to be where the real people are.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not lost on many that Lazio had already done what
Clinton's campaign had failed to do in nearly a year of campaign
stops -- meet face to face with Staten Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has made two private stops there, one with a handful of
Democratic leaders and the other a small, private dinner, but has
yet to hold any public events on Staten Island, a borough which has
strongly backed Giuliani in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Before Lazio arrived, Lee Holub, Gaye Summers and Renee
Jacovetti reserved judgment on him, saying they didn't know
anything about him, although all three were anti-Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think she has a lot of gall,'' said Holub, a self-described
lifelong Democrat. ''I don't like President Clinton and what he did
and she's connected to him, so I don't like her either.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Taiwan Detains Chinese Ship  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan has detained a Chinese ship near
the island's southern coast and arrested five alleged spies, the
government said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The ship was detained Monday off Tainan in southern Taiwan, the
Coastal Patrol Administration said. Five Chinese men on board
claimed to be fishermen but could not explain why they carried
night-vision cameras and Taiwanese maps but no fishing equipment,
it said.
</P>
<P>
   Film seized from the men showed shots of military facilities and
sentries deployed on the outlying Taiwanese islands of Penghu and
Wuchiu, the administration said.
</P>
<P>
   The men were handed over to the Tainan District Court on charges
of endangering national security, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The seizure comes at a sensitive time. On Thursday, China began
weeklong live-fire artillery exercises near outlying Taiwanese
islands.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's military said the drills were routine, denying
newspaper reports that the Chinese would aim their guns at Wuchiu.
</P>
<P>
   China and Taiwan separated amid civil war in 1949, and Beijing
has repeatedly threatened to invade. Relations have been especially
sensitive since a new democratically elected government took office
in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing distrusts Taiwan's President Chen Shui-bian, although
Chen has backed away from his earlier views that Taiwan should seek
formal independence from China. The mainland considers Taiwan a
renegade province.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Anti-Drug Spraying Begins  </HEADLINE>
By MARGARITA MARTINEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA GABARRA, Colombia (AP) -- When police planes swooped down and
sprayed herbicides over the fields outside this dusty little
village, they dented more than the numbers of coca plants used to
make cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The following weekend, the number of prostitutes in town was way
down, residents say. Their spendthrift young clients wouldn't have
had a peso in their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have launched a major anti-drug offensive in this
remote eastern region near the Venezuelan border -- fumigating the
green fields and setting jungle cocaine laboratories on fire.
</P>
<P>
   The police strikes -- which in an 11-day span this month have
destroyed 120 drug ''kitchens'' and sprayed 3,700 of the area's
nearly 25,000 acres of coca -- will hit hard at a local economy that
has come to depend on the illegal plantings.
</P>
<P>
   But some residents of La Gabarra are welcoming the offensive.
They see it as a way out of a cycle of vice and violence that has
overtaken their formerly quiet, pastoral home since the coca moved
in.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing this plant has brought us is war,'' said Lina
Carrero, whose shop in La Gabarra's main square could go bust if
the local cash crop disappears.
</P>
<P>
   Once living off cattle ranching and crops like plantains and
cacao, the Catatumbo region that includes La Gabarra has
metamorphosed into Colombia's second-largest coca-growing area,
after the leftist rebel-controlled south.
</P>
<P>
   It also has become one of the South American country's most
violent places.
</P>
<P>
   The squat, shiny coca bushes began sprouting up in the area in
the early 1990s, officials said. The crop expanded exponentially a
few years ago, aided by a scarce government presence and armed
gangs who protect the coca for a cut of the profits.
</P>
<P>
   When right-wing paramilitary militias moved in to the region,
long a stronghold of leftist rebels, they left a trail of massacres
and refugees.
</P>
<P>
   A paramilitary incursion in April left 21 people dead in Tibu,
the township that includes La Gabarra. Massacres last August killed
at least 51 people and sent nearly 3,000 frightened villagers
fleeing into Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   For many, as worrisome as the violence is the ethical breakdown
the drug trade has wrought.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has been a transformation in values,'' said La Gabarra's
Roman Catholic priest, the Rev. Sady Castaneda. ''Now what we have
are anti-values, a culture of money by any means.''
</P>
<P>
   Personifying the new decadent lifestyle, Castaneda said, are the
estimated 20,000 coca-pickers known as ''raspachines'' who've came
to eke out a living in the fields of Catatumbo.
</P>
<P>
   Many migrated from depressed regions where they worked on coffee
and cotton estates. Most are bachelors who spend a good portion of
their earnings on booze and women. They can make as much as $25 a
day -- nearly five times the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   The cash influx, however, has driven prices of ordinary
commodities through the roof. An egg in La Gabarra costs 50 cents,
more than five times its price in the capital, Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   When officials came from Bogota to see the spraying last week,
some residents asked why the government destroys crops, but doesn't
bring jobs, education or security.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all live off of this,'' said Asdrubal Perez, a
clothing-store owner who once farmed coca. ''What are we going to
do now?''
</P>
<P>
   The government is pledging to provide adjustment loans to coca
farmers when its begins a major fumigation thrust planned for later
this year in southern Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   But as he stood in a coca field in La Gabarra that had just been
sprayed, Defense Minister Luis Ramirez warned people not to expect
a handout.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before there was coca the people didn't get any aid,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Troops Guard Lebanon Border  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN SEVAREID
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) -- U.N. peacekeepers were deployed today
to a flashpoint border fence where Lebanese guerrillas and
civilians have been taunting and throwing stones and firebombs at
Israeli soldiers facing them.
</P>
<P>
   The troops from the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon kept people
about 25 yards away on the Lebanese side of the fence to prevent
friction.
</P>
<P>
   A white armored personnel carrier with 10 armed soldiers wearing
flak jackets and blue helmets blocked access to the fence today.
About 100 Lebanese stood by and one threw stones that landed across
the fence. Israeli soldiers also kept people, including
journalists, away from their side of the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon on Wednesday,
civilians and armed guerrillas have been converging on the locked
border crossing. Some families came out of curiosity to peek at
Israel -- which most Lebanese have never seen -- but others shouted
insults at the Israelis and threw firebombs, stones, glass bottles
and fruit at Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, the Israeli government complained to U.N.
peacekeepers about the potential for trouble at the border fence
following the Israeli withdrawal that ended its 22-year military
engagement in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.N. sources reported that Israeli forces on Friday
night removed up to three remaining outposts near Chebaa town ahead
of U.N. teams marking the international border between the two
countries. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 explosions were heard late Friday by residents of
Chebaa on the western foothills of Mount Hermon. Lebanese security
officials suspected the detonations were to demolish the positions
from which the Israelis withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   The abandoned outposts are not part of the nearby disputed
Chebaa farms, a strip of land Israel captured from Syria in the
1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese government says the Chebaa farms are part of
Lebanon, a position Syria supports. But U.N. envoy Terje
Roed-Larsen said in Beirut on Friday that the United Nations
considers the Chebaa farms Syrian, meaning Israel's presence there
would not impede a formal U.N. confirmation of the Israeli
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah guerrilla leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, in a rally in
the former Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon on Friday,
urged Israel to withdraw from the Chebaa farms. He did not say
whether Hezbollah would attack Israel if it did not vacate Chebaa
farms, as the guerrilla group had threatened in the past.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. spokesman Timur Goskel said U.N. teams have begun working
on marking the Lebanon-Israel border, a necessary step before the
United Nations officially confirms the Israeli withdrawal from
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The teams are checking the border line to make sure it complies
with maps prior to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Goskel said the U.N. experts set out Friday from the Naqoura
border point on the Mediterranean Sea, operating on the Israeli
side. The experts were expected to meet up with Lebanese teams on
this side of the border and continue their mission all along the
border line inland up to the Chebaa area near Mount Hermon.
</P>
<P>
   Goskel described the task as a ''technical job,'' adding that
the teams have ''made good progress.'' He gave no indication when
the mission would be completed.
</P>
<P>
   Israel had occupied the swath of land in south Lebanon to
protect its northern towns from guerrilla attacks. Hours after its
withdrawal, hundreds of armed guerrillas swarmed into the former
Israeli outposts.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli-allied militiamen surrendered or fled to Israel. More
than 6,000 ex-militiamen and their families sought refuge in
Israel.

<HEADLINE> Navy Stops Controversial Sonar Test  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Navy says it won't perform high-volume
sonar tests that could be harmful to whales and other marine life
when it conducts a military exercise off the New Jersey coast.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists welcomed the decision, which marks an
escalation in a dispute over whether an effort by the Navy to test
and deploy advanced underwater detection systems is dangerous to
the huge mammals.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement reported in The Washington Post on Saturday, the
Navy said its Littoral Warfare Advanced Development test 45 miles
offshore will go ahead this coming week but will ''not include
active acoustic sources.''
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists believe that whales and other marine mammals can
be harmed by the extremely high-decibel sounds emitted by the
Navy's new sonar systems. The animals rely on their hearing for
navigation and can suffer hearing loss and other problems because
of the sonar noise, which can be greater than a 747 jetliner at
takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, a dozen whales beached themselves in the Bahamas
a day after the Navy used the intense sonar in exercises there.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Commerce Department's National Marine
Fisheries Service sent a letter to the Office of Naval Research
complaining that the Navy's assessment of potential environmental
damage was inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Reynolds, an official with the Natural Resources Defense
Council, said the Navy's decision to cancel the tests marks a
significant change.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think this is very important because the Navy has now been
told it cannot simply reserve a vessel, schedule an exercise and
proceed without worry of environmental impacts when dealing with
low-frequency sonar systems,'' he told the Post.

<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A man who robbed a Philippine
Airlines flight and then parachuted to his death wanted to make
some money to move his family away from the community where his
father was killed eight years ago, his mother said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Luz Chua identified the robber as her son, Reginald, at the
morgue Saturday, where his body was taken after it was found the
previous day nearly buried in mud with only his hands and knees
protruding.
</P>
<P>
   ''He loved me. He loved his parents that's why this happened. He
was a good son. I cannot say anything against him,'' a crying Luz
Chua told radio station DZMM.
</P>
<P>
   Reginald Chua was armed with a grenade and a pistol when he
tried to turn around a flight Thursday from southern Davao City to
Manila. When he was told there was not enough fuel, he told the
crew to collect money from the 277 other passengers, then had the
rear door opened and jumped from 6,000 feet with a homemade
parachute.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses saw him separate from the chute, and he landed on a
mountain about 40 miles east of Manila.
</P>
<P>
   Luz Chua said her son was deeply hurt by the killing of his
father eight years ago over a land dispute.
</P>
<P>
   She said she last spoke with Reginald on Monday and asked him to
help her with her business in Davao.
</P>
<P>
   ''But he said he could not do it in their community, where the
people involved in his father's murder still roamed free,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Her son said he would look for money elsewhere and return to get
her and the rest of their family.
</P>
<P>
   Airline officials first identified the man as Augusto Lakandula
through his seat number. But he carried a driver's license that
identified him as Reginald Chua. Police recovered $33 of the man's
loot.
</P>
<P>
   The plane landed with the passengers and 14 crew members
unharmed.

<HEADLINE> China Managers Given Death Penalty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Managers of companies in two Chinese cities have
been sentenced to death for taking bribes, a state-run newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Zhou Changqing, a company manager in Xi'an in central China's
Shanxi province, was sentenced to death Friday after being found
guilty of taking $5.87 million worth of bribes, the Yangcheng
Evening News reported.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate report, the newspaper said that Xu Guangming,
manager of a development company in Lanzhou, the capital of
northwestern Gansu province, was sentenced May 19 to die after
being found guilty of taking $732,500 in bribes and kickbacks and
for conspiring to steal state assets worth $34 million.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper, published Friday and seen Saturday in Beijing,
said Xu had also received a Mercedes Benz sedan as a bribe.
</P>
<P>
   China's practice of executing people convicted of economic
crimes has been condemned by international rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   The use of the death penalty for nonviolent crimes appears to
have increased in recent years amid a nationwide campaign against
rampant corruption.

<HEADLINE> Bizarre promotions all part of minor league baseball in N.J.  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- For about six bucks, minor league baseball
fans can dig up the infield dirt in search of a $5,000 diamond, try
to win $1 million by guessing a team's attendance, smack water
balloons with bats on a hot summer night, or even get married at
home plate.
</P>
<P>
   They can also see a baseball game. But for many New Jersey fans,
the game has become a secondary attraction.
</P>
<P>
   While strange promotions and bizarre stunts have long been a way
to lure fans through the turnstiles in the minor leagues, they're
becoming an even larger part of the minor league experience in New
Jersey, where teams feel they're competing as much with the mall as
with the Mets for the public's money.
</P>
<P>
   ''We compete against the movie theaters, not the New York
Yankees or the New Jersey Nets,'' said Kevin Reynolds, general
manager of the Newark Bears of the independent Atlantic League.
Promotions ''are important to get people in here, and also to make
sure there's something to do for people of all ages once they get
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Shepard, general manager of the Atlantic City Surf, put it
succinctly: ''We're selling entertainment, and there happens to be
a baseball game being played around it.''
</P>
<P>
   His team gave season tickets for life to the baby born closest
to the first pitch of this year's home opener on May 2, although it
will be a few years before Morgan Giordano of Swainton will be old
enough to use them.
</P>
<P>
   Making sure teams draw well is not just important to the club
owners; taxpayers have a stake as well. Each of the minor league
baseball stadiums in New Jersey were built either entirely or
largely with public funds, and host communities don't want to be
stuck with an empty stadium that cost anywhere from $15 million to
$30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the promotions are aimed at drawing more female fans
to the park. The Somerset Patriots in Bridgewater are sponsoring an
essay contest in which engaged couples are encouraged to write in
and tell the team why they want to be married at home plate of the
team's Bridgewater stadium before the Aug. 12 game. The team will
provide a reception for 100 guests before the game, videotape the
ceremony, and even provide someone to perform the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears will hold the ''Diamond Dig'' on June 6, a promotion
in which the team will hide a half-carat diamond worth about $5,000
somewhere on the infield before the game. After the game is over,
all women aged 18 or older will be invited to line up on the
outfield warning track, and given small spoons.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then we play 'CHARGE' on the organ, you know,
da-da-da-DA-da-da! And they come racing in from the outfield with
their spoons and start digging up the infield,'' Reynolds said.
''Whoever finds the diamond gets to keep it. We did this when I was
with the Tampa Yankees, and women beat each other up for it.
They're elbowing each other as they're running from the outfield.''
</P>
<P>
   Who wants to be a millionaire? Anyone who successfully predicts
the exact amount of tickets sold to Newark Bears home games this
season will win $1 million. The team and a sponsor took out an
insurance policy that would provide the money in the unlikely event
someone guesses the exact number.
</P>
<P>
   The Trenton Thunder, the Eastern League Class AA affiliate of
the Boston Red Sox, frequently picks the dirtiest car from its fan
parking lots and awards the owner a free car wash.

<HEADLINE> Va. Gov. Pushed Veteran Plans  </HEADLINE>
By BOB LEWIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- The nation should honor its war dead this
Memorial Day by resolving to cut taxes, bolster the military and
upgrade schools, Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore said today.
</P>
<P>
   ''Government now takes more than 30 percent of our nation's
income in taxes. That is the highest level of taxation since we
sacrificed our livelihoods -- and many citizen soldiers their lives
-- to win World War II,'' Gilmore said in the weekly Republican
radio address, taped Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He said Uncle Sam should follow the lead of several Republican
governors -- himself included -- in reducing taxes so people can
save, invest and start businesses. ''Americans want not to become
wards of the state, but successful and independent people,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia is paring its local personal property tax on
automobiles, and Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating and Massachusetts Gov.
Paul Cellucci secured their states' largest tax-relief packages
ever, Gilmore noted.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest partisan plug went to Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the
presumptive GOP presidential nominee. Gilmore is co-chairman of
Victory 2000, a national fund-raising and campaign assistance arm
of the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ''... In a demonstration of presidential leadership, (Bush) has
proposed the first reforms to truly save Social Security for future
generations while preserving benefits for present retirees,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. armed forces must be bolstered and retooled for a post-Cold
War world in which ''a single enemy has been replaced with
terrorists and rogue nations that operate outside of the
international order,'' Gilmore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ''has proposed a bold plan to update our nuclear policy and
boost our armed forces to deal with these new threats,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On education, Gilmore said Republican governors are demanding
more accountability from schools and experimenting in many states
with school choice and charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   School choice allows parents to pick the public schools their
children attend. Charter schools are exempted from many state laws
and regulations in exchange for higher levels of student
performance, a concept President Clinton also advocates.

<HEADLINE> Journalist Alleges Peru Vote Fraud  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- His hospital gown stained with blood, Fabian
Salazar says he was tortured with a saw and robbed of evidence he
claims would show that President Alberto Fujimori's shadowy
intelligence chief pulls the strings in Peru's elections.
</P>
<P>
   The specter of Vladimiro Montesinos, a man who prefers to remain
behind the scenes, loomed large Friday as Salazar's story was
spread by newspapers, television and radio.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos might otherwise have gone largely unnoticed as
Fujimori heads toward certain victory in Sunday's presidential
runoff against an opponent -- Alejandro Toledo -- who refuses to
participate because he says the vote is rigged to give Fujimori a
third five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar, an editorial commentator for the opposition newspaper
La Republica, said he obtained videotapes Wednesday night from
sources inside Montesinos' National Intelligence Service, or SIN,
which showed the spy chief meeting with National Election Board
President Alipio Montes de Oca and Jose Portillo, the official
coordinating the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar said he could not make out the conversation with Montes
de Oca. But he alleged that Montesinos gave Portillo clear
instructions about which opposition candidates should be denied
seats in Congress in last month's general elections.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence was taken away, he said, when three men forced
their way into his downtown Lima office Wednesday night and slowly
sawed into his left arm while trying to force him to reveal his
sources.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was jolted with pain with every pass of the blade until it
hit bone,'' he told The Associated Press from his hospital bed in a
private clinic. ''I couldn't reveal who my sources were, even if it
meant death because it would have meant certain death for them.''
</P>
<P>
   A doctor interrupted the interview to examine the tendon damage
Salazar suffered.
</P>
<P>
   A National Election Board spokesman, Luis Arana, said Montes de
Oca had nothing to say because electoral magistrates comment only
on election-related cases.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated messages left for National Intelligence Service
officials and Portillo went unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do not mention this as torture,'' snapped Interior Minister
Cesar Saucedo, when questioned Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's rushing to judgment,'' he said, adding that the case
would be investigated by an ad hoc prosecutor and a special police
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Headlines alleging torture by intelligence agents do not occur
often in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   The last big case happened three years ago when Leonor La Rosa,
a former military intelligence officer, was left a paraplegic by
her superiors in retaliation for leaking information to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''This type of very violent reaction occurs when there are
direct leaks from within. That is what concerns them the most,''
said political scientist Fernando Rospigliosi. ''This is what
happened with Leonor La Rosa.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in more than two years, La Rosa returned on
Thursday from her exile home in Sweden. The next day she was
wheeled on a gurney before television cameras, where she appealed
to her former colleagues in Peru's military intelligence not to
subvert the election.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no democracy in Peru,'' she said. ''There is only
dictatorship.''
</P>
<P>
   In April 1997, a military court convicted four army intelligence
members of torturing La Rosa with electrical charges to her hands
and feet and whipping her head against the wall by her hair so hard
it damaged her spine. Two of the four were later released after
appealing to a higher military court.
</P>
<P>
   La Rosa and Salazar's pasts intersect in the case of Israeli
native Baruch Ivcher. He was stripped of his Peruvian citizenship
after his television station revealed La Rosa's torture. Earlier,
she had leaked the station information about wiretapping of
journalists, government officials and opposition politicians.
Salazar was an executive at the station.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar said he expects Fujimori's government will use that
connection to depict his accusations as a stunt by opposition
journalists, and La Rosa as an embittered ex-agent out for revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look, if it had been a scratch or a cut, OK,'' he said,
raising his bandaged forearm. ''I'm going to let them cut my arm
this badly? How could that be possible? Who would go to that
extreme?''

<HEADLINE> Family Mourns Israeli Soldier Death  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN NOVECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELYAKHIN, Israel (AP) -- In this tight-knit community of modest
white houses with orange-tiled roofs, no directions are needed to
the Uzeri home. It's the one with death notices still posted on the
gate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shaked Uzeri, Sergeant, First Class,'' the signs say.
''Blessed be his memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, a family mourns the son who died three weeks ago, hit by
a rocket as he sat in his jeep on the Israeli side of the Lebanon
border, gazing at the view.
</P>
<P>
   Shaked's parents hope he'll be remembered for his wide and ready
smile, his industriousness, his strength of character. But they
know he'll likely be recorded as a statistic -- the last soldier
killed before Israel pulled its troops from the Lebanon quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   ''At least we can hope that no other family will go through what
we have,'' muses his sister, Kineret. Her mother, though, takes
cold comfort in the fact that the troops have come home.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't change anything,'' Shoshana Uzeri says. ''My son is
already dead.'' She slaps her hand to her head in disbelief.
''We've lost a son,'' she repeats.
</P>
<P>
   After an 18-year occupation, Israel left southern Lebanon last
week with stunning speed. But for the families of many of the some
1,000 soldiers killed there since 1982, it was far too long in
coming -- too long before the government acknowledged that its
''security zone'' was no longer an effective buffer against
guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, with the deaths of seven soldiers within weeks,
the opposing voices grew louder.
</P>
<P>
   Withdraw now, parents pleaded openly as graphic footage of
wounded soldiers appeared on TV screens. The July deadline set by
Prime Minister Ehud Barak seemed too far away. And some soldiers on
the front lines pleaded, too, through the media: Don't let me be
the last soldier to die in Lebanon, they begged.
</P>
<P>
   But Shaked Uzeri wasn't one of them.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Yemeni immigrant, Uzeri dreamed of a career in the
army. He fought hard to be accepted in an officer training course,
but the army resisted: Uzeri was 24 -- too old, they said -- because
he'd waited until he finished a stint as a technician.
</P>
<P>
   But he won in the end, and his mother remembers him opening his
acceptance letter only a month before his death. ''I got it!'' he
cried. The course was to start in June.
</P>
<P>
   Uzeri was proud of his service in Lebanon, his family says. ''If
I have to die, at least let it be in honor, protecting the
country,'' he told his father, Yosef.
</P>
<P>
   Although he went into Lebanon repeatedly from his base in
northern Israel, Uzeri assured his family he was in little danger.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't believe him,'' says Yosef. ''But what was I to do? He
was proud of what he was doing. And so I was proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Uzeri so enjoyed life with his buddies on the base that when he
had the chance to come home on Tuesday evenings, he usually
declined. But when he came home each weekend, he was the pillar of
the family. He loved working around the house, cleaning the pool,
doing the laundry, and especially washing his beloved bright yellow
Renault sports car.
</P>
<P>
   He was an hour away from another placid weekend at home when
death struck on May 4.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrilla rocket attacks from Lebanon had been increasing, and
Israel was responding with air strikes. Uzeri had been sent to
carry parts to an artillery battery across the border. After
finishing, he called his officer, who told him he could go home for
the Sabbath. It was about 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   As his parents tell it, Uzeri headed back to base with another
soldier. Somewhere along the way, he stopped and called a friend to
meet up with him and bring his personal car.
</P>
<P>
   A third of a mile from the base, the jeep stopped to wait. Uzeri
and his fellow soldier sat admiring the view when three Katyusha
rockets arced into Israel.
</P>
<P>
   One hit close to the jeep. A piece hit Uzeri in the head,
apparently killing him instantly. The jeep caught fire. The other
soldier managed to crawl out and run for help, before fainting.
</P>
<P>
   At the Uzeri household, friends gathered through the night and
the next day. Israeli President Ezer Weizman paid his respects, as
did the army chief of staff and other top officers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who didn't come?'' muses Shoshana Uzeri. ''Nobody didn't come.
That's how much this boy was loved.''
</P>
<P>
   Uzeri's small room has been emptied of its furniture, making way
for a pantry. But in his tiny bathroom, a small memorial candle
burns on the floor. On a shelf, 22 army shirts lie stacked,
perfectly pressed and ready.
</P>
<P>
   The family doesn't plan to remove them.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Soviet scientist hopes vibrations will uncover buried land mines </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOBOKEN, N.J. (AP) -- Around the world every day, hundreds of
people walk into minefields with metal detectors, then lay on the
ground and gently poke the earth with a thin rod to determine
whether the device located an explosive -- or a soda can.
</P>
<P>
   Far more often than not, the metal detector finds a can or
shrapnel, according to those who have done it. As a result, it
might take a day for a de-miner working in an area with a high
concentration of mines to cover a swath a yard wide and 15 yards
long.
</P>
<P>
   Work being done in a sandbox in northern New Jersey might one
day help mine eradicators do a more efficient job by letting them
see underground.
</P>
<P>
   The sandbox occupies half of a soundproof closet at Stevens
Institute of Technology, where Professor Dimitri M. Donskoy has
developed a method he believes can detect buried land mines using
vibrations.
</P>
<P>
   Three years of research funded with $770,000 from the Army has
led to a system that will be tested this summer at Fort A.P. Hill
in Virginia, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Donskoy's technique has many potential advantages over
existing detectors in many situations,'' said Dr. James F. Harvey,
a senior research program manager at the Army Research Lab-Army
Research Office.
</P>
<P>
   Its best use, however, may be as part of a combination of
sensors whose picture of the immediate subsurface distinguishes
between clutter and land mines, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Good results do not mean the system will be in field anytime
soon, however.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of technological challenges ahead of us,''
Donskoy cautioned in a recent interview at Stevens' Davidson
Laboratory, where he is associate director.
</P>
<P>
   If the system works, researchers must then determine how its
sensitive components can be packaged to withstand harsh conditions
in minefields, which are often far from roads and electrical
service.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 million to 70 million anti-personnel mines are planted
around the globe in 70 nations, according to the latest U.S. State
Department estimates. Humanitarian groups often use its earlier
figure, 110 million, which the State Department says was based on
incomplete information.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 people -- nearly all civilians -- are killed or maimed
every month by land mines, which can remain dangerous for decades,
according to the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Billions of dollars are being raised and budgeted for clearance
projects and victim assistance. The United States is spending $82
million this year to help clear mines and help victims in 36
countries, and has allocated nearly $19 million to research
eradication, said Donald ''Pat'' Patierno, director of the State
Department Office of Humanitarian Demining Programs.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, the United States has trained over 4,000 people in
mine clearance and detection, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among all de-miners, he estimates less than 300 have died in the
past decade, most in Kuwait around the Gulf War, before techniques
were refined.
</P>
<P>
   Among the defused mines Donskoy uses to test his system is a
''butterfly'' plastic mine, thousands of which were sprinkled by
air over Afghanistan by the Soviet Union -- Donskoy's native land.
</P>
<P>
   Before defecting in 1990, Donskoy helped the Soviets develop a
way to detect submarines through acoustic signals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 44-year-old scientist now lives in Hoboken with his family.
</P>
<P>
   Donskoy's system relies on the principal that land mines, unlike
rocks and roots, produce detectable vibrations when exposed to
noise or ground tremors.
</P>
<P>
   For testing purposes, Donskoy uses a subwoofer -- a loudspeaker
that produces deep sounds -- or a device that vibrates atop his
sand. The box itself is about a yard high and four feet square.
</P>
<P>
   The defused mines are buried at different depths, in either dirt
or sand, to test different conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Donskoy uses either a scanning laser or microwaves to measure
the vibrations coming from the sandbox. The mines vibrate at a
different frequency than the surrounding soil, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That information, called nonlinear acoustic signals, is fed to a
desktop computer, which produces a color image highlighting the
location of the mines.
</P>
<P>
   Although the system now uses several hundred thousand dollars
worth of fragile equipment, Donskoy said it has the potential of
being produced as cheaply as current hand-held or vehicle-based
detection systems.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the computer screen could be replaced by an
earpiece that beeps when it finds a mine, as it does on metal
detectors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Packaging is not insurmountable, agreed an Army researcher who
will be evaluating Donskoy's device this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''If something can demonstrate good detection capability, those
problems can be solved,'' said Dr. Tom Broach, a senior scientist
in the countermine division at Fort Belvoir, Va. The division is in
the night vision and electronic sensors directorate of the
Communications and Electronics Command (CECOM), which is based at
Fort Monmouth, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The metal detectors used for mine clearance cost $6,000 to
$12,000 each, and bear little resemblance to the $200 models
tourists use on beaches, said Richard Kidd, program manager at the
Washington-based Survey Action Center, a group involved in mine
eradication in six countries.
</P>
<P>
   Sturdy hand-held devices are often the only reliable detection
method on steep slopes with dense vegetation, Kidd said. Vehicles
and explosive-sniffing dogs, however, can be used on open terrain
where few mines are expected, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that a device that is acceptable for military use may
not be appropriate for humanitarian projects.
</P>
<P>
   In return for rapid detection and clearance, the military
accepts some casualties, said Kidd, a West Point graduate and
retired Army infantry captain. Armed forces can often provide
support services, such as technicians and electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Humanitarian projects often lack extensive support, and move
slowly because they require 100 percent eradication, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Donskoy's work is encouraging to Dave McCracken, a former
Canadian military engineer who is training Thai crews on how to
clear mines along the Cambodian border.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very interested in any technology that takes us away from
the labor-intensive technology that we have now,'' McCracken said
last week from Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   ''Minefields are normally in battlefields, and in battlefields,
there is a lot of scrap metal.'' McCracken said. ''So when you take
a metal detector into a minefield, it's like looking for a needle
in a haystack.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the case of mines encased in wood or plastic, the only
metal is a firing pin the size of a large sewing needle, experts
said. As a result, mine clearers must set their metal detectors on
high sensitivity, leading to false alarms.
</P>
<P>
   Once a mine is located and confirmed with a probe, the de-miner
gently digs soil away from one side, attaches an explosive charge,
leaves the area, and detonates the charge to destroy the mine.
</P>
<P>
   Donskoy's system is among several techniques that Army
researchers said show promise:
</P>
<P>
   --Ground-penetrating radar: Similar to radar used for airborne
objects, it shows buried mines as ''blips'' on a screen. It is in
advanced testing in hand-held and vehicle-based systems, Broach
said.
</P>
<P>
   --Nuclear quadrapole resonance: Also in advanced testing, this
system detects a signal from the chemical bond in explosives by
using a radio frequency electromagnetic field.
</P>
<P>
   ''It does a relatively good job of detecting RDX, one of the
principal explosives used in land mines, but TNT (the other
commonly used explosive) causes a much smaller signal. Also, the
NQR signal is blocked if the mine is encased in metal,'' Harvey
said.
</P>
<P>
   --Chemical sniffing: As the name suggests, this technology gives
machines the ability to ''smell'' buried explosives

<HEADLINE> GOP Gov. Pushes For Tax Cuts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government should follow the lead
of Republican governors who have cut taxes and encouraged school
choice, Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore said Saturday in the party's
Memorial Day weekend radio address.
</P>
<P>
   ''Working men and women in America today need a greater share of
the fruits of their labor,'' Gilmore said.
</P>
<P>
   He said today's Americans pay the highest rate of taxes since
World War II, more than 30 percent of their incomes. Tax cuts, he
said, would help people ''save, invest, create security or even
become entrepreneurs''
</P>
<P>
   ''Republican governors have taken the lead in cutting taxes,''
said Gilmore, such as reductions in Virginia of personal property
taxes on cars and state income taxes for armed forces veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Govs. Frank Keating of Oklahoma and Paul Cellucci of
Massachusetts won the largest tax relief packages in those states,
''empowering working men and women with more financial freedom,''
Gilmore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore, co-chairman of the GOP's national fund-raising and its
campaign-helping Victory 2000 project, also praised George W. Bush,
the Texas governor and presumptive GOP presidential candidate, for
plans to enhance the military and preserve Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Broaching a major Bush campaign topic, Gilmore said his party is
taking the lead on education with its focus on school choice.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are improving education with innovative approaches such as
charter schools,'' said Gilmore. Charter schools are special public
institutions exempted from many state and local regulations in
exchange for improved student performances.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Major Foreign Triumph  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Embarking Monday on perhaps his last official
trip to Europe, President Clinton is running out of time as he
scans the globe in search of a major triumph in arms control,
peacemaking or crisis-solving to mark his place in history.
</P>
<P>
   With only eight months left in Clinton's final term, however,
some experts consider it more likely that he will be remembered not
as a bold architect of post-Cold War diplomacy but as a president
who, distracted by domestic policy and impeachment, was cautious on
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''He probably won't be viewed as a foreign policy president,''
said Miles Kahler, a political scientist at the University of
California, San Diego. ''What is striking is, particularly as
compared to most if not all Cold War presidents, is how little
foreign policy seemed to interest him in any deep way.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sets out Monday night to meet with European Union
officials in Portugal, chat with world leaders at an informal
gathering in Germany and hold his first summit with Russia's new
president, Vladimir Putin. White House expectations are modest.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said the
Moscow visit will produce no breakthroughs in arms control or in
Russian objections to a U.S. missile defense system. Clinton has no
plans to visit Europe again, but he will see Putin several more
times at international meetings before leaving office in January.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential historian Henry Graff said Clinton will be
remembered for his earnestness, his openness and ''his marvelous
persuasive tongue'' in dealing with world leaders. But there were
no really big successes and probably will not be, Graff said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They all look for their place on postage stamps and coins at
this stage,'' Graff said. ''But I don't really think he can do
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Many areas where Clinton stepped in -- the Middle East, the
Balkans, Northern Ireland -- continue to frustrate him, standing as
missions unaccomplished.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq, Saddam Hussein remains in power after defying the
United States and sending U.N. weapons inspectors packing. Haiti,
another trouble spot, still is plagued by corruption, violence and
poverty despite the commitment of 20,000 American troops and
billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In an administration that concentrated so hard on the economy,
it was hardly surprising that some of Clinton's biggest
achievements were in international finance and trade. Berger
boasted that Clinton ''fundamentally changed the global economic
system.''
</P>
<P>
   He helped steady Asia and Mexico after their economies
collapsed. Defying fellow Democrats, Clinton won a major
trade-opening agreement with China, approved by the House last
week, and forged an alliance with Canada and Mexico in the North
American Free Trade Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ''He gets victories when he adopts basically Republican
positions,'' said Kim Holmes, vice president for international
studies at the Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   With support from Republicans, Clinton persuaded NATO to open
its doors to former Soviet satellites Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic. But the GOP also handed Clinton one of his most
humiliating defeats, the Senate's defeat of the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton persuaded Congress to give Russia money to dismantle its
nuclear arsenal but failed to reach agreement with Moscow on
cutting nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   ''After seven years, the U.S. and Russian arsenals pretty much
look like what he inherited,'' said Richard Haass, vice president
and director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings
Institution.
</P>
<P>
   ''He essentially squandered the opportunity that he inherited,''
said Haass. ''What we've seen is seven years of ad hocery in which
there was no set of consistent priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger said Clinton has a strong record.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's been a transformation in the trans-Atlantic
relationship and in Europe,'' Berger said. ''When we arrived here,
people were saying, 'Why do we need NATO?' What's happened? NATO
has been enlarged to embrace new democracies and has in a sense a
new mission of not just protecting against Soviet invasion but of
advancing the common interests of Europe and the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In Bosnia, we found a war, we made a peace,'' Berger said.
''In Kosovo, at the last year of the bloodiest century in history,
the world did not this time stand silent. I think it's a sweeping
record.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kahler, the political scientist, said he was left with a
sense of missed opportunities. ''If we had a president who had more
of a strategic vision about where he wanted relations with Russia
and China to go,'' he said, ''we might have come out in a different
spot.''

<HEADLINE> What Is Israel's Legacy in Lebanon?  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- When Israeli tanks rolled into Lebanon in June
1982, retired army Col. Mordechai Baron volunteered for service
despite misgivings about the mission. He only hoped the foray would
be brief.
</P>
<P>
   It took 18 years for Israel to extricate itself from what became
known to Israelis as the ''botz'' -- mire -- of Lebanon. Baron's
grandson ended up serving there, too, in a tank unit.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's bloody sojourn in Lebanon left an indelible mark on the
nation. During what became a grinding war of attrition, Israel lost
a sense of its own righteousness in battle, and learned its
powerful army is not invincible.
</P>
<P>
   The final troop pullout -- carried out Wednesday with a precision
in sharp contrast to the chaotic days that preceded it -- brought an
enormous sense of collective relief. There was an almost palpable
release of tension as the metal border gate clanged shut behind the
last tank out.
</P>
<P>
   All told, more than 1,000 soldiers died in the conflict, a roll
call of grief and loss that left few untouched in a country of only
6 million people.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Yediot Ahronot ran a two-page black-bordered
spread Friday listing the names of every fallen soldier, together
with a poem by Israel's national poet, Yehuda Amichai. ''We have no
unknown soldiers,'' it was titled.
</P>
<P>
   And so it ended -- or so Israelis hope. No more parents sitting
up at night worrying over sons fighting guerrillas in the
booby-trapped hills of southern Lebanon. No more young soldiers
weeping for comrades at military funerals. No more wrenching
videotape of mangled soldiers being flown from the combat zone.
</P>
<P>
   In a moment of anger just before the pullout, Deputy Defense
Minister Ephraim Sneh said the public's inability to stomach
casualties had sabotaged what he called a successful army mission
to buffer northern Israel from guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are withdrawing due to problems with the ability of Israeli
society to stand firm,'' Sneh complained.
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, argue Lebanon was never a true gauge of Israel's
mettle, because Israeli society was so divided about it from the
start.
</P>
<P>
   The 1982 invasion was Israel's first ''war of choice,'' launched
by then Defense Minister Ariel Sharon to remove Palestine
Liberation Organization bases in Lebanon. The PLO's cross-border
attacks, while often deadly, had never threatened Israel's very
existence, thus distinguishing Lebanon from the major wars Israel
had fought with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Despite then-Prime Minister Menachem Begin's promise the
incursion would pay off with decades of peace, tens of thousands of
anti-war protesters took to the streets.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,000 reserve soldiers asked not to be sent to Lebanon,
including 180 who went to jail for refusing to serve. It was an
unprecedented rebellion against an army that had traditionally been
a revered national symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Ishai Menuchin was a 24-year-old lieutenant in the reserves when
his unit of 30 men was called up about a month into the war.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew something bad was happening here. We had trusted our
leaders, but after the first day, I felt cheated,'' said Menuchin,
a founder of Yesh Gvul, a group of reservists who refuse to serve
in disputed lands.
</P>
<P>
   Menuchin, now a psychologist, spent 35 days in a military jail
after telling commanders he would not report for his next reserve
stint in Lebanon. After that, he was not called back.
</P>
<P>
   While peace activists denounced Israel's involvement in Lebanon,
even supporters had mixed feelings. Shame swept the country in
September 1982 over the massacre of hundreds of Palestinians, many
of them women and children, by Lebanese militiamen allowed into the
Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps by Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
   More than a quarter-million people jammed Tel Aviv's main square
for a protest rally, the largest in the nation's history. Baron,
the retired reservist and a leader of the Peace Now movement, says
his opposition to the war grew the longer the army remained in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not a pacifist -- I don't say war is bad,'' he said. ''But
because I saw atrocities, that's the reason I opposed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon was held indirectly responsible for the Sabra and
Shatilla massacre and stepped down. Begin himself became a poignant
casualty of the conflict: In September 1983, he resigned and went
into seclusion, tormented by guilt over the deaths of more than 600
Israelis in the war.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of the social schism it caused, Lebanon is
sometimes described by commentators as Israel's Vietnam. Others say
that comparison is too facile.
</P>
<P>
   Israel did learn in Lebanon there are limits to what military
force can achieve, said Rachel Ben-Dor, founder of the Four Mothers
grass-roots movement that helped galvanize public opinion in favor
of a withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our society has understood that war is not a solution for
conflicts,'' said Ben-Dor, a college lecturer.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what drove her to activism was the nagging sense that
Israel had become trapped in a needless cycle of violence. ''You
feel you live on borrowed time, that you raise children and can't
give them a future,'' she said, recalling the sleepless nights when
her son Or served as a commando in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone considers Israel's effort in Lebanon a failure.
</P>
<P>
   Commentator Ron Ben-Ishai said the buffer strip set up in 1985
and defended by 1,000 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 Lebanese
militiamen kept down Israeli civilian casualties along the border.
What changed, he said, was the public's willingness to pay the
price for such relative safety.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Lebanon experience left Israel's formidable army a
weakened force is a point of debate.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Ishai said the army, particularly its infantry and field
intelligence units, gained invaluable experience in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   But lessons in low-intensity warfare are of limited use -- unless
you intend to get into another such fight, said Shlomo Brom, a
retired brigadier general and researcher at Tel Aviv University's
Jaffee Center.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the hardships and dangers of serving in Lebanon
became a key rite of passage for young Israelis. Elad Hosstetter, a
high school senior, is among the first wave of recruits in a
generation who won't be serving there -- and he, like others, feels
a twinge of disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Hosstetter, who volunteered for an elite commando unit, said he
felt the withdrawal ''will hurt our image in the eyes of the
Arabs.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he added, perhaps Israeli troops don't really
need to be in Lebanon to defend the northern border.
</P>
<P>
   That's a view now shared by most Israelis, reflecting a
remarkable change in public sentiment. Until about three or four
years ago, a majority accepted the army's argument that a
withdrawal would be possible only if Israel first negotiated peace
treaties with Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Arieh Yitah, a career soldier who fought Lebanese guerrillas for
years, is one of those who had a change of heart, even before his
son Tsahi, a sergeant, was killed in February by a Hezbollah
rocket. Like others, he argued Israel had made its soldiers in
Lebanon sitting ducks.
</P>
<P>
   He says his pain is eased -- if only a little -- by seeing an
ill-fated military strategy finally laid to rest.
</P>
<P>
   ''My son fell where he was put by his country,'' he said. ''What
will make it easier for me is that other soldiers will not die for
nothing.''

<HEADLINE> Black box failure raises questions about charter company's practices </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER NEWTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) -- Answers would do little to cure the
dull, ever-present pain that Debra Maleski feels over the loss of
both her mother and sister in a fiery charter plane crash that
killed all 19 people aboard last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Maleski can't help but feel entitled to an explanation --
any explanation -- as to why the plane's engines cut out, causing
the aircraft that took off from Atlantic City, N.J., to slam into
the rocky terrain of the Pocono Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ''It won't make me feel better, but I do want to know more about
why the plane went down,'' said Maleski, whose family used to run a
bridal boutique in Dunmore. ''It isn't so much about blaming
someone. You just want to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other recent tragedies, crash investigators are
pessimistic about whether the wreckage of the plane Maleski's
mother and sister were aboard will yield definitive answers.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily because its ''black box'' -- a high-tech device that
records all sounds in the cockpit and is required for almost all
passenger planes -- was not operational.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the device raises questions as to whether the
doomed airplane should have been allowed off the runway and whether
the company that owns the plane knew the device was not working.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administration officials say any inspector who
knew a plane did not have a working black box could have grounded
the aircraft, and that the plane's owner, Farmingdale, N.Y.-based
Executive Airlines, may have violated a federal law. Executive
Airlines officials did not return calls for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any plane for hire that is a turbine powered air craft or jet
with six seats or more has to have a cockpit voice recorder,'' said
Les Door, a spokesman for the FAA. ''The box can't just be sitting
there -- the cockpit voice recorder has to record what it is
supposed to record and have a ... means of verifying proper
operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have an early hypothesis about why the recorder
did not work.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's black box operated on DC power and the plane
operated on AC -- meaning the box would have needed a converter to
operate, investigators said. There was no converter found on board,
according to preliminary reports by the National Transportation and
Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the configuration in which we found it, the cockpit
recorder box apparently never would have been able to function,''
said NTSB board member George Black.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials told the NTSB that the box might have been
rewired so no AC/DC converter would be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Executive Airlines requires the pilots to test the box before
the first flight of every day, according to federal investigators.
Any test would have revealed the incompatibility of the device,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   For those receiving word that their loved ones were aboard the
plane, news that the box aboard plane did not record anything came
as a second blow.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was tough, because we want to know what happened,'' said
Peter Daniels, a friend of crash victim Joan E. Kunkle, 63, who
sang in the choir of the First Welsh Presbyterian Church.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think everyone understands that the plane's black box didn't
cause it to crash,'' Kunkle said. ''But just the same, if the plane
should have had a box and it didn't, I think someone should be held
responsible for that. We deserve answers.''
</P>
<P>
   How important is the recorder to investigators?
</P>
<P>
   Recently, investigators have used the devices to shed light on
the circumstances of two major crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials investigating the crash of Alaska Airlines
Flight 261 recently reported that the jet's black box recorded a
loud noise in the minutes before the MD-83 went out of control and
plunged into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The noise was one of two revealed by analysis of the cockpit
voice recorder, said John Hammerschmidt, a member of the National
Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   The plane nose-dived into the Pacific Ocean en route from Puerto
Vallarta, Mexico, to San Francisco on Jan. 31, killing all 88
aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Some time later on the jet's black box, a flight attendant is
heard telling the pilots of a loud noise from the rear of the jet.
</P>
<P>
   A second noise, which was actually recorded by the device, then
sounded just near the end of the tape.
</P>
<P>
   The noises -- and the fact that control was regained after the
first sound -- are consistent with a worsening structural or
mechanical problem in the tail, said William Waldock, associate
director of the Center for Aerospace Safety Education at
Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.
</P>
<P>
   The black box on EgyptAir flight 990 revealed a conversation
between the planes pilots that suggests one of them may have
deliberately crashed the plane on Oct. 31, killing all 217 aboard
including 101 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators of the Wilkes-Barre charter plane crash said the
lack of a working black box ''handicaps'' their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Troubling to some pilots who helped survey the crash site is
their belief that charter companies are more likely to break FAA
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''Charter planes and smaller companies break the rules a lot
more than larger companies that would gain more attention for any
violation,'' said Greg Miller, a former officer of the Professional
Pilots' Association.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that perception is supported in fact is almost
impossible to determine.
</P>
<P>
   FAA inspectors do not track trends in violations -- even though
the agency's regional offices do keep records of the thousands of
violations every year. Door said the information would be of little
use.
</P>
<P>
   ''The data may be there, but it is not something we have a need
for,'' Door said. ''Any violation we would have on record is a
violation we've ensured was dealt with. Our purpose is to gain
compliance of violations we discover.''

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebels Discuss Hostages  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALIPAO, Philippines (AP) -- Sitting barefoot in a circle on the
floor of a mosque, government negotiators and Muslim rebel leaders
held their first talks Saturday on the freedom of 21 hostages who
have been held in a Philippine jungle for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   They did not discuss the immediate release of any of the
hostages, including a German woman suffering from high blood
pressure, said chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado.
</P>
<P>
   Aventajado quickly rejected two of the Abu Sayyaf rebels' main
demands -- an independent Islamic state and a commission to
investigate the treatment of Filipinos in neighboring Malaysia.
Nevertheless, the rebels were ''very reasonable and I am optimistic
that an agreement would be reached pretty soon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages -- three Germans, two French, two Finns, two South
Africans, a Lebanese, nine Malaysians and two Filipinos -- were
snatched from the Malaysian resort of Sipadan on April 23 and taken
by boat to the Philippine island of Jolo, about an hour away.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour of talks, negotiators visited the rebels' mountain
jungle camp and reassured the hostages that they were ''doing
everything'' to resolve the crisis with the Abu Sayyaf, the smaller
and more radical of two guerrilla groups fighting for an Islamic
state in the impoverished southern Philippines, home to the mostly
Catholic nation's Muslim minority.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just hang on,'' Aventajado told the hostages. ''Don't do
anything foolish.''
</P>
<P>
   Captive Risto Vahanen from Finland said, ''The spirit is really
high and we hope to be released in a few days.''
</P>
<P>
   But Vahanen said the group has been ''really disappointed'' by
the slow pace of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just want to be out, all of us,'' said Marie Moarbes, a
hostage from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Frenchman Stephane Loisy then gave Aventajado a gift of a hair
clip made by the hostages out of a coconut shell.
</P>
<P>
   The start of formal talks took a long time because of skirmishes
between the rebels and troops, changes in the government
negotiating team, and the need for security arrangements on the
volatile island.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, both sides agreed to keep the military about five
miles away from the venue in Bandang village in the town of
Talipao.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels guarded a one-mile stretch of the road leading to the
mosque. They stopped a long convoy of vehicles, including three
vans packed with dozens of journalists, and allowed only a few to
pass, including the bulletproof car used by the government
negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the five known leaders of the Abu Sayyaf and all five
government negotiators embraced and kissed each other on the cheeks
before sitting down for talks.
</P>
<P>
   Galib Andang, the most prominent of the rebel leaders, rested an
M-16 rifle with a grenade launcher on his lap.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, heavily armed rebels peered through the windows to
listen to negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Aventajado said an independent Islamic state ''is something we
cannot even discuss with you because if we discuss it, an
impeachment proceeding can proceed because we are allowing the
country to be dismembered.''
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators also discussed rebel demands that foreign
fishing vessels be banned from nearby seas and a commission be
established to look into the plight of Filipinos living in the east
Malaysian state of Sabah near the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Aventajado doused hopes for the commission. He said the
Malaysian ambassador told him ''it's something they could not
possibly do because no government would allow itself to be
investigated.''
</P>
<P>
   Andang told The Associated Press that he and the other rebel
leaders will meet to prepare a formal response.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have informally expressed interest in development
projects such as schools and health centers for their province of
Sulu, a group of islands that includes Jolo, as a more realistic
alternative. They also informally sought as much as $2 million.

<HEADLINE> PEN Condemns Chechnya Campaign  </HEADLINE>
By NICK WADHAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- An influential group of writers from around the
world ended a congress in Moscow on Saturday with a harsh
condemnation of Russia's military campaign in breakaway Chechnya,
accusing the government of masking the truth about the war.
</P>
<P>
   A resolution by the 67th International PEN Congress said the
conflict was having a damaging effect on all of Russian society.
</P>
<P>
   The PEN Congress is ''convinced that all Russian society has
suffered from this war, demoralized by militarization, cruelty,
intolerance, the escalation of violence and grief that have
affected thousands of families all over Russia misled by
propagandist information,'' the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups and Western governments have accused Russian
troops in Chechnya of torture, murder and rape. They say the
government has caused needless civilian casualties in the campaign.
Even so, the campaign is widely popular in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   International PEN, which claims a membership of more than 10,000
writers around the world, advocates freedom of expression and
campaigns for the freedom of writers imprisoned because of their
work.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin defended the military campaign
Saturday, saying the government was not trying to oppress the
Chechen people but had to crack down on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is ''only pursuing a goal of combatting terrorism and
banditry'' Putin said, according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Putin defended Russia's human rights record since
the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union and pledged to protect it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody must be allowed to step back from our victories in the
field of human rights, freedom of business creation, freedom of
speech,'' Putin said in a speech to the Unity political arty. ''Any
citizen of Russia should feel safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The PEN Congress resolution, backed by such influential authors
as Nobel Laureate Guenter Grass of Germany, demanded that Russia
immediately stop fighting and begin negotiations with ''those
forces in Chechnya ... who are ready for a peaceful solution to the
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has said repeatedly that it would consider negotiations
only if the rebels give up their claims of independence, surrender
their arms and turn over any alleged hostage takers or murderers.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the Russian forces, Gen. Gennady Troshev, said
on NTV television Saturday that a referendum should be held in
Chechnya to determine who could negotiate with the Russian
government. But he ruled out any talks with rebel leaders, saying
they didn't want peace anyway.
</P>
<P>
   He repeated Russia's claim that the military campaign will not
stop until Russia is victorious.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Chechnya, rebels staged more than a dozen attacks on
Russian military facilities over the past 24 hours, while Russian
warplanes attacked militants' bases in the southern mountains, the
military command said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces carrying out reconnaissance and search operations
in the south seized a large cache of rebel weapons in the Argun
gorge, the military command press center said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia launched its offensive in Chechnya in September, after
Islamic militants seized villages in the neighboring Russian region
of Dagestan. Moscow also blamed Chechens for four apartment
bombings in Russia that killed about 300 people.

<HEADLINE> Fiji's President Gives Ground  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Fiji's president signaled Saturday that he was
accepting two main demands of rebels holding the prime minister and
about 30 others hostage: a new government and immunity from
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara said he has fired the
democratically elected government of Prime Minister Mahendra
Chaudhry, who has been held captive by an armed gang for 10 days
inside the parliament compound.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came several hours after two soldiers and a
journalist were injured in a gun battle outside parliament between
rebels and Fijian soldiers. The president said the timing was
unrelated.
</P>
<P>
   Mara, a figurehead who normally holds little government power,
said he would appoint a caretaker administration by Monday, and
would continue to rule the Pacific nation until then through
state-of-emergency powers.
</P>
<P>
   The president also said it was ''highly likely'' that rebel
leader George Speight and the six gunmen who stormed parliament on
May 19 would be granted immunity from prosecution for their roles
in the coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
   But Mara did not accept the rebels' third demand -- that he
resign as president.
</P>
<P>
   Speight did not immediately respond to Mara's actions.
</P>
<P>
   Mara acknowledged it would look like he was caving in, but said
that he had no choice and that his plan was the last hope for a
''constitutionally viable route'' to end the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted that if the plan is accepted, Fiji would become an
international pariah. Main trading partner Australia as well as New
Zealand, the United States and the United Nations have condemned
any deal that replaces the elected government as giving in to
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign nations have threatened to impose economic and
diplomatic sanctions. Mara warned that Fiji's main industries of
sugarcane growing and tourism would collapse under sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to face not only purgatory, but hell,'' Mara
said.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry, who was elected prime minister last year, is the
country's first leader of Indian ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   Speight claims to be acting on behalf of the majority indigenous
Fijians, and wants to reduce the powers that Indians can have in
the government. He has declared himself prime minister and
appointed his own cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   The gun battle Saturday began after some 200 rebel supporters
and at least three armed rebels left the parliament compound. On
the way out, one said: ''We're going to take down the roadblocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Confronting about eight soldiers at a roadblock 400 yards from
the compound, the supporters tried to grab the soldiers' weapons
and pushed one of them to the ground. The other soldiers fired
warning shots. Rebels shot back, setting off a gun battle that
lasted for less than five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers withdrew and were chased by the rebels and their
supporters, who threw rocks and carried machetes. The mob
eventually returned to parliament, marching, singing a song and
carrying army tents they had pulled down.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said one soldier was hit in the shoulder and the other
in the leg. Jerry Harmer, 38, of Britain, a senior producer and
cameraman for Associated Press Television News, was shot in the
right wrist. Doctors at Suva's Colonial War Memorial hospital said
his condition was good.
</P>
<P>
   Speight did not appear to be involved in the confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Army commander Commodore Frank Bainimarama said his soldiers
could not stop the armed rebels because they were using unarmed
supporters as human shields.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji, which had two bloodless coups in 1987, is an island nation
in the Pacific 2,250 miles northeast of Sydney, Australia. Fijians
of Indian ancestry make up 44 percent of the population of 813,000,
while indigenous Fijians account for 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Indians own many shops and businesses in Fiji. Some
ethnic Indians have been attacked since Speight's coup began.

<HEADLINE> Two Bodies Found at Chaplin Mansion  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Two bodies have been found on the
grounds of a mansion near Lake Geneva that belongs to the family of
silent movie star Charlie Chaplin, police said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The decomposed remains of a man and a woman were found in the
park that surrounds the Manoir de Ban mansion in the village of
Corsier. The remains were taken to a clinic in Lausanne for
autopsies, police said, confirming a report in the Lausanne daily
24 Heures.
</P>
<P>
   Police gave no information on their identity or cause of death,
although there appeared to be no link to the Chaplin family. An
investigation has been opened.
</P>
<P>
   Fire service officials at the scene said one of the victims had
been hanged. They were found Friday evening after the estate
gardener alerted Michael Chaplin, the movie star's son, to an
unpleasant odor.
</P>
<P>
   Chaplin told Swiss radio Saturday he had found ''a man hanging
from a tree and, a little further on, a woman whose head was
separated from her body'' in woodland on the property's grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Chaplin lived in Corsier from 1953 until his death in
1977.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Police Recover Stolen Koran  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) -- Turkish Cypriot police said Saturday they
have recovered a 15th-century Koran that was stolen from a Turkish
museum and detained three suspects for attempting to smuggle the
book to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The handwritten Islamic holy book had been missing from the
Istanbul's Topkapi Palace museum since September. The theft, from
the former home of the sultans and one of the world's most visited
museums, shocked Turks and prompted an investigation into lax
security measures at Turkey's museums.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a tip, police in the breakaway state detained one of
the suspects as he attempted to board a plane for Britain, said
Chief Inspector Salim Aker. Two other men, who allegedly stole the
Koran from Topkapi, were also detained.
</P>
<P>
   The men arrived in northern Cyprus from Turkey on May 25. Cyprus
has been divided in Greek and Turkish sectors since a 1974 Turkish
invasion.
</P>
<P>
   The men, whose identities were not released, planned to sell the
Koran to a company dealing in antiquities, Aker said.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish police thought they had recovered the book in January
when they arrested four men trying to sell an antique Koran, but
experts said it was not the missing Topkapi Koran.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the theft, authorities estimated the value of the
handwritten Koran at between $5,000 and $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Topkapi Palace, which overlooks the bustling Bosporus Strait and
the Golden Horn, was home to the Ottoman sultans and their court
from the mid-15th century to the mid-19th century.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President To Resign  </HEADLINE>
By SARI BASHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's beleaguered President Ezer Weizman
will resign within six weeks, his top aide said Saturday, three
days after the attorney general said that he improperly accepted
gifts while in public office.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman has informed Prime Minister Ehud Barak of his decision,
the aide, Arieh Shumer, said.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman, 76, has said he will resign sometime this year, citing
ill health and the implications of a police investigation into over
$300,000 in gifts that he took from French millionaire Edouard
Sarousi between 1988 and 1993, while he was a legislator and
Cabinet minister. The president says the money was a personal gift.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein on Wednesday announced that
he was closing the investigation, but only because the
statute-of-limitations on bribery charges had run out, and police
did not find enough evidence to indict Weizman for malfeasance in
office.
</P>
<P>
   Rubinstein, however, said ''there was clear impropriety in
receiving the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Calls for the president's resignation reached a crescendo
following Rubinstein's report.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman, a former air force commander and defense minister, is
serving his second five-year term, due to expire in 2003. He said
he had planned to retire May 10, which is Israel's Independence
Day, but postponed that decision until Rubinstein issued his final
report.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman, the Jewish state's first Israeli-born president, has
annoyed politicians from both left and right by bluntly and
publicly letting them know when he disagreed with how they were
running the country. Yet many Israelis felt his straight-talking,
shoot-from-the-hip style represented their pushy, boisterous
society.
</P>
<P>
   Cabinet Minister Shimon Peres, a former prime minister and Nobel
Peace laureate, is a leading candidate for the post of president,
which is mostly ceremonial. The opposition Likud Party is expected
to nominate lawmaker and former minister Moshe Katzav as its
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The president is chosen by an anonymous vote in the Knesset,
Israel's parliament.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Applauds N. Ireland Vote  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton welcomed the decision of
Northern Ireland's Protestants to revive their power-sharing
government with the region's Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am delighted that, with today's historic developments, the
Northern Ireland peace process is back on track,'' Clinton said in
a statement Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the vote by the grass-roots council of the Ulster
Unionist Party to bring back the arrangement was a ''giant step''
toward fulfilling the 1998 U.S.-mediated peace agreement. It
established a power-sharing government with representatives of
pro-British Northern Ireland unionists and Sinn Fein, the mainly
Roman Catholic party linked to the outlawed Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is now possible for the politics of conflict to be
transformed into the politics of consensus,'' Clinton said. ''The
wind is back in the sails of peace in Northern Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke by phone with five of the major participants in
the peace process: Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, Sinn Fein
president Gerry Adams, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Irish
Prime Minister Bertie Ahern and Seamus Mallon, the senior Catholic
politician in Northern Ireland's disbanded cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ''He congratulated them for the work to get the Northern Ireland
peace process back on track and said it's a win-win situation for
everyone,'' White House spokesman Mike Hammer said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's narrow vote clears the way for Britain to transfer
substantial power back to local hands in Northern Ireland. That
power was stripped after the IRA refused to make firm commitments
toward disarmament. Three weeks ago, the IRA agreed to put its
weapons stockpiles ''beyond use.''

</P>
<P>
   While the couple was trying to leave with their purchases, a
thief decided the commotion would provide good cover for him to
sneak out of the store with a television.
</P>
<P>
   Security alarms went off, and employees grabbed the alleged
crook. But not before Littrell and Wallace were also briefly
detained.

<HEADLINE> Separatist Leader in India Killed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAUHATI, India (AP) -- Security forces gunned down a top
separatist leader in India's northeastern state of Assam on
Saturday, and rebels killed six members of a family in a separate
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Swadhinata Phukan, the publicity secretary of the United
Liberation Front of Asom, known as ULFA, was shot and killed in a
gunbattle with paramilitary soldiers in Gorumara, a village 192
miles east of Gauhati, the state capital, a police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''His death will be a big blow to the ULFA as he is one of the
think tanks of the outfit,'' Umesh Kumar, deputy inspector general
of eastern Assam, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   The ULFA guerrillas have been fighting security forces for a
separate homeland in Assam, a tea-growing state which is also rich
in oil. More than 10,000 people have been killed in two decades of
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a group of 20 heavily armed ULFA militants shot and
killed six Nepalis on Saturday while they were asleep in their home
in Mogum Pathar, 330 miles east of Gauhati.
</P>
<P>
   Police said there were reports that the family had received
demands for money by the ULFA a few days ago.

<HEADLINE> Man charged in 1998 murder of renowned Catskills pianist  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   THOMPSON, N.Y. (AP) -- Police say they have solved the 1998
murder of a renowned pianist whose bones were found in Sullivan
County last year.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Van Dunk, 23, has been charged with two counts of
second-degree murder for fatally striking 67-year-old Angelo
Barbaria in the head with a large rock.
</P>
<P>
   Van Dunk is a convicted burglar who was on parole at the time of
the murder, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Barbaria, who was a well known pianist during the heyday of the
Catskills resort scene, was reported missing Sept. 8, 1998 by a
niece who was supposed to meet him for a trip to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1999 a hiker in Thompson Town Park found a jaw bone
that was identified as Barbaria's. Police dogs found the rest of
his skeleton and some clothing nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Barbaria's sister, Gloria Fecher of Queens, N.Y., said her
brother ''had money and traveler's checks for his trip right in the
car and he (the killer) didn't take anything.''
</P>
<P>
   A credit card purchase was made in New Jersey with Barbaria's
card the night of the murder, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was told that my brother met him (Van Dunk) and his
girlfriend at a laundromat once,'' Fecher said. ''Then my brother
recognized him walking down the road and gave him a lift. They
must've gotten into a terrible argument where he (Van Dunk) got
enraged and did that terrible deed.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days after Barbaria disappeared, his white Chrysler
convertible turned up in the parking lot of a car dealer. His
vanity license plates -- 88AB, the number of keys on a piano and his
initials -- helped identify the car.
</P>
<P>
   Police later discovered that his luggage and airline ticket had
never left the bedroom of his trailer home in Loch Sheldrake.
</P>
<P>
   After a 20 month investigation that involved interviewing
hundreds of people -- including most of Barbaria's neighbors --
police were able to match finger prints on the passenger window of
Barbaria's car with Van Dunk.
</P>
<P>
   Barbaria lived in the Catskill resort region for 25 years,
performing at famous Borscht Belt hotels like The Concord,
Grossinger's and Villa Roma. He also played at clubs in Florida and
New York City and toured with comedian Imogene Coca.
</P>
<P>
   Barbaria also made an appearance in the original ''Godfather''
film, playing himself in a Las Vegas show scene.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the scene the Godfather says he wants no music and no girls
around and asks Angelo to leave,'' Fecher said.
</P>
<P>
   Following his retirement, Barbaria played shows, often for free,
for senior citizens in nursing homes or in retirement communities,
Fecher said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was so caring,'' she said. ''The type that always bought a
poor homeless person on the street a bite to eat.''

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Army Placed on Alert  </HEADLINE>
By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The Yugoslav army has reportedly
been placed on higher alert against domestic and foreign enemies,
reflecting growing tensions generated by the confrontation between
President Slobodan Milosevic and his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Vijesti, a daily in Yugoslavia's republic of Montenegro, on
Saturday published what it said was a copy of a classified military
document that called on troops to watch for ''foreign enemies,
together with certain opposition forces ... conducting propaganda
with the aim to topple the legally elected authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Vijesti cited orders signed by Lt. Gen. Milorad Obradovic, the
commander of Yugoslav Army's Second Corps that covers Montenegro
and most of the rest of southern Yugoslavia. The orders told troops
to be ''most decisive and use all measures in case of
provocation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav army did not respond Saturday to a request to
confirm the Vijesti report.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, meanwhile, about 15,000 people gathered in the
Serbian capital to rally against the president, the latest of daily
demonstrations demanding his resignation. No incidents were
immediately reported.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the most recent confrontation has played out in Serbia,
the larger Yugoslav republic that is his power base. But the
Vijesti report reflected the general increase in tensions gripping
all of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro's pro-Western leadership is supportive of the
anti-Milosevic movement in Serbia, seeing it as strengthening its
efforts for autonomy, if not outright independence.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Milosevic, including the Yugoslav army, frequently
lump together the Serbian opposition, Montenegro's leaders and
Western powers, equating their efforts to weaken the Yugoslav
president to treason.
</P>
<P>
   Internal bickering among a dozen opposition leaders has enabled
Milosevic to survive politically, despite his role in the
disintegration of Yugoslavia and Serbia's loss of its Kosovo
province last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The battle against the rigid, arrogant and primitive
authorities cannot be waged ... from offices, with press releases,
without really knowing people in the streets,'' said an editorial
in the independent Danas daily on Saturday, suggesting that
opposition leaders were out of touch with ordinary Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to counter such disaffection, Zoran Djindjic, one of the
opposition leaders, pledged a program of organized resistance
within five days ''against the criminals who want to kill us all.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone who is attacked will try to defend himself, his
neighbors and friends will help, his town will defend him, the
whole nation will help,'' Djindjic said.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested round-the-clock presence of opposition supporters
in the offices of nongovernment media still operating, adding: ''If
police tries to take over a local television station, the whole
town will declare civil disobedience.''
</P>
<P>
   Both he and a rival opposition leader, Vuk Draskovic, reiterated
plans to travel to Russia on Monday to attempt to persuade Moscow
to turn from Milosevic and fully back Serbian opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past week, police have responded to protests against
Milosevic's sweeping crackdown on nongovernment media in Serbia
with beatings and arrests of opposition supporters.
</P>
<P>
   At least a dozen pro-democracy activists were arrested in
several Serbian towns on Saturday, some for handing out opposition
party leaflets in the streets.

<HEADLINE> Koreans Battle US Air Force Range  </HEADLINE>
By SANG-HUN CHOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOON-NI RANGE, South Korea (AP) -- Old fishermen call them
''shriekers'' -- U.S. military jets that swoop down and strafe
practice targets only 550 yards from the nearest village.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole house shakes. I can't watch TV. Babies are
startled,'' said Choi Joong-bin, 64. ''It gets worse in the summer
when I have to leave the windows open.''
</P>
<P>
   Choi is among several thousand people here who say they cannot
sleep or work in comfort as long as the United States, their
country's main military ally, keeps an air force range near their
west coast village of Mae Hyang, 50 miles south of Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers say the 5,000-acre Koon-Ni tidal flat range is the
cause of deaths, injuries and miscarriages among humans and
livestock. They say at least nine people have died in accidents
linked to the range, including a pregnant woman killed when a
practice bomb hit her in 1967 and four children killed the
following year when they tinkered with an unexploded bomb. In 1994,
they say, roofs caved in and walls cracked in 100 houses when range
workers accidentally detonated bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, a May 8 bombing slightly injured several
villagers and cracked walls or shattered windows of hundreds of
homes, villagers say. More than 100 students were detained in
subsequent days for trying to march on the U.S. embassy in Seoul to
demand the relocation of the range and the withdrawal of U.S.
troops from the South.
</P>
<P>
   At South Korean President Kim Dae-jung's urging, U.S. officials
halted firing on the range for 10 days during a joint
investigation. Investigators say they have not found evidence of
major damage or injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,800 residents from 10 villages around the range have
filed a lawsuit seeking $27 million in compensation from their
government.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to live in peace!'' barks a slogan painted by
villagers on a cinderblock warehouse overlooking the tidal flat.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military has about 20 bases scattered around South
Korea and operates several ranges. Washington also still keeps
37,000 troops in the South. Under a treaty, Seoul must provide the
U.S. military with land for its facilities, but no provinces want
the range in their backyards.
</P>
<P>
   The Koon-Ni range opened during the 1950-53 Korean War, when
U.S. troops led U.N. forces to fight North Korean invaders. It used
to consist of three islets and a beach where huge bulls-eye targets
are held up by poles for strafing exercises by U.S. helicopters and
jets. Repeated bombing has flattened an islet into the tidal flat.
A second island is all but gone.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. jets now practice war on a third island, firing rockets and
strafing discarded cars used as targets, five days a week from 9
a.m. to 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military considers the range essential for preparation
against any threat from communist North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ''In order to help defend South Korea, as we are requested by
the South Korean government, we do need to be trained and we need
areas where we are allowed to train,'' said Lee Ferguson,
spokeswoman for the U.S. military command.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and South Korean authorities have made little progress with
the villagers. A government offer to relocate the villagers' homes
was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   On weekends, bombing stops and villagers collect oysters along
the tidal flat, which is strewn with practice shells, rusty bullets
and bomb shreds.
</P>
<P>
   ''You feel angry but helpless when at night, planes thunder
overhead and your baby wakes up and cries out,'' Chun Man-kyu, 45,
said as he trudged the flat.

<HEADLINE> Putin Reappoints Chief-of-Staff  </HEADLINE>
By NICK WADHAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin quietly reappointed the
controversial Kremlin chief-of-staff Saturday, the strongest sign
yet that he won't sever ties with the powerful circle of advisers
of his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Voloshin, the presidential chief-of-staff, was a
central figure in the group of businessmen and politicians who made
up the so-called ''Family'' of advisers who wielded enormous power
under Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Russian and Swiss investigators have probed allegations linking
members of Yeltsin's family and top Kremlin aides to alleged
kickbacks for lucrative government contracts and money laundering.
No charges have been made in connection with the probes.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who was named acting president by Yeltsin and won
elections in March, vowed to crack down on the corruption that
pervades the government and many parts of Russian society. His
untainted image and promises to punish corruption were key to his
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Russian politicians and analysts had been waiting to see if
Putin would rehire Voloshin and other senior figures from the
previous administration as a test of whether he would act
independently and tackle the corruption that blossomed under
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin has reappointed most of the ministers and senior
officials from the old government. Since he was inaugurated on May
7, Putin has focused on consolidating the Kremlin's power.
</P>
<P>
   Voloshin's reappointment was likely to worry those Russians who
had hoped that Putin's election would signal the end of the power
and influence of the tiny circle of politicians and tycoons who
have dominated Russian politics since the Soviet collapse in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's former chief prosecutor, Yuri Skuratov, who was
involved in the corruption probes, alleged earlier this year that
there was evidence of wrongdoing involving Voloshin.
</P>
<P>
   ''The entire Kremlin inner circle has problems with the law,''
Skuratov said at a news conference in February. Evidence of
wrongdoing ''has been lying unasked for without any checking,'' he
said. ''I don't say they are criminals, but all this evidence must
be thoroughly investigated.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin attempted to dismiss Skuratov, who was himself
implicated in corruption allegations. Putin secured Skuratov's
dismissal after he took over.
</P>
<P>
   News of Voloshin's reappointment late Saturday suggested the
Kremlin wanted to minimize the announcement. Russia does not have
Sunday newspapers and weekend TV and radio announcements are
shorter than during the week.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, Putin reappointed Sergei Ivanov as secretary of
Russia's Security Council. Ivanov, like Putin, used to work in the
Federal Security Service, the chief successor to the KGB.
</P>
<P>
   Announcements of the appointments were carried by Russian news
agencies and TV networks.
</P>
<P>
   In another decree Putin signed Saturday, the Security Council
will now include the presidential representatives of Russia's seven
new super-districts. Putin announced a plan earlier this month to
divide the country into seven districts to boost federal control.
</P>
<P>
   Putin sought Saturday to reassure the elected governors of
Russia's 89 regions that the new federal districts were intended to
improve government efficiency, not to weaken the governors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to stress and repeat that the purpose is not to
interfere in the internal affairs of the regions but to ensure more
efficient work of federal structures,'' Putin said in a meeting
with 16 governors from Siberia, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has also introduced draft laws that would remove regional
governors from the upper house of parliament and allow the
president to fire them if they violate federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Those moves have been interpreted as attempts by Putin to wrest
control away from the governors, who acted with little federal
oversight under Yeltsin, sometimes passing laws that contradict the
federal Constitution.

<HEADLINE> Spitzer: United-US Airways deal could be bad for New York  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The proposed buyout of US Airways by United
Airlines raises ''serious'' concerns about lessened competition
because the merged company would dominate at most New York
airports, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer says.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways and United would control nearly a third of the
passenger traffic and landing spots at LaGuardia Airport in New
York City if the acquisition goes through, and about 50 percent of
the traffic at both Hancock Airport in Syracuse and at the Albany
International Airport, Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A 50 percent market share will raise the eyebrows of an
antitrust lawyer,'' Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   The two airlines currently carry about 46 percent of passengers
at the Buffalo-Niagara International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter dated Friday to United Chief Executive Officer James
Goodwin and US Airways Chairman Stephen Wolf, Spitzer asked both
airlines for various documents concerning the proposed acquisition,
including analysis and cost-efficiency studies of Northeastern and
New York state markets.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said his office's antitrust bureau would handle the
inquiry into the ramifications of the $4.3 billion cash buyout of
US Airways.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Spitzer said it appears to him the merger ''has
the potential to substantially diminish competition in the upstate
airline market,'' a market which he noted is already beset by
extremely high fares for the relatively short flights between major
upstate cities.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any diminution in competition would be a blow to the upstate
economy,'' Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would like his antitrust experts to finish their
analysis of the effects of a US Airways sale within several weeks.
His office will also be working with other attorneys general and
the U.S. Justice Department in evaluating the potential impacts of
the acquisition, Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York attorney general said there is an ''enormous
amount'' he can do to affect the proposed sale if the competition
concerns prove valid.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can stop the merger,'' Spitzer said. ''I'm not saying we
will, but we could.''
</P>
<P>
   United spokesman Joe Hopkins said the Elkgrove Village,
Ill.-based airline is prepared to address any antitrust issues
raised by the proposed acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will respond to the attorney general and provide answers to
each of the issues that he is raising,'' Hopkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence M. Nagin, U.S. Airway's executive vice president for
corporate affairs and general counsel, said, ''We look forward to
cooperating with all authorities'' reviewing the acquisition of his
Arlington, Va.-based airline.

<HEADLINE> Rattlesnakes take to the water  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GORMLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE GEORGE, N.Y. (AP) -- The image of rattlesnakes as dusty
desert dwellers in the Southwest clashes with the reality of dens
from the lush Northeast to both coasts where they live and, for
reasons still mostly unknown, swim.
</P>
<P>
   New York state's upper Lake George is one of these areas. Ten to
20 miles north of the village beach, a rare few Eastern Timber
Rattlesnakes slither down the steep southern Adirondack mountains
on the lake's heavily forested west side to swim to more than 50
island campgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   You don't find this in glossy chamber of commerce booklets. But
the infrequent trek is repeated by rattlesnakes 3 to almost 5 feet
long and thicker than a man's grip here and anywhere water is
located near rattlesnake dens. The snakes, fearful of people,
slither in the water far from the public beaches. Very few tourists
or locals have seen one and none have been bitten.
</P>
<P>
   ''It happens all over the country in lakes and rivers with all
types of rattlesnakes,'' said William Brown, a biologist who
started studying rattlesnakes in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers report the timid rattlers swimming in spots as
diverse as southern Lake Champlain, the Catskills' Delaware River
between New York and Pennsylvania, a southern stretch of Hudson
River, swamps and lakes near Syracuse and Rochester. They also swim
the Florida Keys and off the California coast. On Lake George, a
naturalist reported a swimming rattlesnake in 1749. Sporadic
mentions followed in accounts of French and Indian War battles at
Fort William Henry that overlooks the ''Queen of American Lakes.''
</P>
<P>
   On Lake George's main street, the Tom Tom Shop and others offer
everything touristy from imitation moccasins to souvenir T-shirts
depicting trout, bears, wolves (extinct here since the 1800s), and
beavers. No rattlesnakes. Business owners reacted with ''What
rattlesnakes?''
</P>
<P>
   In part, that's because spotting swimming rattlesnakes is rare
even for researchers -- and far more of a danger to the snake than
to people. Encountering one on the trail or in the water is rarer
still, particularly because the snakes are quick to flee. Science
journals and volumes of study devote a few sentences or a few pages
among hundreds to the swimming snakes.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Reynolds, 11, knows more than most. His mom saw one
crossing to an island. And Eric's fishing buddy, Jake Nelson, 9,
says his friend Zack talks about seeing a couple rattlesnakes in
the lake.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's weird,'' Nelson said, casting plastic worms in a chilly
spring drizzle into the lake. Neither boy, though, is worried about
the rattlers on trails or in the lake.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think they can attack while they're swimming,'' said
Reynolds. ''I don't usually worry about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither boy has heard in the local lore of anyone being bitten
in the 32-mile lake.
</P>
<P>
   Neither have the protective, even secretive scientists who study
the timid snakes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The chance of running into one while swimming is so close to
zero,'' said Al Breisch, amphibian and reptiles specialist for the
state Department of Environmental Conservation. ''On Lake George
you're much more likely to get hit by a jet ski.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have records of them swimming at least 1 mile across Lake
George,'' Breisch said. Food might be the motive, but it isn't a
migration.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said rattlesnakes swim the most in mid-July because it's
mating season. Then, rattlesnakes can travel up to 4 miles. But the
swimming begins shortly after the rattlesnakes become active in
late spring on the uninhabited hiking mountains. Swimming continues
into September.
</P>
<P>
   Brown suggests the single-minded rattlesnakes simply hunt along
a straight line. If that line goes into the lake so does the snake.
On Lake George's dozens of popular islands, three to four snakes a
summer are typically recovered by state rangers. They are given to
Brown for study, marking and release on the mountain. Some summers
he gets five to six. Although there's no telling how many snakes
visit the islands 65 miles north of Albany that include 50 islands
with state campsites, Brown thinks the total isn't much more than
the number of snakes he receives.
</P>
<P>
   ''Champ,'' for example, visited the same island six straight
years, Brown said. One year, Champ summered there at least four or
five times.
</P>
<P>
   ''He obviously enjoyed that island, foraged around and had a
good time there,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Virtually all of the islands have been visited by
rattlesnakes,'' said Brown, professor emeritus at Skidmore College
in Saratoga Springs. He collects rattlesnakes 50 to 70 days a year
on land. ''They can bite (when swimming), but you have to want to
be bitten.''
</P>
<P>
   The risk, Brown insists, is for the snakes.
</P>
<P>
   There remains remnants of the bounty hunting in the 19th century
at $5 a head that didn't end legally until 1971. That devastated
the population of low-reproducing snakes. Swimming to populated
islands adds to that death rate when frightened campers kill the
legally protected snakes.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's always a threat,'' Brown said. ''And to some extent
they're bringing it on themselves as they go to islands ... but
that's been going on for 8,000 years now in the northern climates
since the glaciers withdrew. Humans have been here just 200
years.''

<HEADLINE> 'Survivor' Contestants Engage Rats  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The first night on the desolate island that was
home to CBS's reality show ''Survivor'' could have been enough to
send less adventurous souls packing.
</P>
<P>
   Some contestants got bitten by rats, said Sean Kenniff of
Massapequa, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had to sleep on some boards on the sand the first night,
and the rats came right up and nibbled on us. I got bitten on my

   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The proposed buyout of US Airways by United
Airlines raises ''serious'' concerns about lessened competition
because the merged company would dominate at most New York
airports, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer says.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways and United would control nearly a third of the
passenger traffic and landing spots at LaGuardia Airport in New
York City if the acquisition goes through, and about 50 percent of
the traffic at both Hancock Airport in Syracuse and at the Albany
International Airport, Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A 50 percent market share will raise the eyebrows of an
antitrust lawyer,'' Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   The two airlines currently carry about 46 percent of passengers
at the Buffalo-Niagara International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter dated Friday to United Chief Executive Officer James
Goodwin and US Airways Chairman Stephen Wolf, Spitzer asked both
airlines for various documents concerning the proposed acquisition,
including analysis and cost-efficiency studies of Northeastern and
New York state markets.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said his office's antitrust bureau would handle the
inquiry into the ramifications of the $4.3 billion cash buyout of
US Airways.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Spitzer said it appears to him the merger ''has
the potential to substantially diminish competition in the upstate
airline market,'' a market which he noted is already beset by
extremely high fares for the relatively short flights between major
upstate cities.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any diminution in competition would be a blow to the upstate
economy,'' Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would like his antitrust experts to finish their
analysis of the effects of a US Airways sale within several weeks.
His office will also be working with other attorneys general and
the U.S. Justice Department in evaluating the potential impacts of
the acquisition, Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York attorney general said there is an ''enormous
amount'' he can do to affect the proposed sale if the competition
concerns prove valid.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can stop the merger,'' Spitzer said. ''I'm not saying we
will, but we could.''
</P>
<P>
   United spokesman Joe Hopkins said the Elkgrove Village,
Ill.-based airline is prepared to address any antitrust issues
raised by the proposed acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will respond to the attorney general and provide answers to
each of the issues that he is raising,'' Hopkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence M. Nagin, U.S. Airway's executive vice president for
corporate affairs and general counsel, said, ''We look forward to
cooperating with all authorities'' reviewing the acquisition of his
Arlington, Va.-based airline.

<HEADLINE> Key Facts About Peru  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Key facts about Peru, which holds a runoff ballot to
elect the
president Sunday:
<TEXT>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ELECTION SUNDAY: More than 14 million voters are registered to
take part in the presidential election. President Alberto Fujimori,
seeking an unprecedented third five-year term faces Alejandro
Toledo, who says he is boycotting the vote. He has instructed his
supporters to invalidate their ballots by marking them with the
words ''no to fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATES:
</P>
<P>
   --Alberto Fujimori, 61, was first elected in 1990 as a political
unknown. He seized dictatorial powers in April 1992, dissolving
Congress and closing the courts. A new constitution was written and
a new Congress elected, dominated by his supporters. He was
re-elected in 1995 by Peruvians grateful to him for stemming
guerrilla violence and ending the economic chaos of the 1980s. His
supporters in Congress removed a constitutional barrier to a third
consecutive term with a questionable law and fired three
Constitutional Tribunal judges who objected to the move.
</P>
<P>
   --Alejandro Toledo, 54, is a politically moderate economist
educated in the United States. He is supported mostly by a mix of
poor urban migrants and middle-class Peruvians disenchanted with
Fujimori's inability to produce jobs and higher wages during 10
years of rule.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   COUNTRY: Slightly larger than Alaska, Peru is the third largest
country in South America. Flanked by the Pacific Ocean to the west,
it is bordered by Ecuador and Colombia to the north, Brazil and
Bolivia to the east, and Chile to the South. More than 30 percent
of the population of 25 million lives in the capital, Lima. Peru is
divided into three geographical regions: the coastal desert, the
Andean highlands and the Amazon jungle.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ECONOMY: In the early 1990s, Fujimori tamed hyperinflation,
reversed Peru's pariah image with international lenders and
implemented liberal, free market policies with remarkable success.
Growth averaged more than 7 percent annually, but the trend ended
in his second term, as Asian financial turmoil spread throughout
Latin America and Peru was rocked by the El Nino weather
phenomenon. About half the population lives in poverty and only one
in two people in the labor force has steady work.

<HEADLINE> Fujimori Counting on Peru's Poor  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORCON, Peru (AP) -- Indian peasants in this farming village in
the lush, green mountains of northern Peru will be voting en masse
for President Alberto Fujimori in Sunday's presidential runoff.
They're not worried about vote fraud or the threat of international
isolation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are for Fujimori,'' said Elena Castrellon Julca, who
sported the tall straw hat popular with Indians in this region.
''He has built a health post and a new hotel on the hill for
tourists who want to visit. The people are going to vote for him,
for certain.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori is counting on solid support among Peru's poor
majority, people like Castrellon, to weather the international
storm provoked by the refusal of election officials to postpone the
flawed runoff.
</P>
<P>
   The 61-year-old Fujimori, known as ''The Emperor'' for his
autocratic style, is running alone, disregarding a boycott by
opposition candidate Alejandro Toledo, violent street protests and
the withdrawal of foreign monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori is seeking a third five-year term despite a
constitutional ban on three consecutive terms. Speaking Saturday,
Toledo said the refusal of election officials to postpone the
runoff ''announced the death of democracy in Peru.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticism continued as Fujimori headed toward certain victory --
but also a possible future of international isolation and domestic
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union announced Saturday it was withdrawing its
observers, saying Toledo's decision not to participate ''deprives
this election of every element of democratic competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Santistevan, Peru's public ombudsman, added his voice:
''We don't think enough improvements have been made to carry out
free and competitive elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of American States said Friday it was reducing
its observer mission to a minimum because, by international
standards, Peru's electoral process is tainted.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton urged Peru on Friday to postpone the runoff,
saying that without a delay, there is no way to ensure the election
is fair. He warned that relations with Peru ''inevitably will be
affected'' if fraud occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign monitors wanted a delay to be able to evaluate new
software for tabulating votes. During the first round election
officials could not satisfactorily explain how the number of
ballots cast exceeded the number of voters by more than 1.4
million.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori won 49.9 percent of the vote, just shy of the majority
he needed to avoid a runoff against Toledo, who collected 40.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Downplaying the threat of international sanctions, Prime
Minister Alberto Bustamante said the absence of foreign observers
''in no way affects the validity and legitimacy of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Fujimori could probably defeat Toledo easily in a
clean election. Three opinion surveys in recent days gave Fujimori
a comfortable lead of eight to 10 percentage points over the
U.S.-educated economist.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters said Toledo's ambivalence -- insisting he was still a
candidate but would not take part in Sunday's runoff -- had confused
voters. Since voting is obligatory, Toledo urged voters to spoil
their ballots in protest.
</P>
<P>
   ''I voted for Toledo in the first round because he promised to
create decent jobs,'' said Zozimo Chagua, 36, who runs a newsstand
in Lima's San Isidro banking district. ''But on Sunday I'm going to
vote for Fujimori because you can't trust Toledo. One day he says
one thing and the next day something else.''
</P>
<P>
   In Porcon, villagers have never had any doubts as to their
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   They proudly tick off what Fujimori has done for Porcon, a
prosperous village of 850 people tucked among pine forests high in
the Andes 360 miles northwest of Lima.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993 Fujimori's government has rebuilt Porcon's communal
center, assisted in soil conservation, installed a potable water
system and sewers, built volleyball courts, expanded the school,
constructed a health clinic and latrines and installed four
greenhouses for cultivating high-altitude potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmer Perez, 26, a member of Porcon's farming cooperative, said
Fujimori is like a native son.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, he said, has visited Porcon seven times, often just to
enjoy the bucolic peace of the countryside, and has spent the night
on several occasions. Perez said tourists are coming in increasing
numbers since Fujimori encouraged a Lima television station to do a
travel documentary on the area.
</P>
<P>
   Standing behind the counter in her shop, where she sells
knickknacks made from pine cones, Castrellon said:
</P>
<P>
   ''Many people are coming now and spending money in our shops. It
is all because of Fujimori.''

<HEADLINE> Drifter sentenced for school attack also charged with two others  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. (AP) -- A 24-year-old with a history of
psychological problems who is accused of sexual crimes at schools
in New York and New Jersey has been sentenced to 20 years in prison
for molesting a student at knifepoint.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Allen admitted Friday to attacking a 16-year-old boy in
the Millbrook Preparatory school Feb. 9. During the early morning
hours, he bound the victim with duct tape before molesting him.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have said Allen may have committed dozens -- perhaps
hundreds -- of similar crimes at boarding schools and sports camps
throughout the country over the past several years.
</P>
<P>
   As his 16-year-old victim watched in the Dutchess County
courtroom, Allen said he realized there was no way he could
apologize. ''I'm sure he just wants to forget about me,'' Allen
told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Allen added that no one could understand what he had endured
during his own childhood, but acknowledged that was no excuse.
</P>
<P>
   Police said two days after the Millbrook crime, Allen was
involved in a similar attack on another 16-year-old boy in a dorm
room at the Peddie School, a private boarding school in Hightstown,
N.J. He has been charged by Hightstown police with aggravated
sexual assault, aggravated sexual contact, robbery, theft, criminal
possession of a weapon, aggravated assault and four counts of
burglary.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Allen pleaded not guilty in Nassau County to charges
of sodomizing a 12-year-old boy staying in a dorm room at the C.W.
Post Campus of Long Island University for baseball camp.
</P>
<P>
   A report in Newsday in March said Allen was a homeless drifter
around the Long Island area.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's attorney, Assistant Public Defender Jennifer Burton,
said Allen was born Duc Thanh Nguyen during the Vietnam war, the
son of an American GI and a Vietnamese mother. Burton said he had
been abandoned and placed in an orphanage, where he was physically
and sexually abused. She said he suffered further abuse after he
came to the United States and was placed in foster homes.

<HEADLINE> Man sentenced to life in apartment fire death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOUNT HOLLY, N.J. (AP) -- A Willingboro man who stabbed and
suffocated his girlfriend, then set her apartment on fire was
sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Sentenced Friday for the June 1, 1998, death of Cynthia Rogers,
Anthony Calvin Tazewell will have to serve at least 35 years in
prison before he is eligible for parole.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Burlington County Prosecutor John Brennan said during
the trial that Tazewell's bloody fingerprint was found on a knife
and that the victim's blood was found on his clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers' body, which had not been burned during the fire, was
found partially clothed, with her bathrobe belt used to tie one
hand to a foot. An autopsy report indicated the 47-year-old woman
died of asphyxiation.
</P>
<P>
   Tazewell, 39, testified during the trial that Rogers had tried
to help him kick his drug habit, an effort her father said went
unrewarded.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cynthia was a good girl who was always trying to help
somebody,'' Joseph Rogers Sr. said Friday. ''Anthony Tazewell took
away a very special person from my family for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Tazewell's attorney suggested during the trial that he was so
high on drugs at the time of Rogers' death, he didn't know if he
had killed her.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Tazewell again maintained his innocence, saying ''I
don't believe I really did it.''

<HEADLINE> Israel Troops Leave Lebanon Outpost  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN SEVAREID
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHEBAA, Lebanon (AP) -- In a move likely to help defuse tension
in a disputed area, Israeli forces have pulled out of two outposts
at the Lebanese-Israeli frontier as U.N. teams prepared to finalize
the border between the nations, U.N. sources said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the border Saturday, U.N. peacekeepers deployed at
a fence where Lebanese have been throwing stones and firebombs at
Israeli soldiers on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   Ten blue-helmeted U.N. peacekeepers kept Lebanese about 25 yards
away from Israeli soldiers on the other side of the fence to
prevent friction. Israeli soldiers also kept people away from their
side of the barrier.
</P>
<P>
   After the peacekeepers left, however, some Lebanese civilians
tried to climb the fence into Israeli territory and Israeli
soldiers fired warning shots in the air, an army statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon on Wednesday,
civilians and armed guerrillas have been converging on the new
border. Some came out of curiosity to peek at Israel, which most
Lebanese have never seen, but others vented their anger, shouting
insults and throwing firebombs, stones, glass bottles and fruit at
Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   In the disputed Chebaa area, U.N. peacekeepers positioned more
than a half-mile across a valley from the three Israeli outposts
said two of the positions were abandoned Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, the army denied reports of troop activity in the
area. But town residents and U.N. peacekeepers at a nearby post
heard explosions. Lebanese security officials suspected -- but could
not confirm -- the detonations were to demolish the abandoned
positions.
</P>
<P>
   It was not yet clear whether the newly abandoned outposts are
part of the nearby disputed Chebaa farms. Israel captured the strip
of land from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war but Lebanon claims it as
its own, a position supported by Damascus. By evacuating the
outposts in the Chebaa area, Israel defuses an excuse for Hezbollah
guerrilla attacks from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah guerrilla leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah on Friday
urged Israel to withdraw from the Chebaa farms but did not say
whether Hezbollah would follow through on its threat to attack
Israel if the area was not returned.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. envoy Terje Roed-Larsen said in Beirut on Friday that the
United Nations considers the Chebaa farms Syrian, meaning Israel's
presence there would not impede a formal U.N. confirmation of the
Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail Sharifa, 43, a Chebaa native who owns land in town and on
the farms, came from Tripoli in northern Lebanon on Saturday for
the first time since 1981. He lost his land after Israeli troops
occupied the area.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a good life in Tripoli but once I get the land I want
to live here. It's one of the most beautiful places in the world,''
Sharifa said. He said his family used to grow peanuts, wheat,
barley, lentils, cucumbers and tomatoes on the land.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, people dropped by a few at a time at spots near
the border, congratulating each other on the end of the Israeli
occupation of southern Lebanon. An Israeli military jeep drove
slowly by on the other side of the fence, occasionally stopping.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. teams will be in the area in a few days to mark the
uncertain border line, after which the United Nations will work to
officially confirm complete Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon in
accordance with a 1978 Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. spokesman Timur Goskel said the teams, led by sappers
looking for mines, are checking the border line to make sure it
complies with maps prior to the first Israeli invasion of Lebanon
in 1978.

	   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. (AP) -- A 24-year-old with a history of

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeks Pakistan Aid on bin Laden  </HEADLINE>
By KATHY GANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- The United States is certain Pakistan
could persuade neighboring Afghanistan to hand over suspected
terrorist Osama bin Laden, a top U.S. diplomat said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Washington believes Pakistan's continued support for
Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia means it could play ''a very
constructive role in bringing Osama bin Laden to justice,'' said
U.S. Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering, speaking in
Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden is suspected of masterminding the twin U.S. Embassy
bombings in East Africa in 1998. Bin Laden, who is on the U.S. 10
Most Wanted List, is living in Afghanistan protected by the
Taliban, who have refused to hand him over for trial either in the
United States or a third country.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope in fact that we can encourage in every conceivable way
Pakistan to use all of its contacts and all of its relationships
with the Taliban to make it clear to the Taliban that the United
States considers the harboring of Osama bin Laden as something very
unfriendly to American interests,'' said Pickering.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan has repeatedly denied having influence enough with the
Taliban to force them to hand over bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan is one of only three countries to recognize the Taliban
and is considered to be the Taliban's strongest ally. Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates also recognize the Taliban government,
which seized the Afghan capital Kabul in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering is the first high-level U.S. visitor to Pakistan since
President Clinton made a five-hour visit in March. Clinton urged
Pakistan's military government to return to democracy, renew talks
with rival India and end support for militants fighting Indian
control in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering repeated Washington's call for Pakistan to end aid to
militants.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering also pressed Pakistan to sign the global test ban
treaty and warned that the possession of nuclear weapons by India
and Pakistan could result in a nuclear confrontation that would be
''catastrophic.''
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan says it wants a nationwide consensus before signing the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. India has expressed its willingness
to sign, but has not offered any date.

<HEADLINE> Peru's Fujimori Dodges Criticism  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- On the campaign trail for a third term,
Alberto Fujimori didn't blink when the rocks began flying last
week. Nor when the world community began hurling criticism.
</P>
<P>
   While addressing a crowd in Arequipa on Monday evening, the
61-year-old president kept right up with his stump speech even as
dozens of angry demonstrators let loose with stones, sticks and
tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fujimori! The people repudiate you!'' they shouted, the flying
debris bouncing harmlessly off the shields of riot police
protecting Fujimori in Peru's second city, 480 miles southeast of
Lima.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori kept right on talking, unflinching and unflappable
under the barrage of opposition to his plans to defy international
opinion and hold what many consider a flawed runoff election
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that his challenger Alejandro Toledo has cried fraud
and will boycott the vote. Or that the world community, led by the
United States, has threatened possible international isolation for
failing to delay the vote in order to assure a free and fair
election.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has stood up to big odds before.
</P>
<P>
   When he swept to a surprise victory in Peru's presidential
elections a decade ago, the former university rector took
iron-fisted control of a country many had written off as
ungovernable.
</P>
<P>
   Maoist guerrillas had driven the police and army units from wide
swaths of the countryside. Car bombs rocked the capital almost
daily. Annual inflation was running at more than 3,000 percent.
There were widespread shortages of basic foodstuffs like rice and
cooking oil.
</P>
<P>
   Few people gave Fujimori much chance of lasting more than six
months in power.
</P>
<P>
   Today the guerrillas have been reduced to a mere band of
marauders. Inflation last year was 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has installed a healthy free-market economy and cracked
down on cocaine trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   But he has done it all at a price -- with authoritarian measures
that have stifled opposition and raised serious doubts about the
fairness of Sunday's elections. A third, five-year term would defy
a constitutional prohibition on three straight terms in office.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori used the campaign to carry a message to the voters that
he is indispensable, that without him Peru will fall into chaos
again.
</P>
<P>
   ''Power fascinates me,'' he has said on more than one occasion
over the years.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the few revealing statements he has made about
himself.
</P>
<P>
   A workaholic loner, this son of poor Japanese immigrants said
once that the only institution he trusted was the National
Intelligence Service, the spy agency that helps him control Peru.
</P>
<P>
   The divorced father of four grown children, Fujimori is
described by associates as self-assured, calculating, pragmatic,
unsentimental, a man who lives for his work -- and whose work is
making Peru run smoothly.

<HEADLINE> APTN Cameraman Moreno de Mora Buried  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM BROWN
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIMBODI, Spain (AP) -- Associated Press Television News cameraman
Miguel Gil Moreno de Mora, shot in an ambush in Sierra Leone, was
buried Saturday in his small mountain village in eastern Spain.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 people -- family, friends and dozens of foreign
correspondents from throughout Africa, Europe, North America and
Asia -- gathered in the Vimbodi church to remember Gil Moreno de
Mora as a dedicated man who risked, and gave, his life to use his
camera as a voice for the world's most oppressed.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, Gil Moreno de Mora, who was killed Wednesday, has
reported for APTN in Chechnya, Bosnia, Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Congo
and other war zones, earning a reputation among colleagues
worldwide as a thoughtful, cool head and a steady hand in
life-threatening situations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Miguel achieved in five years what takes most people a
lifetime,'' said Nigel Baker, head of news for APTN, at the funeral
in Vimbodi, set amid olive groves and vineyards 70 miles north of
Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was spellbound by the way he spoke, the poetry of his
words.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker called Gil Moreno de Mora one of the most intelligent
cameramen of his generation and said he took extra care to
understand and film interview subjects. He died doing what he loved
most.
</P>
<P>
   ''After (Gil Moreno de Mora left) Kosovo, I asked him if he had
enough of war and human suffering. He said for the next few years,
this was the only job he wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The ambush that killed Gil Moreno de Mora also took the lives of
Washington native Kurt Schork, 53, a journalist for Reuters, and
four members of the Sierra Leone army.
</P>
<P>
   Two more Reuters journalists, South African cameraman Mark
Chisolm and Greek photographer Yannis Behrakis suffered slight
injuries in the same attack.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Moreno de Mora's body arrived via Paris, alongside the body
of Schork, in a coffin sealed with a ribbon in the colors of the
Spanish flag.
</P>
<P>
   ''They say that what made Miguel a great reporter is that he
understood war so well,'' said Tim Sullivan, AP bureau chief in
Abidjan, Ivory Coast, who was in Sierra Leone when Gil Moreno de
Mora was shot. ''But what made Miguel a great reporter is that he
knew people so well.''
</P>
<P>
   Gil Moreno de Mora started life as a journalist in 1993 when he
left his work as a lawyer in Barcelona and drove a motorcycle to
Bosnia in hopes of writing a book. His professionalism, despite
having never handled a camera or worked in news, rapidly earned him
the respect of the foreign correspondents there.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very obvious right away that he was a good guy,'' said
Tony Smith, a former AP correspondent in Sarajevo who worked with
Gil Moreno de Mora on his first television assignments. ''He
certainly had a sense of where the news was.''
</P>
<P>
   Gil Moreno de Mora was deeply upset in January 1999 when the
Revolutionary United Front -- the same rebel group suspected of
shooting him -- shot and killed his close friend, APTN cameraman
Myles Tierney in Freetown, Sierra Leone. Also seriously wounded in
that attack was Canadian Ian Stewart, AP's Abidjan bureau chief at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Myles understood people in pain,'' said Gil Moreno de Mora, in
words that would be repeated less than a year and a half later at
his own funeral. ''He cared for them because each was an individual
to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gil Moreno de Mora was the 25th AP journalist to die in the line
of duty since the organization was founded in 1848.
</P>
<P>
   As the coffin of Gil Moreno de Mora -- fabled for his mobility on
a motorbike in war-torn Bosnia -- was lowered into the crypt, the
roar of a nearby dirt bike echoed through the pine cemetery.
Correspondents looked at each other and smiled at the memory.

<HEADLINE> Canada Seeks E. coli Outbreak Source  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- An E. coli outbreak that killed five people and
sickened hundreds appeared to be abating Saturday, but the
finger-pointing increased with accusations that the water supply
had shown traces of bacteria for months.
</P>
<P>
   Freelton, a community about 60 miles from the small southern
Ontario town of Walkerton, came under a boil order for its water
Saturday after traces of E. coli turned up. No illness had been
reported and officials described the move as precautionary, saying
they have yet to determine the strain of E. coli detected.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials say more people in Walkerton, where one of the
worst incidents of E. coli contamination in North America began
last week, still could fall ill with cramps, diarrhea, vomiting and
fever symptomatic of the intestinal bacteria often spread through
animal or human feces.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people seeking treatment at the local health
center has decreased, and a doctor at a hospital in London,
Ontario, where the most critically ill children were taken, said he
thought all 12 would recover.
</P>
<P>
   At least one class-action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of
town residents, and three investigations were under way. Ontario
Provincial police were interviewing water utility workers and
gathering documents, while environment and health officials worked
to learn what caused the contamination. The coroner announced an
inquest.
</P>
<P>
   People in Walkerton attended the second funeral in two days,
gathering at Sacred Heart church to remember Edith Pearson, 83, a
mother of five with 13 grandchildren who had been preparing to
celebrate her 60th wedding anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   People in the farming town of 5,000 about 90 miles west of
Toronto first noticed the problem last week when residents began
getting sick. Investigators are focusing on why the local Public
Utility Commission failed to immediately notify health authorities
that water from town wells was contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor David Thomson of the Brockton municipality, which includes
Walkerton, said the utility's general manager has acknowledged the
commission was aware of the problem as early as May 18 but didn't
tell local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   A local health official issued a boil order for the water supply
on May 21 following reports from doctors of bloody diarrhea. The
health officer said he had asked the utility commission three times
if the water was clean, and was told it was.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kieffer, chairman of the utility commission, said utility
workers may have been unaware of how dangerous E. coli could be.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, an official of a private laboratory that tests water
said it detected traces of another bacteria in the Walkerton water
as far back as January. Garry Palmateer of GAP EnviroMicrobial
Services told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. there were
indications that surface water was entering the town wells.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was obvious that there was a contamination problem,'' as a
result of malfunctioning wells, Palmateer said.
</P>
<P>
   One possible cause of the E. coli contamination was the flooding
that followed a heavy storm May 12 that could have inundated the
water system with runoff containing farm animal feces.
</P>
<P>
   Walkerton utility manager Stan Koebel was unavailable for
comment. Thomson, the mayor, has said Koebel believed he could
solve the E. coli problem on his own by flushing the water system
and fixing a malfunctioning chlorinator on one of the two main
wells.
</P>
<P>
   The contamination caused officials to close all five schools in
the community, including the day care center.

<HEADLINE> Peru Economist Seeks Presidency  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- After a quarter-century of preparing himself
to lead Peru, Alejandro Toledo is putting his ambition on the line
to thwart what he says is a conspiracy to hand President Alberto
Fujimori a rigged, third-term victory.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to an electoral system plagued by irregularities,
Toledo says he will not participate in Sunday's scheduled vote, and
has asked his supporters to spoil their ballots with the words ''no
to fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   He says his party will continue campaigning ''against fraud and
seeking a new, reasonable date to allow the introduction of changes
for a clean election.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has accused Toledo of confusing voters and attempting
to destabilize Peru by boycotting the election while not officially
withdrawing from the race.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo is not alone in demanding a postponement. The
Organization of American States' election mission has said it
cannot endorse Sunday's vote because of flaws in the
ballot-counting system. And Transparencia, Peru's most important
election watchdog group, says the irregularities are so grave that
it will not bother observing the scheduled runoff.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department fully backs Transparencia and the OAS
mission. Washington has warned Fujimori that Peru could face
diplomatic and economic sanctions if election irregularities
persist.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president cannot deafen the ears of at least 50 percent of
the voting population, nor can he close the eyes of an
international community,'' Toledo told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Promising jobs and capitalizing on his Indian appearance, the
54-year-old candidate made a surprising surge in the first round
election, forcing Fujimori into a runoff vote that few had
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori characterizes Toledo as a populist who would plunge the
country back into the political chaos and hyperinflation of the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But he presents himself as a humble bricklayer's son who shined
shoes to help make ends meet and who went on to become a World Bank
consultant. He is on leave from his current post as a director of
ESAN, Peru's premier business school.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo has never held elected office. He received less than 4
percent support in 1995 when Fujimori won a landslide re-election
victory.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Ruling Party Chides Britain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- South Africa's ruling party
criticized Britain on Saturday for halting land reform payments to
Zimbabwe amid forced land seizures in the neighboring African
country.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's ruling African National Congress ''does not
accept any conditions put on funds by the British government,'' ANC
Secretary-General Kgalema Motlanthe said. He made his remarks after
ANC officials met with a delegation from the ruling Zimbabwe
African National Union-Patriotic Front party.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has refused to provide $57 million for land reform until
Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, halts the deadly violence that
erupted after armed black squatters began occupying white-owned
farms in February.
</P>
<P>
   ZANU-PF national chairman John Nkomo said if the British
government does not deliver funds to pay farmers for their land,
Zimbabwe will go ahead with its planned land takeovers. He said
parliamentary elections also will proceed as scheduled on June
24-25.
</P>
<P>
   The political violence in Zimbabwe has caused friction in the
ANC's ranks.
</P>
<P>
   In a motion read in South Africa's Parliament on Tuesday, the
ANC said violence and thuggery could compromise its neighbor's
upcoming parliamentary elections. But South African President Thabo
Mbeki, who was on a trip to the United States, disagreed, telling
reporters it was still too early to judge whether the outcome of
the poll would be flawed.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the motion, ANC parliamentary spokesman Pieter
Venter, then resigned from the party in disgust.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Seizes Eritrean City  </HEADLINE>
By CRAIG NELSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) -- Ethiopians forces drove deeper into
Eritrea on Saturday despite a new agreement for peace talks,
shelling a city just 50 miles from their adversary's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Civilians fled ahead of the Ethiopian move on the city of
Adikeyhe, joining what Eritrea says are hundreds of thousands of
others displaced by Ethiopia's 2-week-old offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses reported civilians streaming in single-file lines
along the two-lane asphalt road leading north of Adikeyhe. They
also described government troops hastily dismantling a
ground-to-air missile battery on the outskirts of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Government-commandeered trucks and buses also moved 20,000
displaced Eritreans to a schoolyard outside the town of Dibarwa, 22
miles south of the capital, said Yusef Feshaye, a local official
for the state-run relief agency. As night fell across the arid,
rocky landscape, women and children huddled around wood fires to
ease the cold.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south in Mandefera, Eritrean troops mingled among the
newly homeless and residents wondered whether they, too, should
flee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whenever we see someone running away, we assume the enemy is
coming. We're terrorized,'' said Mehari Gebrehiwet, a 39-year-old
English teacher.
</P>
<P>
   African diplomats announced Friday that Eritrea had agreed to
resume peace talks and to surrender two key towns demanded by its
Horn of Africa neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   But Ethiopia insisted again Saturday the offensive would stop
only when it was satisfied Eritrea had truly withdrawn from all
disputed land.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only the Ethiopian government will confirm Eritrea has pulled
out from all occupied territory,'' government spokesman Haile Kiros
Gessesse said at Makele, an air force base in northern Ethiopia.
''We trust only ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not believe this regime will really leave us alone
without any further aggression,'' Haile Kiros added.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the state interior ministry of Sudan -- Eritrea's
main border state besides Ethiopia -- said it fears as many as
250,000 Eritrean refugees could flock to Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan officially estimates that 35,000 Eritreans have poured
into the country since Ethiopia invaded Eritrea on May 12. The U.N.
High Commission for Refugees said Saturday it had registered 30,000
Eritrean refugees, but that only one-half of that number were
actually in the Sudanese refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   Many Eritreans are returning home in the hope that the war will
recede, said Paul Stromberg, a spokesman for the commission.
Others, he said, crossed into Sudan, received aid and then headed
back to tend to their livestock, which Sudanese law bans them from
importing.
</P>
<P>
   After invading Eritrea, Ethiopia said it would leave only after
it had broken the Eritrean army and retaken all territory seized by
Eritrea at the start of the 2-year-old border war.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia's military routed Eritrea's forces from their border
strongholds late in the week and has been chasing them north into
Eritrea ever since.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Ethiopia said it had taken Adikeyhe, which would
put its advance about 31 miles north of the border. But the
witnesses said late Saturday that Ethiopian infantry had not yet
seized the city.
</P>
<P>
   The Ethiopian pursuit, and the Eritrean retreat, have followed
the increasingly steep road leading to the Eritrean capital of
Asmara.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia, however, has never listed the Eritrean capital among
its objectives. Ethiopian officials have said repeatedly they will
return all undisputed Eritrean territory when their aims are met.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea agreed late Thursday to peace talks due to start Monday
in Algiers, under the auspices of the Organization of African
Unity.
</P>
<P>
   The country also promised to give up by Monday two eastern
towns, Bada and Bure, demanded by Ethiopia. While the towns were
indisputably Eritrean, the Asmara government said, Eritrea wanted
to deny Ethiopia all pretext for pressing the war.
</P>
<P>
   Haile Kiros, the Ethiopian government spokesman, said Saturday
that Eritrea continued to occupy Bada and Bure and scattered
villages along the central front.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea complained in a statement late Friday that Ethiopia has
never thoroughly specified which territory it considers illegally
occupied.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia and Eritrea, two of the world's poorest countries, have
spent hundreds of millions of dollars arming and manning for the
contest over their poorly delineated 600-mile border.

   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Riot police used batons and rubber
bullets Saturday to disperse Catalan separatists and pacifists
protesting Spain's annual Armed Forces Day celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Separatists carrying banners reading ''No King, No Army,
Resistance'' sought to get closer to Montjuic mountain, Barcelona's
highest point, where King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia were
surveying a parade of 1,800 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters are demanding independence for Catalonia, a
region in northeastern Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Police dispersed nearly 500 people using batons and rubber
bullets. The protesters answered back by throwing stones and
burning trash containers. Nine people, between ages 17 and 34, were
detained. Two people were slightly injured, the private news agency
EFE said.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the parade began, police cleared out hundreds of
people who were camping at the central Plaza de Espana to protest
the Barcelona military celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Armed Forces Day is normally held in the Spanish capital,
Madrid. This year, authorities decided to hold the celebration in

Wendy's Suspect Was a Fugitive

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A man captured in the execution slayings of five people at a
Wendy's was a fugitive free on $3,500 bail after a string of armed robberies at
fast-food restaurants, authorities said today. Prosecutors had requested a bail
of $100,000 for John ''Benji'' Taylor, but the judge released him last summer
''on a ridiculously low bail,'' said Sherry Hunter, a spokeswoman for the Queens
district attorney. The 36-year-old suspect and an alleged accomplice were to be
arraigned today for killing five Wendy's employees and wounding two others.
Their heads wrapped in plastic, they were bound, gagged and shot execution-style
in the Flushing section of the borough on Wednesday.

deployed at a fence where Lebanese have been throwing stones and firebombs at
Israeli soldiers on the other side. Ten blue-helmeted U.N. peacekeepers kept
Lebanese about 25 yards away from Israeli soldiers on the other side of the

   These and other mixed doses of optimism and gloom highlight the
latest conclusions of trend-watching environmental monitors taking
the millennial pulse of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   In its annual compendium of food, agricultural, energy,
atmospheric, economic, transportation, communications, social and
military trends, the Worldwatch Institute concludes that fault
lines are growing between North and South, within nations and
between men and women.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on an array of global data, researchers conclude that 45
percent of the world's income went to the 12 percent of the world's
people who live in rich industrial nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The longer the richer nations go on their material-intensive
path of consumption, the harder it gets for countries like India,
China and others to have any hope of giving their own people a
decent life,'' said Michael Renner, co-author of the ''Vital
Signs'' report for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The independently financed environmental research organization
has issued the overviews annually since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The latest report also charts the ''digital divide'' in
rich-poor usage of computer technology.
</P>
<P>
   ''In America, we worry that less than 40 percent of the
population uses the Internet regularly, but it's even more striking
at the global level, with only 4 percent of the world population
online,'' said Molly O. Sheehan, another co-author. Africa is
essentially off-line, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   This has strong environmental implications for those left out,
Sheehan said in an interview. The Internet can reduce energy and
materials used, help link environmental and social activists and
spread global understanding of the earth's fragile state, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The report cites surveys of women in power and says they have
made slow but significant progress since World War II. Women hold
13.2 percent of the seats in popularly elected national
legislatures, up from 3 percent in 1945, it found.
</P>
<P>
   International tourism, according to the World Tourism
Organization, reached a record 657 million arrivals worldwide last
year, a 3 percent increase in a year.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwatch says the wind turbine industry, up 39 percent in
megawatts produced last year, is growing faster than the personal
computer industry and almost as fast as the cellular phone market.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial organic farming, the report says, has spread to at
least 130 countries, from just three in the 1970s. Growth of the
practice, which rejects synthetic pesticides and artificial
fertilizers, stands at 30 percent a year in Europe, the report
says.
</P>
<P>
   In a first look at global prison populations, the report says
just three countries held more than half the world's 8 million
inmates last year.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had 1.7 million, China 1.4 million and Russia
1 million. On a per capita basis, Russia leads with 687 prisoners
for every 100,000 population. The United States has 645. Based on a
British report, the global average is 137 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Japan had the lowest rate of any nation: 39 per 100,000.

<HEADLINE> Aussie PM Urged on Aborigine Apology  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE CORDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Protesters turned their backs on Prime
Minister John Howard and yelled ''Say sorry!'' Saturday as he spoke
at an event aimed at promoting reconciliation between Australia's
whites and Aborigines.
</P>
<P>
   Angry over Howard's refusal to apologize to Australia's
indigenous community, dozens of people in the mostly white audience
of about 2,000 stood and showed him their backs. The move came
during his speech at the Corroboree 2000 event at the Sydney Opera
House.
</P>
<P>
   Corroboree 2000, which took its name for an Aboriginal word for
ceremony, was called so that indigenous Australians could present
the nation with a ''Declaration Towards Reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   The declaration, which carries no legal weight, was drawn up by
a committee that worked for 10 years and held more than 200 public
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   It calls for a recognition of Aboriginal culture and history and
of their mistreatment by a succession of governments since white
settlers arrived in 1788. It also asks for white Australia to
apologize and for Aborigines in return to forgive as a way of
building a ''united Australia that respects this land of ours ...
and provides justice and equity for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Aborigines now number 386,000 in a population of 19 million.
They are the poorest, worst educated, sickest and most likely to be
jailed members of society.
</P>
<P>
   Aborigines have long demanded a formal government apology for
their past mistreatment, particularly for an enforced assimilation
policy that involved removing Aboriginal children from their
parents and placing them in white families or children's' homes.
The practice was halted in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Howard has refused, saying he won't apologize for policies of
past governments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Say sorry to the indigenous people, you fool,'' one protester
screamed as Howard spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Another, just yards from Howard and other Australian federal and
state leaders, unfurled a banner proclaiming ''No reconciliation
without justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing his speech despite being all but drowned out by the
shouting protesters, Howard urged all Australians to look
positively at the reconciliation process.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let us all ... focus on those things that unite us and bind us
together as Australians in the cause of healing the wounds and
divisions of the past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many senior Aboriginal leaders boycotted the event to protest at
Howard's refusal to apologize. Geoff Clark, chairman of the
Aboriginal and Torres Straits Islander Commission, the nation's
most senior indigenous group, did attend.
</P>
<P>
   Clark used the stage to call on the government to negotiate a
formal treaty with Aborigines setting up legal processes for
dealing with issues like land rights and compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ''A commitment from the government to negotiate a treaty is
essential,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, 100,000 people are expected to walk across Sydney
Harbor Bridge to show their support for reconciliation.

<HEADLINE> School surveys raise questions about student privacy  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY PARELLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The surveys are spread through schools,
seeking answers that some say allow schools, parents and community
groups to give young people the help they need to resist drugs,
alcohol and sex.
</P>
<P>
   They have become a common way to get a snapshot of the lives of
teens. And they probe sensitive, private issues, like sex, drugs
and families.
</P>
<P>
   Some say these surveys are the only way to get information to
steer programs, curriculum and other efforts to combat the
pressures that teens face today.
</P>
<P>
   Others say the questionnaires are an invasion of privacy, a
violation of students' civil rights and simply a way to funnel more
government money into community programs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some lawmakers say parents must give permission for schools
to query students about sensitive subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly Education Committee last week passed a bill,
A-2351, that would require districts to get parents' written
permission for any questionnaire that asks about political
affiliations, mental problems, sexual behavior and attitudes,
illegal behavior and certain information about family members,
among other topics.
</P>
<P>
   The bill stems from a controversy in the Ridgewood School
District, where parents are suing the district over a 156-question
survey administered to about 2,000 middle- and high-school students
last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were asking kids highly personal questions about their
sexual behaviors, questions about illegal and criminal activity,
antisocial behavior,'' said Carol Nunn, one of several Ridgewood
parents involved in a lawsuit against the school district over the
survey.
</P>
<P>
   ''Students were asked questions that alleged criminals don't
have to answer without an attorney present,'' she added. ''And the
school district did not seek or obtain written parental consent.''
</P>
<P>
   Nunn says these types of surveys serve no other purpose than to
allow non-profits to grab more government money for their programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is a scam to get money, and at worst it is
voyeurism,'' she said. ''We don't want our children taking surveys
like this. It is nobody's business.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal lawsuit, which was filed by the Rutherford Institute
on behalf of three parents, seeks to have the results of the survey
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   But Frederick Stokley, Ridgewood superintendent, said his
district was simply trying to determine whether the community was
giving young people the support they need.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to assess and do a diagnosis on how well we were
serving youth in our community,'' Stokley said. ''That was the
purpose behind the survey.''
</P>
<P>
   The creators of the test used in Ridgewood say results can help
schools and communities figure out how to help kids.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are searching for ways in which they can reach out to
the youth in their communities and help them thrive,'' said Jean
Wachs, research manager at Search Institute, a Minneapolis-based
organization that has administered the test used in Ridgewood to
more than 1 million students in the United States. ''That's at the
very heart of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most agree parents should be involved in the process of learning
about the condition of today's youth.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to work with the parents and the families,'' said
Barbara Bole Williams, a school psychologist in Audubon. ''It's
critical that everyone is working together for a common goal,
because those are the kids that are successful.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Williams added, mandating parental permission presents some
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Districts often use surveys to measure whether a program is
effective -- and whether it should continue to receive funding. If
too many parents fail to provide permission, the results of that
research tends to be skewed.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, a minority of parents oppose a survey, said Wachs. The
problem is, in schools where ''active'' permission is required,
parents sometimes fail to return the permission slips, even if they
have no objections to the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Most districts currently rely on ''passive permission,'' Wachs
said, meaning they notify parents about the survey and those who
object can have their children excused from taking it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only concern we have is it would lessen the sample and
restrict the validity,'' Stokley said. ''You would immediately
filter out a certain number of students.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Hancock, director for the state office of educational
support services, said the state administers several surveys in
schools to discover whether certain programs are working and what
else is needed.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Education has not yet taken a position
on the bill, she added, but currently encourages districts to use
''passive consent.''
</P>
<P>
   Wachs said as more districts use these surveys -- and parents get
used to them -- the participation problem could ''be overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think (parental permission) is becoming more of an issue,''
she added. ''I think parents deserve to know when surveys are being
administered that are not specifically related to a student's
school work.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see it as a very positive step,'' she added. ''These parents
are really connecting with what their kids are doing.''

<HEADLINE> Bomb Suspect Moved to Pensacola  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- A federal judge has moved the trial of
a white man accused of setting off two pipe bombs at predominantly
black Florida A&AMP;M University to Pensacola due to pretrial
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the bombing charges, Lawrence Lombardi, 42, is charged
with committing a hate crime for allegedly setting off the bombs at
the university's Tallahassee campus.
</P>
<P>
   Neither blast did much damage and no one was injured, but last
year's explosions -- and the racist threats that followed each -- set
the entire campus on edge.
</P>
<P>
   Lombardi for a while worked for a local distributing company
stocking vending machines on the FAMU campus and elsewhere around
Tallahassee. He also is charged with two counts of possession of a
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   His trial is set to begin June 19 before U.S. District Judge
Robert Hinkle, and is expected to last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   During a court hearing Friday, Hinkle ruled against Lombardi's
request to move the trial out of North Florida. He decided instead
on Pensacola, located about 190 miles west of Tallahassee, but
still within the same federal judicial district.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted on all charges, Lombardi could face up to life in
prison, and fines as high as $250,000.

<HEADLINE> Artist Ted Drake Dies at 92  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELKHART, Ind. (AP) -- Ted Drake, the artist and illustrator who
created Notre Dame's trademark leprechaun logo, has died at age 92.
</P>
<P>
   Drake died Thursday evening after suffering a stroke two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   His best known creations were Notre Dame's bearded leprechaun
and the symbol of the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Drake's career began during World War II, when he drew cartoons
for a Navy newspaper. After the war, he returned to Elkhart and
worked as a designer at Wilson Sporting Goods in Chicago. That was
where he created the Notre Dame logo in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Drake earned a mere $50 for the logo, which was later
copyrighted by the university. In 1993, Notre Dame's national
alumni board paid a special tribute to the artist.

<HEADLINE> Shrine Causes Problems for Japan FM  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- In another potential setback for Japan's ruling
party, media reported Saturday that Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa paid respects at a controversial war memorial while he was
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Miyazawa secretly visited Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine where Japan's
war dead including several convicted World War II criminals are
enshrined, the Tokyo Shimbun newspaper said. The report said the
visit took place in 1992 or 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Official visits to the shrine typically draw criticism from
other Asian countries, which have painful memories of Japanese
military aggression during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls to Miyazawa's office went unanswered Saturday.
Yasukuni Shrine official Akio Saka refused to confirm the reports.
</P>
<P>
   The reports may prove embarrassing for his Liberal Democratic
Party, already struggling to stem a decline in support ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, also of the LDP, apologized Friday
for calling Japan a ''divine nation,'' a comment which drew wide
criticism as it reminded many of the emperor-worship that fueled
the country's invasion of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Mori, who faces a general election in June, said he regretted
causing misunderstanding by his comments and insisted that he did
not mean he supported the wartime imperial system.
</P>
<P>
   Miyazawa's visit to the shrine was the fulfilment of a campaign
promise he made to the Japan War-Bereaved Association, Kyodo News
agency reported. Miyazawa served as prime minister from 1991 to
1993.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid offending China, Miyazawa waited until after Emperor
Akihito made his first visit to China in October 1992, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
   Former leader Ryutaro Hashimoto was the last prime minister to
visit the shrine in an official capacity in 1996.

   KAIBAB NATIONAL FOREST, Ariz. (AP) -- A lightning-caused wildfire
continued to tear through the Kaibab National Forest Saturday while
firefighters could do little to slow its advance.
</P>
<P>
   About 600 people were battling the fire about 20 miles northeast
of Williams. It has now burned more than 4,100 acres and
firefighters have been able to cut lines around only 5 percent of
the blaze. Three air tankers dropping red fire retardant and four
helicopters making water drops were assisting the ground battle.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the fire has remained in wilderness areas, but residents
in Williams and Parks awoke to a haze of thick smoke lingering in
their towns Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no threat those communities,'' forest spokeswoman
Irma Matson said.
</P>
<P>
   A temporary closure is in effect for areas of the Kaibab and
Coconino national forests surrounding Kendrick Peak.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Supports Angolan Military  </HEADLINE>
By CASIMIRO SIONA
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUANDA, Angola (AP) -- The top United States' official for Africa
expressed support on Saturday for Angola's military efforts to end
a protracted civil war against the UNITA rebels.
</P>
<P>
   But Susan Rice, assistant U.S. secretary of state for African
affairs, also said negotiations between the government and UNITA
appeared unlikely at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The fastest way to end the conflict, she said, would be for
UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi to abide by a 1994 peace deal, end
military actions and disarm. ''But, since he won't do that, the
military response is a necessary part of the government's efforts
for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 Lusaka protocol, brokered by the United Nations,
unraveled in 1998 as full-scale war flared anew amid lingering
hostilities and breaches of the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has pledged $3 million to help fund a
three-year AIDS program in Angola and an annual contribution of $38
million for humanitarian operations, Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. official also fired some criticism at the
government, saying the country needs democratic and economic
reform, an end to corruption and more press freedom.
</P>
<P>
   This government has ruled Angola for the past 25 years with an
iron grip, curbing public dissent and clamping down on independent
media.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups also have accused President Jose Eduardo Dos
Santos and his inner circle of personally benefiting from the
government's oil exploration deals with foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
   The government and UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola, began fighting after
Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Rebels Begin Cease-Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger rebels began a
12-hour cease-fire Saturday to allow civilians trapped in battle
zones in the northern Jaffna peninsula to escape to safety, sources
close to the rebels said.
</P>
<P>
   But a Defense Ministry spokesman said he was unaware that
fighting had been halted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no intimation from anyone. No one has told us
anything,'' Brig. Palitha Fernando said from the capital, Colombo.
''We feel this is either a publicity gimmick or the terrorists are
trying to buy time so that they can regroup.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Friday night from their London office, the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam said they would observe the
cease-fire until 10 p.m. on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the rebels, who spoke on condition their names
not be used, said the Tamil Tigers were honoring the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels said in their statement that they also approached the
International Committee of the Red Cross and other human rights
organizations near Jaffna to help to evacuate civilians to safe
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Harsha Gunawardene, spokesman for the ICRC in Sri Lanka,
declined to comment on whether the organization had been contacted
by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an officer with the anti-terrorist Special Task Force
was killed and four others were wounded Saturday in a mine blast in
Vavuniya, a northern, government-held town, civilian witnesses and
a Vavuniya police officer said.

<HEADLINE> High speed train won't be speeding through Connecticut  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Amtrak's new high-speed trains, designed
to go 100 mph, won't be traveling nearly that fast through
southwest Connecticut, the railroad has announced.
</P>
<P>
   The high volume of train traffic between New York and New Haven
and an outmoded New Haven train station -- where the tracks are
close together -- will prohibit high speeds and the use of the
''tilt technology'' on Acela trains, Amtrak and state
transportation officials said this week. The tilting mechanism is
designed to keep the train stable through turns at high speeds.
</P>
<P>
   The trains will accelerate to only 75 mph between New Haven and
New York, Kim Dunn, an Amtrak spokeswoman said. That is the lowest
speed the train will travel on its trek through the Northeast
Corridor, and is not fast enough to warrant use of the tilt, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   How to safely use the tilting mechanism in the New Haven-New
York area ''was the No. 1 concern'' while readying the trains for
operation, said Jim Turngren, Amtrak's assistant general manager in
New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Among the concerns were that a tilting train could collide with
a platform or electrical pole in New Haven and that a
malfunctioning train could tilt too closely to another train on the
four-track railroad, Turngren said.
</P>
<P>
   Turning off the tilting mechanism ''will certainly be a
safeguard,'' Turngren said. ''We've discussed it with Metro-North
and we're certainly comfortable that all the safety precautions
have been taken.''
</P>
<P>
   No other portion of the Boston-to-Washington corridor has tilt
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak hopes to make up for the time lost between New Haven and
New York elsewhere along the route in order to maintain its
schedule projections. It projects the New York-to-Boston trip will
take three hours; the Washington-to-New York leg two hours and 45
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers are still working out the degree to which the trains
will be able to safely tilt as they travel between Boston and
Washington, said Grady Cothen, deputy associate administrator for
safety standards with the Federal Railroad Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our original target was for more than 6 degrees of tilt,''
Cothen said. ''But there are a whole range of factors that will be
taken into consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Many curves along the New Haven-to-New York railroad, too, will
hold Acela Express trains to their lowest speeds, officials said.
The trains will be capable of only half their speed capabilities in
that area. Eventually, the trains might hit speeds of 90 mph, Dunn
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're never going to be talking 100 mph from New Haven to New
York in our lifetime,'' said Harry P. Harris, chief of the public
transportation bureau for the state Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak is planning to introduce Acela Express trains in late
July -- six months behind schedule.

<HEADLINE> TV Debate Helps Mexican Candidate  </HEADLINE>
By JULIE WATSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A televised debate among Mexico's
presidential contenders appears to have helped repair the image of
a conservative opposition candidate who initially refused to take
part in the event.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers and analysts said Saturday that Vicente Fox, a brash
candidate representing the National Action Party, may have regained
lost ground in Friday night's crucial debate.
</P>
<P>
   And while no clear winner emerged, some observers said the
ruling party nominee, Francisco Labastida, did not advance his
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Labastida was the big loser,'' the Mexico City newspaper
Universal quoted former Attorney General and Fox supporter Ignacio
Morales Lechuga as saying. ''Fox was the best and proved to be
knowledgeable with pluralistic proposals and projects.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who has the best chance in seven decades to unseat the
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party in the July 2 presidential
election, had his image tarnished by an earlier controversy over
the three-way debate.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing Labastida and left-center rival Cuauhtemoc Cardenas
would gang up on him, Fox had stalled on agreeing to conditions for
Friday's debate. Then, on television Tuesday, he suddenly reversed
course and demanded a debate that same day, over the objections of
his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Since the controversy, the ruling PRI has been broadcasting ads
asserting that Fox is unfit to be president. National media
lambasted him as childish.
</P>
<P>
   Fox used Friday's debate to divert the attacks with humor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some think that I was a little stubborn. Even my mother told
me that,'' he said with a grin -- one of the few the largely
sober-faced candidates managed during the first part of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ''But you need firm character and true leadership to end 70
years of corruption, poverty and desperation,'' Fox said, referring
to the PRI, which has governed Mexico since 1929.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's reluctance to agree to debate terms was seen as an attempt
to preserve the momentum he gained after a strong showing in the
first televised debate in April. Fox pulled roughly even with
Labastida in polls after that debate.
</P>
<P>
   By some accounts, Cardenas triumphed in Friday's debate. He has
climbed steadily in the polls in recent weeks from 10 percent to 19
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cardenas' campaign can no longer be considered dead,'' said
Lorenzo Meyer, a historian at the Colegio de Mexico. ''He showed
that there are still three contenders in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas blasted an often grim-faced Labastida throughout the
debate, quoting a 1992 speech in which Labastida had gushed praise
for then-President Carlos Salinas de Gortari -- Mexico's most
despised political figure. His term ended in 1994, when Mexico's
economy collapsed.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged in Pianist's Murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOMPSON, N.Y. (AP) -- A man who was on parole for burglary has
been charged in the 1998 murder of a pianist who appeared in the
movie ''The Godfather.''
</P>
<P>
   Angelo Barbaria's remains were found last year near this
Catskill Mountains village. The pianist had lived in the region and
worked at resorts there for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Samuel Van Dunk, 23, was charged with second-degree
murder, accused of smashing the 67-year-old's skull with a rock.
</P>
<P>
   Barbaria's sister, Gloria Fecher of New York, said she was told
Barbaria had met Van Dunk and his girlfriend at a laundromat.
</P>
<P>
   ''My brother recognized him walking down the road and gave him a
lift. They must've gotten into a terrible argument,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Police would not discuss a possible motive.
</P>
<P>
   Van Dunk was on parole for burglary at the time of the murder,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after Barbaria disappeared, his car turned up at a
car dealership. It was identified by the vanity plate -- 88AB, for
the number of keys on a piano and his initials. Police said
fingerprints on the inside of a passenger window matched Van
Dunk's.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ELKHART, Ind. (AP) -- Ted Drake, the artist and illustrator who
created Notre Dame's trademark leprechaun logo, died Thursday, two
weeks after suffering a stroke. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Drake's best known creations were Notre Dame's bearded
leprechaun and the symbol of the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Drake's career began during World War II, when he drew cartoons
for a Navy newspaper. After the war, he returned to Elkhart and
worked as a designer at Wilson Sporting Goods in Chicago. That was
where he created the Notre Dame logo in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Drake earned a mere $50 for the logo, which was later
copyrighted by the university. In 1993, Notre Dame's national
alumni board paid a special tribute to the artist.
Seymour S. Kety
</P>
<P>
   WESTWOOD, Mass. (AP) -- Dr. Seymour S. Kety, a biological
psychiatrist whose studies of the human brain revolutionized the
understanding of major mental illnesses, died Thursday. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Kety emphasized the biological bases of mental illness at a
time, during the 1950s, when psychoanalysis dominated most academic
psychiatry departments. His work was the first to provide evidence
that schizophrenia ran in families, helping to overturn the belief
that it was caused by bad parenting.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s and early '50s, Kety discovered the first
quantitative technique for measuring blood flow in the living
brain, a technique that made possible later technologies like PET
scanning.
</P>
<P>
   Kety was an emeritus professor of neuroscience at the Harvard
Medical School, having retired in 1983 after 15 years. Until 1997
he was senior psychobiologist at McLean Hospital in Belmont.
Robert Popp
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Robert Allyn Popp, the former longtime San
Francisco Chronicle police reporter who once helped tackle a
fleeing murder suspect, died Thursday in an auto accident. He was
74.
</P>
<P>
   Popp, who retired nine years ago, covered many of the city's
prominent murder cases, including the 1978 assassination of Mayor
George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk by Dan White, and the
Zebra killers case in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, a man accused of a double murder tried to
escape from a courtroom and Popp recalled he ''grabbed him by the
coattails and an assistant D.A. jumped on top of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Popp, who was born in Westfield, Mass., was hired by the
Chronicle in 1947 as a copy boy, but was quickly promoted to a
general assignment reporter in Oakland. Popp later worked out of
the San Mateo and San Francisco offices.
</P>
<P>
   Popp's car was struck by an oncoming car in Atherton on Thursday
afternoon. The accident remains under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, a brother, two sisters, a niece and
four nephews.
Maurice Richard
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Maurice ''The Rocket'' Richard, one of the
greatest scorers in National Hockey League history, died Saturday.
He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   The former Montreal Canadiens star, who slipped into a deep coma
overnight, died of abdominal cancer, family friend Jean Roy said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard was hospitalized with a recurrence of the cancer that
was first diagnosed more than two years ago. He also had
Parkinson's disease, and Roy said doctors also suspected the onset
of Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Richard, No. 62 on The Associated Press list of the top 100
athletes of the 20th century, was the cornerstone of the Canadiens'
dynasty that won five straight Stanley Cups and eight in his 18
seasons in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed the Rocket for his explosive speed and shot, Richard
finished his career with a then-record 544 goals. He was the first
player to score 500 goals and the first to score 50 goals in a
season when he did it in 50 games in 1944-45. His six overtime
goals remains a playoff record.
</P>
<P>
   Richard was a compelling figure on the ice. He was ambidextrous,
a right wing who shot left-handed. He often switched from backhand
to forehand as he swooped in on goalies. In the days before curved
blades and slap shots, the Rocket possessed a hard, accurate shot
and he was one of hockey's most dangerous scorers.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Peter Vermes and Miklos Molnar scored
second-half goals as the Kansas City Wizards beat Tampa Bay 2-1 on
Saturday to remain Major League Soccer's only undefeated team.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City's Tony Meola had his MLS-record scoreless streak
stopped at 681 minutes when Mamadou Diallo scored in the 66th
minute. Still the goalkeeper robbed the Tampa Bay forward two other
times as the Wizards improved to 10-0-2.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-game unbeaten streak is tied for the second longest in
league history. Los Angeles had a 15-game streak in 1998 and a
12-game run in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Vermes opened the scoring in the 63rd minute. Molnar's eighth
goal -- coming on a bicycle kick -- made it 2-0 a minute later.
</P>
<P>
   After Diallo's goal in the 66th minute, a scrum broke out in
front of -- and partly in -- the Kansas City goal. Diallo, who
received a yellow card, and Meola tussled briefly before order was
restored.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo, who has seven goals in the past four games, was stopped
on a point-blank chance by Meola 25 minutes into the game and sent
a penalty kick wide right during first half injury time.
</P>
<P>
   The Mutiny (6-6) had their six-game home winning streak snapped.

<HEADLINE> Tornadoes Cause Ark. Damage  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Thunderstorms and tornadoes damaged
homes and downed trees and power lines in northern Arkansas
Saturday, injuring at least one person.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, tens of thousands remained without
electricity following storms Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas State Police said a tornado touched down near
Leachville, in the northeast corner of Arkansas. At least one
person was injured, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy rain also prompted flood warnings and stranded several
campers, canoeists and kayakers along the rapidly-flowing Buffalo
National River. National Park Service employees rescued one kayaker
from a tree at Ponca.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had lots of people who have been stranded for short periods
of time,'' said Searcy County Sheriff George Sutterfield.
</P>
<P>
   A lightning strike broke a water main in rural Johnson County,
resulting in a warning not to drink the water. The water system
serves less than 500 customers.
</P>
<P>
   High winds felled about 100 trees, overturned several trailers
and damaged other buildings near Southside in Independence County.
No injuries were reported there.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, two people died in the aftermath of storms
Thursday. One man fell from a ladder in Elon College Thursday and
died from his injuries. Another man in Burlington was killed Friday
by a tree limb while he was cutting trees knocked down by the
storms.
</P>
<P>
   Duke Power Co. said 40,000 of its customers remained without
power Saturday afternoon, with most of the outages in Greensboro
and Burlington, which received the brunt of the storm. Power wasn't
expected to be restored for most people until Sunday night.

<HEADLINE> Gore Sees Portent in Cadet Hat Toss  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST POINT, N.Y. (AP) -- Perhaps it was the luck of the toss?
</P>
<P>
   In a first for the United States Military Academy, one of the
white hats that Army cadets traditionally fling into the air after
commencement landed on the speakers' podium and, ''like a ringer in
horse shoes,'' got stuck on the microphone, Vice President Al Gore
made a point of telling reporters Saturday after he addressed the
Class of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Cadets' names are inside the hats and this particular topper
belonged to a Robert C. Stanton Jr., who happened to be leader of
the 940-plus-member graduating class.
</P>
<P>
   ''Isn't that interesting?'' Gore said. ''I think for him, if I
were a member of his family I would say, well, that's a sign that
he's destined for great things.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I just think that's so much of a coincidence,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Gore didn't keep the lucky hat, however. It went to the head of
his Secret Service detail, who was sitting on the speakers' stage
at the time.

<HEADLINE> Blazers Confident on Lakers Series  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The Portland Trail Blazers tried to keep
their spirits high Saturday by insisting that they didn't lose Game
3, but simply handed it over to the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Down 2-1 in the best-of-seven Western Conference finals, the
Blazers refuse to acknowledge that they're in trouble against the
Lakers. And they don't plan to make many changes for Game 4 on
Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to put any pressure on ourselves,'' said
Scottie Pippen. ''We're not going into this next game thinking that
our backs are to the wall. We just have to go out and outplay this
team, which I felt we've done this whole series but just haven't
capitalized.''
</P>
<P>
   The momentum has shifted wildly in this series. Following a
15-point defeat in Game 1, the Blazers blew out the Lakers by 29 on
Monday night. After a four-day layoff, Portland resumed its
intensity and took a 55-45 halftime lead Friday night before the
Lakers rallied.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers turned the ball over six times in the third quarter,
and Los Angeles went on a 20-6 run to take control. Shaquille
O'Neal, who outscored Blazers center Arvydas Sabonis 13-0 in the
period, was intentionally fouled with 16.9 seconds left and made
both free throws to give the Lakers a 72-71 lead. They didn't trail
again.
</P>
<P>
   Portland had a chance to tie at the end, but Kobe Bryant blocked
Sabonis' finger-roll attempt in the lane to preserve the 93-91
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd rather be blown out than lose by two points,'' Portland's
Rasheed Wallace said. ''We'll be all right. We've just got to cut
down on our turnovers, and we'll be cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's loss was the Blazers' first in six home playoff
games, and they fully expect to return to Staples Center for Game 5
tied again.
</P>
<P>
   ''The longer the series goes, the better our chances are going
to be because we feel like we do the things that are necessary to
give this team a hard time and to beat them,'' backup point guard
Greg Anthony said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, having achieved their goal of earning at least a
split at the Rose Garden, expect a relentless effort from the
Blazers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're going to be upset,'' O'Neal said. ''They're going to
be pumped up, and they're probably going to play an excellent ball
game. But I think if we can play an excellent ball game also, we'll
be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want to give them anything,'' Bryant said. ''We're
going to come out and try to take it from them and play like our
season's on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers might be forced to have Pippen relinquish some of
his duties double-teaming O'Neal and focus more on defending
Bryant, who repeatedly made jumpers over the smaller Damon
Stoudamire.
</P>
<P>
   Portland also can't count on Bryant getting five fouls, which
limited him on defense and allowed the Blazers to further exploit a
size advantage by posting up bigger guards on him.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I'm not in foul trouble, they're not going to be able to do
that,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the officiating, Bryant said: ''Some of the calls that I get,
with all the physical play that's going on, it's kind of tough.
Apparently they don't know I'm first-team all-defense yet.''

Alleged Teacher Killer Ordered Held

<P>
   LAKE WORTH, Fla. (AP) -- A Florida grand jury will consider what charges will
be brought against a 13-year-old accused of fatally shooting a middle school
teacher. With his visibly distraught parents looking on, Palm Beach County
Circuit Court Judge Jorge LaBarga ordered the boy to remain in custody. The
youngster had been sent home by an assistant principal yesterday for throwing
water balloons in class. He returned with a compact, 5-inch gun loaded with four
bullets he had stolen from his grandfather's dresser drawer a week before.
Police say they are also considering filing charges against the grandfather.

the new threat was discovered Friday looking for a job. The virus -- called
''Killer Resume'' -- is spread through e-mail systems using the Microsoft

investigation. The virus could spread as businesses open overseas on Monday and

Russia making cuts. The Texas governor paired the cuts with a broad national
security review that must include a missile defense system. He also opposes a

''a very constructive role in bringing Osama bin Laden to justice,'' said U.S.
Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering, speaking in Islamabad. Bin Laden is
suspected of masterminding the twin U.S. Embassy bombings in East Africa in
1998. Bin Laden, who is on the U.S. 10 Most Wanted List, is living in
Afghanistan protected by the Taliban.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Despite losing another big man to an injury, the New York
Knicks received inspired performances from Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston to
beat the Indiana Pacers 98-95 today in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals.
Sprewell broke out of a series-long slump and scored 32 points and Houston won
his matchup with Reggie Miller and scored 28 as the Knicks cut the Pacers' lead
to 2-1 in the best-of-seven series. Game 4 is Monday. It was another chapter of
adversity overcome for a Knicks team that always seems to play its best when
things look their worst. If the sight of forward Patrick Ewing sitting on the
bench wasn't bad enough, it looked even worse when Marcus Camby slipped and
injured his knee.

<HEADLINE> Increased Oil Outputs Touted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CUERNAVACA, Mexico (AP) -- U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson
reiterated a call for oil-producing countries to consider
increasing crude outputs in the third quarter in order to drop gas
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson was in Mexico to attend a fund-raising event for a
children's hospital run by his sister in this city 35 miles south
of Mexico City, but he used the opportunity to press for increased
oil outputs to reduce the wild swings in world energy markets.
Mexico's Energy Secretary Luis Tellez also attended the event.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson has repeatedly voiced concerns about crude prices,
which are currently hovering around $30 per barrel, a price he has
said is too high for U.S. consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, along with Saudi Arabia and Venezuela -- members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries -- played a leading
role in curbing oil production that led crude prices to recover
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The three recently issued a statement saying they were satisfied
with the April output increases made by OPEC and non-OPEC
producers, and believe no further actions were needed at this time.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC ministers are scheduled to meet in Vienna in late June to
discuss what further output measures, if any, they will take.
</P>
<P>
   Tellez has said Mexico will increase its exports if OPEC decides
to increase output.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month at a two-day conference of Pacific Rim energy
ministers in San Diego, Richardson said he would continue with
diplomatic efforts like those he said contributed to producers'
decisions to raise output in April.
</P>
<P>
   ''The quiet diplomacy worked. I will be in touch with OPEC
ministers and will not rule out travel. ... This is an important
issue to American consumers,'' Richardson said.

<HEADLINE> Cubs 3, Giants 2, 11 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Jose Nieves' sacrifice fly in the 11th
inning gave the Chicago Cubs a 3-2 win Saturday over the San
Francisco Giants, just the Cubs' eighth win in 24 road games this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Rodriguez opened the 11th with a double off Aaron Fultz
(1-1). Pinch-runner Chad Meyers moved to third on a groundout and,
after a walk, scored on Nieves' fly to right.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Garibay (1-1) pitched two hitless innings for the win.
Rick Aguilera pitched the 11th for his eighth save in 12
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   After being held scoreless on one hit for the first 7 2-3
innings, the Cubs tied the game at 2 on back-to-back homers by
Rodriguez and Julio Zuleta off reliever John Johnstone.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's 12th homer of the season went into the seats above
the brick wall in right-center. Zuleta's first major league homer,
capping a 12-pitch at-bat, went to left field.
</P>
<P>
   The two homers deprived San Francisco starter Russ Ortiz of a
win after a roller-coaster performance in which he allowed one hit
in six scoreless innings -- striking out a career-high 11 and
matching his career high with seven walks.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz allowed only a double by Willie Greene in the fifth. He
struck out the side in the fourth and fifth innings, got Sammy Sosa
twice on strikes and whiffed Zuleta three times.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz walked two in the first and walked three straight batters
with two outs in the third. But he retired Rodriguez on strikes to
end the threat in the first, and got Rodriguez to line to right
with the bases loaded in the third.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth inning, after a one-out walk to Eric Young and
Greene's double put two runners in scoring position, Ortiz struck
out Sosa and Jeff Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Kent and Ellis Burks had RBI singles in the first for the
Giants, who opened the series with a 5-3 win over the Cubs on
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Downs allowed two runs on seven hits in six innings for
the Cubs, who broke a five-game losing streak in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Ortiz has allowed three or more walks in 42 of his 56
career starts. ... The Cubs have had back-to-back homers six times
this season. ... Johnston had his third blown save of the season.
... The 11 strikeouts by Ortiz were the most by a Giants pitcher
since Shawn Estes also had 11 on June 15, 1998, against Colorado.

<HEADLINE> Siamese Twins Die After Separation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALERMO, Sicily (AP) -- Surgeons in Sicily succeeded Saturday in
separating 3-month-old Siamese twin girls, but both infants died
within hours, surgeons said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors had told Marta Milagro Pascual Juarez, 22, of Peru, that
to save one of the girls they would have to sacrifice the other
baby. The girls were joined at the chest and shared the same heart
and liver.
</P>
<P>
   By sacrificing the weaker of the two, Milagro, doctors hoped
they could save the other, Marta. But six hours after Milagro's
death, Marta's heart stopped.
</P>
<P>
   When the operation began around midnight ''they were already on
the limits of survival,'' Dr. Carlo Marcelletti, chief of the
operating team, told a news conference at Palermo's main public
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   With Milagro's respiratory problems straining the girls' one
heart and endangering both their lives, the hospital's bioethics
committee gave its approval for the separation surgery. One
surgeon, however, refused to participate, saying it would
''suppress a human life.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother originally flew with the twins to Miami in the hopes
the operation would be carried in the United States. When it could
not be arranged, they were put in contact with the Palermo
hospital.

<HEADLINE> Braves 6, Astros 5  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- John Rocker got the biggest boos and didn't get
anyone out. Fortunately for the Atlanta Braves, they still had
Kerry Ligtenberg in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   After his abrupt greeting by Houston fans, Rocker walked the
bases loaded with no outs in the bottom of the ninth inning before
Ligtenberg came on to preserve the Braves' 6-5 victory Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones, Brian Jordan and Chipper Jones hit home runs for
the Braves in cooled-down Enron Field.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to have a little luck in this game,'' Braves manager
Bobby Cox said. ''It didn't look like we were going to get any
strikes thrown. In that situation you are looking for a pop out,
anything to get an out.''
</P>
<P>
   After Rocker walked the bases loaded in the ninth inning and
threw one pitch -- a ball -- to Daryle Ward, Cox had seen enough and
Ligtenberg took over.
</P>
<P>
   Ward hit a line drive to strong-armed center fielder Andruw
Jones, and Bill Spiers stayed at third rather than take a chance on
tagging up.
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg then got Richard Hidalgo to ground into a game-ending
double play.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was basically trying to throw as hard as I could and hit my
spots,'' Ligtenberg said. ''I didn't know how I was going to do it,
I was just trying to get some outs. I was trying to get some guys
to pop out or hit some ground balls.''
</P>
<P>
   The one-run loss was Houston's 13th in 14 games this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I missed my pitch earlier,'' Hidalgo said. ''I was trying to
get my pitch and drive it, but I missed my pitch and then I hit the
ground ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones thought Spiers would score from third on Ward's
fly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he would have scored, about a 95 percent chance,''
Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ''Maybe they could have made a
hero throw, but I doubt it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros lost more than the game. Left fielder Moises Alou
left the game with tightness in his left quadriceps muscle one day
after outfielder Roger Cedeno was placed on the 15-day disabled
list. Alou was listed as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves got the early lead in the first regular-season game
played at Enron Field with the roof closed. It was 72 degrees
inside with the air conditioning while temperatures outside rose
into the 90s.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Caminiti hit a solo home run in the seventh and Lance
Berkman hit a two-run homer in the eighth, giving the Astros homers
in 14 straight games, tying a club record.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 91 home runs hit in Enron Field this season in
24 games. There were a combined 118 for all of last season in the
Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Quilvio Veras doubled and scored on Chipper Jones' sacrifice fly
in the first inning off Shane Reynolds (5-1). Veras singled in the
third and scored on Andruw Jones' homer for a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   John Burkett loaded the bases in the third on walks to Spiers
and Alou and a single by Jeff Bagwell. Hidalgo singled home a run
and Berkman had an RBI grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan hit a solo in the sixth and Chipper Jones' two-run homer
in the eighth ended Reynolds' day. He allowed eight hits, six
earned runs, walked one and struck out three.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett (4-2) pitched six innings, gave up seven hits, two
earned runs and five strikeouts for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Alou is hitting .330 in 26 games this season with six home runs
and 18 RBIs. He walked twice before leaving the game.
</P>
<P>
   Alou missed last season recovering from surgery to repair a torn
anterior cruciate ligament on his left knee. Cedeno is on the
disabled list with a broken left hand.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The victory gave the Braves 20 consecutive winning months.
... Atlanta's Bobby Bonilla has three consecutive pinch-hits. ...
Bagwell leads the Astros by grounding into seven double plays,
including the fourth inning Saturday. ... Prior to the game, the
Astros sent infielder Russ Johnson to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for
Marc Valdes.

<HEADLINE> Ewing Misses Game 3 Against Indiana  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Patrick Ewing pulled himself out of New York's
lineup shortly before Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals when
he saw he couldn't run on his injured right foot. He still hopes to
play in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Dudley, who had played a total of 10 minutes this
postseason before Saturday, started in place of Ewing as the Knicks
beat the Indiana Pacers 98-95 to cut their deficit to 2-1 in the
best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried to run right before the game. I couldn't do it,''
Ewing said. ''I tested it in the locker room. I came with the
intention to try to play and that's what I did. I couldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing hurt the foot during the first quarter of Thursday's Game
2 and sat out the rest of the way. He sat on New York's bench
Saturday, wearing a gray suit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Patrick was re-evaluated this morning. He is improving and the
soreness is diminishing, but he will not play today,'' Knicks team
doctor Norman Scott said. ''His status is day-to-day for Monday's
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The teams play in New York on Monday and in Indianapolis on
Wednesday, and Ewing said he expects to be in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the reasons I didn't go today was to get my ankle, my
leg, my foot, whatever it is a couple of days to rest,'' Ewing
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I'll be able to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Dudley played 25 minutes and hit two free throws in the second
half for his only points.
</P>
<P>
   The teams have been in this position before. Ewing's 1999 season
ended in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals, also against
Indiana, when his left Achilles' tendon gave out. New York won
three of the last four games in that series to win it 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we've been through every scenario with Patrick's
injury over the past few years,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said
before Saturday's tipoff. ''We're losing the best player we've had
over the last four or five games of the playoffs, but there's going
to be no mental effect. ...
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't feel sorry for ourselves. We can't have this on our
minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy is used to preparing his team without Ewing, who
missed this season's first 20 games while recovering from a
partially torn Achilles' tendon. The Knicks went 11-9 during that
span, and 39-23 the rest of the way, with Ewing in the starting
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Through New York's first 12 playoff games -- an opening-round
sweep of the Toronto Raptors, a seven-game defeat of Miami in the
second round, and the first two games against Indiana -- Ewing
averaged 14.4 points, third on the team, and a team-high 9.5
rebounds.

<HEADLINE> Little Guys Help Out the Knicks  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The little guys did all the little things right
for the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   There was Charlie Ward rotating over from far off the ball to
swat 7-foot-4 Rik Smits' baseline jumper into the third row of
seats. There was Chris Childs grabbing defensive rebounds in the
fourth quarter. There were Ward, Larry Johnson and Allan Houston
flying into the passing lanes, forcing a team that normally takes
care of the ball into turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   With 7-foot center Patrick Ewing out from the start with a right
foot injury, and 6-11 Marcus Camby injured in the second quarter,
the Knicks needed every last one of those hustle plays from their
smaller players to beat the Indiana Pacers 98-95 on Saturday in
Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   New York cut its deficit in the best-of-seven series to 2-1,
with Game 4 at Madison Square Garden on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew it was going to be tough without our two centers. But
we had everybody come in and do their part,'' said Latrell
Sprewell, who had a game-high 32 points.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, injured in Thursday's Game 3, did his best Spike Lee
imitation, waving an orange towel and yelling encouragement to his
teammates from the bench. Camby sprained his right knee when the
leg buckled under him as he drove along the right side of the lane
with 8:49 left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Without their two leading rebounders (Ewing had been averaging
9.5, Camby 8.8 in the playoffs) and with little inside presence,
the Knicks turned into a run-and-fun team, looking for fast-break
opportunities whenever possible. Coach Jeff Van Gundy looked like a
baseball third-base coach waving his runners home, windmilling his
arms to indicate he wanted the Knicks to push the ball upcourt.
</P>
<P>
   It helped that Sprewell, all of 6-5, took over at the offensive
end. The middle was open for him and he took advantage, mixing a
series of slashes to the basket with an array of outside shots. The
6-6 Houston scored 28.
</P>
<P>
   Ward was everywhere, particularly in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did a lot of good things, got his hands on a lot of loose
balls,'' Van Gundy said. ''He found ways to get the ball at the
basket. He really stepped forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The point guard sparked a 26-15 Knicks run in the third quarter
that turned a two-point deficit for New York into a 71-62 lead. He
had eight points and four assists in the spurt, and finished with
14 points and nine assists.
</P>
<P>
   Childs had four points, two assists, a block and four rebounds --
all at the defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   Ward also came up with three steals during that Knicks outburst,
part of 17 Pacers turnovers that New York converted into 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana had been averaging eight turnovers in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, who won the 1993 Heisman Trophy at Florida State but was
considered too short to be an NFL quarterback, smacked away the
shot by Smits, who is 14 inches taller, with less than a minute to
go in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was kind of funny,'' Ward said. ''If a guy didn't jump and
he is 7-foot-4 he becomes as small as you are.''
</P>
<P>
   It was part of a rough second half for Smits, the lanky Dutchman
who burned the shorter Knicks for 21 points in the first half -- but
finished the game with 25.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just saw Charlie jump,'' Houston said. ''He looked like he
was jumping over a car or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite, but Ward certainly helped steer the Knicks to a
must-have victory.

Clinton Welcomes Ulster Unionist Vote
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton welcomed today's decision of Northern
Ireland's Protestants to revive their power-sharing government with the region's
Catholics. ''I am delighted that ... the Northern Ireland peace process is back
on track,'' Clinton said. He said the Ulster Unionist Party vote to bring back
the arrangement was a ''giant step'' toward fulfilling the 1998 U.S.-mediated
peace agreement. It established a power-sharing government with representatives
of pro-British Northern Ireland unionists and Sinn Fein, the mainly Roman
Catholic party linked to the outlawed Irish Republican Army.

13-year-old Nathaniel Brazill remain in custody while a grand jury decides
whether the honor student should be tried in Barry Grunow's death. The

the city of Adikeyhe, joining what Eritrea says are hundreds of thousands of
others displaced by Ethiopia's 2-week-old offensive. African diplomats announced
Friday that Eritrea had agreed to resume peace talks and to surrender two key
towns demanded by its Horn of Africa neighbor. But Ethiopia insisted again
Saturday the offensive would stop only when it was satisfied Eritrea had truly

''lowest possible number consistent with our national security,'' even without
Russia making cuts. The Texas governor paired the cuts with a broad national
security review that must include a missile defense system. He also opposes a
treaty that bans worldwide tests of nuclear weapons.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Vet Finally Buried in N.M.  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE KOIDIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) -- Two brothers of Andres Garcia bent over
and kissed his casket Saturday, a tearful sister saluted as
''Taps'' was played and the family of the Marine killed at the end
of the Vietnam war finally got to say good-bye.
</P>
<P>
   They had waited 25 years to hold a funeral for Garcia, who was a
20-year-old lance corporal when he became one of the last American
combat casualties in Southeast Asia. His remains were recovered
only in the past few years and the family learned of the positive
identification two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 400 or so mourners Saturday was a survivor of the
Mayaguez Incident in which Garcia died off the coast of a Cambodian
island on May 15, 1975, two weeks after the war officially ended.
</P>
<P>
   During a service at the First Baptist Church of Carlsbad, family
members broke down in tears as a video montage was shown on a
screen above the altar. Photographs of Garcia growing up were mixed
in with images of American flags and the Vietnam memorial wall in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   With the flag-draped casket and a framed photo of Garcia in
uniform before him, Pastor Bob Bacon thanked Garcia for giving his
life for his country.
</P>
<P>
   ''He gave everything that a human being can give,'' Bacon told
the relatives, friends, veterans and community members who filled
the church. ''Andy said 'yes' to freedom's price, not only with his
voice but with his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale Clark, the Mayaguez Incident survivor who attended the
funeral, said he flew in from Seattle to support the family and to
get closure for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, 43, and Clark were among about 200 Marines sent on a
daring mission to rescue the 39 American crewmen of the merchant
ship Mayaguez, which had been captured by Khmer Rouge patrol boats
in the Gulf of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen U.S. servicemen, including Garcia, were killed or lost
when their helicopter was hit by a rocket from Khmer Rouge troops.
Five others also died or went missing in action after the battle.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 7, Brewers 3  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Tony Womack extended his hitting streak to 22
games and scored twice and the Arizona Diamondbacks stretched their
team-record home winning string to 11, beating the Milwaukee
Brewers 7-3 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Gonzalez also homered for Arizona, which has won five
straight overall. Milwaukee has lost four in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Finley hit his 18th homer and drove in three runs, raising
his NL-leading RBIs total to 51. His two-run homer in the fifth
inning tied it and Jay Bell singled home the go-ahead run in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Reynoso (3-4) allowed two runs in six innings.
Byung-Hyun Kim retired the last five batters for his fifth save in
six chances.
</P>
<P>
   Womack doubled and singled in extending the longest hitting
streak in the majors this season.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Hanley Frias had a two-run single in the seventh
and Gonzalez homered in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Erubiel Durazo singled with two outs in the fifth and Finley
followed with a 418-foot drive onto a pavilion that juts out over
the field in left-center, tying it at 3.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Ward, the next batter, singled off the left ankle of
starter Jason Bere, forcing him from the game.
</P>
<P>
   In the next inning, reliever Juan Acevedo (0-2) got one out
before Womack doubled and scored on Bell's single.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Sweeney doubled twice in his first start with the Brewers
and drove in a run.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers took a 3-1 lead in the fifth when Bere tripled with
one out, hitting a sinking liner to right that got past a charging
Ward. After Reynoso walked Ron Belliard, Mark Loretta hit an RBI
single and scored on Sweeney's second double.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee got an unearned run in the first after a throwing
error by Andy Fox, playing third base to rest Matt Williams. The
Diamondbacks tied it in their half on an RBI groundout by Finley.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Finley tied his franchise record for homers in a month with
nine. He also had nine homers last September and this April. ...
Bere gave up a home run for the seventh straight start. ...
Loretta, who saved his hitting streak in his last at-bat Friday
night, had two hits and increased it to 11 games. ... Lyle Mouton
and Belliard felt hamstring pain Friday night, but both were back
in uniform. Belliard made his 50th consecutive start at second
base. ... Williams got the day off because of the short turnaround
between games. He returned from the DL on Tuesday and started the
next four games at third. ... Sweeney had not started a game since
Sept. 18, 1998, against Colorado when he was with San Diego.

<HEADLINE> Tigers 4, Blue Jays 3  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY ATKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Deivi Cruz stroked an RBI single in the ninth
inning to lift the Detroit Tigers to a 4-3 win over the Toronto
Blue Jays on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Brocail (2-3) pitched the last 1 2-3 innings for the
victory, holding the Blue Jays hitless after relieving Hideo Nomo.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Quantrill (0-2) walked Brad Ausmus to start the Tigers'
ninth. Ausmus moved up on a sacrifice bunt by Jose Macias and
scored on Cruz's single to right.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Palmer hit a two-run homer for Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   An RBI single by Carlos Delgado drove in Craig Grebeck, who had
singled, to tie it at 3 in the Toronto eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Munro walked Bobby Higginson to start the Detroit second
and Palmer followed with his eighth homer over the left-field wall
for a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays tied it at 2 with two outs in the fifth on Shannon
Stewart's bases-loaded single.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit loaded the bases with no outs in the fifth, but settled
for just one run on Rich Becker's RBI grounder that might have been
a double play if second baseman Grebeck hadn't bobbled the ball
momentarily before getting the force at second.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the next batter -- Gregg Jefferies -- did ground into a
double play, ending the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto had a runner on third with one out in the seventh, but
Jefferies threw Tony Batista out at the plate on a grounder to
first, and Nomo got Alex Gonzalez on a fly to left to end the
threat.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo allowed three runs and seven hits with five walks and eight
strikeouts in 7 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Munro, making his second start for Toronto, gave up three runs
and six hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes@: Stewart extended his hitting streak to 11 games. Nomo,
thanks to two double plays and a caught-stealing, faced just three
batters in each of the first three innings ... Shane Halter
replaced Juan Gonzalez in right field for Detroit to start the
eighth. Gonzalez was reported to have a strained left foot.

<HEADLINE> Stasi Files on Kohl Missing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Officials in charge of the East German spy agency
records seem to have lost track of the files containing the results
of wiretaps on former Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors confirmed this month that they had
confiscated thousands of records from the so-called Stasi agency
which had been secretly obtained by a Bonn-based journalist after
German unification.
</P>
<P>
   The files reportedly contained the results of phone taps and
other electronic surveillance on leading West German politicians,
but none on Kohl.
</P>
<P>
   The journalist, Paul Limbach, told Der Spiegel newsmagazine he
had given Kohl the files that related to him in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   A Kohl spokesman said Saturday that the agency charged with
overseeing Stasi files had sent a request asking him to hand the
files over. But he said Kohl replied that he has no such records in
his possession.
</P>
<P>
   Stasi files on former West German politicians have figured into
the scandal around Kohl's Christian Democratic party over its
illegal financial practices.
</P>
<P>
   A parliament committee investigating bribery charges during his
16 years in power has decided it won't use Stasi files as evidence.
But lawmakers say they will still ask witnesses questions based on
media reports about the files.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Extends Loans for Turkey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- The World Bank extended a $759.6 million
loan to Turkey Saturday to help the country carry out its ambitious
economic reform program.
</P>
<P>
   The loan is the first chunk of more than $5 billion the World
Bank said it would make available over a three-year period to help
Turkey implement a strict International Monetary Fund-backed
anti-inflation program, reform its banking system and boost its
struggling economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are totally aligned with ... the terms of the program they
have articulated,'' said World Bank President James Wolfensohn
after signing the loan agreement with Recep Onal, the Turkish state
minister in charge of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Onal said the loan would be used to reform public spending,
social security, agriculture, energy and privatize state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   The loan is repayable over 15 years with a five-year grace
period.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly one-year-old government of Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit looks strong enough to carry out the reforms, unlike
previous fragile coalition governments.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a unique opportunity,'' Wolfensohn said. ''This is an
extremely important moment and one that hasn't been around for a
long while in Turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the World Bank approved a $757.3 million loan to help
Turkey rebuild after two earthquakes left more than 18,000 people
dead and several hundred thousand homeless.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans Meat Nutrition Labels  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Whether it's a box of Wheaties or a package of
hamburger meat, consumers should have easy access to nutritional
information, President Clinton said Saturday. He proposed that the
government require labels on meat and poultry for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Nutritional labels, required for processed food since 1994, tell
shoppers just how much fat, cholesterol, calories and nutrients are
in each serving.
</P>
<P>
   ''Providing citizens with accurate information that affects
their lives is one of government's most vital responsibilities,''
Clinton said Saturday in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
   But information alone won't help, he said: ''Citizens have a
responsibility to use that information wisely.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also released updated nutritional guidelines that advise
more exercise, safe handling of food and moderated sugar
consumption. They also suggest that Americans pay attention to
nutritional labels.
</P>
<P>
   About six in 10 supermarkets post nutrition information near
their meat cases, and some major meatpackers and poultry companies
voluntarily put nutrition labels on packages.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Clinton said, ''It's time we made it mandatory.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We wholeheartedly believe in the consumers being informed,''
said Mary Young, a nutritionist with the National Cattlemen's Beef
Association. Nutrition information ''not only helps them understand
lean cuts of meat but it also helps them understand that meat is
packed with iron and zinc.''
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department will gather comments about the
proposal, which could take effect by the end of the year but may
stretch into 2001.
</P>
<P>
   It's the latest in a series of food safety and nutrition
initiatives from the administration. This month Clinton ordered new
testing requirements for listeria, a pathogen in processed meats.
The Food and Drug Administration has proposed expanding nutrition
labels on processed foods to include artery-clogging trans fatty
acids, a common ingredient in baked goods.
</P>
<P>
   The government's new dietary guidelines for Americans, also
released Saturday, are revised every five years to reflect new
scientific research.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 version takes an upbeat approach -- ''Eating is one of
life's greatest pleasures,'' it says -- and adds sections
emphasizing the importance of whole grains, exercise and safe
handling of food.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Americans make better choices about healthy eating,
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yet despite this progress, the vast majority of Americans
don't have healthy diets,'' the president said. ''We're eating more
fast food because of our hectic schedules, and we're less
physically active because of our growing reliance on modern
conveniences, from cars to computers to remote controls.''
</P>
<P>
   The USDA guidelines, contained in a 39-page booklet, largely
followed recommendations of an advisory panel of 11 nutrition
experts.
</P>
<P>
   The administration bowed to criticism from the food and soft
drink industry, however, and weakened recommendations for the
section on sugar that urged consumers to ''limit'' consumption of
sugary foods and beverages. The final version says consumers should
''moderate'' sugar intake and also deletes the panel's conclusion
that Americans have been increasing their consumption of sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman defended the change, saying
it makes the recommendations parallel with those that encourage
''moderate consumption'' of alcohol and fat.
</P>
<P>
   The food industry, pleased that they do not label ''good foods''
and ''bad foods,'' welcomed the guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ''The guidelines wisely avoid the blame game of unscientific
accusations aimed at particular industries or foods,'' Lisa Katic
of the Grocery Manufacturers of America said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Margo Wootan, a nutritionist with the Center for Science in the
Public Interest, consumer advocates, said the administration
''totally caved'' to the industry in altering the sugar section.
</P>
<P>
   ''But in general the guidelines are an improvement over what
they currently are,'' Wootan added. ''It encourages people to eat a
more plant-based diet, and it puts more emphasis on fruits and
vegetables.''
</P>
<P>
   Federally funded nutrition programs have to adhere to the
dietary guidelines, which were first published in 1980. They also
are used widely by professionals and dietitians in advising
consumers.

<HEADLINE> Swimmers Rave About Fastskin Suit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- At least one of America's top swimmers
is already sold on the new Fastskin swimsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The swimsuit, made by Speedo, is getting its first major test in
a national competition during the Key Bank Swim Classic at
Michigan's Canham Natatorium.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day meet, which concludes Sunday, is the first of five
in the Cadillac Challenge Swim Series leading up to the U.S.
Olympic Trials in August.
</P>
<P>
   The Fastskin is a rubberized, skintight body suit that resembles
a diver's wet suit. It's supposed to cut down on water resistance,
and many of the elite swimmers were wearing them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think these suits are the best,'' said 1996 Olympic champion
Amy Van Dyken. ''Speedo really hit the nail on the head with
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Dyken was sure the suit helped her to one of her best
in-season times, a 25.63 clocking in Friday's 50-meter freestyle
final. That was the first competitive race in more than six months
for Van Dyken, who has been bothered by a shoulder injury that
required surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Former Michigan All-American Tom Malchow, the 1996 Olympic
silver medalist in the 200 butterfly, wore a regular suit for
Friday morning's 400 freestyle preliminaries. He barely qualified
for the final, clocking 4:02.06, before putting on the Fastskin for
the evening final and finishing second in 3:54.78.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's eight seconds,'' Malchow said. ''I don't know if that
was it. But it is something that you need to try out and see if
it's good for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Another 1996 Olympic champion, Cristina Teuscher, tried the new
suit for the first time Friday and shattered pool records in both
the 400 freestyle and 200 individual medley.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to jump on the bandwagon right away,'' Teuscher
said, ''but I really, really like it in the freestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Teuscher, who graduated from Columbia University last week with
a bachelor's degree in psychology, said any advantage from the
Fastskin could be ''very mental.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But whatever you feel is good for you probably is,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Teuscher wore a conventional swimsuit in Saturday's competition.
She was touched out in the 400 individual medley by Kaitlin
Sandeno, who clocked a pool-record 4:45.19 to Teuscher's 4:45.33.
</P>
<P>
   In other women's finals Saturday, Ashley Tappin won the 100
butterfly (1:00.33); Samantha Arsenault the 200 freestyle
(2:01.38); Kristy Kowal the 100 breast stroke (1:08.68); and Lea
Maurer the 100 backstroke (1:02.09). All were pool records.
</P>
<P>
   Malchow won the men's 100 butterfly in a pool-record 54.78
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Other men's winners were Tom Wilkens in the 400 individual
medley (4:22.50); Adam Messner in the 200 freestyle (1:51.76);
Jarrod Marrs in the 100 breast stroke (1:04.10) and Neil Walker in
the 100 backstroke (55.65). Messner's time was a pool record.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Activate Radinsky From DL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Cardinals activated left-handed
pitcher Scott Radinsky on Saturday and placed reliever Mike James
on the 15-day disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Radinsky ended the 1999 season on the disabled list and has
missed 47 games. Manager Tony La Russa said Radinsky was available
to pitch Saturday against the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Radinsky was placed on the disabled list last July with a
strained left elbow. He had complied a 2-1 record with three saves
and a 4.88 ERA up to that point.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals put James onto the DL with a right shoulder
strain. Against Florida on Thursday, James lasted just one-third of
an inning, surrendering back-to-back homers in relief of starter
Rick Ankiel.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander is 0-1 with a 4.80 ERA and has allowed six
homers in 15 innings.

<HEADLINE> Explosion After Train Derails in La.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUNICE, La. (AP) -- Freight cars loaded with hazardous chemicals
exploded and caught fire after a Union Pacific freight train
derailed Saturday, sending fireballs into the sky and forcing the
evacuation of thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported. About 3,500 people were ordered to
evacuate homes and business up to 2{ miles from the wreck because
soot fell on neighborhoods beyond the first evacuation area, state
Trooper E.J. Chesne said. The fire after the derailment set nearby
woods ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   About 350 people had been ordered from within a mile of the
accident when the evacuation was broadened.
</P>
<P>
   Union Pacific had rented 40 hotel rooms for evacuees at a Best
Western motel two miles from the wreck. ''But now they're
evacuating us, too,'' Patty Deculus (DEC'-yoo-lus), a desk clerk
there, said.
</P>
<P>
   State police Sgt. Richard Hazelwood said 29 cars derailed and at
least 10 caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   The blast shattered windows up to a quarter-mile away. An
explosion nearly two hours after the initial derailment sent a
fireball 150 to 200 feet into the air, said Peter Piazza, a
newspaper photographer who witnessed the fireball.
</P>
<P>
   Flames appeared to rise 50 to 70 feet from other burning cars
and there appeared to be flames as far as a mile down the track,
said Piazza, who viewed the derailment from a helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Chesne said the worst chemicals in the wreckage were methyl
chloride, acrylic acid, toluene diisocyanate, and dichloropropane.
</P>
<P>
   Methyl chloride is used to make silicones, agricultural
chemicals, methyl cellulose, and butyl rubber.
</P>
<P>
   Large amounts can cause convulsions, coma, and death. Lower
amounts can cause staggering, blurred or double vision, dizziness,
and fatigue, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Toluene diisocyanate is flammable and can irritate the lungs,
skin and eyes when touched or inhaled. It is used to coat tinted
glass.
</P>
<P>
   Dichloropropane can cause shortness of breath, coughs and chest
discomfort, and can make the linings of the eyelid bleed. It is
widely used to make carbon tetrachloride, and also as an oil and
fat solvent in certain furniture finishes, dry cleaning fluids, and
paint removers.
</P>
<P>
   Acrylic acid is a clear liquid with a sharp odor. Breathing its
vapors irritates the lungs, nose and throat.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Davis, regional spokesman for the railroad in Omaha, Neb.,
said the train was heading from Freeport, Texas, to Livonia, La.,
when it derailed shortly before noon in Eunice, 77 miles west of
Baton Rouge.

Ethiopia Continues Eritrea Assault

   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) -- Despite a new agreement for peace talks, Ethiopian
forces drove deeper into Eritrea on Saturday and shelled a city just 50 miles
from their adversary's capital. Civilians fled ahead of the Ethiopian move on
the city of Adikeyhe, joining what Eritrea says are hundreds of thousands of
others displaced by Ethiopia's 2-week-old offensive. African diplomats announced
Friday that Eritrea had agreed to resume peace talks and to surrender two key
towns demanded by its Horn of Africa neighbor. But Ethiopia insisted again
Saturday the offensive would stop only when it was satisfied Eritrea had truly

Yankees Defeat Red Sox 8-3
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter went 3-for-4 with a steal and
RBI single today as New York beat the Boston Red Sox 8-3. Jeter, who had been on
the disabled list since May 11 because of a strained abdominal muscle, stopped
an 0-for-14 slide, his longest since April 1997, with a third-inning single.
After Jorge Posada's tiebreaking homer off John Wasdin (0-1) put the Yankees
ahead 4-3 in a five-run sixth, Jeter added an RBI single and Paul O'Neill
followed with a three-run homer off Tim Young. New York won for just the fifth
time in 12 games and again tied Boston for the AL East lead.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Honor Dizzy Dean  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Dizzy Dean will have a place forever at Busch
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Cardinals honored the late Hall of Famer on
Saturday, putting a statue of the colorful pitcher outside their
ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're still having fun playing the game,'' sculptor Harry
Weber said. ''They're playing the game the way Dizzy and (his
brother) Paul played.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals unveiled the statue before their game against the
New York Mets. It's the sixth statue of a former Cardinal the team
has placed outside Busch, joining Enos Slaughter, Bob Gibson, Lou
Brock, Stan Musial, and Red Schoendienst.
</P>
<P>
   The team will add a statue of Rogers Hornsby in August.
</P>
<P>
   Dizzy Dean played with the Cardinals in 1930, and from 1932 to
1937. His brother, Paul, played in St. Louis from 1934 to 1939. The
Dean brothers combined for 49 wins in 1934.
</P>
<P>
   That season, Dizzy Dean went 30-7. He's the last pitcher in the
National League to win 30 games. Between 1932 and 1936, Dean won
120 games and recorded 970 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Dizzy Dean, who died in 1974, never had any children. All four
of brother Paul's children -- and about 40 family members -- were at
the unveiling Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The St. Louis Cardinals have a great history, and Diz and my
father were part of that history,'' Sandy Dean said. ''Diz would be
very proud of this day.''

<HEADLINE> Nevada Conservatives Score Victory  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT SONNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) -- Nevada Republicans defeated an
anti-abortion plank that had sharply divided the party Saturday as
convention delegates approved an otherwise staunchly conservative
state platform.
</P>
<P>
   From support of school prayer in schools to a ban on gays in the
military and same-sex marriages, conservative hardliners prevailed
on most of the hotly contested social issues debated at the state
GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   The only other significant victory for moderates came when they
amended a plank that called for opposition to the Endangered
Species Act, instead urging ''serious reform'' of the wildlife
protection law.
</P>
<P>
   Other parts of the platform range from a declaration of state
supremacy over federal lands in Nevada, to withdrawing from the
United Nations and keeping fluoride out of public water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada's GOP also went on record against the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration's implementation of new ergonomics
regulations, a plank added by those fearful government inspectors
will enter their home offices.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have enough jack-booted thugs in the federal government as
it is,'' said Marvin Wakefield of Carson City.
</P>
<P>
   The most contentious fight was over whether to include any
mention of abortion in the platform at all after Gov. Kenny Guinn
and other GOP leaders on Friday had urged delegates to put their
differences aside and make the party more inclusive.
</P>
<P>
   On a 166-149 vote, delegates defeated the plank urging support
of the ''unalienable right to life for every person from conception
to a natural death.'' That means the platform is silent on the
topic.
</P>
<P>
   ''This finally says that Republicans don't want abortion in
politics,'' said Ann Thompson of Reno, state chairman of
Republicans for Pro-Choice.

<HEADLINE> Ulster Unionists Back Power Share  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Northern Ireland's bitterly
divided major Protestant party voted Saturday to revive a joint
government with Catholics, but the party's leader warned the
coalition would survive only if the Irish Republican Army disarms.
</P>
<P>
   The grassroots council of the Ulster Unionist party decided by a
459-403 vote to resume power-sharing alongside the IRA-linked Sinn
Fein starting Tuesday. The outcome won quick praise from Britain,
Ireland and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''The wind is back in the sails of peace in Northern Ireland,''
President Clinton declared in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The province's power-sharing government began operating in
December, ending 27 years of direct rule by Britain, but it was
suspended 11 weeks later because the IRA refused to make any
disarmament commitments. The IRA broke the impasse three weeks ago,
promising to begin putting its weapons ''beyond use'' -- a euphemism
for disarming -- if power-sharing resumed.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams, speaking in New York, called
the vote the ''right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The onus is now on everyone to honor their commitments,
especially the British government,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Saturday's vote, Ulster Unionist chief David Trimble
argued during a behind-closed-doors debate that his party must test
the IRA's promise. With his leadership on the line, Trimble got
backing from 53 percent of the party council.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is patently obvious that those promises must be
delivered,'' a relieved but still vulnerable Trimble said
afterward. ''And let there be absolutely no doubt that I and my
colleagues will hold the republicans to the promises they have
made. If there's any foot-dragging, if there's any delay, there
will be difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein and the province's biggest Catholic-supported party,
the Social Democratic and Labor Party, welcomed Trimble's narrow
victory as essential to ensuring the success of the Good Friday
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   That landmark 1998 pact envisioned a Catholic-Protestant
administration buoyed by gradual paramilitary disarmament. Though
progress has been slowed by mutual suspicions, the continuing
cease-fires observed by the IRA and outlawed pro-British groups
have helped keep the process alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''Inclusivity, equality and mutual respect is the way forward,''
said Martin McGuinness, a former IRA chief of staff due to resume
work as Sinn Fein's education minister in the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   The British minister for Northern Ireland, Peter Mandelson, said
he had signed an order restoring substantial authority to the
four-party Cabinet, effective Tuesday. He will retain considerable
responsibilities, including maintaining security in the province.
</P>
<P>
   ''Northern Ireland today has a second chance to get it right,''
Mandelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Northern Ireland's unlikely local coalition flowers or
withers once again will largely depend on IRA actions.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein declined to speculate on when the IRA would begin to
reveal any of its secret weapons dumps to international inspectors.
That was the most concrete commitment made by the outlawed group in
its May 6 declaration to put its weapons ''completely and
verifiably beyond use.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimble shared the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize with Catholic leader
John Hume, and he is the senior minister in the province's
soon-to-be-revived Cabinet. But Saturday's vote confirmed that he
retains only a shaky hold on his own party.
</P>
<P>
   His deputy leader, John Taylor, said he had been prepared to
vote no until he received assurances from Britain that it intended
to retain two key symbols of Britishness in Northern Ireland: the
name of the province's mostly Protestant police force, the Royal
Ulster Constabulary, and the flying of Union Jack flags over
government buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has insisted that the police should be renamed as part
of a plan to reform the force, which many Catholics despise. But
before the vote, Mandelson suggested that the RUC name might be
retained in some form. In a further bid to help Trimble, he
announced he would have the final say on whether the British flag
flew over government buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we'd held this meeting last Saturday we would have lost,''
Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Unionists, an uncompromising Protestant party
opposed to the entire Good Friday accord, predicted it would soon
represent most of the province's pro-British majority and pull the
plug on power-sharing. The party has two government posts, though
it refuses to sit at the same Cabinet table as Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Unionist leader Ian Paisley said his party ''will
provide a reliable alternative to Trimble's surrender unionism.''

<HEADLINE> Mariners 6, Devil Rays 3  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Brett Tomko was good, and Seattle's
bullpen was even better.
</P>
<P>
   Tomko allowed three hits in five-plus innings, and four Mariners
relievers limited Tampa Bay to one hit to finish a 6-3 victory over
the struggling Devil Rays, who went down in order in the seventh,
eighth and ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what you really want to see, isn't it,'' Seattle
manager Lou Piniella said of the work of Rob Ramsay, Frankie
Rodriguez, Arthur Rhodes and closer Kazuhiro Sasaki.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a combination of everything. The hitters are putting up
some runs ... and our pitching is getting it done,'' said Tomko
(3-2), who made his first start since stiffness in his right
shoulder forced out in the fourth inning of an outing against Tampa
Bay on May 19.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of what I battled this week, I kind of backed off
everything and decided not to try to overpower everybody. I just
kind of hit my spots and let the ball work. ... I was a little
worried going into the game with what happened last time, but I
responded good.''
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud's two-run single snapped a fifth-inning tie, and the
Mariners also got a pair of RBI singles from Mark McLemore to beat
the Devil Rays for the second second straight game after beginning
a six-day road trip with three losses at Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay (15-32) has dropped eight series in a row and has the
worst record in the major leagues. The latest loss wasn't the only
bad news of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Designated hitter Jose Canseco, a late scratch from the lineup
because of a strained left heel, was placed on the 15-day disabled
list after the game. He has been slowed by an assortment of
injuries, although his absence from the lineup Thursday and Friday
was slump-related -- not for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are not serious injuries. They are just nagging ...
Hopefully this will take care of it,'' said manager Larry
Rothschild, who benched the slugger for two games to give him a
chance to take extra batting practice and work on his swing.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco, who's hitting .225 with three homers in May, was
penciled into the lineup, but had difficulty running in warmups and
was removed just before gametime. He's batting .261 with seven
homers overall.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to try to continue,'' Canseco said, explaining
that the foot has been bothering him for awhile but seemed to be
improving before Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Castilla homered off Tomko for Tampa Bay, and the Devil
Rays scored twice in the sixth without the benefit of a hit.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore's RBI single off Bryan Rekar (1-3) gave the Mariners a
4-1 lead in the top of the sixth. His single off Rick White made
5-3 in the eighth, and Jay Buhner drove in Seattle's final run with
a ninth-inning, pinch-hit single.
</P>
<P>
   Rekar, pitching on three days' rest, was coming off his
strongest outing of the season -- a club-record 5 2-3-inning relief
stint against Oakland that got him his first win since last July
10. He limited Seattle to two hits -- one of them Raul Ibanez's RBI
double -- through four innings, but the Mariners kept pecking away.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud snapped a 1-1 tie with his two-run single in the fifth
and the first of McLemore's two RBI singles finished Rekar. The
right-hander allowed four runs and seven hits in 5 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt good and just hit a wall about the sixth,'' Rekar said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Castilla's sixth homer, Tomko allowed singles to
Jose Guillen in the first and Felix Martinez in the fifth. Mariners
manager Lou Piniella pulled Tomko in the sixth after the
right-hander walked Steve Cox and hit Guillen to open the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsay walked the only batter he faced to load the bases with no
outs. Bubba Trammell's sacrifice fly trimmed Tampa Bay's deficit to
4-2 and another run scored when Castilla grounded into a force
play.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners clung to their 4-3 lead when John Flaherty doubled
but Castilla, trying to score from first base, was thrown out at
the plate on Alex Rodriguez's relay throw from left fielder Stan
Javier.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Castilla's homer struck one of the catwalks supporting the
roof at Tropicana Field. He's the sixth player to hit a fair ball
off one of the structures this season ... LF Greg Vaughn, who left
Friday night's game with a strained right hamstring, did not play
and is still listed as day-to-day. ... Cox's throwing error in the
fifth was the first error charged to Tampa Bay's outfield this
season.

<P>
	   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. (AP) -- The state's failure to install a
median barrier makes it entirely liable for a 1994 accident that
killed three people, a judge has ruled.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision made public this week, Court of Claims Judge
Andrew P. O'Rourke said the condition of Route 9 following a rain
storm in October of 1994 led to a head-on collision near an area
underpass.
</P>
<P>
   A southbound car driven by Scott Johnson of the city of
Poughkeepsie skidded into the northbound lane after striking a pool
of water in the southbound lane. Johnson's car collided head-on
with a car driven by Clifford Bogen of Pawling.
</P>
<P>
   Killed in the accident were two passengers in Johnson's car --
7-year-old Sophia Geanes and her legal guardian, Debra Royal, 31,
both city of Poughkeepsie residents -- and a passenger in the
northbound car, Mary Bogen, 35, of Pawling. Johnson, Clifford Bogen
and five others were injured in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Town of Poughkeepsie Detective Roger Kroll testified that he had
expressed concern to state Department of Transportation engineers
about the drainage problems on the highway following a fatal
accident at the same location in 1989. Kroll, then a patrol
officer, investigated the crash.
</P>
<P>
   A median barrier was installed in 1995, several months after the
1994 accident.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, O'Rourke said the state should have installed the
barrier sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Damage awards will be determined at an upcoming trial.

<HEADLINE> IOC Dossier Investigated  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL FOY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Salt Lake bid executives Tom Welch and
Dave Johnson tagged the names of loyal supporters with the word
''geld'' -- the German word for money -- in a dossier of
International Olympic Committee members.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson's attorney, Max Wheeler, insisted Saturday that the
term was never meant to imply IOC members' votes for Salt Lake's
2002 Winter Olympics bid could be bought with cash.
</P>
<P>
   Geld also means gold in Flemish, the language Johnson used as a
young Mormon missionary in Belgium, and was his term for potential
converts then.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a term that was used in the mission field to mean
'golden' -- somebody who was on your side or receptive to your
message,'' Wheeler said.
</P>
<P>
   Welch provided a similar account.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nothing,'' he said, translating geld as ''golden
contacts.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Geld'' appears in a gossipy Salt Lake memo next to the names
of eight IOC members -- including five implicated last year for
accepting cash, gifts, scholarships and other inducements from the
Salt Lake bid committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody ever approached me with money and I never received a
red cent,'' Jamaican IOC member Tony Bridge said Saturday from his
home in Kingston.
</P>
<P>
   Welch recalled Bridge as a ''great statesman'' and respected IOC
member worthy of the geld label. He was one of two IOC members not
previously associated with the scandal who were marked as geld in
the 28-page memo.
</P>
<P>
   The other was Francis Nyangwesco of Uganda, whose name appeared
next to the notes: ''son 17 needs a future, equipment, geld.''
</P>
<P>
   The bid committee regularly awarded money for sports equipment
in foreign countries, although the SLOC ethics panel reported that
little of the money ostensibly relayed to national Olympic
committees made it into the hands of athletes or impoverished
youths.
</P>
<P>
   Bidders used the geld file to keep track of the personal quirks,
loyalties and family needs of IOC members. Johnson is believed to
have maintained the list in a computer file, jotting notes he
gleaned about IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   The memo was retrieved under a subpoena in the U.S. Justice
Department's grand jury investigation of the Olympics scandal. The
Salt Lake Organizing Committee released it Friday, a day after the
Justice Department said it wouldn't prosecute the organization.
</P>
<P>
   The cryptic memo covered the significant and the trivial, from
details about Salt Lake's most influential supporters, IOC
president Juan Antonio Samaranch and Swiss member Marc Hodler, to
South Korean member Kim Un-yong's fondness for chocolate chip
cookies.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Kims loved Mrs. Fields cookies,'' Welch said, referring to
the Salt Lake-based company.
</P>
<P>
   The memo does not mention the word ''bribe'' or inventory
gift-giving. It consists of two lists, one sparse and the other
containing more details on IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   The only clue to the memo's authorship is a heading for First
Security Corp. on one page. The bank's chairman and CEO, Spencer
Eccles, still serves on the board of trustees of the organizing
committee.
</P>
<P>
   First Security ''had nothing to do with the memo,'' Eccles'
attorney, Rodney Snow, said Saturday. He could not explain why the
bank's name appeared on a page.
</P>
<P>
   Snow and Eccles were shown part of the geld memo when the
Olympic trustee was interviewed by Justice Department, but Snow
said he never saw any mention of First Security on those papers.
</P>
<P>
   Eccles, who also appeared before the federal grand jury, is a
cooperating witness in the Olympic probe, Snow said.

<HEADLINE> United 3, Burn 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Raul Diaz Arce returned to a hero's welcome as
D.C. United ended a record-tying four-game losing streak with a 3-2
victory over the Dallas Burn on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas lost its third straight game when defender Brandon
Pollard's own goal in the 74th minute broke a 2-2 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard, sliding in front of the Burn goal, inadvertently
knocked Ben Olsen's shot from the left side of the penalty area
past goalie Matt Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Albright and Carlos Llamosa scored for D.C., which had
dropped three straight games at RFK Stadium. United's only other
four-game losing streak came at the start of the inaugural MLS
season in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kreis scored twice for the Burn, who fell to 0-6-0 on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz Arce, who scored 38 goals in 50 regular-season games for
United from 1996-97, was acquired Friday from Tampa Bay for John
Maessner and three future draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   D.C., which traded Diaz Arce to New England on Feb. 5, 1998, to
get under the salary cap, reacquired Diaz Arce to boost a sagging
offense that had scored only two goals during the four-game skid.
</P>
<P>
   The second-leading scorer in MLS history, Diaz Arce drew loud
cheers and encouraging whistles from the rain-drenched crowd of
18,120 every time he touched the ball. However, he was closely
marked by the Burn defense and recorded only a second-half shot.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's first career goal, a header off Marco Etcheverry's
long, looping free kick from the right side, staked United to a 1-0
lead in the 11th minute. Kreis tied it about two minutes later,
bouncing a low shot from 35 yards out through a maze of players and
inside the right post.
</P>
<P>
   Llamosa restored the D.C. lead in the 22nd minute, directing a
header past Jordan from the middle of the penalty area. But Kreis
put a right-footed shot past United goalie Tom Presthus from 12
yards out in the 47th minute for a 2-2 tie.

<HEADLINE> Cars Explode After Train Derails  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUNICE, La. (AP) -- Freight cars loaded with hazardous chemicals
exploded and caught fire after a Union Pacific freight train
derailed Saturday, sending fireballs into the sky and forcing the
evacuation of thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported. About 3,500 people were ordered to
evacuate homes and business up to 2{ miles from the wreck because
soot fell on neighborhoods beyond the first evacuation area, state
Trooper E.J. Chesne said. The fire after the derailment set nearby
woods ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looked like those pictures of the atomic bomb, a mushroom
cloud,'' said Ruth White, a retired teacher who said she heard at
least four explosions. ''I grabbed my medicine. That's all I got.''
</P>
<P>
   About 350 people had been ordered from within a mile of the
accident when the evacuation was broadened.
</P>
<P>
   Union Pacific had rented 40 hotel rooms for evacuees at a Best
Western motel two miles from the wreck. ''But now they're
evacuating us, too,'' Patty Deculus (DEC'-yoo-lus), a desk clerk
there, said.
</P>
<P>
   State police Sgt. Richard Hazelwood said 29 cars derailed and at
least 10 caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   The blast shattered windows up to a quarter-mile away. An
explosion nearly two hours after the initial derailment sent a
fireball 150 to 200 feet into the air, said Peter Piazza, a
newspaper photographer who witnessed the fireball.
</P>
<P>
   Flames appeared to rise 50 to 70 feet from other burning cars
and there appeared to be flames as far as a mile down the track,
said Piazza, who viewed the derailment from a helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Chesne said the worst chemicals in the wreckage were methyl
chloride, acrylic acid, toluene diisocyanate, and dichloropropane.
</P>
<P>
   Methyl chloride is used to make silicones, agricultural
chemicals, methyl cellulose, and butyl rubber.
</P>
<P>
   Large amounts can cause convulsions, coma, and death. Lower
amounts can cause staggering, blurred or double vision, dizziness,
and fatigue, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Toluene diisocyanate is flammable and can irritate the lungs,
skin and eyes when touched or inhaled. It is used to coat tinted
glass.
</P>
<P>
   Dichloropropane can cause shortness of breath, coughs and chest
discomfort, and can make the linings of the eyelid bleed. It is
widely used to make carbon tetrachloride, and also as an oil and
fat solvent in certain furniture finishes, dry cleaning fluids, and
paint removers.
</P>
<P>
   Acrylic acid is a clear liquid with a sharp odor. Breathing its

when it derailed shortly before noon in Eunice, 77 miles west of

<HEADLINE> Serb Opposition Urges Disobedience  </HEADLINE>
By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbia's opposition leaders urged
their followers on Saturday to use civil disobedience against
President Slobodan Milosevic's rule, hoping that a well-organized,
peaceful struggle might oust the autocrat.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a rally in the capital, Belgrade, before some 15,000
supporters, the head of the Democratic Party, Zoran Djindjic, said
his opposition party and others will come out this week with
detailed plans to counter police repression and the government's
crackdown on pro-democracy forces.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will organize defense against the criminals who want to
kill us all ... everyone who is attacked will try to defend
himself, his neighbors and friends will help, his town will defend
him, the whole nation will help.'' Djindjic said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the question remains whether the opposition can muster
enough support for such a well-organized campaign. Opposition
rallies, which a few years ago sometimes attracted hundreds of
thousands, now are attended only by a fraction of those numbers of
demonstrators, reflecting general dissatisfaction with the
ineffectiveness of opposition leaders, weakened by years of
squabbling.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the government shut down the main pro-opposition
television station, triggering street protests that triggered
street fights between police and opposition supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''If police try to take over (another) local television station,
the whole town will declare civil disobedience ... it's not an
uprising, it's a struggle for elementary human rights.'' Djindjic
said.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition also reiterated their demands for fair elections,
the release of political prisoners and end to ''state terror''
against opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, a daily newspaper based in Montenegro, the
smaller Yugoslav republic, published what it said was a classified
document signed by a top army general ordering his troops on a
higher alert to counter any threat, domestic or foreign, against
the Yugoslav government.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Milorad Obradovic reportedly ordered the army's Second
Corps to watch out for ''foreign enemies, (which) together with
certain opposition forces ... are conducting propaganda with the
aim to topple the legally elected authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   The army declined immediate comment on the report which also
urged ''resolute action'' against any ''forces that might
jeopardize security... military facilities, the communications
system and command structure'' of the army.

<HEADLINE> Suspect in Wendy's shootings a fugitive free on $3,500 bail  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A man arrested in the quintuple massacre at
Wendy's was a fugitive free on $3,500 bail after a string of armed
robberies at fast-food restaurants, law-enforcement officials said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had requested a bail of $100,000 for John ''Benji''
Taylor, but the judge released him last summer ''on a ridiculously
low bail,'' said Sherry Hunter, a spokeswoman for the Queens
district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old suspect and an alleged accomplice are scheduled
to be arraigned Sunday for killing five Wendy's employees and
wounding two others. Their heads wrapped in plastic, they were
bound, gagged and shot execution-style.
</P>
<P>
   It was the most gruesome crime on a trail that stretches back to
the summer of 1996, when Taylor was assistant manager of a
McDonald's on Fifth Avenue near the Empire State Building. He was
found guilty of trying to break into the restaurant's safe and was
sentenced to five years' probation.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the course of a week last June, he was linked to
robberies or attempted robberies at four fast-food businesses in
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to law enforcement officials in Queens said
Taylor admitted his guilt in two of the robberies on June 19 and
June 23, and prosecutors were negotiating a 12-year sentence last
August when he raised the $3,500 bail money set by Judge Pauline
Mullings.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gov. George Pataki said Pataki has proposed
legislation that would give prosecutors the right to appeal low
bail for a suspect like Taylor. The bill passed the Senate earlier
this week, and is up for a vote in the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Had this legislation been in place, this animal potentially
would have been behind bars, rather than on the street,'' said the
spokesman, Michael McKeon.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor failed to appear in court on Oct. 22 and again on Nov. 5.
Authorities issued a warrant for him, but he had been a fugitive
since.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was arrested Friday afternoon at his mother's house in
Brentwood, Long Island, about 30 miles from the scene of
Wednesday's killings at the Wendy's in Flushing, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   His ex-girlfriend had given police his cell phone number, which
they used to track his whereabouts, said an investigator close to
the case, speaking on condition of anonymity. NYPD detectives then
staked out the house in Suffolk County.
</P>
<P>
   Officers responding to a bicycle accident in front of the home
picked up the heavy-set, 5-foot-5 suspect as he stood outside
watching the commotion, said First Deputy Police Commissioner
Patrick Kelleher.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had a weapon in a fanny pack that was in his possession, a
.380-caliber semiautomatic,'' Kelleher said. The same caliber
weapon was used in the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Ballistics tests showed Taylor's gun was used to kill at least
one of the employees, said Detective Joseph Pentangelo, a police
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The other suspect, Craig Godineaux, 31, was arrested at a men's
clothing store where both suspects worked. Each admitted to a role
in Wednesday's murder-robbery, Kelleher said.
</P>
<P>
   In the basement, police lifted Taylor's palm print from a box
found in a blood-spattered, walk-in refrigerator where he and
Godineaux allegedly corralled the seven workers before shooting
them.
</P>
<P>
   Stolen from the restaurant was $2,400, along with a surveillance
tape of the entrance to Wendy's that shows the two men entering and
eating. Later, the tape shows Taylor going downstairs, followed by
the employees and Godineaux, said the police investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the suspects' statements, police believe Taylor killed
the manager and Godineaux shot the other victims in an effort to
silence any witnesses, the investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, reportedly the father of two sons and a daughter, worked
at the Flushing Wendy's briefly in 1999. He left in October under
suspicion because money was missing. He was never charged.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was dismissed for theft,'' said Kelleher. ''We believe he
did have a beef with the manager. Whether that was what led him to
the shooting, we don't know yet.''
</P>
<P>
   At their arraignment in Queens Criminal Court, both men face
multiple counts of first- and second-degree murder, robbery and
weapons charges, said Queens District Attorney Richard Brown. He
could seek the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had hoped to hold the arraignment on Saturday. But
they held off because they needed more time to put their case
together, Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   The five workers killed in the shooting were identified as Ramon
Nazario, 44, of Queens; Anita C. Smith, 23, of Queens; Jeremy Ryan
Mele, 18, of Neptune, N.J.; Ali Ibadat, 40, of Queens; and Jean
Auguste, 27, of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Auguste, a Haitian immigrant, was the manager and the gunmen
asked for him by name when they came to the restaurant around
closing time, just after 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Castro, 23, was shot through both cheeks and played
dead, then freed himself two hours later and called 911. He was
released from the hospital Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The other survivor, JaQuione Johnson, 18, underwent brain
surgery for a gunshot wound to the head and remained in critical
condition Saturday at New York Hospital Medical Center in Queens.

<HEADLINE> Twins 10, Rangers 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Corey Koskie hit a bases-loaded triple, and
Butch Huskey added a two-run double as the Minnesota Twins beat the
Texas Rangers 10-5 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins, who lost all 12 games to Texas last season, have won
four of the five games played between the two teams this year.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Mays (2-6) won for the first time since May 3, and Midre
Cummings and Cristian Guzman homered for Minnesota, which picked up
its 12th comeback victory of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Mateo hit a two-run homer and David Segui had three RBIs
for the Rangers, who fell to 2-3 on their current nine-game
roadtrip.
</P>
<P>
   Mays allowed five runs -- four earned -- and six hits in 6 2-3
innings. The right-hander struck out three and walked four.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 4-1, Minnesota scored four runs off Mark Clark (3-3) in
the fourth to take the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Coomer led off with a single. After two walks loaded the
bases, Koskie tripled to center. Matthew LeCroy singled in Koskie
to make it 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Huskey hit a two-run double off Clark in the fifth to make it
7-4.
</P>
<P>
   Clark allowed seven runs and seven hits in 4 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Segui's RBI double off Travis Miller in the seventh made it 7-5.
Denny Hocking hit a sacrifice fly off Mike Venafro in the bottom of
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman hit a two-run shot off Jeff Zimmerman in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Texas scored three runs in the third inning to break a 1-1 tie
on Segui's RBI double and Mateo's seventh homer of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers scored an unearned run in the first without getting
a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Curtis reached on Huskey's error at first before Mays
issued consecutive walks to Rodriguez, Rafael Palmeiro and Segui.
</P>
<P>
   Mays got out of the jam when he struck out Mateo and got Mike
Lamb to fly out to left.
</P>
<P>
   Texas wasted a leadoff triple by Royce Clayton in the second and
Minnesota tied the game in the bottom of the inning on Cummings'
second homer of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, the Rangers activated outfielder Rusty Greer
from the 15-day disabled list. Greer, who had been out since April
13 with a pulled left hamstring, hit a pinch-hit double in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, Mays was hit in his left hand by a foul
ball, while he was sitting in the dugout. He immediately went to
the hospital for X-rays and the injury was diagnosed as a deep
bruise.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Minnesota begins a nine-game roadtrip on Tuesday with three
games each at Toronto, Cincinnati and Houston. ... The Twins have
been shut out in three of Mays' 11 starts. ... Mays issued two
bases-loaded walks in the first inning of his last start. ... Greer
remained in Texas when the Rangers left for their current roadtrip
to be with his wife Lauri, who delivered twins, a boy and a girl,
on Tuesday night. ... RHP Danny Kolb was optioned to Oklahoma of
the Pacific Coast League to make room for Greer. ... Mateo is
0-for-7 this season with the bases loaded. ... The Rangers have
lost by five runs or more for the second straight night and fifth
time this season. Minnesota won the opener 10-2.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Opposition Casts Blame  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's opposition parties blamed
the country's election council for problems that led to this
weekend's vote being canceled and demanded its members resign.
</P>
<P>
   The demands came two days after The Supreme Tribunal of Justice
-- Venezuela's highest court -- suspended presidential, congressional
and regional elections set for Sunday, citing glitches in the
electronic balloting system that made it impossible to hold the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   But opposition leaders said Saturday that the council charged
with running the vote should resign.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition, church and military leaders have questioned the
fairness of the balloting because the election council was
hand-picked by President Hugo Chavez's political coalition. They
allege that council members knew about technical glitches but
failed to disclose them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I prefer to say a lie, and not deception,'' Attorney General
Javier Elechiguerra said in Saturday's editions of the major daily
El Universal.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's court decision, however, gives Chavez's main
challenger, a former state governor named Francisco Arias Cardenas,
more time to try to reduce the president's 15- to 20-point lead in
the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Albornoz, a spokesman for Fatherland For All -- one of the
political parities that recently split from Chavez -- said he
believed the election council had ''lost all credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Omar Mezza, a spokesman for Chavez's party, the Fifth Republic
Movement, denied that the government wanted to avoid selecting a
new electoral council, but said it would prefer not delaying the
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Miquilena, head of the congress, said Saturday that no
final decisions had been made about how to proceed with the
election quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   Arias, meanwhile, echoed the demand for members of the election
council to be removed from their posts. He said a new election date
could not be fixed until a new council is picked.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, former U.S. President Carter, who was in Venezuela
with a team of international election observers, said the vote will
eliminate the influence Chavez exercises over the congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a temporary situation that will be changed as a result
of the election,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Devils Heading to Stanley Cup Final  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- It was almost impossible not to
notice the Prince Of Wales Trophy sitting on a receptionist's desk
in the New Jersey Devils' offices Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It's about 3 feet high and 2 feet wide. It's given to the
Eastern Conference champion after they earn the right to play in
the Stanley Cup final.
</P>
<P>
   Just the fact it was in Devils' offices at all says a lot about
this team.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, the Devils were being written off after losing a
third straight game to the Philadelphia Flyers to fall behind 3-1
in the best-of-seven series. The Devils played so poorly in that
fourth game that coach Larry Robinson went into a garbage
can-kicking tirade and challenged his players to do what they do
best -- play smart, defensive hockey.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils answered that challenge over the last three games of
the series. They held the Flyers to one goal in each game, winning
Game 7 by a 2-1 score Friday night on a late goal by Patrik Elias.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's good to take a step back and feel good about the players
and coaches and all the adversity that they had to overcome,
especially with the external pressure that was put on this team,''
general manager Lou Lamoriello said Saturday. ''Everyone pointed to
the past, but this was a different team with different players.''
</P>
<P>
   The past that Lamoriello alluded to was the Devils' playoff
history. Since winning their only Stanley Cup in 1995, the team has
not gotten past the second round, losing in the opening round the
last two years.
</P>
<P>
   That's all behind them now.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing beats going to the finals,'' Devils center Bobby Holik
said. ''Nothing! But we're not satisfied. That's because the real
playoffs start now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils will open the finals Tuesday night at Continental
Airlines Arena against defending champion Dallas. The Stars beat
Colorado 3-2 on Saturday night in Game 7 of the Western Conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars will have to beat a physical team that is led by
defenseman and captain Scott Stevens. He has dominated the playoffs
with big hits on Pavel Bure of Florida, Tomas Kaberle and Kevyn
Adams of Toronto and his biggest of all, a crushing blow to Eric
Lindros in Game 7 that sent him to the sidelines in the first
period with yet another head injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a heck of a feat we accomplished,'' Stevens said after
the Devils became the first team from win a conference final after
falling behind 3-1. ''We made history tonight. I told the guys we'd
have a great bus ride home.''
</P>
<P>
   And on top of the receptionist's desk, there was a visible
reminder of what the Devils had done.

Two killed in separate collisions north of Albany
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Two people died Saturday afternoon in
separate collisions on the Northway.
</P>
<P>
   Police say 45-year-old Roy Sieg of Johnstown, Fulton County, was
changing lanes on his Harley Davidson motorcycle but traveled too
far to the left and struck a guard rail about 2:15 p.m. He was
thrown from the bike and pronounced dead at the scene near Exit 23,
by Lake George.
</P>
<P>
   The other collision, which took place near Exit 9 in southern
Saratoga County, killed one person and seriously injured two more.
Authorities say a southbound car driven by 28-year-old Michael
Anthony Olszowy crossed over into northbound traffic about 2:30
p.m., splitting in half as it struck and rolled one vehicle, then
continuing on to hit a second vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Olszowy, of Troy, was pronounced dead of internal trauma at
Albany Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Motorists Margaret Michele, 33, of Bridgeport, Conn. and Guildor

<HEADLINE> White Sox 14, Indians 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Jose Valentin drove in a career-high six runs and
fell a single shy of becoming the first AL player to hit for the
cycle twice in one season, leading the Chicago White Sox over the
Cleveland Indians 14-3 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin hit a two-run homer in the first inning, a bases-loaded
triple in the second and an RBI double in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox, who led 14-0 after seven innings, opened a
2{-game lead over the Indians in the AL Central. Cleveland manager
Charlie Manuel held a pregame meeting, then saw his team lose for
the fourth time in five games.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Lee homered and drove in three runs, Frank Thomas hit a
pair of RBI doubles and Magglio Ordonez drove in two runs with two
singles for Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 30,250, second-largest this season at Comiskey
Park, gave Valentin a standing ovation when he came to bat in the
fifth and booed when Mark Watson walked him.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin, who hit for the cycle on April 27 against Baltimore,
grounded out in the seventh. He was left on deck when Ray Durham
bounced into an inning-ending double play in the eighth -- Durham
was barely thrown out, marking just the third time he's grounded
into a DP this season.
</P>
<P>
   Babe Herman is the only player to hit for the cycle twice in a
year, doing it for Brooklyn in 1931.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Parque (4-2) gave up two runs and six hits in 7 1-3 innings
for his first win since April 27. The left-hander, who was 0-1 in
his last five starts, departed after serving up Roberto Alomar's
two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Jaret Wright (3-3), activated from the disabled list before the
game, was hit hard.
</P>
<P>
   Wright had been sidelined since his last start May 11 with a
strained muscle in his right shoulder. He gave up seven runs on six
hits and one walk in 1 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Durham singled to lead off the White Sox first and Valentin
followed with his seventh home run.
</P>
<P>
   With the bases loaded in the Chicago second, Valentin tripled
down the right-field line to make it 5-0. Thomas doubled to score
Valentin and chase Wright. One out later, Chris Singleton singled
off Sean DePaula to make it 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Ramirez had three hits for the Indians.
Notes: Valentin's previous career-best for RBIs was five. He did
it last month when he hit for the cycle, and also April 3, 1998, at
Florida. ... Brothers Bryan and Grady Little, coaches for the White
Sox and Indians, respectively, exchanged lineup cards at home plate
before the game. ... Cleveland has homered in 18 straight games to
tie a club record.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Rebels Reject Offer  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Armed rebels holding Fiji's former prime
minister and about 30 others hostage in parliament rejected on
Sunday the latest offer by the country's president: a new
government and immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara said he had fired the
democratically elected government of Prime Minister Mahendra
Chaudhry, who has been held captive by an armed gang for 10 days
inside the parliament compound.
</P>
<P>
   But rebel leader George Speight insisted Mara must resign and
Fiji's 1997 constitution, which indigenous Fijians blame for giving
too much power to the nation's ethnic Indian minority, must be
scrapped before the hostages are freed.
</P>
<P>
   The offer was ''the act of a desperate man,'' Speight said.
''His agenda is clear -- he was trying to do everything in his power
to retain power in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he expected a new offer within two days that could lead
to the freeing of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Mara's announcement on Saturday came several hours after two
soldiers and a journalist were injured in a gun battle outside
Parliament between rebels and Fijian soldiers. The president said
the timing was unrelated.
</P>
<P>
   Mara, a figurehead who normally holds little government power,
said he would appoint a caretaker administration by Monday, and
would continue to rule the Pacific nation until then through
state-of-emergency powers.
</P>
<P>
   The president also said it was ''highly likely'' that rebel
leader George Speight and the six gunmen who stormed parliament on
May 19 would be granted immunity from prosecution for their roles
in the coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
   But Mara did not accept the rebels' third demand -- that he
resign as president.
</P>
<P>
   Mara acknowledged it would look like he was caving in, but said
that he had no choice and that his plan was the last hope for a
''constitutionally viable route'' to end the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted that if the plan is accepted, Fiji would become an
international pariah. Main trading partner Australia as well as New
Zealand, the United States and the United Nations have condemned
any deal that replaces the elected government as giving in to
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign nations have threatened to impose economic and
diplomatic sanctions. Mara warned that Fiji's main industries of
sugarcane growing and tourism would collapse under sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to face not only purgatory, but hell,'' Mara
said.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry, who was elected prime minister last year, is the
country's first leader of Indian ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   Speight claims to be acting on behalf of the majority indigenous
Fijians, and wants to reduce the powers that Indians can have in
the government. He has declared himself prime minister and
appointed his own cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   The gun battle Saturday began after some 200 rebel supporters
and at least three armed rebels left the parliament compound. On
the way out, one said: ''We're going to take down the roadblocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Confronting about eight soldiers at a roadblock 400 yards from
the compound, the supporters tried to grab the soldiers' weapons
and pushed one of them to the ground. The other soldiers fired
warning shots. Rebels shot back, setting off a gun battle that
lasted for less than five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers withdrew and were chased by the rebels and their
supporters, who threw rocks and carried machetes. The mob
eventually returned to parliament, marching, singing a song and
carrying army tents they had pulled down.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said one soldier was hit in the shoulder and the other
in the leg. Jerry Harmer, 38, of Britain, a senior producer and
cameraman for Associated Press Television News, was shot in the
right wrist. Doctors at Suva's Colonial War Memorial hospital said
his condition was good.
</P>
<P>
   Speight did not appear to be involved in the confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Army commander Commodore Frank Bainimarama said his soldiers
could not stop the armed rebels because they were using unarmed
supporters as human shields.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji, which had two bloodless coups in 1987, is an island nation
in the Pacific 2,250 miles northeast of Sydney, Australia. Fijians
of Indian ancestry make up 44 percent of the population of 813,000,
while indigenous Fijians account for 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Indians own many shops and businesses in Fiji. Some
ethnic Indians have been attacked since Speight's coup began.

<HEADLINE> Train Derailment Causes Explosion  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUNICE, La. (AP) -- Freight cars loaded with hazardous chemicals
exploded and caught fire after a Union Pacific freight train
derailed Saturday, sending fireballs into the sky and forcing the
evacuation of thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported. About 3,500 people were ordered to
evacuate homes and business up to 2{ miles from the wreck because
soot fell on neighborhoods beyond the first evacuation area, state
Trooper E.J. Chesne said. The fire after the derailment set nearby
woods ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looked like those pictures of the atomic bomb, a mushroom
cloud,'' said Ruth White, a retired teacher who said she heard at
least four explosions. ''I grabbed my medicine. That's all I got.''
</P>
<P>
   About 350 people had been ordered from within a mile of the
accident when the evacuation was broadened.
</P>
<P>
   Union Pacific had rented 40 hotel rooms for evacuees at a Best
Western motel two miles from the wreck. ''But now they're
evacuating us, too,'' Patty Deculus (DEC'-yoo-lus), a desk clerk
there, said.
</P>
<P>
   State police Sgt. Richard Hazelwood said 29 cars derailed and at
least 10 caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   The blast shattered windows up to a quarter-mile away. An
explosion nearly two hours after the initial derailment sent a
fireball 150 to 200 feet into the air, said Peter Piazza, a
newspaper photographer who witnessed the fireball.
</P>
<P>
   Flames appeared to rise 50 to 70 feet from other burning cars
and there appeared to be flames as far as a mile down the track,
said Piazza, who viewed the derailment from a helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board dispatched a
four-member investigative team to the derailment.
</P>
<P>
   Chesne said the worst chemicals in the wreckage were methyl
chloride, acrylic acid, toluene diisocyanate, and dichloropropane.
</P>
<P>
   Methyl chloride is used to make silicones, agricultural
chemicals, methyl cellulose, and butyl rubber.
</P>
<P>
   Large amounts can cause convulsions, coma, and death. Lower
amounts can cause staggering, blurred or double vision, dizziness,
and fatigue, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Toluene diisocyanate is flammable and can irritate the lungs,
skin and eyes when touched or inhaled. It is used to coat tinted
glass.
</P>
<P>
   Dichloropropane can cause shortness of breath, coughs and chest
discomfort, and can make the linings of the eyelid bleed. It is
widely used to make carbon tetrachloride, and also as an oil and
fat solvent in certain furniture finishes, dry cleaning fluids, and
paint removers.
</P>
<P>
   Acrylic acid is a clear liquid with a sharp odor. Breathing its
vapors irritates the lungs, nose and throat.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Davis, regional spokesman for the railroad in Omaha, Neb.,
said the train was heading from Freeport, Texas, to Livonia, La.,
when it derailed shortly before noon in Eunice, 77 miles west of
Baton Rouge.

<HEADLINE> Wendy's Suspect Was a Fugitive  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A man arrested in the execution slayings of five
people at a Wendy's was a fugitive free on $3,500 bail after a
string of armed robberies at fast-food restaurants, authorities
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had requested a bail of $100,000 for John ''Benji''
Taylor, but the judge released him last summer ''on a ridiculously
low bail,'' said Sherry Hunter, a spokeswoman for the Queens
district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old suspect and an alleged accomplice were to be
arraigned Sunday for killing five Wendy's employees and wounding
two others. Their heads wrapped in plastic, they were bound, gagged
and shot execution-style.
</P>
<P>
   It was the most gruesome crime on a trail that authorities say
stretches back to the summer of 1996, when Taylor was assistant
manager of a McDonald's near the Empire State Building. He was
found guilty of trying to break into the restaurant's safe and was
sentenced to five years' probation.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the course of a week last June, he was linked to
robberies or attempted robberies at four fast-food businesses in
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to law enforcement officials who spoke on
condition of anonymity said Taylor admitted his guilt in robberies
on June 19 and June 23, and prosecutors were negotiating a 12-year
sentence last August. He then raised the $3,500 bail set by Judge
Pauline Mullings.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor failed to appear in court on Oct. 22 and again on Nov. 5.
Authorities issued a warrant for him and he had been a fugitive
since.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gov. George Pataki said Pataki has proposed
legislation that would give prosecutors the right to appeal low
bail for a suspect like Taylor. The bill passed the Senate earlier
this week, and is up for a vote in the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Had this legislation been in place, this animal potentially
would have been behind bars, rather than on the street,'' said the
spokesman, Michael McKeon.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was arrested Friday afternoon at his mother's house in
Brentwood, N.Y., about 30 miles from the scene of Wednesday's
killings in Flushing, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had a weapon in a fanny pack that was in his possession, a
.380-caliber semiautomatic,'' First Deputy Police Commissioner
Patrick Kelleher said. Ballistics tests showed Taylor's gun was
used to kill at least one of the employees, said Detective Joseph
Pentangelo, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The other suspect, Craig Godineaux, 31, was arrested at a men's
clothing store where both suspects worked. Each admitted to a role
in Wednesday's murder-robbery, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor worked at the Flushing Wendy's briefly in 1999. He left
in October under suspicion because money was missing. He was never
charged.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was dismissed for theft,'' Kelleher said. ''We believe he
did have a beef with the manager. Whether that was what led him to
the shooting, we don't know yet.''
</P>
<P>
   At their arraignment, both men faced multiple counts of first-
and second-degree murder, robbery and weapons charges, said Queens
District Attorney Richard Brown. He could seek the death penalty.

<HEADLINE> MetroStars 4, Chicago 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Steve Jolley and Clint Mathis
scored goals a minute apart late in the first half as the New
York-New Jersey MetroStars beat the Chicago Fire 4-1 Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 41,609 attended the game at the Meadowlands, the
largest for an MLS game this season.
</P>
<P>
   Jolley scored in the 34th minute and Mathis in the 35th to help
the MetroStars score three goals in a half for the first time since
a win over Chicago in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Chung's fourth-minute goal gave the MetroStars a 1-0 lead.
The Fire, who had won three of their last four, outshot the
MetroStars 14-5 in the first 45 minutes, but MetroStars goalkeeper
Mike Ammann made several tough saves.
</P>
<P>
   Ante Razov scored on a penalty shot in the 71st minute for
Chicago, his league-leading 11th goal. Razov was awarded the shot
after he was tripped by Daniel Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars closed out the scoring five minutes later on a
penalty shot by Adolfo Valencia, who had been pulled down by
defender C.J. Brown.

<HEADLINE> Rangers' Greer Activated From DL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The Texas Rangers activated outfielder Rusty
Greer from the 15-day disabled list on Saturday before their game
against the Minnesota Twins.
</P>
<P>
   Greer, who had been on the disabled list since April 13 with a
pulled left hamstring, hit a pinch-hit double in the ninth inning
of Texas' 10-5 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't stepped on the field in six weeks so it feels good
to be on the field regardless,'' Greer said.
</P>
<P>
   Greer also underwent surgery for bone spurs on his right ankle
on April 16 and had shoulder soreness during his rehab assignment
last week in Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just a matter of going out and not trying to do too much,
not trying to play catch-up with everybody else,'' Greer added.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates said that he is ready to reinstate Greer in
the starting lineup for Sunday's game at the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not 100 percent, but he's getting there,'' Oates said.
''He's ready to start in left field tomorrow. He swung the bat
pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer remained in Texas when the Rangers left for their current
road trip to be with his wife Lauri, who delivered twins, a boy and
a girl, on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   He was batting .240 (6-for-25) with a homer and five RBIs in
seven games for the Rangers, before the injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers optioned right-hander Danny Kolb to Triple-A
Oklahoma to make room for Greer. Kolb allowed five runs in
two-thirds of an inning Friday night against Minnesota in his only
outing.

Thousands Evacuated After Train Derails

Ulster Unionists Endorse Joint Government

   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Northern Ireland's major Protestant party
voted Saturday to revive a joint government with Catholics, but the party's
leader warned the coalition would survive only if the Irish Republican Army
disarms. The province's power-sharing government began operating in December,
ending 27 years of direct rule by Britain, but it was suspended 11 weeks later
because the IRA refused to make any disarmament commitments. The IRA broke the
impasse three weeks ago, promising to disarm if power-sharing resumed. Sinn Fein
President Gerry Adams, speaking in New York, called the vote the ''right

security.'' Bush last week proposed reducing the U.S. nuclear stockpile to its
''lowest possible number consistent with our national security,'' even without
Russia making cuts. The Texas governor paired the cuts with a broad national
security review that must include a missile defense system. He also opposes a
treaty that bans worldwide tests of nuclear weapons.

general said that he improperly accepted gifts while in public office. Weizman
has informed Prime Minister Ehud Barak of his decision, the aide, Arieh Shumer,
said. Weizman, 76, has said he will resign sometime this year, citing ill health
and the implications of a police investigation into over $300,000 in gifts that
he took from French millionaire Edouard Sarousi between 1988 and 1993, while he
was a legislator and Cabinet minister. The president says the money was a
personal gift.

   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- The United States is certain Pakistan could
persuade neighboring Afghanistan to hand over suspected terrorist Osama bin
Laden, a top U.S. diplomat said Saturday. Washington believes Pakistan's
continued support for Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia means it could play
''a very constructive role in bringing Osama bin Laden to justice,'' said U.S.
Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering, speaking in Islamabad. Bin Laden is
suspected of masterminding the twin U.S. Embassy bombings in East Africa in
1998. Bin Laden, who is on the U.S. 10 Most Wanted List, is living in
Afghanistan protected by the Taliban.

   MONTREAL (AP) -- Maurice ''The Rocket'' Richard, one of the greatest scorers
in NHL history, died today at the age of 78. The former Montreal Canadiens star
had slipped into a deep coma overnight. He was hospitalized with a recurrence of
stomach cancer that was first diagnosed more than two years ago. Richard also
had Parkinson's disease, and his agent said doctors also suspected the onset of
Alzheimer's disease. Richard was the cornerstone of the Canadiens' dynasty that
won five straight Stanley Cups and eight in his 18 seasons in the NHL.

<HEADLINE> Quotes on Maurice 'Rocket' Richard  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''We all wanted to wear (his) No. 9 when we were kids -- not just
me. This man played a role in my career through the pride he
displayed each time he wore the sweater of the Montreal
Canadiens.'' -- former Canadiens star Guy Lafleur.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was one of the best players who ever played in the history
of hockey. He was a man who had a lot of respect in the hockey
world.'' -- former Penguins star Mario Lemieux.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a theory: Whenever he scored a goal the cheer at the
Forum was just a decibel higher than when anybody else scored, no
matter the importance.'' -- hockey broadcaster Dick Irvin Jr., whose
father coached Richard.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was an icon in Montreal, in Quebec. People just worshipped
him, so did we all,'' former teammate Dickie Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had a solid will to win and was a tireless worker. Skilled
and determined, he was in all respects an indispensable teammate
but also a formidable opponent.'' -- Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard.
</P>
<P>
   ''There wasn't a dry eye in the house when he received a
standing ovation at the closing of the Montreal Forum (in 1996). It
was extremely moving; I almost fell to the ground, my knees were
trembling so hard.'' -- Ronald Corey, former president of the
Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   ''With his pride, his passion, his drive and his determination,
Maurice Richard embodied all the qualities that make hockey
great.'' -- NHL commissioner Gary Bettman.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'd walk into a room and it was like a king walked in. I live
in Three Rivers and the people in Quebec, they loved him, they
absolutely loved the guy. He was great guy.'' -- broadcaster and
former NHL coach Don Cherry.
</P>
<P>
   ''What truly set him apart -- what made him a special hero to the
fans -- was his extraordinary intensity. He played with great
emotion and flair and possessed an unmatched will to win. His
dazzling combination of skill and drive not only made him one of
the greatest hockey players ever, it also made him a symbol to all
of what it takes to be a true champion.'' -- Canadian Prime Minister
Jean Chretien.
</P>
<P>
   ''As soon as he would touch the puck, you could feel the
electricity in the crowd. It was amazing to see how people would
react -- not only in Montreal, but everywhere he played. There's
never been another like him.'' -- former linemate Bernie ''Boom''
Geoffrion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Richard ... was much more than a hockey player. He was the
first NHL player to score 50 goals in a 50-game season among his
544 in 978 regular-season games. He was the most intense athlete
this game, this city, this province, this country ever has seen. He
was everything that personified greatness. It was in this place --
the Montreal Forum -- he was to become an icon, a legend. He was, in
every way, one of a kind.'' -- Red Fisher of the Montreal Gazette.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rocket had that mean look on, every game we played. He was 100
percent hockey. He could hate with the best of them. But with all
respect, he set the standard to chase, and that was the scoring and
also his total ability. ... He was a tremendous influence in the
league and for the French population of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ''He could rile up the Montreal fans in a hurry. God, sometimes
I felt sorry for the man. He must have got a standing ovation when
he went shopping.'' -- former Detroit star Gordie Howe.

Two killed in separate collisions north of Albany
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Two people died Saturday afternoon in
separate collisions on the Northway.
</P>
<P>
   Police say 45-year-old Roy Sieg of Johnstown, Fulton County, was
changing lanes on his Harley Davidson motorcycle but traveled too
far to the left and struck a guard rail about 2:15 p.m. He was
thrown from the bike and pronounced dead at the scene near Exit 23,
by Lake George.
</P>
<P>
   The other collision, which took place near Exit 9 in southern
Saratoga County about 2:50 p.m., killed one person and seriously
injured two more. Authorities say a southbound car driven by
28-year-old Michael Anthony Olszowy crossed the median and became
airborne, splitting in half as it struck and rolled a northbound
vehicle. Olszowy's vehicle then continued on to hit a second
northbound vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Olszowy, of Troy, was pronounced dead of internal trauma at
Albany Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Motorists Margaret Michele, 33, of Bridgeport, Conn. and Guildor
Joseph Lebel, 55, of Ballston Lake in Saratoga County were in
serious condition at Albany Medical Center.

<HEADLINE> Athletics 4, Orioles 0  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Tim Hudson allowed one hit over 7 1-3 innings
for his fifth straight victory as Oakland defeated Baltimore 4-0
Saturday night, ending the Orioles' four-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   The lone hit off Hudson was a fifth-inning single by Will Clark.
The sinking liner to center popped out of the glove of a diving
Terrence Long, who was prone as he attempted to make a sensational
catch.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson (6-2) walked four and struck out five. He was lifted
after issuing a one-out walk to Greg Myers in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Tam immediately gave up a single to Mike Bordick and walked
Delino DeShields to load the bases with two outs before striking
out B.J. Surhoff. Tam completed the two-hitter with a perfect
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson, a 6-foot right-hander, allowed only two balls out of the
infield and permitted only one runner past second base in improving
to 5-0 over his last six starts.
</P>
<P>
   He retired the first 13 batters before walking Harold Baines in
the fifth. A walk to Cal Ripken and Clark's single loaded the bases
before Myers ended the threat by bouncing into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson threw 112 pitches. It was only the second time in 47
games this season that the Orioles failed to get an extra-base hit.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hargrove was ejected for the first time as manager of the
Orioles in the fifth inning for arguing the call of a pitch by home
plate umpire Alfonso Marquez.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland took a 2-0 lead in the first inning on a two-out,
two-run double by Olmedo Saenz, subbing for the injured Jeremy
Giambi (sprained thumb) at first base.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Chavez ended a 4-for-29 skid with a two-out triple in the
Oakland fourth and Jason Johnson (0-3) issued two straight walks
before Frank Menechino was retired on a fly ball.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, starting for the first time in two weeks, allowed two
runs and eight hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland made it 4-0 in the eighth when Miguel Tejada doubled in
a run and scored on a single by Ramon Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Orioles C Charles Johnson, hit in the groin by a foul ball
Friday, was sore still Saturday but hoped to play Sunday or Monday.
... Oakland 2B Randy Velarde was excused for the weekend to attend
his daughter's high school graduation in Texas. ... Oakland
improved its AL-best road record to 15-9. ... It was the second
shutout against Baltimore and the second by the A's this season.

Canadiens' dynasty that won five straight Stanley Cups, died
Saturday at the age of 78.
</P>
<P>
   Richard, who slipped into a deep coma overnight, died of
respiratory failure after a long battle with abdominal cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The hockey great was hospitalized with a recurrence of the
cancer that was first diagnosed more than two years ago. He also
had Parkinson's disease, and doctors suspected the onset of
Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   Richard, No. 62 on The Associated Press list of the top 100
athletes of the 20th century, helped the Canadiens win eight
Stanley Cups during his 18-year career.
</P>
<P>
   ''What truly set him apart -- what made him a special hero to the
fans -- was his extraordinary intensity,'' Prime Minister Jean
Chretien said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''He played with great emotion and flair and possessed an
unmatched will to win. His dazzling combination of skill and drive
not only made him one of the greatest hockey players ever, it also
made him a symbol to all of what it takes to be a true champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard and the Canadiens were followed with religious zeal in
Montreal, with his fiery temper and the fans' dedication to their
hero leading to a 1955 riot outside the Montreal Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ''He loved hockey, the Canadiens and the fans,'' said Jean
Beliveau, the former Montreal captain who disclosed last week that
he has a malignant tumor in his neck.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a great leader. He didn't talk much. He preferred to
express himself on the ice. I would tell younger players to watch
the fire emanating from his eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard finished his career with a then-record 544 goals. He was
the first player to score 500 goals and the first to score 50 goals
in a season when he did it in 50 games in 1944-45. His six overtime
goals remains a playoff record.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rocket had that mean look on, every game we played,'' Hall of
Famer Gordie Howe said. ''He was 100 percent hockey. He could hate
with the best of them.
</P>
<P>
   ''He could rile up the Montreal fans in a hurry. God, sometimes
I felt sorry for the man. He must have got a standing ovation when
he went shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of Montreal radio and television stations switched to
all-Richard programming upon learning of his death.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're ready to share our grief with the public,'' Maurice
Richard Jr. said outside Hotel Dieu Hospital. ''We know what our
father meant.''
</P>
<P>
   Andre Robidoux, a doctor who treated Richard, said the former
player was on medication and did not suffer in his final days.
</P>
<P>
   ''He died of respiratory failure, which was caused by several
factors,'' Robidoux said. ''We did all we could to save him over
the week and throughout his illness.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard was ambidextrous, a right wing who shot left-handed. He
often switched from backhand to forehand as he swooped in on
goalies. In the days before curved blades and slap shots, the
Rocket possessed a hard, accurate shot and he was one of hockey's
most dangerous scorers.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I remember most about the Rocket were his eyes,'' Hall of
Fame goalie Glenn Hall once said. ''When he came flying toward you
with the puck on his stick, his eyes were all lit up, flashing and
gleaming like a pinball machine. It was terrifying.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard had great strength and shrugged off checks. He sometimes
carried defensemen with him as he zoomed in on goalies.
</P>
<P>
   ''With his pride, his passion, his drive, and his determination,
Maurice Richard embodied all the qualities that make hockey
great,'' NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said. ''He will live on
through his legend and his legacy of excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Montreal on Aug. 4, 1921, Richard grew up in a rough
part of the city, next to a jail. He played hockey in the city's
park league but his early career was often interrupted by injuries.
There was a broken ankle, then a broken wrist. When he was promoted
to the Canadiens in 1942, Richard broke his ankle again and the
team's general manager, Tommy Gorman, said ''It looks like we have
a brittle-boned player on our hands.'' Gorman even considered
releasing Richard.
</P>
<P>
   But as he matured, Richard shook off that image and became one
of the most compelling figures in the six-team league through the
1940s and '50s.
</P>
<P>
   On March 13, 1955, Richard got into a brawl with Boston's Hal
Laycoe, swinging his stick at the defenseman three times and then
taking a punch at linesman Cliff Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   NHL president Clarence Campbell suspended Richard for the final
three games of the regular season and the entire playoffs. Then,
four days after handing down his ruling, Campbell appeared at the
Forum for a crucial game against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   He was greeted by boos and a shower of peanuts and programs.
Then a fan approached Campbell as if to shake his hand and slugged
him instead. A tear gas bomb exploded on the ice and the game was
forfeited to the Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   When the fans spilled out of the Forum on to Ste. Catherine
Street, in the middle of downtown Montreal, stores were looted and
the crowd started a full scale riot.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Richard went on the radio to plead for calm. ''I
will take my punishment,'' he said, ''and come back next year to
help the club and the younger players to win the Stanley Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's exactly what he did.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, with Richard back, the Canadiens began an
unmatched run of five straight championships. Nine months after he
retired in 1960, Richard was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame,
which waived its usual five-year waiting period to honor him.
</P>
<P>
   He often drew double coverage on the ice but he skated right
through it, bowling defenders over and then staring them down with
his dark, menacing eyes. The Rocket's Red Glare could dissect
defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ''As soon as he would touch the puck, you could feel the
electricity in the crowd,'' said former linemate Bernie ''Boom
Boom'' Geoffrion. ''It was amazing to see how people would react.
There's never been another like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard led the league in goals five times and was part of the
most devastating power play in hockey history, one which forced a
change in the rules. Before the Richard-led Canadiens mastered the
manpower advantage, penalized teams were forced to play shorthanded
for the full term of the penalty. But the Canadiens became so
proficient with the extra skater that they often scored two and
three times, causing the rule to be changed and limiting power
plays to a single goal.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were games when I felt everything I shot would go in,''
Richard said. ''On some nights, if I touched the puck, I knew I
would score.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were supposed to win all the time. When we did not win, it
was a tragedy to many fans. All they knew was win, win, win.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard and wife Lucille, who died in 1994, had seven children
and 14 grandchildren. Richard's brother, Henri, also played for the
Canadiens.

<HEADLINE> Peers honor 'Peanuts' creator Schulz  </HEADLINE>
By LUKAS I. ALPERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The rest of the world knew him, rather formally,
as Charles M. Schulz. But to his many friends, the late creator of
Charlie Brown and Snoopy was simply ''Sparky.''
</P>
<P>
   Those friends, many of them fellow cartoonists, celebrated
Sparky's 50 years in the funnies business Saturday evening by
running Schulz-themed cartoons in the nation's newspapers. More
than 80 strips paid homage to ''Peanuts'' -- everything from ''Alley
Oop'' to ''Ziggy.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, 600 members of the National Cartoonists
Society and guests honored Schulz posthumously with The Milton
Caniff Lifetime Achievement Award. His widow, Jeannie, accepted the
organization's highest honor during the black-tie event.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sparky had hoped for all of his life that he would receive
this award and had hoped he would be here for it, and in many ways,
I think he is,'' she said to a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick McDonald, who created the cartoon called ''Mutts,''
presented the award to Schulz's wife.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's get the record straight right now,'' McDonald said.
''Charles Schulz was the greatest cartoonist who ever lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Bil Keane, the master of ceremonies, who created ''Family
Circus,'' added, ''This was a small tribute to an icon we all
consider a dear friend for decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Mort Walker, who created ''Beetle Bailey,'' paid tribute to
Schulz in his Saturday cartoon, which showed Beetle, Gen. Halftrack
and Sgt. Snorkel saluting a blimp with Snoopy on its side.
</P>
<P>
   ''We salute you, Snoopy and Sparky,'' it read. ''We'll miss you,
old friend.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saturday coordination of cartoons was organized by Pulitzer
Prize-winning artist Mike Luckovich of The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution. It was timed to coincide with the Caniff
Award for Schulz, who died Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought this would be a fun way for cartoonists to
personally honor and thank Sparky,'' Luckovich said. ''This tribute
is a celebration of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Peanuts'' made its official debut on Oct. 2, 1950. The daily
tales of the ''little round-headed kid'' and his pals eventually
ran in more than 2,600 newspapers, reaching millions of readers in
75 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz won the Reuben Award, comic art's highest honor, in 1955
and 1964. In 1978, he was named International Cartoonist of the
Year, an award voted by 700 comic artists around the world.

<HEADLINE> School Mourns Popular Fla. Teacher  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Scores of grieving children,
parents and colleagues brought flowers and notes Saturday to the
middle school where a popular English teacher was fatally shot on
the last day of classes.
</P>
<P>
   In a courtroom across town, a judge ordered that 13-year-old
Nathaniel Brazill remain in custody while a grand jury considers
what charges should be brought against him in Barry Grunow's death.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney Barry Krischer, known to back zero tolerance
attitudes in dealing with juvenile crime, said he decided to charge
the teen-ager as an adult, the Miami Herald reported in its Sunday
editions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It shouldn't be so easy for juveniles to get a gun,'' Krischer
told the newspaper, ''just because they have no impulse control.''
</P>
<P>
   The seventh-grader had been sent home by an assistant principal
Friday around 1 p.m. for throwing water balloons in class.
According to police, he rode his bicycle back to school about two
hours later with a semi-automatic pistol in his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   The pistol -- a compact, 5-inch model called a Raven -- was loaded
with four bullets he had stolen from his grandfather's dresser
drawer a week before, Police Chief William Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Brazill was trying to talk to two girls in Grunow's class. When
the teacher told him to leave, police say, he pulled out the gun
and shot Grunow in the head. Grunow, 35, was the father of two and
had worked at the school for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Police say the boy rode away on his bicycle, but flagged down a
police officer about a quarter of a mile from the school and
surrendered. He told investigators he liked Grunow.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody's talking about the gun, but we need to try to
figure out what made him do that,'' said Corey Jackson, a pastor
and neighbor of Brazill's.
</P>
<P>
   Early Saturday, Brazill, wearing a two-piece khaki jail uniform,
his wrists shackled, appeared before Palm Beach County Circuit
Court Judge Jorge LaBarga and a courtroom packed with cameras and
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   His parents were distraught, but the boy's expression was
obstructed from view. He was flanked by two public defenders, who
said they are still working on how to best represent their client.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is too premature, we need to spend more time with our
client,'' said lawyer Damon Amedeo.
</P>
<P>
   Brazill is being held at the Palm Beach Regional Juvenile
Detention Center in West Palm Beach. The grand jury has to review
the case by June 17.
</P>
<P>
   Curtains were drawn Saturday at the home of Brazill's parents.
</P>
<P>
   An elderly man answered the door and said the family was not yet
ready to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as I know, he was real good,'' said Jackson, Brazill's
neighbor. ''They were supposed to go to church with us last night.
We're still in shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside Lake Worth Middle School, a memorial of flowers and
posters covered a 40-foot section of the school's fence. Parents
and children hugged, cried and tried to console one another.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the messages were addressed to ''Shaggy,'' a nickname
given to Grunow because of his hair.
</P>
<P>
   Students, parents and school officials said he was well-liked
and known for unconventional methods, like reading J.R.R. Tolkien's
''The Hobbit'' aloud in class with different voices for the
characters. Students said he regularly joined them in pickup
basketball games after school.
</P>
<P>
   At least 200 people stopped at the school Saturday to speak with
grief counselors, who also planned to be there Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know how my children are taking this, and I just don't have
the answers,'' said Beverly Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Her 12-year-old daughter Amber should have been in Grunow's
class, but her mother asked her to stay home. It's a practice Hart
has followed the past few years with all her children on the last
day of classes out of concern that kids are likely to bring weapons
or fight, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though she was absent, Hart came home to find Amber
''shaking from head to toe hysterically on the couch'' Friday after
finding out about the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a great man. I always enjoyed it when my kids were
going to be in his classes,'' said Hart. ''Every way you look at
it, it's a tragedy. It's scary.''
