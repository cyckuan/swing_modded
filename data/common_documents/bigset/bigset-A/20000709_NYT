TEXAN IS HOPEFUL FOR OPEN SPOT ON U.S. CYCLING TEAM

   Five past Olympians spice the U.S. roster, but the fate of
Frisco, Texas, resident Jeff Labauve remained in doubt as USA
Cycling announced its track roster last week.
</P>
<P>
   Medal winners Marty Nothstein of Trexlertown, Pa., and Erin
Hartwell of Indianapolis, Ind., head the list of former Olympians
to make the team.
</P>
<P>
   Nothstein won a silver medal in the match sprint event at the
1996 Atlanta Olympics, while Hartwell earned a bronze at the '92
Games and a silver in '96 in the kilometer time trial.
</P>
<P>
   The top performers at the U.S. Olympic Trials for Track Cycling
at the Frisco Superdrome in May were named to the U.S. Long Team
and competed in World Cup events during the past six weeks. The
final announcement of the Olympic team _ 11 men and three women _
came Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Making the women's team was two-time Olympic speed skating medal
winner Chris Witty of Park City, Utah. She will attempt to become
only the second U.S. athlete to medal in both the summer and winter
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Joining her on the women's team are Tanya Lindenmuth of
Trexlertown and Erin Veenstra-Mirabella of Colorado Springs, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The final men's sprint position remains open and will be
determined no later than Aug. 1. USA Cycling officials _ and
sprinter Labauve _ are awaiting the fate of veteran Johnny Bairos
of Redlands, Calif., who suffered a horrific crash at a World Cup
event three weeks ago in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Bairos was competing in a match sprint race and riding outside
of three other cyclists when he was forced up and over the track.
According to eyewitnesses, he fell more than 20 feet and landed
face-first, 30 feet away from the velodrome.
</P>
<P>
   Bairos, 22, fractured his jaw in two places, broke his right
kneecap, severely bruised his right thigh and suffered fractures in
his right and left sinus cavities. He has had to undergo two
surgeries since the accident.
</P>
<P>
   USA Cycling officials remain hopeful that Bairos can recover and
compete in the Sydney Games. If he can't, Labauve is expected to
replace him on the U.S. squad. nn

MULHOLLAND'S BEST OUTING FOLLOWS WORST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He came into Saturday's game ranked fifth in the National League
in fewest walks per nine innings (1.9), making Terry Mulholland his
own tough act to follow.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Mulholland exited, he had 1.9-upped himself, not
issuing a walk in eight innings in earning his second win against
the Red Sox this season.
</P>
<P>
   It was a far cry from his last start.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday in Atlanta, he absorbed one of the worst
shellackings of a major league career that began 14 years ago in
San Francisco. The lefthander was touched for 10 hits and nine runs
by Montreal in a 17-1 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, though, he survived some early scares and he didn't
hurt himself with the free pass. All seven Boston base runners had
to earn their own way on against Mulholland, who finished with a
flourish, retiring the last eight batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a pitcher who started the game with a 6.06 ERA.
Opponents were batting .324 against him. He had given up a
career-high 13 hits three times this season and now he had to face
a team that had decimated Minnesota pitching earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I definitely went out and used my entire repertoire
today,'' said Mulholland, who improved his record to 9-8 while
lowering his ERA to 5.71. ``It's not an easy task to pitch to that
lineup over there and I was very effective in using both halves of
the plate. I was primarily going away with my sinker and then
working the guys in with cutters and curveballs down. It was a
matter of mixing it up enough to where they didn't get comfortable
looking for one pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was a moment in the Boston fourth when Mulholland was
bending and about ready to break.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Frye and Carl Everett had grounded singles to left and
Nomar Garciaparra, who had doubled off Mulholland in the second,
was up. Garciaparra went after the first pitch, sending a grounder
to third baseman Chipper Jones, who turned it into a 5-3 double
play.
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland got out of the inning by striking out Morgan
Burkhart. After Troy O'Leary singled to open the fifth, Mulholland
promptly picked him off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The double play was very big and Chipper made a great play,''
he said. ``That was a big lift for me because there was a good
chance it was going to be a big inning for them and I may not have
been around after that.''
</P>
<P>
   The pickoff? ``When the ball came back to the infield, I was
walking back to the mound and (O'Leary) had already taken his lead
prior to me getting on the rubber, so I thought maybe I can catch
him a little flat-footed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That sequence helped hold the Red Sox at bay in what was to
become, according to Braves manager Bobby Cox, ``The best game
Terry's pitched all season.''
</P>
<P>
   But the manager also felt that his starter was ``gassed'' after
eight innings of work, so it was John Rocker time with the four-run
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have gone back out for the ninth,'' said Mulholland,
``but we needed to get a couple of guys right in the bullpen and it
was a good situation for Rock to come in and start the inning.''
</P>
<P>
   After Mulholland's 4 1/3 forgetful innings against Montreal,
pitching coach Leo Mazzone had a few things on his mind he didn't
want Mulholland to forget, specifically his tempo and pitch
selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry moves fast as it is,'' said Mazzone, ``but sometimes you
can move too fast and get ahead of yourself. Terry quieted
everything down today, from start to finish.''
</P>
<P>
   And quieted some Red Sox bats in the process.

CRAWFORD SENT BACK TO PAWTUCKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three days ago, Paxton Crawford gleefully flew out of Minnesota
with a prized trophy in his pocket: the game ball from his first
Red Sox victory.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Crawford was hauling a sadder payload _ all his
belongings back to Pawtucket.
</P>
<P>
   In a roster move certain to rile anxious Sox fans, manager Jimy
Williams informed the promising rookie it was time to go.
</P>
<P>
   Despite several shaky outings recently by Boston's regular
starters, there is no room for Crawford, who left town with an ERA
of 2.19 in his two starts since he was summoned from Pawtucket July
1 to replace the injured Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our roster,'' Williams said. ``He came up for Pedro,
and Pedro is coming off'' the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, Martinez does not come off the disabled list until
Thursday. For a day, at least, Crawford's demotion could allow the
Red Sox to recall lefthanded reliever Sang-Hoon Lee, who struck out
the side for Pawtucket Friday in relief of former Boston starter
Brian Rose. The Sox temporarily depleted their bullpen by using two
lefthanded relievers in Saturday's 5-1 loss to the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   For at least one rotation after the All-Star break, Williams
indicated he will stick with his regular starters and said the
demotion will allow Crawford to start Thursday for Pawtucket.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, 22, the epitome of a hard-throwing, easygoing country
pitcher, took the news in stride. ``I'm not worried about it or mad
at anybody or nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's outing, Crawford clinched Boston's four-game sweep
of Minnesota by outdueling the Twins' $36 million ace Brad Radke,
allowing one run on six hits and no walks in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford pitched well enough to win his big-league debut July 1
against Chicago, yielding only two earned runs in 5 1/3 innings.
However, he took the loss amid a series of misplays by his former
Pawtucket teammate, Izzy Alcantara, which helped the White Sox
score four unearned runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid did fine,'' Williams said of Crawford's two outings.
``But we only have so many players with options. We have these
other pitchers who are starting after the break and he has continue
to start, too,'' in Pawtucket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a young kid,'' Crawford said, ``and they've got some
veterans on the team who deserve to pitch. They have worked so hard
and so long for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams seemed resigned to some criticism of Crawford's
demotion. ``We can only do things one step at a time, just one step
at a time,'' he said. ``You folks might have other ideas, but we
have to do things the way we think is the proper way to do them at
this moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford received the news in a closed-door meeting with
Williams and pitching coach Joe Kerrigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if they were going to tell me I was staying or
going,'' he said. ``But I was ready either way. I don't think my
heart rate even went up a beat. I'm getting kind of used to this
all-of-a-sudden-something-happens stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated before his makeshift locker, Crawford said, ``I'm not
going to worry about the money or the bigger paycheck. It's nice,
but as long as I have a uniform on and as long as I pitch, I'm not
worried about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was the relocation to address. ``I've got to pack
up my stuff, throw it in my truck, and go again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the packing would be a cinch. ``I still have three plastic
trunks in my truck full of clothes,'' he said. ``I never really had
time to unpack here.''

SECOND EFFORT IS SOX' PRIORITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With only one game left before the All-Star break it comes down
to this: The Red Sox need to work harder than ever to remain a
contender in the American League East. They are slipping fast and
need to turn it around . . . or else.
</P>
<P>
   After a four-game sweep at Minnesota, the Sox have regressed.  &UR;  &LR; 
With Saturday's 5-1 loss to the Atlanta Braves at Fenway, their
second straight defeat, Boston is just a game over .500 (42-41) and
19-19 at home. Last year, the Sox were 13 games above .500 (47-34)
at the All-Star break and locked into second place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing we have to do is go out there and battle our way
through the tough times,'' said catcher Jason Varitek. ``Right now,
guys are struggling. We have to find a way to do some things, get
more into ballgames, create new pitches, and throw more pitches.
You can't sit back and wait for people. We have to find a way to
get it done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to put it all together for a long stretch. We haven't
been able to do that just yet. That time is going to come. But you
know, there are a lot of guys putting in a lot of work, trying to
better themselves and better the team.''
</P>
<P>
   There were a lot of sad faces in the clubhouse, but none were
making excuses. Twelve players, including ace Pedro Martinez, are
on the disabled list, and that is understood. But it still hurts to
sweep Minnesota by scoring a ton of runs, and then get slammed by
the Braves, who are surviving their own pennant race against the
Mets and seem primed for a return to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we played in Minnesota was a nice way to play,'' said
Varitek. ``But not just because we scored a lot of runs. That was a
series in which we were able to go about our business. We have to
keep that attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems on the field have had a lot to do with the
injuries. Minus Trot Nixon and Darren Lewis, the outfield won't be
mistaken for a Gold Glove trio, not with Jeff Frye and Brian
Daubach plugging the holes. Ed Sprague has yet to pay dividends at
third base. Pedro may not be completely healthy for the rest of the
season, and Bret Saberhagen has yet to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   World Series talk has slowed since early May, the last time
Boston won a home series (White Sox, May 8-10). Interleague play
hasn't helped at all _ the Sox are just 3-8 against National League
foes after Saturday's setback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's not from lack of effort,'' said manager Jimy
Williams. ``We just couldn't score (Saturday). We had some guys up
in the right situations and it just didn't work. (The Braves) made
some pitches when they had to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox try to salvage the series finale Sunday against Greg
Maddux. But even a win may not be enough to brighten the postseason
outlook. Jeff Fassero needs to recover from his dead arm. Somebody,
perhaps Bernard Gilkey, needs to fill Nixon's shoes if the right
fielder's absence is prolonged.
</P>
<P>
   One thing we do know is that the second half is going to hinge
on the Martinez brothers, and both seem more than up to the
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second half we should do better,'' said Ramon, who was
saddled with the loss Saturday despite allowing just two earned
runs in six innings. ``Like today, I knew that if I kept it close
we had a chance to score some runs and we didn't. That happens.''

SOX DROP SECOND TO BRAVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's probably not a problem Jimy Williams will point out to John
Harrington between the CEO's trips to City Hall and the State
House.
</P>
<P>
   By now, it is commonly understood that Williams is the type of
guy who would sooner chew off his own arm than complain to his boss
about anything.
</P>
<P>
   But this idea of playing the Atlanta Braves just before the
All-Star break has got to go.
</P>
<P>
   Things to do before taking a three-day vacation:
</P>
<P>
   1) Turn down the AC.
</P>
<P>
   2) Water the plants.
</P>
<P>
   3) Face Greg Maddux, the four-time Cy Young Award winner, after
having already lost back-to-back games at Fenway Park to lefthanded
starters (Tom Glavine and Terry Mulholland) for the first time
since April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we faced Maddux last year just before the break,
too,'' Sox catcher Jason Varitek said after the Sox fell, 5-1, to
the 37-year-old Mulholland and the defending National League champs
before 33,311 dismayed patrons on Yawkey Way.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely. Mulholland's performance Saturday (8 innings, 1 run,
7 hits, 0 walks) came on the heels of Friday's 5-3 win by Glavine,
the local lad who showed no mercy on his former heroes. It also
foreshadows Sunday afternoon's scheduled performance by Maddux, who
will be attempting to send the Sox to their fourth series sweep
this season and third consecutive weekend of having their heads
handed to them.
</P>
<P>
   Last July in Atlanta, on the Sunday afternoon just before
baseball went on holiday, Maddux and the Braves whipped the Sox,
8-1, sending them to their fifth loss in six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we'll get lucky and beat him this time,'' Varitek said
sarcastically.
</P>
<P>
   It's bad enough the Sox may be stuck with the Braves as their
interleague partner in perpetuity. Except for those Boston Braves
diehards who still carry faded Sibby Sisti baseball cards in their
battered wallets, most folks in Boston would just as soon see Team
Turner beating up somebody else on cable than the Olde Towne Team
in the Fens.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves and Sox have met 17 times since interleague play
began in 1997. So far, it's Braves 12, Sox 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like playing against them,'' Varitek insisted. ``I enjoy
playing the good teams. There isn't anybody here who doesn't enjoy
playing the good teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the innocence of youth. A more world-weary view was offered
by Sox lefthander Jeff Fassero, who came out of the bullpen for the
first time this season and had reason to wish he'd never popped his
head out. In the eighth, an inning after reliever Bryce Florie
walked Chipper Jones with the bases loaded to break a 1-1 tie,
Fassero gave up a two-run home run to Javy Lopez, the Braves
catcher who was swinging one-handed, to make it 4-1, then
surrendered Andruw Jones's 23d home run in the ninth for Atlanta's
final run.
</P>
<P>
   Both were Fenway Park specials, fly balls that carried over the
left-field wall, but that was of little consolation to Fassero, who
with Randy Johnson in Seattle in 1997 formed the last pair of
lefthanders to beat the Sox here in consecutive starts. It did
nothing for Ramon Martinez, either, whose record is now 6-5 even
though he held the Braves at bay for six innings-plus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fastballs were outs, the two forkballs were home runs,''
Fassero said. ``The Green Monster giveth, and the Green Monster
taketh away. Take away a foot, and those balls are singles. In a
bigger ballpark, those are two fly balls.''
</P>
<P>
   But beyond that, Fassero observed, is this misguided notion that
the Sox and Braves were meant for each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why we should have to play them six
times,'' Fassero said, dismissing the historical context as a
reason to manufacture a rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't Philadelphia be our rivals or Montreal our rivals?
The Braves have been the best team in the '90s. Why should we play
them? Playing a team three times or six times doesn't make a
rivalry. The teams in our division are our rivals.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, of course, Atlanta isn't the only team that has made
the Sox look overmatched. The Sox are 3-8 in interleague play, and
they're now a .500 team at home (19-19), where they haven't won a
series since taking two out of three from the White Sox May 8-10.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves came into the weekend with the worst earned run
average in the National League for the first week of July (5.81),
but recovered nicely against the Sox. Especially Mulholland, last
seen on the losing end of a 17-1 game against the Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, hits allowed by a pitcher can be a misleading stat.
David Wells began play having allowed more hits than any pitcher in
the American League (140, a phat total by anyone's calculation),
but the Blue Jays' don't-call-me-portly lefthander leads the majors
in wins with 14.
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland, meanwhile, began play with a yield of 145 hits, most
by any pitcher in the majors. Yet, for the second time this season,
he proved unfathomable to Sox hitters, who three times had two hits
in an inning but scored only once.
</P>
<P>
   When Mulholland faced the Red Sox in Atlanta last June 10, he
threw five scoreless innings in a 6-0 romp in Turner Field before
coming out with a strained groin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a good cutter, and he hides the ball pretty well,''
Varitek said. ``And tonight, he got ahead of all the hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sunday afternoon, Maddux is likely to offer more of the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be here,'' Williams said. ``We'll definitely show up
tomorrow.''

BRAVES EYE STRONG FINISH BEFORE BREAK

<P>
   The Braves, no matter what they were doing, had only one eye on
their task. Those eating had the one eye on their food but the
other on the television. Those dressing had one eye on the sock on
their foot and the other on the Mets-Yankees game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we go, here we go, here we go . . . we got action!'' a
Brave shouted as the Mets' Mike Piazza was conked in the head by a
pitch from the Yankees' Roger Clemens. ``We got serious action!''
The Braves locker room at Fenway Park quickly grew louder.
</P>
<P>
   Braves catcher Javy Lopez also had one eye on the TV as he
explained how he had hit his home run off the Red Sox' Jeff Fassero
in the eighth inning more or less one-handed, adding insult to the
injury of Fassero's poor performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to finish strong before the All-Star break,'' Lopez
said just before Clemens threw the pitch that knocked out Piazza.
``Now is the time to do it because now the Yankees are doing the
job for us on the Mets. So I guess this is the opportunity for us
against the Red Sox to get ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Piazza went down, Lopez's eye had caught it all and his
reaction was instant. ``(Clemens) did it on purpose . . . Piazza
hit a home run twice off Clemens . . . that says it all.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves themselves had said it all with their second
consecutive comfortable win over the once-again hitless wonders
that are the Red Sox. The Braves have learned how to treat the
meek: beat them soundly.
</P>
<P>
   And Lopez was in the middle of it all, from calling the pitches
from Terry Mulholland that sent the Sox hitters back into their
pre-Minnesota funk, to his hit leading off the seventh that led to
the Braves' 2-1 lead, to his two-run homer on a 1-2 count in the
eighth that put the game far out of reach. John Rocker ended it all
with a 1-2-3 ninth that saw him go more to his curve ball than his
wild fast ball of Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been getting me with breaking pitches,'' Lopez said
when asked if he was surprised Boston pitchers keep throwing him
breaking balls when he twice beat the Red Sox last year off
breaking pitches. ``It all depends on what I'm looking for on that
particular pitch. Fassero threw me a split-finger and I hit it only
so-so . . . but good enough to hit it out of the ballpark. I ended
up with only one hand on the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Lopez had the one-handed homer and three hits, it was
Chipper Jones's at-bat with the bases loaded and two out in the
seventh of a tie game that quietly accomplished almost as much as
Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   Sox reliever Bryce Florie had just struck out a flailing Andruw
Jones with one out, bringing up Jones. Jones came through a with a
``quality at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Florie from San Diego and he's a hard sinker-slider
guy,'' Jones said. ``He'd gotten me out (Friday night) on a slider
and his bread-and-butter is that hard sinker to get you to hit the
ball on the ground. I was thinking, `You got to make him get the
ball up.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Jones nearly cleared the bases on a first swing against Florie
when his drive down the left field line landed in that spacious 2
feet of foul territory between the line and the left field seats.
Florie got ahead of him, but Jones eventually worked the count to
3-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had put a real good swing on that first ball that I hit down
the left field line and it barely hit foul,'' said Jones. ``So I
felt like I was on it pretty good and, on that 3-2 pitch, he tried
to throw that sinker down. I had to make him get the ball up, and
he never did.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones took the pitch, saying ``you've got to take what God gives
you,'' and ``luckily that sinker fell low of the strike zone. It
was way down, no question.'' Jones walked to first, Lopez trotted
home from third with the go-ahead run and the Braves once again
were taking care of business against the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the first two games of the series is not enough for
these Braves. ``(Sunday) is a big game for us because we don't want
to go into the break on a losing note,'' said Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Especially against the meek of the bat.

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Mike Scioscia didn't apologize exactly for
another home run blitz by the Anaheim Angels, but the manager sure
made it sound that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I keep saying we're more than just a home run team,
the more I'm proven wrong,'' Scioscia said Saturday after the
Angels hammered four more homers in beating Colorado 6-2 in an
interleague game before a crowd of 22,958 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Angels' third win in a row, jumping them five games
above .500 for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Colorado is going the other way. Monday the Rockies
were in first place in the National League West. Since then they've
dropped six in a row, including the last two to the Angels, and
fallen into third place.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a powerful lineup,'' Scioscia said. ``We've been able
to shut them down two games, and that's big.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hill (5-5), who failed to make it out of the second inning
in his last start, this time pitched into the sixth inning, then
turned it over to a bullpen that blanked the Rockies on one hit in
the final 3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Mike Holtz pitched out of a mini-jam in the sixth,
Shigetoshi Hasegawa followed with two solid innings, then Troy
Percival hurled a 1-2-3 ninth, striking out two.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a well-pitched, well-played game,'' said Mo Vaughn, who
slugged one of the Angels' four home runs, a two-run blow in the
first when Anaheim jumped on Colorado's Brian Bohanan (4-6), the
one-time Dodger, for three quick runs.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad slugged Bohanan's second pitch of the game into the
right- field seats for his 17th homer, then Vaughn followed a walk
to Benji Gil with his 23rd. Bengie Molina, appearing as a
designated hitter for the first time in his career - maybe his
grand slam the night before earned him the job - hit his
career-best 11th homer in the fourth when the Angels went on top
5-2. And Garret Anderson, who struck out in his first two at-bats,
hit his 25th in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   It's the ninth time this season the Angels have hit four or more
homers in a game, tying a club record. They've now hit 140,
third-most in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   At the rate they're going, they'll wind up with 261, or 69 more
than the club-record 192 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It's not something Scioscia says he's thinking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll feel much better about this club when we get back to
manufacturing runs,'' said ScioscialIw}:!Q

ON SECOND THOUGHT, ANGELS LINEUP HAS BIG HOLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Finding just the right No. 2 hitter to
complement his power-packed lineup has proved to be a seasonlong
search for Anaheim Angels manager Mike Scioscia, one he concedes he
hasn't completed yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a key spot,'' Scioscia said. ``With Mo (Vaughn), (Tim)
Salmon and (Garret) Anderson coming up right behind, the No. 2 guy
has got to get on base.''
</P>
<P>
   So far Scioscia has employed a half-dozen players in the No. 2
position. For now, he said, he'll stick with Benji Gil against
left-handed pitching and Kevin Stocker against right-handers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go with the matchups until someone steps up in that
spot,'' Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Adam Kennedy was Scioscia's choice to bat second
early on, but it didn't pan out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a young player and, right now, he's better down in the
lineup,'' Scioscia said of Kennedy, who was in what is now his
customary No. 8 spot in the order Saturday. ``He's still got a ways
to go (to bat No. 2).''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was in the No. 2 spot for 49 games, when his average
took a nosedive. But in his past 33 games, mostly hitting eighth,
he's climbed back, from .257 to .284.
</P>
<P>
   Others who have tried the No. 2 spot are Orlando Palmeiro (13
games), Scott Spiezio (5), Keith Luuloa (1), Stocker (10) and Gil
(9), who was 1 for 3 with a walk and a run scored Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Latest streak: The Angels are on their longest winning streak of
the season. Three in a row. For the sixth time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep playing well, it'll work out,'' said Vaughn, when
asked about the Angels' latest momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weve got to keep getting solid starting pitching, not just Ken
(Hill), but all of them, and we've got to keep generating things
offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the horn: Larry Walker, a two-time National League
batting champion and a career .312 hitter, was the Colorado DH on
Saturday and went hitless in four at-bats. That made the Rockies a
dismal 1 for 16 in five games using the DH. ... The Rockies' Mike
Lansing, with two hits Saturday, has 1,000 in his career. ... The
Angels' remarkable Darin Erstad, with a homer and a single, has 46
multi-hit games, most in the majors, and 12 in his past 17 games.
He has 140 hits for the season, most in the majors. He's hit safely
in 72 of the 86 games he's played. ...
</P>
<P>
   Anderson tied teammate Troy Glaus and Leon Wagner (1962) for
most homers by an Angel before the All-Star break (25). ... Bengie
Molina leads all major-league rookies in average (.306) and home
runs (11). ... Kennedy's fourth-inning double snapped an 0-for-9
streak. ... The Rockies, for all their woes - a 17-30 road record,
a season-high six-game losing streak and a first-to-third plunge in
the NL West in less than a week - still are assured of a winning
record at the All-Star break for only the second time in franchise
history (1995 was the other).

SUPPORT OF OWNER, PLAYERS HAS MAVS COACH FEELING YOUNG AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ARTHUR GARCIA 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ For Don Nelson, the desire to return to coaching
paralleled a child's motivation to play with his friends.
</P>
<P>
   Coaching the Dallas Mavericks, like riding bikes, was fun.
Again.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really the biggest reason why I returned,'' Nelson
said. ``I'm having a ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Prodded to return by new Mavericks billionaire owner Mark Cuban,
the team's star players and his own family Nelson, 60, ended his
39-day coaching retirement on May 28.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone could see that Nelson didn't look like a tired,
disinterested coach ready to ride his nest egg into retirement. The
clock suddenly turned back 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm 40 again,'' joked Nelson, who started his run
of seven consecutive division titles with the Milwaukee Bucks two
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's having fun,'' Cuban said. ``That's the message
I've tried to bring to everybody here. You can have fun in this
game. It's a business, but you enjoy going to work, you're going to
do a lot better. I think Nellie is starting to have fun. I can see
it in his eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Nelson, Don's son and his lead assistant coach, credits
Cuban with re-energizing his father, who he simply calls ``Coach.''
To say that Cuban has shaken things up since he bought the team
would be like saying, there's no money in the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing was just sort of perfect for (Cuban) to come in and
just inject us with that special element that we needed,'' Donnie
said. ``Since he's been here, Coach has been a different person.
Part of it is we do have the freedom now to really go and get
things done. We always had the knowledge. We always knew the
angles, but we didn't have the capability.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson took nearly all the blame for the Mavs' often-dismal play
over the past three seasons. The Mavericks were 35-81 in Nelson's
first two years as coach. (He took over for fired coach Jim
Cleamons 16 games into 1997-98 season.)
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks seemed handcuffed by both the bottom-line business
philosophy of the previous ownership and, in the opinion of many,
by Nelson's several questionable personnel moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a few periods in time where it was real
touch-and-go and we didn't know if we were gonna make it,'' Donnie
said. ``That's when Mark came in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Mark was faithful to us in our lowest hour,
we'll never forget that.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire lit under the organization by Cuban didn't burn Nelson
out of town, as was widely speculated. Instead, Nelson, who
appeared to be going through the motions on his way to retirement,
heated up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He appreciates the ideas I've been able to introduce and the
new concepts, and it takes some of the pressure off him,'' Cuban
said. ``For instance, I've been doing a lot of dealing with agents
instead of him and he likes that.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading the bring-back-Nellie charge, were the Mavs' two
cornerstone players, All-Star guard Michael Finely and forward Dirk
Nowitzki. Nelson drafted a virtually unknown Nowitzki ninth overall
in the 1998 draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said I wanted him back,'' said Nowitzki, who finished
second in the voting for the league's Most Improved Player award
last season. ``He's supported me through my whole career and he was
great even when I didn't play that good my first year. He gave me a
lot of minutes, which wasn't normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love him, love his style. He always has something new
and it's just great to play for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavs' record after a dismal start _ 31-19 over the final 50
games, including a 9-1 April _ not only gave fans reason to be
optimistic for the coming season, it acted as time warp into the
1980s for Nelson. Donnie likened his father's mood over the final
three months to his run of seven consecutive division titles with
the Milwaukee Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you win, you have fun,'' Donnie said. ``Coaches are like
players. Winning basketball games is what really our existence is
about as coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said the public support from his players and Cuban made
the decision to come back easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That meant the world to me,'' Nelson said. ``The players were
the No. 1 reason why I came back and Mark was second.'' BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Free-agent hopeful Gheorghe Muresan made his minicamp debut
Saturday at the Tom Landry Center. Assistant coach Donnie Nelson
said the 7-foot-7 center ``looked like the (Muresan) of old. He was
moving pretty good.''

SAMPRAS CAN PROVE HIS GREATNESS TODAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PETE ALFANO 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems only right that Pete Sampras will have to vanquish
Australian Patrick Rafter to make tennis history on Centre Court at
Wimbledon on Sunday. Sampras grew up emulating the Aussie greats of
an earlier era and has spent recent years closing in on what
mightbe the game's most important record _ career Grand Slam titles
_ which he now shares with an Aussie.
</P>
<P>
   A victory against Rafter would give Sampras his seventh
Wimbledon title in as many finals and his 13th Grand Slam title,
moving him ahead of Roy Emerson. It would also spark a new
discussion about whether Sampras is the best player of all time. In
tennis circles the consensus pick is Rod Laver, who Sampras
idolizes, one of two players in the men's game (Don Budge was the
other) to win the Grand Slam _ Wimbledon, French Open, U.S. Open
and Australian Open _ in the same year. Laver did it twice, in 1962
and '69.
</P>
<P>
   It was a great achievement, but remember this: when Laver did it
the first time, tennis was an amateur sport. In '69, the game was
in its professional infancy. Now, the money is big, competition is
tougher and some of the best athletes in the world can be found on
a tennis court. That wasn't the case then.
</P>
<P>
   Also, don't forget that three of the four Slams in Laver's era
were played on grass, with the French on clay. Winning the Grand
Slam now means excelling on grass, clay, and two distinctly
different hard-court surfaces. All that and the fact there are more
specialists in the game _ usually making a living on clay. It's one
of the reasons Sampras hasn't been able to win the French Open.
</P>
<P>
   But Sampras doesn't make excuses. He will not draw any
comparisons between himself and Laver or diminish what Laver
accomplished. Instead, Sampras points out that because Laver turned
professional in the early 1960s before the four Grand Slams allowed
pros to play, he probably cost himself a slew of Slam titles. And
Sampras would not be playing for the Slam record Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   That's typical Sampras, but it doesn't make for good copy. In
today's world, athletes have to talk smack, to have an attitude to
match their game. Even the reserved British crowds that attend
Wimbledon find Sampras boring. During the past two weeks, Sampras'
bid for the record 13th Slam title has been thoroughly overshadowed
by the Williams sisters, as well as the exploits of Andre Agassi,
Mark Philippoussis, Tim Henman, and others.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not as if Sampras has just been sailing along. He is
suffering from tendinitis above his left ankle and almost had to
withdraw during the first week, the pain and disappointment clearly
visible in his expression. Until Saturday, he had not practiced or
warmed up before any of his matches. It couldn't be scripted any
better in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, some his fellow players have suggested that Sampras is
faking, using the injury as psychological warfare or a crutch. If
he says he is injured, it makes him the underdog and lessens the
pressure and expectations. This is not the first time he has done
this, they say. Remember, for instance, how he was doubled over in
pain during a quarterfinal match against Alex Corretja at the U.S.
Open? And inexplicably won?
</P>
<P>
   How about when he collapsed after his first singles match
because of dehydration during the Davis Cup final against Russia
(on clay, no less), and came back to win the doubles and decisive
singles match on the final day. And there was the memorable scene
at the Australian Open when Sampras wept openly during his match
against Jim Courier because his coach Tim Gullikson was sent home
suffering from a cancerous brain tumor. He won that match too.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone who has been around Sampras knows how down-to-earth
and unaffected he is. He hates phonies. While he has maintained a
good relationship with Agassi, for example, he isn't a real big fan
of Agassi's Las Vegas schtSBbSy3u$-qJ3 &Cx1f; e}i &UR; f &UR; 'W4,8o1vU$(R}~`y

TRADING WETTELAND MIGHT LEAVE GAPING HOLE IN RANGERS' BULLPEN

Mr. Wetteland sometimes makes liberal use of the ballpark's warning
track.
</P>
<P>
   So what's your point?
</P>
<P>
   When last we checked, Wetteland stood second in the American
League in successful save opportunities (21). From May 12 to June
5, he was perfect, a club record 13 in a row.
</P>
<P>
   After a ghastly run in April, Wetteland has been the most
consistent arm in manager Johnny Oates' bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Trade him? If the Rangers plan to take the 2001 season
seriously, a more inspired solution might be to re-sign him.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Doug Melvin indicated yesterday that, contrary
to published suggestions, he is not ruling out the possibility that
Wetteland will be back with the Rangers in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   What does Wetteland think, officially?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I need to have an official stance,'' he said
Saturday night, after a deep sigh.
</P>
<P>
   He has a job to do, Wetteland reminded. And that job curtails
fretting about anything beyond the task at hand _ tonight's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want for next month, for next year, is not important,''
was the way Wetteland put it.
</P>
<P>
   He is hard not to like. Yet he can be so perplexing to try to
understand.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland is either the most grounded player in the Rangers
clubhouse _ or the biggest enigma. Much like with his ninth-inning
pitching, a visitor has to peer between the lines.
</P>
<P>
   He is devoutly Christian, and he walks _ and pitches _ the talk.
While Rangers fans squirm and mutter, Wetteland has been known to
stoically scythe his way out of a self-induced bases-loaded jam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I do the job?'' Wetteland asks.
</P>
<P>
   It's as close to a gimme-a-break complaint as you'll get from
Wetteland. His even keel has set an example for the tender young
minds in the Rangers bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of those tender minds, which one exactly do you
propose should take Wetteland's place, provided he is traded before
the July 31 deadline?
</P>
<P>
   Tim Crabtree? Young Francisco Cordero? Jeff Zimmerman?
</P>
<P>
   If Wetteland is dealt away, who's to say that the Rangers won't
head to spring training next February with finding a closer their
No. 1 priority?
</P>
<P>
   Is potential free agent Robb Nen any better? Maybe, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Melvin has some gnawing nights ahead. The
Rangers' recent spate of success might not have dented the Seattle
Mariners' lead as much as prolonged the season's bitter end.
</P>
<P>
   As difficult as it would be to deal away a .340-plus hitter such
as David Segui, Melvin might want to weigh every offer. Segui has
not been a run-producing machine.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, if someone inquires about the fickle arms of Esteban
Loaiza and Darren Oliver, Melvin needs to take the call.
</P>
<P>
   But the Wetteland case is different. A veteran who has seen his
success, who has saved 21 of 25 chances this season, is not readily
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever fate awaits, don't expect Wetteland to campaign one way
or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to avoid being self-serving,'' he said. ``Where I am,
what I'm doing, I leave that to the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Wetteland's wife Michele awaits the birth of their
third child. For the record, the baby is due July 30, the day
before the trade deadline. nn

DODGERS FOLD IN GAGNE'S LATEST COLLAPSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ As the Los Angeles Dodgers head into the final game
before the All-Star break, they're playing like they need a break.
</P>
<P>
   Several players are sick with the flu. Saturday, the whole team
looked sick in suffering its most one-sided loss of the season,
11-0 to the Seattle Mariners before a sellout crowd of 45,248.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good thing the break's coming,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
said. ``We're short-handed as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, only Mark Grudzielanek, F.P. Santangelo and Eric
Karros have the flu, and Todd Hundley's bruised thumb prevents him
from batting right-handed. All but Grudzielanek played Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this was the fifth time this season the Dodgers have been
shut out (June 11 against Oakland was the last) and it erases two
eight-run losses as their widest margin of defeat. Los Angeles
previously lost 15-7 at Arizona on May 8 and 11-3 at Montreal on
April 6.
</P>
<P>
   Starting pitcher Eric Gagne isn't sick, but one day after the
pitching held up in a tight 11-inning victory, Gagne (1-5) got
knocked around for eight runs and seven hits in 3 innings - the
shortest start of his young career.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud provided more than enough punch for Seattle with a
career-high-tying five RBI. He hit a three-run homer off Gagne as
part of a four-run third and doubled in two more off Jamie Arnold
in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gagne's performance that had everyone talking. He's the
one the Dodgers wanted to showcase after waiving Orel Hershiser.
Now, they hope the 24-year-old who has just 17 career starts will
recover and learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just getting too fast and starts reaching back for a lot
more when he should be thinking a little more,'' pitching coach
Claude Osteen said. ``It's not a criticism of him. It's a stage
where he's at. I love his aggressiveness. We all do. But a lot of
times it gets him in trouble because he overthrows.''
</P>
<P>
   Gagne was disappointed because he said he went over the game
plan and knew what to do but didn't execute.
</P>
<P>
   After a 1-2-3 first inning, Gagne was in trouble in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Oliver singled in Olerud for a 1-0 lead, then David Bell's
sacrifice fly in the third made it 2-0. Then Gagne let hang a
changeup that Olerud hit deep to center for a 5-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I got a little (angry) at myself for hanging a
changeup,'' Gagne said. ``I don't know what it was. I didn't
execute the plan. ... Right now, I need to get some people out, and
that's the bottom line. When I get in the game, I try to do too
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle chased Gagne in the fourth as it batted around and
scored four more in the fourth for a 9-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers offense, meanwhile, has averaged about five runs a
game this season, but you wouldn't know it from the past two games.
After getting just five hits Friday night, including one over the
final eight innings, the Dodgers had just three off Seattle starter
Aaron Sele (11-3) in seven innings and two in the ninth off Brett
Tomko.
</P>
<P>
   Sele has pitched just twice against the Dodgers, but he's 2-0
with a 1.29 ERA against them, a span of 14 innings. He last beat
them June 7, 1999 while with Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, he walked four, struck out three, didn't give up a hit
until the third inning and pitched out of a jam in the seventh. He
walked Karros and Hundley with one out and gave up a single to
right to Jim Leyritz before getting Adrian Beltre to ground into an
inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers hope one day Gagne can regularly pitch out of
similar jams and that Saturday was just a minor setback.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these things he's going through, he'll benefit from,''
Osteen said. ``I always say you learn more from adversity than when
you're ringing everyone's bell.''

SHEFFIELD IS PUT ON HOLD BY SELIG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Gary Sheffield heard from his agent, who heard from
the players union that his suspension appeal would be heard in
Atlanta during the All-Star break. Los Angeles Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson and general manager Kevin Malone heard the same
thing.
</P>
<P>
   As so often happens when you play ``Telephone,'' the message
changes along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sheffield's appeal won't be heard by commissioner Bud Selig
in Atlanta, and there's no date set. The Dodgers don't play in New
York (site of Selig's office) again this season. The closest they
come is July 28-30 in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The frustration level mounts, but Johnson has passed the boiling
point. Not only does he fear Sheffield having to serve his
five-game suspension during August, he hasn't been told when the
suspensions for Carlos Perez, F.P. Santangelo and Mike Fetters are
supposed to start.
</P>
<P>
   It has been reported Perez will serve his five games starting
July 16, followed by Fetters for one game July 21 and Santangelo
for five games starting July 22. But no baseball official has told
Johnson, and he's finding it difficult to set up his rotation and
make roster moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like going in for detention, but 'I'll tell you when.'
That's hard,'' Johnson said. ``Are these suspension cut in stone? I
read it in the paper, but nobody's given me official notification
in the form of a letter or fax. ... I've got to try managing around
these suspensions, and not knowing isn't right.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said he has tried to reach officials in Atlanta, site of
Tuesday's All-Star Game, and felt the end of the ordeal is near.
Sheffield said he just wants the matter resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Familiarity: Shortstop Alex Cora knows Seattle shortstop Alex
Rodriguez from his days in Miami through a mutual friend. Cora said
Rodriguez is ``a nice guy and one of the boys.'' Plus, Cora's
brother, Joey, was Rodriguez's teammate from 1995-'98.
</P>
<P>
   So it was a little ironic when they collided at second base
Friday night. Rodriguez suffered a grade two concussion (grade
three is most severe) and a sprained knee. He didn't play Saturday,
won't play today and won't play in Tuesday's All-Star Game,
although he will attend. Carlos Guillen started in his place
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   For Cora, collisions are just part of the game, but it was hard
to see Rodriguez lying motionless near second base.
</P>
<P>
   Cora tried to call Providence Hospital - where Rodriguez stayed
Friday night - but was unsuccessful in reaching him. Rodriguez was
released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle team doctor Larry Pedegana said Rodriguez will be out
for a week because of the concussion, but it's not known how long
the knee might sideline him. Rodriguez's head injury took priority
at the hospital. Pedegana said no knee tests were done.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get a chance I'll talk to him,'' Cora said. ``It's not
about apologizing, I want to see how he feels.''
</P>
<P>
   Bumps and bruises: Mark Grudzielanek has the flu, and F.P.
Santangelo caught it, so he didn't start. Rookie Mike Metcalfe got
the start at second base. ...
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Todd Hundley bruised his right thumb in the 11th inning
of Friday's game. On the third-to-last pitch of the game, Jay
Buhner fouled a ball off Hundley's thumb, leaving it black and
blue.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley said he can grip a bat but can't grip a baseball, so he
started at designated hitter (Johnson said the switch-hitting
Hundley can bat only left-handed). With Chad Kreuter serving his
eight-game suspension, Jim Leyritz started behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Hundley won't catch today's game, either, and he's
looking for a right-handed DH to start against Seattle left-hander
Jamie Moyer. ...
</P>
<P>
   Closer Jeff Shaw threw Friday and could be reactivated for
Thursday's game against the Angels, which is his scheduled return
date. Johnson said Shaw threw ``the best stuff he had all year.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Of the Los Angeles Avengers' 10 losses in their
inaugural season, Saturday night's was without question the most
painful, on multiple levels.
</P>
<P>
   Four players, including quarterback Todd Marinovich, left the
game with injuries, and the Avengers had their playoff hopes
officially ended by a 75-72 loss to the San Jose SaberCats in front
of 13,034 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went through some crutches tonight,'' said Avengers coach
Stan Brock, whose team fell to 3-10 with only next Friday's road
game against Buffalo remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Avengers' attempts to control San Jose's pass rush and shut
down the SaberCats' trio of quick receivers were also painful to
watch, but of more immediate concern were the conditions of the
injured players, the most serious of whom, lineman Victor Hall, was
taken off the field on a stretcher in the third quarter with a neck
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, playing defense, made a tackle near the sideline and was
accidently hit on the helmet by a teammate who also converged on
the play. Team owner Casey Wasserman said Hall had movement in ale

</P>

injured players, the most serious of whom, lineman Victor Hall, was
taken off the field on a stretcher in the third quarter with a neck
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, playing defense, made a tackle near the sideline and was
accidently hit on the helmet by a teammate who also converged on
the play. Team owner Casey Wasserman said Hall had movement in all
extremities and was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles
for precautionary tests.
</P>
<P>
   The Avengers also lost defensive back Tray Crayton (foot) and
receiver Damian Groce (knee) but suffered their most serious blow
in the first quarter when Marinovich bruised his left rib cage when
he was hit after letting go of a pass.
</P>
<P>
   Marinovich, who said he initially injured his ribs in last
week's loss to Milwaukee, came back to throw a touchdown on the
next play but was replaced in the next series by Scott
Semptimphelter and did not return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm obviously really sore,'' Marinovich said. ``It wasn't a
real serious hit, it was more of a re-injury from last week.''
</P>
<P>
   In between all the injuries, there actually was some football
being played, and the SaberCats (11-2) won their 10th consecutive
game with an impressive offensive effort against the Avengers'
overmatched defensive backs.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Mark Grieb completed 20 of 31 attempts for 346 yards
and six touchdowns and connected with receiver Steve Papin for 13
catches, 232 yards and three scores. Every time the Avengers got
close, Grieb and the SaberCats would push the advantage back to a
comfortable margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Avengers, who trailed by just eight points twice in the
third quarter, fell behind by 21 in the fourth but rallied.
Semptimphelter hit Travis Hannah with a 36-yard touchdown pass with
46 seconds remaining and the Avengers recovered on onside kick and
scored again when Semptimphelter and Anthony Rice connected on an
18-yard scoring pass to make the score 75-72.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose recovered the second onside attempt and ran out the
clock.
</P>
<P>
   Semptimphelter, who started the first four games of the season
but had taken just two snaps since mid-May, completed 18 of 31
attempts for 312 yards and seven touchdowns, but even with the
efforts of Hannah (seven catches, 124 yards, three touchdowns) and
Chris Jackson (six catches, 102 yards, one touchdown), the Avengers
could not match San Jose's offensive firepower.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a 20-man roster, and when you lose four guys that's
pretty big,'' Brock said. ``One of (the 20) is the kicker, so that
basically left about 13 players who played a big part of the
game.''

 &HT;    Where have you gone, Jackie Robinson?
 &HT;    By Israel Gutierrez
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When Buck O'Neil was playing for the Kansas
City Monarchs of the Negro Leagues in the 1930s and 1940s, the love
for baseball spilled over onto the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Famer O'Neil, teammate of Hall of Fame pitcher
Satchel Paige, remembers watching black children in the city
neighborhoods playing stickball, imagining themselves as the next
Paige or O'Neil.
</P>
<P>
   For years before and years after Jackie Robinson broke Major
League Baseball's color barrier in 1947, baseball was the sport of
choice for America's black youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``All kids played baseball during that time,'' said O'Neil, who
broke the major-league coaching color barrier when he took a
position with the Cubs in 1962. ``Their daddies before them played
baseball. It might have been semipro teams, but everybody played
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time, that was more or less the only outlet for the
black kid _ baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward six decades. Pittsburgh Pirates first baseman Kevin
Young believes Robinson would be disappointed if he saw the racial
makeup of baseball today.
</P>
<P>
   Young and Adrian Brown are the only black players on the
Pirates' 25-man roster. It's a ratio that's become common in
baseball at every level.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have so many Latin players, and their dark skin kind of
makes everybody go, 'Oh, there they (the black players) are,' ''
Young said. ``But you look at our team, and it's me and Adrian
Brown and that's it. And then you have five other Latin players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt you notice that from team to team. It's very
rare now to see a team with four African-American players on it.
It's definitely something that's on the decline and is trying to be
addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of black players in Major League Baseball dropped
to 15 percent in 1998, the lowest percentage of the decade,
according to the Center for the Study of Sport in Society at
Northeastern University. By comparison, the percentage of Latin
players reached an all-time high (25 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of black players on rosters still hovers around
15 percent this season. In 1959, when Pumpsie Green joined the
Boston Red Sox, the last team to integrate its roster, the
percentage was 17.9. In 1980, the number reached 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But 53 years after Robinson, the numbers are on the decline,
prompting concerns about the sport's future with blacks, and asking
the question, ``Why the disinterest?'' At least one former
major-leaguer wonders if the future of the league will look more
like the pre-Robinson days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over history, (blacks) have been excellent players. You want
this to continue,'' said Monte Irvin, who was originally chosen to
break baseball's color barrier but was delayed until 1949 by
military service and health problems. ``You don't want to go to a
game and not see any African-American representatives. The way it's
going, in another 20 years there might not be any. I'd hate to see
that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   While the number of black athletes in basketball and football
also are slipping slightly, the dwindling numbers in those sports
still don't compare to baseball. According to the Northeastern
study, blacks make up nearly 70 percent of professional football
rosters and the number reaches 80 percent in basketball.
</P>
<P>
   So how did baseball reach this point? The answer lies in the
inner cities and with today's youth.
</P>
<P>
   BASKETBALL, FOOTBALL DOMINATE
</P>
<P>
   When O'Neil visits those same neighborhoods where he once saw
stickball played in the streets, he now sees packed basketball
courts and football in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Puerto Rico, Cuba and places like that, it's the same thing
as it was in the inner city when Jackie went in,'' O'Neil said.
``Everybody wanted to play baseball. 'This is my way to get out of
here.' Right now, they've got so many different ways to get out of
the ghetto than they had in my time. Baseball, that was your way
out.''
</P>
<P>
   If athletics is the chosen path, they now gravitate toward the
sports that better promote black players, said Richard Lapchick, a
sports sociologist and author of the Northeastern study.
</P>
<P>
   Even after his retirement, Michael Jordan is a more prominent
television figure than any black baseball star. During his playing
days, Jordan was the poster child of the NBA and played the role of
athletic icon and role model to near perfection. It's an aspect
clearly lacking in Major League Baseball promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. probably is the most marketable black superstar
in baseball, yet baseball has not taken full advantage of his
marketability, Lapchick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It caught on a little bit, but not the way that Jordan was
marketed,'' Lapchick said. ``Jordan was clearly the greatest player
of his generation, but a lot of baseball people argued that Griffey
also was but wasn't even close to being marketed that way. I think
they could have done something with it.''
</P>
<P>
   If baseball would have taken a cue from the NBA, the sport could
have more budding black stars like Marlins center fielder Preston
Wilson, even though he too was caught up in Jordan-mania.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson called basketball his ``first love,'' and never seriously
considered baseball until high school, an interest that may never
have developed if not for his family ties to the sport _ Wilson's
stepfather Mookie Wilson played 12 major-league seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while there, Jordan was all everybody saw,'' said
Wilson, 25, one of six black players on the current Marlins roster.
``That was pretty big to see Michael Jordan. Everybody wanted to
play like Jordan. Everybody wanted to take Mike's moves. When you
look at the number of blacks that used to play baseball in the past
decades and how big the sport was for blacks, to see that there
aren't that many playing now, you really have to wonder what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   From Little League teams to high school teams to college teams,
the trend is noticeable. Of the 5,796 athletes who received some
NCAA scholarship aid in baseball during the 1997-98 academic year,
only 376 (6.5 percent) were African-American.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally black colleges such as Florida A&AMP;M and
Bethune-Cookman fill their baseball rosters with whites or Latins
because not enough blacks are interested. Inner-city high schools
across the country are doing away with their baseball programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is looked down upon, at least where I come from,''
said Ron Calloway, a Jupiter Hammerheads outfielder who went to
high school in San Jose, Calif. ``I guess there are some places
where baseball is the thing to do, but it wasn't like that at my
school.''
</P>
<P>
   HIRING PRACTICES QUESTIONED
</P>
<P>
   Lapchick says there's another factor _ Major League Baseball's
hiring practice.
</P>
<P>
   There are no black general managers in the majors and just four
black managers, and minority hiring is a controversial topic that
comes up almost every off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents and families of color have a perspective that is far
different than white families, in that white families don't have to
think about those things because (whites) get those opportunities
irrespective of the color of their skin,'' Lapchick said. ``If
you're a person of color, that is very much a factor of everything
that happens in your life. That's a perspective that parents are
going to communicate to their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has recognized the problem and Commissioner Bud Selig
now requires teams to submit a list of candidates for manager and
front-office positions to make sure minorities are considered.
Lapchick called Selig's decision ``one of the most important things
a commissioner has done about this issue (of race), ever.''
</P>
<P>
   John Young helped institute a more grass-roots solution. In
1989, he founded RBI (Reviving Baseball in Inner cities), a program
that sponsors baseball leagues in inner cities.
</P>
<P>
   Young began the program in Los Angeles, but it has since
expanded into 137 cities worldwide. This year, 10 RBI participants
were selected in baseball's amateur draft.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Brasuell, RBI's director, said the target is not only
black children, but any youths who would not normally be able to
afford the costs of equipment for a Little League team.
</P>
<P>
   But 59 percent of RBI participants are black, a much higher
number than the percentage currently playing the sport in college
or professionally.
</P>
<P>
   Marlins reliever Vic Darensbourg coached in an RBI league in
California and noticed most of the children still favored the more
fast-paced sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun and hectic at the same time,'' Darensbourg said.
``A few of them had a heart for the game. Most of them, they'd
rather play basketball or football.''
</P>
<P>
   Marlins pitcher Chuck Smith acknowledges RBI's success, but
still would like to personally reach out to the inner cities to
find baseball talent. It's how he discovered his own talent.
</P>
<P>
   Smith grew up on the east side of Cleveland in the projects of
Garden Valley, where his father volunteered to coach a city youth
team made up of Rainbow Terrace Projects residents.
</P>
<P>
   That team folded after one year, but Smith and some teammates
went on to another team in the same city league, this one run by
former Negro Leagues player Johnny Rosco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a separated city,'' Smith said. ``You've got your whites
on the west side and you've got your blacks on the east side. So
when we played the city championship it was black against white. We
dominated the city of Cleveland for years.''
</P>
<P>
   That domination made Smith believe in his baseball abilities. So
when he sees the dwindling numbers of blacks playing baseball, he
uses his Cleveland days as an example of the untapped potential in
the inner cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like they go to the Dominican Republic and Venezuela to
get the talent from over there, there's just as much talent in the
city, you've just got to find it,'' Smith said. ``Baseball isn't
giving those areas enough attention to realize how much talent is
coming out of there. There's so many kids that could be saved. I'm
not saying baseball should try to save people, but there's a lot of
talent that could be given a chance.''

 &HT;    Ex-teacher finds joy helping a forest grow
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ever heard of snorkeling in North Georgia? Talk to
Brent Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Snorkeling on the Conasauga River in the state's northwest
corner is one of the joys the former history teacher counts in the
career change he made five years ago. ``Oh man,'' Martin exclaims,
``it's like being in an aquarium.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has come to love the annual ``insect walk'' along the
wild and scenic Chattooga River sponsored by Georgia Forest Watch,
the 750-member watchdog organization Martin heads. Two years ago
the organization won a National Wilderness Society award as a model
for groups springing up in the Southeast, where logging and roads
threaten forest ecology.
</P>
<P>
   The Conasauga River, which starts in the Cohutta wilderness and
makes a horseshoe loop into Tennessee before drifting back into
Georgia, is the only place on the planet where you can see the
Conasauga logperch, a tiny fish numbering fewer than 200. The
river, whose cool, crystal waters are a shock to city folks
accustomed to silt-laden streams, nourishes 92 species of fish,
including 13 on the federal threatened or endangered lists. Every
summer, Georgia Forest Watch sponsors three snorkeling events led
by expert biologists, each limited to 25 people.
</P>
<P>
   But mountain outings aren't Forest Watch's _ or Martin's _
mainstay. Preserving the 750,000-acre Chattahoochee National Forest
is. The organization, whose membership is split almost evenly
between Atlanta and mountain residents, was formed after the first
10-year forest management plan was completed in 1986, under a
federal law ushered in during Jimmy Carter's presidency. The plan
was appealed by environmentalists who thought it permitted too much
timber cutting. A settlement with the National Forest Service
called for a citizen watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, a Kennesaw College history instructor with a century of
family roots near Ellijay, Ga., volunteered with the group from its
beginnings in 1988. A few years later, he threw in the towel on his
Ph.D. in modern British history at Georgia State University and
devoted his career to his true passion: the environment. He was
named the first full-time CEO of Forest Watch in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bob Kibler, retired chief of Emory University's neurosurgery
department, stepped down as Forest Watch president last fall. He
credits Martin with maintaining a strong hand in the forest plan
the Chattahoochee district is finalizing. It protects watersheds
and proposes additions to wilderness areas.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Layfield, a Forest Service planner, says he makes it a
habit to call Martin to talk over logging and conservation issues.
``We don't always agree,'' he said, ``but we can work through just
about anything now.'' Martin grew up in a working-class family in
rural Cobb County, where he spent his boyhood coon hunting,
camping, fishing and collecting arrowheads near Nickajack Creek.
``I guess I never got over watching the woods I grew up in (being)
destroyed,'' he said. When Highlands Industrial Park was built in
south Cobb, the forest of his boyhood disappeared. ``I'm still mad
about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During his graduate studies, Martin helped historians document
the environmental history of North Georgia, poring over archival
maps dating to the Cherokee Indians and to subsequent eras when
mining and agricultural interests clear-cut the forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to appreciate the incredible job the Forest Service did
in bringing Southern forests back to life over the past 75 years,
regenerating oaks and other hardwoods,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin is critical of management policies that have placed
too much emphasis on road building and logging. Forest Watch and
the Sierra Club were instrumental in organizing a coalition of
environmental groups that won a landmark federal lawsuit against
the Forest Service last year that requires the agency to conduct an
assessment of species that might be harmed by proposed timber
projects before approving them. (Chattahoochee forest officials are
trying to change their own rules to get around the requirement _ an
effort being challenged by the Southern Environmental Law Center.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Valuing the forests,'' Martin says, ``is about valuing
place.''

 &HT;    Zedillo a class act in face of PRI defeat
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Largely overlooked in the coverage of the
Mexican presidential election is the grace with which incumbent
President Ernesto Zedillo and losing candidate Francisco Labastida
accepted the results.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo and Labastida, ranking members of the Party of the
Institutional Revolution (PRI) were both class acts as the results
came in with surprising swiftness _ not to mention clarity _ July
2.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo deserves a lot of credit for quickly taking the
initiative and the airwaves to broadcast his congratulations to
winner Vicente Fox and promising to work with him on a transition.
</P>
<P>
   It was a message that the transition would be both peaceful and
respectful.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida acted commendably and responsibly as well. A career
PRI-ista, Labastida made a graceful exit from 30 years of public
life. He may be back, but it's highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   It could not have been easy for the ranking members of a party
that has been in control of Mexican politics to do that. In fact,
there was no blueprint for reaction because the PRI has not lost a
presidential election since 1929.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Mexican presidents have been autocrats, whose power
was limited only by money and imagination. The 1980s saw an
insurgence _ a peaceful one but insurgence nonetheless _ to which
the PRI steadily lost ground.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his administration, Zedillo had the courage to renounce
the old ways of doing business by declaring that he was not going
to handpick a successor and then by having the tenacity to make
that decision stick.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the outgoing president picked the PRI nominee and
whoever got the dedazo (the finger tap) was assured of victory,
whether he had the majority of votes or not.
</P>
<P>
   However, when history judges his successor, it ought to have
kind words for Zedillo, who made this peaceful transition possible.
</P>
<P>
   The election results brought to mind a conversation I had last
fall in Mexico City with a North American business woman. ``Zedillo
hasn't done much for the country,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except bring democracy,'' I replied.
</P>
<P>
   THE THRILL OF VICTORY . . .
</P>
<P>
   After elections around here, a story emerges about this fellow
in Austin who walks up to the victor, embraces him or her warmly
and declares: ``Hey, we won!''
</P>
<P>
   It's urban legend, of course, one of those stories that crops up
when cocktail conversation turns to the light side of political
life. And like most humor what makes it funny is that it rings
true. Turns out it contains international truth as the reaction to
the Mexican presidential election shows.
</P>
<P>
   Only two weeks ago, many I approached and a few just volunteered
that the PRI would win. In the aftermath, comments _ delivered both
by e-mail and in person _ pretty much ran something like this: ``I
knew it all along.'' or ``This a great day for Mexico.'' ``The mood
here is one of joy.'' ``The system works.''
</P>
<P>
   Put another way: ``Ganamos.'' That means ``We won.''
</P>
<P>
   THE AGONY OF DEFEAT . . .
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the interests of full disclosure, I bet a friend of mine
that Labastida would win. The PRI, after all, had 71 years of
political domination going for it, as well as a tried-and-true
machine for delivering votes. Moreover, Mexicans are basically
conservative people who approach change as one would approach a
rattlesnake _ with great caution.
</P>
<P>
   I figured Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who came in third, would deny Fox
enough opposition votes to enable the PRI-istas to hold onto the
presidency. I also had enough evidence to put money on Fox, but
just couldn't quite bring myself to do it.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine in Mexico City who is quite an avid follower of
politics and who converses frequently with those in the know
assured me solemnly that when all was said and done, Labastida
would pull 43 percent; 35 percent would go to Fox and Cardenas
would take 16 percent. The really minor candidates would pick up
the change. He was right, just had the Fox and Labastida numbers
transposed.
</P>
<P>
   I sent him a note last Monday suggesting that we should each
re-evaluate our futures as fortune tellers.

 &HT;    What next for Netscape?
 &HT;    By Heather Cocks
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. _ A tongue-in-cheek shrine commands a
second-story wall at Netscape Communications Corp.: collages of
cut-out photos, articles, cartoons and e-mail jokes ripping
Microsoft Corp. founder Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Deep in the heart of the Netscape engineering department, where
software writers create the Navigator browser, the anti-tribute is
a motivational tool of sorts. The enemy's in sight, but he's
stripped of his imposing aura.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly subtle, the display symbolizes a future Netscape hopes is
imminent. All year, its engineers have quietly honed a new weapon
pointed right at Microsoft _ a Web browser created with visions of
humbling the software giant's dominant Internet Explorer program.
</P>
<P>
   The next generation of computer software will be written for use
on the Web, making the Web browser battle between Netscape and
Microsoft the Internet world's equivalent of Windows vs. Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape's upcoming offering, version 6.0, is designed to be a
sleeker, faster program that can run on a personal computer or a
smaller Internet-enabled device. A warm reception from consumers
and corporate partners alike could, in theory, turn the tide _ or
at least win an important skirmish _ in the long-running browser
wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we think about the competitive landscape,'' said
Chris Nalls, product manager for Netscape 6.0. ``We're very much
heads-down, focusing on getting this product out because we think
it's compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   To stop the free fall, it needs to be.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, 80 percent of Web surfers used Netscape's
product, which was virtually alone in a hot market. But after
pricing problems and a reputation for unreliability, combined with
hot competition from Microsoft, Netscape is now flirting with rock
bottom. A bare 13.9 percent of global Web denizens used Netscape's
product as of June 18, according to research company WebSideStory.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, a whopping 86 percent slice of the populace surfs
with the Microsoft browser. Even Netscape's parent company, America
Online Inc., years ago chose Internet Explorer as its default
browser sothat the AOL software might come pre-installed on
computers running the omnipresent Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Microsoft, which declined to comment for this
story, is so far ahead that there's no longer much point in
challenging it.
</P>
<P>
   RISE AND FALL From its 1994 debut until about 1996, Netscape
dominated the Web-browser market and began charging $50 for
unchallenged software.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft changed things when it launched the then-fresh Windows
95 operating system, which came with an early version of Internet
Explorer that symbolized the company's commitment to the Web. The
Redmond, Wash.,-based company pumped millions into its browser to
put it head-to-head with Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1998, the two companies leapfrogged each other in the race
to release better versions of their browsers _ and Netscape's
customer base dwindled. A University of Illinois study showed that
from early 1996 through mid-1998, Netscape's 70-percent share of
the market eroded to a 50-50 split with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Then Netscape dropped out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1998, poring through six years' worth of scripted code,
the company's software team threw up its hands and threw out the
Navigator program. Instead of retooling something tethered to a
legacy losing steam, Netscape decided to start from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   The software writers spent 18 months creating a smoother, more
potent engine to power the redesigned software. They toiled under
an aluminum soda-can replica of the Golden Gate Bridge, suspended
with paper clips and spanning the office, and by the
orange-and-green neon lights peeking through a translucent
cylindrical ``Warp Core'' built of empty Aquafina bottles _ both
products of work-numbed minds seeking release.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape 6.0 is now available in a beta version, an early
preview that's still being tweaked and tested but which can be
downloaded via the Internet. The company promises two more betas
before the final product's scheduled release late this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullet you chew is the amount of time it takes to get the
product out, and it's never fast enough for anybody,'' Nalls said.
``But it was absolutely the right decision to take the hit,
redesign and have something glorious when we're done.''
</P>
<P>
   And ultimately, the timing may be optimal.
</P>
<P>
   The federal antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft centered around
competitive methods the U.S. government claims roughly elbowed
Netscape out of the market _ methods such as distributing Internet
Explorer for free with Windows and inking deals similar to the AOL
pact that once tied that Internet service to Explorer. Federal
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson dubbed Microsoft a monopoly and on
May 7 ordered that the company be split.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit unleashed a torrent of anti-Microsoft sentiment that
could translate into a resurgence for Netscape if its latest
version meets early hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Netscape could come back, that would be great,'' said Bobby
George, a lead software engineer at Question.com Inc. ``We use
I.E., because it's one of those tools that you just have to use,
but I still like to pull for Netscape because everyone hates
Gates.''
</P>
<P>
   FOSTERING INNOVATION
</P>
<P>
   In Netscape's opinion, the guts of its browser are its true
glory.
</P>
<P>
   The engine that powers it all, christened Gecko after a tiny and
spry breed of lizard, is small enough to run on Internet
appliances. Gecko has attracted attention from companies such as
Intel Corp., Gateway Inc. and mobile-phone maker Nokia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving beyond the PC,'' Nalls said. ``We're seeing this
start now, with second and third Internet-access devices in the
home. These new platforms are very interesting to us.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the real buzz _ at least in Netscape's eyes _
is what version 6.0 means to software developers.
</P>
<P>
   The new Netscape is what's called an open-source program.
Developers can access its core code for free and use it to their
advantage, creating new looks and color schemes for the browser
itself or making a specially branded tab for the new ``My Sidebar''
window. Companies and consumer users alike can distribute those
designs to global users, with Netscape's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could hate your guts and you could still make a tab for the
browser, or a new program for it,'' said John Nagle, who handles
marketing for Netscape 6.0. ``This is more open to innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   Smiley said that availability could make it easier to win the
fight for dominance in the Internet-appliance market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a developer wanted to build some kind of handheld pad or an
appliance, and needs to get to the market fast, that kind of
openness will be attractive,'' Smiley said. ``There's fierce
competition, but there's no winner, so Netscape could get some real
traction.''
</P>
<P>
   To attract a programmer writing Web-based software, browsers
must be compatible with an ever-expanding list of popular computer
languages, such as JavaScript and XML. Around 1996, some Web pages
could not load on Netscape's product because the browser did not
comprehend Java program code.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're quick to go with whatever has the best features,'' said
George of Question.com, which bases most of its programs on
Internet Explorer. ``Both products went back and forth through the
cycle of who's going to invent the best thing first, and Netscape
started falling behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Netscape built the new program around newly established
industry-wide standards for designing Web pages _ a raft of
languages that can shorten the time it takes to download certain
pages and which allow for changes to a Web site that can be
processed without having to reload it from the server.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is also making its browser more compatible with these
standards, established by the World Wide Web Consortium. Netscape
expects to be the first to meet those standards completely, but
Smiley said its sudden compatibility isn't dramatic enough to
outweigh Microsoft, which all along was quicker to embrace new
languages as they popped up.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's asking for that stuff any more,'' Smiley said. ``They
want stability, they want it to work and they want customer
service. That will be the test.''
</P>
<P>
   THE NAME GAME
</P>
<P>
   Consumers will notice that Netscape 6.0 bears the footprints of
its parent company, America Online, which bought the company in
late 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail messenger on Netscape 6.0 is entwined with AOL's
popular Instant Messenger, denoting with a special icon any message
arriving from someone who's also logged onto the chat service.
Users with AOL accounts can also check that mail through Netscape's
inbox.
</P>
<P>
   But those new features match step-for-step the changes Microsoft
is making to its browser. Internet Explorer 5.5, due in September
as part of the Windows Millennium Edition, similarly marries the
Outlook Express e-mail with Microsoft's MSN real-time message
program and the company's free HotmMail e-mail accounts.
</P>
<P>
   And that package comes out before Netscape 6.0 _ thus, there's a
crafty marketing trick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naming it '6.0' is fluff,'' Smiley said. ``They did it to put
the version number ahead of Microsoft. There never was or will be a
Netscape 5.''
</P>
<P>
   The most striking changes are cosmetic, like the new dark-blue
color scheme, different icons and a retractable ``My Sidebar''
feature that can stay on-screen as people surf, tracking stocks and
news and storing the most recent search results for quick access.
</P>
<P>
   The program is also a smaller file _ just 5.5 megabytes,
occupying half the space inhabited by earlier versions and less
than the 7.8 megabytes required for Internet Explorer, according to
analyst Smiley.
</P>
<P>
   But even that might not matter in the war on the consumer front.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netscape was too late in its strategy,'' Smiley said. ``With
new high-speed Internet connections and faster computers, the
smaller file is a difference of just a few seconds, which is
meaningless.''

   MIDEAST-CLINTON _WASHINGTON _ President Clinton goes to Camp
David Sunday forwhat's likely to be his last clean shot at a high
stakes foreign policy win to burnish a legacy stained by scandal.
While he'll continue for the rest of his term to juggle an armful
of international issues _ China trade, national missile defense,
Balkans peacekeeping among them _ no other initiative has consumed
so much of his time, so captured the imagination of the public or
is so ripe for completion as the quest to end half a century of
conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. Appropriate to the
stakes for himself and for history, Clinton has chosen a venue rich
in symbolism and resonant with hope. (Deans, Cox News Service)

 &HT;    Where have you gone, Jackie Robinson?
 &HT;    By Israel Gutierrez
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When Buck O'Neil was playing for the Kansas
City Monarchs of the Negro Leagues in the 1930s and 1940s, the love
for baseball spilled over onto the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Famer O'Neil, teammate of Hall of Fame pitcher
Satchel Paige, remembers watching black children in the city
neighborhoods playing stickball, imagining themselves as the next
Paige or O'Neil.
</P>
<P>
   For years before and years after Jackie Robinson broke Major
League Baseball's color barrier in 1947, baseball was the sport of
choice for America's black youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``All kids played baseball during that time,'' said O'Neil, who
broke the major-league coaching color barrier when he took a
position with the Cubs in 1962. ``Their daddies before them played
baseball. It might have been semipro teams, but everybody played
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time, that was more or less the only outlet for the
black kid _ baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward six decades. Pittsburgh Pirates first baseman Kevin
Young believes Robinson would be disappointed if he saw the racial
makeup of baseball today.
</P>
<P>
   Young and Adrian Brown are the only black players on the
Pirates' 25-man roster. It's a ratio that's become common in
baseball at every level.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have so many Latin players, and their dark skin kind of
makes everybody go, 'Oh, there they (the black players) are,' ''
Young said. ``But you look at our team, and it's me and Adrian
Brown and that's it. And then you have five other Latin players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt you notice that from team to team. It's very
rare now to see a team with four African-American players on it.
It's definitely something that's on the decline and is trying to be
addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of black players in Major League Baseball dropped
to 15 percent in 1998, the lowest percentage of the decade,
according to the Center for the Study of Sport in Society at
Northeastern University. By comparison, the percentage of Latin
players reached an all-time high (25 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of black players on rosters still hovers around
15 percent this season. In 1959, when Pumpsie Green joined the
Boston Red Sox, the last team to integrate its roster, the
percentage was 17.9. In 1980, the number reached 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But 53 years after Robinson, the numbers are on the decline,
prompting concerns about the sport's future with blacks, and asking
the question, ``Why the disinterest?'' At least one former
major-leaguer wonders if the future of the league will look more
like the pre-Robinson days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over history, (blacks) have been excellent players. You want
this to continue,'' said Monte Irvin, who was originally chosen to
break baseball's color barrier but was delayed until 1949 by
military service and health problems. ``You don't want to go to a
game and not see any African-American representatives. The way it's
going, in another 20 years there might not be any. I'd hate to see
that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   While the number of black athletes in basketball and football
also are slipping slightly, the dwindling numbers in those sports
still don't compare to baseball. According to the Northeastern
study, blacks make up nearly 70 percent of professional football
rosters and the number reaches 80 percent in basketball.
</P>
<P>
   So how did baseball reach this point? The answer lies in the
inner cities and with today's youth.
</P>
<P>
   BASKETBALL, FOOTBALL DOMINATE
</P>
<P>
   When O'Neil visits those same neighborhoods where he once saw
stickball played in the streets, he now sees packed basketball
courts and football in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Puerto Rico, Cuba and places like that, it's the same thing
as it was in the inner city when Jackie went in,'' O'Neil said.
``Everybody wanted to play baseball. 'This is my way to get out of
here.' Right now, they've got so many different ways to get out of
the ghetto than they had in my time. Baseball, that was your way
out.''
</P>
<P>
   If athletics is the chosen path, they now gravitate toward the
sports that better promote black players, said Richard Lapchick, a
sports sociologist and author of the Northeastern study.
</P>
<P>
   Even after his retirement, Michael Jordan is a more prominent
television figure than any black baseball star. During his playing
days, Jordan was the poster child of the NBA and played the role of
athletic icon and role model to near perfection. It's an aspect
clearly lacking in Major League Baseball promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. probably is the most marketable black superstar
in baseball, yet baseball has not taken full advantage of his
marketability, Lapchick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It caught on a little bit, but not the way that Jordan was
marketed,'' Lapchick said. ``Jordan was clearly the greatest player
of his generation, but a lot of baseball people argued that Griffey
also was but wasn't even close to being marketed that way. I think
they could have done something with it.''
</P>
<P>
   If baseball would have taken a cue from the NBA, the sport could
have more budding black stars like Marlins center fielder Preston
Wilson, even though he too was caught up in Jordan-mania.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson called basketball his ``first love,'' and never seriously
considered baseball until high school, an interest that may never
have developed if not for his family ties to the sport _ Wilson's
stepfather Mookie Wilson played 12 major-league seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while there, Jordan was all everybody saw,'' said
Wilson, 25, one of six black players on the current Marlins roster.
``That was pretty big to see Michael Jordan. Everybody wanted to
play like Jordan. Everybody wanted to take Mike's moves. When you
look at the number of blacks that used to play baseball in the past
decades and how big the sport was for blacks, to see that there
aren't that many playing now, you really have to wonder what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   From Little League teams to high school teams to college teams,
the trend is noticeable. Of the 5,796 athletes who received some
NCAA scholarship aid in baseball during the 1997-98 academic year,
only 376 (6.5 percent) were African-American.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally black colleges such as Florida A&AMP;M and
Bethune-Cookman fill their baseball rosters with whites or Latins
because not enough blacks are interested. Inner-city high schools
across the country are doing away with their baseball programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is looked down upon, at least where I come from,''
said Ron Calloway, a Jupiter Hammerheads outfielder who went to
high school in San Jose, Calif. ``I guess there are some places
where baseball is the thing to do, but it wasn't like that at my
school.''
</P>
<P>
   HIRING PRACTICES QUESTIONED
</P>
<P>
   Lapchick says there's another factor _ Major League Baseball's
hiring practice.
</P>
<P>
   There are no black general managers in the majors and just four
black managers, and minority hiring is a controversial topic that
comes up almost every off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents and families of color have a perspective that is far
different than white families, in that white families don't have to
think about those things because (whites) get those opportunities
irrespective of the color of their skin,'' Lapchick said. ``If
you're a person of color, that is very much a factor of everything
that happens in your life. That's a perspective that parents are
going to communicate to their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has recognized the problem and Commissioner Bud Selig
now requires teams to submit a list of candidates for manager and
front-office positions to make sure minorities are considered.
Lapchick called Selig's decision ``one of the most important things
a commissioner has done about this issue (of race), ever.''
</P>
<P>
   John Young helped institute a more grass-roots solution. In
1989, he founded RBI (Reviving Baseball in Inner cities), a program
that sponsors baseball leagues in inner cities.
</P>
<P>
   Young began the program in Los Angeles, but it has since
expanded into 137 cities worldwide. This year, 10 RBI participants
were selected in baseball's amateur draft.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Brasuell, RBI's director, said the target is not only
black children, but any youths who would not normally be able to
afford the costs of equipment for a Little League team.
</P>
<P>
   But 59 percent of RBI participants are black, a much higher
number than the percentage currently playing the sport in college
or professionally.
</P>
<P>
   Marlins reliever Vic Darensbourg coached in an RBI league in
California and noticed most of the children still favored the more
fast-paced sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun and hectic at the same time,'' Darensbourg said.
``A few of them had a heart for the game. Most of them, they'd
rather play basketball or football.''
</P>
<P>
   Marlins pitcher Chuck Smith acknowledges RBI's success, but
still would like to personally reach out to the inner cities to
find baseball talent. It's how he discovered his own talent.
</P>
<P>
   Smith grew up on the east side of Cleveland in the projects of
Garden Valley, where his father volunteered to coach a city youth
team made up of Rainbow Terrace Projects residents.
</P>
<P>
   That team folded after one year, but Smith and some teammates
went on to another team in the same city league, this one run by
former Negro Leagues player Johnny Rosco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a separated city,'' Smith said. ``You've got your whites
on the west side and you've got your blacks on the east side. So
when we played the city championship it was black against white. We
dominated the city of Cleveland for years.''
</P>
<P>
   That domination made Smith believe in his baseball abilities. So
when he sees the dwindling numbers of blacks playing baseball, he
uses his Cleveland days as an example of the untapped potential in
the inner cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like they go to the Dominican Republic and Venezuela to
get the talent from over there, there's just as much talent in the
city, you've just got to find it,'' Smith said. ``Baseball isn't
giving those areas enough attention to realize how much talent is
coming out of there. There's so many kids that could be saved. I'm
not saying baseball should try to save people, but there's a lot of
talent that could be given a chance.''

 &HT;    Dry summer makes for thirsty bugs
 &HT;    By Jen Sansbury
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bugged out by watering restrictions?
</P>
<P>
   So are the bugs.
</P>
<P>
   As state and local governments limit outdoor sprinkler time,
homeowners tend to focus their efforts on watering lawns and plants
closest to their houses. By doing that, they end up attracting more
household pests, said Steve Arnold, owner of Atlanta's Peachtree
Pest Control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insects move in as close to the structures as they can get
because that's the only place they can usually find water,'' Arnold
said. ``The drought does the same thing for insects as it does for
people. It gets hot and they go find a place to cool off.''
</P>
<P>
   Ants in particular may head indoors for a drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually they'll make an entrance through a crack or crevice in
the bathroom or kitchen,'' said Winston Eason, a county
agricultural extension agent. ``You can expect it almost every
summer but usually we see a lot more of it when we have very dry
summers, mostly when people aren't able to water.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that ants like to take their food
underground, let it mold and then feed off it, said Don Chesney, an
exterminator at Elite Pest Control. When the ground is dry, it
disrupts the process and stirs up the ants.
</P>
<P>
   Chesney said the increase in ants coming indoors is simply a
function of a growing ant population engaging in typical summertime
habits.
</P>
<P>
   But Arnold said the dry conditions are affecting all kinds of
critters, from crickets and spiders to millipedes and roly-poly
pillbugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These insects are water dependent and are more apt to move
into those areas where water is more readily available, from a
leaky faucet to an irrigation system keeping your plants alive,''
Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   Pets may help bring more bugs inside as well, Eason said, from
ticks that thrive in warm weather to ants making a bee-line for the
water bowl on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are first and foremost attracted to water,'' he said.
``If food is there they will go ahead and help themselves to that,
too. The cat food will be a little bonus.''
</P>

   Arnold said the drought actually creates year-round bug issues.
If the healthier plants are closest to the house or even inside, so
are the insects that feed off the leaves, like leafhoppers,
caterpillars and aphids. They, in turn, lure the bugs that eat
them, such as ladybugs, spiders and earwigs. Some will then
``overwinter,'' or hibernate, inside.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the ladybugs that seemed to be getting inside
your house during the spring may actually have hatched there and
were trying to get out, Arnold said. So expect to see them again
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to have more problems every year the drought
continues,'' he said. ``They're going to utilize our homes as a way
of surviving.''

   CHINA-EXAM (Beijing) _ This is ``Black July'' in China, time for
the long-anticipated exam that determines who goes to college in a
country where a degree is seen as a ticket to prosperity, and
failure can mean consignment to drudgery. 1200 words. By Erik
Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   EGYPT-RIGHTS (Cairo) _ The arrest last week of a prominent
sociologist on suspicion of defaming Egypt has alarmed human rights
advocates around the region who say it reflects a policy among Arab
leaders toward political criticism that can best be described as
``killing the messenger.'' By Susan Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-POLITICS (Jerusalem) _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
governing coalition came under attack before the Camp David summit
meeting this week, as his biggest coalition partner said it would
quit the government; and his foreign minister, David Levy, said he
would boycott the talks. 1300 words. By Deborah Sontag.

   YUGO-KOSOVO (Gracanica, Yugoslavia) _ A U.N. agreement to

Serbs back into international institutions here, has deepened
divisions among them and caused a key Albanian politician to
suspend his own participation. 1200 words. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA (Moscow) _ Seven people were killed in two

beyond the rebel province. 500 words. By Michael R. Wines.
</P>
<P>
   NIRELAND-PROTESTS (Portadown, Northern Ireland) _ Orange Order
leaders call for protests across Northern Ireland after Protestants
are barred from taking their traditional parade route through a
Catholic area. 700 words. By Warren Hoge.
</P>
<P>
   POPE-GAYS (Rome) _ Pope John Paul II expresses ``bitterness''
about a gay-pride festival held in Rome during a Roman Catholic
Holy Year, saying the event was an affront to the church and the
``Christian values'' of the Italian capital. 600 words. By
Alessandra Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   HAITI-VOTE (Port-au-Prince) _ Haiti holds the second round of
elections likely to hand victory to the ruling party of former

home and abroad. 900 words. By David Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-POLITICS (Istanbul) _ The increasing likelihood that a
73-year-old former prime minister will go to prison for remarks in

   PAY-YOUR-WAY-PRISONS (Owensboro, Ky.) _ The county jailers of
Kentucky are eagerly preparing to levy room, board and medical
charges on inmates under a pay-your-way practice that dates to
medieval England but is finding fresh life in America, the global
leader in incarceration. Chief jailer Harold Taylor fondly recalls
his salad days in the 1960s when county inmates were respectful
winos who barely taxed the public budget, versus modern inmates who
sue for full dentistry, he says, running up bills under federal
regulations that under a new state law they will have to begin
footing. It's an increasingly fashionable practice nationwide in a
booming jail market now handling 10 million admissions a year.

   NAKED-SOLES (Lombard, Ill.) _ The barefoot movement is gaining
ground. Hundreds of people are baring their toes in unlikely
places, saying it is more comfortable, healthier, environmentally
friendly, even spiritually uplifting. Some like the dash of
iconoclasm it spices into their lives. And they like feeling
through their feet -- pebbly sidewalk, grainy dirt, velvety moss,
polished floors. The Dirty Sole Society, dedicated to ``helping one
another to get along in a shod world,'' has attracted over 600
members since its inception a few years ago. And there is Parents
for Barefoot Children and 17 Barefoot Hikers chapters. 1200. By Pam

   FISHING-QUOTAS (Washington) _ The way the government limits the
catch of fishermen may heighten the risks for those who go down to
the sea. In most waters, you can catch all the fish you are able
until the overall quota is reached. That spurs a mad race,
regardless of high seas and foul winds. Instead, reformers want
individual quotas: a boat can catch so much, and it can take its
time. 800. By Carl Hulse.

   TAX-CUT-POLITICS (Washington) _ With projections of the federal
budget surplus rising and both parties in full election-year mode,
the debate over tax cuts is shifting from whether to what kinds.
Republicans continue to press for bigger reductions than most
Democrats will support, and the super-charged politics of the
campaign season will make it difficult for any tax cuts to be
enacted before a new president and Congress take office next year.
But in Washington and on the campaign trail, Democrats from
President Clinton on down are joining Republicans in backing tax
cuts -- enthusiastically in some cases, grudgingly and with
conditions in others -- to a far greater degree than they were a
year or even six months ago. 1500. By Richard W. Stevenson.

   JEWISH-PRESS-MEDIA (Undated) _ Usually, The New York Jewish Week
newspaper, affiliated with the UJA-Federation, sees its job as
putting the Jewish community in a positive light. And so it was a
remarkable departure for the paper to run an extensive
investigative article recently about a local rabbi, the regional
director of the Orthodox Union's summer youth program, who had been
accused for years of sexual improprieties toward teen-age girls.
After the article appeared, the rabbi was fired, despite his
insistence that the accusations were false. The reaction, within
the metropolitan Jewish community, as well as the regional and
national Jewish press, highlights the tension between advocacy and
objectivity in specialized journalism that is aimed at specific
religious, ethnic or cultural groups. By Felicity Barringer.

 &HT;    ISRAELIS AT ODDS ON EVE OF PEACE SUMMIT
 &HT;    Moving in the (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By Bob Deans and Larry Kaplow
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON After hearing a prayer for peace, President Clinton
spent Sunday preparing for this week's Mideast peace summit even as
Israel's fragile ruling coalition seemed to be falling apart over
the Palestinian issue.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the continuing political turmoil in Jerusalem, Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators arrived here to begin setting the
diplomatic table for the make-or-break Camp David talks.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat were scheduled to arrive late Monday for the summit, which
is due to begin Tuesday at the secluded presidential retreat in the
mountains of western Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Highlighting the difficulties, Barak's ruling coalition suffered
its third defection since the summit was announced last week when
the second-largest party in his ruling coalition pulled its support
to protest the peace initiative.
</P>
<P>
   It was yet another embarrassing reminder of his precarious
political position at home.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, Barak's foreign minister, David Levy of yet a
fourth group, the Gesher Party, said he would boycott the summit.
</P>
<P>
   The ultra-religious Shas was the third party in the past week to
withdraw its support from the Barak government. Those losses have
cut Barak's coalition to 42 members in Israel's 120-seat
parliament, the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
   In a move aimed at embarrassing Barak on the eve of the Camp
David summit, the Knesset is scheduled to vote Monday on a
no-confidence motion. Approval would result in the dissolution of
Barak's government.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak is expected to weather that attack, with the support
of about 20 Knesset members who are not formal members of his
coalition but who nevertheless broadly support his approach to the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow I am leaving, heading the Israeli delegation with a
grave and difficult feeling of responsibility,'' Barak said in a
nationally televised address to the Israeli people Sunday night.
``I intend to sign only an agreement that will guarantee the
security of the people of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clinton hopes to broker a deal to end half a
century of war and enmity between Arabs and Jews by reprising some
of the deft statecraft that enabled President Jimmy Carter deliver
the historic Israeli-Egyptian peace accord at Camp David 22 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Raising the ante in the high-stakes summit, White House National
Security Advisor Samuel Berger warned of ``a slide to turmoil'' in
the conflicted region, should the coming talks fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without an agreement, there is a certain path to turmoil,''
Berger said on CBS' Face The Nation. ``You are going to have, I
believe, an unraveling,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton felt the weight of the moment during church services
replete with powerful symbols of the ancient struggles he hopes to
help resolve in lands holy to Christians, Moslems and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blessed are the peacemakers,'' senior minister J. Philip
Wogaman said during his sermon. At one point he looked down to
Clinton's second-row pew and said, to applause by the congregation,
``Mr. President, you go with our prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, White House officials continue to voice confidence in
Barak's ability to represent his country in good faith efforts to
secure a peace accord. Barak has pledged to submit any such
agreement for a nationwide referendum.
</P>
<P>
   ``He trusts his ability to negotiate a fair deal,'' Dennis Ross,
senior White House envoy for the Middle East, said in an interview
with CNN. ``... He trusts his ability to be able to take that to
the Israeli public.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright spent the
afternoon with working-level Israeli and Palestinian officials,
attempting to refine areas of possible give and take in a complex
and contentious agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The chief aim of the talks is to bring to fruition a peace
process that began in earnest seven years ago with the
Israeli-Palestinian agreement reached through secret negotiations
in Oslo, Norway. Under the so-called Oslo accords, Israel is
obligated to turn over occupied territory to Palestinian control in
exchange for security guarantees and full diplomatic and economic
relations with its Palestinian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   While Israel has turned over to Palestinian control the Gaza
Strip and more than 40 percent of the occupied West Bank of the
Jordan River, the remaining thorny issues form the core of the
long-running Israeli-Palestinian dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Those include the question of Palestinian statehood, borders,
water rights, the ability of Palestinian refugees to return to
former homelands now under Israeli control and the future of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Together, agreements on those issues would constitute a
comprehensive set of accords that could end five decades of
fighting between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>

Jerusalem.)

`FISHBONE': SPANNING TRADITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JON PARELES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If there is one impulse shared across
African-American music, it is the determination to convert
tribulation into good-time music. That impulse links blues and
calypso, reggae and rumba, and it takes hyperactive form with
Fishbone, which headlined Central Park Summerstage on Saturday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   From its beginnings in the late 1970s, Fishbone has been a
breathtakingly ambitious band, and one that knocks itself out to
entertain an audience. Its songs are not only eager to address the
ills of everyone from hapless lovers to victims of nuclear attack,
but also to sum up American (and Jamaican) party music from the
swing era onward.
</P>
<P>
   Angelo Moore, Fishbone's lead singer and saxophonist, sang about
``AIDS and Armageddon'' over chomping, ratcheting New Orleans funk
verses with a reggae chorus; ``Karma Tsunami'' was a frenetic
mixture of gospel, ska, punk and two-beat. Not all his concerns
were global: He also bemoaned a failed marriage to the bouncy
reggae of ``Suffering'' and ogled Spandex contours in a ska tune,
``Where'd You Get Those Pants.'' All four songs were from
Fishbone's current album, ``The Psychotic Friends Nuttwerx''
(Hollywood).
</P>
<P>
   While the core of Fishbone's music is revved-up Jamaican ska,
its set also touched on progressive rock, hip-hop and jump-blues,
not to mention funk variants from Detroit and Minneapolis. Moore
threw in a Little Richard falsetto whoop and some Sly Stone growls.
He also bounded across the stage, recited poetry, mugged like a
born comedian and launched himself into the happily moshing crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Despite lineup changes through the years _ including the
replacement of its founding drummer, Fish, by John Steward _
Fishbone still tears through its songs like a band jamming in a
garage, then reveals its precision with an instantaneous stop or a
sudden jump into a different style. Its career timing hasn't been
as good. It was too early for the California ska revival that it
foreshadowed, and it has remained too eclectic, and too raunchy,
for most commercial radio stations. But onstage Fishbone is still
an all-American underdog, playing its musical erudition and serious
ideas for very knowing laughs.
</P>
<P>
   The Persuasions, who opened the concert, are a five-man a
capella group that has been singing together for 37 years. Their
roots are in doo-wop and its antecedent, gospel quartet singing;
they usually place three-part harmony between Jimmy Hayes'
subterranean, nonsense-syllable bass lines and Jerry Lawson's
exhortatory baritone leads.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, concerts by the Persuasions' have relied on
1950s oldies, but they have lately moved their time-line forward.
They recently released ``Frankly a Cappella'' (Earthbeat), an album
of songs by Frank Zappa, whose label released the first Persuasions
album in 1970, and they have recorded an album of Grateful Dead
songs to be released in October. Onstage, they repatriated both
Zappa's infuriated cynicism and the Dead's frontier romance to the
three-chord warmth of doo-wop.
</P>
<P>
   Disc jockey Swamp, a turntablist who is now in Beck's band,
played a solo set with two turntables and a laptop. He scratched
records, and sometimes just the needle itself, to make chirrups,
whistles, shivers, whooshes, scrapes and hard-rock chords. He
rapped along with his own scratching, boasting that now,
``Everybody wants to be a D.J.,'' but ``it takes more than your mom
buying two Technics, you geek.'' He delivered precise bursts of
sound while controlling discs with his nose or his elbows (as he
played the word ``elbow'' repeatedly). It was like a latter-day
vaudeville act: geeky showmanship for both eyes and ears.

SAMPLING SKIN PARTICLES THAT BODIES SHED TO FIND CARRIERS OF
CONTRABAND 
</HEADLINE>
   By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each human body generates a column of slightly warm air that
originates at the tops of the feet, swirls and rises, gathering
speed and increasing in volume, staying with us as we move through
the day and ascending the length of our torsos until it flows from
the tops of our heads in an invisible geyser of air altered by
movement and body temperature.
</P>
<P>
   As this envelope of warmer air surrounds us and rises, it
carries with it the skin particles that are continuously shed from
our bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Settles has named this phenomenon the ``human thermal
plume.'' Settles, a scientist at the Penn State Research
Foundation, says all people produce such an air column. And he has
patented a system for sampling each person's plume to detect the
presence of illegal drugs, or chemicals that might be used in
weapons or explosives.
</P>
<P>
   He has designed a portal similar to the metal detectors common
like airports and courthouses. As people pass through, a sample of
the air from each thermal plume would be analyzed to see if the
person was carrying a bomb or other contraband.
</P>
<P>
   Settles says his invention produces a socially acceptable,
equal-opportunity inspection because it can sample molecules around
every passenger in an airport without singling out individuals
according to race or other characteristics. The system makes it
practical to inspect everyone, he says, instead of selecting only a
random number of travelers.
</P>
<P>
   That's because everyone continuously sheds microscopic flakes of
skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been found that the entire outer layer of skin is shed
every one or two days,'' his patent application explains. ``It
turns out that some millions of skin flakes are shed by the average
person every minute.''
</P>
<P>
   The flakes, he says, are tiny enough to pass through the weave
of clothing and light enough to be swept up immediately into the
air plume. ``The air heated by the skin, being warmer and less
dense than the surrounding air, rises naturally according to
Archimedes' Principle,'' he explains. ``This generates a human
boundary layer. For a standing person, the boundary layer begins at
the ankles and travels up the legs and torso, growing thicker and
faster as it moves.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time it reaches the chest area, this layer of air is
several centimeters thick and moving quickly. It forms the same way
regardless of height, weight, or the amount or style of clothing,
and every surface of the body contributes skin flakes to the moving
air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus, any location where explosives might be concealed, such
as the ankles, legs, thighs, waist, arms,'' he says, ``all
contribute about equally to the buoyant airstream which eventually
rises above the body to form the thermal plume.''
</P>
<P>
   Settles' detector is a partly enclosed structure with a
funnel-shaped collector above the heads of people who pass through
and pause a few seconds. A fan or blower would draw the human
thermal plume into a filter or particulate separator, where it
would be analyzed in an ion mobility spectrometer, a device
measuring electrons, for the presence of explosive molecules.
</P>
<P>
   The sensor would be able to detect minute traces of plastic
explosives that are imperceptible to metal detectors. Currently,
specially trained dogs can sniff those small amounts, and hand-held
wands or treated cloths wiped across a suspect surface can also
isolate them.
</P>
<P>
   But Settles thinks that neither wipes, wands nor dogs can
realistically inspect the great number of travelers in an airport.
He says his system would not require any contact with people being
tested.
</P>
<P>
   Settles says his invention could also be used to detect smuggled
money, narcotics, chemical or biological warfare agents, nuclear
substances like uranium, or other hazardous material. And he
maintains that the skin flakes could provide samples of human DNA,
though his patent says nothing about the privacy concerns that
would be raised by such a feature. Settles received patent number
6,073,499.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C., 20231.

E-RETAILERS TURN TO THE PRINTED PAGE TO PUT THEIR WARES BEFORE
CONSUMERS
</HEADLINE>
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Online retailers have been putting their marketing budgets on
crash diets this year _ replacing pricey, fatty television ads and
portal deals with leaner print ads and e-mail efforts that, like
all diet foods, may be less sumptuous but are far healthier in the
long run. More recently, dot-com retailers are testing a new item
on the low-fat marketing menu: catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Long a staple of the direct marketing industry, catalogs are the
newest fad among Web merchants who, in their pursuit of
profitability, have cast off any pretensions of Internet-only
retailing.
</P>
<P>
   It should come as no surprise, of course, that Web merchants
like RedEnvelope.com, eHats, Food.com, and eZiba.com, among others,
have either begun mass mailings or are developing such programs. It
is an accepted fact that online shoppers and catalog consumers are
a similar breed, preferring to browse through merchandise without
the help of a sales clerk, and accepting the risks inherent in
long-distance purchasing. And the back-office operations of catalog
and consumer-oriented e-commerce companies are nearly identical.
</P>
<P>
   But the catalog leanings of Internet retailers can also be
explained by looking at their executive rosters. The dot-coms spent
much of 1998 and 1999 raiding the management teams of L.L. Bean and
other giants of the direct mail realm, so it was probably
inevitable that many Web merchants would expand into catalog
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Although these Internet executives are not abandoning other
marketing campaigns as they adopt catalogs, they express delighted
surprise about how well catalogs compare with other popular
marketing approaches, like e-mail advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can produce and mail a catalog that costs about the same,
if not less, than a targeted e-mail campaign,'' said Matt Jackson,
vice president for marketing at eHats, an online hat retailer that
is developing its first catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies that conduct custom e-mail campaigns on behalf of
e-tailers may charge 25 cents or more per e-mail sent, Jackson
said. According to the Direct Marketing Association, most catalogs
cost 50 cents to $1 to print and mail to each household.
</P>
<P>
   ``With an e-mail, people either delete it or look at it quickly
and delete it,'' he said. ``But if we execute a catalog properly,
we know it'll not only get eyeballs, but it'll stay in someone's
house, so it has a shelf life and a much longer lasting impact than
a targeted e-mail campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   With catalogs, e-tailers also see a way to reach an objective
that no amount of digital alchemy can achieve _ selling goods to
the 50 percent of American households that remain without Internet
connections. ``We have to reach as many people as possible,''
Jackson said, ``and let them buy in whatever way they feel
comfortable, be it through the phone, the Web site a catalog,
whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   And even as they view catalogs as a cost-effective way to reach
offline customers, e-tailers are also looking at them as a means to
increase the Web site's traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Take eZiba.com, which sells handmade goods from far-flung
regions of the world. The company plans to begin testing a catalog
this fall with a mailing to 500,000 consumers, according to Bill
Miller, the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, a former executive vice president at F.A.O. Schwarz,
said he would use the catalog primarily to attract customers to the
eZiba Web site. ``Every time we dropped a catalog at F.A.O., we saw
a significant increase in our Web traffic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Catalogs can help create Web site traffic by showing customers a
limited, but enticing, selection of a company's overall merchandise
offerings, executives said. And because a Web order is less
expensive to process than a phone-based order, companies frequently
offer discounts or free shipping to draw customers to their sites.
</P>
<P>
   EZiba has more reason than many other e-tailers to use catalogs
as a device for generating Web traffic, rather than mainly a
vehicle for direct sales, Miller said. Because eZiba's business
involves selling goods with limited availability, the company
cannot stock enough items to support an extensive catalog mailed to
tens of millions of consumers. EZiba will ship a catalog with a
limited number of items that will be well-stocked, in case
consumers order those items in droves.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, at least, Internet merchants are nicely positioned to
produce a catalog at low cost. Many e-tailers already have plenty
of product descriptions and high-resolution digital photographs of
merchandise on hand, as well as in-house creative directors with
experience in print publishing.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Web retailers who have initiated catalog efforts say
incremental production costs are minimal. But executives said that
to market a catalog successfully, companies must overcome far more
difficult, and potentially expensive, hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Inventory management, as Miller noted, can be a huge issue.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Tom Bazzone, president of RedEnvelope.com, an online gifts
retailer that began selling through catalogs in February, said
merchants that did not properly manage inventory during a catalog
mailing risked either alienating customers with sold-out items, or
burying their warehouses in unsold merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   For most catalogs, he said, 75 to 80 percent of the sales occur
within 40 days of the mailing. As a result, many catalog operations
engage in what is called ``slotting,'' or staggering their order
volumes with suppliers. So instead of ordering 1,000 items from a
vendor, they would arrange to receive 300 initially, have another
300 delivered two weeks after the catalog is shipped, and then have
the option of either receiving or canceling the remaining items,
depending on sales.
</P>
<P>
   The process is even more complicated for Web retailers, he said,
because the same items sell at different rates through the
different channels. ``It can get very hairy,'' Bazzone said.
</P>
<P>
   Developing an effective mailing list is no snap either,
executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies must know their audience well enough to cite specific
customer demographics when they approach so-called list brokers,
who typically sell names and addresses of prospective customers for
$100 to $125 per thousand. And once the first mailing goes out,
merchants must have the personnel and technology in place to
analyze the response rates, so they can fine-tune subsequent
mailings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes Direct Marketing 101 from there,'' said Cindy
Marshall, director of marketing for eZiba.com.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for dot-coms, the course requirements for Direct
Marketing 101 also include a large section on customer service _ an
area of study that many e-tailers seemed to have slept through in
previous semesters. H. Robert Wientzen, president of the Direct
Marketing Association, an industry trade group, said Internet
merchants ``need to have real customer service when it comes to a
catalog, because customers expect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, he said, that requires substantial investment in
phone-based customer-service representatives. ``And it's probably
too late for some companies who are cash poor to make enough of an
investment in customer service to make it work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Internet companies that follow the catalog path can take
some solace in the experiences of Bazzone at RedEnvelope. He said
that only 30 percent of the orders generated by the company's
catalogs were taken over the phone. The rest, he said, came via the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Orton, senior vice president for business development at
Food.com, which delivers take-out food for 16,000 restaurants
around the country, said she hoped the company's coming catalog
effort would, like RedEnvelope.com, yield far more Web orders than
phone orders. Because the company already takes large numbers of
orders over the phone, Orton said she was not concerned about the
effect a catalog might have on customer service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see the catalog as a way to migrate people from the phone
to the online experience,'' she said. For instance, Orton said that
in a recent survey 68 percent of the customers who had ordered over
the phone said they would prefer to use the Internet. ``So we see
this as a great opportunity for us.''

ADVERTISING: CUSTOM COSMETICS AND `RELATIONSHIP MARKETING' ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A high-profile entrant in one of the most crowded categories of
e-commerce is hoping to gain a competitive edge with a campaign
that plays up what are deemed to be its beautiful points of
differentiation.
</P>
<P>
   Reflect.com LLC, formed by the household products giant Procter
&AMP; Gamble and two venture capital funds, is introducing
quirky-looking print advertisements that seek to gain attention for
_ and drive traffic to _ its Web site (www.reflect.com). The site
sells the lotions and potions that have long been emblematic of the
beauty products business, from makeup and fragrances to skin creams
and shampoos.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that merchandise is also being sold online by
companies like Eve.com, Gloss.com, Ibeauty.com and Sephora.com. And
those goods were being sold by online retailers that have already
become casualties of the dot-com downturn, among them Beauty.com,
Beautyscene.com and Jasmin.com.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Reflect.com and its agency of record, Deutsch Inc.
in New York, hope to distinguish the newcomer from its rivals by
stressing the customized products sold at the site, which are, as
the saying goes, not available in stores. The merchandise is
blended to order based on answers to questions asked of women who
visit the site and is even shipped to them in packages labeled with
their names.
</P>
<P>
   That customization _ underlined by the theme of the campaign,
``Active ingredient: You'' _ is indicative of the increasing
emphasis on relationship marketing by Internet advertisers. They
are placing more importance on turning consumers into customers,
particularly as it becomes more difficult and expensive to prospect
for computer users who have still not visited their sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view ourselves as a beauty brand that is Internet-enabled
instead of an Internet brand of beauty care products,'' said
Richard Gerstein, vice president for marketing and design at
Reflect.com in San Francisco, which was started by P &AMP; G in
September along with Institutional Venture Partners and Redpoint
Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really happy to see the dot-com shakeout,'' Gerstein
said. ``It allows our business model to rise to the top. Owning
your own brand allows you to be funded and make money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of inexperienced people with too much money
getting bad advice,'' he added, referring to the general e-commerce
field. ``They focused on building awareness, not long-term brand
equity, and didn't give consumers a reason to stick with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for women to glue themselves to Reflect.com,
according to the campaign, is its ability to provide what are
described as ``one-of-a-kind'' products ``that don't exist until
you help create them.'' The print ads use low-key humor,
underscored with whimsical drawings by an illustrator, Trisha
Krauss, to express that thought.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, one ad asserts, ``It's not magic, it's
interactive.'' Another ad declares: ``Supermodels are under
contract. They have to wear certain products. You, luckily, are
free to create your own.'' An ad under development tentatively
carries this headline: ``For years, women have been told what they
need. Maybe it's time for you to tell us.''
</P>
<P>
   Liz Gumbinner, vice president and group creative director at
Deutsch, which joined the Procter agency roster in October with the
Reflect.com assignment, called the understated approach deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we said `It's a revolution in beauty care,' people wouldn't
believe it, because they've been hearing that their whole lives,''
Gumbinner said. ``It's like airline advertising; you're stuck on a
runway for six hours with nothing but peanuts and that's what
people remember, not the beautiful skies.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most visible aspect of the unconventional approach
the campaign takes is how the drawings depict the Reflect.com
customers. They are far more ``real-looking'' than women typically
are in pitches for beauty products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a challenge to the way the beauty industry portrays
women, on a pedestal,'' Gerstein said. ``We're not suggesting you
have to be a perfect, touched-up person, which is where we think
the future is, allowing women to focus on what's right for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam M. Levine, executive vice president and brand director at
Deutsch, noted that there was a deliberately ``unfinished quality
to all the illustrations,'' which were painted by Krauss on
plywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way, it's easier for women to project themselves into the
ads,'' Levine said, ``which is also a way to get at the
interactivity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Women still have that hope there can be, will be, something
better out there,'' he added, ``and they will try things.''
</P>
<P>
   To capitalize on that quality among consumers whom Levine
labeled as ``beauty-involved,'' the ads will appear in magazines
with a beauty and fashion editorial focus like Allure,
Cosmopolitan, Elle, Essence, Glamour, In Style, Mademoiselle, Marie
Claire, Self, Shape and Vogue. The ads will also run in
publications like Entertainment Weekly and People.
</P>
<P>
   The budget for the campaign is $3 million to $5 million for the
third quarter. The work by Deutsch is in addition to a campaign
created by the interactive agency of record for Reflect.com,
Critical Mass in Calgary, Alberta, half owned by Rapp Collins
Worldwide in New York, part of the Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp Collins had been handling direct marketing duties for the
site, but Gerstein said that he was ``no longer working with'' that
agency and was instead producing direct mail ``using the Deutsch
creative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we have a campaign women have told us they love,'' he
added, ``we are starting to integrate it into other elements of our
program.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as that great philosopher, Madonna, once said, ``Beauty's
where you find it.''

HEINZ'S GREEN KETCHUP TARGETS CHILDREN TO BOLSTER SALES GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>
   By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move to raise sales of its ketchup, H.J. Heinz plans to
introduce a new version Monday that will be bright green and is
intended to appeal to children.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous focus-group sessions with about 1,000 children led
company executives to conclude that ketchup in a new color would
encourage its more liberal use on food. In addition to the green
ketchup, Heinz has also come up with a curvaceous bottle in plastic
it says is softer and easier for children to squeeze. The nozzle
emits a fine stream, compared with previous containers, enabling
children to write their names on their food or play Jackson Pollock
_ parents permitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's empowered them in a way that they have always desired but
haven't had an opportunity, until now,'' said Deb Magness, a Heinz
spokeswoman. ``It's a ketchup they can call their own.''
</P>
<P>
   The ketchup, called EZ Squirt, is fortified with Vitamin C and
will start appearing in stores in October, she said. Despite the
color, the vitamins and the packaging, ``there is no taste
difference,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   With sales of packaged food showing little growth over the last
several years, companies are trying all sorts of strategies to get
their businesses to grow. While new products can increase sales, at
least in the short run, many analysts believe Heinz is likely to
acquire another company so that it can become larger and more
diversified. In addition to ketchup, Heinz also makes pet food,
tuna fish, pickles, private-label soup and other products.
</P>
<P>
   A wave of consolidation during the last three months has paired
Bestfoods with Unilever, and Nabisco with Philip Morris, increasing
the pressure on smaller companies like Heinz to eventually combine
forces with others so that they can be forceful players in the
global supermarket business.

 &HT;    Where have you gone, Jackie Robinson?
 &HT;    By Israel Gutierrez
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When Buck O'Neil was playing for the Kansas
City Monarchs of the Negro Leagues in the 1930s and 1940s, the love
for baseball spilled over onto the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Famer O'Neil, teammate of Hall of Fame pitcher
Satchel Paige, remembers watching black children in the city
neighborhoods playing stickball, imagining themselves as the next
Paige or O'Neil.
</P>
<P>
   For years before and years after Jackie Robinson broke Major
League Baseball's color barrier in 1947, baseball was the sport of
choice for America's black youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``All kids played baseball during that time,'' said O'Neil, who
broke the major-league coaching color barrier when he took a
position with the Cubs in 1962. ``Their daddies before them played
baseball. It might have been semipro teams, but everybody played
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time, that was more or less the only outlet for the
black kid _ baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward six decades. Pittsburgh Pirates first baseman Kevin
Young believes Robinson would be disappointed if he saw the racial
makeup of baseball today.
</P>
<P>
   Young and Adrian Brown are the only black players on the
Pirates' 25-man roster. It's a ratio that's become common in
baseball at every level.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have so many Latin players, and their dark skin kind of
makes everybody go, 'Oh, there they (the black players) are,' ''
Young said. ``But you look at our team, and it's me and Adrian
Brown and that's it. And then you have five other Latin players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt you notice that from team to team. It's very
rare now to see a team with four African-American players on it.
It's definitely something that's on the decline and is trying to be
addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of black players in Major League Baseball dropped
to 15 percent in 1998, the lowest percentage of the decade,
according to the Center for the Study of Sport in Society at
Northeastern University. By comparison, the percentage of Latin
players reached an all-time high (25 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of black players on rosters still hovers around
15 percent this season. In 1959, when Pumpsie Green joined the
Boston Red Sox, the last team to integrate its roster, the
percentage was 17.9. In 1980, the number reached 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But 53 years after Robinson, the numbers are on the decline,
prompting concerns about the sport's future with blacks, and asking
the question, ``Why the disinterest?'' At least one former
major-leaguer wonders if the future of the league will look more
like the pre-Robinson days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over history, (blacks) have been excellent players. You want
this to continue,'' said Monte Irvin, who was originally chosen to
break baseball's color barrier but was delayed until 1949 by
military service and health problems. ``You don't want to go to a
game and not see any African-American representatives. The way it's
going, in another 20 years there might not be any. I'd hate to see
that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   While the number of black athletes in basketball and football
also are slipping slightly, the dwindling numbers in those sports
still don't compare to baseball. According to the Northeastern
study, blacks make up nearly 70 percent of professional football
rosters and the number reaches 80 percent in basketball.
</P>
<P>
   So how did baseball reach this point? The answer lies in the
inner cities and with today's youth.
</P>
<P>
   BASKETBALL, FOOTBALL DOMINATE
</P>
<P>
   When O'Neil visits those same neighborhoods where he once saw
stickball played in the streets, he now sees packed basketball
courts and football in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Puerto Rico, Cuba and places like that, it's the same thing
as it was in the inner city when Jackie went in,'' O'Neil said.
``Everybody wanted to play baseball. 'This is my way to get out of
here.' Right now, they've got so many different ways to get out of
the ghetto than they had in my time. Baseball, that was your way
out.''
</P>
<P>
   If athletics is the chosen path, they now gravitate toward the
sports that better promote black players, said Richard Lapchick, a
sports sociologist and author of the Northeastern study.
</P>
<P>
   Even after his retirement, Michael Jordan is a more prominent
television figure than any black baseball star. During his playing
days, Jordan was the poster child of the NBA and played the role of
athletic icon and role model to near perfection. It's an aspect
clearly lacking in Major League Baseball promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. probably is the most marketable black superstar
in baseball, yet baseball has not taken full advantage of his
marketability, Lapchick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It caught on a little bit, but not the way that Jordan was
marketed,'' Lapchick said. ``Jordan was clearly the greatest player
of his generation, but a lot of baseball people argued that Griffey
also was but wasn't even close to being marketed that way. I think
they could have done something with it.''
</P>
<P>
   If baseball would have taken a cue from the NBA, the sport could
have more budding black stars like Marlins center fielder Preston
Wilson, even though he too was caught up in Jordan-mania.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson called basketball his ``first love,'' and never seriously
considered baseball until high school, an interest that may never
have developed if not for his family ties to the sport _ Wilson's
stepfather Mookie Wilson played 12 major-league seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while there, Jordan was all everybody saw,'' said
Wilson, 25, one of six black players on the current Marlins roster.
``That was pretty big to see Michael Jordan. Everybody wanted to
play like Jordan. Everybody wanted to take Mike's moves. When you
look at the number of blacks that used to play baseball in the past
decades and how big the sport was for blacks, to see that there
aren't that many playing now, you really have to wonder what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   From Little League teams to high school teams to college teams,
the trend is noticeable. Of the 5,796 athletes who received some
NCAA scholarship aid in baseball during the 1997-98 academic year,
only 376 (6.5 percent) were African-American.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally black colleges such as Florida A&AMP;M and
Bethune-Cookman fill their baseball rosters with whites or Latins
because not enough blacks are interested. Inner-city high schools
across the country are doing away with their baseball programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is looked down upon, at least where I come from,''
said Ron Calloway, a Jupiter Hammerheads outfielder who went to
high school in San Jose, Calif. ``I guess there are some places
where baseball is the thing to do, but it wasn't like that at my
school.''
</P>
<P>
   HIRING PRACTICES QUESTIONED
</P>
<P>
   Lapchick says there's another factor _ Major League Baseball's
hiring practice.
</P>
<P>
   There are no black general managers in the majors and just four
black managers, and minority hiring is a controversial topic that
comes up almost every off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents and families of color have a perspective that is far
different than white families, in that white families don't have to
think about those things because (whites) get those opportunities
irrespective of the color of their skin,'' Lapchick said. ``If
you're a person of color, that is very much a factor of everything
that happens in your life. That's a perspective that parents are
going to communicate to their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has recognized the problem and Commissioner Bud Selig
now requires teams to submit a list of candidates for manager and
front-office positions to make sure minorities are considered.
Lapchick called Selig's decision ``one of the most important things
a commissioner has done about this issue (of race), ever.''
</P>
<P>
   John Young helped institute a more grass-roots solution. In
1989, he founded RBI (Reviving Baseball in Inner cities), a program
that sponsors baseball leagues in inner cities.
</P>
<P>
   Young began the program in Los Angeles, but it has since
expanded into 137 cities worldwide. This year, 10 RBI participants
were selected in baseball's amateur draft.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Brasuell, RBI's director, said the target is not only
black children, but any youths who would not normally be able to
afford the costs of equipment for a Little League team.
</P>
<P>
   But 59 percent of RBI participants are black, a much higher
number than the percentage currently playing the sport in college
or professionally.
</P>
<P>
   Marlins reliever Vic Darensbourg coached in an RBI league in
California and noticed most of the children still favored the more
fast-paced sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun and hectic at the same time,'' Darensbourg said.
``A few of them had a heart for the game. Most of them, they'd
rather play basketball or football.''
</P>
<P>
   Marlins pitcher Chuck Smith acknowledges RBI's success, but
still would like to personally reach out to the inner cities to
find baseball talent. It's how he discovered his own talent.
</P>
<P>
   Smith grew up on the east side of Cleveland in the projects of
Garden Valley, where his father volunteered to coach a city youth
team made up of Rainbow Terrace Projects residents.
</P>
<P>
   That team folded after one year, but Smith and some teammates
went on to another team in the same city league, this one run by
former Negro Leagues player Johnny Rosco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a separated city,'' Smith said. ``You've got your whites
on the west side and you've got your blacks on the east side. So
when we played the city championship it was black against white. We
dominated the city of Cleveland for years.''
</P>
<P>
   That domination made Smith believe in his baseball abilities. So
when he sees the dwindling numbers of blacks playing baseball, he
uses his Cleveland days as an example of the untapped potential in
the inner cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like they go to the Dominican Republic and Venezuela to
get the talent from over there, there's just as much talent in the
city, you've just got to find it,'' Smith said. ``Baseball isn't
giving those areas enough attention to realize how much talent is
coming out of there. There's so many kids that could be saved. I'm
not saying baseball should try to save people, but there's a lot of
talent that could be given a chance.''

 &HT;    Dry summer makes for thirsty bugs
 &HT;    By Jen Sansbury
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bugged out by watering restrictions?
</P>
<P>
   So are the bugs.
</P>
<P>
   As state and local governments limit outdoor sprinkler time,
homeowners tend to focus their efforts on watering lawns and plants
closest to their houses. By doing that, they end up attracting more
household pests, said Steve Arnold, owner of Atlanta's Peachtree
Pest Control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insects move in as close to the structures as they can get
because that's the only place they can usually find water,'' Arnold
said. ``The drought does the same thing for insects as it does for
people. It gets hot and they go find a place to cool off.''
</P>
<P>
   Ants in particular may head indoors for a drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually they'll make an entrance through a crack or crevice in
the bathroom or kitchen,'' said Winston Eason, a county
agricultural extension agent. ``You can expect it almost every
summer but usually we see a lot more of it when we have very dry
summers, mostly when people aren't able to water.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that ants like to take their food
underground, let it mold and then feed off it, said Don Chesney, an
exterminator at Elite Pest Control. When the ground is dry, it
disrupts the process and stirs up the ants.
</P>
<P>
   Chesney said the increase in ants coming indoors is simply a
function of a growing ant population engaging in typical summertime
habits.
</P>
<P>
   But Arnold said the dry conditions are affecting all kinds of
critters, from crickets and spiders to millipedes and roly-poly
pillbugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These insects are water dependent and are more apt to move
into those areas where water is more readily available, from a
leaky faucet to an irrigation system keeping your plants alive,''
Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   Pets may help bring more bugs inside as well, Eason said, from
ticks that thrive in warm weather to ants making a bee-line for the
water bowl on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are first and foremost attracted to water,'' he said.
``If food is there they will go ahead and help themselves to that,
too. The cat food will be a little bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold said the drought actually creates year-round bug issues.
If the healthier plants are closest to the house or even inside, so
are the insects that feed off the leaves, like leafhoppers,
caterpillars and aphids. They, in turn, lure the bugs that eat
them, such as ladybugs, spiders and earwigs. Some will then
``overwinter,'' or hibernate, inside.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the ladybugs that seemed to be getting inside
your house during the spring may actually have hatched there and
were trying to get out, Arnold said. So expect to see them again
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to have more problems every year the drought
continues,'' he said. ``They're going to utilize our homes as a way
of surviving.''
</P>
<P>
   TIPS ON BATTLING INDOOR BUG INVASIONS
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep your house clean.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seal cracks around your home, including places where plumbing
pipes and telephone and cable wiring enter the building.
</P>
<P>
   _ Trim trees so that limbs don't touch your house.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep mulch shallow, no more than 2 inches, near the foundation
of your house.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make sure air conditioning condensation lines lead away from
the house.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep dryer hoses and vents clean and aimed outside.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you have a crawlspace under your house, make sure vent
louvres are open, to allow warm, moist air to escape, and there's a
tight, mesh screen to help keep insects out.

DEBATE OVER TAX CUTS IS SHIFTING TO SPECIFICS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With projections of the federal budget surplus
rising and both parties in full election-year mode, the debate over
tax cuts is shifting from whether to what kinds.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans continue to press for bigger reductions than most
Democrats will support, but in Washington and on the campaign
trail, Democrats from President Clinton on down are joining
Republicans in backing tax cuts _ enthusiastically in some cases,
grudgingly and with conditions in others _ to a far greater degree
than they were a year or even six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore doubled his proposed tax-cutting package
a few weeks ago, to $500 billion over 10 years, moving him closer
to the $1.3 trillion plan offered by his Republican rival for the
presidency, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton announced recently that he would agree to a $250
billion, 10-year tax cut for married couples on Republican terms if
Congress would pass his plan to add prescription-drug coverage to
the Medicare system of health insurance for the elderly and
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The new dynamics of tax cutting will be on display in Congress
this week when the Senate takes up the two big tax-cutting bills of
the year: the repeal of the federal estate tax, and the proposal to
reduce taxes on nearly all married couples in the name of
eliminating the ``marriage penalty,'' the quirk in the tax code
that leaves some two-income couples paying a bigger tax bill than
they would if they had remained single.
</P>
<P>
   On the estate-tax repeal, the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott
of Mississippi, thinks he may be able to attract enough support
from Democrats to overcome two 60-vote procedural hurdles and force
a final vote on the bill this week. If they can get past those
hurdles, Republicans are all but assured of passing the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a third of the Democrats in the House broke ranks with
the party last month and voted to repeal the estate tax, long one
of the Republicans' top priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, identical with the version passed last month by
the House, would gradually reduce and eventually eliminate the tax,
which applies only to estates valued at $675,000 or more, a
threshold that is already scheduled to rise to $1 million by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has made clear that Clinton would veto the bill.
But Republicans say that just passing the legislation with
bipartisan support would be a powerful political symbol of
opposition to the tax, and they have not ruled out bringing the
bill up again later this year as part of an end-of-the-year budget
package.
</P>
<P>
   For years it was Democratic orthodoxy to label repeal of the
estate tax a giveaway to the very richest people in the country.
But to try to reduce defections from their ranks and display their
own tax-cutting credentials, Democrats in the Senate are planning
to offer a less expensive alternative proposal on the estate tax,
as their counterparts in the House did last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic proposal is expected to call for the effective
elimination of the tax for two politically powerful constituencies
that claim to be hard hit by it _ small business owners and family
farms _ but to continue to impose the tax at reduced rates on the
very largest of estates.
</P>
<P>
   Lott also plans to bring up the marriage-penalty bill by the end
of the week under a procedure that would keep Democrats from
stalling or loading the bill with a lot of amendments. The bill,
which would cut taxes on married couples by $248 billion over 10
years, is larger than a version passed earlier this year by the
House.
</P>
<P>
   As with the estate tax, Democrats plan to offer a less expensive
alternative. It would seek to eliminate the marriage penalty
without giving a tax cut to couples who already receive a marriage
bonus _ that is, a lower tax bill than they would pay if they had
remained single.
</P>
<P>
   Since Republicans have shown no signs of accepting his proposal
to swap a tax cut for the prescription-drug coverage plan, Clinton
is likely to veto the marriage-penalty bill if it passes. But
Republicans said they would nonetheless be able to go to their
party convention at the end of the month and tell voters that they
had done their part to enact big tax cuts _ and that it was a
Democrat in the White House who blocked them.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts think the two parties will remain stalemated on
fiscal policy as long as control of Congress and the White House
remains divided. Others are more optimistic about a compromise on
tax cuts, perhaps even this year, because there is enough money for
both parties to get what they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a question of horse trading at this point,'' said
Bruce Bartlett, a fellow at the National Center for Policy
Analysis, a conservative research group.
</P>
<P>
   But the supercharged politics of the campaign season will make
it difficult for any tax cuts to be enacted before a new president
and Congress take office next year.
</P>
<P>
   The muddled outlook reflects in part the uncertainty in both
parties about how much demand there is among voters for tax cuts.
And the evolving politics of tax cuts are just one illustration of
how the fast-increasing surplus projections are forcing both
parties to rethink their ideology and tactics on fiscal issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a changing climate on tax cuts,'' said Sen. William
Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Finance Committee. Roth said that the
larger surplus projections, the possibility that the long economic
expansion might be starting to run out of steam, and Clinton's
willingness to negotiate a deal have combined to give tax
reductions new political viability.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also said the rosier fiscal outlook has made tax
cutting more appealing _ or at least made it more difficult
politically to reject all tax cuts out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   But they said tax cuts are getting more bipartisan consideration
because Republicans in Congress have dropped their insistence on
putting forward all-encompassing tax-reduction bills that would use
all or most of the projected surpluses and instead are addressing
specific types of tax cuts one by one.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats generally remain solidly opposed to broad-based
tax-cutting packages of the type proposed by Bush in his
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats have always been willing to consider if not support
tax cuts that are fair, while reflecting our priorities and the
need for sound fiscal management of the surplus,'' said Gene
Sperling, the director of the White House's National Economic
Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has changed is that instead of the Republicans in
Congress offering a single, excessive tax-cut package that could be
rejected immediately as breaking the bank,'' he said, ``they are
now trying to slice their tax agenda into smaller pieces, which can
be individually considered on the basis of fairness, fiscal
prudence and priorities.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the coming week, Democrats plan to hit the Republicans hard
on those points, asserting that the Republican versions of the
estate-tax and marriage-penalty bills are much too expensive and
too tilted to the wealthy. And they intend to make a case that tax
cuts are justifiable only after the two parties agree on more
pressing issues, in particular adding prescription-drug coverage to
Medicare and allocating more of the surplus to reducing the
national debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats believe you can eliminate the marriage penalty and
reduce the estate tax, and at the same time provide Americans with
a prescription-drug benefit,'' said Ranit Schmelzer, communications
director for Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic
leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans just want to do the tax cut,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Roth said that Republicans, too, think there is enough money for
a sizable tax cut, a prescription-drug benefit and steady reduction
of the national debt. And he said that as he travels through his
home state, he finds considerable support among voters for acting
now to repeal the estate tax and cut taxes on couples.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are banking on getting support from Democrats who
are up for re-election this year and do not want to have to explain
their opposition to tax cuts. They point to Democrats like Sen.
Charles Robb of Virginia, who is in a tough race this year in an
anti-tax state and supports repeal of the estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans acknowledge that their party also needs to
be willing to compromise if it wants Clinton to sign any tax cuts
into law, and that if they play politics with the issue they will
be exposed to assertions by Democrats that Republicans have run a
do-nothing Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a strong believer that what people back home want to see
at election time is what you've accomplished,'' said Roth, who is
also locked in a tight re-election race. ``There are some on both
sides who want an issue, not legislation, but I think that's
short-sighted.''

   JEWISH-PRESS-MEDIA (Undated) _ Usually, The New York Jewish Week
newspaper, affiliated with the UJA-Federation, sees its job as
putting the Jewish community in a positive light. And so it was a
remarkable departure for the paper to run an extensive
investigative article recently about a local rabbi, the regional
director of the Orthodox Union's summer youth program, who had been
accused for years of sexual improprieties toward teen-age girls.
After the article appeared, the rabbi was fired, despite his
insistence that the accusations were false. The reaction, within
the metropolitan Jewish community, as well as the regional and
national Jewish press, highlights the tension between advocacy and
objectivity in specialized journalism that is aimed at specific
religious, ethnic or cultural groups. By Felicity Barringer.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Most of a recent front page of The Jewish Week, the largest
Jewish newspaper in the country, had a distinctly uplifting tone:
``Racing to Rescue the Sephardic Past.'' ``Catholic-Jewish Dialogue
Reaches New Heights.'' ``The Jewish Family in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it seemed to fit a newspaper whose subscribers are
mostly regular contributors to the United Jewish Appeal
philanthropy. But one headline was not like the others.
</P>
<P>
   Under the words ``Stolen Innocence,'' the newspaper's editor and
publisher, Gary Rosenblatt, wrote 4,000 words extensively
documenting accusations that a ``brilliant, charismatic and
dynamic'' rabbi in Paramus, N.J., had abused teen-agers in his
charge, emotionally, sexually and physically. The article also
quoted his accusers' contentions that the rabbi, Baruch Lanner, had
been shielded for decades by his superiors in the Union of Orthodox
Jewish Congregations, commonly known as the Orthodox Union, the
most visible national organization in the Orthodox branch of
Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lanner disputes many of the charges, either denying
them or saying that he has no recollection of specific encounters
dating back 20 or more years, his superiors announced, on the day
the article appeared, June 23, that they had accepted Lanner's
resignation as director of regions of the National Conference of
Synagogue Youth. The Orthodox Union, which operates the youth
group, has since appointed an independent commission to investigate
the assertions.
</P>
<P>
   But for some of the 90,000 subscribers of The Jewish Week, most
of whom live in or near New York City, the newspaper and its
editors were the villains. One letter to the editor said, ``You are
giving the families of teens from nonobservant homes the
opportunity to completely remove their children from anything that
has to do with Torah.''
</P>
<P>
   Like reporters and editors at other publications devoted to
religious groups or secular causes, observant Jewish journalists
like Rosenblatt are dual citizens of sometimes conflicting worlds.
They pledge allegiance to the imperatives of an aggressive press.
They also believe in a mission _ in this case, celebrating Jewish
life and abiding by Jewish law, one of whose tenets discourages
``lashon hara,'' or malicious gossip, even if the gossip is true.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first commandment of a journalist is to probe, uncover,
explore,'' Rosenblatt said. ``The first commandment in the Jewish
organizational world is pretty much the opposite: to present the
united front. `We are one.' That crystallizes the dilemma.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jacobs, the editor of The Baltimore Jewish Times and a
former protege of Rosenblatt, said: ``When I started working with
Gary in 1982 we used to kid each other that there was an 11th
commandment. No. 11 was Thou Shalt Not Air Thy Dirty Laundry. What
we found then was that if you read the Jewish press, Jews were
perfect people. They never got AIDS; they never did drugs; they
never beat their wives.''
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, however, Jewish newspapers became comfortable with
uncomfortable information. ``I did a cover on these Orthodox teens
_ how they were heavily into ecstasy and all kinds of drugs,''
Jacobs said, recalling an article from last fall. ``I was told that
if that story runs in The Baltimore Jewish Times, you will become
persona non grata in the Orthodox community.'' After publication,
he recalled: ``Some people canceled their subscriptions. Some
people said it was sensationalist. It was lashon hara, they said.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs' experience is not unusual. For The Detroit Jewish News,
a recent flashpoint was a report on declining enrollment at a local
religious day school. For The Jewish Journal, in Los Angeles, it
was a mid-1990s report on the heavy staffing and overhead costs of
a leading charity. For The Chicago Jewish News, there were
accusations of money laundering at a kosher restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, a news service to which
nearly 100 Jewish newspapers subscribe, ran a five-part series on
sexual misconduct entitled ``When Rabbis Go Astray.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It ran during the High Holidays,'' Lisa Hostein, the editor of
the news service, said last week. And she recalled the typical
response: ``How could you, at this time, be writing about such a
terrible thing?''
</P>
<P>
   Such a sense of possession of the Jewish press perhaps reflects
many of the newspapers' financial ties to Jewish philanthropy.
Though Jewish papers in cities like Baltimore, Detroit and Atlanta
are independently owned, others, including those in Los Angeles and
New York, have direct ties to various regional federations of the
United Jewish Appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish Week charges its 30,000 direct subscribers $36 to $41
annually, depending on where they live; 60,000 more get
subscriptions by giving $36 or more to the United Jewish Appeal.
Still, Rosenblatt emphasizes the pledge of The Jewish Times that it
is ``an independent community newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   His lean face creased with a worried frown, Rosenblatt sorted
through sheaves of mail last week in his corner office in Times
Square. Almost all dealt with the issues posed by article about
Lanner.
</P>
<P>
   Even the rabbi's detractors agree that his magnetic, eclectic
intelligence drew teen-agers to him, and sometimes to a closer
sense of their Jewishness. Some accusers acknowledge his charisma
but told Rosenblatt that the rabbi's actions had driven them from
Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt did not succeed in persuading the rabbi to comment
for the investigative article. Both Rosenblatt and Lanner said last
week that Rosenblatt called the rabbi about six days before the
publication of the article and offered three dates for an
interview. Lanner, declining to be interviewed alone, said he
sought to postpone the interview until a chosen witness could
accompany him. Although Rosenblatt said he had explained there was
a deadline, the rabbi said he had not known that by postponing the
meeting he would lose his chance to comment before publication.
</P>
<P>
   The article went to press quoting, by name, 10 people, most in
their 30s and 40s. They said that, as teen-agers, they had
experienced either violence by the rabbi or sexually aggressive
behavior by him.
</P>
<P>
   In his interview with The New York Times, Lanner went over each
of the assertions, mostly from the 1970s and '80s. Asked about
specifics of seven cases in which he was said to have propositioned
or threatened young girls, including two who said he had struck
them, he said: ``I have no recollection of that'' or ``I don't
remember that.''
</P>
<P>
   As for another incident referred to in the article, Lanner did
acknowledge that, as a high school principal, he had kneed a male
student in the groin. But he said it was an inadvertent result of
``horseplay.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The absence of action against Lanner over the years by leaders
of the Orthodox Union was perhaps the most inflammatory part of the
Jewish Week article. ``What upsets me the most,'' Dr. Mel Isaacs of
the Hebrew Academy of Nassau County said in a letter to the editor,
``is the lack of response by those in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mandell Ganchrow, a retired surgeon who is president of the
Orthodox Union, said last week that he could not discuss specifics
until the newly appointed commission had finished its
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish Week and New York's other two Jewish newspapers, The
Forward and The Jewish Press, ``have a function and for the most
part they perform well,'' Ganchrow said. ``Sometimes they
sensationalize.'' But, he said, ``The author and editor _ they
really have to weigh the harm versus the benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lanner article reported that as the publication date neared,
Rosenblatt was approached by various community leaders arguing
against printing it. Rosenblatt, who is an Orthodox Jew, said that
before publishing he had consulted an expert in Jewish law to help
decide if the piece would constitute lashon hara. He said he was
told that sometimes the need to protect individuals can outweigh
the prohibition of malicious gossip.
</P>
<P>
   Though the response to the article has been largely supportive,
he said, some high-profile figures have been openly critical.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Basil Herring of the Jewish Center of Atlantic Beach, on
Long Island, contends that the 100-year-old Orthodox Union _ which,
aside from its other programs, officially certifies packaged and
canned commercial foods as kosher _ could be damaged by the
accusations, as could its active youth division.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Herring said he believed ``there are
already voices being raised in synagogues to withhold support, to
consider withdrawal'' from the Orthodox Union. ``I've even heard
this go so far as to talk about their kosher standards,'' the rabbi
added.
</P>
<P>
   The proper course, Herring suggested, would have been for
Rosenblatt to present his reporting to Orthodox Union leaders and
say that unless they removed Lanner from work with young people,
the article would be published. ``The fact that they did fire the
man'' as the article was being printed ``indicates that they would
have done so if the facts had been known beforehand,'' Herring
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt responded that the approach sounded like extortion,
not journalism. ``It's part of our job to deal with real issues
that are out there, even if others aren't willing to confront
them,'' he said. ``We're urging the community to confront the real
issues.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The low humidity that has enveloped the Northeast and Middle
Atlantic States recently will yield to stickier conditions on
Monday as breezes from the southwest deliver sultry air to the
region. Scattered thunderstorms will accompany the return of humid
weather, but some sunshine is also expected.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of heavy thunderstorms will occur near the southern
Great Lakes and Ohio Valley as a cool front intercepts sultry air.
The Southeast will stay partly cloudy and humid with afternoon
thunderstorms in a few locations.
</P>
<P>
   Excessive heat will rule the southern Plains and Texas again as
temperatures surpass 100 degrees in some places. In the West,
afternoon storms will erupt in the southern Rockies where uneven
heating of the complex terrain promotes rising currents of
moistened air.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: LINE OF FIRE
</P>
<P>
   Recurrent thunderstorms brought 10 inches of rain to parts of
northern Wisconsin over the weekend. Steady high-level winds from
the northwest repeatedly steered thunderstorms through the upper
Midwest. This corridor for traveling thunderstorms has been
anchored from the Dakotas to the Great Lakes recently, because the
large-scale wind pattern that is responsible for steering weather
systems has been stagnant. A small change of the high-level wind
pattern early this week will cause the firing line of storms to
shift south to the Ohio Valley and the Middle Atlantic States.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three years ago, Bill Bolster, still new to the
president's job at CNBC, announced an ambitious dream: His
financial news network would beat CNN, then the dominant news
provider on cable, in the cable TV ratings war.
</P>
<P>
   Though it seemed at the time a distant, almost improbable goal,
two weeks ago Bolster achieved it. New Nielsen Media Research data
showed that for the first time in its 11-year history, CNBC had
averaged a higher daily audience than CNN for a three-month period.
</P>
<P>
   In short, CNBC had become the highest-rated news and information
network on cable television, ending CNN's long reign and cementing
its reputation as a leading media organization of the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   For Bolster, 56, the ratings represent a crowning victory in a
35-year career in broadcasting. Although he is widely described as
a tyrannical bully who often offends colleagues, he is admired as a
TV genius gifted not only at packaging and promoting programming
but also at selling it to advertisers at top dollar.
</P>
<P>
   But despite his status as king of TV financial news, Bolster is
more a product of Main Street than of Wall Street _ a media mogul
who is far from media-ready.
</P>
<P>
   Bolster, who is 6 feet 4 inches tall and hulking, has spent most
of his career in local markets out of the glare of the national
spotlight, making him an unlikely leader for a network noted for
having made financial news interesting to everyday people around
the country. CNBC is now a regular fixture not only in brokerage
houses and newsrooms, but also in gyms and bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the market has gone up, and in some ways become, at its
worst, the national lottery, CNBC has grown right along with it,''
said Tom Wolzien, a media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.
``They're part of the democratization of the stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolster is credited both inside and outside his organization
with making CNBC a highly profitable entity with mass appeal by
incorporating some of the flashy graphics and hype associated with
local television news while applying some of the bare-knuckled
sales tactics emblematic of local markets.
</P>
<P>
   Under his tenure, CNBC's ad rates have risen more than
threefold, and profits have more than doubled, executives said.
CNBC, which does not break out its financial results separately
from its parent, General Electric, estimates that it will end the
year with $280 million in profit.
</P>
<P>
   Bolster first learned about sales, he said, from his father,
William, who owned Sweeney's, a women's ready-to-wear business in
Waterloo, Iowa, and who also had an investment in Black Hawk
Broadcasting, which started out as a small radio group. As a
teen-ager, he would help his father with the books.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where I learned the fundamentals of business,'' Bolster
said during an interview at CNBC headquarters in Fort Lee, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he did not become hooked on broadcasting until after
college, when he became an announcer and ad salesman at KDTH radio
in Dubuque, Iowa. He later moved to Waterloo' KWWL-TV, which was
owned by Black Hawk, working up to general manager before moving in
1983 to KSDK-TV, the NBC affiliate in St. Louis, as general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Bolster produced major victories during his time in local
television. KSDK was the No. 3 station in St. Louis when Bolster
arrived. He brought it to first place in two years with heavy
promotions; an early-morning local news program, which was the
first in St. Louis; and an afternoon talk show, ``The Sally Jesse
Raphael Show.''
</P>
<P>
   As head of the news committee of the NBC network's affiliates
board, he helped persuade the network in 1991 to delay the
beginning of ``The Tonight Show'' by five minutes, so stations
would have more ad time to sell during their late newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   Bolster arrived in New York as a virtual unknown in late 1991,
as the general manager of the local NBC station, WNBC-TV, and
scored early ratings victories by heavily using promotions,
starting the city's first early-morning local news program and
introducing flourishes like a news helicopter and high-technology
weather radar.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of his competitors were saying, `Who is this guy from St.
Louis?' '' said Tony Guida, now an anchor with CNNfn who was at
WNBC when Bolster arrived. ``He just cleaned their clocks. He knew
how to market and sell TV better than anyone I've ever worked
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Guida added, ``And I say that grudgingly because there is no
love lost between us.''
</P>
<P>
   Guida is one many on-air people and broadcasting executives who
say they have clashed with Bolster, and who use the phrase ``bull
in a china shop'' to describe him.
</P>
<P>
   He is said to have a propensity for making off-color remarks and
riding people extremely hard. ``He is coarse, impolitic, boorish _
a bully,'' said Peter W. Barnes, a former CNBC reporter now working
for a new financial news Web site, JAGfn.com. Barnes said he had
clashed with Bolster when he tried to break his contract a few
months early and was refused.
</P>
<P>
   Bolster describes himself as one to speak his mind but says that
he does not intend to offend. ``If I've done something,
uncharacteristically, that offends on a very personal basis _ not
professionally, because professionally, that's my job _ I've got to
go back and say I'm sorry, I'm wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly his business manner is full speed ahead. Upon his
arrival at CNBC in 1996 Bolster quickly began making changes.
</P>
<P>
   Within two weeks, he had changed the CNBC logo, incorporating
the NBC peacock. He introduced new wrinkles like real-time stock
quotes and market meters that perpetually run on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   He raised ad rates by arguing to Madison Avenue that he was
delivering a higher-income viewer whom Nielsen could not measure.
To prove it, he gave a real estate firm free time slots advertising
a $3.5 million house in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. There were 400
respondents.
</P>
<P>
   On programming, he and his team approached the stock market as a
big event, a daily Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you say, geez, let's do a pregame show, and it's going to
be `Squawk Box,' '' Bolster said, referring to CNBC's opening-bell
show. ``Then you've got a game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And then, '' he added, ``the post-game show.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for CNBC, once the game is over _ once the main
stock exchanges close for the day _ viewers tend to wander off.
Despite CNBC's daytime gains, its prime-time ratings were down by
about 24 percent this spring compared with last, pulling
significantly smaller audiences than CNN and the Fox News Channel
in the time period.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, executives plan to announce that one nonfinancial
show, ``Upfront Tonight,'' Geraldo Rivera's half-hour news program
weeknights at 7:30, will be replaced by an additional half-hour of
``Business Center.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some debate over how much of CNBC's success belongs to
Bolster, given the public's ravenous appetite for stock market
news. And the network's big name stars like Maria Bartiromo were
there when he arrived.
</P>
<P>
   But media industry executives say that even if Bolster was dealt
a great hand, he has played it masterfully. ``When he first
started, I remember he was saying how he was going to take on CNN
and win, and I thought he was being overly optimistic,'' said Tim
Spengler, senior vice president at Initiative Media, a media buying
firm. ``But he was right. He saw what he had.''

campaign season will make it difficult for any tax cuts to be
enacted before a new president and Congress take office next year.
But in Washington and on the campaign trail, Democrats from

JOHNSON CONTROLS TO MAKE OFFER FOR NISSAN'S CAR-SEAT AFFILIATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Johnson Controls, the auto-parts manufacturer, will
begin a tender offer Monday for the shares of the Ikeda Bussan Co.,
a Nissan Motor Co. affiliate that is best known for making high-end
car seats.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is another strike at the heart of the tightly-knit
cluster of businesses linked to Nissan, which has been dismantling
a cumbersome and costly corporate empire in an effort to return to
financial health.
</P>
<P>
   It may also herald a rush of mergers and acquisitions in Japan's
highly fragmented auto-parts industry.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson Controls, based in Milwaukee, said Sunday that it would
offer 120 yen a share _ equivalent in total to $100 million _ to
buy all the outstanding shares of Ikeda Bussan. It would also
assume $85 million in debt. Shares of Ikeda Bussan closed here
Friday at 118 yen.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies share joint ventures in Europe and the United
States and so are not strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this acquisition will bring positive benefits to
Ikeda Bussan, Nissan and Johnson Controls,'' James Keyes, Johnson's
chairman and chief executive, said in a statement released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan has agreed to sell its 36.9 percent stake in the company
to Johnson, and people close to the negotiations said Johnson had
been negotiating with other big stockholders and was likely to
attract a significant portion of the outstanding shares.
</P>
<P>
   The French automaker Renault, which bought a 37 percent stake in
Nissan last year, has provided impetus for Nissan to slim down.
Ikeda is the latest of Nissan affiliate to be sold, including its
aerospace unit and its stake in Fuji Heavy Industries. Nissan has
raised 100 billion yen, or $935 million, through the sales.
</P>
<P>
   Ikeda Bussan, which had revenue of 134.7 billion yen, or $1.25
billion, in the fiscal year ending in March, has suffered because
of its heavy reliance on Nissan, whose production has fallen amid
declining sales.

   &UR; THE WHEELS OF PROGRESS ARE SPINNING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Nick Diamos  &LR; bought a Mister Magoo video from Amazon.com and
found the following ``explanation'' on the box:
</P>
<P>
   ``The character of Mr. Magoo is in no way intended to demean the
blind or visually impaired. Actually, the near-sighted Magoo is
stubborn: He simply refuses to wear his glasses. The humor comes
not from the bumblings of a myopic senior citizen but from the
wonderfully idiosyncratic creations of his imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   - An East Bay reader notes that the new San Leandro Boy Scouts
headquarters, on Davis Street, is painted a lavender shade of gray.
</P>
<P>
   - Instead of selling the Street News (the New York version of
San Francisco's Street Sheet), subway panhandlers in New York have
been selling copies of the Village Voice, a free weekly. ``These
are new issues,'' said a panhandler quoted in New York magazine,
``they just came out yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Voice managing editor  &UR; Doug Simmons &LR;  said the practice is OK
with the Voice. ``Who's the victim there? As long as it ends up in
the hands of a reader, I don't have any complaint.''
</P>
<P>
   - Ghosts may be lurking in your pockets. ``Couture-crazed New
Yorkers are currently gobbling up vintage clothing,'' writes
 &UR; Simon Doonan  &LR; of the New York Observer, ``with a cavalier and naive
disregard for the paranormal potential lurking in those Puccis and
Guccis. Spirits love a nice bit of schmatte as much as you or I:
Does the phrase `Shroud of Turin' mean anything to you?''
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Marsha Garland &LR;  and  &UR; Danny Leone  &LR; stopped by the Art Van
mobile gallery, parked outside First Thursday art openings in San
Francisco last week, and saw ``Inverted Art,'' all the paintings
having been hung upside-down. Upon entering, gallerygoers were
strapped into a machine that turned them upside-down to see the
art. Leone says he will never be able to ``look at art in the same
old way again.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EDUCATION R US &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - All the modern student needs is a little plastic box with a
screen on top.  &UR; Adrienne Biggs &LR;  saw an L.A. Times ad in which the
school district announced it is auctioning the following obsolete
equipment: printing presses, woodworking tables, engine parts,
lathes, record players, electric and manual typewriters,
projectors, easels, sewing machines, musical instruments, potters'
wheels, a baby grand piano and much more.
</P>
<P>
   _Subversives at the Exploratorium _ whose kitchen bomb-making
instructions scared the Air Force into a recent ban of its Web site
_ are now turning a new generation of Americans into
Travoltas-in-training. Students participating in Science Summer are
learning how to make lava lamps (a jar, vegetable oil, salt, water
and food coloring, and there you go) and disco balls.

   - Following up: Intrigued by mention of sun-dried opossum,
 &UR; Jere Holbrook  &LR; checked out its food values and found the meat
contains a mere 221 calories per 31/2-ounce serving. Even healthier
is muskrat: only 153 calories per same-size serving. And  &UR; John
Kraft  &LR; has found another use for those free CDs from AOL: to
separate frozen hamburger patties.
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Roger Bye &LR;  testifies that the officer he saw driving a San
Francisco police car the other day had a cell phone in one hand and
a cup of coffee in the other. Meanwhile, retiring officer  &UR; Bob &LR; 
 &UR; Geary &LR;  has arranged a fine send-off _ including the Green Street
Mortuary Band, stagecoach and team of four horses _ after he and
his dummy, Brendan O'Smarty, formally retire on Wednesday.
</P>

   - During an American Airlines flight from Cleveland to San
Francisco in first class, a flight attendant offered  &UR; Ben &LR; 
 &UR; Fong-Torres  &LR; a steak. ``Can you make it medium rare?'' he asked.
``I dunno,'' she said with a shrug. ``I just heat 'em up.''
</P>
<P>
   - Actress  &UR; Clea DuVall  &LR; tells Glue magazine about going to
``Saturday Night Live'' to see  &UR; Britney Spears &LR; , who she thought
was ``so cool.'' After the show, she went backstage to meet Spears.
``She didn't care,'' says DuVall. ``She's the biggest star I've
ever met. She was really polite, but she didn't care about us. We
were just like every other person in America going, `Britney!
Britney! We love you!' Really lame, like kids who cry to meet

<P>
   &UR; - Nick Diamos  &LR; bought a Mister Magoo video from Amazon.com and
found the following ``explanation'' on the box:
</P>
<P>
   ``The character of Mr. Magoo is in no way intended to demean the
blind or visually impaired. Actually, the near-sighted Magoo is
stubborn: He simply refuses to wear his glasses. The humor comes
not from the bumblings of a myopic senior citizen but from the
wonderfully idiosyncratic creations of his imagination.''

   - An East Bay reader notes that the new San Leandro Boy Scouts
headquarters, on Davis Street, is painted a lavender shade of gray.
</P>
<P>
   - Instead of selling the Street News (the New York version of
San Francisco's Street Sheet), subway panhandlers in New York have
been selling copies of the Village Voice, a free weekly. ``These
are new issues,'' said a panhandler quoted in New York magazine,
``they just came out yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Voice managing editor  &UR; Doug Simmons &LR;  said the practice is OK
with the Voice. ``Who's the victim there? As long as it ends up in
the hands of a reader, I don't have any complaint.''
</P>
<P>
   - Ghosts may be lurking in your pockets. ``Couture-crazed New
Yorkers are currently gobbling up vintage clothing,'' writes
 &UR; Simon Doonan  &LR; of the New York Observer, ``with a cavalier and naive
disregard for the paranormal potential lurking in those Puccis and
Guccis. Spirits love a nice bit of schmatte as much as you or I:
Does the phrase `Shroud of Turin' mean anything to you?''
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Marsha Garland &LR;  and  &UR; Danny Leone  &LR; stopped by the Art Van
mobile gallery, parked outside First Thursday art openings in San
Francisco last week, and saw ``Inverted Art,'' all the paintings
having been hung upside-down. Upon entering, gallerygoers were
strapped into a machine that turned them upside-down to see the
art. Leone says he will never be able to ``look at art in the same
old way again.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EDUCATION R US &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - All the modern student needs is a little plastic box with a
screen on top.  &UR; Adrienne Biggs &LR;  saw an L.A. Times ad in which the
school district announced it is auctioning the following obsolete
equipment: printing presses, woodworking tables, engine parts,
lathes, record players, electric and manual typewriters,
projectors, easels, sewing machines, musical instruments, potters'
wheels, a baby grand piano and much more.
</P>
<P>
   _Subversives at the Exploratorium _ whose kitchen bomb-making
instructions scared the Air Force into a recent ban of its Web site
_ are now turning a new generation of Americans into
Travoltas-in-training. Students participating in Science Summer are
learning how to make lava lamps (a jar, vegetable oil, salt, water
and food coloring, and there you go) and disco balls.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;

<P>
   - Following up: Intrigued by mention of sun-dried opossum,
 &UR; Jere Holbrook  &LR; checked out its food values and found the meat
contains a mere 221 calories per 31/2-ounce serving. Even healthier
is muskrat: only 153 calories per same-size serving. And  &UR; John

   -  &UR; Roger Bye &LR;  testifies that the officer he saw driving a San
Francisco police car the other day had a cell phone in one hand and
a cup of coffee in the other. Meanwhile, retiring officer  &UR; Bob &LR;

Mortuary Band, stagecoach and team of four horses _ after he and
his dummy, Brendan O'Smarty, formally retire on Wednesday.

``She didn't care,'' says DuVall. ``She's the biggest star I've

TWYLA THARP STRETCHES THE RECIPES FOR TWO STEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ In the entertaining cookbook of recipes from
modern dancers and choreographers just published by the American
Dance Festival here, Twyla Tharp's entry reads as follows: ``Here's
what I can do. Turkey from the deli, sliced. Baked potato, usually
harder than a rock. A banana. Love, Twyla.''
</P>
<P>
   Tharp has always known how to make do in modern dance, a
do-it-yourself art form rooted in individual expression. She
stretches the definition of dance, not just recipes, and her gift
for combining disparate ingredients is embodied in the ferocious
virtuosity that colors the two new Tharp works presented by the
festival from Thursday through Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Energy at its most turbulent erupts throughout ``Surfer at the
Styx'' (to be retitled ``Surfer at the River Styx''), a loose
allegory about two souls battling aspects of themselves and the
Styx (symbolized by a quartet) before they cross into a peaceful
place.
</P>
<P>
   Tharp's vision of heaven and hell takes some time to reveal
itself. John Selya, in white surfer's outfit, and Keith Roberts are
magnificent soloists, clearly tormented onstage by a quartet in
black. But before the work's dramatic meaning snaps fully into
place, the viewer is swept away by the sheer dance power of the
choreography. This is nonstop, fierce bravura, delivered with
mind-boggling stamina from the new company that Tharp has just
formed.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Surfer,'' she has found a perfect collaborator in Donald
Knaack, whose music she used so wittily in a now-celebrated duet
for Ethan Stiefel and Susan Jaffe in her ``Known by Heart'' at
American Ballet Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Knaack, an experimental composer who once worked with John Cage,
as well as with the modern-dance pioneer Bella Lewitzky, meets
Tharp on the same maverick level of energy and rhythm. Known
professionally as the Junkman, he was in the pit on Thursday night
in Page Auditorium at Duke University, the festival's home, playing
an assortment of discarded found objects: hubcaps, a basketball
hoop, a mailbox, pots and pans, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   An electronic tape in the same vein produced by David Kahne, who
composed the coda for the heavenly apotheosis, was channeled into
Knaack's multilevel percussion. Tharp replied with a richly layered
design onstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surfer'' has the impact of Tharp's most exciting and
athletically inclined classics, namely ``The Golden Section'' and
``In the Upper Room.'' It will be an obvious crowd pleaser in the
new company, Twyla Tharp Dance, that made its debut with these
performances.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Mozart Clarinet Quintet K.581,'' the second premiere on
the program and named after its score, shares certain elements with
``Surfer.'' The three men and two women (who are not on toe) look
more classical as the sound of the clarinet floats poetically above
them. Yet in both pieces, Tharp focuses more than ever on novel
ways of partnering. Conventional ballet lifts yield to startling
images. A woman topples head down repeatedly as if dunked into a
vat while her partner holds her by her knees.
</P>
<P>
   Modern dance and ballet are integrated easily in these works.
Without their ballet training, Selya, Roberts, Benjamin Bowman,
Ashley Tuttle and Elizabeth Parkinson would not be so at ease in
the adagio partnering, which is foreign to modern dance. Nor would
Selya and Roberts, both formerly with Ballet Theater, be able to
display the virtuosity that Tharp draws from traditional ballet
bravura. Yet she also uses Francie Huber and Andrew Asnes for their
compelling energy and clarity, qualities they showed with Paul
Taylor's company.
</P>
<P>
   An immediate tension in ``Surfer'' is set up between a
black-clad chorus and the male soloists, Selya and Roberts. The
bent arms and profiles of the chorus recall the machinelike
movement in ``Known by Heart.'' Yet this time the score has a less
metallic ring. Both the music and the choreography were
commissioned by the festival and the John F. Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts as the last of their ``Modern Dance and Jazz Music
Collaborations.'' To see Knaack's music as jazz would take some
doing. But rhythm, no stranger to jazz, is at the pulse of this
collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   For all their robotic manner, Parkinson, Bowman, Huber and Asnes
become increasingly abstract. They symbolize the surf that Selya
rides through his high leaps as the surfer of the title.
</P>
<P>
   In an unexpected passage Selya is mocked by Asnes and Bowman,
who perform a precious dance with mincing steps on tiptoe. There is
tremendous drive here in the constant interplay between the two
male soloists and the quartet. If Selya is the leaper, Roberts is
the turner and the audience cheered as he spun in a variety of
pirouettes beyond the call of duty.
</P>
<P>
   After all the karate kicks, pelvis swiveling and ballet bravura,
the final never-neverland of healing or redemption, peace after
turmoil, hits the right note.
</P>
<P>
   The same superb performances came from the cast of ``Mozart
Clarinet Quintet K.581,'' whose music was on tape. Tuttle, on leave
from Ballet Theater, and Parkinson were in short tunics over
chartreuse leotards. Roberts, Selya and Asnes, who began the first
section, were in Chinese-style vests by Santo Loquasto.
</P>
<P>
   Here again Tharp does not reveal where her piece will go. The
lyrical male trio, moving in and out of shifting patterns, yields
to two duets that are the work's highlight: one for Tuttle and
Selya and one for Parkinson and Roberts that is amazing in its
acrobatic convolutions. The two ensemble sections, which include a
sketched-out mazurka, are a bit entangled. But there is a novelty
about the ballet that opens up the Mozart score through a mix of
playfulness and seriousness. Scott Zielinski provided the admirable
lighting.

`THE HOT L BALTIMORE': WILLIAMSTOWN PRODUCTION RECAPTURES
ORIGINAL'S SPIRIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass. _ The girl is tireless and should, by
rights, be tiresome. There's that driving adolescent energy, to
start with, plus an unfortunate leaning to whimsy evident in her
insistence on regularly changing her name. Why, listen to her,
declaiming a list of American cities with that radioactive mix of
concentration and anarchic glee. Don't you just want to strangle
her?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, no, you don't. Nor, even more surprisingly, do any of
the characters who share the stage with her in the Williamstown
Theater Festival's affectionate new production of Lanford Wilson's
``Hot l Baltimore.''
</P>
<P>
   Played by the young actress Mandy Siegfried with the happy
unself-consciousness of a colt that has just found its legs, the
19-year-old known simply as, yes, the Girl seems to make everyone
smile, even those who feel honor-bound to despise her.
</P>
<P>
   That's still the overall effect of ``The Hot l Baltimore,'' 27
years after it opened to become the must-see off-Broadway hit,
winning New York Drama Critics Circle and Obie awards. This group
portrait of dispossessed American souls in a seedy hotel on the eve
of its demolition has always sounded impossible to stomach and been
equally impossible to resist.
</P>
<P>
   Even in 1973, reviewers remarked that the play was a throwback
to an earlier, more sentimental era of lyric drama, when William
Saroyan was serving up the dreams of the unsung and the unwanted.
Here again was a parade of lovable prostitutes and mixed nuts,
including an old man who exercised by singing opera in the lobby
and an old woman who had a close acquaintance with ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   Like Saroyan, Wilson generated a democratic glow of love for
American diversity, even as the show symbolically pointed to the
country's decline. Since it was the 1970s instead of the 1930s, it
made perfect sense when the play became the inspiration for a
sitcom on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for those who saw the original ``Hot l,'' as directed by
Marshall Mason with a cast that included the young Judd Hirsch, the
play was hardly just a sitcom in the making. Its more irritating
aspects were transformed by Wilson's and the ensemble's
``sympathetic magic,'' to borrow a term the playwright would later
use as a title, by a marrow-deep compassion and respect for the
lives portrayed. Such unconditional liking is contagious.
</P>
<P>
   The new reincarnation of ``Baltimore,'' staged by the estimable
Joe Mantello, holds on to that infectiousness. The ensemble doesn't
have the necessary rhythmic wholeness. How could it, given the
short rehearsal time at Williamstown?
</P>
<P>
   There are definitely spots of dead air amid the gloriously
shabby hotel-lobby set provided by John Lee Beatty. And those
fabled Wilson sequences of simultaneous dialogue, not unlike those
Robert Altman was creating in film at the same time, never quite
catch fire here.
</P>
<P>
   The compensations, however, are considerable. They are provided
in large part by the sense of fine actors like Lois Smith and Sam
Rockwell fully embracing their characters. Only rarely does anyone
here go for surface pathos or odd-ball cuteness. Mantello has
intelligently steered the evening's tone away from the obviously
poetic and whimsical, encouraging performances that accept
eccentricity as a matter of course.
</P>
<P>
   Take that girl, for example, the 19-year-old prostitute who,
like the father of ``The Glass Menagerie,'' has fallen in love with
long distance and spent her young life in eternal transit,
listening for the rattle of trains she can identify by their
whistles. As played by the enchanting Trish Hawkins in the original
production, she was a rather ethereal creature for someone who
traded in flesh, a fairy-tale dreamer with a hypnotic voice.
</P>
<P>
   Clad in hot pants and platform shoes that bring to mind Jodie
Foster in ``Taxi Driver'' (the sociologically ruthless costumes are
by Laura Bauer), Siegfried emphasizes the raw, overwhelming
vitality and unthinking appetite found in teen-agers. This
sharp-witted actress, seen off-Broadway in ``The Mineola Twins''
and ``Stupid Kids,'' finds her character's soul in her legs, which
seem to have restlessly flexible lives of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The Girl, of course, still has fantasies that, like those of
everyone else in Wilson's world, will never come to fruition. But
Siegfried and Mantello don't let you regard her as a pitiable
symbol. Like many people her age the Girl is, for better or worse,
a life force, existing entirely in the present. As April, the
aging, wisecracking hooker, says of dancing, in what might be the
play's watchwords: ``Nobody knows how. The important thing is to
move.''
</P>
<P>
   April is played by the invaluable Becky Ann Baker, who
definitely knows how to move, not to mention how to sell a salty
joke without shoving it down your throat. As the evening's third
and flakiest streetwalker, Cyndi Coyne is also a treat, flirting
brazenly with caricature and then retreating just in time. The same
is true of Helen Hanft, a veteran of experimental theater whose
presence sets off nostalgic echoes, and George Hall as members of
an older, increasingly lost generation.
</P>
<P>
   Smith brings a stirringly serene air of acceptance to her
spirit-communing character, an old woman with memories of an
aristocratic Southern past and someone who describes herself, in
true Wilsonian fashion, as a perpetual outsider ``with no
particular interest in peering in.'' And Rockwell is excellent as
the irritable desk clerk, a role created by Hirsch.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed as a brown-toned advertisement for everything that was
depressing about 1970s style, Rockwell never lets his period
accouterments overwhelm him, giving instead a discerningly low-key
performance. Unlike Hirsch, whose idiosyncrasies were writ large,
Rockwell fades in and out of the woodwork here, as people who have
been in one job for too long will. His character's revelation of
his own unrealized desire is all the more affecting for its
quietness.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Gilbert, an indispensable member of the brilliant ensemble
of ``Roseanne'' on television, is Jackie, the hyped-up, hustling
health food addict whose dreams are dashed most dramatically in the
play. Gilbert is likably game, but the moody intensity she
registers on camera is strangely diffused here. What should be
sustained fireworks comes across instead as a series of cap-pistol
shots.
</P>
<P>
   This is a reminder of just how much of the theater ``The Hot l
Baltimore'' is. Wilson's characters are necessarily larger than
life, because being alive is really all they have going for them.
It's not that where there's life, there's hope; these are not
hopeful people. Rather, this playwright insists that where there is
life, there is always interest. Even as its most glib and
sentimental ``The Hot l Baltimore'' still pulses with that
fascination.

   PEOPLESOFT TO INTRODUCE LATEST VERSION OF PROGRAM
</P>
<P>
   PeopleSoft plans to introduce on Tuesday the latest version of
its ``enterprise software,'' a huge and complex program that
companies use to automate dozens of tasks. The key to the newest
version is that it will be Internet-based, meaning that employees
and customers can use the program with a Web browser instead of
tapping into an internal software program.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high for PeopleSoft. Its software release is
months behind those of its competitors, Oracle and SAP. Also,
PeopleSoft is coming off a disappointing year of flat revenue and a
falling stock price.
</P>
<P>
   A NEW CAREER FOR HELEN THOMAS
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months after resigning from United Press
International, the news service where she had spent her career,
including four decades at the White House, Helen Thomas, 79, joined
Hearst Newspapers last week to write columns on the White House and
national affairs. She will write two columns, each appearing
weekly, for the company, whose papers include The Houston
Chronicle, The Seattle Post-Intelligencer and The San Francisco
Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   `HARRY POTTER' BOOK SETS RECORDS
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' the latest book in
author J.K. Rowling's popular series about the exploits of a boy
wizard, set records in its first weekend of sales, leaving many
bookstores already out of stock. The book is exactly the big,
clever, vibrant, tremendously assured installment that gives shape
and direction to the whole undertaking and still somehow preserves
the material's enchanting innocence.
</P>
<P>
   DAIMLER MAY RENT CHRYSLER SPACE
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler said it was considering leasing space in the
landmark Chrysler Building in New York, which could help the
company in its attempts to lure Wall Street investors.
</P>
<P>
   `BIG BROTHER' RATINGS SLIDE FURTHER
</P>
<P>
   After a weekend of sharply declining ratings, CBS' ``Big
Brother,'' the latest effort in the reality television trend, is
falling far short of the phenomenon status reached by two other
European imports, ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and CBS'
``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   A NEW KIND OF SYNERGY FOR TALK
</P>
<P>
   Ronald A. Galotti, the publisher of Talk magazine, sent a letter
to a few hundred people who can usually be depended upon to talk
about the magazine on the party circuit, asserting that ``a
magazine of Talk's caliber can only come together through valuable
partnerships'' like its cooperation with Miramax Films, which owns
half of the Talk Media venture. Another important partner, the
letter said, is Bacara, a resort hotel in California that bought
the first two pages of advertising in the August issue.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for publishers to alert select readers that a
new advertiser has bought pages. But it is rare for the publisher
to compare the new advertiser to one of its owners in terms of
importance.
</P>
<P>
   HEINZ HOPES CHILDREN LIKE GREEN
</P>
<P>
   In a move to raise sales of its ketchup, H.J. Heinz plans to
introduce a version on Monday that will be green and is intended to
appeal to children. Heinz has also come up with a bottle that it
says is easier for children to squeeze.

   Back in Reykjavik, Skuli Mogensen saw the wireless Internet
craze that was sweeping his native Iceland and had an inspiration:
Why not try to export the revolution by taking his company's
software for mobile wireless devices to the United States?
</P>
<P>
   So he has been preparing his company, OZ.com, to be a
trans-Atlantic wireless contender.``I had no doubt this thing will
explode in America,'' said Mogensen, 31, who incorporated OZ in San
Francisco. ``The U.S. market has relatively high usage of the
Internet, PCs, cable modems, Palm devices and cell phones, so why
shouldn't the wireless Internet be used to unite all of these
things?''
</P>
<P>
   It is far too early to handicap the chances for OZ, which
recently received a large equity investment from Ericsson, the
Swedish telecommunications company. OZ is but one of many hopefuls
in a free-for-all involving dozens of other start-ups and large
telecommunications companies to develop and promote access to the
Internet. And like the migrating Mogensen, the wireless Internet
craze is coming to the United States from overseas _ primarily
Europe and Asia, where for various reasons the trend took hold
first.
</P>
<P>
   The wireless Internet, which provides Web access on devices like
pagers, cell phones and Palm hand-held devices, is being promoted
as the most promising technological development since the Internet
itself started taking off in the early 1990s. In two or three
years, there are expected to be almost as many wireless Internet
users worldwide as people accessing the Web on wired PCs. But given
the current state of play in the industry _ and some distinct
technical shortcomings _ can the wireless Web live up to its
billing?
</P>
<P>
   The answer may depend on the ability of companies to wade
through a morass of competing technical standards in their efforts
to make wireless Web access faster and more convenient. And at
least in the early going, American consumers will find that
wireless Web surfing is a slow, bare-bones experience bearing scant
resemblance to the hard-wired version.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the euphoria phase right now, where the future seems
very bright,'' said Jane Zweig, executive vice president of
Herschel Shostek Associates, a wireless research firm. ``But pretty
soon we'll get to the pain phase, when the complications of the
wireless Internet will become apparent. Then it'll take a while to
get to the pleasure and perfection phases.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers in this country can already glimpse the wireless
Internet's potential through applications that enable them to get
stock quotes, check the weather or send short text messages over
their mobile phones or other devices. And judging from experiences
in Europe and Asia, Americans have only started to scratch the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, teen-agers download still cartoons on services
provided by NTT DoCoMo, the country's leading wireless company,
whose mobile Internet customers account for 30 percent of Japanese
Web users. In Italy, daily horoscopes are the rage. In Finland and
Sweden, one of the hottest applications is a mobile banking service
allowing people to conduct nearly every banking transaction except
withdrawing cash.
</P>
<P>
   Global growth estimates for the mobile Internet can be heady.
</P>
<P>
   According to the ARC Group, a London consulting firm, about 100
million of the world's 500 million mobile phones in use by year-end
will be capable of Internet access. Within three years, ARC says,
an estimated 300 million of 900 million wireless phones will be
Internet-ready. Other industry forecasts say that in five years, as
many as 500 million people worldwide _ one of every dozen _ will
have phones or other devices capable of wireless Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Whether those projections are close to attainable will depend
largely on efforts now under way to increase the speed of wireless
Internet connections. For now, the fastest wireless speeds range
from 9,600 to 14,400 bits a second, much slower than the Internet
connections of up to 56,000 bits a second available to people using
dial-up modems on their home computers. (And, of course, other
kinds of wired connections, like cable modems or high-speed lines
are much faster still.)
</P>
<P>
   Today's wireless speed limits mean that most wireless users in
the United States can do little more than send or receive a few
lines of Internet text through cell phones _ maybe reading a brief
news alert about the latest interest-rate decision by the Federal
Reserve, or sending a short e-mail message over a Yahoo or Hotmail
account.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, nearly everyone in the wireless industry agrees that by
next year speeds approaching that of a typical home PC connection
will be available through wireless devices, allowing sophisticated
applications like the downloading of images.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speed is a temporary problem,'' said John Garcia, senior vice
president for sales and distribution at Sprint PCS, one of the
nation's largest wireless operators, which is busily adding
Internet access to cities throughout its network.
</P>
<P>
   One reason wireless technology does not yet allow for more
sophisticated Internet applications is that companies in different
parts of the world have adopted different technological standards,
instead of rallying around a single standard that might ease
development of a common mass market for wireless Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Europe, for the most part, has adhered to a digital technology
known as GSM, which stands for global system for mobile
communications. In Asia, a mixture of standards is in use, with
CDMA, which stands for code division multiple access, dominant in
Japan and South Korea, while GSM is sporadically used elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But it is in the United States where standards have been most
fragmented, helping explain why the wireless Internet has been
slower to catch on here.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T uses a format called TDMA, or time-division multiple
access. Because TDMA does not support data transmission, AT&AMP;T has
been forced to overlay an older format to provide Internet access
through its cell phones, adding further complexity to its current
generation of handsets.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other American carriers like Sprint and Verizon have
adopted CDMA. And still others, including VoiceStream Wireless and
Pacific Bell, a unit of SBC Communications use European-style GSM.
</P>
<P>
   Unless special measures are taken to enable a phone to use
several of these formats, a device designed to work with one
wireless technology cannot be used on a network that employs
another technology.
</P>
<P>
   Most creators of wireless Internet applications have compensated
for this technical Tower of Babel by agreeing to a format called
WAP _ for wireless access protocol _ which works with any of the
various cellular transmission formats. Any WAP-enabled cell phone,
used with any flavor of cellular network, can use the same WAP
application _ a wireless restaurant locator, for example, a
stock-quote system or some wireless Internet offering. (The iMode
technology used by NTT DoCoMo in Japan is not WAP compatible.)
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the disparate carrier standards are known as the
second-generation of wireless technology _ the first generation
having been the nondigital analog technology that the original
cellular industry rolled out in the 1980s. Over the next two to
five years, the global wireless industry expects to move to a
so-called second-and-a-half digital generation, followed by a third
generation. The differences can be arcane, but the coming
generations of formats are meant to allow for much higher data
speeds _ and to be compatible with one another.
</P>
<P>
   Whether WAP continues through these next generations, or is
replaced by a new format for programmers who write the application
software, the next generations of wireless technology should make
it easier to roam from one continent to another with a single
hand-held Internet access device. And the ability to send larger
amounts of data may make the wireless Internet an option for
businesses and individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner than you think, we'll be able to do videoconferencing
with wireless access,'' said Anil Khatod, president of global
Internet solutions at Nortel Networks, the maker of network
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Nortel, companies like Ericsson, Motorola, Lucent and
Nokia are competing for tens of billions of dollars of contracts to
build new generations of wireless networks. Last year, the value of
wireless infrastructure contracts worldwide reached $28.7 billion,
a 22 percent increase from 1998, according to the Cahners In-Stat
Group, a research firm. Some of those companies, along with others
like Palm, Research in Motion and the Swatch Group, are developing
new types of devices for sending and getting wireless data and
images.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are coming up with things that will make your head spin,''
said Lawrence Rabiner, vice president for research at AT&AMP;T Labs.
One of AT&AMP;T's projects under development is a pair of
Internet-accessible ski goggles with a built-in wireless phone that
would allow skiers to hold conversations, transmit a video of their
downhill descent or pull down a course map projected onto a visor.
``It's James Bond, `Mission Impossible' stuff,'' Rabiner said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are big questions about how many new mobile
Internet services people really want, and how practical it will be
to provide or to use the most exotic applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the whole wireless Internet nirvana hype sells a lot
of papers,'' said Mark F. Bregman, who as head of pervasive
computing at IBM is working on third-generation and even
fourth-generation wireless technology. ``We need to realize that
the wireless Internet is not a panacea, that some things like doing
video on a cell phone would be impractical because video hogs so
much bandwidth.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are concerns about the amount of available
radio-wave spectrum that can be used to transmit wireless data. And
some industry executives worry quietly about whether some consumers
might get turned off at this early, homely stage in the industry's
development.
</P>
<P>
   But despite such qualms, many new participants are entering the
wireless fray _ including Brad A. Silverberg, a former high-ranking
Microsoft executive who led the company's Windows business. In
March, Silverberg and former executives from McCaw Cellular formed
the Ignition Corp., an investment firm focused entirely on wireless
Internet ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge wager we're making, but my instinct tells me
the wireless Internet is the next tech tidal wave, like the PC and
the Internet itself,'' Silverberg said. ``Will we win the bet? If
you judge our chances by the number of people and amount of
resources committed to this thing, I'd say they are very good.''

   TAX-CUT-POLITICS (Washington) _ With projections of the federal
budget surplus rising and both parties in full election-year mode,
the debate over tax cuts is shifting from whether to what kinds.

campaign season will make it difficult for any tax cuts to be
enacted before a new president and Congress take office next year.
But in Washington and on the campaign trail, Democrats from

<TEXT>
<P>
   Online retailers have been putting their marketing budgets on
crash diets this year _ replacing pricey, fatty television ads and
portal deals with leaner print ads and e-mail efforts that, like
all diet foods, may be less sumptuous but are far healthier in the
long run. More recently, dot-com retailers are testing a new item
on the low-fat marketing menu: catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Long a staple of the direct marketing industry, catalogs are the
newest fad among Web merchants who, in their pursuit of
profitability, have cast off any pretensions of Internet-only
retailing.
</P>
<P>
   It should come as no surprise, of course, that Web merchants
like RedEnvelope.com, eHats, Food.com, and eZiba.com, among others,
have either begun mass mailings or are developing such programs. It
is an accepted fact that online shoppers and catalog consumers are
a similar breed, preferring to browse through merchandise without
the help of a sales clerk, and accepting the risks inherent in
long-distance purchasing. And the back-office operations of catalog
and consumer-oriented e-commerce companies are nearly identical.
</P>
<P>
   But the catalog leanings of Internet retailers can also be
explained by looking at their executive rosters. The dot-coms spent
much of 1998 and 1999 raiding the management teams of L.L. Bean and
other giants of the direct mail realm, so it was probably
inevitable that many Web merchants would expand into catalog
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Although these Internet executives are not abandoning other
marketing campaigns as they adopt catalogs, they express delighted
surprise about how well catalogs compare with other popular
marketing approaches, like e-mail advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can produce and mail a catalog that costs about the same,
if not less, than a targeted e-mail campaign,'' said Matt Jackson,
vice president for marketing at eHats, an online hat retailer that
is developing its first catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies that conduct custom e-mail campaigns on behalf of
e-tailers may charge 25 cents or more per e-mail sent, Jackson
said. According to the Direct Marketing Association, most catalogs
cost 50 cents to $1 to print and mail to each household.
</P>
<P>
   ``With an e-mail, people either delete it or look at it quickly
and delete it,'' he said. ``But if we execute a catalog properly,
we know it'll not only get eyeballs, but it'll stay in someone's
house, so it has a shelf life and a much longer lasting impact than
a targeted e-mail campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   With catalogs, e-tailers also see a way to reach an objective
that no amount of digital alchemy can achieve _ selling goods to
the 50 percent of American households that remain without Internet
connections. ``We have to reach as many people as possible,''
Jackson said, ``and let them buy in whatever way they feel
comfortable, be it through the phone, the Web site a catalog,
whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   And even as they view catalogs as a cost-effective way to reach
offline customers, e-tailers are also looking at them as a means to
increase the Web site's traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Take eZiba.com, which sells handmade goods from far-flung
regions of the world. The company plans to begin testing a catalog
this fall with a mailing to 500,000 consumers, according to Bill
Miller, the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, a former executive vice president at F.A.O. Schwarz,
said he would use the catalog primarily to attract customers to the
eZiba Web site. ``Every time we dropped a catalog at F.A.O., we saw
a significant increase in our Web traffic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Catalogs can help create Web site traffic by showing customers a
limited, but enticing, selection of a company's overall merchandise
offerings, executives said. And because a Web order is less
expensive to process than a phone-based order, companies frequently
offer discounts or free shipping to draw customers to their sites.
</P>
<P>
   EZiba has more reason than many other e-tailers to use catalogs
as a device for generating Web traffic, rather than mainly a
vehicle for direct sales, Miller said. Because eZiba's business
involves selling goods with limited availability, the company
cannot stock enough items to support an extensive catalog mailed to
tens of millions of consumers. EZiba will ship a catalog with a
limited number of items that will be well-stocked, in case
consumers order those items in droves.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, at least, Internet merchants are nicely positioned to
produce a catalog at low cost. Many e-tailers already have plenty
of product descriptions and high-resolution digital photographs of
merchandise on hand, as well as in-house creative directors with
experience in print publishing.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Web retailers who have initiated catalog efforts say
incremental production costs are minimal. But executives said that
to market a catalog successfully, companies must overcome far more
difficult, and potentially expensive, hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Inventory management, as Miller noted, can be a huge issue.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Tom Bazzone, president of RedEnvelope.com, an online gifts
retailer that began selling through catalogs in February, said
merchants that did not properly manage inventory during a catalog
mailing risked either alienating customers with sold-out items, or
burying their warehouses in unsold merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   For most catalogs, he said, 75 to 80 percent of the sales occur
within 40 days of the mailing. As a result, many catalog operations
engage in what is called ``slotting,'' or staggering their order
volumes with suppliers. So instead of ordering 1,000 items from a
vendor, they would arrange to receive 300 initially, have another
300 delivered two weeks after the catalog is shipped, and then have
the option of either receiving or canceling the remaining items,
depending on sales.
</P>
<P>
   The process is even more complicated for Web retailers, he said,
because the same items sell at different rates through the
different channels. ``It can get very hairy,'' Bazzone said.
</P>
<P>
   Developing an effective mailing list is no snap either,
executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies must know their audience well enough to cite specific
customer demographics when they approach so-called list brokers,
who typically sell names and addresses of prospective customers for
$100 to $125 per thousand. And once the first mailing goes out,
merchants must have the personnel and technology in place to
analyze the response rates, so they can fine-tune subsequent
mailings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes Direct Marketing 101 from there,'' said Cindy
Marshall, director of marketing for eZiba.com.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for dot-coms, the course requirements for Direct
Marketing 101 also include a large section on customer service _ an
area of study that many e-tailers seemed to have slept through in
previous semesters. H. Robert Wientzen, president of the Direct
Marketing Association, an industry trade group, said Internet
merchants ``need to have real customer service when it comes to a
catalog, because customers expect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, he said, that requires substantial investment in
phone-based customer-service representatives. ``And it's probably
too late for some companies who are cash poor to make enough of an
investment in customer service to make it work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Internet companies that follow the catalog path can take
some solace in the experiences of Bazzone at RedEnvelope. He said
that only 30 percent of the orders generated by the company's
catalogs were taken over the phone. The rest, he said, came via the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Orton, senior vice president for business development at
Food.com, which delivers take-out food for 16,000 restaurants
around the country, said she hoped the company's coming catalog
effort would, like RedEnvelope.com, yield far more Web orders than
phone orders. Because the company already takes large numbers of
orders over the phone, Orton said she was not concerned about the
effect a catalog might have on customer service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see the catalog as a way to migrate people from the phone
to the online experience,'' she said. For instance, Orton said that
in a recent survey 68 percent of the customers who had ordered over
the phone said they would prefer to use the Internet. ``So we see
this as a great opportunity for us.''

WIRELESS UNIT MAKES SPRINT A LIKELY TAKEOVER TARGET 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.
Nonsubscribers can purchase one-time rights by calling 888-603-1036
or 888-346-9867.) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mention the word ``footprint'' and images of an ill-fated
Himalayan expedition in search of the yeti might come to people's
minds. But when you mention footprint to those familiar with Sprint
Corp., their eyes light up with optimism.
</P>
<P>
   In the argot of the mobile telecommunications world,
``footprint'' refers to the breadth of network coverage, and
perhaps no company has matched Sprint during the last couple of
years in its speed and efficiency at building a nationwide wireless
communications business.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, even if the company's $115 billion merger agreement
with WorldCom unravels, Sprint's wireless network remains a coveted
asset.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators in Europe oppose the WorldCom-Sprint deal on grounds
that it would leave WorldCom with too much control of Internet
traffic, while the Justice Department says it would leave too few
long-distance options. But Sprint is still expected to have
attentive suitors _ possibly Deutsche Telekom, BellSouth, and
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone _ attracted by its wireless prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprint has almost everything that a company wanting to expand
in the U.S. would want,'' said Brian Hayward, manager of the $3.6
billion Invesco Telecommunications Fund in Denver. ``But what
really makes it attractive is extensive digital nationwide wireless
coverage, because that's where many people are betting the future
is at.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint PCS, the company's wireless subsidiary, operates the
largest all-digital wireless network in the United States, covering
an area that reaches more than 70 percent of the population. Aided
by revenue from wireless Internet services that were recently
introduced, Sprint PCS' average monthly revenue per user is $54,
which is 30 percent higher than the industry average.
</P>
<P>
   Although in terms of subscribers, Sprint's wireless network
ranks fourth behind those of Verizon Wireless, SBC/BellSouth and
AT&AMP;T Wireless, the company has led the wireless industry in
subscriber growth for six consecutive quarters.
</P>
<P>
   With its own retail stores, and an aggressive distribution
effort involving more than 12,000 third-party retail outlets that
include Tandy's Radio Shack chain and Best Buy, Sprint signed up an
additional 876,000 customers in the first quarter of this year, an
18 percent increase from the comparable period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect such subscriber growth to continue, with Sprint
signing up as many as 4 million customers this year, accounting for
about 20 percent of the industry's growth in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's built a wireless network that has a lot of buzz
around it with such high-visibility growth, Sprint's an obvious
takeover play if WorldCom exits the scene,'' said Steve Shook, a
telecommunications analyst at Wachovia Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Sprint, based in Westwood, Kan., received merger
overtures from BellSouth, which was eventually outbid by WorldCom.
But the interest of BellSouth, based in Atlanta, could be rekindled
by the possibility of assembling a seamless network that would
theoretically allow a caller to use the same mobile phone from
coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   And the interest of the German communications giant, Deutsche
Telekom, has been more than explicit. The possibility of a German
bid for Sprint has already elicited a reaction from Senate leaders,
who oppose such a deal on the grounds that it might violate a law
preventing the Federal Communications Commission from transferring
radio licenses to companies that are more than 25 percent owned by
foreign governments. Cellular operators use radio waves under
license from the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said that opposition to such a deal might wilt if
the German government were to reiterate its stated intent to reduce
its stake in Deutsche Telekom, Europe's largest telecommunications
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It flies in the face of everything the United States stands
for in promoting free markets around the world for our own
government to oppose investment by a foreign telecommunications
company, whether it's state-owned or not,'' said Frank Marsala, a
telecommunications analyst at ING Barings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sprint is seeking to balance market enthusiasm for
its wireless operations with concern about a management transition
at Sprint PCS. Andrew Sukawaty, who is credited as the driving
force behind much of the Sprint PCS strategy during the last
several years, announced in May that he would step down as chief
executive of the wireless business to pursue business opportunities
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's chief operating officer, Ronald T. LeMay, is serving as
acting president of the wireless unit while a search for a new
Sprint PCS chief gets under way. LeMay and Sprint's chairman,
William T. Esrey, declined to comment on efforts to replace
Sukawaty.
</P>
<P>
   How fast Sprint becomes a takeover target depends on how quickly
its fate is untangled from WorldCom's. By then, Sprint could find
itself competing for attention among other wireless carriers, like
VoiceStream Wireless and Nextel Communications, which have also
been discussed as targets in the nation's fast-consolidating
wireless industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much attention is focused right now on the U.S. wireless
market because of the growth potential that exists here,'' said
Larry Swasey, vice president for communications research at Allied
Business Intelligence. ``Sprint probably offers a nice foothold for
expansion into the U.S., but it's a competitive marketplace with
several opportunities.''

   AUSTIN, Texas _ J.K. Rowling is fascinated by curses and spells
and suchlike, so here, in case she's interested, is the six-word
incantation that could make her the most hated woman in the Western
world:
</P>
<P>
   And then Harry Potter woke up.
</P>
<P>
   Rowling is too resourceful an artist to ever set those words to
paper, and Harry Potter fans who haven't already made their way
through the fourth book in the series can rest assured that at no
point in ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' does Rowling have
her boy hero wipe the sleep out of his eyes, look at his friends
and family and say, ``Cousin Dudley _ you were a mean little boy
named Draco Malfoy! And Uncle Vernon _ you were his father, a Death
Eater named Lucius! And Bill Gates! Bill Gates! You were Lord
Voldemort, the most evil and powerful wizard of all!''
</P>
<P>
   Rowling never stoops to the sort of mollycoddling that lesser
children's-book writers fall back on when they fear a narrative has
grown too disturbing for their young readers. Like the Brothers
Grimm before their stories were sanitized by 20th-century
animators, Rowling plays for keeps _ as readers of ``Goblet'' will
find by story's end.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a clear element of wish-fulfillment is at the heart of
the Potter series. At the start of each book, the orphaned Potter
is living with his aunt, uncle and cousin, a dim trio of
middle-class nogoodniks who force him to sleep in a cupboard
beneath the stairway. Harry is scrawny, bespectacled, has no
friends of note, and bears a disfiguring scar on his forehead, a
residue of the same car accident that killed his parents.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the first book, ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's
Stone,'' as Harry is falling asleep, he remembers when he was
younger and ``dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming
to take him away.'' Which, of course, is basically what happens in
the next two chapters _ a large, uncouth man named Hagrid shows up
to bring Harry to Hogwarts, a school for young wizards. Harry's
parents, he explains, weren't killed in a car crash _ they were
wizards murdered by the evil Voldemort, and Harry's scar was
received when he somehow survived the battle.
</P>
<P>
   At Hogwarts, Harry is as honored as he was mistreated at the
Dursleys' (to whose house he must return every summer). He quickly
learns that he is famous, that he is special, that he is powerful.
The secret life all sad children share _ an imaginary counterlife
in which they have unique talents, are descended from greatness,
and even their weaknesses qualify as a sort of offbeat wisdom _ is
the stuff of the Harry Potter series, and surely accounts for much
of its popularity.
</P>
<P>
   But Rowling, to her credit, isn't satisfied merely to coo at her
young audience's inner Prozac client. As the series goes on, it
becomes clear that Harry won't be able to coast on his gift.
</P>
<P>
   For all its surface pleasures (and make no mistake, Rowling can
be a very funny writer) the first Potter book, ``The Sorcerer's
Stone,'' was mildly unsatisfying _ at least to the adult reader. No
sooner did Potter face a crisis than Rowling would resolve it, well
before a sense of dread could embed itself in the narrative. As
most occult literature worthy of the name makes clear, the exercise
of magic power always comes at a cost _ or at least a risk. And
Rowling's universe seemed a frictionless place.
</P>
<P>
   But as the series has unfolded, her plan has become clearer. In
the first books, she was repairing Harry's wounded ego. By last
year's ``Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' and,
especially, ``Goblet,'' Harry is going through the first steps of
adult character formation _ the willingness to sacrifice for
others, to act rationally in the face of anger, to put off instant
gratification for long-term payoff.
</P>
<P>
   Such lessons are hard-learned, and though Rowling gets off some
funny lines in the margins of her narrative (``Miss Granger remains
the only person in this class who has managed to turn a hedgehog
into a satisfactory pincushion. I might remind you that your
pincushion, Thomas, still curls up in fright if anyone approaches
it with a pin!''), ``Goblet'' is a genuinely dark book, complete
with oozing sores, dismemberment and murders that might be too much
for the 5-year-olds said to be among Harry's fans (though maybe
``Goosebumps'' has already inured them to this sort of thing). Even
some of Harry's closest friendships begin to strain under the
weight of class differences, hidden agendas, and _ in case you
doubted these children are now teen-agers _ sexual jealousy. Unless
I miss my guess, in the next (and, apparently, last) three books,
Harry will grow stronger and begin to feel the tug of Voldemort's
worldview, the pitiless logic of self-justification that the
powerful call Truth and the rest of us call Evil.
</P>
<P>
   There's been much hullabaloo about the size of ``Goblet''; each
book in the series is longer then the previous, and at 734 pages
``Goblet'' is a big leap from ``Azkaban's'' 435. Overindulgent, the
naysayers have whispered, wondering if success hasn't gone to
Rowling's head. But ``Goblet'' moves along steadily enough, and by
confronting her young readers with such a tome, Rowling has given
them the opportunity to develop their powers of reading as Harry
develops his powers of sorcery.
</P>
<P>
   At Book People's Friday night party for the ``Goblet''
unveiling, I felt a twinge of envy when our host asked one little
girl how long she planned to take to read the book. ``Two weeks,''
the little girl said into the microphone. I wasn't jealous just
because I was going to spend the next 32 hours plowing my through
the book so I could hit a Sunday review deadline, but because I
remembered how long it had been since I got lost in literature, the
way children do.
</P>
<P>
   Tolkien's Middle Earth, Asimov's Foundation universe, Lewis'
Narnia: They were places you took up residence in, and unless you
were a precociously fast reader, for a long time. The schoolday
kept you busy until 3, sports until 5, dinner, homework and TV
until bedtime, and then, until lights out (and maybe, if you could
get away with it, well past), you'd dive into the book on your
night table before drifting off to sleep. And then, through the
whole school-sports-dinner-homework cycle the next day, find
yourself daydreaming about that other world, constructing fanciful
versions of what

   MIDEAST-CLINTON _WASHINGTON _ President Clinton goes to Camp
David Sunday forwhat's likely to be his last clean shot at a high
stakes foreign policy win to burnish a legacy stained by scandal.
While he'll continue for the rest of his term to juggle an armful
of international issues _ China trade, national missile defense,
Balkans peacekeeping among them _ no other initiative has consumed
so much of his time, so captured the imagination of the public or
is so ripe for completion as the quest to end half a century of
conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. Appropriate to the
stakes for himself and for history, Clinton has chosen a venue rich
in symbolism and resonant with hope. (Deans, Cox News Service)

HELEN THOMAS IS BACK AS A COLUMNIST WITH HEARST 
ELLE DECOR EDITOR JUMPS TO HOUSE BEAUTIFUL 
TALK FINDS NEW SYNERGY, OR IS IT JUST SOAP?
</HEADLINE>
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four decades in the White House covering the assassination of
John F. Kennedy, the humiliations of Richard M. Nixon and the
indiscretions of Bill Clinton did not leave Helen Thomas feeling
disillusioned, jaded or in need of rest. It left her longing to
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to be there every day,'' said Thomas, the unofficial
doyenne of the White House press corps. ``I sort of consider it
almost a second office.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months after resigning from United Press
International, the wire service where she had spent her career, the
79-year-old journalist joined Hearst Newspapers last week to write
columns on the White House and other national affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas worked at UPI for 57 years, surmounting discrimination
against women in the newsroom to become the organization's most
famous correspondent. But she quit in May, the day after a company
controlled by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, founder of the Unification
Church, bought the wire service. ``It was a bridge too far,''
Thomas recalled last week.
</P>
<P>
   After her abrupt departure, she had doubts about working again.
Not that she wanted to retire. At her age, she simply thought it
might be hard to find a job. ``I was amazed,'' Thomas said. ``I had
no idea I would have so many nice offers.''
</P>
<P>
   She will write two columns a week for a company whose papers
include The Houston Chronicle, The Seattle Post-Intelligencer and
The San Francisco Examiner. One of her weekly columns will recount
the many political anecdotes she has amassed. The other will tackle
the issues of the day: families without health insurance, children
in poverty, guns and violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outrage, that's my adrenaline,'' she said. ``People should be
reminded of the injustices around them.''

   Elle Decor Editor Jumps to House Beautiful
</P>
<P>
   Is there anything more important in the world of interior design
than the new popularity of the $10,000 AGA 59-inch radiant-surface
cooker stove? Any story more pressing than the sad decline of
chintz? What about the befuddling hegemony of Restoration Hardware
chic?
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that could eclipse such decorating puzzlements is
having the top editor of one home-design magazine jump ship for
another. Marian McEvoy, the editor in chief of Elle Decor,
published by the Hachette Filipacchi Magazines unit of Lagardere,
resigned on Thursday to take over House Beautiful, a 104-year-old
publication owned by Hearst Magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Oliver Gropp, House Beautiful's longtime editor in chief,
who favored features on traditional decorating styles, announced
his retirement in May. McEvoy made her mark at Elle Decor by
featuring stories on a starker aesthetic.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for McEvoy will be to reconcile her more eclectic
sensibility _ she has used a glue gun to cover entire rooms of her
apartment with seashells, for instance _ with the expectations of
House Beautiful's 876,262 readers.
</P>
<P>
   Her appointment could significantly weaken Elle Decor, which has
441,122 readers, and no clear candidate in mind to replace her.
</P>
<P>
   It will also affect House &AMP; Garden, the other large home-design
magazine. Published by the Conde Nast unit of Advance Publications,
House &AMP; Garden has a circulation of 770,325, but newsstand sales
dipped 18.7 percent the last six months of 1999, according to the
Audit Bureau of Circulations.
</P>
<P>
   McEvoy said she had not made any editorial decisions yet. ``It
is certainly a big challenge to have more readers,'' she said.
``You have to be clever about addressing the needs of more readers.
And we love cleverness. We've got lots of cleverness.''

   Talk Finds New Synergy, or Is It Just Soap?
</P>
<P>
   First, synergy. Now, miniature bath soap.
</P>
<P>
   When Talk magazine was introduced a year ago, the editor in
chief, Tina Brown, discussed the potential for cooperative efforts
with Miramax Films, which owns half of the Talk Media venture.
</P>
<P>
   The Miramax relationship came up again in a letter from Talk
Media's president, Ronald A. Galotti, to what is known at Talk as
``Tina's hot list'' _ a few hundred people who, apart from those in
the news media, include demicelebrities and so-called A-list people
who can usually be depended upon to talk about the magazine on the
party circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Galotti's letter last week asserted that ``a magazine of Talk's
caliber can only come together through valuable partnerships'' and
pointed out how, for example, Talk has ``embraced its multimedia
partnership with Miramax Films.''
</P>
<P>
   And as of August, Galotti's letter went on, Talk magazine will
have a yet another corporate ``association.'' This one is not with
a company that is an owner of the magazine, nor is it even with a
media company; it is with Bacara, a resort hotel in California that
is not yet open. Galotti's letter was accompanied by a pamphlet
promoting the creature comforts of the resort. (``In-room spa
services. Bathrobes and slippers. Luxurious bathroom amenities.'')
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for magazine publishers to alert select
readers that a new advertiser has bought pages in the magazine. But
it is rare for the publisher to compare the new advertiser to one
of its owners in terms of importance. In this instance, a hotel
does not offer the synergistic opportunities for film-making,
screenwriting or developing young talent that Miramax, a unit of
Walt Disney, does.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members at Talk say that Bacara, as an incentive to
advertise, was offered the sweetener that the publisher would
promote the hotel to a select group of Hollywood heavyweights. And
Bacara accepted, buying the first two pages of advertising in
Talk's August issue.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Talk needs ad pages. According to an independent
count (Talk's ad pages are not yet monitored by the Publishing
Information Bureau), it started with 126.3 ad pages in its first
issue last September but dipped to 48.6 pages in February, 70.8 in
April, 41.3 in March and 36.1 in the June/July issue.
</P>
<P>
   Galotti was unavailable for comment. Hilary Bass, a spokeswoman
for Talk, said that the relationship with Bacara should not be
construed as a corporate partnership _ even if Galotti had compared
it in depth and importance to the magazine's tie to Miramax.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new association is standard procedure,'' Bass said. ``This
is just to show that they are a new advertiser in the magazine and
we hope to do more business with them.''

 &HT;    Venus generates media flurry
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke

<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Richard Williams might have called it
``Venus' Party'' on his hand-written sign, but she didn't have much
time for the celebration after winning her first Grand Slam title
at Wimbledon on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams turned into a media belle the moment she leapt in
victory at Centre Court. Photographers immediately started
recording images that would fill the morning papers in London,
across the ocean in their U.S. home and all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Many headlines in England played on Venus' first name. ``Venus
In Orbit'' read the front of the Sunday Times' sports section,
while the Sunday Mirror called her ``Venus de Smile'' and
``Victory-V. Venus on a different planet as she wins it by a
smile.''
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as the trophies had been awarded Venus and runner-up
Lindsay Davenport, the interviews began for Venus. She handled 15
engagements for 11 individual media outlets, plus a group interview
and group photo shoot for everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Her television obligations included the BBC, NBC, Turner, ESPN
and stations from South America, Germany and Spain. She also talked
with USA Today and Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   That ended her work on Saturday and she was free to continue
hugging her trophy or to eat a good meal or celebrate in any other
way.
</P>
<P>
   But she wasn't free much more 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   By 10 a.m., Venus and sister Serena Williams _ a singles
semifinalist ousted by Venus and doubles finalist with Venus _ were
due on the golf course across the street from the club to do an
interview via satellite for a Sky News show called ``Sunday with
Boulton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very big thing in London,'' said WTA spokeswoman
Raquel Martin, who is based in Europe. ``He talks to the biggest
politicians and celebrities.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the sisters went to a house in Wimbledon village
owned by IMG to tape a segment for ``Good Morning, America'' that
will air this morning. They spent about 15 minutes there, then
returned to the club grounds for a joint session with a company
that does an annual Wimbledon documentary for the tournament's
museum.
</P>
<P>
   They finished about noon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then Venus went to buy shoes for the ball,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Venus named the fact that she bought a gown for the famed
Wimbledon Champions Dinner before she left Palm Beach Gardens as
motivation for her victory here. She wouldn't reveal details about
the dress _ except that it has beads _ but hoped to show it off at
the 10:30 p.m. ball Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It was held at the Savoy Hotel in central London, considered one
of the city's ``poshest'' hotels. Singles finalists each received a
table so the Williams' entourage all was expected. Others among the
approximately 400 invited included All England Club members, former
singles champions, seniors participants and the presidents of the
international tennis federations.
</P>
<P>
   But if Venus and Serena went, they probably didn't stay long.
The doubles final they had expected to play Sunday afternoon was
postponed until today because of heavy rain that delayed the men's
final between Pete Sampras and Patrick Rafter for hours.
</P>
<P>
   That match ended four minutes before 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the eighth-seeded Williams sisters will play fourth seeds
Julie Halard-Decugis and Ai Sugiyama at noon today. They'll be
seeking another history-making day, as they try to become the first
all-black doubles team to win Wimbledon.

IN `BLACK JULY,' A SINGLE TEST DETERMINES FATE OF CHINA'S
STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Madly poring over notes one last time, giddy after
months of dawn-to-midnight cramming, the students skittered into
the exam site, a Beijing high school.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the school gates, hundreds of parents just stood and
stared for hours, fanning themselves furiously, as if to dissipate
their tension along with the muggy summer heat.
</P>
<P>
   This is ``Black July'' in China, time for the long-anticipated
single exam that determines who goes to college in a country where
a degree is seen as a ticket to prosperity, and failure can mean
consignment to drudgery.
</P>
<P>
   The 4 million high school seniors who took the entrance exam
these past three days across China have worlds riding on the
outcome _ what rank of college they may enter, or whether they can
attend college at all.
</P>
<P>
   Their parents, many of whom were robbed of a chance at higher
education by the turmoil of Mao's Cultural Revolution, are often
more nervous than their offspring, and have at least as much
invested in the result.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our time, young people had to go work in the countryside,''
said Zhang Mei, whose 19-year-old daughter and only child, Li Hui,
hopes to study business management and somberly called the exam ``a
turning point in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhang and her husband were among those who missed out on college
in Mao's upheaval, and then, as things returned to normal in the
late 1970s, were held to a single child by newly stringent family
planning rules. So their daughter is the repository of stifled
dreams. ``We weren't well educated,'' said Zhang, who works in a
railway personnel office. ``But to make it in society these days
you just have to go to college.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a growing number of parents, Zhang and her husband splurged
to rent an air-conditioned hotel room near their daughter's
assigned test site, so she would have a comfortable place to rest
between sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a really big event in her life,'' Zhang said. ``She
needs to be relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some classmates, though, her daughter decided not to
supplement her fierce studying with much-advertised pills like
``Brain Relaxer'' or ``Never Forget,'' fish-oil products said to
improve blood flow in the brain and to enhance memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more nervous than my daughter,'' said Yan Yanan, one of
the furiously fanning mothers waiting outside the Chen Jinglun High
School, one of 77 testing sites in Beijing, and another parent
whose own educational hopes were crushed by Maoist excess. ``I'm
worried that she might fail, or have to go to a second-rate
university, but college has become a `must' these days.''
</P>
<P>
   In just one sign of the importance attached to this exam, the
Beijing city government banned nearly all night-time construction
work for the last few weeks, lest any student's concentration be
disturbed. The city also set up a special hotline for noise
complaints. Newspapers have been filled with admonitions not to put
pressure on the students, about ideal diets and even strategies for
how to avoid traffic jams en route to the test.
</P>
<P>
   In the five-part exam, universally agreed to be murderous,
everyone must take the tests in Chinese, English and math and then
must choose either the science track, involving tests in chemistry
and physics or the liberal arts track, with tests in politics and
history.
</P>
<P>
   According to government projections, only about half of the
test-takers - themselves an elite who tested into academic high
schools after junior high - will gain entry to college. Overall,
because of the scarcity of slots, only about 12 percent of young
adults in China can attend college, a far lower share than in most
Western countries, which only enhances the value of a degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``This exam is like a big mountain in front of you,'' said He
Jianming, a Beijing writer who just published a book about its
social impact. ``If you get over the top, you'll see a bright
future, the pot of gold. If you fail, your life seems to be at an
end.''
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, most of those taking the exam will find their way to
college _ preferably, of course, into the most prestigious schools
like Beijing University or Qinghua, China's equivalents of Harvard
and MIT.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are incomparably higher for students in smaller towns
and rural areas, for whom a good score can mean the difference
between a life with open horizons _ including the prized right to
live and work in a big city _ and a life of near-certain hardship.
</P>
<P>
   Wang Guangli knows all about the pressures and potential
payoffs. In 1985, as a student from a poor farm town in Sichuan
province, he tested brilliantly, escaped to a university in
Shanghai and is now a successful documentary filmmaker in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My classmates who didn't pass have horrible lives now,'' he
said bluntly. Most of them, he said, either remained as poor
farmers or became migrant workers in the cities, holding menial
jobs at best.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, Wang flew back to his hometown of Meishan to
help his nephew, Zhao Hao, prepare for the exam. He did this, Wang
said, not to tutor the boy _ he had already studied 16 hours a day
for months _ but to help him relax in the final hours by talking
about anything but chemistry and math.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of what he hopes will be his ticket to a legal
career, the nephew sounded more philosophical than his uncle.
``They say all roads lead to Rome,'' the boy said by telephone.
``But I think the college exam is a shortcut.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone complains about the iron rule of this single,
standardized test and the way it distorts young people's lives and
the curriculum they study. Yet the exam, which prolongs a venerable
imperial tradition of examinations for high office, is also seen as
a relatively fair and honest way to hand out scarce college places.
And with the existing curriculum so intertwined with the exam,
change comes hard.
</P>
<P>
   But complaints are growing about the system's discrimination in
favor of already privileged residents of Beijing and Shanghai. Many
universities, including the nation's finest, are located in these
two cities and a disproportionate number of their slots are
allocated to local residents.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Beijing students are admitted to good universities
with scores far below those of students from large provinces like
Hunan or Hubei who may find no college spot at all.
</P>
<P>
   While the exam still provides a way for smart students from poor
families to crack into the elite, its equalizing effect is also
undermined by the rising tuition and other fees charged by public
universities. Since they know their families could never raise the
$1,000 a year or more that is required to attend college these
days, He said, some bright students do not even bother to enroll
for the entrance exam, while others score high but cannot take
advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   Children from better-off families, even if they test abysmally,
can also pay to attend one of the hundreds of generally second-rate
private colleges that have sprung up to meet the demand for college
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   In the final days of July, students will learn their test
scores. Those who don't make it to college have a dismal fallback:
they can try again next ``Black July,'' in fact every July until
they turn 25.

ALL ABOARD THE ROWLING EXPRESS

<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD THE HOGWARTS EXPRESS, near Oxford, England _ J.K.
Rowling, the creator of Harry Potter, insists that she does not
regard herself as a celebrity. But the assertion rings a little
hollow when you are traveling in a style once reserved for royalty,
in a personal train full of plush and brocade, crisscrossing
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Of course this train _ the Hogwarts Express, named for the train
that takes Rowling's blockbuster creation to the Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry in all four Harry Potter books _ is the
centerpiece of a publicity stunt timed to celebrate and feed the
frenzy stirred by the latest in the series, ``Harry Potter and the
Goblet of Fire,'' published to great hullabaloo Saturday. And the
apparent luxury _ dining car resplendent with white linen and
crystal, sleeping car for Rowling and the entourage from
Bloomsbury, her British publisher _ is not quite the magical ride
of the novels.
</P>
<P>
   The train rocks and rattles and wheezes. Its 57-year-old steam
engine develops a fault and has to be towed behind a diesel
locomotive. The antique cars make so much din that a reporter's
tape recorder is overwhelmed with white noise during a tightly
scheduled 30-minute interview in an observation car. The train's
itinerary is to trundle for four days from book signing to book
signing at railway stations large and small where the Harry Potter
aficionados await a glimpse of the person who gave them their hero.
</P>
<P>
   And at the center of all this stew of hype, stress, adulation
and ever-changing deadlines stands Joanne Kathleen Rowling, a
slight, 34-year-old writer from Britain's university-educated
middle-class, a onetime single mother on welfare now credited with
being No. 3 among Britain's top-earning women, with a reported $22
million-plus already gathered from a lightning career.
</P>
<P>
   But the moment is not all triumph, and in a way this rolling
monument to success says as much about modern Britain as it does
about the phenomenon of Harry Potter. There is an expectation, for
instance, that her success automatically entitles the world beyond
the Hogwarts Express to bestow the familiar trappings of celebrity
_ photographers' popping flashes, glamour to feed dreams _ as if
acclaim for her writing made Rowling the same kind of public
property as others might only yearn to be.
</P>
<P>
   And there has been a possibly curmudgeonly reluctance in the
broader literary world to allow Harry Potter _ and Rowling _ to
pass by without pointing out that however Harry Potter may be drawn
as a fictional persona (one respected literary editor called him a
``cipher''), Huck Finn he ain't. Even as the cash registers have
been ringing across the Atlantic, Rowling's work has lost out on
two prestigious prizes: the Whitbread, for book of the year, and
the Carnegie, the top British prize for children's writers. (``She
was thrilled to bits just to be short-listed,'' said a Bloomsbury
publicist, Rosamund de la Hey.)
</P>
<P>
   Rowling's books, said the author and Whitbread jurist Anthony
Holden in The Observer a few weeks ago, are ``Disney cartoons
written in words, no more.'' (The U.S. reaction seems more
``celebratory,'' Rowling observed in the interview. ``It's a
horrible cliche, but Americans do regard success differently.'')
</P>
<P>
   Of course the publication of the fourth book has been
mercilessly hyped. And with Warner Brothers planning to begin
filming the first Harry Potter movie in the fall, directed by Chris
Columbus of ``Home Alone'' and ``Mrs. Doubtfire'' renown, the
exploitation of the dream world Rowling spins around the boy wizard
is only beginning. But will that lead to an anti-commercial
backlash? It is an issue, Rowling implies, on which she is ready to
take a stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would do anything to prevent Harry from turning up in
fast-food boxes everywhere,'' she said. ``I would do my utmost.
That would be my worst nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   From approving the script for the forthcoming movie to the
spinoffs it produces, Rowling seems to be ready to defend her
vision of Harry Potter to the last. In conversations with the
director Steven Spielberg about a possible Spielberg movie of Harry
Potter, she said, the project never went anywhere because ``this
film would be my vision, and I think he felt he would he hampered
in giving his imagination free rein.''
</P>
<P>
   And on the commercialization of the fourth book, she said, ``I'm
quite clear in my mind what I would like to be out there and what I
wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowling has sought to maintain similar control over public
access to her personal life, but that has not always been possible
and, much as she sought in the earlier years of her success to
pretend to herself that acclaim would not change her life, it has.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for instance, Britain's tabloids tracked down her
ex-husband, a Portuguese journalist named Jorge Arantes with whom
she had a brief marriage in the early 1990s. Rowling has brought up
their daughter, Jessica, single-handed. But suggestions that her
ex-husband may have helped in the creation of Harry Potter rankle
with her. ``He had about as much input into Harry Potter as I had
into `A Tale of Two Cities,' '' she said tartly.
</P>
<P>
   After the breakup of the marriage in Portugal, she returned with
Jessica to Edinburgh, weighted by depression and poverty. ``If you
have been through three or four years of worrying on a daily basis
about the money running out,'' she said, ``you are never going to
forget what that's like.''
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledged that she shook her depression in 1994 only with
nine months of counseling, realizing later that her continued
ability to write during this period was ``a sign that I wasn't very
badly depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding a publisher for the first Harry Potter book was not easy
either, she said, and she is still at a loss to explain what,
precisely, has propelled sales of more than 30 million, most of
them in the United States, a landscape remote from the
boarding-school culture of Hogwarts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't explain it,'' she said. ``I don't have an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   But, offering an oblique riposte to those who have criticized
her use of language or the depth of her characterization, she said:
``I just write what I wanted to write. I write what amuses me. It's
totally for myself. I never in my wildest dreams expected this
popularity.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no formula,'' she added later.
</P>
<P>
   With the arrival of the fourth book this weekend, hundreds of
children and their parents have waited at the railside stops,
forming lines for book signings. Batteries of television cameras at
King's Cross station in London _ where the Hogwarts Express
departed for its four-day perambulation ending Tuesday in Perth,
Scotland _ were so intrusive that her fans had a hard time
glimpsing her. In a nation that celebrated Diana as the People's
Princess and is obsessive about celebrity from soccer players to
soap stars, did she feel she had joined those illustrious ranks?
</P>
<P>
   No, she said. She has sometimes been recognized and has been
photographed writing in her favorite cafes in Edinburgh. (``The
first draft is always in longhand,'' she said.) But ``I can go
completely unnoticed down any street in Edinburgh,'' she said.
``Celebrity is not a word I would even apply to myself at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course her life has changed: just giving interviews on a
personal train underscores the transformation from obscurity.
Television news has charted the sales, in Britain, of the entire
record first print run from warehouses to bookshops: 1,027,000,
said Bloomsbury's chief executive, Nigel Newtown.
</P>
<P>
   A promotional tour in the United States is to follow in the
fall. ``But then I go home, and life will resume its normal
pattern,'' she said. ``It's not particularly interesting _ seeing
friends, working, raising a daughter _ the most important thing in
my life, Harry included.''
</P>
<P>
   Her newest book, ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' is
arguably her most ambitious. It is the longest _ 734 pages in the
American edition from Scholastic _ and that is longer than even she
imagined. She was late delivering the manuscript. She worked
10-hour days to produce it. She had, she said, to start over from
midway through when she realized that part of the plot had not been
set up to reach the conclusion she wanted. Not only that, the
fourth book was designed as the culminating point to which the
first three had been leading. (There are supposed to be seven,
meaning three more are due.)
</P>
<P>
   For the first time she touches on themes like political
involvement, jealousy, fame, romance and the death of a Potter
ally: all rites of passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the end of an era in the context of the whole series of
books,'' she said. ``For Harry his innocence is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   She intimated that as the series progresses the mood may darken.
The death of one character in the fourth book, she said, is ``the
beginning of the deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, though, death was not the most difficult theme to
handle. ``I don't want to disturb children,'' she said, ``but I
don't want to write about death as if it's something that doesn't
happen.'' And after all the whole series begins with the death of
Harry's parents.
</P>
<P>
   So what was the hardest part?
</P>
<P>
   The answer was a character called Rita Skeeter, a hard-bitten
journalist with a liking for fabrication and scoops, usually
blending the two into one. ``I knew people would assume that this
was my response to what's happened to me,'' she said. But she
decided to go ahead with the character anyhow.
</P>
<P>
   One question that begs asking after Rowling's success in the
United States is why none of the characters are Americans. In the
latest books the reader is introduced to European wizards, and
there is even a passing reference to African and American wizards.
But Rowling, who calls herself ``a very British person,'' insists
that ``you are not going to get an American exchange student
brought in at Hogwarts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it would be faithful to the tone of the books,''
she said, ``to have somebody brought in from Texas or wherever it
might be.''

CBS'S `BIG BROTHER' TRAILS IN THE TV RATINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a weekend of sharply declining ratings, CBS's ``Big
Brother,'' the latest effort in the reality television trend, is
falling far short of the phenomenon status reached by two other
European imports, ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and CBS's
``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, without a turnaround in its downward momentum, ``Big
Brother'' runs the risk of becoming a hugely expensive flop.
</P>
<P>
   After a big rating for the show's first episode on Wednesday,
ratings dropped precipitously every night for the episodes on
Thursday, Friday and Saturday. The show lost more than 40 percent
of its rating on Thursday night. On Friday, based on ratings for
the nation's biggest cities, which approximate what the national
rating will be, it dropped an additional 25 percent. And Saturday,
again based on those ratings from the biggest cities, ``Big
Brother'' lost 20 percent and sank to the status of an also-ran,
beaten by a repeat movie on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   National ratings will be available Monday. But the trend for the
show was clear from the so-called overnight ratings from the
biggest cities. On Friday, ``Big Brother'' scored a 6.1 rating. It
had scored a 13.9 on Wednesday in the national ratings and an 8 on
Thursday. Each national rating point represents just over one
million homes.
</P>
<P>
   The 6.1 overnight rating Friday was still good enough for ``Big
Brother'' to claim leadership in its 8 p.m. time period. But two
other shows later that evening, ``Dateline'' on NBC and ``20/20''
on ABC, both scored much higher ratings, an 8.4 and a 7.3
respectively. The other reality shows that became hits as summer
series, ``Millionaire'' and ``Survivor,'' have both consistently
beaten everything else on the nights they have been on.
</P>
<P>
   The news for CBS got much worse on Saturday night. The overnight
rating for ``Big Brother'' plunged to just a 4.85 for an hourlong
episode. (Thursday and Friday's shows were each a half-hour). That
was not even good enough to win the time period in the overnight
ratings. ``Ground Control,'' a repeat of a movie on ABC, managed a
4.9 for that hour. The movie eventually averaged a 5.3 for two
hours. ``Big Brother'' also trailed other shows on later in the
evening, a repeat of ``NYPD Blue'' on ABC and ``America's Most
Wanted'' on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is worrisome for CBS because the network spent $20
million to acquire rights to ``Big Brother,'' which has been a hit
in Holland, Spain and Germany, and CBS committed to running the
series for 89 nights this summer. Having seen the ratings decline
every night for the first four shows, CBS now has 85 more nights to
go. &QL;

   It struck me, while laughing my way through ``Me, Myself and
Irene,'' that its creators may be the only comic filmmakers in
America who truly find white people at least as preposterous as
they find black people. And given that they are white, this is a
real accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been deduced from what the writing-directing trio
of Peter Farrelly, Bobby Farrelly and Mike Cerrone did with (and
to) the white characters of ``Dumb and Dumber'' and ``There's
Something About Mary.'' Such goings on! Such rambunctious ids and
demented egos! But whites are rarely considered ``white'' until
nonwhite characters show up on the same screen.
</P>
<P>
   I did remember seeing a black midget in the trailer for
``Irene,'' but he was attacking Jim Carrey first with his tiny
fists and then with a nightstick. It was easy to think, ``Well,
boys will be brats'' and go on about one's business. After all, the
midget was cited in passing, if at all, in most reviews as just one
more example of compulsive cinematic vulgarity, along with sex
toys, barnyard animals and toilet jokes.
</P>
<P>
   But vulgarity can be the best weapon against a standing army of
platitudes and pieties. Bless that midget. He is a loud, paranoid
cabdriver who picks a pointless fight with Charlie (Carrey), the
sweet state trooper who is about to escort his new bride over the
threshold of their home. Surely the joke is on political
correctness, you think, as he rants on about bigotry (It's racism!
It's a small people thing!) in his ghetto voice.
</P>
<P>
   But our midget is also a graduate student at Brown and a chapter
president of Mensa, the self-described organization ``for bright
people'' whose sole qualification for membership is a high IQ.
Charlie's lithe blonde bride is a Mensa chapter president also. The
two lock eyes and eventually end up running away together, leaving
Charlie with three black sons (Anthony Anderson, Mongo Brownlee and
Jerod Mixon). And since he refuses to acknowledge that the triplets
were fathered by the black midget, he refuses to acknowledge that
they are black.
</P>
<P>
   Do you remember ``My Three Sons'' with Fred MacMurray as the
wrly avuncular TV dad? The home scenes here are demented episodes
of that show, with MacMurray's confident wryness turned slightly
anxious and _ when he tosses a few ``soul'' expressions their way _
ingratiating. It is nice racial trompe l'oeil that the actors
playing the triplets don't really resemble one another much more
than they resemble Carrey. True, they're all big, and they're all
about the same shade of brown. (Carrey and a number of male cast
members are tall and all about the same shade of pale beige.)
</P>
<P>
   The boys banter like street thugs, love and honor their father,
and trade competitive chaff _ shall we say signify on each other _
about physics problems and SAT scores. One brother protests that he
got 1,430 out of a possible 1,600 points because he had the flu.
You'd have to have an aneurysm to get 1430 he is told with cheerful
disdain.
</P>
<P>
   Is it believable that black triplets who talk like street thugs
(or rappers) can be top students and good sons? Let's look at it
this way. In 1967, when Sidney Poitier played a distinguished
scientist who is a candidate for a Nobel Prize in Stanley Kramer's
film about interracial love and courtship, ``Guess Who's Coming to
Dinner,'' how many people found it believable? Viewers and
reviewers both complained about the lack of realism. Why did
Poitier's character have to be so dazzlingly exceptional, they kept
asking? It strained credibility.
</P>
<P>
   And it isn't as if the intervening 33 years have brought us a
spate of movies in which blacks are terrifically smart and
confident about much beyond their clothes, their sexual prowess or
their criminal records. (And clearly we're talking about men here.
There haven't been a lot of movies in which black women played
anything that could be called a leading role.)
</P>
<P>
   So I loved these vaudevillian whiz kids. Ditto the jungle-fever
kisses exchanged by the black midget and the full-size blonde as
they drove off together. ``I guess the heart wants what the heart
wants,'' she tells Charlie. And it's true of comedy, too. However
outrageous the situation, once it compels our laughter, we've let
it into our world. The absurd wouldn't matter if we didn't know it
was the shadow side _ disdained, longed for, or both _ of the
normal.
</P>
<P>
   The actors playing the whiz kid sons as vaudeville join a long
line of black comics who started out in late-19th-century minstrel
shows and worked like mad to turn a style that signified the
bumptious, the bombastic and the genetically inept into an
innovative form of verbal and physical comedy. Of course the
triplets watch Richard Pryor and Chris Rock on television.
</P>
<P>
   And so does their Daddy, which is just right in terms of comic
genealogies. Carrey got his first real break in 1990 as one of two
white performers on ``In Living Color,'' the Wayans Brothers'
raucous black comedy show.
</P>
<P>
   And he out-minstreled everyone in sight. He was shameless and
outrageous: a white fool or a maniac who kept his white face on at
all times. Steve Martin had given us a sweeter less staccato
version of the white minstrel in his early years; it was no
accident that in his first movie, ``The Jerk,'' he played a
character who thought he had been born black.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Old-time vaudeville made fun of most white ethnics for a time:
the Irish, the Italians, the Germans, the Jews, sometimes playing
themselves and sometimes playing one another. And there have been
plenty of comics since who played dumb, dumber and dumbest with
gusto, from Lou Costello to Tommy Smothers and Dick Martin; from
Art Carney as Ed Norton on ``The Honeymooners'' to Jerry Lewis at
his most infantile and Dean Martin at his most mentally woozy.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Carrey who keeps the race engine fueled and running.
And he's wonderful here as the man with two inadequate
personalities: Charlie, the sweet, repressed sap, and Hank, the
mellifluously crude bully. Every muscle of his face and every bone
in his body are utterly committed to these alternating bouts of
mousiness and mania.
</P>
<P>
   People keep saying that since the script for ``Me, Myself and
Irene'' was written 10 years ago, the Farrellys dragged it out of
their drawer and tossed it cynically onto a movie screen because
they knew they were on a roll. I won't overstate things by
insisting that we have a masterpiece of radical entertainment here,
especially since the movie drifts into a formula feel-good rescue
and happy ending. But really could they have gotten it made with
all the racial nose-thumbing intact before they became famous?
</P>
<P>
   Interracial lust and familial warmth are still pretty much taboo
in the movies, as is the sight of not one, not two but three
super-smart, well-adjusted and hip black male teen-agers. However
race is lived off screen in America, people are still happiest when
it makes its on screen appearance as fantasy. It might be the
science fiction of ``The Matrix,'' the high-tech espionage of
``Mission Impossible'' or the comic improbabilities of ``Me, Myself
and Irene.'' And when it comes to comedy, race is still the best _
and the worst _ joke ever played on the United States of America.

`HARRY POTTER': AT LAST, THE WIZARD GOES BACK TO SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The funny thing about Harry Potter is that he was famous from
the start. ``There will be books written about Harry _ every child
in our world will know his name!'' J.K. Rowling announced with
spooky accuracy in the opening chapter of her first novel, ``Harry
Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.'' No doubt she meant this as a
reflection of Harry's awesome powers of wizardry, not of his
ability to land on magazine covers and lure children to bookstores
at the witching hour. But the fact is that Rowling's gifts of
prophecy have proved nearly as amazing as all the magical feats she
ascribes to Harry and company. Still, not even she could have
predicted  &UR; this &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The frenzy that has greeted the fourth book in the series,
``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' would seem to go beyond
any reasonable response to fiction, no matter how genuinely
delightful that fiction happens to be. Instead, the current wave of
Harrymania brings the Potter series to a fever pitch better
associated with movie hype, major sports events and hot new
Christmas toys. And it has placed Rowling, already the golden goose
of publishing, in the dicey position of having to outdo herself
with a sequel written under huge commercial pressure at twice the
length of any of her previous books. We know what happens to talent
when the tie-ins hit the Happy Meals, and the stakes get this high.
</P>
<P>
   But Rowling, a kindred spirit to both Lewis Carroll and the
pre-Jar Jar Binks George Lucas, turns out to be a fantasist who
lives inside a thrillingly fertile imagination, mines it
ingeniously and plays entirely by her own rules. Talk about
supernatural tricks: she has turned this odds-defying new book into
everything it promised to be. As the midpoint in a projected
seven-book series, ``Goblet of Fire'' is exactly the big, clever,
vibrant, tremendously assured installment that gives shape and
direction to the whole undertaking and still somehow preserves the
material's enchanting innocence. This time Rowling offers her
clearest proof yet of what should have been wonderfully obvious:
what makes the Potter books so popular is the radically simple fact
that they're so good.
</P>
<P>
   It is not immediately clear that ``Goblet of Fire'' is a step
forward for the series, since it gets off to a shaky opening.
Displaying her only real Achilles' heel, Rowling starts the book
with a sinister, tacked-on prologue hinting at the whereabouts of
evil Lord Voldemort, who is the Darth Vader of this enterprise and
is so wicked that others fearfully refer to him as
``You-Know-Who.''
</P>
<P>
   When she cuts cinematically from this whiff of peril to Harry's
awakening with a start, she resorts to the kind of predictable
storytelling signals that her narrative doesn't need. When you can
dream up an idea like the Pensieve, a basin to hold one's excess
thoughts until they can be dealt with at leisure, or a household
clock that indicates family members' whereabouts (``home,''
``work,'' ``traveling,'' ``prison,'' ``mortal peril'') instead of
the mere time, there's no excuse for falling back on the humdrum.
</P>
<P>
   The new book starts off with some explaining to do (and handles
it expeditiously enough to be inviting and accessible to first-time
Potter readers). Then, like the three volumes before it, it rescues
Harry from his miserable foster parents (who this time will send
him a single tissue as a Christmas gift) and restores him to the
Weasley family, where he is warmly welcomed and where Mrs. Weasley
cooks dinner with the help of magic (``pointing her wand a little
more vigorously than she had intended at a pile of potatoes in the
sink, which shot out of their skins so fast that they ricocheted
off the walls and ceiling'').
</P>
<P>
   Harry and most of the Weasley children are headed for Hogwarts,
the academy of magic that Rowling has turned into the series' most
seductive attraction, what with mischievous, mobile portraits on
the walls and studies like Potions and Care of Magical Creatures.
Never has one author done so much to make readers of all ages long
to be at school.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But en route to Hogwarts, in a book that owes its expansive
length to many such alluring diversions, the Weasleys and Harry
stop at a kind of wizards' Woodstock. This huge outdoor event, at
which magical types pitch wildly fanciful tents but can't figure
out how to light matches, revolves around the World Cup Competition
in the game of Quidditch, which would by now be played on sandlots
and street corners everywhere if it did not require the use of
flying brooms. Typical of the heavenly whimsy that keeps the Potter
books so freewheeling is the catalog of souvenirs described here:
</P>
<P>
   ``There were luminous rosettes _ green for Ireland, red for
Bulgaria _ which were squealing the names of the players, pointed
green hats bedecked with dancing shamrocks, Bulgarian scarves
adorned with lions that really roared, flags from both countries
that played their national anthems as they were waved; there were
tiny models of Firebolts that really flew, and collectible figures
of famous players, which strolled across the palm of your hand,
preening themselves.'' Also Omnioculars, binoculars capable of
instant replay.
</P>
<P>
   The teams are cheered on, respectively, by tiny leprechauns in
the sky who align themselves in the shape of rude hand gestures
when Ireland is losing, and gorgeous blonde female creatures called
veela who develop the beaks and scaly wings of birds of prey when
they get angry. ``And  &UR; that &LR; , &UR;  &LR; boys,'' the Weasley father
announces, ``is why you should never go for looks alone!''
</P>
<P>
   Then it's on to Hogwarts, still the home of Rowling's most
irresistible characters and creations, like the Sorting Hat in
charge of assigning new students to each of the school's four
houses; to do this, the Hat perches on a stool, opens its brim and
begins singing. ``Sings a different one every year,'' remarks Ron,
the Weasley who is one of Harry's best friends. ``It's got to be a
pretty boring life, hasn't it, being a hat? I suppose it spends all
year making up the next one.'' Much of ``Goblet of Fire'' is
devoted to enriching the already witty, madly colorful portrait of
Hogwarts life that Rowling has continued to tweak merrily and has
not allowed to grow tired.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually it develops that Hogwarts will be engaged in a
special contest this year: a Triwizard Tournament that involves two
other schools, the stern Durmstrang and the rather more glamorous
Beauxbatons. Each will be represented by one participant in an
event that spans the entire school year and that, needless to say,
involves Harry on the Hogwarts side, complete with tabloid press
coverage that satirizes the treatment of Britain's schoolboy
princes. Rowling would be profoundly disappointing her readers if
she did not link the contest, with small clues salted all through
the narrative, to the complex and ominous machinations of
You-Know-Who and friends.
</P>
<P>
   The series' first book served primarily as an introduction,
though its intrigue involved a three-headed monster guarding the
Sorcerer's Stone of the title. Then, in the weaker ``Harry Potter
and the Chamber of Secrets,'' Rowling drifted into a ghastly
special effects denouement, replete with giant spiders, that
provided the books' most unappetizing scenario. With ``Harry Potter
and the Prisoner of Azkaban,'' she arrived at a more trickily
convoluted finale, to the point where you might have fried an egg
on the forehead of anyone trying to sort out the book's climactic
moves.
</P>
<P>
   This time she achieves her most lucid, well-plotted and exciting
conclusion, complete with a spectacular wand-on-wand confrontation
to recall Luke, Darth and their light sabers, enhanced by the
identity-twisting tricks in which Rowling specializes. The book
ends on a mournful note with the loss of one character, and with
ominous, cliff-hanging hints of a next installment. Two things seem
certain: it will involve giants and be awaited with justifiably
bated breath.
</P>
<P>
   Twice as hefty as its predecessors, ``Harry Potter and the
Goblet of Fire'' is an uncommonly good-looking book, with a
substantial feel and artful chapter illustrations that anticipate
the narrative. Today's readers are bound to appreciate that. Future
generations, for whom the Harry Potter books will be classics,
should like it, too.

`GEORGE: A FAMILY DOCUMENTARY': PORTRAIT CAPTURES INSIGHT INTO
TRIALS OF AUTISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a documentary that asks a great deal. It asks you to be
patient, for one thing, as you spend an hour and half in the
company of an articulate but oddly distracted boy who clearly has
no capacity for patience himself.
</P>
<P>
   Stick with it. This film, which begins with a series of
seemingly disjointed impressions, coalesces into a moving study of
the boy, his family and his condition. The more you know, the more
you care. The more you care, the more your heart will break.
</P>
<P>
   ``George: A Family Documentary,'' the film by Henry Corra and
Grahame Weinbren that HBO is showing Monday night, is Corra's
loving portrait and guilty apology to his autistic son, George.
Made in 1995, when the boy was 12 and his father gave him a
videocamera for his birthday, it intersperses bits of George's own
monologues and quirky interviews with his father's professional
sequences and quirky interviews.
</P>
<P>
   At first George, handsome and energetic, seems no different from
any boy his age. But when he starts to share his passion for planes
and recites his storehouse of statistics about every type of
airliner, the distinctions begin to come into focus. Although he
must be reminded to look people in the eye when speaking to them,
he has no trouble addressing his own camera head-on with random
information like the day's weather forecast.
</P>
<P>
   His father's camera follows George on a real flying lesson
(``That was great,'' he says) and on a visit to the United Nations,
where he can name the country represented by every flag flying
outside.
</P>
<P>
   The camera also trails him at his special school, where his
classmates share with Corra their observations on being different
themselves. Thrilled at the prospect of being on television, they
perform a song, written by one of the students, that describes
their lives as being ``caught between a rock and a hard place.''
</P>
<P>
   If this weren't all bittersweet enough, Henry Corra gets word
that HBO has decided to withdraw from the project because George
does not seem ``autistic enough.'' (Corra vows to press on.) And
hovering over the film is the figure of George's uncle Tom Corra.
He plays melancholy music on his cello and talks about the boy, who
can deal with endless facts but ``not concepts that have to do with
interrelationships, especially of human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is dedicated to the memory of Tom Corra, who died in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The months covered by the documentary also include the decision
by George's parents to separate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not, you're not gonna stay with us anymore,'' the boy,
eyes fixed on a videogame, says to his father in an uninflected
statement. But it is quickly followed by an anguished question,
``Not anymore?''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking off-screen, Henry Corra admits that to escape his own
distress over George's autism, he kept diving ever deeper into his
work. At least that work ultimately helped bring the two of them
closer, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Only toward the end does the film bring out the talking heads to
help the viewer begin to make sense of all this, including a
psychologist who speaks of the sensory overload the autistic must
bear. But that burden is not totally negative, says Mark Ramoser,
an autistic adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see and hear things that the rest of you might have to have
pointed out,'' he says, things like the sound of a brook or the
grain pattern in a piece of wood. ``I gather most of you
neuro-typicals barely even notice that.''
</P>
<P>
   Much is left unexplained by ``George.'' You're left to wonder
what has happened to the family members since 1995. And you're left
to wonder what led the neuro-typicals at HBO to show the film now,
and at an inconvenient hour.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is much to be learned from this documentary. Yes,
some of its concepts are difficult to process. But that just may be
the whole point.

 &HT;    Fans receive a double dose of hunka burnin' Latin love
 &HT;    By Shane Harrison
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Unless your ceiling is the underside of a rock, you
probably know that Latin pop has made a serious dent in the
mainstream music charts in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that chart action has been generated by the tropical
triumvirate of testosterone: Ricky Martin, Marc Anthony and Enrique
Iglesias. Let's take a look at the accomplishments and relative
merits of these two superstars.
</P>
<P>
   WHO, WHEN, WHERE
</P>
<P>
   Anthony: Born Marco Antonio Muniz to Puerto Rican parents in New
York on Sept. 16, 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Martin: Born Enrique Martin: Morales in San Juan, Puerto Rico,
on Dec. 24, 1971.
</P>
<P>
   THE HITS
</P>
<P>
   Anthony: The salsa-flavored ``I Need to Know'' and the current
Top 20 hit ``You Sang to Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin: ``She's All I Ever Had,'' ``Shake Your Bon-Bon'' and the
ubiquitous ``Livin' la Vida Loca.''
</P>
<P>
   THE ALBUMS
</P>
<P>
   Anthony: His first three albums (``Otra Nota,'' ``Todo a Su
Tiempo'' and ``Contra la Corriente'') were solid salsa affairs. His
latest release is his double-platinum, self-titled English-language
debut, which supplied the hits.
</P>
<P>
   Martin: His Spanish-language debut, like his later
English-language debut, was titled ``Ricky Martin.'' That was
followed by ``Me Amaras'' and ``A Medio Vivir.'' With ``Vuelve,''
and the World Cup anthem ``La Copa de la Vida,'' Martin began
making inroads into the pop mainstream. After a galvanizing
performance of that tune at the 1998 World Cup, the buzz became
deafening in the weeks leading up to the release of his first
English-language album.
</P>
<P>
   THE LATIN GRAMMYS
</P>
<P>
   Anthony: In the first-ever nominations for these awards, he
scored five nods _ including Record of the Year for ``I Need to
Know.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin: He was nominated in two categories, including Record of
the Year for ``Livin' la Vida Loca.''
</P>
<P>
   THE EARLY YEARS
</P>
<P>
   Anthony: Before releasing his first album in 1993, Anthony was
performing with Little Louie Vega. His first chart appearance (on
Billboard's dance chart) was on a recording with Vega called ``Ride
on the Rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin: From age 12 to 16, Martin was part of Latin factory boy
band Menudo.
</P>
<P>
   THESPIAN EXPLOITS
</P>
<P>
   Anthony: He played the lead in Paul Simon's short-run Broadway
musical ``The Capeman.'' He has also appeared in the movies
``Bringing Out the Dead,'' ``Hackers'' and ``Big Night.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin: A luxuriantly coiffed Martin played Miguel on the
daytime drama ``General Hospital,'' made stage appearances in
Mexico and had a role in ``Les Miserables'' on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   THE HUNKA BURNIN' LOVE FACTOR
</P>
<P>
   Anthony: From the February issue of Cosmopolitan: ``Although
(he) might not be tall and brooding like Enrique Iglesias or
chiseled and swivelicious like Ricky Martin, he has a fierce
following of devoted fans _ most of them female. Chalk it up to a
mixture of guy-next-door accessibility, smoldering sexuality, and a
willingness not to take himself too seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin: He possesses the most celebrated hip-swivel since Elvis
Presley shocked the nation on ``The Ed Sullivan Show'' in the
1950s. Martin's days on ``General Hospital'' inspired much
swooning.
</P>
<P>
   ISN'T IT ROMANTIC?
</P>
<P>
   Anthony: On May 9, he married former Miss Universe Dayanara
Torres. The wedding took place in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Martin: Speculation about his sexuality runs rampant, abetted by
his coyness about his personal life in interviews. He has been
linked with Mexican television personality Rebecca de Alba.
</P>
<P>
   THE BOTTOM LINE
</P>
<P>
   Anthony: With three albums of hot salsa to his name, Anthony
wins the rootsy authenticity sweepstakes, for what it's worth. His
vocal dexterity and soulful delivery are what really give him the
edge.
</P>
<P>
   Martin: Martin's music has always been pop, through and through
_ not that there's anything wrong with that. The Latin flavor is
there in more than the Spanish words, but he's a pop star in any
language. His voice is not the most versatile instrument, but he
and his producers know what material works best for him. His
greatest asset is his seemingly boundless energy and enthusiasm _
along with that marvelous mug and his widely worshipped bon-bon.

to begin broadcasting in Spanish this evening.
</P>
<P>
   WSB's 6 p.m. news will be available in Spanish seven days a
week, thanks to translators, some new equipment and a rarely used
feature found on most televisions made after 1980. To hear the
Spanish broadcasts, viewers will press a button on their remote
control that turns on Second Audio Program (SAP), which lets a
station broadcast different sound _ usually a language other than
English _ along with its regular picture.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to deliver news, weather and sports to
Spanish-speakers and to attract revenue from companies eager to
advertise to Hispanics, says Ray Carter, WSB news director. The
station, for now, is paying the translators and covering the cost
of the equipment (together about $75,000 to $100,000 a year) but is
searching for sponsors, Carter says.
</P>
<P>
   A translator sitting in the WSB newsroom will follow along on a
TelePrompTer as anchors read their scripts and will translate
simultaneously as reporters in the field tell their stories. The
station will run brief notices telling viewers to turn on SAP to
hear the news in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The chief translator will be Maddie Pimentel, former spokeswoman
for the Latin American Association, with others assisting, Carter
says.
</P>
<P>
   Pimentel worked with WSB giving brief news reports in Spanish
during January's severe ice storm. The station did the same during
tornadoes and hurricanes last year. After the ice storm reports,
station executives met with about 40 Hispanic leaders, who reported
that Spanish-speaking viewers wanted general news in Spanish, not
just information about happenings in their ethnic community.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to be involved in the community, and having access
to the information in a language they're comfortable with is an
excellent way,'' says Jeffery Tapia, associate director of metro
Atlanta's Latin American Association.
</P>
<P>
   Says Carter: ``It's a great opportunity to bring revenue into
the station, have it pay for itself and serve the community.
There's a loyal customer base sitting out there waiting to be
tapped.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta TV market, which covers 50 counties, includes about
50,500 Hispanic households with televisions, or 158,000 people,
says Karen Kratz, a Nielsen Media Research spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   WSB's translations are among the first visible signs that local
TV stations are trying to capture Hispanic viewers. WXIA executives
in January said they plan to tailor some broadcasts to
Spanish-speakers but declined to give details. WAGA aired a weekly
show in Spanish, called ``Latin Atlanta,'' until the early 1990s,
and its news director has said he is considering having reporters
read news summaries in Spanish or Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Television stations in California, New Mexico and Utah have
broadcast news in Spanish using SAP for years, Carter says, while
stations in Austin, Texas, and Washington recently began doing so.
A few prime-time shows broadcast in Spanish on the SAP channel; HBO
does it for all programming.

 &HT;    Venus generates media flurry
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke

<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Richard Williams might have called it
``Venus' Party'' on his hand-written sign, but she didn't have much
time for the celebration after winning her first Grand Slam title
at Wimbledon on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams turned into a media belle the moment she leapt in
victory at Centre Court. Photographers immediately started
recording images that would fill the morning papers in London,
across the ocean in their U.S. home and all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Many headlines in England played on Venus' first name. ``Venus
In Orbit'' read the front of the Sunday Times' sports section,
while the Sunday Mirror called her ``Venus de Smile'' and
``Victory-V. Venus on a different planet as she wins it by a
smile.''
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as the trophies had been awarded Venus and runner-up
Lindsay Davenport, the interviews began for Venus. She handled 15
engagements for 11 individual media outlets, plus a group interview
and group photo shoot for everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Her television obligations included the BBC, NBC, Turner, ESPN
and stations from South America, Germany and Spain. She also talked
with USA Today and Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   That ended her work on Saturday and she was free to continue
hugging her trophy or to eat a good meal or celebrate in any other
way.
</P>
<P>
   But she wasn't free much more 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   By 10 a.m., Venus and sister Serena Williams _ a singles
semifinalist ousted by Venus and doubles finalist with Venus _ were
due on the golf course across the street from the club to do an
interview via satellite for a Sky News show called ``Sunday with
Boulton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very big thing in London,'' said WTA spokeswoman
Raquel Martin, who is based in Europe. ``He talks to the biggest
politicians and celebrities.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the sisters went to a house in Wimbledon village
owned by IMG to tape a segment for ``Good Morning, America'' that
will air this morning. They spent about 15 minutes there, then
returned to the club grounds for a joint session with a company
that does an annual Wimbledon documentary for the tournament's
museum.
</P>
<P>
   They finished about noon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then Venus went to buy shoes for the ball,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Venus named the fact that she bought a gown for the famed
Wimbledon Champions Dinner before she left Palm Beach Gardens as
motivation for her victory here. She wouldn't reveal details about
the dress _ except that it has beads _ but hoped to show it off at
the 10:30 p.m. ball Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It was held at the Savoy Hotel in central London, considered one
of the city's ``poshest'' hotels. Singles finalists each received a
table so the Williams' entourage all was expected. Others among the
approximately 400 invited included All England Club members, former
singles champions, seniors participants and the presidents of the
international tennis federations.
</P>
<P>
   But if Venus and Serena went, they probably didn't stay long.
The doubles final they had expected to play Sunday afternoon was
postponed until today because of heavy rain that delayed the men's
final between Pete Sampras and Patrick Rafter for hours.
</P>
<P>
   That match ended four minutes before 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the eighth-seeded Williams sisters will play fourth seeds
Julie Halard-Decugis and Ai Sugiyama at noon today. They'll be
seeking another history-making day, as they try to become the first
all-black doubles team to win Wimbledon.

U.N. AGREES TO BETTER PROTECT SERBS IN KOSOVO, AS STRAINS THREATEN
COHESION

<P>
   GRACANICA, Kosovo _ The first agreement between the Serbs and
the U.N. administration here may provide some better protection for
the Serbian minority, but threatens to unravel key Albanian
participation and Western hopes for a multi-ethnic Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Maneuvering by the province's majority Albanians and the Serbs
is intensifying ahead of municipal elections scheduled for October.
The international administration here hopes this ballot will be the
first step toward cutting Kosovo loose from its foreign lifelines;
so far, however, almost no Serbs have registered to vote.
</P>
<P>
   And Albanian leaders jostling for power in Kosovo's majority
community also seem to be increasingly willing to fight out their
differences on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   A year into the effort to rebuild Kosovo, many in the U.N.
administration say they are wearying of the recalcitrance of
Albanian leaders. They are also under new pressure to better
protect the Serb minority against persistent attacks, especially
the more openly cooperative Serbs grouped around religious leaders,
Bishop Artemije and Father Sava, who are based at the early
14th-century monastery here.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration in particular has negotiated with
Artemije to convince him to join the executive council established
by Bernard Kouchner, the chief U.N. administrator. The bishop's
decision to do so was viewed as traitorous by the government of
Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade and by a rival Kosovo Serb grouping
led from the northern town of Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   Some formal participation by Serbs is considered vital to the
success of the Western effort to restructure Kosovo as a
democratic, self-governing entity where all ethnic groups can live
peacefully _ even if separated into enclaves behind barbed wire and
guarded by foreign peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   And there is pressure from Washington to begin the return to
Kosovo of at least some Serbs who fled Albanian revenge when NATO's
bombing war against Yugoslavia ended a year ago, enabling hundreds
of thousands of Albanians driven from home by the Serbs to return.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is eager to promote the bishop and his Serbian
National Council over the harder-line Mitrovica Serbs led by Oliver
Ivanovic, who is more closely, if not definitively, allied with
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, after Artemije protested increased attacks on Serbs
last month by walking out of Kouchner's council, the Clinton
administration helped his group of Serbs and the United Nations to
negotiate an agreement on security for the Serbian minority that
coaxed the bishop back in, at least for another three months. It
was the first direct accord between the United Nations and Kosovar
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no other choice but to participate,'' said Father
Sava, the bishop's aide and spokesman. ``We cannot live on rhetoric
and criticism, but we have to give our own constructive
contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   The memorandum drew fierce protest from other Serbs, nearly
every Kosovo Albanian party and the government of neighboring
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Hashim Thaci, once the leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army and
now head of the Democratic Party of Kosovo, himself withdrew from
U.N. organizations, at least ``temporarily,'' on July 4, just
before attending a party at the American diplomatic mission here.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci says the agreement, which he first read about in
newspapers, ``opens the door'' to the partition of Kosovo into
separate ethnic enclaves. What bothers him most, his aides say, is
not Gracanica, and its Serbs, but partitioned Mitrovica, which is
divided into a Serb-dominated north and Albanian-dominated south,
and where the River Ibar still marks the effective beginning of
Serbia proper. The actual border is a few miles to the north.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian Mitrovica remains a neuralgic point for Albanians.
Thaci's aides say that Kouchner and the NATO officers who lead the
peacekeeping force here may mean well, but are naive and open to
Serbian manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, U.N. and NATO officials admit privately that it is
becoming less likely that the West will act forcefully to end the
partition of Mitrovica, and therefore of Kosovo itself, because of
the risk to alliance troops and the fear that it would drive
thousands more Serbs from the province.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement with Artemije, the United Nations promises
to improve the safety and freedom of movement of Serbs by
developing a special police task force for Serb enclaves; to get
more Serbs, particularly those nominated by the bishop, into
Kosovo's multi-ethnic police force; to promote the return of Serbs,
find more Serb and international judges to adjudicate crimes and
disputes and, crucially, to establish up to 20 ``local community
offices'' in Serb areas.
</P>
<P>
   Albanians criticize the special offices and arrangements for
Kosovo Serbs, saying that they undermine the principle of a unified
and multi-ethnic Kosovo. But Father Sava points to Albanian attacks
on Serbs that make enclaves necessary, and notes that if the U.N.
and NATO peacekeepers do not deliver, the position of Gracanica's
Serbs will be further undermined.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner stresses that every institution is ultimately under his
control. He admits that he did not consult Thaci or other Albanian
leaders, saying that he has always dealt with security issues as
his responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I have always been on the side of those who
suffer,'' Kouchner said. ``Earlier they were the Albanians, but now
it is the Serbs and members of other communities.''
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Kouchner suggested that Thaci is losing popularity
and needed to stand up to the United Nations, although he conceded
there are deeper issues at stake. He noted that Ibrahim Rugova, the
more moderate and passive Albanian leader of the Democratic League
of Kosovo, has not left the council.
</P>
<P>
   The aide predicted that the summer months, leading up to the
first elections in post-war Kosovo, are likely to be marked by more
violence, especially among the Albanian parties.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Thaci's followers and those of Ramush Haradinaj, a
former KLA commander who heads another rival party, the Alliance
for the Future of Kosovo, have been attacking each other, as well
as Rugova's followers. In one such attack early Friday, Haradinaj
and his brother were themselves wounded in an exchange of gun fire
with Rugova supporters in the village of Stroece, near Pec.
Haradinaj, the third former KLA leader attacked in recent weeks,
was flown on Sunday to an American military hospital in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing violence _ both intra-Albanian and inter-ethnic _
has depressed U.N. workers struggling to build a new Kosovo with
limited resources. ``There is mission fatigue,'' said one senior
official. ``But there is also Albanian fatigue.''

BOMBS IN SOUTHERN RUSSIA KILL 7; OFFICIALS DOUBT LINK TO CHECHEN
REBELS

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ One week after Chechen rebels killed 33 Russian
soldiers in a wave of truck-bomb attacks, two smaller bombs killed
seven civilians Sunday in southern Russian provinces close to
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   No one claimed responsibility for the bombings, but the
locations strongly suggested ties to guerrilla forces inside
Chechnya, who said last week that they intended to carry their
terror campaign outside the war zone.
</P>
<P>
   Five people died and 17 more were wounded in the largest blast,
in the central market at Vladikavkaz, the same market at which a
huge explosion killed 50 people in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The city, in North Ossetia about 30 miles from the Chechnya
border, is a regular stopping point for Russian troops and
commanders involved in the Chechen conflict. President Vladimir
Putin met with his military commanders in North Ossetia last week
to demand greater security in the wake of the truck bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The independent NTV television network said the bomb was stuffed
with metal fragments and apparently contained about a half-pound of
TNT. The state-run RTR network said the bomb had been hidden under
a car near the market.
</P>
<P>
   A second explosion, apparently a bomb hidden in a purse, killed
two shopkeepers and injured two others in the Black Sea port of
Rostov-on-Don. One person was killed instantly when he tried to
open the purse, which had been left in a plastic bag outside the
shop.
</P>
<P>
   Rostov, about 325 miles northwest of Chechnya, is another
stopping point for the Russian military and the headquarters of a
powerful new representative of the Kremlin, Viktor Kazantsev, whom
Putin appointed last month to oversee federal affairs in the
Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   Rostov's deputy mayor told Echo Moskvy, the city's news radio
station, that he doubted that the blast was the work of Chechen
guerrillas, but that little would be known until a police inquiry
was completed in a day or two.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic rebels fighting a rear-guard action against Russian
forces have repeatedly threatened to carry the war outside
Chechnya's borders. The Kremlin accuses them of starting the war by
engineering the terrorist bombings of apartment houses in Moscow
and elsewhere last autumn, killing hundreds of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the threats, attacks outside Chechnya have generally
been both small and sporadic. The most destructive this year
occurred in Ingushetia, a province adjoining Chechnya, when
guerrillas ambushed and decimated a convoy of about 20 Russian
soldiers moving through a forest just a few miles from the Chechen
border.
</P>
<P>
   Russian leaders, from Putin down, have been declaring the
Chechen war over and the province pacified since last February. But
ambushes and nighttime exchanges of fire remain common, and most
outside experts believe the region is destined to suffer a long war
of attrition.

 &HT;    NAACP TO HOST PRESIDENTIAL RIVALS
 &HT;    Moving in the (a) National and (p) politics categories.

   BALTIMORE _ As Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W.
Bush come before the NAACP's national convention here this week,
Bush remains at a clear disadvantage in seeking to woo African
American voters in November.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the likely Republican nominee, ``has a harder row to hoe''
than Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee, NAACP President
Kweisi Mfume said Sunday on the eve of the governor's speech to the
nation's oldest and largest civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Bond, the chairman of the NAACP, echoed Mfume's
</P>
<P>
   words, contending that Bush ``has an enormous amount of
baggage'' that he carries into the coming campaign, mostly as a
result of the positions and political tactics his party has taken
in past years.
</P>
<P>
   ``African Americans, like all Americans, have long memories,''
Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   Just how hard it will be for Bush to cut into black support for
Gore was apparent as protesters clad in woolen Confederate Army
grey waved the Confederate flag outside the NAACP's convention
during a rally sponsored by the newly formed Southern Party of
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Bond called the flag ``a Confederate swastika'' and vowed that
the organization will continue its boycott of South Carolina, which
recently relocated the Confederate flag from atop the state capitol
to less prominent location on the statehouse grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, during the Republican presidential primary in South
Carolina, said the Confederate flag was a matter for South
Carolinians alone to decide.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bush's first campaign appearance in South Carolina
was at Bob Jones University, a fundamentalist school that, at the
time, still maintained a long-standing policy of banning
interracial dating. The policy since been ended.
</P>
<P>
   But the Confederate flag flap, which initially overshadowed his
message of political inclusion, is not the only issue that is going
to make it difficult for Bush to lure African American votes away
from Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor also opposes affirmative action as a remedy
to racial bias. And he has rejected a moratorium on the death
penalty, an issue that arose with the recent execution of Texas
inmate Gary Graham. The NAACP called the execution ``a grave
travesty of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Gore defends affirmative action as a legitimate
tool for combating discrimination. And early on, he advocated the
removal of the Confederate flag from all public accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice president, like Bush, also opposes a death penalty
moratorium - one issue that ``we're at odds'' with him on, said
Mfume.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Mfume said the Republican Party ``can make inroads''
with African American voters despite the party's recent history of
ignoring blacks and employing political tactics calculated to turn
white voters against the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's appearance before the NAACP convention apparently signals
at least an end to the party turning its back to African American
voters. Bob Dole, the GOP's presidential nominee in 1996, snubbed
the NAACP's national convention, charging that Mfume was ``trying
to set me up.'' Dole later said his decision was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said the Texas governor expects ``a
polite reception'' from the NAACP delegates Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Mfume said Bush ``obviously doesn't think this is a setup.'' He
added, ``We want to hear what compassionate conservatism really is.
We are interested in compassionate commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past two weeks, Bush has sought to raise his profile
among minorities. He spoke last week to two major Hispanic
organizations, the League of United Latin American Citizens and the
National Council of La Raza.
</P>
<P>
   And two weeks ago, he appeared before a conservative black
organization, the Congress of Racial Equality, giving a speech that
might have been a rehearsal for his address to the NAACP. He spoke
about a ``school liberation movement,'' tax cuts, economic
empowerment and, most tellingly, his view that racism remains a
fact of life in American society. Such an approach is in sharp
contrast to the ``color blind'' rhetoric of affirmative action
foes.
</P>
<P>
   But Bond suggested that African Americans want more than
campaign rhetoric window dressing from Bush. ``We don't want to be
a back drop,'' he said, referring to the frequency of news
photographs showing the Texas governor with African American
children.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the NAACP volunteers have already registered about
2.8 million new voters since last July, according to Mfume, about
70 percent of the 4 million voters they hope to register in time
for the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bush's courtship of African American voters, Gore holds
a commanding lead among African American voters. A recent NBC/Wall
Street Journal poll showed Gore with 71 percent of the black vote,
compared to 17 percent for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for Gore's standing with African Americans is
President Clinton, one of the most popular political figures ever
in the African American community. Clinton is scheduled to address
the convention Tuesday, the day before Gore's appearance.

   But the Confederate flag flap, which initially overshadowed his
message of political inclusion, is not the only issue that is going
to make it difficult for Bush to lure African American votes away
from Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor also opposes affirmative action as a remedy
to racial bias. And he has rejected a moratorium on the death
penalty, an issue that arose with the recent execution of Texas
inmate Gary Graham. The NAACP called the execution ``a grave
travesty of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Gore defends affirmative action as a legitimate
tool for combating discrimination. And early on, he advocated the
removal of the Confederate flag from all public accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice president, like Bush, also opposes a death penalty
moratorium - one issue that ``we're at odds'' with him on, said
Mfume.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Mfume said the Republican Party ``can make inroads''
with African American voters despite the party's recent history of
ignoring blacks and employing political tactics calculated to turn
white voters against the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's appearance before the NAACP convention apparently signals
at least an end to the party turning its back to African American
voters. Bob Dole, the GOP's presidential nominee in 1996, snubbed
the NAACP's national convention, charging that Mfume was ``trying
to set me up.'' Dole later said his decision was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said the Texas governor expects ``a
polite reception'' from the NAACP delegates Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Mfume said Bush ``obviously doesn't think this is a setup.'' He
added, ``We want to hear what compassionate conservatism really is.
We are interested in compassionate commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past two weeks, Bush has sought to raise his profile
among minorities. He spoke last week to two major Hispanic
organizations, the League of United Latin American Citizens and the
National Council of La Raza.
</P>
<P>
   And two weeks ago, he appeared before a conservative black
organization, the Congress of Racial Equality, giving a speech that
might have been a rehearsal for his address to the NAACP. He spoke
about a ``school liberation movement,'' tax cuts, economic
empowerment and, most tellingly, his view that racism remains a
fact of life in American society. Such an approach is in sharp
contrast to the ``color blind'' rhetoric of affirmative action
foes.
</P>
<P>
   But Bond suggested that African Americans want more than
campaign rhetoric window dressing from Bush. ``We don't want to be
a back drop,'' he said, referring to the frequency of news
photographs showing the Texas governor with African American
children.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the NAACP volunteers have already registered about
2.8 million new voters since last July, according to Mfume, about
70 percent of the 4 million voters they hope to register in time
for the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bush's courtship of African American voters, Gore holds
a commanding lead among African American voters. A recent NBC/Wall
Street Journal poll showed Gore with 71 percent of the black vote,
compared to 17 percent for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for Gore's standing with African Americans is
President Clinton, one of the most popular political figures ever
in the African American community. Clinton is scheduled to address
the convention Tuesday, the day before Gore's appearance.

   It is going to change everything, they say. A new wave of
technology will put the world at people's fingertips. Pundits speak
breathlessly of checking stock quotes, sending e-mail messages,
even buying books at the touch of the button. And investors are
racing to buy into the companies making it happen.
</P>
<P>
   Sound like the Internet in 1995? Indeed it does. But today all
the same hope and promotion are directed at a new generation of
services offered through cellular telephones, pagers and myriad
other radio-wave gizmos. All that is missing is a glossy magazine
to chronicle it all, called, say, Unwired.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the wireless Internet will spread even more
quickly than the wired one. That is because, from now on, nearly
every cell phone sold will have standard Web-browser software built
in. Adapting existing Web sites for use by these wireless browsers
is a relatively small additional expense. And thanks to the wired
Internet, tens of millions of people are already in the habit of
communicating electronically; the transition to wireless access
should seem but a natural next step to them.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the analogies to the wired Internet, it is likely to
be much harder to create services for wireless devices that are
easy, useful and profitable than it has been for the wired world.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, slow speeds, tiny screens and tortured methods of
entering text can make surfing the Net on a cell phone about as
satisfying an experience as reading a newspaper on a ticker tape
would be. And while the browser software does not add to the price
of a phone, most carriers charge users extra fees and per-minute
rates to send or receive data.
</P>
<P>
   As for devices like two-way pagers and Palm hand-held computers,
which have bigger screens and easier ways to enter text, the
hardware and monthly service fees are even more costly than the
cell phone services.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, it is not clear how much business can be done
when it takes five minutes and 100 clicks to make an airplane
reservation wirelessly. And whatever limitations banner
advertisements may have on the Internet, they are Hollywood
productions compared with the possibilities on a cell phone screen
that shows four lines with a maximum of 22 text characters a line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies who are marketing this as the Web in your pocket
are overpromising by a long shot and well could sour the market,''
said Seamus McAteer, an analyst for Jupiter Communications. ``A lot
of the stuff on the Web just doesn't translate to a wireless device
today. A kid just isn't going to do research for his homework on a
cell phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Wireless proponents argue that people love their mobility so
much that they will put up with expensive, hard-to-use data
services, just asthey tolerate the static and cost of cell phones
themselves. They point to the mobs of teen-agers in Japan and
Finland using cell phones to send wireless love notes with their
thumbs.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, for one, is making a big bet that the most
popular application on wireless phones, as on its computer service,
will be buddy lists and instant messages.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, proponents argue that in the future technology will
allow bigger screens, faster data and some sort of easy way to
enter text _ possibly voice recognition. And they envision
complementary uses, PCs at home for detailed information searches
and exchanges and small wireless devices for terse updates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things that people will do on mobile devices will be
completely different than on the Web,'' said Naveen Jain, chairman
of Infospace, a company that operates parts of the mobile data
service offered by carriers like AT&AMP;T and Verizon Wireless. ``You
want utilitarian, personalized and actionable information.''

   Wireless Internet services have been available for several
years, first in the form of radio modems for laptops that were
mainly used by corporations that wanted to stay in touch with their
traveling sales force. More recently, two-way pagers, like the
Blackberry, made by Research in Motion, have become a status item
for executives who want to send e-mail on the run.
</P>
<P>
   The first mass-market wireless data service was over the Palm
VII, a version of 3Com's popular organizer introduced a year ago
with a wireless modem built in. So far, the Palm has attracted
somewhat more than 100,000 wireless customers. More important, it
has attracted a host of developers creating wireless services.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, for example, lets wireless Palm VII users search its
huge selection of books and other products, read user comments and
order with their one-click accounts. Web portals, including Yahoo
and Excite at Home's Excite, enable wireless users to tap into
services like e-mail and stock quotes. Other companies, like
Omnisky and Go America, have introduced online services and clip-on
modems that can provide wireless connections for existing hand-held
devices.
</P>
<P>
   But experts predict that wireless access on hand-held computers
will be overshadowed by the use of cell phones. Sprint PCS
introduced its Wireless Web service last November. It says a third
of its 7 million phones are now capable of browsing wireless Web
sites and more than a million have. Last month, AT&AMP;T introduced a
similar service and Monday Verizon, which was formed by the
combination of Bell Atlantic AirTouch and GTE and is the nation's
largest wireless carrier, plans to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with customer turnover and price wars, the carriers hope
data services can help restore their profit margins. But they are
taking sharply divergent approaches to designing and pricing their
data services.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Sprint and Verizon, see wireless data as a major
source of new revenue. They charge customers a monthly fee of $7 to
$10 to gain access to data services and then a per-minute fee for
each minute spent surfing or talking, with a set number included
with the monthly service plan.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has a very different model. For customers who buy a new
Web-enabled phone, the company will give unlimited free access to
some 40 information and commerce sites. AT&AMP;T customers who want to
use e-mail must pay $7 a month, and customers who want both e-mail
and the freedom to go to other wireless sites of their own choosing
must pay $15 a month. But there is no per-minute charge on either
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Much like an advertising-supported Web site, AT&AMP;T intends to
earn money from its free service through commissions from the sales
Web sites make to AT&AMP;T's Web-phone users. It also hopes that users
whose appetites are whetted by the free service can be persuaded to
upgrade to the pay services.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear, though, how customers will react to AT&AMP;T's free
offer as they discover that the wireless Internet the company
promises does not include leading services like AOL and Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the carriers want to be the control points,'' said
Mohan Vishwanath, vice president of Yahoo's mobile unit. ``But we
all know that if anything is going to grow at the rate of the
Internet, it has to be open.''
</P>
<P>
   The other carriers are not limiting access, but they are
nonetheless charging Web sites fees to be listed in prominent
positions in their cramped on-screen menus. Recently, America
Online supplanted Yahoo as the top item on Sprint's menu after
reportedly agreeing to a sizable payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the first several positions are of great value, and
we have charged for it,'' said John Garcia, Sprint marketing
director. He declined to discuss details of the payments.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia did say, though, that Sprint is not yet sure how crucial
such payments will be to its business overall. ``The most important
thing now is how many minutes we rack up,'' he said. But over time,
the company may experiment with services in which advertisements
and commissions subsidize some or all of the air time, as AT&AMP;T is
doing.
</P>
<P>
   Some Web site operators are bristling at the demands for
payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe in paying tremendous amounts to get listed,''
said Ali Hussein, the marketing director for Amazon.com's wireless
service. ``There is a definite benefit to the carriers to have
Amazon's brand and features on their service.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, nearly every major Web site is developing a wireless
version of its service and is paying whatever it takes to be on as
many menus as possible. Amazon, for example, has reached deals for
prominent display on Sprint and Verizon's service, but not on
AT&AMP;T's.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear just how much Internet sites might benefit
from these wireless deals. For now, the sites primarily want to
retain their customers who happen to use wireless services, even if
there is no immediate revenue to be gained.
</P>
<P>
   Travelocity.com, the online travel service, will soon allow
people to make reservations from a cell phone, though it expects
people will not want to do that very often. More valuable, perhaps,
as a convenience to its most profitable business travelers, is the
new system Travelocity has developed that will let travelers change
their return flights with just a few clicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to use a phone to say `Where should I go for
a cruise?''' said Terrell B. Jones, chief executive of Travelocity.
``But if you are in a meeting that is running long, wouldn't you
like to use your phone to pull up your reservation and click a
button marked `Later?'''
</P>
<P>
   So far there are no banner ads on wireless services, but the Web
sites are looking for ways to weave advertising in somewhere.
Yahoo, for example, offers a service that will send brief news,
weather or sports reports to users' phones, and those messages are
sponsored by advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ZDnet, the technology information site, will also soon weave
some advertising into the text of its articles about computers and
technology that users read wirelessly. Later, ZDnet hopes to earn
fees from referring customers to computer stores.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the wireless strategy for most Web sites is to become
big fast and figure out how to make money later.
</P>
<P>
   See? It does sound like the Internet all over again, doesn't it?

AT A CROSSROADS, PEOPLESOFT BETS ON THE FUTURE OF INTERNET-BASED
SOFTWARE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Investors, clients and competitors are
wondering: Will PeopleSoft's newest product, a software rooted to
the Internet, lead to the demise or revival of the once highflying
company? The answer may become clearer on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference in New York, PeopleSoft plans to show the
latest version of its ``enterprise software,'' a huge and complex
program that companies use to automate dozens of tasks, like
managing customer relations and human resources, sales support and
marketing efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the newest version is that it will be Internet-based,
meaning company employees and customers can use the program with an
ordinary Web browser, instead of tapping into an internal corporate
software program.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, PeopleSoft's release is months behind the
Internet-centric releases of its competitors and the industry's
market share leaders, Oracle and SAP. Plus, PeopleSoft is coming
off a disappointing year of flat revenue and a falling stock price
_ after years of double-digit growth _ and a management overhaul
that moved the company's founder, David A. Duffield, out of the
chief executive position, leaving him as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   PeopleSoft shares closed at $18.375 on Friday, a drop of over 30
percent since January. Adding to the company's challenges, a
shareholder lawsuit, filed on June 30 in Alameda County Court in
California, accuses company officials of insider trading. The
company declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   But PeopleSoft said its two-and-a-half year development of the
new version will signal a rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could shift the landscape,'' said Craig A. Conway, who in
May 1999 replaced Duffield as chief executive. He predicted the
overhauled software will provide a resurgence for PeopleSoft
against Oracle and SAP. ``We've got an ace up our sleeve,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   That trump card consists of additional features to the software
that the company gambled a significant portion of its budget
developing, he said. The features include 50 highly targeted
programs like Internet-based support for company technicians and
sales people, and Internet-based customer scorecards for clients.
</P>
<P>
   Partly in anticipation of the release, Lehman Brothers raised
its rating of PeopleSoft to ``outperform,'' up from ``neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   But more generally, industry analysts say it remains to be seen
whether PeopleSoft, based in Pleasanton, Calif., can revive its
fortunes and catch Oracle, also based in northern California, and
SAP, of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Exact market share figures are difficult to come by, because
each company has different definitions of what constitutes
enterprise software. SAP says it has 18,000 enterprise software
customers, Oracle claims 8,500 and PeopleSoft 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas P. Berquist, senior electronic commerce analyst with
Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., said that of the 55 competitors in the field,
SAP leads with 10,000, Oracle follows with 6,000 and PeopleSoft has
3,000.
</P>
<P>
   More generally, analysts say much remains undecided in an
industry that has undergone fundamental change in the last three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Berquist said the industry peaked in 1997 with about $35 billion
in revenue. Since then, the industry has languished at between $25
and $30 billion in revenue, and he and other analysts say that one
main reason for the drop-off was the Y2K glitch.
</P>
<P>
   The theory goes that many companies last year simply stopped
buying enterprise software _ which can cost hundreds of thousands
to hundreds of millions of dollars _ when they realized they could
not have it in place and tested in time for any possible millennium
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   A second factor was that the makers of this software _ led by
Oracle, which pushed the idea early on _ promised a new generation
of programs run entirely over the Internet. They said the upgrade
would be profound because companies would be able to provide
essential software to employees without the company ever having to
configure their individual computers.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, when employees wanted to file an expense form, check
product updates, look into their retirement portfolio or contact
suppliers, they would do so by logging into an Internet site on
which all the information was kept. Oracle said that it saved $1
billion on operating expenses last year by using its own
Internet-based software internally.
</P>
<P>
   This shift to Internet-based software from so-called
client-server based software _ in which some parts of the program
are kept on a central server and some on individual computers _
signals a radical shift in the industry, Conway said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the architecture gets reshuffled, it's the single
greatest transition an industry can go through,'' he said. He said
the change is analogous to the shift in 1990 to the client-server
era from making enterprise software for mainframe computers, a
transition he said caused fits for the market leaders of the day,
Dun &AMP; Bradstreet and MSA.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts say the present-day transformation is causing
consolidation among the smaller players in the industry and some
business failures. Baan, one of the top five enterprise software
competitors over the last several years, in May announced it had
sold its operations to Invensys, following seven straight quarters
of losses.
</P>
<P>
   However, Oracle announced its Internet-based product, 11i, last
year, deployed it piecemeal, but still racked up more than $400
million in sales the company's fiscal fourth quarter 2000. It began
shipping the software in complete form in May. Its head start gave
it ``a big marketing lead,'' said Nicole S. Gemmer, a research
associate with Chase H&AMP;Q.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, SAP introduced its product, mySAP.com, in the spring
of 1999 and began shipping in November. People familiar with the
company say the new product has 300 customers, including a deal
announced on June 14 to license mySAP.com to Nestle for use by
230,000 employees, a contract said to be worth $200 million.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   PeopleSoft plans to start shipping its product, PeopleSoft 8, in
September. Jenni Lehman, an analyst of human resources software
with the Gartner Group, said PeopleSoft's late entrance can cut
both ways. ``There's no question they did get there late,'' she
said, but she added that they have the advantage of learning from
the efforts, and failings, of SAP and Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, PeopleSoft executives say they have one key edge: that
their product is the most completely Internet-based. Indeed,
Berquist, from Goldman Sachs, said some portions of the SAP and
Oracle programs still reside on the desktop computers of employees,
meaning PeopleSoft's offering could find a receptive audience among
companies looking for a truly Internet-only solution.
</P>
<P>
   PeopleSoft's gamble was expensive. The company spend 27 percent
of its budget last year on research and development, Conway said.
But he said he was willing to bet that if PeopleSoft successfully
shifted its products to being Internet-based, it could return to
its glory days.
</P>
<P>
   Berquist said the answer will soon become clear _ perhaps not by
Tuesday, but before too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``The street is looking for evidence that with the release of
pure Internet applications, growth will be stimulated'' in the
enterprise section, he said. ``It may take a quarter or two to
know. We'll all be watching closely.''

XM SATELLITE RADIO COMPLETES ITS FINANCING 
</HEADLINE>
   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a sign that long-promised satellite radio broadcasting is
coming closer to fruition, XM Satellite Radio is expected to
announce Monday that it has completed its planned financing,
raising the last $235 million from a group of investors, people
close to the transaction said.
</P>
<P>
   This latest investment includes $50 million from Honda Motor
Co.'s sales and marketing subsidiary in the United States, $20
million from DirecTV, a provider of satellite-delivered television
service, and money from several private investment firms. The
investors received convertible preferred stock in XM, which is
based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction brings XM one step closer to its plan to
introduce satellite-delivered radio by the middle of next year. The
company would compete with Sirius Satellite Radio, which also plans
to provide nationwide satellite radio broadcasts. Each company
would charge approximately $10 a month for as many as 100 different
audio channels.
</P>
<P>
   So far, XM has raised a total of $1.26 billion with the private
placement on Friday of this latest round of stock. Most of the
company's capital will be used to launch the satellites it needs to
start service. The company also plans to officially open its
headquarters Monday in Washington, where much of the radio
programming will be produced.
</P>
<P>
   Much in the same manner that cable and satellite television have
changed the way television programming is delivered, proponents of
satellite radio are hoping that a broader array of listening
options and improved broadcast quality will appeal to consumers.
People whose cars would be equipped with small satellite receivers
are intended to be a prime audience.
</P>
<P>
   XM's backers include General Motors, with which it has an
installation agreement, and the company is discussing a similar
agreement with Honda, people close to the talks said. Sirius, which
is based in New York, has installation deals with DaimlerChrysler,
Ford Motor Co. and BMW.
</P>
<P>
   XM and Sirius have been awarded the only licenses that the
Federal Communications Commission has granted so far for satellite
radio service. Sirius successfully launched its first of three
satellites last week at a site in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   XM is planning to launch a satellite, the first of two it plans
to send into space, from a mobile launching vessel in the Pacific
Ocean later this year.

 &HT;    Threatened by the Internet, comic books now are turning to it as
possible salvation
 &HT;    By Don Fernandez
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After crushing every cosmic threat that came their
way, comic book heroes such as the Fantastic Four and Spider-Man
are now fighting for their own future _ and it may be downloadable.
</P>
<P>
   Costumed crime fighters, who have thrived for years in comic
books, need a hero themselves. Comic book sales have steadily
declined as computer games and the Internet draw potential readers
away.
</P>
<P>
   Some comic publishers hope that same technology can rescue them.
Artists are turning from pencils to pixels as their companies
explore online comics, Internet animation and other computer-based
graphic technologies to reach new readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think in time digital comics will probably eclipse their
printed forebears,'' said Scott McCloud, author of ``Understanding
Comics'' and one of the industry's top analysts. ``The function of
print is going to shift. You're going to find electronic
distribution is the best way to communicate. This year, you're
going to see amazing growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Comic books emerged as a major form of escapism during World War
II. Colorful tales of superhuman patriotism, romance, humor and
adventure captured millions of readers monthly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not uncommon for a comic to hit a million'' in sales,
said John Miller, managing editor of Comics Buyer's Guide, the
industry newspaper. ``Comics were the nation's baby sitter. It was
cheap to pay 10 cents and keep Junior busy. It was the peak of the
comic book as an icon of American culture.''
</P>
<P>
   But after the war came television, and comic book circulation
began dropping. The books had all but disappeared from newsstands
by the 1970s. Specialty comic shops arose, often with an atmosphere
unfriendly to potential new readers. And the average book, once
just a dime, now sells for $2.50 to $2.99 _ or more.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a comic title is considered impressive if it sells
250,000 copies a month. In 1999, the industry's total take was $275
million.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers hope the Internet will make their tales more
affordable and accessible. The early efforts range from still
images to drawings with limited movement. Some offerings more
resemble cartoons than comics, with lots of motion, sound effects,
voices and music.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to see some major changes over the next 10 years.
We all have to look at technology improvements,'' said Cliff
Biggers, publisher of Marietta, Ga.-based Comic Shop News, the
country's largest comics trade publication. ``This is a big debate
going on in the industry, and it's too early to see how it's going
to shake out.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvel Comics, one of the two industry leaders, is going beyond
comics to capitalize on its many characters. Movie deals (such as
``The X-Men,'' opening Friday) and merchandising draw cash that
dwarfs the profits of the most successful 22-page comic book.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get back to basics and tell our comic stories
online,'' said Bill Jemas, president of publishing and new media at
Marvel Enterprises in New York. ``It's a wonderful opportunity to
reach a whole new generation with comic books.''
</P>
<P>
   Click to the Omnitheatre section of www.marvel.com and you'll
find CyberComics: original stories of Marvel heroes using limited
animation and sound effects that complement the comic book titles.
Marvel.com soon will introduce ``Spider-Cam,'' a series of online
comics that use photographs instead of artwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in our heart a company that has to do a lot of things
at the same time to be successful,'' Jemas said. ``Comic writing
and storytelling is a great way to be inventive and take great
risks. But to reach a lot of consumers, big media is a must.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Stan Lee _ the writer-editor who launched Spider-Man, the
Hulk and other popular Marvel superheroes in the 1960s _ has jumped
to the web. His StanLee.net site offers original comic characters.
``The 7th Portal,'' about computer beta-testers who become
superheroes, and another series, ``Accuser,'' make major use of
animation and music, with voices instead of printed dialog
balloons.
</P>
<P>
   Just 1 1/2 years after debuting, the material on stanlee.net has
already spawned merchandise, movie deals and plans for theme park
rides.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (Lee) published his books at Marvel, it worked because it
was the most cost-effective medium to reach the biggest audience
with a superhero story,'' said stanlee.net co-founder Peter Paul.
``Now the biggest medium is the Internet. It makes no sense to go
back to an anachronistic technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 77, is invigorated by the response to his Internet venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so instantaneous,'' Lee said. ``In comic books, it takes
so long to print it. It takes time to get reaction and know how
much it sold. On the Internet, one second later you can get
comments.The Internet is going to be the most powerful force for
information and entertainment that the world has ever known.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if this is the evolution of comics books,'' he
said. ``I think it's just another way to tell bigger-than-life,
high-concept stories. Everybody's going to want to get into it.
Eventually, you have to get into it.''
</P>
<P>
   But DC Comics _ the industry's top-selling publisher _ isn't
putting Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman online yet. ``To my
knowledge we have nothing in development right now,'' said Patty
Jeras, spokeswoman for DC Comics in New York. ``Marvel is being
much more aggressive on this front than we are.'' DC is owned by
Time Warner, and other branches of that conglomerate are exploring
online comics, often with DC's characters.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros.' entertaindom.com offers ``The Multipath Adventures
of Superman,'' a series of 30 original cartoon shorts featuring
Superman, some written by comic book authors.
</P>
<P>
   Other comics material is available at www.warnerbros.com,
including a series based on ``The Matrix.'' Female characters from
the Batman titles will get their own online series, ``Gotham
Girls,'' later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Small companies and independent creators are also exploring
Internet options.
</P>
<P>
   Dark Horse Comics, which publishes tales based on such TV shows
as ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ``Xena: Warrior Princess,'' has
versions of these on www.darkhorse.com. One series, ``The Haunted
Man,'' is created exclusively for online, using limited animation.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Eliopoulos was hunting for a way to expose his offbeat
series ``Desperate Times'' and keep production costs down. Soon
he'll be a comic pioneer of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   In a few months, ``Desperate Times'' will be the first comic to
be offered through the Internet as an eBook. Using free technology
from software company JamBooks, readers will be able to download
and read his series on a computer, Palm Pilot or similar device.
</P>
<P>
   The cost: only $1 an issue, compared with $3 on a comic store
shelf. A $15 trade paperback featuring previously printed material
will cost $4 as a download.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be a good test market,'' Eliopoulos said. ``I've
got a fan base; people have read the book. But ... a lot of people
were afraid to spend $3 on a book they didn't know if they would
like, which killed a lot of potential buyers. Hopefully
(downloadable comics) won't scare people off so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Artist Phil Jimenez, who writes and draws ``Wonder Woman,'' and
has drawn both Marvel's X-Men and DC's Justice League of America,
is negotiating another superhero project that would debut online.
Comics, he said, will likely evolve into another art form
altogether as the concepts and characters converge with technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think simply it's a natural evolution,'' Jimenez said. ``A
large amount of material will be available online, and some of it
exclusively. I would be creating characters and environments that
would be turned into three-dimensional images by computer people.''
</P>
<P>
   Writer/artist Brian Michael Bendis has been hired by Marvel to
write two new comic book versions of ``Spider-Man'' and ``The
Fantastic Four.'' But for his independently owned crime series,
``Jinx,'' he's creating an animated version to premiere on the
Internet next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do see room for both,'' he said. ``But I still see the value
of printing the work.''
</P>
<P>
   McCloud`s just-published ``Reinventing Comics'' expounds on the
need for creators to embrace technology so the art form can evolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have great hope for the Web as a means for artists and
readers to connect and as a way for the medium of comics to grow
into some exciting new shapes,'' McCloud said. ``Technology has an
enormous role to play in comics growth in the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   But can a computer image compete with a book that can be held
and thumbed through? Will collectors, who have hundreds of comics
sealed in plastic bags and stored in boxes, be drawn to building an
electronic library?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a strong fetish factor,'' Comic Buyer's Guide's John
Miller said. ``Whereas the recording industry has had to worry
about people copying exact duplicates of its songs, comics haven't.
People really still want to have the physical item.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds writer-artist Bendis: ``You can't replace the feeling of
reading a comic. You can read nearly every magazine for free online
but people still buy them. People like touching paper.''

POPE SAYS GAY PRIDE FESTIVAL IN ROME INSULTED CHURCH'S JUBILEE
YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Pope John Paul II expressed ``bitterness'' Sunday about a
gay pride festival in Rome during this Roman Catholic Holy Year,
saying that the event, which ends Monday, was an affront to the
church and the ``Christian values'' of the Italian capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the name of the Church of Rome, I cannot not express the
bitterness for the affront to the Grand Jubilee of the year 2000
and for the offense to the Christian values of a city that is so
dear to the hearts of Catholics across the world,'' the pope said
in a message delivered from a balcony over St. Peter's Square.
</P>
<P>
   For months, church officials lobbied to cancel the festival, but
Sunday was the first time the pope personally addressed the issue.
The fact that he did so even after the most contested part of the
program, Saturday's gay pride parade, was a sign of how strongly
this pope feels about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   So was the fact that he spoke out right after celebrating a
special Jubilee Mass for inmates at a Rome prison, effectively
eclipsing the appeal he made there for governments to reduce
sentences for prisoners during the Holy Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church cannot silence the truth,'' the pope said in his
message. ``because it would not live up to its faith in God the
creator and would not help discern what is good from what is
evil.''
</P>
<P>
   He then reminded his audience of church teaching on
homosexuality, saying that ``homosexual acts go against natural
law.'' Citing the Catholic catechism, John Paul said, ``This
inclination, objectively disordered, is for most of them a trial.''
The pope added that gays should be accepted with ``respect,
compassion, and sensitivity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be
avoided,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's remarks instantly caused anger and indignation at
Capocotta, a nude beach near Rome, where the gay pride event, World
Pride, was holding a final beach party after a week of conferences,
fashion shows and concerts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope is wrong to condemn World Pride,'' said Franco
Grillini, the honorary president of Arcigay, an Italian gay rights
organization. ``The real offense is homophobia and antigay
prejudice fueled by the Vatican hierarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican's lobbying against the festival led to a fierce
political battle between Italy's governing center-left coalition
and the center-right opposition, which joined the Vatican in
opposing the timing and aims of the World Pride festival.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the pope's appeal to governments throughout the world
to reduce prison sentences and improve conditions as a symbol of
mercy during the Holy Year had strong political repercussions in
Italy. The Italian government is considering a general pardon or
amnesty to ease conditions in Italy's badly crowded prisons. But
the center-right contends that a pardon could put dangerous
criminals back on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's appeal has raised expectations in prisons, where
inmates _ and prison guards _ all over Italy have held protests,
hunger strikes and disturbances. And it has put pressure on
politicians, who have to weigh the pope's moral authority and
popularity against public opinion polls, which suggest that most
Italians oppose a general pardon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of you lives for the day in which, your sentence served,
you can regain your liberty,'' the pope told 74 prisoners seated
near him Sunday in the rotunda of Regina Coeli, or Queen of Heaven,
a prison for men on the Tiber River. Hundreds of other prisoners
sat in corridors off the room, listening. ``I have invoked for you
a sign of clemency.''

 &HT;    Research team concludes baseballs are no different
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Everybody's got a theory, but none is more hands-on
than Aaron Boutwell's.
</P>
<P>
   Boutwell works for Rawlings, and this week the marketing manager
is spending his days hand-stitching baseballs for rapt audiences at
the John Hancock All-Star FanFest at the Georgia World Congress
Center.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to know why so many baseballs are flying out of
parks this year, Boutwell starts his argument with a bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baseballs aren't juiced,'' he says, picking up a 31-ounce
wooden Adirondack with one hand, pointing at it with the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``See this handle? Players today wouldn't play with the bats
that old-timers like Babe Ruth used, which had thick handles. This
handle is skinny. It makes the bat lighter and more whippy. Players
can swing it faster and hit the ball farther.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one reason there are so many home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Boutwell then runs through a litany of other reasons: bigger
hitters, smaller parks, worse pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball,'' he says, with the gravity of words chiseled in
granite, ``is exactly the same ball as they've been using for
decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't know that from the fan chatter and sports-bar
speculation that have been juicing the juiced-ball debate since
they lowered the pitching mound in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   With baseballs leaving stadiums at a record pace _ through June
29, there have been an average of 2.56 home runs per game, compared
to 2.28 a game during the same period of the 1999 season _ Major
League Baseball commissioned a study to settle the issue.
</P>
<P>
   EXHAUSTIVE TESTING
</P>
<P>
   The answer is no, according to researchers at the Baseball
Research Center at UMass-Lowell, who spent months batting balls
with a $350,000 machine known as a BAUM, then sorting through the
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The players may be pumped, and the stadiums may be smaller, but,
by golly, it ain't the baseballs.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, researchers report, this season's supply of baseballs,
on average, travel 1.4 feet less than last year's baseballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the margin of statistical error is one and a half
feet,'' says Lawrence Fallon, a co-author of the report, ``that
means there's no difference, or the difference is negligible.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who are mechanical engineers, studied the
dimensions and make-up of the balls as well.
</P>
<P>
   Measurements were made of the seam height and cover frictions to
determine how that could affect the pitcher's control and ball
movement.
</P>
<P>
   The seams on this year's ball are approximately the same height
as the seams on last year's ball, according to the researchers, and
the cover friction is about the same.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers couldn't measure the effect of a ball's spin on
how far it's hit, however, since the BAUM machine throws a
knuckleball.
</P>
<P>
   In the test of 192 balls from the 1999 and 2000 season, the
machine pitched the ball 70 mph, and the machine's bat hit the
balls with a swing speed of 70 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers: On average, a 1999 ball hit by the BAUM traveled an
estimated 400 feet; the average 2000 ball traveled an estimated
398.6 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The testers didn't actually measure the distance the balls
traveled because the research was done indoors at the research
facility. The distance was computed, based on the speed of the
balls as they came off the bat.
</P>
<P>
   The engineers and baseball officials also sought to debunk
theories that it's something about the ball's cork center or
cowhide cover that's different.
</P>
<P>
   They visited the plants that manufacture the balls' components:
a ball-stitching facility in Costa Rica; the factory that produces
ball yarn in Ludlow, Vt.; the ``pill plant'' _ where the cork core
is coated with red rubber _ in Batesville, Miss., and the plant
where the rawhide covers are made in Tullahoma, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Short answer: The components of the ball and manufacturing
process are the same this year as last.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers even researched the researchers at Rawlings' Ava,
Mo. ball-testing site, where baseballs are fired out of a cannon at
60 miles per hour into a wall of northern white ash, the wood
major-league bats are made of.
</P>
<P>
   They measured whether the Coefficient of Restitution (COR) is in
keeping with major-league rules. The COR number measures how much
the ball bounces back.
</P>
<P>
   The number, 57, which means it bounces back 57 percent as fast
as the speed it hit the wall, is roughly the same this year as
last, and roughly the same as it has always been.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's within the acceptable range demanded by the rules,'' said
Fallon.
</P>
<P>
   The study, of course, will hardly settle the juiced-ball debate
any more than the Warren Commission got people to quit theorizing
that it was a gunman on the grassy knoll who shot President
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   And, no thanks to the researchers, either. Already they're
testing more balls, from the '60s, '70s, '80s, and earlier '90s, to
see how they compare to this year's model.
</P>
<P>
   And not just any old ball will do. They have to have been kept
in an ``environmentally controlled packaging,'' says Tim Mustone ,
another one of the researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting calls from all kinds of people trying to give us
old balls,'' says Mustone. ``But any old ball won't do, even if it
was autographed by Ted Williams.''

RIGHTS GROUPS ALARMED BY ARREST OF EGYPTIAN SCHOLAR
</HEADLINE>
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ The recent arrest of a prominent sociologist on
suspicion of ``defaming'' Egypt has alarmed human rights advocates
around the region who say it reflects a policy among Arab leaders
toward political criticism that can best be described as killing
the messenger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has convinced the people that Egypt and the
government are one and the same thing,'' said Gasser Abdel Razik,
secretary general of a legal aid center in Cairo. ``If someone
criticizes the government, then it is an insult against Egypt. If
any crisis erupts, they do not solve it but they punish the one who
reported it.''
</P>
<P>
   The sociologist, Saad Eddin Ibrahim, who has been held in an
Egyptian prison since June 30, has taught at the American
University in Cairo for 25 years. He founded the Ibn Khaldoun
Center for Developmental Studies, a private group in Cairo that
includes two government ministers on its board and conducts
research on democracy, civil society and minority rights.
</P>
<P>
   He recently wrote an article that appeared in a Saudi magazine,
Al Majala, and satirized the efforts by some Arab leaders to groom
their sons for succession. Among others, Ibrahim mentioned
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. He also has written frequently on
the status of the Christian minority in Egypt, where the subject of
religious tensions is taboo.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim has been held since security agents began interrogating
him on June 30 about a documentary his center produced to instruct
Egyptians about their voting rights and encourage them to take part
in parliamentary election scheduled for November.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Saada, who is one of Ibrahim's lawyers, said investigators
had accused him of defaming Egypt because the film refers to
complaints about fraud filed after past elections.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim has not been charged with a crime but is being held for
15 days for questioning. Under Egyptian law, detention without
charge can be extended up to 45 days.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the U.S. Embassy in Cairo who visited Ibrahim this
week said he had reassured them that he was not being mistreated.
The American ambassador, Daniel Kurzer, has expressed concern about
the arrest to Egypt's prime minister, according to an embassy
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that his detention is not inspired by a desire to
silence a voice advocating freedom of expression and democracy,''
said the spokesman, who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim, a former adviser to the Egyptian government who holds
dual Egyptian and American citizenship, earned a Ph.D. from the
University of Washington and has written or edited 30 books in
English and Arabic. He has been a frequent guest at international
conferences on Arab political life.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim's arrest has worried human rights groups and advocates
around the Arab Middle East, where nongovernmental organizations
and journalists who criticize their governments are routinely
harassed or imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saad Eddin Ibrahim's arrest reminds us that one of the leading
sources of instability and political-economic distortion in the
Arab world is the unchecked use of state power, combined with the
state's whimsical ability to use the rule of law for its own
political ends,'' wrote Rami G. Khouri, a political analyst, in The
Jordan Times last week.
</P>
<P>
   Despite apparent progress in a handful of countries that declare
themselves to be democracies, like Egypt and Jordan, independent
organizations have found themselves fighting for their lives, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt, like its neighbors, tightly regulates nongovernmental
organizations and the press. Labor unions can be formed and hold
internal elections only with government approval. The government
licenses political parties _ and has approved only one new party in
the past 22 years. A handful of others operate, but most were
allowed only after appealing to the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Egypt enacted a law requiring all nongovernmental
organizations to register, report any foreign financing and submit
the names of their trustees for approval to the government. The law
was seen as an attempt to control groups that might serve as fronts
for Islamic militants, but it was widely criticized by human rights
and legal aid groups. It was declared unconstitutional, on
technical grounds, by the Constitutional Court last month.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt has more than a dozen groups that investigate human rights
abuses and many newspapers that publish reports on torture, illegal
detention, prison conditions and other topics. They have fax
machines, speak openly to foreign journalists and post reports on
their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   But when the subject turns to a few particularly sensitive
topics _ among them election fraud, official corruption and
religious tension _ the government has cracked down, often using a
provision in the penal code that makes it a crime to defame Egypt's
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Five journalists at the daily newspaper Al Ahrar, for example,
were recently sentenced to jail terms because they published a
Government Accounting Office report on mismanagement at the
government airline, Egypt Air. Officials of the Egyptian
Organization for Human Rights were jailed last year, accused of
defaming the country and illegally accepting foreign funds, after
publishing a report on the police handling of a clash between
Christians and Muslims in Upper Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government wants to finish off all civil society
organizations in Egypt,'' said Hafez Abu Saada, the secretary
general of the group, who was himself jailed for several weeks last
year after his group published the report on police brutality.
``Either we agree with them all the time or we are the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   In Jordan, it is still a crime to insult the dignity of the king
and, as in Egypt or other Arab countries, courts can shut down a
publication or jail people who are found to have harmed the
``public interest'' or criticized members of the government.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials in Egypt said Ibrahim was the subject of a
lengthy police investigation before he was arrested. Hisham Saraya,
the chief prosecutor of the state security agency, said Ibrahim was
suspected of illegally taking money from a foreign entity, using
that money fraudulently and forging election ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim's lawyers said the election ballots were printed for use
in the documentary. They said he received money from the European
Commission, the executive body of the European Union, to make the
film.
</P>
<P>
   Saraya, the government prosecutor, said protests from diplomats
and other human rights advocates would have no effect on the police
inquiry against Ibrahim. ``No other authority _ nothing but truth
and justice _ can influence our prosecution,'' he said.

   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ The increasing likelihood that a 73-year-old
former prime minister will go to prison for remarks in a political
speech six years ago is sending a chill through Turkey's political
elite and bringing widespread calls to relax laws that restrict
freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, an appeals court upheld the one-year sentence and
lifetime political ban imposed on former Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan on the charge of ``provoking hatred'' in a 1994 speech.
Since the ruling, political leaders have scrambled to diminish the
decision's impact on Turkey's efforts to portray itself as a modern
democracy and to join the European Union. Even Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit said he was saddened at the prospect of Erbakan going
to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the concerns translate into a genuine overhaul of laws
regarded outside Turkey as violations of free expression is
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders across the political spectrum indicated that it may be
time to modify elements of the code that make it a crime to promote
religious or ethnic differences and to criticize the government or
military.
</P>
<P>
   Elements in the influential military and the politicians most
strongly wedded to Turkey's secularist state still oppose change,
however, for fear Turkey will turn more toward Islam.
</P>
<P>
   A leader of the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party told Ecevit on
Thursday that the organization would consider supporting changes to
the criminal code in exchange for leniency for Erbakan, according
to the Turkish press. Backing for revisions also came from parties
that form Ecevit's coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make radical improvements to the civil and criminal
codes,'' Bulent Akarcali, a member of Parliament who is deputy
chairman of the Motherland Party, one of the coalition members,
said in an interview. ``It is a must.''
</P>
<P>
   Gunduz Aktan, a former senior Turkish diplomat, said laws
categorized in the criminal code as ``crimes against the state''
need to be revised to recognize the difference between legitimate
political speech or criticism of the government and threats. ``We
need to separate violence and threats to public order from
legitimate free speech,'' Aktan, a former ambassador to Greece and
Japan, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Erbakan was prime minister for a year in 1996 and 1997. He
resigned under pressure from the military and political opponents
who charged he was plotting against the secular order of Turkey.
His pro-Islamic party was outlawed, but later re-emerged as the
Virtue Party, with most of the same leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Erbakan was convicted of a crime against the state
for a speech he made in a Kurdish-dominated area before he became
prime minister. In the speech, he contended that Turkey had
abandoned its Islamic roots and that secular politicians had
divided the Kurds from other Turks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this country there are two parties: the righteous and the
fallacious,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Erbakan's jail sentence and ban were upheld by the appeals
court, and he is expected to serve about five months in prison
unless the chief prosecutor's office recommends reducing the
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The uproar over the court ruling stems in part from fears that
it threatens Turkey's prospects for European Union membership.
Guenther Verheugen, the European Union's commissioner for
enlargement, is scheduled to visit Ankara this week and Western
diplomats have already expressed concern over imprisoning an aging
former leader.
</P>
<P>
   Seyfi Tashan, director of the Foreign Policy Institute in
Ankara, noted that the threats that validated the restrictions on
speech for many Turks appear to have eased. Kurdish separatism is
less threatening and concern over Islamic fundamentalism may also
be diminishing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether the perception of threats has
decreased to the point where free expression can be condoned,''
Tashan said.
</P>
<P>
   But others argue that the Islamic threat is still too potent to
warrant easing restrictions. ``There is no such thing as mild
Islam,'' said Suna Kili, an author and political science professor
at Bosporus University. ``The republic has the right to protect
itself. Even in France and Germany there are laws protecting the
secular state.''
</P>
<P>
   The strictness of the laws was demonstrated on Friday when a
prosecutor increased charges against Nadire Mater, a Turkish
journalist who wrote a book last year recounting stories of
soldiers who fought the Kurds in southeast Turkey. Rejecting an
independent report that Mater did not violate criminal statutes,
the prosecutor said the author would face two to 12 years in prison
if convicted of insulting the military.
</P>
<P>
   Mater, who was honored last week by Human Rights Watch, said
after the hearing: ``I'm not very optimistic about changes in
Turkey today.''

<P>
   OWENSBORO, Ky. _ The county jailers of Kentucky are eagerly
preparing to levy room, board and medical charges on inmates under
a pay-your-way practice that dates to medieval England but is
finding fresh life in America, the global leader in incarceration.
</P>
<P>
   The chief jailer in Daviess County, Harold N. Taylor, is
awaiting his new hotelier's powers with a touch of nostalgia for
his salad days as a deputy sheriff in the '60s. Back then, he
recalls, respectful town drunkards barely taxed the public budget
as they gratefully slugged down black coffee and slept off their
misdeeds in a far less complex world of the jail house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, you have the situation where one inmate went to
court to sue me to get all his teeth replaced,'' said Taylor,
echoing the complaints of county jailers across the country that
rising medical and housing costs in small-town jails necessitate
turning to the inmates to help foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Under a new law that takes effect this month, the state's 85
jails will have the power to charge up to $50 a day for room and
board, plus a $20 paperwork fee and other special charges for
unruly inmates who sling their food about or damage bunks or
plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more jails across the country are turning to these
fees,'' said Stephen Ingley, executive director of the American
Jail Association, which has 5,000 members. Each year the nation's
jails have 20 million admissions and exits, with more than 600,000
inmates in residence each day, including many felony defendants
awaiting trial. Handling this torrent is no longer a sleepy-time
industry, Ingley said, and inmates are covered by federal and state
standards for housing, diet and medical care that have grown
stronger and more expensive in modern times.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who lobbied for the new law as chief of the Kentucky
Jailers Association, said: ``There's the old saying, `Crime doesn't
pay.' Well now there's the thought that maybe the criminals should
start paying.''
</P>
<P>
   Local jailers say that jails in Florida, Iowa, Michigan, West
Virginia and elsewhere saw improvements in budgets and inmate
behavior when they began levying fees in recent years. To
complaints from civil libertarians that the levy amounts to a
double-dipping of punishment, jailers reply that judges have long
had the power to levy court costs on defendants and there was no
attendant controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a law without compassion,'' said state Sen. David
E. Boswell, D-Owensboro, who was the chief sponsor of the measure.
``It has to be shown an inmate can afford to pay, and a jailer has
up to a year to collect once an inmate becomes a productive citizen
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The law sailed through the Legislature with barely a dissent. It
covers only county inmates typically sentenced to a year or less in
jail, not state and federal felons who serve longer terms in
prisons. Proponents contend that it can provide an extra measure of
deterrence when the public sees, for example, a drunken driver
doing his jail time but also tapping his own resources for good
measure. Proponents also cite the potential for compensation in
coping with modern criminal life in which well-capitalized drug
dealers routinely cycle through local jails.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of dealers come through here after arrest with $2,000 or
$5,000 in their pockets,'' Taylor said, putting such inmates at the
top of his most lucrative lodger list.
</P>
<P>
   Jailers will have the power to take money from inmates'
commissary accounts and even pursue them through collection
agencies if jailers decide it is worth the trouble. They concede
that the levy has practical limits for the many jail house
deadbeats serving time, but Taylor hopes to net $250,000 a year for
his $3 million budget, and proponents promise millions more for the
state's other 119 counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know you can't get blood out of a turnip,'' said Dan
Fackler, the jailer for Bullitt County, sympathizing with some down
on his luck inmate suddenly shocked with a lodging bill at
checkout. ``But we hear they're getting maybe 30 cents on each
dollar due with this in other parts of the country, and taxpayers
think it's a step in the right direction: You should pay for what
you do in this life, whether it's good or bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Jail house costs vary, but the federal government estimates the
average room and board costs $34 per day, with medical costs
additional. Jailers say that, more than any other factor, the
rising expense of mandated medical care is spurring the current
move to levy fees on inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're becoming more like a hospital and a care center,''
Fackler said. ``That's OK _ it could be my brother in there with a
need _ but nowadays his medicine can cost $300.'' And under the
current state mandate of three jail beds for every 1,000 citizens,
Fackler said he must find extra resources to help build an $8
million, 300-bed jail for his fast-growing county south of
Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what got people tore up around here,'' Fackler added.
``So if, say, McAdoo owes me $495 when he's checking out and he
only has $180, well I'll just take the $180 and say thank you,
McAdoo.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, Kentucky jailers will have the option to charge
their inmates or not, to negotiate a compromise payment, and even
to carry negative balances on the books for the next time a repeat
offender might return flush with cash.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor intends to charge $20 a day for room and board plus
medical costs and a $20 admission fee. ``In the old days, you'd
find someone curled up on the sidewalk with his bottle of
Thunderbird; you'd take him in,'' he recalled. A regular miscreant
might not even be written up back then, and there was a mutual
kindness of jailer and inmate that, Taylor insisted, was as
commonplace as the jail's old baloney sanndwich. ``Now we've got a
minimum of two hot meals a day and each inmate has his required
square footage,'' said the jailer, busily preparing a detailed
computer program to retally a modern inmates' debt to society.

ON EVE OF SUMMIT MEETING, RIGHT-WING PARTIES LEAVE BARAK'S
GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak's government disintegrated
Sunday, as one right-leaning party after another quit in protest of
anticipated concessions to the Palestinians, leaving him on
unsteady ground on the eve of his departure to the Camp David
summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring Barak's pleas for unity, three parties, including the
ultra-Orthodox Shas, defected to the previously weak opposition,
upsetting the political balance of power in a single afternoon.
Barak lost his parliamentary majority, and his broad coalition,
which was constructed precisely to build a stable foundation of
support for difficult peace moves, shriveled into a weak
center-left government.
</P>
<P>
   In an address to the nation, Barak defiantly said that the
collapse of his coalition would not affect his trip to Maryland,
which he said was backed by a mandate from the Israelis who elected
him by an overwhelming majority on a peacemaking platform. Barak
asserted that, as a lifelong soldier and fledgling politician, he
had a direct bond with the voters that existed in a kind of
extrapolitical space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Citizens of Israel, approximately one year ago I was elected
by you to be the prime minister of Israel in order to lead the
state of Israel to a safer reality and in order to create a better
future for our children,'' Barak said. ``I did not receive my
mandate from the politicians or from the parties. I received my
mandate from each one of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that by adding new small parties to his government
and relying on the support of Arab parties, Barak could still win a
parliamentary majority for any deal that might be reached at the
summit meeting. But it would not be the ``Jewish majority'' that he
originally sought in hopes of moving toward peace without deepening
divisions that could destabilize not just his government but also
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Barak repeated that he would rely on a popular vote, in the form
of a referendum on an agreement, to try and salve those rifts. And
his office predicted Sunday night that any agreement he achieved at
Camp David would be ratified by a significant popular majority.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine that the new Israeli political reality
will not alter the dynamic of the three-way, retreat-style summit
meeting, where the goal will be to end a 52-year conflict and
resolve the most divisive issues between the Israelis and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But precisely how is uncertain. Palestinian negotiators could
now perceive Barak as a weakened leader unable to deliver on his
promises. While Barak could face a strengthened opposition, he may
also feel free to make concessions without worrying which political
partner he might lose.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Palestinian officials said Sunday night that they
would try and shut out the Israeli political convolutions and,
although they were skeptical even before Sunday's events, focus on
trying to achieve an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Some Palestinian officials also said that they were suspicious
that Barak was engineering his own political difficulties so that
he could hide behind them at the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the first time that we have witnessed such a show on
the stage of Ehud Barak,'' said Abdul Ahmed Rahman, the secretary
general of the Palestinian Cabinet. ``This is not credible. If
Barak thinks that he can manufacture the impression that he is
restricted, well, such maneuvers will be transparent to the
Americans as well as to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Kicking off the snowballing dynamic of the day, Foreign Minister
David Levy told Barak Sunday morning that, in protest at what he
labeled the Palestinians' hard-line positions and threats of
violence, he would not join the delegation traveling to Camp David.
He did not speak publicly about his decision, but associates said
that he was pessimistic that anything would come of the high-level
talks, which are supposed to start on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Yaron Dekel said he saw this as ``a slap in
the face'' to Barak and a no-confidence vote in Barak's policy.
</P>
<P>
   Then Interior Minister Natan Sharansky, leader of a small
Russian immigrant party, resigned, saying that Barak had
obstinately refused to divulge his positions in advance and to
build the internal support needed for what could be difficult
concessions ahead. Sharansky had been pushing Barak to form a unity
government with the rightist Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are arriving at the summit in the United States weakened,
without red lines, without the support of the government and
without the support of most of the people,'' Sharansky wrote in his
resignation letter to Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under these conditions,'' he continued, ``the agreement that
you will be able to reach is dangerous from a diplomatic point of
view and has the potential to cause a split in the people, a split
from which, God forbid, there will be no turning back.''
</P>
<P>
   Several hours later, the Shas party, whose balkiness has
unsettled the government since it took office last July, finally
walked out for good.
</P>
<P>
   Shas is a religious party that doubles as an ethnic pride
movement for working class Jews of Middle Eastern origin. In its
routine threats to quit, it was perceived to be maneuvering for its
party's interests, particularly the financial health and
independence of its religious school system. If Shas was satisfied,
the common wisdom said, Shas would support peacemaking based on its
spiritual leader's religious ruling that territory could be
conceded if lives would be saved as a result.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts repeatedly predicted that Shas, whose constituency
leans to the right, would get the jitters when a crucial moment
arrived. Indeed, by day's end, when it became clear that it would
be the only right-leaning party left in the government, Shas made
the decision to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shas entered the coalition because the peace process is very
important to us and we would have expected to have been genuine
partners,'' said Eli Yishai, Shas' political leader. ``But to be
partners on the road taken one needs to know the road. And we
don't. We don't know Barak's red lines. The red lines that he
demarcated and presented to the people are obscure and unclear.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's office, in a statement, countered that his red lines _
which the Palestinians regularly and glumly cite as evidence that
an agreement will be difficult to achieve _ have been well-known
since his campaign. The statement said that revealing them in
greater detail would weaken Israel's negotiating position.
</P>
<P>
   The statement reiterated Barak's absolutes: no return to 1967
borders, ``a united Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty, no foreign
army west of the Jordan River, a majority of the Jewish settlers
will remain in settlement blocs and no Israeli recognition of legal
or moral responsibility for creating the refugee problem.''
</P>
<P>

   Officials of the leftist Meretz Party, who recently resigned
their Cabinet positions so that Shas would stay in the government,
were furious. ``All through the years we heard of the moderate
stand taken by Shas because Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, their leader, he
puts foremost the saving of lives _ that saving lives is more
important than territories,'' said Ran Cohen, the former Trade
Minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Barak comes along and with tweezers goes over every
detail, every settlement, every road, every section, measures
exactly as possible in order to save lives, to prevent returning to
the killing of Jews and Arabs in a continuation of 100 years of
war, and the Shas people, the moment they stand before the most
important diplomatic, ideological, test of principle, they say they
are about to quit? For what? Do they want to return to the
intifada?''
</P>
<P>
   The National Religious Party, which represents religious
Zionists and the settlers, also said that its central committee had
voted unanimously to pull out of the government.
</P>
<P>
   All three parties that quit were part of the rightist government
of former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which fell after
Netanyahu concluded an interim peace agreement with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Barak faces a no-confidence motion in his government on Monday,
which was submitted by the Likud party on the basis of his supposed
``capitulation'' to Arafat. Analysts predict that Barak will
survive it, but his office said Sunday night that he had changed
his travel plans to return to Israel from a trip to Egypt on Monday
so that he could be present in the parliament later in the day.
Then he will proceed to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The parties' resignations will reduce Barak to a 42-member
government in a 120-member parliament. He could bulk up to a
heftier minority government of 58 members by pulling in three other
small parties: a small, liberal Russian immigrant faction, a
secularist party and a trade unionists' party.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be an unstable political base for running the
government, and it remains to be seen how Barak will handle either
a success or failure at Camp David. Political analysts consider new
elections likely.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As a leader routinely accused of haughtiness and autocratic
behavior, Barak's bid to ignore the political system and appeal
directly to the people is a risky one. ``Had I been forced to
listen to all the prophets of doom _ the very same prophets who are
now speaking at large _ I suppose that our children would still be
in the Lebanese mud,'' he said, referring to those who predicted
that the Israeli troop withdrawal from southern Lebanon in May
would lead to war. ``No one will teach me what security is.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``I have to rise above all of the political
disputes and above all party considerations and exhaust all of the
possibilities on the way to a peace agreement that will put an end
to the bloody conflict between us and our neighbors. Put an end to
it at the negotiation table and not in the battlefields and in
terror stricken streets.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WALKERTON, Ontario _ Almost two months after North America's
deadliest outbreak of E. coli contamination hit this town, its
sentiments are captured on a road sign: ``E. coli, please go
away.''
</P>
<P>
   In this once obscure farming community near Lake Huron,
residents live in fear of the bacteria that entered their lives
through their drinking water. Lingering in a closed branch of the
municipal water system, the fatal strain, Escherichia coli O157:H7,
still infects a well that was sealed when the outbreak became
public, on May 23.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, E. coli has been identified as the killer of seven
people and is being investigated as a cause of nine more deaths. In
addition, 90 people were admitted to hospital, almost 1,000 were
treated and released, and another 1,000 called medical
professionals to complain of diarrhea or cramps. All in all, the
bacteria laid low about 40 percent of Walkerton's population of
4,800.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be the first waterborne outbreak in North
America,'' said Dr. Murray S. McQuigge, medical officer for the
region, who first raised the alarm. Since the fatal strain of E.
coli was first identified in 1982, it largely has been transmitted
through food, often poorly cooked beef.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy has thrust Walkerton _ a pastoral town about three
hours northwest of Toronto _ into the middle of a political tussle
over Canada's future. To the conservatives who hope to recapture
the national government in elections next year, Walkerton
symbolizes bureaucratic incompetence. Liberals, meanwhile, use it
to illustrate the danger of making cuts in Canada's protective
social net.
</P>
<P>
   For the left, the contamination was detected too late because
Mike Harris, premier of Ontario and Canada's most powerful
conservative in office, cut the budget of the Environment Ministry
by 42 percent after taking power in 1995. Nine hundred staff
members were fired. The ministry halved the number of annual water
utility inspections, enforcing laws increasingly by phone or fax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walkerton dramatized that a right-wing, market-based agenda of
deregulation and privatization leaves people vulnerable,'' said
Maude Barlow, chairwoman of the Council of Canadians, a liberal
group.
</P>
<P>
   For the right, Walkerton would have been spared the tragedy if
the water system had been privatized and run for profit by
efficient managers. The conservative side admits, however, that
Harris' government was sloppy when it handed water testing over to
private laboratories without requiring that the laboratories be
accredited or that they send test results to health and
environmental oversight agencies.
</P>
<P>
   After the E. coli scandal broke, a poll in mid-June showed that
the Liberal Party lead over Harris' Progressive Conservative Party
had doubled to 7 percent in two months. The day after the poll was
completed, the Harris government dropped plans to privatize
Ontario's public water systems.
</P>
<P>
   During the first four months of this year, water samples
submitted by Walkerton's public water company tested positive for
E. coli bacteria five times, according to Ontario's Environment
Ministry. But, in a violation of procedure, these test results were
not passed to the regional medical officer, McQuigge.
</P>
<P>
   They also did not cause undue concern for Stan Koebel, manager
of the water company, which forwarded them to the ministry. Koebel
joined the company 28 years ago after graduating from high school;
the job was secured by his father, then Walkerton's public works
manager.
</P>
<P>
   On May 12, a heavy rain fell when a chlorinator on one well had
been out of service for a month. Public health officials theorize
that flood waters washed manure into wells and that the manure was
contaminated with E. coli, a bacterium that is found, at any given
time, in roughly 10 percent of North American cows, sheep and deer.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times we would end up with fecal matter in the water,
and boil the water for a while, but this is the first time that
water killed people,'' said John Markauskas, a high school science
teacher. ``I don't think people realized that you can get E. coli
from water. You thought it was from uncooked food.''
</P>
<P>
   After Mother's Day, May 14, town residents and visitors started
falling ill with diarrhea. On May 15, Koebel shipped water samples
marked ``Rush, Rush, Rush'' to a private laboratory that regularly
tested the town's water. According to John Martin, an environmental
lawyer under contract with the town, the results came back the next
day showing that ``Well 7 had high levels of total coliform and E.
coli.''
</P>
<P>
   Well 7, the only town water source at the time, was not
receiving chlorine, which normally would have killed the bacteria.
As the week progressed, more and more people appeared at local
hospitals suffering from bloody diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   McQuigge said that toward the end of the week, he, two
assistants and a nursing-home director separately telephoned the
water company to ask if the water was contaminated. Each caller was
assured that the water was fine, he said. At the same time,
according to Martin, the water company started adding chlorine to
the water to kill the bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't conjecture why we were told four times that the water
was all right,'' McQuigge mused. ``We spent two days needlessly
looking around for possible food sources.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, May 21, he said, his staff started marking a town map
with a yellow dot for each case of diarrhea. ``At the end of the
day, the map of Walkerton was yellow,'' he said. ``We knew there
was only one thing that can do that _ the water supply.''
</P>
<P>
   McQuigge ordered Walkerton residents to boil their drinking
water. With Canada in the middle of a three-day holiday weekend, he
had to round up a technician to break into the taped,
continuous-loop broadcast at the local radio station. Koebel,
meanwhile, insisted in a May 23 interview in the local newspaper
that the cause of the diarrhea outbreak was still a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Later on May 23, McQuigge received results of water tests that
he had independently commissioned. After telephoning Koebel and
telling him that the town water was contaminated with E. coli,
McQuigge said the water manager ``broke down'' and ``said he knew
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the tragedy, Koebel has been in seclusion, refusing to
give interviews or to make public statements. He is the subject of
a police investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, anger is rising. Residents expect to depend on
bottled water into August, town restaurants have written off the
tourist season and local supermarkets have registered a slump in
sales. Harris rubbed many residents the wrong way when he came here
and implied that outsiders were stirring up trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seven dead already, we have children with permanent
organ damage, we face six to eight more weeks without water, we
have massive business losses,'' said Bruce Davidson, a massage
therapist who has started a pressure group, Concerned Walkerton
Citizens. ``We don't need any help in being agitated.''

NORWAY'S JAN EGELAND OBSERVES COMPLICATED COLOMBIAN CONFLICT
CLOSE-UP FOR U.N. 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Map is being sent to NYT graphic clients. Nonsubscribers

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ He organized the ``Norwegian channel,'' which
led to a peace plan between Israelis and Palestinians, and has had
a hand in peace talks from Central America to Central Africa. Now,
as a U.N. emissary in Colombia, Jan Egeland is leading efforts here
to solve a a 35-year conflict unlike any he has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is unique in Colombia compared with most other processes
is the size and scale of the armed actors and armed conflict, and
the size of the black money associated with drugs and other
criminal activities,'' Egeland said in an interview here recently.
``So the sources fueling the conflict are bigger than they have
been in many other places, and that makes it more challenging.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Egeland's title is merely that of special adviser to
the secretary-general on international assistance to Colombia. But
after just six months on the job, Egeland, 42, has emerged as a
trusted intermediary between the Colombian government and left-wing
guerrilla groups, which until recently agreed on one thing: They
did not want any foreigners in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Colombia we have always had the fear that
internationalizing the peace process would also mean
internationalizing the conflict, so we were suspicious of outsiders
wanting to enter,'' said Fernando Cepeda Ulloa, a former interior
minister. ``So Egeland's presence here is a good thing because it
means a barrier has been breached.''
</P>
<P>
   Egeland, who has been a journalist, deputy foreign minister of
Norway and a Red Cross official, is careful to play down his own
role.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no formal third-party role vis-a-vis the Colombian
conflict, nor are we seeking one,'' he said. While acknowledging
that he is in constant contact with both sides, he cautioned, ``It
may be premature to say that we are facilitating any kind of peace
process, because none of the parties have asked anyone to really
play that kind of an activist role.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Egeland has been instrumental in ``attempting to get the
guerrillas out of the jungle and into the modern world,'' said
Cynthia Arnson, editor of a new book ``Comparative Peace Processes
in Latin America'' (Woodrow Wilson Center Press, 2000). As in
Guatemala, she noted, here you had ``a guerrilla movement that was
so isolated politically and had operated so long in clandestinity
that it had lost touch with politics and public opinion and needed
to be re-acclimated.''
</P>
<P>
   While both the Palestine Liberation Organization and the
Guatemalan guerrillas were nearly bankrupt when they began peace
talks, here the two main insurgent forces are flourishing as a
result of their links with drug trafficking, kidnappings and
extortion. In addition, the biggest group, the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, has formally been given control of an area the
size of Switzerland, and now seems to want to deal with the
government on almost a state-to-state level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our situation is very odd and ambiguous, in that there is a
coexistence between the government and the guerrillas that I don't
see elsewhere,'' said Cepeda Ulloa. ``That makes Egeland's job more
difficult, in that the guerrillas think it perfectly natural to ask
the state for territory or the international community for
financing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Egeland said that in some other respects, the issues being
confronted here are not as intractable as elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is more difficult to negotiate Jerusalem than agrarian
reform in Colombia,'' he said. ``One of the positive aspects of
Colombia compared with other places is that the parties are not
necessarily so much poles apart on some of the issues as many
believe.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the Revolutionary Armed Forces and the other main
left-wing guerrilla group, the Army of National Liberation, are
engaged in separate but parallel negotiations with the government.
But ``later on,'' Egeland said, ``there should be a convergence''
of the two sets of talks because ``in the end there is only one
country and society to reform.''
</P>
<P>
   In an essay in ``Herding Cats'' (U.S. Institute of Peace Press,
Washington, 1999), a new book about peacemaking, , Egeland writes
that he agrees with the refusal of the government here to negotiate
with right-wing paramilitary groups because they are ``criminal
terrorist organizations that should only be met with to discuss the
laying down of arms.'' His opinion, he added, is that ``the random
killing of fellow citizens in a society should not lead to
negotiations in the presidential palace.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview here, he softened his tone somewhat. The
paramilitaries have ``little political content, and a big human
rights violation content,'' he said, so ``they should be treated
differently from other actors.'' But ``one should not be
categorical about leaving anyone in or out'' of the peace
negotiations, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Such a pragmatic approach would be a concession to the political
realities prevailing here. Previous efforts to negotiate an end to
the conflict have foundered at least in part because there was
nothing to prevent right-wing death squads from killing guerrillas
who had agreed to lay down their arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that some point down the road the paramilitaries
have to be brought into the peace negotiations,'' said Arnson, who
is deputy director of the Latin American program at the Woodrow
Wilson Center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``At what time or circumstances is open to question, but you
can't convince the guerrilla movements to re-enter the political
process so long as their members are subject to elimination,'' he
said, referring to the death squads.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the Clinton administration has kept a distance from
the peace negotiations here because of a ban on contacts with the
guerrillas and on the theory that, as one official in Washington
put it, any formal involvement ``might well be more harmful than
helpful.'' But the State Department welcomes Egeland's presence
``as the injection of another element, curbing rebel misbehavior,''
and said it would not oppose a more prominent role for him.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Egeland is reluctant to discuss assuming a
mediator's role or to speculate about a timetable for peace, other
than to caution that the situation here could just as easily
deteriorate as improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is terrible here, and it could get much worse,'' he said,
before adding that ``part of my job is to be an optimist'' and
suggesting that ``there is no law by nature that says peace will
break out everywhere in Latin America except Colombia.''
</P>
<P>
   In one sign of progress, the government and the Revolutionary
Armed Forces group exchanged proposals _ still pending _ on July 3
for a cease-fire. Egeland said that while ``one should not be
overly optimistic about them agreeing'' to such a step, he did
expect the talks to produce some sort of accord that that would
bring an end to the killing of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should happen this year,'' he said. ``It would be another
great defeat for all of us if it doesn't happen this year.''

NOOSES, SYMBOLS OF RACE HATRED, TAKE SPOTLIGHT IN WORKPLACE
LAWSUITS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Ill., Miss., Fla., Pa. ,  N.C., Texas, Calif., Ga.,
Minn.)  By SANA SIWOLOP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gloria Hamilton never saw a double-looped noose hanging on her
door in 1992. Friends at the Detroit cargo facility where she
worked as a service manager for Northwest Airlines took the noose
down before she came to work that day, she said, so that she would
not be upset seeing it.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, however, Hamilton, who is black, was alerted
to a knotted noose in an employee lunchroom. This time she took the
noose down _ after first taking a picture of it _ and then
complained to a higher manager. The company, which is challenging
Hamilton's account, also says that there is no evidence that the
piece of rope she found was intended to intimidate any employee
because of race or sex.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the way Hamilton sees it. ``I'm old enough to
remember Emmett Till,'' she said, referring to the 1955 lynching of
a black teen-ager from Chicago who was accused of making sexual
remarks about a white woman while visiting relatives in
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   The hangman's noose has long been one of the most frightening
representations of racial harassment in America, a reminder that
thousands of black people died at the hands of lynch mobs from the
end of the Civil War well into the 20th century. But while the
symbolic use of a noose has traditionally been associated with hate
groups like the Ku Klux Klan, employment experts say that nooses,
although still rare, are increasingly turning up in ordinary
workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies still prefer to settle such cases out of court,
but officials at the federal Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission say they have at least 20 noose-related lawsuits pending
or recently resolved. For an agency that files only a few hundred
lawsuits a year, they add, that is a disproportionately high
number. And the agency says it is currently examining dozens of
other allegations involving nooses from around the country.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, officials say, a noose was placed anonymously on
an employee's chair, in a locker, or on a door. But the Miami
office of the equal employment opportunity commission is currently
pursuing a lawsuit on behalf of a black employee, who, while
working for a Florida office of the Asplundh Tree Expert Co.,
reportedly had a noose wrapped around his neck, which was then
pulled. The company, which is based in Willow Grove, Pa., said it
had no comment on the suit.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure why reports of such racial incidents have risen
lately. Some employment lawyers see it as reflecting intolerance
among certain younger workers who were not around during the civil
rights struggles of the 1950s and 1960s. The incidents, experts
say, also may reflect resentment among some whites over affirmative
action in diverse workplaces where blacks and other minorities were
often excluded in the past.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, says Ida L. Castro, the chairwoman of the
equal employment agency, the increase in court cases might also be
due to a growing defensiveness on the part of some employers, who
sometimes treat them ``almost flippantly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I see as alarming is not just that employers are now
fighting us in courts,'' she said, ``but that they're also making
statements implying that such incidents are just horseplay.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a recent exhibit of photographs _ many once used as
postcards _ of white participants in lynchings and their lifeless
black victims only reminded viewers of why nooses are such an
incendiary emblem of America's not-so-distant past.
</P>
<P>
   Noose incidents are popping up all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Lanza, a special agent for the Federal Bureau of
Investigation in Kansas City, Mo., says his office is investigating
two cases of nooses left in workplaces. The regional office of the
equal employment agency in Charlotte, N.C., has three racial
harassment lawsuits pending where nooses were said to be involved.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami office has an equal number, including one in which a
Sanibel Island country club has been charged with failing to act
against several workers accused of holding up a hangman's noose to
a black groundskeeper before asking him whether he wanted ``to go
for a ride.'' Art Cassell, a member of the board of governors of
the Sanctuary Golf Club in Sanibel, Fla., said the suit was
``completely without merit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas office of the commission is investigating four such
cases. In Detroit, the agency is continuing to pursue a lawsuit on
behalf of Hamilton. And the agency has one current lawsuit in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the cases the equal employment office is pursuing may
represent only the tip of a workplace iceberg. The agency handles
just a small fraction of the thousands of lawsuits that are filed
privately between employees and employers each year.
</P>
<P>
   Employment lawyers say that it is impossible to say how many of
those cases involve noose incidents. But David Bennet Ross, a
managing partner at Seyfarth Shaw, a law firm based in Chicago that
represents employers, thinks they ``happen with surprising
frequency.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross said he could think of only one noose-related lawsuit in
which a court had found that an employee had fabricated the claim,
in order to collect money.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a sign,'' he said, ``that something serious is going
on in the workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Serious indeed, say employment lawyers, who add that incidents
involving nooses are now appearing at large and small companies, in
nearly all regions, and are affecting not just black employees, but
also those of Asian, Hispanic, and Native American descent.
</P>
<P>
   Lanza, the Kansas City FBI agent, said that until recently cross
burnings seemed to be the ``hate crime of choice,'' in his area,
but that noose incidents are now appearing instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here 12 years and I can't remember any other noose
cases that preceded the two we now have,'' Lanza said. The Justice
Department considers noose incidents to be federal crimes of
intimidation, punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, racial harassment charges have surged over the last two
decades, with the EEOC reporting that it received close to 50,000
such charges during the 1990s, versus roughly 10,000 in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The agency considers noose incidents to be among the most
egregious forms of racial harassment.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet some employees say they have lost their jobs after speaking
out against racial harassment incidents like the display of nooses.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Harold H. Archuleta, a former mechanic for American
Airlines, filed a lawsuit against the company charging that he had
been wrongfully fired for complaining about aircraft safety
violations, and also for supporting the racial harassment and
discrimination claims of another American employee, Charles L.
Walker.
</P>
<P>
   In his court papers, Archuleta, who is Native American, said
that his superiors at American took no steps to prevent, among
other things, the ``prominent'' display of nooses at the airline's
maintenance facility at Los Angeles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   During the two or three years before he left American in May
1998, Archuleta said he saw three nooses displayed at the
maintenance facility: one in the area where the company gave out
time cards, another in front of a production control office and a
third carried by Walker, as he was on his way to complain about it
to his managers.
</P>
<P>
   Each time he saw a noose at his workplace, Archuleta recalled
recently, he ``couldn't believe it was happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Kincaid, a spokesman for American, a unit of the AMR Corp.,
said that the airline settled Walker's case out of court last fall.
As for Archuleta's suit, Kincaid said that a company investigation
found no evidence of racial harassment at the Los Angeles facility,
and that Archuleta's claims were simply an effort to ``mask his own
misconduct.'' According to American, Archuleta was fired for
failing to remove outdated life vests from certain airplanes, a
charge that he denies.
</P>
<P>
   At Lockheed Martin, the military contractor, seven current and
former hourly employees at its facility in Marietta, Ga., filed a
lawsuit in Atlanta in May alleging that the company had excluded
them from its promotion process. They also stated that Lockheed
Martin management had ignored _ or conducted only a cursory
investigation of _ numerous racial harassment incidents, including
some involving the display of nooses. In the suit, Joseph Banks, a
Lockheed employee who still works for the company, said a hangman's
noose was placed in his work area last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Banks took his complaint about the noose to the equal employment
commission in October last year. On the same day, another Lockheed
employee, Ted Gignilliat, &UR;  &LR; who had earlier accused the company of
discriminating against him because he is disabled, also filed a
complaint that he had received threats after witnessing a noose at
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Gignilliat says that he has seen roughly a half-dozen nooses
displayed during his tenure with Lockheed, and that the two most
recent incidents occurred during the spring of 1999. He says that
he reported the most recent incident last September to Lockheed's
human resources department, but that his effort received no
response, as did another a month later to the security department.
</P>
<P>
   Gignilliat said he was spurred to act, in part, after Lockheed
managers issued memos in August stating that the company thoroughly
investigated all harassment and discrimination claims.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Grizzle, a Lockheed spokesman, said that the noose
Gignilliat reported last fall was already under investigation and
that the company was not aware that he had ever reported any other
incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a response last month to the May lawsuit, Lockheed
denied the employees' charges. In its court papers, Lockheed
acknowledged that a rope tied in the shape of a noose had been
found in Banks' department, but said the rope was not in his work
area. The company, which declined to comment more specifically
because of the litigation, stated that it had investigated the
incident ``immediately and thoroughly,'' but had not been able to
determine who had left the noose.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, the employment lawyer, said he advises companies that have
received a complaint of racial harassment to investigate
immediately. But unlike many other harassment cases, it is usually
difficult to identify the culprits because most nooses are left
anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   In the case involving Hamilton, Northwest Airlines, in its court
papers, said that it learned of the noose incident only after
Hamilton had been denied a promotion, and after she had gone to the
equal employment agency to complain about racial and sexual
harassment at the company. Hamilton said that she had indeed
notified the company when the incident occured.
</P>
<P>
   The company also argued that the noose that Hamilton found was
simply a piece of rope, and that there was no evidence it was
directed against her or any member of a minority group.
</P>
<P>
   The equal employment agency's suit against Northwest involving
Hamilton and some other employees at its Detroit cargo facility has
yet to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in January the agency's San Francisco office also
filed a noose-related lawsuit against Northwest. It charged that
employees at the airline's maintenance department at San Francisco
Airport subjected a Filipino mechanic, Marcel Espiritu, to almost
five years of racial harassment. After Espiritu filed his
accusation with the federal agency, officials say, he found a noose
hanging in his locker, along with a note that read ``get Marcel.''
</P>
<P>
   William R. Tamayo, a regional attorney for the equal employment
agency, says that Northwest Airlines never did enough to
investigate the incident. In response to both cases, Kathy Peach, a
spokeswoman for Northwest, said that it was company policy not to
comment on lawsuits in litigation. ``We believe that it is
dangerous to draw conclusions before the legal process has been
fully completed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Hamilton, the noose she found in 1995 still haunts her.
Last fall, while attending a work-related conference in
Minneapolis, she ran into a Northwest vice president, who showed
her a newspaper article on the lawsuit and then expressed surprise
that she still worked for the airline. Shaken, Hamilton went back
to her hotel room, only to discover while packing that she had
unwittingly hidden the noose at the bottom of her garment bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like getting a double whammy,'' she recalled. ``I need
to find a better place to put it.''

CITING SAFETY, MANY ARE SEEKING END TO SHORT FISHING SEASONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL HULSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For Wayne Werner, a commercial fishing skipper, and
his boat's crew, the frenzied competition for prime catch in the
Gulf of Mexico is a no-win proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Werner, captain of the Wayne's Pain in Galliano, La., says short
seasons for prized fish like red snapper and king mackerel are
proving hazardous, occasionally forcing boat crews to choose
between braving threatening weather and skipping a payday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have 10 days to fish in September and a hurricane comes
along, you either don't fish or you go out and it is dangerous,''
said Werner, 42. He said he knew of three members of Gulf fishing
crews lost in rough seas in recent years, and a couple of boats
sunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are running for 20 hours,'' Werner said. ``It is
inevitable you are going to have accidents. It is just such a race
for fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to restore a bit of calm to fishing in the Gulf and
elsewhere, some fishermen have struck a rare alliance with
conservation groups. They are seeking to end the scramble
associated with the so-called derby approach, in which captains are
given a strict limit of fish to compete for and a brief time to
catch them.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, red snapper fishing was allowed in the first 10
days of February, March and April but was cut off early in May when
the spring quota of 3 million pounds was reached. The fall season
will open Sept. 1 with a smaller goal of about 1.6 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Those unhappy with this system would instead allot fishermen
individual quotas, enabling captains to spread their trips out over
the year, reducing risk and making fresh fish more regularly
available at the seafood counter.
</P>
<P>
   Under a typical quota program, the total catch of a species
would be divided among eligible captains, each receiving shares
based on his fishing history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The derby fishery is unnecessarily subjecting us to dangerous
conditions all the time,'' said Felix Cox, a snapper captain from
Aransas Pass, Texas. ``We don't have the flexibility to make the
judgment calls it takes to run a business like this.''
</P>
<P>
   A four-year federal moratorium on new individual fishing quota
programs is to expire Sept. 30. But some members of Congress,
moving to protect fishing interests in their regions that oppose
the idea, are poised to extend the moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Olympia J. Snowe, the Maine Republican who is chairwoman of
the Commerce Subcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries, wants to keep
the ban in place for three more years as part of a fishery
management measure facing a committee vote. Snowe has enlisted
backing from the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, R-Miss., those
following the legislation say.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Snowe said that even though a series of hearings
she had conducted found support for individual quotas in the Gulf
of Mexico and the Pacific Northwest, the senator was worried that
they could be acquired by large commercial interests that would
squeeze out smaller independent fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Lackey, an aide to Snowe, said that in New England the
individual quotas were ``pretty broadly opposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all environmental groups are ready to see the moratorium
expire either. Lee Crockett, executive director of the Marine Fish
Conservation Network, an umbrella organization of environmental and
commercial fishing groups, said the moratorium should not be lifted
without the enactment of strict regulations. Those would include a
fair allocation system, a five-year term on any quotas and a
mechanism to let conservation groups buy and hold quota shares _
never actually catching the fish _ to protect and replenish fish
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental Defense, a group that advocates market-based
techniques to protect the environment, is strongly behind the
fishermen in their push for individual quotas, calling them a
common-sense solution to fishing problems like weather risks and
the discarding of millions of pounds of fish unintentionally caught
out of season.
</P>
<P>
   The group has been lining up support for eliminating the
moratorium from senators like Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, and
John B. Breaux, D-La. Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, who was a chief
proponent of the ban when it was imposed in 1996, has signaled a
softening in his stance. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the probable
Republican presidential nominee, also favors individual quotas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tool vests fishermen with an incentive to conserve the
fishery, eliminates such bureaucratic restrictions as minimum size
limits and season closings and reduces dangerous operating
conditions,'' Bush wrote in an April 28 letter to Hutchison.
</P>
<P>
   A National Research Council report issued last year also
recommended that regional fishery councils be given the option of
trying individual quotas, a concept in limited use domestically but
employed on a broad scale internationally.
</P>
<P>
   A study of Alaskan halibut, one of the few fish covered by
individual quotas, done for Environmental Defense found measurable
safety improvements since the mid-1990s, when fishermen were
allowed a few chaotic 24-hour periods each year in which to make
their catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one 24-hour opening, 2,000 or more boats might enter the
fishing grounds, regardless of weather conditions, each setting
excessive amounts of gear in a make-or-break race to land a full
year's catch,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Search-and-rescue missions by the Coast Guard were reduced to
seven in 1996 from 33 in 1994 under the halibut quota system. No
halibut-fishing fatalities occurred from 1995 to 1996, compared
with 11 from 1991 to 1994, Environmental Defense said.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen say some of the opposition to individual quotas comes
from fish dealers and processors, who enjoy an advantage under the
current system because the supply of fish is so large during short
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the dealer has control,'' said Cox, the Texas fishermen,
who said Gulf fishermen were getting prices for snapper and
mackerel below those of a decade ago. ``With quotas, the fisherman
would regain the power he has lost through regulation over the
years.''

`ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS' TEAM HAS NEW SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The team that produced ``Absolutely Fabulous,'' one of the most
successful comedy series ever imported to the United States from
England, has created another series that will have its premiere on
the BBC early next year before it eventually makes its way to two
cable channels in the United States, BBC America and Comedy
Central.
</P>
<P>
   The show, ``Mirrorball,'' will star Jennifer Saunders and Joanna
Lumley, the two women who also starred in ``Ab-Fab,'' as the
previous hit series came to be called. Saunders, who wrote the
original, will also write this series, which will focus on
theatrical characters involved in London's West End musicals.
</P>
<P>
   The two actresses will play new characters, one a former dancer,
the other a former disco diva, both past their prime but still
game. Paul Lee, the chief operating officer of BBC America,
described the show as ``irreverent, indecent and completely
inebriated,'' three adjectives that were often attached to the
previous series.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the rest of the supporting cast from ``Absolutely
Fabulous'' will also reappear as new characters, including Julia
Sawalha, June Whitfield and Jane Horrocks. Horrocks, who also
starred in the stage and movie versions of ``Little Voice,'' will
play an Icelandic waitress-singer in the new series.
</P>
<P>
   The deal to bring ``Mirrorball'' to the United States involves
both BBC America and Comedy Central because BBC America, which is
seeking to expand its distribution on American cable systems, will
carry the pilot while Comedy Central, which built ``Absolutely
Fabulous'' into a significant cable hit, will then gain rights to
the rest of the series. The number of episodes has not been
determined.

PROTESTANT PROTESTS IN ULSTER BEGIN PEACEFULLY BUT TURN VIOLENT 
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland _ A demonstration by the Orange
Order, a traditional Protestant organization, over a ban on the
group's marching route through a Catholic neighborhood began
peacefully Sunday, but in the evening demonstrators clashed with
British soldiers, throwing bottles and rocks and trying to break
through barricades.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by bands of accordion players and drummers,
Orangemen in ceremonial bowler hats and orange sashes marched from
the center of Portadown to the Drumcree church, where they were
stopped by a barrier. The British army had built the 20-foot high
steel and concrete barrier to prevent the men from returning to
town along the Garvaghy Road, in a largely Catholic residential
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,000 Orangemen and supporters rallied for an hour after
the blocked march as religious leaders offered up prayer and
political invective. Despite pouring rain, hundreds of supporters
remained at the scene after the rally. Later, the crowd grew again,
as about 1,000 demonstrators clashed with the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here this morning with one aim: to have our civil and
religious liberties restored,'' said the Portadown Orangemen's
leader, Harold Gracey who called for province-wide protests on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Protestant parades throughout July commemorate ancient victories
over Catholics. The most famous is the Battle of the Boyne, where
King William IV of England defeated the forces of the Catholic
king, James II, in 1690. It is celebrated on July 12.
</P>
<P>
   Protestants were blocked from marching through the Catholic
neighborhood two years ago, leading to an extended sit-in at
Drumcree. Since then, a power-sharing home-rule government
including both Protestants and Catholics began functioning in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   This year's period of tension before the so-called marching
season included bonfires, carjackings and confrontations with the
police by people who said they were supporting the Drumcree cause.
The incidents began in Belfast last Sunday and continued throughout
the week.
</P>
<P>
   In two incidents early Sunday, an Orange Order hall in nearby
Cookstown was burned in an attack attributed to arson, and a car
bomb in nearby Stewartstown shattered windows in homes. Chief
Constable Ronnie Flanagan of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the
Northern Irish police force, said the car bomb was probably the
work of a dissident republican group called the Real IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, accused
Protestant paramilitary organizations of hijacking the Portadown
Orange Order's cause for their own ends. ``The time for legitimate
protest is behind us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the rally Sunday, Gracey refused to distance himself from the
week's disturbances. ``I'm not in the business of condemning
violence,'' he said. He had urged Protestants to come out Sunday in
protest to show security forces ``what the Ulsterman is all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Adair, a Protestant paramilitary leader who was recently
released from prison, showed up at Sunday's demonstration. He had
appeared at the the Church of Ireland in Drumcree on Tuesday,
contributing to fears of further violence.
</P>
<P>
   The protests did not go uncriticized by Protestants, though. The
Church of Ireland primate, Robin Eames, archbishop of Armagh,
condemned the standoff, saying, ``I see nothing of Jesus Christ in
the nightly actions on Drumcree Hill or in the roads and streets of
Northern Ireland night by night.''

TOUR ENTERS THE PYRENEES WITH HEAVY WINDS AND CHILL FORECAST 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAX, France _ Nine days and hundreds of kilometers after it
started, the Tour de France really begins Monday, and storm signals
are flying. That is not a metaphor: The weather forecast when the
bicycle race enters the Pyrenees is for rain, snow, fog, winds up
to 37 mph and temperatures as low as 43 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   In similar conditions in 1996, the jewel Alpine stage was
shortened in fear that the racers would be endangered if they tried
to traverse the Galibier peak in howling winds after a freak
snowfall. Few daily stages have been curtailed or canceled because
of bad weather since the Tour began in 1903.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the grim prediction from the French Weather Service,
which is often inaccurate, the 10th stage in the three-week Tour
shaped up as a storm. ``On paper, the Tour opens July 10,'' Lance
Armstrong, the defending champion, said before the actual start,
July 1.
</P>
<P>
   After the long period of wandering around the flatlands and
small hills of western France, the race will begin to move steeply
up and the outlines of its final shape will emerge. Except for the
two time trials, most of the favorites have ridden anonymously in
the pack until now.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Ullrich, Marco Pantani, Abraham Olano, Alex Zulle, Laurent
Jalabert, Fernando Escartin, Laurent Dufaux, Richard Virenque,
Bobby Julich and Armstrong _ none of the contenders' names figured
Sunday in the results of the ninth stage.
</P>
<P>
   Instead the major names were Paolo Bettini, Geert Verheyen, Jose
Angel Vidal and Didier Rous, a breakaway group that barely held off
the main pack of chasers to finish in that order after a 112-mile
rolling stage in gloomily overcast and breezy weather that may look
like paradise Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bettini, an Italian with Mapei, was timed in 4 hours 29 minutes
6 seconds, a speed of about 25 mph. The stage to Dax began in Agen,
an occasional Tour stop and the prune capital of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Elli, an Italian with Telekom, continued in the overall
leader's yellow jersey ahead of Fabrice Gougot, a Frenchman with
Credit Agricole, and Marc Wauters, a Belgian with Rabobank.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those names should be missing from the news Monday.
Weather permitting, the big boys should be back.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first day in the mountains can set the tone for the rest
of the Tour,'' Bobby Julich, the American leader of the Credit
Agricole team, said. ``It's time to sink or swim.''
</P>
<P>
   Where do the winners of the last three Tours stand before the
first of five days of steep climbing, spread over the next eight
days, in the Pyrenees, the Midi and the Alps?
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, the Texan who leads the U.S. Postal Service team and
trails the leader by nearly six minutes, appears to be in splendid
position. ``I'm feeling good, though how good I'll know Monday
night,'' he said Saturday. ``The team hasn't had to work hard the
first week and we're ready.''
</P>
<P>
   He seemed relaxed and confident, yet on edge, like a man eager
for battle. Glancing at the French sports newspaper l'Equipe,
Armstrong read aloud an item in which German reporters had been
polled about the eventual winner. Eighteen voted for Ullrich, the
German leader of Telekom and the champion in 1997, 10 for Armstrong
and one for Zulle, the Swiss leader of Banesto, who was second last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten's enough,'' Armstrong said with a smile. Although he will
not put it into words, he regards Ullrich as his main rival and
proceeded to discuss the German's weight, an annual problem.
Armstrong said he thought that Ullrich still weighed about 2
kilograms, or 4.4 pounds, too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were two kilos over, I wouldn't be a factor,'' he said.
``Two kilos over the course of a day of climbing, that's plenty.
One kilo is too much.''
</P>
<P>
   He may be wrong about Ullrich's condition, however. To others,
the German, who is six and a half minutes behind, looks fit. The
spare tire around his middle that was evident in races last month
has melted in the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``His head is good,'' said Telekom's directeur sportif, Walter
Godefroot. ``That's where his problems start, in his morale. And
now his morale is strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the 1998 Tour, Marco Pantani, the Italian leader
of the Mercatone Uno team, has also been troubled since he was
ousted from the Giro d'Italia last year for failing a blood test
that indicated the use of illegal drugs. But he too has seemed
restored in this Tour.
</P>
<P>
   The best climber of the three champions, Pantani will get his
chance to start reducing an 11-minute deficit Monday, weather
permitting. &QL;

   TAX-CUT-POLITICS (Washington) _ With projections of the federal
budget surplus rising and both parties in full election-year mode,
the debate over tax cuts is shifting from whether to what kinds.
Republicans continue to press for bigger reductions than most
Democrats will support, and the super-charged politics of the
campaign season will make it difficult for any tax cuts to be
enacted before a new president and Congress take office next year.
But in Washington and on the campaign trail, Democrats from
President Clinton on down are joining Republicans in backing tax
cuts -- enthusiastically in some cases, grudgingly and with
conditions in others -- to a far greater degree than they were a

MRS. CLINTON SAYS LIFTING GASOLINE TAX WOULD BE A `SERIOUS ERROR' 
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UTICA, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton continued her emphasis on
economic issues Sunday, renewing her call for the Federal Trade
Commission to broaden its investigation of sharply increased
gasoline prices and urging Congress to pass legislation to create
an oil reserve for states in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth day of her Senate campaign tour through western
New York, Clinton rejected as ``a serious error'' any move to
eliminate the gasoline tax, a proposal advocated her Republican
rival, Rep. Rick A. Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reject my opponent's proposal of eliminating the gas tax,''
Clinton said, speaking a a press conference earlier in Rochester.
``One of the few sources of revenue that we actually get more of
than we send to Washington is gas tax money for our transportation
needs. It would be hard to imagine how upstate can finish all the
work we need to do without the federal help that comes from
transportation dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   On the investigation of gasoline prices, Clinton said it is
imperative for the commission to ``go beyond where it has already
begun to try to figure out why, while fuel costs have gone up over
50 cents in New York, profits for major oil companies have gone up
more than 500 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   In a tour of a dozen communities, Clinton has sought to discuss
policies that would affect the troubled economy of western New
York.
</P>
<P>
   While her campaign has dubbed the trip as the ``Upstate Economic
Tour,'' it has been more of a cookout and picnic tour. The first
lady has appeared at picnics and rallies sponsored by the
Democratic Party in upstate counties. Sunday afternoon, she
addressed a gathering in Van Buren, N.Y., hosted by party officials
of Cayuga, Oswego and Onondaga counties. She addressed another
gathering of Democrats from five counties Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been asked most frequently about her ideas and
proposals to revive the economy in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   She began Sunday at Mount Olivet Baptist Church in Rochester. It
had not been announced in advance to members of the church that
Clinton would be there, and her presence seemed to take nearly
everyone by surprise. Seated beside William Johnson, the mayor of
Rochester, Clinton swayed and clapped to the music by the choir.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand here today before you today to thank those of you who
prayed for me and my husband,'' Clinton told the congregation. ``I
believe that we were both sustained and uplifted because of prayer.
And so I thank you and ask you not to quit yet.''

 &HT;    `X-Men' just latest to be trying screen
 &HT;    By Don Fernandez
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Comic books may not be highly profitable in
themselves, but as properties for other media, they're priceless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The revenue from film and television can be 500 to 1,000 times
what comics bring,'' said Matt Hawkins, editor in chief of Top Cow
Comics in San Diego. ``They're invaluable.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Top Cow`s characters, Witchblade _ a female detective who
possesses a mystical gauntlet _ will debut as a two-hour television
pilot on Atlanta-based TNT in August.
</P>
<P>
   DC Comics' Batman and Superman have been lucrative television
and movie franchises. ``Dick Tracy'' and ``Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles'' conquered the box office in the early 1990s. Long before
Jim Carrey donned green face paint, ``The Mask'' was a Dark Horse
Comics creation. ``Men in Black,'' ``Blade,'' ``The Crow'' and
``Spawn'' were all born in comics before film. Even TV's ``Sabrina
the Teenage Witch'' has comic-book roots.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a highly anticipated movie version of ``The X-Men,''
one of the most popular comic book series of all time, will hit
theaters. Film deals are also in the works for ``Spider-Man,''
``The Hulk'' and ``The Fantastic Four,'' and new Superman and
Batman movies are possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins expects 50 percent of Top Cow's revenue to come from
movies and television within a few years, up from the current 20
percent. Another of the company's books, ``The Darkness,'' is in
development at Columbia Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood is finding comics more interesting,'' Hawkins said.
``You have the characters, costume designs and the storyboards
already done.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Jenkins writes the monthly ``Witchblade'' book, as well as
``Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' and ``The Hulk'' for Marvel. With
those characters soon getting their own live-action movies, he
thinks the spotlight may lead people back to comic books.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't hurt,'' Jenkins said. ``The way you can tell a story
in comics is like no other medium.''

 &HT;    Threatened by the Internet, comic books now are turning to it as
possible salvation
 &HT;    By Don Fernandez
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After crushing every cosmic threat that came their
way, comic book heroes such as the Fantastic Four and Spider-Man
are now fighting for their own future _ and it may be downloadable.
</P>
<P>
   Costumed crime fighters, who have thrived for years in comic
books, need a hero themselves. Comic book sales have steadily
declined as computer games and the Internet draw potential readers
away.
</P>
<P>
   Some comic publishers hope that same technology can rescue them.
Artists are turning from pencils to pixels as their companies
explore online comics, Internet animation and other computer-based
graphic technologies to reach new readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think in time digital comics will probably eclipse their
printed forebears,'' said Scott McCloud, author of ``Understanding
Comics'' and one of the industry's top analysts. ``The function of
print is going to shift. You're going to find electronic
distribution is the best way to communicate. This year, you're
going to see amazing growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Comic books emerged as a major form of escapism during World War
II. Colorful tales of superhuman patriotism, romance, humor and
adventure captured millions of readers monthly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not uncommon for a comic to hit a million'' in sales,
said John Miller, managing editor of Comics Buyer's Guide, the
industry newspaper. ``Comics were the nation's baby sitter. It was
cheap to pay 10 cents and keep Junior busy. It was the peak of the
comic book as an icon of American culture.''
</P>
<P>
   But after the war came television, and comic book circulation
began dropping. The books had all but disappeared from newsstands
by the 1970s. Specialty comic shops arose, often with an atmosphere
unfriendly to potential new readers. And the average book, once
just a dime, now sells for $2.50 to $2.99 _ or more.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a comic title is considered impressive if it sells
250,000 copies a month. In 1999, the industry's total take was $275
million.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers hope the Internet will make their tales more
affordable and accessible. The early efforts range from still
images to drawings with limited movement. Some offerings more
resemble cartoons than comics, with lots of motion, sound effects,
voices and music.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to see some major changes over the next 10 years.
We all have to look at technology improvements,'' said Cliff
Biggers, publisher of Marietta, Ga.-based Comic Shop News, the
country's largest comics trade publication. ``This is a big debate
going on in the industry, and it's too early to see how it's going
to shake out.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvel Comics, one of the two industry leaders, is going beyond
comics to capitalize on its many characters. Movie deals (such as
``The X-Men,'' opening Friday) and merchandising draw cash that
dwarfs the profits of the most successful 22-page comic book.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get back to basics and tell our comic stories
online,'' said Bill Jemas, president of publishing and new media at
Marvel Enterprises in New York. ``It's a wonderful opportunity to
reach a whole new generation with comic books.''
</P>
<P>
   Click to the Omnitheatre section of www.marvel.com and you'll
find CyberComics: original stories of Marvel heroes using limited
animation and sound effects that complement the comic book titles.
Marvel.com soon will introduce ``Spider-Cam,'' a series of online
comics that use photographs instead of artwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in our heart a company that has to do a lot of things
at the same time to be successful,'' Jemas said. ``Comic writing
and storytelling is a great way to be inventive and take great
risks. But to reach a lot of consumers, big media is a must.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Stan Lee _ the writer-editor who launched Spider-Man, the
Hulk and other popular Marvel superheroes in the 1960s _ has jumped
to the web. His StanLee.net site offers original comic characters.
``The 7th Portal,'' about computer beta-testers who become
superheroes, and another series, ``Accuser,'' make major use of
animation and music, with voices instead of printed dialog
balloons.
</P>
<P>
   Just 1 1/2 years after debuting, the material on stanlee.net has
already spawned merchandise, movie deals and plans for theme park
rides.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (Lee) published his books at Marvel, it worked because it
was the most cost-effective medium to reach the biggest audience
with a superhero story,'' said stanlee.net co-founder Peter Paul.
``Now the biggest medium is the Internet. It makes no sense to go
back to an anachronistic technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 77, is invigorated by the response to his Internet venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so instantaneous,'' Lee said. ``In comic books, it takes
so long to print it. It takes time to get reaction and know how
much it sold. On the Internet, one second later you can get
comments.The Internet is going to be the most powerful force for
information and entertainment that the world has ever known.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if this is the evolution of comics books,'' he
said. ``I think it's just another way to tell bigger-than-life,
high-concept stories. Everybody's going to want to get into it.
Eventually, you have to get into it.''
</P>
<P>
   But DC Comics _ the industry's top-selling publisher _ isn't
putting Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman online yet. ``To my
knowledge we have nothing in development right now,'' said Patty
Jeras, spokeswoman for DC Comics in New York. ``Marvel is being
much more aggressive on this front than we are.'' DC is owned by
Time Warner, and other branches of that conglomerate are exploring
online comics, often with DC's characters.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros.' entertaindom.com offers ``The Multipath Adventures
of Superman,'' a series of 30 original cartoon shorts featuring
Superman, some written by comic book authors.
</P>
<P>
   Other comics material is available at www.warnerbros.com,
including a series based on ``The Matrix.'' Female characters from
the Batman titles will get their own online series, ``Gotham
Girls,'' later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Small companies and independent creators are also exploring
Internet options.
</P>
<P>
   Dark Horse Comics, which publishes tales based on such TV shows
as ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ``Xena: Warrior Princess,'' has
versions of these on www.darkhorse.com. One series, ``The Haunted
Man,'' is created exclusively for online, using limited animation.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Eliopoulos was hunting for a way to expose his offbeat
series ``Desperate Times'' and keep production costs down. Soon
he'll be a comic pioneer of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   In a few months, ``Desperate Times'' will be the first comic to
be offered through the Internet as an eBook. Using free technology
from software company JamBooks, readers will be able to download
and read his series on a computer, Palm Pilot or similar device.
</P>
<P>
   The cost: only $1 an issue, compared with $3 on a comic store
shelf. A $15 trade paperback featuring previously printed material
will cost $4 as a download.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be a good test market,'' Eliopoulos said. ``I've
got a fan base; people have read the book. But ... a lot of people
were afraid to spend $3 on a book they didn't know if they would
like, which killed a lot of potential buyers. Hopefully
(downloadable comics) won't scare people off so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Artist Phil Jimenez, who writes and draws ``Wonder Woman,'' and
has drawn both Marvel's X-Men and DC's Justice League of America,
is negotiating another superhero project that would debut online.
Comics, he said, will likely evolve into another art form
altogether as the concepts and characters converge with technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think simply it's a natural evolution,'' Jimenez said. ``A
large amount of material will be available online, and some of it
exclusively. I would be creating characters and environments that
would be turned into three-dimensional images by computer people.''
</P>
<P>
   Writer/artist Brian Michael Bendis has been hired by Marvel to
write two new comic book versions of ``Spider-Man'' and ``The
Fantastic Four.'' But for his independently owned crime series,
``Jinx,'' he's creating an animated version to premiere on the
Internet next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do see room for both,'' he said. ``But I still see the value
of printing the work.''
</P>
<P>
   McCloud`s just-published ``Reinventing Comics'' expounds on the
need for creators to embrace technology so the art form can evolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have great hope for the Web as a means for artists and
readers to connect and as a way for the medium of comics to grow
into some exciting new shapes,'' McCloud said. ``Technology has an
enormous role to play in comics growth in the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   But can a computer image compete with a book that can be held
and thumbed through? Will collectors, who have hundreds of comics
sealed in plastic bags and stored in boxes, be drawn to building an
electronic library?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a strong fetish factor,'' Comic Buyer's Guide's John
Miller said. ``Whereas the recording industry has had to worry
about people copying exact duplicates of its songs, comics haven't.
People really still want to have the physical item.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds writer-artist Bendis: ``You can't replace the feeling of
reading a comic. You can read nearly every magazine for free online
but people still buy them. People like touching paper.''

</P>
<P>
   ``The revenue from film and television can be 500 to 1,000 times
what comics bring,'' said Matt Hawkins, editor in chief of Top Cow
Comics in San Diego. ``They're invaluable.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Top Cow`s characters, Witchblade _ a female detective who
possesses a mystical gauntlet _ will debut as a two-hour television
pilot on Atlanta-based TNT in August.
</P>
<P>
   DC Comics' Batman and Superman have been lucrative television
and movie franchises. ``Dick Tracy'' and ``Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles'' conquered the box office in the early 1990s. Long before
Jim Carrey donned green face paint, ``The Mask'' was a Dark Horse
Comics creation. ``Men in Black,'' ``Blade,'' ``The Crow'' and
``Spawn'' were all born in comics before film. Even TV's ``Sabrina
the Teenage Witch'' has comic-book roots.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a highly anticipated movie version of ``The X-Men,''
one of the most popular comic book series of all time, will hit
theaters. Film deals are also in the works for ``Spider-Man,''
``The Hulk'' and ``The Fantastic Four,'' and new Superman and
Batman movies are possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins expects 50 percent of Top Cow's revenue to come from
movies and television within a few years, up from the current 20
percent. Another of the company's books, ``The Darkness,'' is in
development at Columbia Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood is finding comics more interesting,'' Hawkins said.
``You have the characters, costume designs and the storyboards
already done.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Jenkins writes the monthly ``Witchblade'' book, as well as
``Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' and ``The Hulk'' for Marvel. With
those characters soon getting their own live-action movies, he
thinks the spotlight may lead people back to comic books.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't hurt,'' Jenkins said. ``The way you can tell a story
in comics is like no other medium.''

AMERICAN DANCE FESTIVAL AT DUKE FEATURES JANE COMFORT'S
`DANCE-OPERA' 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ The guiding spirits behind the theater of mixed
forms are often choreographers.
</P>
<P>
   Theatrical directors may not be able to choreograph, but a
dance-trained artist is used to conceiving the integration of
movement with rhythm: the rhythm of music and even words, spoken or
sung. That is what Jane Comfort, one of the most fertile minds in
this genre, has realized so effectively in the first part of what
she calls a three-act ``dance-opera.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire piece, directed and choreographed by Comfort, will be
called ``Asphalt.'' So was its first act, which was commissioned by
the American Dance Festival and presented in Reynolds Industries
Theater at the festival's home here at Duke University. At this
point it is a sketch for an urban ode, the beginning of a tale
about a homeless disc jockey whose repressed memories promise to be
revealed throughout ``Asphalt.''
</P>
<P>
   The characters from his past were not yet fleshed out in this
performance on July 5. Yet Comfort and Carl Hancock Rux, who wrote
the lyrics of the songs and the book (with ``dramaturgy'' by Morgan
Jenness), have already produced a polished nonlinear narrative. The
layers of meaning, evoked in a rap and jazz style, promise to peel
away as the tale unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   Manchild, the lead singer and writer for the hip-hop band Urban
Folklore, portrays the ingeniously named hero, Racine. Like the
French playwright of that name, he is in search of the unities of
time and place. Homeless, he is picked up by the equally
wonderfully named Couchette. Aleta Hayes is this stripper, who
tells him, ``I am a modern dancer, aesthetically.''
</P>
<P>
   He says, ``I like your music.''
</P>
<P>
   She retorts, ``Don't be abstract.''
</P>
<P>
   In their street-smart dialogue, words and dancing are not
separated. As Racine talks and moves his arms in curves, the shapes
become abstractions of his turntable spinning. Hayes, stunning and
swivel-hipped in a long, undulating dance with wide leg swings,
keeps asking Racine, ``What do you remember?'' He repeatedly
replies, ``Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the structure fits pieces of his memory together through
intercutting images, always amplified in dance by a small
karate-kicking chorus (Cynthia Bueschel, Stephen Nunley, Elizabeth
Haselwood). Julius Hollingsworth imposes his grand theatrical
presence as a suspect preacher. He tears pages from a Bible and
claims a pregnant woman is his 14-year-old niece, portrayed with
sullen innocence by Nakia. As she lies in a bloodied dress, the
agony of her birth-giving is duplicated by Racine, contorted in
kinetic empathy. It is up to Irene Datcher, serene in her
jazz-flavored aria, to tell Racine that the girl was his mother.
</P>
<P>
   One has to wait for further installments to make sense of minor
characters who pass through the tenement that Couchette describes
as the symbol of Racine's past.
</P>
<P>
   With music by Toshi Reagon, DJ Spooky and Foosh, ``Asphalt''
could be called dance theater or music theater. If it is a
dance-opera, it is chamber size.
</P>
<P>
   But as Comfort showed on the same program in ``Underground
River,'' previously seen in New York, an inner life can be defined
with imaginative simplicity. In this poignant piece the lively
abstract dances performed by Hayes, Bueschel, Haselwood, Nunley and
a tiny cloth puppet created by Basil Twist become metaphors for a
spirit that slips away. The cumulative emotion brought the audience
to its feet.
</P>
<P>
   Long the prime center for experiment in modern dance, the
festival has never defined what modern dance must be. Comfort
exemplifies these open frontiers. They were symbolized as well by
the disparate teachers and choreographers honored with the
festival's teaching award, the Balasaraswati/Joy Ann Dewey Beinecke
Chairs for Distinguished Teaching. The recipients were Mary
Anthony, Jane Dudley, Sophie Maslow and Walter Nicks.

WEEKEND OF FAUX FRIGHT HELPS BOX OFFICE REBOUND 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
  HOLLYWOOD _ The summer box-office slump is officially over.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Scary Movie,'' a raunchy spoof of teen-age horror flicks that
cost $19 million to make, earned an estimated $42.5 million at the
nation's box offices over the weekend, roughly $1 million more than
``The Perfect Storm'' earned in its opening last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second-biggest opening of the year (behind $57.8
million for ``Mission: Impossible 2'' over Memorial Day), the
biggest opening ever for an R-rated movie and the biggest opening
ever for Miramax Films.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood has made so many horror movies in recent years,
including our own `Scream' series, that the genre was ripe for a
spoof,'' said Bob Weinstein, who runs Miramax with his brother,
Harvey. ``And then we decided to put the movie out in the
summertime, against all these big studio behemoths. They are one
type of movie, and we're another. Our special effects are laughs,
and they're very inexpensive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Scary Movie,'' directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans, drew decidedly
mixed reviews for its gleefully vulgar jabs at films like ``The
Blair Witch Project'' and ``I Know What You Did Last Summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Miramax was also eager to point out that its exit polling showed
that about one-third of the movie's audience was over 25, a much
older demographic than teen-age slasher movies usually enjoy. ``It
just tells you the audience wants comedy,'' said Dennis Rice,
president of marketing for Miramax.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Dergarabedian, chairman of Exhibitor Relations, a Los
Angeles company that monitors box-office performance, said ``Scary
Movie'' succeeded because it was the first recent wide release to
be aimed primarily at a young audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the critics were saying, `The movie looks really cheesy,
it looks like it was shot on video,' but so what?'' Dergarabedian
said. ``The most voracious filmgoing audience, young people, is
ready and eager to go to the theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, when box-office figures were slumping, the top weekend
openings were generally $20 million to $25 million, and the dropoff
as movies went into their second and third weekends was often quite
severe. Now the story is different.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did ``The Perfect Storm'' and ``Scary Movie'' earn more
than $40 million in their openings, but several other movies were
also holding up well. This weekend's estimated box-office total for
the top 12 films was $136.6 million, an increase of 26 percent from
the same weekend last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Perfect Storm'' earned $27.7 million in its second
weekend, a drop of about 35 percent, indicating that it should
continue to draw sizable audiences in coming weeks. Dan Fellman,
president of distribution at Warner Brothers, said the film became
only the third movie in the studio's history to earn $100 million
in 10 days; the other two were Batman movies. ``What's nice about
it is it shows that the box office has come back,'' Fellman said.
</P>
<P>
   The news was also quite good for two other films, ``The
Patriot'' and ``Chicken Run.''
</P>
<P>
   In its second weekend, ``The Patriot,'' the Revolutionary War
epic starring Mel Gibson, earned an estimated $15.5 million, a drop
of only 31 percent from its opening, indicating that it, too, will
probably play well in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really has the earmarks of a film that adults want to see,
but they're not necessarily going to run out over the opening
weekend,'' Dergarabedian said. ``I think `The Patriot' will have
long legs.''
</P>
<P>
   The stop-motion animation of ``Chicken Run'' has apparently
captured the family audience, earning an estimated $9.5 million in
its third weekend, a drop of only 28 percent from last weekend, for
a total of $63.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Disney's `The Kid,''' a family-oriented time-travel
fantasy in which Bruce Willis' character meets himself as a boy,
opened in fourth place this weekend with a relatively disappointing
$12.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The new Jim Carrey comedy, ``Me, Myself and Irene,'' also
continued to stumble, dropping 40 percent in its third weekend, to
$8 million.

STAFF EXPECTS CLINTON DECISION THIS SUMMER ON MISSILE DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb., Del.)   By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senior advisers to President Clinton said Sunday
that they still expected him to decide this summer whether to
proceed with a missile defense system, but they acknowledged that
the failure of a major test on Saturday made it far more likely
that Clinton's successor would ultimately decide the fate of the
huge project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this does go to the question of technical
feasibility or how far along the system is,'' Sandy Berger,
Clinton's national security adviser, said Sunday on the CBS show
``Face the Nation.'' He left open the possibility that Clinton
could decide to defer construction of the anti-missile system,
which would be designed to ward off limited attacks by countries
possessing only a few nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The practical effect of the failure is that whatever decision
the president makes, it will now be easier for the next president
to modify,'' one senior official said. Another added: ``Whether you
think the whole thing is a good idea or a bad one, we're running
out of time'' to make much of a difference while Clinton is still
in office.
</P>
<P>
   The flaw that doomed the test had nothing to do with the most
sophisticated elements of the system, which are supposed to track
an incoming missile, differentiate it from a limited number of
decoys and intercept it before it hits the United States. Instead,
the 130-pound interceptor failed to separate from the booster
rocket that would have sent it speeding toward its target. As a
result, the ``kill vehicle'' got nowhere near the target.
</P>
<P>
   The dismal result fueled the arguments of those who say the
defense system is a waste of money and will disturb relations with
Russia and China. At the other end of the spectrum, it also gave
fuel to supporters of the project who argue that Clinton's plan is
insufficiently ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technological piece of this is not yet in place,'' Sen.
Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who is a strong supporter of missile defense,
said, also appearing on CBS. ``The cost obviously is not in place.
I don't think we've brought our allies on _ I don't think we've
handled that very well _ and how we're dealing with the Russians
and Chinese on this are important.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So therefore,'' he added, ``it's only responsible in my
opinion to allow the next administration working with the new
Congress to start making these decisions.'' A number of lawmakers
in both parties made the same point Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference a week ago, President Clinton said he
expected to decide about the next step in ``a few weeks.'' Berger
appeared to extend that deadline, saying he still expected a
decision ``this summer.'' He said the Pentagon would have to make a
full assessment of what went wrong, based on data beamed back to
earth before the interceptor plunged into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   One lesson Pentagon planners and the White House may draw from
the test is that any missile defense system may require a
significantly larger fleet of anti-missile rockets than now
planned.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force learned this lesson in the aftermath of the 1986
Challenger accident, when military leaders concluded that the
shuttle flights would not be frequent enough to lift their spy
satellites into space. They shifted the satellite launchings back
to unmanned rockets. But the failure rate of those launchings was
higher than initially expected.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the arithmetic of offensive and defensive missile
launchings almost always favors the country initiating an attack.
Even if half or more of its rockets are intercepted, an attack can
be considered a success. But if even a few rockets make it through
a defensive shield _ leading to a nuclear disaster that takes
thousands of lives _ the shield may well be considered a failure.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, several advisers to George W. Bush, the
presumptive Republican nominee, are urging him to support a system
that edges back toward Ronald Reagan's ``Star Wars'' dreams rather
than President Clinton's limited defense.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan, one of Bush's advisers said, was designed to
``come up with the smallest possible program to meet the standard,
and it never had a strategic context.'' It was chiefly intended, he
argued, to protect Vice President Al Gore from the charge of being
too soft on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Clinton decides in coming months, said the adviser, who
insisted on anonymity, ``we have to go back and look at the
strategic logic.''
</P>
<P>
   That reassessment could also examine the nuclear threat that the
system would deter. The failure of this test may only encourage
nations like China, which is believed to have only two dozen
intercontinental missiles, to vastly increase their arsenals in
order to overwhelm any defensive system.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, any new president may have to reassess the
nature of the threat from what the State Department previously
called ``rogue nations.'' North Korea's recent opening to the South
has prompted questions about whether its leaders may be rational
enough to be deterred by the prospect of a retaliatory attack _
much as the old Soviet Union was during the Cold War. Referring to
North Korea, Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., said Sunday: ``The threat
is not at all clear to me.''

SECRET WORK AT LAB HALTED AFTER A LAPSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., N.M.)   By JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Classified work at the federal government's Pacific
Northwest National Laboratory has been suspended as a result of a
security lapse, according to Energy Department and laboratory
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Laboratory officials suspended all classified work at the
installation in Richland, Wash., after an employee discovered a
classified document had been left in an unclassified but locked
office for about a day. Officials said classified work was stopped
on July 3, after the classified document was discovered in an
unclassified area on June 30.
</P>
<P>
   While some classified work has resumed, most secret operations
at the laboratory remain suspended, and some employees have been
shifted to unclassified work while an investigation is conducted,
the officials said. Managers have been meeting with employees who
work on classified projects ``to reinforce security awareness,''
Greg Koller, a spokesman for the laboratory, said.
</P>
<P>
   The security lapse at Pacific Northwest appears to have been
minor, but officials responded aggressively because it came so soon
after the publicity over lax security at Los Alamos National
Laboratory in New Mexico. At the New Mexico laboratory, two
computer hard drives containing nuclear weapons data disappeared
from a vault this spring, only to reappear behind a copying machine
after the opening of an inquiry by the FBI. Also, Wen Ho Lee, a
former Los Alamos scientist, is awaiting trial on charges that he
downloaded vast amounts of nuclear weapons data from the classified
computer network at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Northwest laboratory is one of nine national
laboratories, but its scientists do not design nuclear weapons.
Instead, the laboratory, which has about 3,500 employees, focuses
on environmental science. Only about 13 percent of its research is
considered classified.
</P>
<P>
   Koller said the classified document was believed to have been
misplaced on June 29 when a laboratory employee copied what he
thought were unclassified drawings, and then placed them in an
office outside the classified area. On June 30, another employee
discovered that one of the drawings was actually classified, and
notified laboratory officials. No one at the laboratory has been
disciplined as a result of the incident, Koller said.

For its ballyhooed coverage of the now-depleted Home Run Derby,
ESPN breaks out a thing called ``true tracker,'' a device that it
claims will precisely measure the distance a ball would travel if
it was unimpeded. ``I love baseball phrases like, `It went a
country mile,' '' ESPN executive producer Jed Drake said. ``We'll
now know just how far a country mile really is.'' Without Mark
McGwire and everyone else, we probably won't. MLB Home Run Derby,
ESPN, 5 p.m.

How convenient for NBC to cross-promote its Sydney Olympics
coverage it's at the centerpiece venue from the `96 Atlanta Games.
Network officials confirm most of this game will be shown live. MLB

Ruben Sierra will make history when he represents the Rangers'
Oklahoma Red Hawks in the Triple-A All-Star Game. The 34-year-old,
hitting .335 with 10 home runs and 46 RBI in 41 games, will be the
first to appear in this game after making a big-league All-Star
Game (he did it four times with Texas in `89, `91, `92 and `94).
Which is probably something you don't want to brag about to the

Net has Friday's game at 7:10 p.m. and Fox Channel 11 has
Saturday's game at 1:05 p.m.) 
FRIDAY 
The only time a women's world record was set at a U.S. Olympic
Trials event was in 1988, when Florence Griffith Joyner ran the 100
in 10.49 - a mark that stands. Since Marion Jones wants to prove
she can be the first to win five golds in track at one Olympics,
she might not go all out in the 100 at this important meet at Cal
State Sacramento, since she also has to run the 200 and compete in
the long jump. She might have to, though. Her qualifying for the
100 and long jump start tonight, with the 100 finals Saturday and
long jump finals Sunday. So her weekend is, yes, pretty full. And
Saturday, her husband, C.J. Hunter, should be involved in the shot
put final. U.S. Olympic track and field trials from Sacramento, Day
1, PAX Channel 30, 8 p.m. (delayed). NBC has Saturday coverage
delayed from 8-9 p.m. and Sunday from 4-6 p.m. 
SATURDAY 
Everyone wants to see heavyweight champ Lennox Lewis face former
heavyweight champ Mike Tyson. Here, you only get half the fun. And
no children eaten. Boxing: Lennox Lewis vs. Frans Botha from
London, HBO, 9 p.m. (delayed) 
SUNDAY 
Since next week's British Open will take a bite out of the field
for the PGA's Greater Milwaukee Open, guys like Duffy Waldorf
should get a pretty decent shot, eh? PGA: Greater Milwaukee Open,
final round, Channel 7, 11 a.m. (ABC has Saturday's third round at
11 a.m.; Fox Sports Net has the first and second rounds Thursday
and Friday at 12:30 p.m.)

ON EVE OF SUMMIT MEETING, RIGHT-WING PARTIES LEAVE BARAK'S
GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (CORRECTS number in possible coalition from 58 to 52 in 6th graf of
2nd take) 
By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak's government disintegrated
Sunday, as one right-leaning party after another quit in protest of
anticipated concessions to the Palestinians, leaving him on
unsteady ground on the eve of his departure to the Camp David
summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring Barak's pleas for unity, three parties, including the
ultra-Orthodox Shas, defected to the previously weak opposition,
upsetting the political balance of power in a single afternoon.
Barak lost his parliamentary majority, and his broad coalition,
which was constructed precisely to build a stable foundation of
support for difficult peace moves, shriveled into a weak
center-left government.
</P>
<P>
   In an address to the nation, Barak defiantly said that the
collapse of his coalition would not affect his trip to Maryland,
which he said was backed by a mandate from the Israelis who elected
him by an overwhelming majority on a peacemaking platform. Barak
asserted that, as a lifelong soldier and fledgling politician, he
had a direct bond with the voters that existed in a kind of
extrapolitical space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Citizens of Israel, approximately one year ago I was elected
by you to be the prime minister of Israel in order to lead the
state of Israel to a safer reality and in order to create a better
future for our children,'' Barak said. ``I did not receive my
mandate from the politicians or from the parties. I received my
mandate from each one of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that by adding new small parties to his government
and relying on the support of Arab parties, Barak could still win a
parliamentary majority for any deal that might be reached at the
summit meeting. But it would not be the ``Jewish majority'' that he
originally sought in hopes of moving toward peace without deepening
divisions that could destabilize not just his government but also
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Barak repeated that he would rely on a popular vote, in the form
of a referendum on an agreement, to try and salve those rifts. And
his office predicted Sunday night that any agreement he achieved at
Camp David would be ratified by a significant popular majority.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine that the new Israeli political reality
will not alter the dynamic of the three-way, retreat-style summit
meeting, where the goal will be to end a 52-year conflict and
resolve the most divisive issues between the Israelis and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But precisely how is uncertain. Palestinian negotiators could
now perceive Barak as a weakened leader unable to deliver on his
promises. While Barak could face a strengthened opposition, he may
also feel free to make concessions without worrying which political
partner he might lose.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Palestinian officials said Sunday night that they
would try and shut out the Israeli political convolutions and,
although they were skeptical even before Sunday's events, focus on
trying to achieve an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Some Palestinian officials also said that they were suspicious
that Barak was engineering his own political difficulties so that
he could hide behind them at the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the first time that we have witnessed such a show on
the stage of Ehud Barak,'' said Abdul Ahmed Rahman, the secretary
general of the Palestinian Cabinet. ``This is not credible. If
Barak thinks that he can manufacture the impression that he is
restricted, well, such maneuvers will be transparent to the
Americans as well as to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Kicking off the snowballing dynamic of the day, Foreign Minister
David Levy told Barak Sunday morning that, in protest at what he
labeled the Palestinians' hard-line positions and threats of
violence, he would not join the delegation traveling to Camp David.
He did not speak publicly about his decision, but associates said
that he was pessimistic that anything would come of the high-level
talks, which are supposed to start on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Yaron Dekel said he saw this as ``a slap in
the face'' to Barak and a no-confidence vote in Barak's policy.
</P>
<P>
   Then Interior Minister Natan Sharansky, leader of a small
Russian immigrant party, resigned, saying that Barak had
obstinately refused to divulge his positions in advance and to
build the internal support needed for what could be difficult
concessions ahead. Sharansky had been pushing Barak to form a unity
government with the rightist Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are arriving at the summit in the United States weakened,
without red lines, without the support of the government and
without the support of most of the people,'' Sharansky wrote in his
resignation letter to Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under these conditions,'' he continued, ``the agreement that
you will be able to reach is dangerous from a diplomatic point of
view and has the potential to cause a split in the people, a split
from which, God forbid, there will be no turning back.''
</P>
<P>
   Several hours later, the Shas party, whose balkiness has
unsettled the government since it took office last July, finally
walked out for good.
</P>
<P>
   Shas is a religious party that doubles as an ethnic pride
movement for working class Jews of Middle Eastern origin. In its
routine threats to quit, it was perceived to be maneuvering for its
party's interests, particularly the financial health and
independence of its religious school system. If Shas was satisfied,
the common wisdom said, Shas would support peacemaking based on its
spiritual leader's religious ruling that territory could be
conceded if lives would be saved as a result.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts repeatedly predicted that Shas, whose constituency
leans to the right, would get the jitters when a crucial moment
arrived. Indeed, by day's end, when it became clear that it would
be the only right-leaning party left in the government, Shas made
the decision to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shas entered the coalition because the peace process is very
important to us and we would have expected to have been genuine
partners,'' said Eli Yishai, Shas' political leader. ``But to be
partners on the road taken one needs to know the road. And we
don't. We don't know Barak's red lines. The red lines that he
demarcated and presented to the people are obscure and unclear.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's office, in a statement, countered that his red lines _
which the Palestinians regularly and glumly cite as evidence that
an agreement will be difficult to achieve _ have been well-known
since his campaign. The statement said that revealing them in
greater detail would weaken Israel's negotiating position.
</P>
<P>
   The statement reiterated Barak's absolutes: no return to 1967
borders, ``a united Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty, no foreign
army west of the Jordan River, a majority of the Jewish settlers
will remain in settlement blocs and no Israeli recognition of legal
or moral responsibility for creating the refugee problem.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the leftist Meretz Party, who recently resigned
their Cabinet positions so that Shas would stay in the government,
were furious. ``All through the years we heard of the moderate
stand taken by Shas because Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, their leader, he
puts foremost the saving of lives _ that saving lives is more
important than territories,'' said Ran Cohen, the former Trade
Minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Barak comes along and with tweezers goes over every
detail, every settlement, every road, every section, measures
exactly as possible in order to save lives, to prevent returning to
the killing of Jews and Arabs in a continuation of 100 years of
war, and the Shas people, the moment they stand before the most
important diplomatic, ideological, test of principle, they say they
are about to quit? For what? Do they want to return to the
intifada?''
</P>
<P>
   The National Religious Party, which represents religious
Zionists and the settlers, also said that its central committee had
voted unanimously to pull out of the government.
</P>
<P>
   All three parties that quit were part of the rightist government
of former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which fell after
Netanyahu concluded an interim peace agreement with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Barak faces a no-confidence motion in his government on Monday,
which was submitted by the Likud party on the basis of his supposed
``capitulation'' to Arafat. Analysts predict that Barak will
survive it, but his office said Sunday night that he had changed
his travel plans to return to Israel from a trip to Egypt on Monday
so that he could be present in the parliament later in the day.
Then he will proceed to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The parties' resignations will reduce Barak to a 42-member
government in a 120-member parliament. He could bulk up to a
heftier minority government of 52 members by pulling in three other
small parties: a small, liberal Russian immigrant faction, a
secularist party and a trade unionists' party.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be an unstable political base for running the
government, and it remains to be seen how Barak will handle either
a success or failure at Camp David. Political analysts consider new
elections likely.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As a leader routinely accused of haughtiness and autocratic
behavior, Barak's bid to ignore the political system and appeal
directly to the people is a risky one. ``Had I been forced to
listen to all the prophets of doom _ the very same prophets who are
now speaking at large _ I suppose that our children would still be
in the Lebanese mud,'' he said, referring to those who predicted
that the Israeli troop withdrawal from southern Lebanon in May
would lead to war. ``No one will teach me what security is.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``I have to rise above all of the political
disputes and above all party considerations and exhaust all of the
possibilities on the way to a peace agreement that will put an end
to the bloody conflict between us and our neighbors. Put an end to
it at the negotiation table and not in the battlefields and in
terror stricken streets.''

CLINTON STRESSES THE ECONOMY IN HER UPSTATE CAMPAIGN SWING 
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UTICA, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton continued her emphasis on
economic issues Sunday, renewing her call for the Federal Trade
Commission to broaden its investigation of sharply increased
gasoline prices and urging Congress to pass legislation to create
an oil reserve for states in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth day of her Senate campaign tour through upstate
New York, Clinton rejected as ``a serious error'' any move to
eliminate the gasoline tax, a proposal advocated by her Republican
rival, Rep. Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reject my opponent's proposal of eliminating the gas tax,''
Clinton said at a news conference in Rochester. ``One of the few
sources of revenue that we actually get more of than we send to
Washington is gas tax money for our transportation needs. It would
be hard to imagine how upstate can finish all the work we need to
do without the federal help that comes from transportation
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   On the investigation into gasoline prices, Clinton said that it
was imperative for the commission to ``go beyond where it has
already begun to try to figure out why, while fuel costs have gone
up over 50 cents in New York, profits for major oil companies have
gone up more than 500 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   In the tour, which is covering a dozen communities across the
state's western, Southern Tier and Finger Lake regions, Clinton has
sought to discuss policies that would affect the troubled economy
of upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   While her campaign has called this trip the ``Upstate Economic
Tour,'' it has in fact been more of a cookout and picnic tour.
Clinton has appeared at several picnics and rallies sponsored by
the Democratic Party in a number if upstate counties. Sunday
afternoon, in Van Buren, N.Y., she spoke at a cookout organized by
party officials of Cayuga, Oswego and Onondaga counties. At a
similar event in Utica Sunday evening, she spoke to a gathering of
more than 500 Democrats and union members from four counties. After
the audience's enthusiastic greeting, Clinton spoke about the need
to lower utility costs, to stimulate job growth and to rehabilitate
the roads and highways in this region.
</P>
<P>
   In speaking with voters at the picnics and other events, as in
previous visits to this region of the state, Clinton has been asked
most frequently about her ideas and proposals to revive the economy
in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began the day at the Mount Olivet Baptist Church in
Rochester. It had not been announced in advance to members of the
church that Clinton would be worshipping there, and her presence
seem to take nearly everyone by surprise. Seated beside William A.
Johnson Jr., the mayor of Rochester, Clinton swayed and clapped to
the music by the choir.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand here today before you today to thank those of you who
prayed for me and my husband,'' Clinton said, standing in the
sanctuary of the church and addressing an enthusiastic
congregation. ``I believe that we were both sustained and uplifted
because of prayer. And so I thank you and ask you not to quit
yet.''

MIT MISSILE EXPERT CHALLENGES PENTAGON TO BUILD MISSILE DEFENSE
THAT WORKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The left lens of his eyeglasses is missing. The
pocket of his multicolored sports shirt bulges with plastic rulers
and scraps of paper. And his rolling suitcase holds more charts and
manuals than clean shirts and toiletries.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Postol knows how to play the role of the rocket
scientist that he is. He also knows how to infuriate Washington's
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Postol, a big, bearded 54-year-old physicist at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has combined evidence,
emotion and expletives in his crusade to prove that a proposed $60
billion missile shield for the United States is based on faulty
science, fantasy and outright fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon insists that his assertions are based on outdated
information and ignorance of classified materials. But Postol's
scientist friends insist that he is one of the country's most
learned ballistic missile experts and credit his research group at
MIT with ground-breaking analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even his closest colleagues acknowledge that Postol
suffers from a problem that has little to do with science and a lot
to do with style. As a scientist, he brings laserlike precision to
his work. But as a diplomat, he has all the subtlety of a Gatling
gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a weapons system that is supposed to protect our
families from nuclear attack, and these guys at the Pentagon are
lying about its performance,'' Postol said during a visit to
Washington last week. ``They know nothing, nothing. But they wrap
themselves in the flag and point at me and say, `You're not
defending the country.' So I don't care who I offend.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in Postol's view, Secretary of Defense William Cohen and
Lt. Gen. Ronald Kadish, the head of the Pentagon's ballistic
missile office, are ``technically illiterate'' about missile
defense. Condoleezza Rice, the chief foreign policy adviser for
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, is ``not interested in the truth.''
Leon Fuerth, the national security adviser for Vice President Al
Gore, is ``uninformed and shows no interest in becoming informed.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Garwin, a renowned physicist known for being politically
independent and outspoken himself, said of Postol: ``Ted is a
sound, original and energetic scientist who has done great work in
this field. But diplomacy and Ted Postol are an oxymoron. Many,
many times I have told him, `You will be more effective if you are
more controlled and edit your language.'''
</P>
<P>
   Postol noted what his good friend had said and explained: ``I
don't insult people for the hell of it. I am a very polite person
with people on the street, with taxi drivers. But if you talk about
people with responsibility in government and they show no interest
in the truth, I'm not going to say, `They're nice people but they
don't know the details.'''
</P>
<P>
   The second of three children, Postol grew up in a decaying
neighborhood of Jewish immigrants in the Coney Island section of
Brooklyn, N.Y. His father, a welder, beat him from the time he was
a toddler, Postol said; his mother, who worked in an Army data
communications center, was ``a genius who basically lived for her
children,'' Postol said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was not interested in the basics of elementary
education and had trouble reading, Postol recalled, he began
building spaceships in kindergarten. ``When the teacher asked me
what I wanted to do with my life, I said, `I want to study the
stars.'''
</P>
<P>
   Postol discovered physics as an undergraduate and then a
graduate student at the institute, which he attended on
scholarship. ``I was blessed with a tremendous physical
intuition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Exempted from the draft because of an eye ailment, Postol stayed
away from protests of the Vietnam War. Seminars by teachers who had
helped build the atomic bomb made him a passionate critic of
nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   But he has not always been an outsider. He worked in the 1970s
at an Energy Department nuclear lab, then co-wrote a study on MX
missile basing for the Congressional Office of Technology
Assessment. He studied submarine warfare from 1983 to 1984 for the
chief of naval operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working in the Pentagon turned out to be one of the best
decisions of my life,'' he said. ``The sky was the limit. I could
pretty much get into everything. I could learn whatever I wanted
about nuclear war plans, ballistic missiles, early warning.''
</P>
<P>
   Postol also learned to respect the military, he said. ``The
military officer would never abandon the battlefield without taking
his wounded with him. The academic would say, `You're on your
own.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the high-tech world, he is a rare bird: an institute
professor with no outside consulting income. ``I have a rich
wife,'' he joked, referring to the woman with whom he has lived for
17 years, a senior official at an investment company. They have
never married and have no children.
</P>
<P>
   Postol has angered the Pentagon many times before, most
dramatically when he successfully challenged the ``success'' of the
Patriot missile in shooting down Iraqi missiles in the Persian Gulf
war. But he still holds security clearances that give him access to
classified material. (``I don't use them anyway,'' he said.
``They're useless.'')
</P>
<P>
   And despite his opposition to the missile defense plan, he said
that if the United States was determined to build it, he would help
develop what he believes is a more feasible approach: a boost-phase
technology that would shoot at enemy missiles in the first few
minutes after launching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like missile defense,'' he said, ``but if we have to
have it, let's have a system that works.''

 &HT;    Sampras with his seventh Wimbledon title
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ When the match ended three minutes before 9
p.m., they still sat virtually anonymous in the deeply shadowed top
rows of Centre Court.
</P>
<P>
   Sam and Georgia Sampras stood and watched their youngest son
soak in all the emotion of the moment: the flash bulbs shimmering
in pale purple dusk, the American flag waving, the nearly 14,000
fans applauding his history-making performance, the joy and the
tears on their 28-year-old boy's face.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Sampras had just survived a painful leg injury, terrible
nerves and four hours of rain delays to win a record-tying seventh
Wimbledon title Sunday and become the first man to win 13 Grand
Slams in his career, breaking Australian Roy Emerson's record of
12.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is amazing how this tournament just panned out for
me,'' Sampras said. ``I didn't really feel like I was going to win
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Rafter fought hard to protect his fellow Australian's
record, coming within three points of a two-set lead, but
ultimately got overwhelmed. Sampras hit a 122-mph service winner to
clinch the match 6-7 (10-12), 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 6-2 after two hours,
57 minutes of play.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras threw his arms into the air, then bent over and rested
his elbows on his knees as he cried. He stood and wiped his eyes on
his shirt and waved to his coach, friends and fiancee in the
stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great moment,'' Sampras said. ``It was an amazing
setting because it was getting dark, the flashes, the roar of the
crowd. (It) was a moment that I'll never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   For a few seconds, he wandered the court, taking it all in
almost in disbelief. Then he looked toward the Friends Box.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all pointing to my parents, that I should go up
there,'' he said. ``It took me a while to find them. They were up
in the rafters.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't because he couldn't get them better seats. That was
because they prefer the background. He had to speak firmly to
convince them to fly from their Los Angeles-area home to London
even for this match.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the second Grand Slam final they'd ever seen him
play in person. The first was the 1992 U.S. Open he lost to Stefan
Edberg. But his absence doesn't mean they've been absent from his
career.
</P>
<P>
   His parents introduced him to tennis when he was 7, ferried him
to lessons and tournaments as a child and endured the many hours he
hogged the television to watch tapes of idol Rod Laver's matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've always kept their distance,'' Sampras said. ``They
supported, did what parents do. They just love you.''
</P>
<P>
   And after he turned pro at 17, they let him go and gave him his
``space.'' He even moved to Florida for many years before returning
to Southern California last year because he wanted to be closer,
finding family more important as he gets older.
</P>
<P>
   But like most parents, they still find watching so difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get very nervous,'' Sampras said. ``Not just that, but
being superstitious, they are very shy people. They don't want to
be on camera.''
</P>
<P>
   The cameras found them Sunday, although they declined to talk to
reporters. A BBC commentator even pointed out Sam Sampras in a
crowded shot as ``the man with the eyebrows.'' And once Sampras
found his parents, he made a deliberate climb up 20 rows into the
stands to hug them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to share it with my parents,'' he said. ``I've
wanted them to be a part of it. They gave me a chance to play this
great game.''
</P>
<P>
   But for most of the match, the tennis took precedence over the
parents. Rafter's also flew in, from Australia, for the final.
</P>
<P>
   When they took the court an hour late, both players started well
but Sampras dominated on his serve. Two rain delays later, the
first tiebreaker began. Sampras had two set points before Rafter
won it on his third chance -- when Sampras double faulted.
</P>
<P>
   The second set was similar, with no breaks of serve, and Sampras
started the second tiebreaker the same way he ended the first one:
with a doublefault. Rafter built that into a 4-1 lead, which he
celebrated with a fist pump, when Sampras lofted a forehand volley
long despite a wide open court.
</P>
<P>
   But then Rafter netted a volley, double faulted and hit a short
forehand passing shot into the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, I knew I was screwed,'' Rafter said. ``Then I just
thought, 'Oh God, this is really going downhill.' I was really
going to find it hard to deal with the nerves. That was a mental
blow more than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   And a lift for a worried Sampras. He won the second set four
points later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really felt like it was slipping away,'' he said. ``(I went)
from feeling like I was going to lose the match (to) I felt like I
was going to win the match within two minutes. That's grass-court
tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, darkness loomed. Neither player felt bothered or
rushed, but they knew time was limited. Sampras converted his first
of 10 break points in the fifth game for a 3-2 lead and Rafter
unraveled from there.
</P>
<P>
   In Sampras' first-ever speech to the crowd, he choked up when he
thanked fans for their devotion to him on ``the best court in the
world.'' He owns seven titles and 59-5 record at Wimbledon. Only
William Renshaw, father of grass-court tennis, earned as many
trophies, but his record is just 22-3 because in the 1880s,
defending champions played only the final.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras also added about $700,000 to his $39.5 million in career
earnings with the victory and joined a list of just five others to
win four consecutive Wimbledon titles.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson, who won his 12th Grand Slam at the 1967 French Open,
planned to watch the match at his tennis camp in Switzerland. Since
Sampras moved within two of his 12 at Wimbledon 1998, ``Emmo'' has
remained gracious in saying he hates to see a record go, but
Sampras is a good man to have it.
</P>
<P>
   For Sampras, the record means a lot, especially after he
developed severe tendinitis and inflammation of his left shin
during his second-round match. He would have withdrawn from any
other tournament, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never, ever planned on ever breaking this record,'' Sampras
said. ``It's kind of transcended into something that I put myself
in a position to do. It hasn't hit me. It won't hit me for
months.''
</P>
<P>
   But what next, what more for this player?
</P>
<P>
   Sampras already has scaled back his schedule to concentrate on
the major tournaments. Perhaps he'll seek a 14th Grand Slam. He's
added Davis Cup as a priority this year but admits his injury might
hamper him if he joins the U.S. team to play Spain later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter said the French Open is the only glaring hole on a
stellar resume for the position of all-time greatest player.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Pete's last big challenge,'' Rafter said. ``Like all
great champions, I think you've got to win on all surfaces in
majors. Pete, in my eyes, still goes down as the greatest player
ever. It would just be something that would really concrete it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras admitted the same but won't start working out for the
clay season just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an achievement standpoint, I've done what I've wanted to
do,'' he said. ``It's time to sit back and soak this up, not really
worry about what's next, just reflect on these last two weeks.''

WITH OPPOSITION ABSTAINING, MOST HAITIANS IGNORE RUNOFF ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-MARC, Haiti _ In a runoff election shunned by opposition
candidates and international observers, a handful of Haitians voted
Sunday for the few legislative and local offices that were not
already won by Lavalas bloc, the party of former President
Jean-Bertrand Aristede.
</P>
<P>
   The low turnout came after opposition parties and international
groups protested questionable first-round results on May 21, which
they said relied on an inaccurate vote count that gave outright
victories to many Lavalas candidates, including 18 of 19 Senate
seats. When Haitian officials refused to reconsider requests that
eight of those seats be determined in a runoff, opposition parties
and observer groups refused to take part.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not think they should allow the process to go forward as
if nothing had happened,'' Orlando Marville, the leader of the
Organization of American States electoral mission, said on Friday.
``Fundamentally, if they say they are not going to change it, we
cannot accept it as valid. This changes the whole nature of the
elections. We are at the position where to observe the elections
would send the wrong signal, which we do not want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the first round, when thousands of voters lined up for
hours, Sunday's election held little excitement or suspense. In
many cities, including Port-au-Prince, the capital, there were no
runoff elections because all races had been decided, in the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, people assumed Lavalas would continue its sweep. In
Saint-Marc, polling station workers spent the early morning dozing
in the shade while waiting for voters to trickle in. Many residents
of this town two hours north of Port-au-Prince said they were not
bothering to take part because they felt the process had been set
up to favor Lavalas.
</P>
<P>
   ``What election?'' said Marcial D'Orleans, an undertaker who
spent the morning with some friends sitting in the plaza outside
city hall. ``People heard on television and radio that the first
round was a mess. Only one party won. So people decided not to vote
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The elections represented a crucial step in restoring a
functioning government to Haiti, which has not had a Parliament
since early 1999. About $500 million in international aid had been
blocked because there was no legislature to pass authorizations to
rebuild roads or other crumbling public works.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was also a test of the drawing power of Aristede, who
was barred by law for running for a second consecutive term in the
last election but is expected to run again for president in
November without any significant opposition. His party's sweep of
not only the legislature, but also mayoralties and other local
offices in Haiti's biggest cities, would prevent his administration
from being mired in the legislative and political challenges that
have crippled the current government of his protege, President Rene
Preval.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected president, was
ousted in a military coup seven months after he took office in 1991
and was restored to power by an American-led invasion force in
1994. He remains the country's most popular politician.
</P>
<P>
   More than 29,000 candidates and 60 percent of the nation's 4
million voters took part in the first round, and international
observers said there had been no gross irregularities in the
voting. Observers said many voters had chosen Lavalas, which had
mounted an aggressive campaign urging people to vote for all the
candidates of their party.
</P>
<P>
   But soon after the polls closed, opposition candidates
complained that armed groups linked to Lavalas had burst into some
polling places and intimidated workers or made off with ballot
boxes. The next day, about 30 opposition party members were
arrested by the police on charges of inciting to riot or disturbing
the peace with their claims of fraud. The charges were later
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis continued when the Provisional Electoral Council
released partial results that gave Lavalas 18 of the 19 Senate
seats at stake. Leon Manus, the council president, refused to sign
off on those results and fled the country, saying he feared for his
life. He said he had been under extreme pressure to confirm the
results, which had been determined by counting only the votes
received by the top four candidates for each post.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Haitian people turned out in large numbers because they
believed in the process, and that was encouraging,'' said one
Haitian who was an observer during the first round. ``What is
discouraging is they were told their gesture did not count.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavalas supporters, however, said the charges were being fueled
by opposition candidates who did have enough support to win at the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lavalas is strong here,'' said Charles Deceres, a Lavalas
supporter in St. Marc. ``Manus resigned because the other parties
insisted they had people behind them, but they were wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerard Pierre Charles, the leader of the Organization of People
in Struggle, a Lavalas splinter group that had led the legislative
opposition, said the government's refusal to let the contested
seats be determined in a runoff was but the latest outrage in an
electoral process that had been dominated by Lavalas. He said their
supporters held many posts at polling places and had often taken to
the streets in turbulent protests after the first round where they
blocked traffic, burned tires and promised to disrupt the country
if their party did not win.
</P>
<P>
   ``A positive aspect of this is it helped put clearly the
antidemocratic project of Aristede,'' Pierre Charles said. ``These
were not elections, this was a hidden coup. This electoral parody
brings about an absolute control of the state. So we fall into a
totalitarian government with one party rule.''
</P>
<P>
   That prospect worried some residents of St. Marc, even as they
sat out the elections. ``If the problems continue, we will take a
boat to Miami,'' said Jean Eric, a mason. ``Here there is only one
group eating all the food. Lavalas.''

 &HT;    EDS: Fix in hed
 &HT;    Sampras wins his seventh Wimbledon title
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ When the match ended three minutes before 9
p.m., they still sat virtually anonymous in the deeply shadowed top
rows of Centre Court.
</P>
<P>
   Sam and Georgia Sampras stood and watched their youngest son
soak in all the emotion of the moment: the flash bulbs shimmering
in pale purple dusk, the American flag waving, the nearly 14,000
fans applauding his history-making performance, the joy and the
tears on their 28-year-old boy's face.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Sampras had just survived a painful leg injury, terrible
nerves and four hours of rain delays to win a record-tying seventh
Wimbledon title Sunday and become the first man to win 13 Grand
Slams in his career, breaking Australian Roy Emerson's record of
12.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is amazing how this tournament just panned out for
me,'' Sampras said. ``I didn't really feel like I was going to win
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Rafter fought hard to protect his fellow Australian's
record, coming within three points of a two-set lead, but
ultimately got overwhelmed. Sampras hit a 122-mph service winner to
clinch the match 6-7 (10-12), 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 6-2 after two hours,
57 minutes of play.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras threw his arms into the air, then bent over and rested
his elbows on his knees as he cried. He stood and wiped his eyes on
his shirt and waved to his coach, friends and fiancee in the
stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great moment,'' Sampras said. ``It was an amazing
setting because it was getting dark, the flashes, the roar of the
crowd. (It) was a moment that I'll never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   For a few seconds, he wandered the court, taking it all in

   ``They're all pointing to my parents, that I should go up

   It was only the second Grand Slam final they'd ever seen him

GOVERNORS MEET BUT ARE DIVIDED BY POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.D., Ky., N.C., Md., Del.)   By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. _ Republican governors outnumber Democrats
almost 2-1, and they were a confident, even cocky, bunch as they
descended on this university town in central Pennsylvania for the
92nd annual meeting of the National Governors' Association.
</P>
<P>
   One of their own _ George W. Bush of Texas _ was a shoo-in to
win this year's presidential race, they boasted at every
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   And, they predicted, Republicans would hold onto Congress and
win most, maybe even all, of the 11 governorships that are up for
grabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could hardly feel better about the way things are going,''
said Gov. Edward Schafer of North Dakota, chairman of the
Republican Governors' Association.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, not to be outdone, insisted that Vice President
Al Gore would turn things around once the summer nominating
conventions were over and voters focused on the fall election.
``We're extremely optimistic,'' said Gov. Paul Patton of Kentucky,
chairman of the Democratic Governors' Association. ``We're looking
to majority Democratic leadership in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   So confident was the Bush campaign that it did not send an envoy
to brief the Republicans here _ neither Bush nor his brother Jeb,
the governor of Florida, made an appearance. But Gore sent William
Daley, his campaign manager, to reassure and assuage the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Daley met privately with the Democratic governors. No sooner had
he gone than both Republicans and Democrats scheduled news
conferences, events that were so politically partisan that they
totally submerged what was meant to be the main business of the
meeting _ a four-day, nonpartisan discussion about ``strengthening
the American states in the new global economy.''
</P>
<P>
   There was instead endless speculation about whether any of the
40 or so governors present might end up as vice presidential
choices. No fewer than eight had been mentioned as possible
candidates and just as the dueling news conferences by the
Democratic and Republican governors' groups overshadowed the
convention, so did the vice presidential stir, which also had its
moments of one-upmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Schafer was asked whether the stir was causing tension among the
governors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What tension?'' replied Schafer, who is not the subject of any
serious speculation about vice presidential candidates. ``I haven't
noticed any tension. I don't see them in any competition.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Patton, Daley exuded confidence during the briefing
of Democratic governors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very, very upbeat,'' Patton said. ``He said that this
race would turn around as soon as people began focusing on it,
after the conventions. They're not doing that now.''
</P>
<P>
   Why would the focus after the conventions improve Gore's
standing with voters, since nine out of 10 national polls have had
him trailing Bush by five to 10 points for several months?
</P>
<P>
   Because, Patton replied, other polls indicated that on most
major social and economic issues, a majority of voters favored the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters are with us,'' he said, ``and when people focus on
what they want, Al Gore will win.''
</P>
<P>
   Did the Democratic governors, by predicting a postconvention
collapse of the Bush campaign, see a parallel with the 1988
campaign of Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts? Dukakis, a
Democrat, led Bush's father by a substantial margin for months but
lost after the nominating conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't necessarily say that,'' replied Gov. James Hunt of
North Carolina, a Democrat. ``What I do say is that when people
finally focus on what counts and what they want, Al Gore will be
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Parris Glendening of Maryland, a Democrat, argued that Gore
would win not just because of his stand on issues but also because
he was a ``proven leader,'' experienced at the highest level in
handling both domestic and foreign issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrast that to the less than stellar performance and
experience of George W. Bush,'' Glendening said.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any anti-Bush argument that the Democrats presented
here that hit home with the Republicans, the assertion that Bush
was not up to handling the White House job was it. They devoted
most of an hourlong press conference to arguing otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, prominently mentioned as a
possible Bush choice for vice president, said that Bush qualified
as an experienced leader because he had served as chief executive
of one of the nation's largest states and understood how to
``practice the politics of what works.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not understand that governing principle, Ridge added,
because he had never been in an executive position. Rather, argued
Ridge, Gore saw governing as a you're-for-us-or-against-us
proposition.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On the issue of supplying pharmaceuticals to the elderly and
poor, Ridge said, Gore saw it as ``you're either for the drug
companies or for senior citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You should try to get people together,'' Ridge said. ``The
politicization of that issue is not how to get things done.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the governors managed to break free of partisan
politicking for an hour or so to hear Colin Powell discuss programs
that they might put in place to help the nation's young people, a
cause he has been promoting since he retired from the U.S. Army.
But in the end, the talk came around to politics.
</P>
<P>
   First, the general was asked again whether he would accept an
offer to be Bush's vice presidential candidate, or maybe run for
president himself at some point, given his popularity not only with
Republicans but also with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   No, Powell replied, as he has been replying for months. But some
day, he went on, he might accept an appointive job in the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just as the general was preparing to depart the convention
hall, Gov. Thomas Carper of Delaware had a word with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to think you'd make a good president,'' Carper said.
``Now I know you would.''
</P>
<P>
   Carper is a Democrat.

DEBATE OVER TAX CUTS IS SHIFTING TO SPECIFICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Rewrites story from 2nd graf to graf that begins ``There is a
changing ....'' And changes ``he said'' to ``Schmelzer said'' in

By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With projections of the federal budget surplus
rising and both parties in full election-year mode, the debate over
tax cuts is shifting from whether to what kinds.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans continue to press for bigger reductions than most
Democrats will support, and there is unlikely to be any legislative
breakthrough this year.
</P>
<P>
   But in Washington and on the campaign trail, Democrats from
President Clinton on down are joining Republicans in backing tax
cuts _ enthusiastically in some cases, grudgingly and with
conditions in others _ to a far greater degree than they were a
year or even six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the clearest signs of shifting sentiment, nearly a
third of the Democrats in the House broke ranks with the party last
month and voted to repeal the federal estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore doubled his proposed tax-cutting package
a few weeks ago, to $500 billion over 10 years, moving him closer
to the $1.3 trillion plan offered by his Republican rival for the
presidency, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton announced recently that he would agree to a $250
billion, 10-year tax cut for married couples on Republican terms if
Congress would pass his plan to add prescription-drug coverage to
the Medicare system of health insurance for the elderly and
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The new political dynamics will be on display in Congress this
week when the Senate takes up the two big tax-cutting bills of the
year: the repeal of the federal estate tax, and the reduction of
taxes on nearly all married couples in the name of eliminating the
``marriage penalty,'' the quirk in the tax code that leaves some
two-income couples paying a bigger tax bill than they would if they
had remained single.
</P>
<P>
   On the estate-tax repeal, the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott
of Mississippi, said he was hopeful that he might be able to
attract enough support from Democrats to overcome procedural
hurdles and force a final vote on the bill this week.
</P>
<P>
   If they can get past those hurdles, Republicans are all but
assured of passing the bill. Repealing the estate tax has long been
one of the Republicans' priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate legislation, identical with the version passed by the
House, would gradually reduce and eventually eliminate the tax,
which applies only to estates valued at $675,000 or more, a
threshold that is already scheduled to rise to $1 million by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has made clear that Clinton would veto the bill.
But Republicans say just passing the legislation with bipartisan
support would be a powerful political symbol of opposition to the
tax, and they have not ruled out bringing the bill up again as part
of an end-of-the-year budget package.
</P>
<P>
   For years it was Democratic orthodoxy to label repeal of the
estate tax a giveaway to the very richest people in the country.
But to try to reduce defections from their ranks and display their
own tax-cutting credentials, Democrats in the Senate are planning
to offer a less expensive alternative proposal on the estate tax,
as their counterparts in the House did last month. The Democratic
proposal is expected to call for the effective elimination of the
tax for two politically powerful constituencies that say they are
hard hit by it _ owners of small businesses and family farms _ but
to continue to impose the tax at reduced rates on the very largest
estates.
</P>
<P>
   Lott also plans to bring up the marriage-penalty bill by the end
of the week under a procedure that would keep Democrats from
stalling the bill or loading it with amendments.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which would cut taxes on married couples by $248
billion over 10 years, is larger than a version passed this year by
the House. As with the estate tax, Democrats plan to offer a less
expensive alternative. They would seek to eliminate the marriage
penalty without giving a tax cut to couples who already receive a
marriage bonus _ that is, a lower tax bill than they would pay if
they had remained single.
</P>
<P>
   Since Republicans have shown no signs of accepting his proposal
to swap a tax cut for the prescription-drug coverage plan, Clinton
is likely to veto the marriage-penalty bill if it passes. But
Republicans said that they would nonetheless be able to go to their
party convention at the end of the month and tell voters they had
done their part to enact big tax cuts, and that it was a Democrat
in the White House who had blocked them.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say the two parties will remain stalemated on
fiscal policy as long as control of Congress and the White House
remains divided. Others are more optimistic about a compromise on
tax cuts, perhaps even this year, because there is enough money for
both parties to get what they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a question of horse trading at this point,'' said
Bruce Bartlett, a fellow at the National Center for Policy
Analysis, a conservative research group.
</P>
<P>
   But the supercharged politics of the campaign season will make
it difficult for any tax cuts to be enacted before a new president
and Congress take office next year.
</P>
<P>
   The muddled outlook reflects in part the uncertainty in both
parties about how much demand there is among voters for tax cuts.
And the evolving politics of tax cuts are just one illustration of
how the quickly increasing surplus projections are forcing both
parties to rethink their ideology and tactics on fiscal issues.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the White House increased its estimate of the total
budget surplus for the next 10 years by nearly $1.3 trillion, to
$4.2 trillion. Long-term budget forecasts are notoriously
unreliable, and the fiscal outlook could change substantially based
on how the economy performs.
</P>
<P>
   The two parties have agreed not to use the portion of the
surplus generated by Social Security _ $2.3 trillion over the next
decade _ for tax cuts or general spending. But that still leaves a
projected windfall of $1.9 trillion on the table, and just as
Democrats are becoming more open to tax cuts, Republicans are
proving more willing to go along with expanding government
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a changing climate on tax cuts,'' said Sen. William
Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Finance Committee. Roth said that the
larger surplus projections, the possibility that the long economic
expansion might be starting to run out of steam, and Clinton's
willingness to negotiate a deal have combined to give tax
reductions new political viability.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also said the rosier fiscal outlook has made tax
cutting more appealing _ or at least made it more difficult
politically to reject all tax cuts out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   But they said tax cuts are getting more bipartisan consideration
because Republicans in Congress have dropped their insistence on
putting forward all-encompassing tax-reduction bills that would use
all or most of the projected surpluses and instead are addressing
specific types of tax cuts one by one.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats generally remain solidly opposed to broad-based
tax-cutting packages of the type proposed by Bush in his
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats have always been willing to consider if not support
tax cuts that are fair, while reflecting our priorities and the
need for sound fiscal management of the surplus,'' said Gene
Sperling, the director of the White House's National Economic
Council.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``What has changed is that instead of the Republicans in
Congress offering a single, excessive tax-cut package that could be
rejected immediately as breaking the bank,'' he said, ``they are
now trying to slice their tax agenda into smaller pieces, which can
be individually considered on the basis of fairness, fiscal
prudence and priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   In the coming week, Democrats plan to hit the Republicans hard
on those points, asserting that the Republican versions of the
estate-tax and marriage-penalty bills are much too expensive and
too tilted to the wealthy. And they intend to make a case that tax
cuts are justifiable only after the two parties agree on more
pressing issues, in particular adding prescription-drug coverage to
Medicare and allocating more of the surplus to reducing the
national debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats believe you can eliminate the marriage penalty and
reduce the estate tax, and at the same time provide Americans with
a prescription-drug benefit,'' said Ranit Schmelzer, communications
director for Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic
leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans just want to do the tax cut,'' Schmelzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Roth said that Republicans, too, think there is enough money for
a sizable tax cut, a prescription-drug benefit and steady reduction
of the national debt. And he said that as he travels through his
home state, he finds considerable support among voters for acting
now to repeal the estate tax and cut taxes on couples.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are banking on getting support from Democrats who
are up for re-election this year and do not want to have to explain
their opposition to tax cuts. They point to Democrats like Sen.
Charles Robb of Virginia, who is in a tough race this year in an
anti-tax state and supports repeal of the estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans acknowledge that their party also needs to
be willing to compromise if it wants Clinton to sign any tax cuts
into law, and that if they play politics with the issue they will
be exposed to assertions by Democrats that Republicans have run a
do-nothing Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a strong believer that what people back home want to see
at election time is what you've accomplished,'' said Roth, who is
also locked in a tight re-election race. ``There are some on both
sides who want an issue, not legislation, but I think that's
short-sighted.''

<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ Opening the first international
conference on AIDS in a developing country, South African President
Thabo Mbeki Sunday singled out extreme poverty, rather than the
disease ravaging his country and continent, as the leading killer
both here and across Africa.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa is the country with the largest number of people
infected with HIV, the AIDS virus _ 4.2 million _ and its
president, who has become embroiled in international controversy
over the causes of the disease, pledged to intensify his response.
But he dashed the hopes of thousands of participants _ and noisy
protesters _ who wanted to hear him state clearly that HIV causes
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Mbeki skirted the controversy that has arisen because
he has questioned the use of certain drugs in treating HIV, and has
even questioned whether the virus causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   As Mbeki described his attempts to understand how one of the
worst epidemics in history has enveloped his country just as it
freed itself from apartheid, he reflected on AIDS and a long list
of other diseases afflicting his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I listened and heard the whole story told about our own
country, it seemed to me that we could not blame everything on a
single virus,'' Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
   The 13th international conference on AIDS is being held as U.N.
officials have been intensifying the alarm about HIV, which infects
34.3 million people in the world, mostly in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after Mbeki finished talking, Dr. Peter Piot, the head
of UNAIDS, a U.N. program that monitors the spread of AIDS, said it
will take at least $3 billion a year to deliver the basic measures
in Africa and tens of billions of dollars more each year to provide
in Africa the standard drugs used to treat the disease in developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The $3 billion figure is ten times what is now being spent in
Africa, Piot said. UNAIDS estimates that 90 percent of people with
HIV do not know they are infected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need billions, not millions, to fight AIDS in the world,''
and ``we can't fight an epidemic of this magnitude with peanuts,''
Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   In news conferences and interviews, Piot said he welcomed a
pledge of $500 million from the World Bank this weekend as a
positive step. He said the remainder needs to come from the
affected African countries and the developed countries.
</P>
<P>
   Piot urged developed countries to cancel the $15 billion in debt
repayment that African countries have incurred each year and return
it so countries can use the money for health care and social
services for AIDS and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   But political will is as important as money in stopping the AIDS
epidemic, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past six years, scientists and AIDS activists have
repeatedly criticized South African leaders for their lack of
leadership in combatting the AIDS epidemic. In 1993, HIV infected 4
percent of South Africa's adult population. Now, it is 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, as conference participants drifted out of the
cricket grounds where Mbeki spoke, many left feeling disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, the majority of South African scientists, would have liked
a clear, unequivocal statement about the relationship between HIV
and AIDS rather than the hints he made,'' said Alan Whiteside, who
heads the AIDS research program at the University of Natal in
Durban.
</P>
<P>
   Whiteside and others said they were encouraged by Mbeki's pledge
to intensify his recently announced program to encourage safe sex
and to sponsor additional research into drug therapy and a possible
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people conducted a protest rally at City Hall hours
before the meeting opened, with Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and
others in the crowd berating the government for failing to speak
frankly about the link between HIV and AIDS and lagging in its
efforts to fight the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   ``AIDS exists, HIV causes AIDS,'' Madikizela-Mandela said. ``We
cannot proclaim this century the African century and then ignore
the AIDS pandemic as some political leaders are.''
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki did speak about the heavy toll of HIV and AIDS on young
people. He also spoke about the toll from malaria, cholera,
syphilis, Vitamin A deficiency, and ``other illnesses with
complicated Latin names'' as among the diseases of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The text of Mbeki's remarks released in advance of his speech
said: ``The world's biggest killer and the greatest cause of ill
health and suffering across the globe, including South Africa, is
extreme poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   When he spoke, he omitted that passage, but referred explicitly
to a 1995 report by the World Health Organization that described
poverty as the world's largest killer. ``Five years later,'' he
added, ``the essential elements of this story have not changed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A strong hint that Mbeki would disappoint most AIDS conference
participants in not saying that HIV causes AIDS came earlier in the
day when scientists canceled a news conference because of what they
said was pressure from the South African government.
</P>
<P>
   The news conference had been scheduled to discuss a statement
signed by 5,000 scientists in the world and known as the Durban
Declaration. It affirmed that scientific evidence supporting the
link between HIV and AIDS is ``clear cut, exhaustive and
unambiguous'' and was published in the July 6 issue of the
scientific journal, Nature, after review by scientific peers.
</P>
<P>
   But the news conference was unexpectedly canceled minutes before
it was to begin. The reason was that ``the South African government
put pressure on us'' and threatened to dismiss any signatory who
worked for the government, said Dr. Charles van der Host, a
professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina who
signed the Durban Declaration.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, van der Host declined to name the government
official who made the call and said the South African scientist who
received it was a representative of the Durban Declaration. The
unidentified official spoke on behalf of Mbeki, van der Host said
he was told.
</P>
<P>
   Tasneem Carrima, a spokesman for Mbeki, denied knowledge of any
such threat. ``We certainly would not threaten anybody,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration came in response to Mbeki's decision to appoint
a panel to review the claims of dissidents who do not believe that
HIV causes AIDS, van der Host said. The panel included such
dissidents and experts who signed the Durban Declaration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought no one would give the denialists credence, and we
were wrong,'' van der Host said.
</P>
<P>
   Van der Host criticized the scientific community for not having
published a summary statement earlier of all the scientific
evidence that HIV causes AIDS. Now, by giving a platform to a small
group of dissidents, Mbeki has helped to divert efforts to fight
AIDS, Van der Host said.
</P>
<P>
   Becoming embroiled in new arguments over the causes of AIDS
diverts attention and resources from finding a solution, several
scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration was intended as a scientific statement because
it was published in a scientific journal, van der Host said.
However, he said, the South African government viewed the
declaration as a political statement. After the declaration was
released last week, Mbeki's spokesman, Parks Mankahlana, said it
should be thrown in the dustbin.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Mbeki's government tempered its stringent criticism
of anti-HIV drug therapy by announcing that it had reversed its
view about AZT, which it had deemed unsafe for pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing his administration's plan to battle AIDS and
responding to critics, Mbeki said ``there is no substance to the
allegation that there is any hesitation on the part of our
government to confront the challenge of HIV/AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   Piot said that underdeveloped countries, though poor, will have
to spend more on AIDS because ``it is about the survival of the
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Mbeki and Piot are leaving the conference early to attend a
meeting of the Organization of African Unity in Lome, Togo, where
AIDS is to be discussed.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers have three chances of
making some sort of comeback in the second half:
</P>
<P>
   1. Bud Selig's funky new realignment goes into effect and
they're all by themselves in the NL West. (OK, throw in the Padres
to make it balanced.)
</P>
<P>
   2. Kevin Malone goes to Atlanta and smuggles Al Leiter, Ryan
Dempster, Tim Hudson and Trevor Hoffman in his carry-on without
anyone noticing.
</P>
<P>
   3. Davey Johnson submits his resignation. ...
</P>
<P>
   --Oh, and by the way, all the Dodgers have to do is move Gary
Sheffield to shortstop - the position he played when he came up
with Milwaukee - and this need for ARod would end. ...
</P>
<P>
   --Tickets for Tuesday's All-Star Game in Atlanta started at $50.
For standing-room-only. ...
</P>
<P>
   --Eric Karros didn't even make the top 10 vote-getters for NL
first baseman? Did someone unstuff the ballot boxes?. ...
</P>
<P>
   --The Albuquerque Dukes' lone representative in the Triple-A
All-Star Game is first baseman Chris Donnels, the former Loyola
Marymount star who leads the Pacific Coast League in homers (26),
RBI (77), runs (71) and slugging percentage (.721). And he's
hitting .349.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Donnels is 34. Karros is 32. ...
</P>
<P>
   --At $475,000 this season, White Sox starter Jim Parque (8-2,
3.51 ERA) looks like a pretty good deal. ...
</P>
<P>
   --Obviously, Lindsay got word from Papa Richard about the fix
still being in. ...
</P>
<P>
   --Venus and Serena sound like the next two expansion franchises
for the WNBA. ...
</P>
<P>
   --And back in the Canadian Football League this season after a
three-year absence ... your Ottawa Rough Riders! ...
</P>
<P>
   --Twenty-seven of the Kings' 41 home dates for the upcoming
season are either on Thursday or Saturday. ...
</P>
<P>
   --Does Tampa Bay really think it has a shot? Not at the Super
Bowl but hosting the 2012 Summer Olympics. ...
</P>
<P>
   --So Missouri doesn't want to play UCLA in football. Meaning
Larry Smith still can't stand the site of a Bruin. ...
</P>
<P>
   --It's Grant Hill who on the commercial tells people to ``obey
your thirst.'' In this case, it's his thirst for Magic cash. ...
</P>
<P>
   --Figure skater Kristi Yamaguchi and Florida Panthers defenseman
Bret Hedican were married this past weekend. In, of all places,
Mauna Lani, Hawaii. ...
</P>
<P>
   --On TV news shows, they show clips every year at this time of
people running away from bulls through the streets of Pamplona,
Spain. Folks, this isn't news. ...
</P>
<P>
   --St. Louis Blues defenseman Tony Twist wins a lawsuit against
comic-book guy Todd MacFarlane for his use of the name ``Twist'' as
one of his characters.
</P>
<P>
   Since when does a person own the rights to a verb? Shouldn't
Chubby Checker get some sort of residual?. ...
</P>
<P>
   --MacFarlane might just name the character ``Twit,'' but then
Twist probably would protest again. ...
</P>
<P>
   --And then there's Darrell Ishida, a guy from Glendale who won a
contest that would have paid him $10 million if a certain
major-leaguer hit for the cycle Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   That player was Alex Rodriguez.

   MABOLO, Cameroon _ Behind the hills next to this Pygmy village
in the Central African rain forest, a pipeline is to be built in a
few years to carry oil to the Atlantic coast, where it will be
shipped to the West.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline, which the World Bank endorsed in June after heated
debates, will be a huge project, costing $3.7 billion. It
represents a big, risky test for the bank and for African
development policies. Historically, the oil exploitation in Africa
has generated ruinous corruption or long-running wars, not wealth
for nations and their citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In this village, there are both doubts and hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where the oil is coming from and where it's
going,'' said the village chief, Marc Nzie. ``I only know it will
pass behind those hills. If they stay behind those hills, then it's
no problem. We won't hunt there anymore. We'll go the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that in this village, which is without electricity,
``if the pipeline is going to pass behind those hills, they have to
give us light.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the World Bank voted on June 6, the pipeline drew an
unusual level of opposition in the West for an African project.
Human rights and environmental groups had joined forces with
residents here and in neighboring Chad, the two countries the
pipeline would cross.
</P>
<P>
   The underground pipeline is to start in southern Chad, a
landlocked desert nation where oil was discovered three decades ago
but where civil wars and unrest have prevented exploitation,
leaving it one of the poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very interested in working with Chad to find a way of
exploiting these oil resources in a way which would channel these
benefits for the poor and to make a difference in terms of
poverty,'' said Callisto Madavo, the World Bank's vice president
for sub-Saharan Africa. ``The stakes are very high. We should be
able to pull this thing off. But I wasn't born yesterday. There are
risks, and I wouldn't underplay them.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the 665-mile pipeline ends, in Kribi, it will have to
cross the Sahel in Chad, the savanna and mountains of northeastern
Cameroon and the virgin rain forests in the south, where the canopy
of trees is broken only by loggers and Pygmy villages like this
one.
</P>
<P>
   To reach this village near the pipeline route, a traveler has to
follow a footpath that breaks off a dirt road and winds through the
forest up and down muddy hills and across creeks to Mabolo, a
village of 13 mud huts. On one morning, heavy rains had dissuaded
the men from going into the forest to hunt. Many sat together in an
open area.
</P>
<P>
   A knock on the chief's door found him on a bamboo bed, suffering
from malaria. Nzie, in his 50s, is renowned as a healer, but he had
been unable to rid himself of a persistent case of malaria. He
calls it ``Kabila,'' after President Laurent Kabila of Congo, whom
the Rwandans and Ugandans, who are supporting the rebels, have been
unable to oust for two years.
</P>
<P>
   The chief's eldest son, Louis Bitouti, 27, who was building a
toy truck, said many younger Pygmies hoped to get jobs from the
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' asked Bitouti, who like other Pygmies here uses his
grandfather's name as his last name. ``I want to be rich like
everyone else. If I lose my father here, how will I live?''
</P>
<P>
   The villagers founded Mabolo five decades ago, they said, and
with about 50 inhabitants it was one of the biggest Pygmy villages
in the region. Although Pygmies are traditionally nomadic hunters,
the villagers have become somewhat sedentary, continuing to hunt
deep in the forest but also growing cassava and yam.
</P>
<P>
   In this country of 14 million people, the Pygmies, the
indigenous rain forest dwellers, number perhaps 100,000. They have
remained without formal schooling, and few speak French, the
language of the former colonial rulers.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant ethnic groups in Cameroon often discriminate
against the Pygmies. Many Pygmies have been forced out of their
home areas by logging companies and security forces, several human
rights studies report, including the State Department report on
human rights in Cameroon in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   A peaceful people, the Pygmies have, perhaps inevitably, become
a focus of those opposed to the pipeline. The Pygmies may be the
most vulnerable and have the most to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the World Bank will give $200 million in loans
to the Chad and Cameroon governments. The amount is small, given
the cost of the project, which will be borne mostly by the oil
companies involved in the joint venture, Exxon Mobil, which would
have 40 percent; Chevron, another American company, 25 percent; and
a Malaysian company, Petronas, 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank support is far more important to the companies
than its financial contribution. Many diplomats in the region say
they believe that the companies would have withdrawn and that Chad
would have turned to other partners, perhaps Libya, if the bank had
not voted yes.
</P>
<P>
   In the last quarter of a century, the western African coast
between Nigeria and Angola has become one of the hottest spots for
oil exploration. But the Western multinational companies have come
under increasing criticism for their practices, especially Royal
Dutch Shell in Nigeria and Elf Aquitaine in Gabon and the Congo
Republic, whose capital is Brazzaville.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not one example in Africa where oil has led to
development,'' said Samuel Nguiffo, secretary general of the Center
for the Environment and Development, a leading environmental
organization here. ``Look at Nigeria, Angola, the two Congos,
Gabon. They all have an overabundance of oil, and what do they have
to show for it?
</P>
<P>
   ``We can even say that the exploitation of oil has retarded
their development. What are the chances that things will be any
different in Chad or Cameroon?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in the capital, Yaounde, where he was visiting
officials, Madavo said he was aware of the history of oil here. He
said he was also aware that Chad had a poor human rights record and
that Transparency International, an organization based in Berlin
that studies corruption, had ranked it the most corrupt country for
two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very, very important that the World Bank, as an economic
institution, not become so risk averse that it would only do the
sure thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Early in June, the bank decided to proceed with the biggest
project that it has been associated with in Africa. In Washington,
officials at the State and Commerce Departments backed the plan.
Their counterparts at the Agency for International Development and
the Environmental Protection Agency, concerned about how the oil
revenues would be spent and the pipeline's environmental effects,
opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement with the bank, Chad agreed to a spending
plan for its oil revenues, with 80 percent for education, health,
social services, rural development and infrastructure; 10 percent
to be kept in a trust for the future; and 5 percent earmarked for
development in the oil-producing region of Doba. The last 5 percent
would be discretionary.
</P>
<P>
   In Chad, where 80 percent of the 7 million inhabitants live on
less than $1 a day, the oil revenues would amount to up to half of
the national budget. Oil money is widely expected to start flowing
in four years and to last for 25 years, for a total of $2 billion.
The government has pledged to respect its part of the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will not be any place for predators of oil revenues,''
President Idriss Deby said in a speech after the bank had voted.
``We will make sure that every centime from oil will produce a
positive effect in the life of every Chadian family.''
</P>
<P>
   The money that Cameroon would derive is estimated at $500
million, or 3 percent of the national budget. Concerns in this
country center more on the ecological effects, because many
environmental groups contend that the huge oil companies have used
substandard controls while exploiting oil in places like the Niger
Delta in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Didier Amougou, an official at Planet Survey, a Cameroonian
environmental organization, said groups like his had shifted from
opposing the project to trying to ensure that it would be properly
built and managed. He said his group would also try to make certain
that those affected by the construction would receive fair
compensation, especially the Pygmies, who are dominated by Bantus
in the rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the Pygmies, we are the white men,'' said Dieudonne Mbuel,
37, a Bantu, explaining how the Bantus had seized most of the rain
forest from Pygmies.
</P>
<P>
   Mbuel, who lives in a nearby Bantu village, Madoungou, said he
had received $500 from the joint venture because the pipeline is
expected to pass through his land. He expected more.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see this mango tree?'' he asked, standing in the thick of
the forest and pointing to a tree taller than the others. ``They'll
have to compensate me for that.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the Pygmies interviewed have received any compensation,
although some are eventually supposed to under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Not too far away, in Ndamayo, Jean Bikanda, a Pygmy, said he did
not believe that he would ever receive any money for the pipeline.
Several months ago, loggers ripped through the forest, creating a
road just in front of his house. He received no compensation, he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Asked his age, Bikanda stood up in his hut and opened a nylon
bag that was hanging in a corner. He took out his identity card,
which most people in Cameroon have. But he was one of the few
Pygmies interviewed who had one. Born in 1938, the card read,
``Profession: Chasseur.'' Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   The prey that Bikanda hunts _ rats, porcupines, rabbits, boars
and antelopes _ fled deeper into the forest because of the loggers,
he said. ``Maybe we will get work from this pipeline,'' he added.
``Maybe this will be good for Cameroon.''
</P>
<P>
   But his son Pierre Mbang, 34, said: ``Work is good, but the
forest is our life. Work is good, but it will end.''
</P>
<P>
   The son was unsure what to make of the World Bank decision.
``That's where all the money in the world is kept,'' he said of the
bank, reinforcing the distance between bank decisions and life on
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Madavo, the bank vice president, who is from Zimbabwe, was
hopeful. ``If it succeeds,'' he said, ``wouldn't that be wonderful
for a story to be written 20 years from now, that on an issue where
there was a lot of doubt and skepicism, that the World Bank stood
up, did its homework, supported something that made a tremendous
difference to Africa? I would love to be alive to see that.''

 &HT;    Michigan school funding reforms brings up new issues
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANN ARBOR, Mich. _ Pioneer High School in Ann Arbor offers its
2,400 students 27 varsity sports, including water polo and
synchronized swimming in a 14-lane, 25-meter pool built just two
years ago. The academic curriculum boasts classes in guitar, Latin
and advanced jewelry design. Career-track programs include culinary
arts, cosmetology and home building.
</P>
<P>
   Ten miles to the north, the Whitmore Lake Public Schools enrolls
a scant 290 high school students district-wide. All elementary,
middle and high school students go to school in side-by-side
buildings that also include the superintendent's office. Course
offerings and extracurricular programs are limited.
</P>
<P>
   Six years after Michigan residents and their political leaders
tore apart and rebuilt the state's school-funding system to make it
fairer and more equitable, the state of Michigan allocates $8,430
for every Ann Arbor Public Schools student, compared to $5,696 for
each Whitmore Lake student. That rankles Whitmore Lake
Superintendent Glenn Bachman: ``What makes my Whitmore Lake student
worth $3,000 less than students at Ann Arbor or other wealthy
districts?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   Some legislators and educators have suggested Michigan's funding
reform could serve as a blueprint for Ohio, and indeed, the
Michigan method would take steps toward satisfying the Ohio Supreme
Court's two strongest concerns about this state's school funding
system: that it relies too heavily on property taxes and provides
an unequal education. Michigan's overhaul, brought about by a March
1994 ballot issue dubbed ``Proposal A,'' shifted the burden of
school funding from local property taxes to the state sales tax. It
boosted funding for that state's poorest districts, narrowing _ but
not eliminating _ the funding gap between Michigan's poorest and
wealthiest school systems.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's hard to find much enthusiasm for Michigan's system,
particularly among that state's educators, some of whom feel the
Michigan ``solution'' created a whole new set of problems.
</P>
<P>
   They suggest school funding is being ``leveled down,'' with some
of Michigan's wealthiest and highest-performing districts feeling
an increasingly tight budget noose with little or no ability to
raise operating money from local voters. They cite the continuing
unfairness of the funding formula to some less-wealthy districts
such as Whitmore Lake. And they wonder what will happen to a school
funding system heavily reliant on a statewide sales tax when an
economic slowdown strikes the state.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Addonizio, associate professor of educational policy
studies at Wayne State University who has written extensively about
Michigan school funding, said proposal A was warmly received by
most parents and taxpayers the first two years after it took
effect. Some of the state's poorest school districts enjoyed a
substantial increase in their state funding in the years
immediately following proposal A, and residents' property taxes
dropped. In one year, the state's portion of school funding jumped
from 37 percent to 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To determine how much money each school district should get
under the new sales tax system, the state took a look at how much
each district spent, per pupil, during the 1993-94 school year.
Property-rich districts were funded at their previously high
levels, while state officials pumped some additional money into the
lowest-spending districts. Michigan then adopted a complex funding
formula that would boost funding for the state's poorest districts
at a faster rate than the wealthiest districts.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Arbor and other relatively wealthy districts saw their
annual increases in per-pupil funding slow to a crawl. Between 1994
and 2000, Ann Arbor received an average annual increase in state
per-pupil funding of 1.8 percent per year. Even the poorer
districts that enjoyed a funding boost during the mid-1990s watched
that growth slow dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more districts hitting a wall each year, seeing their
revenue growth slow down. . . .But if the cost of maintaining your
educational programs rises 3 to 4 percent or more every year, you
eventually are going to have to make cuts,'' Addonizio said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, more and more people are growing impatient with
proposal A,'' Addonizio said. ``Eventually there will be more
political pressure'' to make changes in the funding system.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Arbor school officials estimate they've lost $7.3 million to
inflation to Proposal A. The district has a $148 million budget.
Meanwhile, Pioneer High School, one of Ann Arbor's two
comprehensive high schools, is bursting at the seams with students,
housing 2,500 in a school built for 1,900. The local school board
would like to build a new high school, and they could go to local
voters to seek approval of a property tax bond issue for the
construction money necessary. But Proposal A prohibits them from
seeking a local tax levy to pay for staffing and operating the
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communities do not have any choices about what kind of school
district they want. That's the biggest problem'' with Michigan's
system, said Deb Small, community relations director of the Ann
Arbor Public Schools.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Shulman, head of Ann Arbor's parent-teacher organization,
said Proposal A has had a profound effect on her community's
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone from gleefully spending on whatever sounded good,
to allocating scarce resources,'' Shulman said. ``The impact is
just beginning to be felt. It's going to hit us like a freight
train.''
</P>
<P>
   The district has had to eliminate administrative positions and
reduce technology support in schools, among other cuts. And the
budget looks bleaker next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to keep the cuts as far from the classroom as
possible at this point, but they're getting closer,'' Small said.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Doernte, grants supervisor for the Ann Arbor district,
said ``How much reduction can we take and still maintain the
quality of programs? How much reduction can we take until the
parents begin to walk out? That's the scary part.''
</P>
<P>
   The Birmingham School District in suburban Detroit, also one of
Michigan's wealthiest districts, is in similar predicament,
wrestling with a budget deficit and bracing for staff and program
cuts. Ten teaching and five staff positions as well as a handful of
popular programs, including elementary school Spanish classes, have
been targeted as officials try to bring the district's budget into
balance for next school year. School officials blame Proposal A for
their shortfall and say the problem is only going to get worse.
</P>
<P>
   But Whitmore Lake Superintendent Bachman shakes his head
ruefully at such talk. Bachman says he gets a kick out of listening
to his fellow superintendents commiserate about cuts they'll have
to make to an elementary art program or school nurses _ luxuries
that Whitmore Lake has never seen, but which other districts take
for granted.
</P>
<P>
   It was schools such as Whitmore Lake that Proposal A was
supposed to help. And it has, to some extent: the district's
per-pupil funding has grown from $4,106 to $5,696 since Proposal A
took effect. Most of that bump, though, occurred the first three
years after the constitutional amendment was passed; the increases
have slowed considerably since 1997, and Whitmore Lake still badly
lags the state's wealthiest districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Proposal A had been implemented as it was sold and as it
was intended, there would be very few issues with it,'' Bachman
said. ``But our education budgets are still at the whim of the
legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   The playing field sure isn't level, Bachman said, when the
difference in per-pupil funding between Ann Arbor and Whitmore
Lake, if added up over 12 years of school, would pay for a Whitmore
Lake student's four-year bachelor's degree at the University of
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Plevek, president of Whitmore Lake's Parent Teacher
Student Organization, said she would like to see the
``equalization'' occur at a more rapid pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to attract and keep good teachers, because we
can't pay them'' as much as surrounding districts can, Plevek said.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators seem reluctant to reopen the school-funding debate.
Last month, they passed a three-year education budget that made no
major changes to the funding formula.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators also know if they allow school districts to go to
local voters for additional operating money, the equity gap could
begin to widen again, as property-rich districts reap the benefits
of their communities' wealth. Addonizio said some states have
avoided that trap by requiring communities who vote in additional
operating millage to share some of the money raised with other
districts in the state. For example, for every dollar raised by a
local levy, 25 cents could go into a statewide pot of money to be
distributed to other districts.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Arbor PTO president Shulman said schools must look
aggressively for alternative funding, from considering
``pay-for-play'' for sports and other extracurricular activities to
soliciting local businesses and individuals for donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not make public schools your favorite charity?'' she said.

LACROSSE PLAYING BROTHERS FIND THE SPORT PROVIDES THEM NEW
HORIZONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SOPHIA HOLLANDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ryan Powell's teammates funneled him passes as he hovered around
the goal in the men's national lacrosse final against Princeton on
May 29. It was the final game of the 22-year-old's storied career
at Syracuse, and there were seven minutes left, then four, then
one, and though he would get his first championship, he was a
single point from tying his older brother Casey's school record of
287 career points.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers had competed against each other their entire lives,
trying to be the best in every sport they played. But in this one
moment Casey rooted for his brother to break his record, and Ryan
decided he wanted to tie it.
</P>
<P>
   Casey, 24, watched tensely from the stands in College Park, Md.,
as the final seconds left the clock. Then, with 18 seconds
remaining, Ryan scooped up the ball and smoothly flipped a pass to
a penetrating Ethan Mills, who scored. Ryan had done it. As he
pounded to the sideline, arms raised, his brother roared. It had
been two years since they played on the same front line at
Syracuse, but the four-time all-Americans are linked in school
lacrosse lore.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, the Powell brothers stood on a field in
Columbus, Ohio, and again they made their mark. They were the
starting attackmen for one of two all-star lacrosse teams that are
traveling the Northeast this summer as part of an ambitious
experiment to promote the first professional outdoor lacrosse
league. On Saturday, their team lost, 23-21, but Ryan had four
goals and one assist, and Casey had three goals and three assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little bit of strangeness because I don't get to go
out and play with him that much; but every time that we go out
there and step on the field it seems like we always want to bring
our `A' game to the table because we don't want to get shown up by
the other one,'' Ryan said, grinning. ``So that helps us play a lot
better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Powell brothers and 40 other top players will showcase major
league Lacrosse in six more cities: Philadelphia; Baltimore;
Uniondale, N.Y.; Buffalo; Rochester; and Newark in the conclusion
of the tour on Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   The league's co-founder, Jake Steinfeld, has said that a crowd
of 5,000 is the target audience for each site. Strong support would
mean the founding of an official league next summer.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface it seems like a risky proposition. Lacrosse
remains rooted in the Northeast, though it has still failed to
catch on in major eastern cities, including New York.
</P>
<P>
   Steinfeld, chairman of Body By Jake Enterprises, is joined by
league partners Dave Morrow, president of Warrior Lacrosse, a
leading lacrosse equipment company he founded while playing
championship lacrosse at Princeton; and Timothy Robertson, former
chief executive officer of the Family Channel and the SFX Sports
group. Each partner is skilled at marketing.
</P>
<P>
   All the games will be televised, two nationally. A shot clock
and a two-point play will be added in an effort to inject more
excitement and draw in viewers unfamiliar with the game. Fireworks
and half-time contests are planned and tickets range from $9 to
$15.
</P>
<P>
   Where sports such as soccer have struggled to generate and
promote a series of stars, SFX, which represents Michael Jordan and
Kobe Bryant, will concentrate on creating recognizable faces. The
Powell brothers' extraordinary physical talent and competitiveness,
combined with their open, embracing personalities, have placed them
at the center of that strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Carthage, N.Y., about an hour outside of Syracuse,
the Powells were introduced to lacrosse when an elementary school
gym teacher brought in a lacrosse stick to show his classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was like: `You've got your baseball gloves, football,
basketball. What do you need these sticks for? What's this game?'''
Casey recalled.
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks of whining, their father finally agreed to buy
the $30 sticks. The Powell brothers carried them onto the school
playground, where they chalked boxes, devised challenges and broke
school windows, and into their backyard, where they would play for
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Through high school the Powell brothers teamed up on paper
routes, to mow the lawn at the local cemetery and sell candy at
school to raise money to compete in summer lacrosse camps.
</P>
<P>
   After high school they went to Syracuse, where they quickly
became role models for star-struck lacrosse students. They left New
York state for the first time as they flew to games, staying in
different hotels, in different cities, eating in different
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lacrosse allowed me to do so many things in my life that I
would never have been able to,'' Ryan said. ``Since I've been in
New York, I kind of find myself sitting around people watching
because it's just so exciting to see every different culture. It
all collides here in New York.''

 &HT;    Powell: Build character, not prisons
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. _ Ohio may not have to build another prison
for at least a decade, state officials said Sunday, after remarks
by retired Gen. Colin Powell who urged the nation's governors to
invest more in children, not prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully we have built our last prison for the next 10
years,'' said Reginald Wilkinson, director of Ohio's Department of
Rehabilitation and Correction. ``Gen. Powell is right. We need to
be building up kids, not jails, so they develop character and never
end up in a prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell was keynote speaker at the National Governor's
Association conference, which runs through Tuesday and is being
attended by 38 governors, including Ohio Gov. Bob Taft.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, centered on state's taking advantage of the new
economy, continues today with an address from President Clinton on
health care.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is
national chairman of America's Promise: The Alliance for Youth, a
national crusade started in 1997 to build character of the nation's
youth.
</P>
<P>
   He thanked the governors for helping his program reach millions
of kids and then told them they need to do more.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all of our wealth and success the government is spending
$2 billion on jails,'' Powell said. ``Our children don't start out
there. They deserve to have the right people in their life, people
who will let them know that someone cares.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson and Taft said Ohio's prison population has decreased
by about 2,500 inmates over the last two years. A new $93 million
prison with 1,000 beds is scheduled to open in Toledo this summer,
and Wilkinson believes the state won't need another correctional
facility for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio houses about 46,000 inmates at 31 prisons around the state.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that the state's inmate population continues to
shrink, Taft said the state must continue to support ``character''
classes that have been implemented in some school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Taft said he doesn't want to mandate a character education
program, so that local schools can maintain control of development
classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to start character development at the elementary level
so no child gets left behind,'' Taft said.
</P>
<P>
   Following his address Powell received a standing ovation from
the governors and it was clear that the retired general remains a
key political figure in the Republican party.
</P>
<P>
   Powell has taken himself out of contention to become the running
mate of Texas Gov. George W. Bush on the Republican presidential
ticket. But the retired general said he and Bush remain close
friends and he would be open to accepting a cabinet position in a
Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those conversations with Gov. Bush are private,'' Powell told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Taft won't do much ``policy heavy-lifting'' during the
conference, but his agenda includes lobbying on behalf of the
Piketon uranium plant, which is scheduled for closing by the U.S.
Enrichment Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Taft spokesman Scott Milburn said the governor hopes to speak
with Clinton on the Piketon plant closing. ``We don't think Ohio
got a fair deal,'' Taft said.
</P>
<P>
   Taft also will press fellow governors to pass a resolution to
resolve a conflict with Canadian officials who want to authorize
Canadian television stations to use the same frequency as Ohio's
Multi-Agency Radio Communications System.
</P>
<P>
   If TV stations share the frequency, it would interfere with
Ohio's $272 million, state-of-the-art radio and data communications
network that has been in the works for two years and will be
completed in 2003.

   NEW YORK _ Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   A skin infection, possibly begun by an insect bite, left my
inner thigh swollen and sensitive and finally forced me to visit a
dermatologist.
</P>
<P>
   An inveterate cyclist, I hopped on my Trek trail bike and
pedaled to 63rd Street and Central Park West in Manhattan. Locking
the bike to a street sign, I popped into the doctor's office. The
doctor started me on an antibiotic, but unfortunately, also had to
lance the area and could not anesthetize it before making the
incision.
</P>
<P>
   It was a procedure I hope never to experience again. Afterward,
bandaged and drained, I prepared to leave and remembered I had come
on my bike. The thought of cycling home the way I felt left me
deflated.
</P>
<P>
   I needn't have worried. My bike was gone, along with the
Kryptonite lock that was too strong for Superman but not for a
resourceful New Yorker. I was spared the indignity and discomfort
of trying to return home on my bike. Is this a great city or what?

firemen and kissing him on both cheeks. ``She's really happy to see
us,'' the other, equally surprised fireman said.

<P>
   The neighbor explained her exuberance. ``It's my nephew!'' she
yelled with joy.

   Chris and Hilary Wendel and friends recently took a taxi from
the Upper West Side of Manhattan to Brooklyn. During the course of
the journey, someone in the party mentioned that he was hungry.
Before they knew what was happening, the Egyptian driver pulled
over on Atlantic Avenue, got out of the cab and soon returned with
mango drinks, baklava and other Mideast snacks. He refused payment,
Wendel said, apparently happy to have his passengers experience
Egyptian hospitality. Needless to say, the tip was generous.

   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   My mother's neighborhood (83rd Street and Columbus Avenue in
Manhattan) has changed in the 50 years she has lived there, but the
one constant has been Zingone Brothers, a small family grocery
store on Columbus. Angelo and Nick Zingone, who started working in
the family business as teen-agers, are still there, and the store
has always been more than a grocery for my family. For me, it has
always been a place where everyone knows your name and the last
surviving link to the old neighborhood. When my father lost his
sight, he would test his independent living skills by walking to
Zingone's for a loaf of bread, and more often than not, they would
insist that a young son walk him back home.
</P>
<P>
   After fracturing her hip and undergoing several surgeries, my
mother recently had an appointment at the Hospital for Special
Surgery. She arranged for transportation with her usual car
service. She noticed as she left her building that traffic was
backed up but a car was waiting out front. Her 92-year-old friend
helped her into the car and directed the driver where to take them.
</P>
<P>
   When they arrived, the friend tendered a $20 bill, but the
driver refused it. He was Nick Zingone's son, who had been sitting
in traffic when my mother and her friend suddenly got into the car
and told him their destination. A true Zingone, he thought nothing
of giving her a lift all the way across town.

   Dear Diary:

   As I took my seat on an uptown A train recently I heard, behind
me and farther down the car, a voice singing. A woman in front of
me turned to look, her head snapped back and after she took a
second look, she glanced at a man sitting near her and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the big deal?'' I thought. ``Hasn't she ever heard
singing on the subway before?''
</P>
<P>
   When several other passengers did a double take, I turned to see
what was attracting the attention. The man, singing a Western song,
was wearing a cowboy hat and chaps, and between his legs was a
plastic horse head on a long pole. A second person, crouched behind
him, had a piece of fabric draped over his body, decorated to look
like a horse's rear. Together they galloped down the aisle,
debarked at the next stop and kept singing as they trotted along
the platform.

ALBERT THE GREAT GAINS THREE-LENGTH UPSET 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nick Zito's rookie star, Albert the Great, threw his
hat into the ring for 3-year-old honors Sunday when he opened the
second half of the racing season by outrunning three veterans of
the Triple Crown and leading all the way to score a three-length
upset in the Dwyer at Belmont Park.
</P>
<P>
   Zito reasserted himself after his Triple Crown candidate,
Greenwood Lake, was injured before the Kentucky Derby. And this was
a trainer who won the Derby with Strike the Gold in 1991 and Go for
Gin in 1994. But Zito bided his time, found a new runner in his
barn _ a son of Go for Gin, at that _ and unfurled him Sunday in a
four-horse field that included More Than Ready, fourth in the
Derby; Red Bullet, winner of the Preakness; and Commendable, winner
of the Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   The only outsider was Albert the Great, who did not race as a
juvenile but who won his previous three races this year while the
others were competing for horse history. It was a rare lineup of
classic winners and contenders, and they produced a rare result:
Albert the Great first by three lengths, More Than Ready second by
a length and three-quarters, Red Bullet third by half a length and
Commendable last in a select four-horse field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ecstatic,'' said Zito, who had predicted that his colt
would make a second-half impact in the race for the year's honors.
``It's the best feeling to be opening the second half of the season
by getting back in the 3-year-old campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The odds at post time reflected the unlikely mix of star horses
and their stories. Red Bullet, who had not run since he won the
Preakness almost two months ago, was the favorite at 3-5. More Than
Ready, who had not run since finishing fourth in the Kentucky Derby
two months ago, was next at 9-5. Commendable, who had not run since
he won the Belmont four weeks ago, was a juicy 9-1. And Albert the
Great, who had not run since he won an allowance at Belmont Park
last month, was listed at 7-1 as he took the long stride upward
into stakes racing in his eighth start.
</P>
<P>
   The principal absentee was Fusaichi Pegasus, winner of the Wood
Memorial and the Kentucky Derby, who was widely rated the horse of
the year until he sustained a minor foot injury and missed the
Preakness and Belmont. But his spirit, and his record, hung over
the four horses as they raced to overtake him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that it's over, you can come up with a million reasons why
you won,'' Zito said. ``Red Bullet, coming off the Preakness win
and having time off; Commendable, coming off the mile-and-a-half
Belmont; and More Than Ready, coming off the Derby, all favored
Albert. It takes an exceptional horse to come off allowance wins
and beat those type of horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Richie Migliore, the rider on Albert the Great, reported that
``we bounced out of the gate perfectly,'' and added: ``He really
has a smooth stride once he gets going. Nick and I talked before
the race and figured we wanted to be outside because the rail was a
little dead. Commendable came to me on the outside, but we pushed
it out a notch. More Than Ready came up the inside of us, and my
horse just took off. This colt is only going to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Pletcher, who trains More Than Ready, thought ``the winner
came over on More Than Ready in the homestretch, but didn't make
contact and he was clear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For not having raced in two months,'' he said, ``that was a
good race for him. He beat the Preakness and Belmont winners, and
he finished second.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Bailey, back to work after contending with a kidney stone
all week, noted that Red Bullet ``flipped in the gate,'' and ``he
just didn't have anything.'' And Joe Orseno, who trains the colt
for Frank Stronach, said that Red Bullet was ``totally flat, and
we'll have to rethink our plans.''
</P>
<P>
   But D. Wayne Lukas said that his plans for Commendable hadn't
changed: Next is the Haskell at Monmouth Park on Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come off the Triple Crown,'' he said, ``you have to
regroup for the second half of the season. You can't crank them up
for every start.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert the Great ran the mile and a sixteenth in 1:42 3/5, paid
$16 for a $2 bet to win and earned $90,000 for his arrival in the
big leagues. &QL;

COMMENTARY: COLD FACTS OF GLOBAL WARMING 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those inclined to tout the potential benefits of global warming
would do well to take a look at the news items about the
frightening weather in southern Europe last week.
</P>
<P>
   All week there were stories about the extreme heat and the
raging wildfires it triggered. Temperatures reached as high as 120
degrees and dozens of people died. In some places the problems were
worsened by drought. According to The Associated Press, ``The
sizzling weather accompanied the worst drought to strike the
Balkans in 50 years, which has already caused record crop losses
since it began in late May.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambulances patrolled streets in southern Romania to pick up some
of the many individuals who fainted in temperatures that were well
over 100 degrees. Soldiers were deployed in western Bulgaria to
fight a major forest fire. At least 10 people were reported dead
from the heat in Turkey. Intense fires raged on a number of islands
in the Aegean. And wildfires in Italy consumed hundreds of acres of
forest in the southern Gargano region.
</P>
<P>
   No single weather event can be attributed to global warming. But
this is the kind of terrible weather that scientists have long
predicted would accompany the warming of the planet. That warming
is not only well under way, it is accelerating.
</P>
<P>
   There will be some benefits for some people from global warming.
A study commissioned by the federal government said, for example,
that the United States could see increased crop yields in some
parts of the country and that they could lead to falling food
prices.
</P>
<P>
   But that modest benefit would almost certainly be overwhelmed by
the potentially devastating aspects of the warming that will occur
here and around the world if nothing substantial is done about the
buildup in the earth's atmosphere of heat-trapping gases like
carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   That same federal study, released just last month, warned of
destructive storm surges, chronic erosion of the U.S. coastline,
extreme water shortages in some places, and frequent and severe
flooding in others. The authors of the study said it is very
probable that continued thawing of the permafrost and melting sea
ice in Alaska would cause continued severe damage to its forests,
buildings, roads and coastlines.
</P>
<P>
   A word of caution is in order for anyone who thinks global
warming is a good thing: Be careful what you wish for.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who argue that global warming will be beneficial are
missing two central points,'' said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, chief
scientist of Environmental Defense, a national research and
advocacy organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, until the greenhouse gases are brought under control,
the climate is going to continue to warm, so you're never going to
be at your optimum climate for very long. If the balance of milder
winters vs. hotter summers is struck in a direction that's
favorable to somebody at some particular time _ well, just wait.
The benefits will be ephemeral because it's going to get warmer. In
that situation, today's winners are very likely to be tomorrow's
losers, which means nobody wins over the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   The second point, said Oppenheimer, is the more important one.
``Global warming is a problem that cannot be looked at from the
point of view of a few individuals in a few isolated places. We are
now one globalized world. If the climate in general is hurting
large swatches of humanity, there is no way any particular group
that thinks it's benefiting can escape from what is happening in
the world as a whole. We are too interconnected for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, it's been projected that declines in agriculture,
particularly in low-latitude areas, could create large masses of
environmental refugees. The rest of the world will be affected by
those movements of human populations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same thing can happen as a result of sea-level rise.
Bangladesh is having terrible problems in this area. It has a
population of about 120 million in an area the size of Wisconsin,
and there is already border tension between Bangladesh and India. A
significant chunk of Bangladesh is projected to go underwater in
the next 100 years. Where are those people going to go? There's no
room left.''
</P>
<P>
   It is possible _ not easy, but possible _ to mount an
international effort to cut the emissions of greenhouse gases to an
extent that would ward off a global catastrophe. It's possible. But
there is not a lot of time left.

A STILL-GROGGY PIAZZA RIPS BACK AT CLEMENS
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mike Piazza got up off the mat and came up swinging _
verbally _ at Roger Clemens Sunday night. To the Mets' catcher,
Clemens committed an unconscionable act on Saturday when the
Yankees right-hander gave Piazza a concussion with a fastball to
the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could remember him as a great pitcher, as a Cy Young
award winner,'' Piazza said. ``But I know I can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza missed Sunday night's game against the Yankees, and he
was unsure if he would play in or even go to Tuesday's All-Star
Game, where he is scheduled to be the starting catcher for the
National League.
</P>
<P>
   He said he felt fine, but also that he was groggy and had a
headache. Very soon, Piazza said he will have a magnetic resonance
imaging test to see if the beaning inflicted any damage to his
brain. ``I consider myself very fortunate that I have at least a
little bit of my faculties today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza prepared some comments before answering questions from
the news media Sunday night, and he said that would be the only
time he would ever address the incident. He had plenty to say, and
in doing so gave voice to a rivalry that now may be more intense
between the teams than it is between fans of those teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about the team,'' said Mets General Manager Steve
Phillips. ``It's not exclusively about an individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips forbid the Yankees from using the weight room in the
Mets' locker room, a facility normally shared between teams. He
also scrapped plans to have Mets all-stars Al Leiter and Edgardo
Alfonzo and their families fly on the Yankees' post-game charter to
Atlanta for the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if things are ever over,'' Phillips said. ``Guys
have long memories in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza was upset not only at Clemens but at other Yankees who
said Clemens was only trying to pitch inside when Piazza was hit in
the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it was definitely intentional,'' Piazza said. ``I
could respect the fact that he's throwing inside, I could respect
the fact of getting hit, getting hit in the ribs or the body. I
know that's part of the game, I accept that and I don't have any
problem with that. But I feel there's a difference between that and
almost ending my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens responded by saying he had no reaction to Piazza's
comments. He repeated what he said after Saturday's game, a 4-2
Yankees victory in the second game of their day-night doubleheader.
``I wasn't trying to hit him,'' Clemens said. ``I was trying to
pitch him inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, who has seven hits _ including three homers _ in 12
at-bats off Clemens, was not buying that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got no remorse,'' said Piazza, who added he had no
interest in accepting Clemens' phone call on Saturday. ``I'm kind
of flattered, in a weird way, because he's trying to tell me the
only way to get me out is to try to hurt me.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza and the Mets manager, Bobby Valentine, both said they
felt Clemens would not have thrown such a pitch at Shea Stadium,
where Clemens would have had to hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't say I have respect for him right now,'' Piazza
said. ``Roger has very good control. I think he only walked one guy
during the game. If the shoe fits, that's the way it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, I want to say this: I thought sometime down the line in
my career maybe I could have been a designated hitter. But I think
that's probably not a good thing for baseball. I think that if he
knew he had to come up the next inning, he probably would have been
a little more careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said he did not remember if Clemens threw at any Texas
Rangers when Valentine managed there _ ``We beat him a lot, I
remember that,'' Valentine said _ but he also noted that Clemens
was protected by the presence of a designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are responsible for your actions and the consequences,''
Valentine said. ``In that American League situation, there's very
little responsibility and very little consequences. So your
teammate gets hit in the butt by an 86 mph fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what the Mets left-hander Glendon Rusch did to Tino
Martinez, the first Yankee he faced Saturday after Piazza was hit.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, of course, was hit in a far more dangerous area, and he
wondered if it would have long-term implications on his career.
Piazza is one of baseball's best hitters, but he said he could not
be sure how he would be affected by the beaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's going to take me a little while to get comfortable
in the box,'' he said. ``You have to deal with it. I've been hit
before and you just put it behind you. You can not do the job if
you're not completely comfortable in the box. If you have one ounce
of anxiety or fear, you're not going to play well.''

SPORTS COLUMN: METS, YANKS AND ANOTHER OPERA BOUFFE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's Roger Clemens' story, and he's sticking to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't trying to hit him in the head; I was trying to crowd
him, pitch him inside,'' Clemens said Sunday, reiterating what he
had said the night before. ``The guy's hit me well and I was trying
to make an adjustment, but the adjustment I was trying to make
wasn't to hit the guy in the head.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' pitcher was talking about his pitch that hit Mike
Piazza in the head Saturday night at Yankee Stadium. While Clemens
held to his explanation, the Mets were not buying it. To the Mets,
the pitch, which they viewed as deliberate, signaled the outbreak
of a New York baseball war that may be hostile enough to get George
Steinbrenner's juices flowing again. After all, the Yankees'
doodle-dandy owner turned 70 on July 4, and sometimes it takes the
type of reaction that flowed from Mets officials to boil the blood.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the pointed comments the Mets continued making before
the final game of the four-game interleague series with the
Yankees, Steve Phillips, their general manager, threw about half a
dozen members of the Yankees out of the Shea Stadium weight room
and canceled plans for the Mets' All-Star contingent to fly to
Atlanta with the Yankees' group on a chartered plane after Sunday
night's game.
</P>
<P>
   Had Steinbrenner been immediately privy to the developments, he
would have had the opportunity to add a line to his legendary
lexicon of choice comments. Phillips could have joined Frank
Cashen, one of his predecessors, in the Steinbrenner version of
``Bartlett's Familiar Quotations.''
</P>
<P>
   Hideki Irabu was not the first target of a Steinbrenner zinger
that used the word pus as an adjective. Steinbrenner used that word
years ago to disparage Cashen after Cashen, then the Mets' general
manager, referred to Yankee Stadium by the name of a movie popular
at the time, ``Fort Apache, the Bronx.''
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the teams became so hostile at one point that
the Mets refused to play spring training games against the Yankees.
The Yankees wanted the Mets to play at their spring site in Fort
Lauderdale but would not go across Florida to play at the Mets'
spring home in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Before that period, the Mets once used Dwight Gooden and Frank
Viola in the same spring game and beat the Yankees. Steinbrenner
sneered at the Mets, saying they were so desperate to beat the
Yankees that they saved their Cy Young award winners for them.
</P>
<P>
   In those years, the most important exhibition games the Yankees
played, according to Steinbrenner guidelines, were those against
the Mets that were televised back to New York. The second most
important were games against the Mets that were not televised.
</P>
<P>
   After a Billy Martin-managed Yankees team lost a televised game
to the Mets, Steinbrenner stormed into the clubhouse and started
screaming at Martin. When Martin retreated to the trainer's room,
Steinbrenner followed. The feisty manager yelled back at the owner,
telling him not to yell at him in front of his players. For
emphasis, Martin slammed a table with his hand. Except a big tub of
ice was on the table, and Martin's hand struck the ice, splashing
water all over Gabe Paul, an innocent bystander of a general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Later on, when Lou Piniella was managing the Yankees, he opted
to play a collection of minor leaguers against the Mets. A
Steinbrenner eruption ensued, prompted by his embarrassment in
front of a group of high-powered friends, including Lee Iacocca.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner would not allow his general managers to make trades
with the Mets. When Piniella was the Yankees' general manager, he
had a deal with Joe McIlvaine of the Mets for Rafael Santana, but
Steinbrenner refused to approve it. Finally, after Piniella
implored him to let the trade go through, Steinbrenner told him,
``If we're going to trade with them, get that guy Jefferson.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella had no idea whom his boss meant until he realized that
the cover of a recent baseball publication featured Gregg
Jefferies.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the skirmishes Steinbrenner staged by using
players. If the Mets had a good young player on their team, the
Yankees had to find one to match him. Thus because Dwight Gooden
was a Mets pitcher, the Yankees rushed Jose Rijo to the major
leagues. Tim Leary's presence on the Mets' pitching staff produced
Gene Nelson prematurely for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1985 season, the Yankees and the Mets made stunning
trades days apart. The Yankees acquired Rickey Henderson, the Mets
Gary Carter. The teams subsequently had their new players in town,
holding news conferences only days apart. Steinbrenner was livid
about the newspaper coverage of the events and ordered his public
relations people to tabulate the column inches each received.
</P>
<P>
   When the count ran heavily in the Mets' favor, Steinbrenner
chewed out his public relations staff, saying the Mets' staff had
done a better job.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner has never taken his feud with the Mets to the
ownership level. He has never spoken ill publicly of Fred Wilpon
and Nelson Doubleday, always saying he liked the two men, which is
more than the two men can say of each other.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Mets have branded Clemens as a low-life of a pitcher,
Phillips, a Wilpon-Doubleday lieutenant, could be a marked man. The
next voice heard may be that of General Steinbrenner. &QL;

EDITORIAL: MISSILE DEFENSE MISADVENTURES 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, July 10:
</P>
<P>
   The failure of Saturday's test of the Clinton administration's
prototype missile defense system should be the clinching argument
for delaying any construction of such a system until the next
presidential term. More rigorous testing, and patient diplomacy,
will be needed before a decision can be responsibly taken. In
practical terms, those requirements should defer building a missile
defense system at least until the next president takes office.
</P>
<P>
   Designing a missile shield that could protect against limited
attack from erratic states like North Korea, Iran or Iraq is
reasonable. But the prototype system now being tested has not yet
been shown to be sufficiently reliable to protect American cities.
In the three tests so far, the interceptor twice missed the mock
incoming warhead and produced one partial success.
</P>
<P>
   The failure on Saturday came from a breakdown in one of the
system's simplest components. The sophisticated interceptor vehicle
failed to separate from its booster rocket. As a result, none of
the high-tech sensors the interceptor uses to hunt down its target
were activated. One of the biggest uncertainties is the doubt
expressed by many scientists as to whether the interceptor rocket,
or kill vehicle, can be fooled by cheap, balloonlike decoys. That
question remains unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Given the latest test failure, Washington has every reason not
to rush its decision on building the system, especially since
ordering construction now would unravel existing arms control
treaties. Negotiations with Moscow are continuing on amending the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to accommodate a defensive
system.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, has proposed his own version
of a shared missile defense, which deserves further consideration.
China and Europe also have serious concerns about America's current
missile defense plans.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's original goal was to have a system ready to
use by 2005, the year by which intelligence agencies estimate North
Korea might be able to reach Alaskan or Hawaiian soil with a few
crude nuclear armed missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But whether North Korea is likely to do so is also an important
consideration. Since last fall, North Korea has been observing a
moratorium on long-range missile tests. Other potential threats,
like Iran and Iraq, are considered many years away from being able
to launch intercontinental ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves no compelling reason for ordering construction other
than the perception that doing so might shield Al Gore from
Republican attack. Partisan political considerations should not
drive such an important defense decision.

ALLENBY WORKS OVERTIME TO WIN THE WESTERN OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
  By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEMONT, Ill. _ Robert Allenby finds a way to make playoffs pay
off.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Allenby captured his first win on the PGA Tour by
defeating Craig Stadler in a four-hole playoff in the Houston Open.
In the Western Open on Sunday, Allenby triumphed in another
playoff. After losing a three-stroke lead on the back nine in
regulation, Allenby outlasted Nick Price, winning on the first hole
of sudden death with a par after Price's poor tee shot led to a
bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting a final-round four-under-par 68 at Cog Hill Golf &AMP;
Country Club, Allenby finished at 14-under-par 274 with Price, who
shot a 69. Jim Furyk, Greg Kraft, and Shigeki Maruyama finished in
a three-way tie for third at 12 under par, while Tiger Woods, the
world's No. 1 player and the defending champion, shot a final-round
72 to finish tied for 23rd.
</P>
<P>
   Why is Allenby so cool under pressure? Perhaps because life has
forced him to put golf in perspective. In 1996, Allenby was almost
killed in a car accident in Spain, with multiple injuries putting
his career in jeopardy. Then in 1998, the wife of fellow Australian
Stuart Appleby, Allenby's closest friend on the tour, was killed in
an automobile accident in England. Allenby helped Appleby through
his darkest days, staying with him for about a month, then deciding
to play in the United States largely because he wanted to play with
Appleby.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, Allenby, who turns 29 on Wednesday, took another
step toward being recognized as one of the tour's better players.
He became the tour's sixth multiple winner this year, joining
Woods, Phil Mickelson, Hal Sutton, Jesper Parnevik and Notah Begay
III. That is the kind of company Allenby wants to keep. And with
another playoff victory, he proved again he knows how to capitalize
when he senses a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playoffs must agree with me,'' said Allenby, who started the
day three strokes off the lead but who made eight birdies,
including seven in a 10-hole stretch. ``To beat Nick Price in a
playoff is awesome. He's a great player. He's pretty good under the
heat.''
</P>
<P>
   For Price, who has not won since the 1998 St. Jude Classic, it
was another lost opportunity. Price was doomed after his tee shot
on the playoff hole, the par-4, 452-yard No. 18. His drive drifted
into the right bunker, near the front lip, with trees blocking his
path to the green. His only choice was to hit a sand wedge back
into the fairway, leaving him 107 yards from the green.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing Price hit his tee shot in the bunker, Allenby
wisely hit a 3-wood off the tee into the middle of the fairway,
then hit an approach shot 18 feet from the pin. Price's third shot,
a sand wedge, rolled off the green and down into the rough, 20
yards from the cup. After Allenby two-putted for par, Price needed
to make a chip shot to keep the match going. But it slid past the
hole, giving Allenby the victory and Price a headache.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little disappointed, giving it to Robert on a platter
there,'' Price said. ``The last 13 holes, I hit three good tee
shots. I think I could have won quite comfortably if I had driven
the ball well. Let's put it this way, I don't think that driver's
going to see the light of day again.''
</P>
<P>
   With birdies on eight of his first 15 holes, Allenby reached the
16th tee holding a three-stroke lead over Price, who was on the
15th hole. But Allenby bogeyed both No. 16 and No. 18, while Price
birdied No. 15.
</P>
<P>
   For Woods, it was the first time he did not finish in the top 20
since the Sprint International last August, ending a streak of 23
top-20 finishes. Woods did not sound concerned about his putting,
however, as he looked ahead to his next tournament, the British
Open, where he will try to complete the career Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I putted absolutely terrible going to the United States Open,
and I did all right there,'' said Woods, who was headed to Ireland
for a week of golf and fishing before the British Open. ``I just
couldn't get it going this week. I tried my best. I drove it great.
I just didn't make any of those 10- to 15-footers to get momentum
going.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was Allenby who left with another victory, and $450,000.
Once again, he was forced to work overtime. Once again, it was
worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in six playoffs and I've won all six,'' said
Allenby, counting victories on other tours around the world. ``To
win when Tiger's in the field is awesome. He doesn't lose too many
these days.''

WITH LONGEST ODDS, EARLY PIONEER WINS HOLLYWOOD GOLD CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEN GURNICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Early Pioneer, a former claiming horse
trying Grade I company for the first time and the longest shot in
the field of nine, ran down the 7-5 favorite, General Challenge, in
the stretch and captured the $1 million Hollywood Gold Cup Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Early Pioneer ran the mile and a quarter in 2:01 2/5 for the
one-length victory over General Challenge, with the New York
invader David another length and a half back.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, which paid $51 for a $2 bet to win, was the first
in a Grade I race for all of Early Pioneer's connections: his
owners, David and Holly Wilson; his trainer, Vladimir Cerin; and
his jockey, Victor Espinoza, Hollywood Park's leading rider, who
replaced the regular rider, Matt Garcia, for this race.
</P>
<P>
   David Wilson, who owns several Southern California auto
dealerships and has a 25-horse stable, picked Early Pioneer out of
an Oct. 25, 1998, sprint at Santa Anita based on Daily Racing Form
past performances. He suggested Cerin claim the horse for $62,500
from the trainer Jerry Hollendorfer and the Golden Eagle Farm,
owners of General Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it would not be a good claim when we claimed him,''
Cerin said, adding that he called David Wilson ``after we took off
the bandages and asked if he had claiming insurance. I didn't know
if he'd survive the race. When I first looked at his ankles, I
thought his career might be in jeopardy. But he's 100 percent
sound.''
</P>
<P>
   The $600,000 first-place purse more than doubled Early Pioneer's
career earnings. Most of the $506,815 had come from sprinting, and
he had never run a mile and a quarter until Sunday. His biggest
victory had been the Grade II San Bernardino Handicap on April 9,
when General Challenge finished third behind David. General
Challenge came out of the race with an entrapped epiglottis, which
closes the windpipe during eating, and underwent surgery. This was
his first race in three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to get beat, but he laid his body down,'' the trainer
Bob Baffert said of General Challenge. ``At least the horse is
back. He just got tired.''
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge, who won the Santa Anita Handicap in March
with a sweeping late move, was closer to the leaders in this race,
tracking David and Big Ten on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked him to do something different because fresh horses
tend to be a little keener in a race,'' said Corey Nakatani,
General Challenge's jockey. ``If we'd have had a race under our
belt, I think we would have won it easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the backstretch, Espinoza followed 2 lengths behind General
Challenge. At the three-eighths pole, with General Challenge about
to edge past David, Espinoza got after Early Pioneer, who caught
General Challenge on the outside in the stretch and pulled away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect General Challenge in front of me, but when I
saw him there, I knew it was over,'' said Espinoza, who dyed his
hair gold to mark his first ride in the race. ``I was glad to see
the best horses in front of me because I knew I would catch them.''
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old Espinoza, who also won the $300,000 Triple Bend
Breeders' Cup aboard Elaborate Sunday, got the mount only two weeks
ago. Cerin conceded he had jumped on the jockey's bandwagon,
noticing the dramatic improvement that had put Espinoza ahead of
the world-class jockeys Nakatani, Kent Desormeaux and Chris
McCarron in the Hollywood Park standing. ``I just thought he was an
OK transplant from Northern California who should have stayed
there,'' Cerin said. ``But the kid is phenomenal seeing holes. He's
really developing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cerin, 45, came to California from Yugoslavia through Canada and
graduated from UCLA with a degree in kinesiology, the study of
muscular movement. He became a trainer after he purchased a horse
in partnership with several professional athletes. He said that
Early Pioneer, who is eligible for the Breeders' Cup, would most
likely be pointed toward the $1 million Pacific Classic at Del Mar
on Aug. 26. &QL;

SAMPRAS MAKES HISTORY AT WIMBLEDON 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ In the camouflage of the crowd beneath the
rafters of Center Court, Pete Sampras' camera-shy parents took
nervous peeks at their son on the grass down below.
</P>
<P>
   He was in trouble, and they were helpless. But through the
stress of two rain delays, the near doom of a tiebreaker and the
descending darkness that threatened to suspend a day for history,
Sampras regained his spirits and used his racket like a jaws of
life. Upon his uplifting escape Sunday, at the moment Patrick
Rafter futilely flailed at his inhuman serve, the typically
detached Sampras bent over and wept.
</P>
<P>
   History overcame him. After winning a 6-7 (10), 7-6 (5), 6-4,
6-3 test of his mental resilience for his seventh Wimbledon title,
a dominating Sampras separated himself from Roy Emerson. With about
10 minutes left of daylight Sunday evening, Sampras squeezed in his
moment to become the greatest title winner of all time with his
13th Grand Slam victory.
</P>
<P>
   This is the reason he coaxed his parents out of obscurity and
begged them to submerge their anxieties about watching him. This is
why he prodded them onto a flight after his semifinal victory and
wanted them to witness their first Wimbledon. He needed them to
share this with him. But where were they? With his vision a bit
blurred by his tears, he stood on the court and swiveled his head
in a search of Sam and Georgia Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   In the friends box, his coach and fiancee pointed up high up in
the stands. Deep in the shadows of the stadium, Sampras spotted
them. As fans ushered his parents down the rows, Sampras climbed
over a fence, hopped up the steps and met each for an emotional
embrace. ``I love you so much,'' his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've always been very supportive, very loving,'' said
Sampras, who will be 29 next month. ``They weren't the typical
parents, where they're with me every week. I'm my own man. They've
always given me my independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to thank them for giving me the chance to play this
game, to be able to play here and break this record. I want them to
be a part of it. As much as I like to say I'm going to be back here
every year, there's no guarantee. Win or lose, I wanted them to be
here. If it didn't happen, it didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But it did, beneath glorious applause. There was a great
appreciation for his remarkable run of Grand Slam titles that began
in 1990. In the decade since, Sampras has made mulch of the record
books with his incredible dominance on grass. Sunday, Sampras tied
Williams Renshaw for most men's Wimbledon titles, and he won for
the 53rd time in 54 matches at the All England Club. Perhaps more
incredible, Sampras has not been broken in 87 service games. With
the increased competition, and the fragility of players caused by a
loaded schedule, Sampras' Grand Slam total may be impossible to
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time will tell if it will be broken,'' said Sampras, who still
has the opportunity to add more majors to his record. ``I think in
the modern game, it could be difficult. I mean the next person
might be 8 years old, hitting at a park somewhere around the world.
You never know. There are great players who could do it, but it's
not easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, history was especially tricky. For hours, the outcome on
this drizzly day was uncertain. There was an hour rain delay before
the first serve, a 24-minute stoppage of play midway through the
first set, followed 8 minutes later by a 2 hour 30 minute eternity
that left both players stirring in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   When it ended, Sampras emerged out of sorts. And the unthinkable
happened. Throughout a fortnight when tendinitis mysteriously crept
into his left shin and threatened to undo his run, he could always
use his serve to prop himself up. But in the first-set tiebreaker,
his trusty support system betrayed him. On his last two serves of
an extended tiebreaker, a rattled Sampras felt his heart race as he
served consecutive double faults to help turn the set over to
Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all choke,'' Sampras said candidly. ``No matter who you
are, you just get in the heat of the moment. The title could be won
or lost in a matter of a couple of shots. I really felt it slipping
away.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the second set, the same unthinkable scenario
started to unfold. Sampras began the tiebreaker with a double
fault. And after he tentatively pushed a simple forehand volley way
long, his famously slumped shoulders drooped a little more as he
stared at a celebratory Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   The Aussie with the eroding rotator cuff, with only a limited
supply of serves remaining, was shaking his fist over his
commanding 4-1 lead in the tiebreaker. But then it was Rafter's
turn for a bout of butterflies. During a five-point run by Sampras,
Rafter served a double fault and missed a sure passing shot.
Inspired by his opponent's sudden collapse, Sampras cracked two
volleys for winners. He was alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Oh, God, this is really going downhill,''' said
Rafter. ``I was really going to find it hard to deal with the
nerves more than anything. That was sort of a mental blow more than
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   In an instant, the match sped toward a finish. After letting
nine break points slip away during the match, Sampras broke
Rafter's spirits again in the fifth game of the third set. On the
first break of serve by either player, Sampras came up with a
series of crisp passing shots on his way to taking a 3-2 lead. From
there, Sampras barely flinched. In the last two sets, Sampras
scurried to make history before nightfall postponed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult at the end,'' said Sampras, whose serve
darted even more invisibly as darkness began to arrive. ``It was an
interesting time, interesting day.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also a day that left a major question hanging in the air:
Does the record make Sampras the best who ever played?
</P>
<P>
   ``To seal it, he'd have to win the French Open, and I think he
knows that,'' said Rafter, referring to the only Grand Slam Sampras
has failed to win. ``That's Pete's last big challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like all great champions, I think you've got to win on all
surfaces in the majors. But you know, Pete, in my eyes, still goes
down as the greatest player ever.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Whatever rift there was once between Rafter and Sampras _ one
borne out of a disputed line call two years ago _ there was no edge
to it Sunday. Rafter was gracious in defeat, while Sampras was
humble in victory.
</P>
<P>
   It's a trait Sampras shares with his parents. In contrast to the
attention-grabbing celebration Venus Williams shared with her
tap-dancing father one day earlier, Georgia and Sam wrapped their
arms around their son, and then blended into the background. When
approached by reporters, they kept their customary silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad won't be putting up any signs,'' said Sampras, taking
note of how Venus Williams' father flashed messages from the
visible seat of the friend's box during his daughter's victory.
``He doesn't like the attention like maybe Mr. Williams does.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just my parents, not tennis parents. I mean, when I go
home, I'm the same Pete as I was as a kid. You know, they've given
me strength and the heart to be here. Obviously, as the years go
on, you want them to be part of the situations in your career.''
</P>
<P>
   The opportunities to surpass Emerson's record were shrinking on
Sampras. With his list of injuries that have come with age, many
wondered if this Wimbledon was his last best chance. If it was, he
made the most of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at it as relief,'' Sampras said. ``I never
planned on breaking this record. It's kind of transcended into
something that I put myself in position to do. It hasn't hit me. It
won't hit me for months.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the scope of what Sampras accomplished won't register for
a while, but the emotion was there. It was in his eyes, and in the
faces of two parents dabbing their tears in the background.

EDITORIAL: WIMBLEDON'S CHAMPIONS
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, July 10:
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every Wimbledon tennis tournament produces one unexpected
outcome or another, but this year's was exceptional for the number
of dramatic firsts and emotional milestones. Pete Sampras defeated
the weather, the clock and a noble and agile opponent in Patrick
Rafter to win his 13th Grand Slam title, breaking Roy Emerson's
longstanding record of 12. Seven of these victories have been
achieved on Wimbledon's grass courts, the rest on the hard courts
of the United States and Australian Opens, none on the soft clay
courts of the French Open _ the only shortcoming in Sampras'
otherwise extraordinary career.
</P>
<P>
   A Rafter victory would not have been surprising, given his
riveting semifinal triumph over Andre Agassi. But even if Sampras
had not won, this Wimbledon had already been made memorable by the
Williams sisters, especially Venus. She defeated her younger sister
Serena in the semifinals, then dominated the defending champion,
Lindsay Davenport, to become the first African-American woman since
Althea Gibson in 1958 to win Wimbledon. On Friday, Venus and Serena
became the first African-American team to reach a Wimbledon doubles
final, and they may yet win the doubles title in a match delayed
until today by the same rainfall that nearly forced a postponement
of the men's final.
</P>
<P>
   In that event, Sampras was not to be denied. Despite occasional
shakiness in his normally lethal serve, he began to return Rafter's
serve with increasing precision and power. By the fourth set,
Sampras was clearly the more confident of the two, and Rafter had
little to offer in return. This should not be the end of it for
Sampras. Though he seems to have been dominating the game forever,
he is still only 28 years old.

HAROLD SACK, 89, CONNOISSEUR OF AMERICAN FURNITURE, DIES

 By RITA REIF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harold Sack, the nation's pre-eminent dealer in American period
furniture, who paid a staggering $12.1 million for an 18th-century
Newport desk-bookcase in 1989, died on Saturday night after a brief
hospitalization at South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside,
N.Y. He was 89 and lived in Oceanside.
</P>
<P>
   Sack, who was president of Israel Sack Inc., bought the boldly
carved bonnet-topped mahogany secretary by John Goddard at
Christie's in New York, stunning the art world by paying what was
then the highest price ever at auction for an object other than a
painting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all masterpieces hang on the wall,'' Sack said that day
after the gavel came down on his purchase. The desk, which he
bought for Robert M. Bass, a Texas financier, was at 9 feet high
the tallest surviving example of a status symbol for the merchants
of Colonial America. Its pedigree was enviable: It was had
descended in the family of the original owner, Nicholas Brown of
Providence, R.I., from which Brown University took its name.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was nearly blind and had to use a wheelchair after
suffering for a decade from Parkinson's disease, Sack was until a
month ago usually at his desk at the Israel Sack gallery, 730 Fifth
Avenue, at 57th Street, three times a week. He worked there with
his younger brothers, Albert, the vice president, and Robert, the
treasurer. As recently as January, he had sold another rarity with
a million-dollar price tag: an 18th-century Philadelphia Pembroke
table that had been discovered recently and was the only known such
piece with cabriole legs.
</P>
<P>
   Sack came into the family business as president in 1933, fresh
out of Dartmouth College, where he was Phi Beta Kappa and had
graduated magna cum laude a year earlier, majoring in English
literature. The Depression was deepening, the antiques business was
in turmoil, and his father, Israel, who had galleries in Boston and
New York, was forced to liquidate to pay his debts.
</P>
<P>
   Abandoning plans to do graduate work at Oxford, Sack and a
colleague formed Israel Sack Inc., a new corporation with two
stockholders, few assets and no cash but with Israel Sack's good
name and his talent for buying and selling. The elder Sack, who
came to the United States in 1903, had been a cabinetmaker in a
small shtetl in Kovno, now Kaunas, in Lithuania, where he was born.
After landing in Boston, he worked for two years at making
reproductions, repairing antiques and peddling furniture before he
founded his own business on Charles Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was very young and went on buying trips with my father
in his open Buick touring car through the Massachusetts
countryside, I learned how to recognize masterpieces and to pay
more for them,'' Harold Sack said in a 1987 interview. ``My father
moved fast, paid high prices and then sold what he bought for even
higher prices.''
</P>
<P>
   These traits made envious dealers at the time call him Crazy
Sack. But Israel Sack's knowledge, enthusiasm and savvy about
American furniture won over the early collectors of American
furniture, including industrialists like Henry Ford and Henry
Francis duPont, as well as Francis and Mabel Garvan (utilities and
transportation) and Ima Hogg (Texas oil) and Maxim Karolik, a
failed opera singer who married Boston money and spent it wisely.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Sack, too, was always daring in his buying, paying record
prices for antiques, especially after his father's death in 1959,
when he began to dominate the field. When he blinked or raised his
pencil or paddle at auctions, the prices for American antiques
rose.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1960s into the 1990s, bidding with a gambler's gleam in
his eye, he rewrote scores of auction records for American
furniture. In 1977, he raised the record for American furniture to
$135,000, buying a Boston bombe chest. In 1980 he pushed the record
to $396,000, for a block-front Newport chest. And in 1983 he did it
again, paying $687,500 for a Newport kneehole desk, all at
Sotheby's. The $12.1 million he paid at Christie's for the mahogany
secretary in 1989 remains the record for American furniture,
although an 18th-century Italian cabinet brought $15.2 million in
1990 at Christie's in London.
</P>
<P>
   Sack sold these and other choice pieces to postwar
industrialists and businessmen, and he also bought for and sold to
the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the
Museum of Fine Arts Boston, Colonial Williamsburg and the Henry
Francis duPont Winterthur Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harold Sack's association with the Metropolitan Museum goes
back more than 40 years,'' said Morrison H. Heckscher, curator of
decorative arts. ``He was a founding member of the Friends of the
American Wing and remained one. In 1980, Harold, representing the
three Sack brothers, made a generous contribution to the wing to
honor their father. His name appears above three federal period
galleries.''
</P>
<P>
   As a dealer, Heckscher said, Harold Sack's ``alchemy'' combined
``his charm, his excellent eye, his business acumen and his
powerful analytical intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Sack was born in Lynn, Mass., the eldest child of Israel and Ann
Sack, and went to Boston Latin School before Dartmouth. He later
served as an adviser to Clement E. Conger, curator of the
Diplomatic Reception Rooms at the State Department, in forming that
collection. He served as a national trustee throughout the 1980s at
the Baltimore Museum of Art and lectured extensively at Colonial
Williamsburg, Winterthur and elsewhere. He wrote articles on the
history of American furniture and on collecting, and he was author
with Max Wilk of ``America Treasure Hunt,'' the story of Israel
Sack, the man and the business, published in 1987 by Little, Brown
&AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his brothers, he is survived by his wife, the
former Loretta Dorn; four sons, Dr. Kenneth Sack of Tiberon,
Calif., David, of Pearland, Texas, Michael, of Philadelphia, and
Daniel, of New York; and eight grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Martin Wunsch, a New York consulting engineer and a 40-year
veteran of collecting American furniture, said in assessing Sack's
career: ``Harold Sack helped to elevate the field of American
antiques radically. When Harold came into the business, if you had
money, you bought English or French furniture. But he saw American
furniture of the 18th and 19th centuries as a reflection of
America's growth, strength and originality. And he helped make
collectors see that, too.''

HAROLD AKS, 78, WHO LED CHORAL GROUPS  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Harold Aks, a conductor and music teacher at Sarah
Lawrence College and the Dalton School for nearly half a century
whose amateur vocal group became a respected part of New York's
musical life in the 1950s and 60s, died on June 30 while on
vacation in the Canadian Rockies. He was 78 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was congestive heart failure, said his son, David.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1940s Aks was hired to conduct the Interracial
Fellowship Chorus, a group of 150 amateur singers that reflected
the diversity of New York. He led the group until the late 1960's.
He also founded the Dorian Chorale, a 22-member professional group
specializing in contemporary vocal music.
</P>
<P>
   Aks was born in Yonkers and grew up in Brooklyn. He studied
music at Brooklyn College. During World War II he served as a
weatherman for the Army Air Corps, stationed in India.
</P>
<P>
   After the war Aks studied at the Juilliard School of Music,
graduating in 1948 with a bachelor's degree in choral conducting.
His teachers included Robert Shaw and Pierre Monteux. Aks taught
music and conducted the chorus at the Dalton School from 1949 to
1997 and at Sarah Lawrence from 1954 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Aks' third wife, Patricia, died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son, of Northridge, Calif., he is survived by
his companion, Lorie Hartman of Manhattan; a daughter, Catherine
Aks of Brooklyn; a stepson, Michael Untermeyer of Philadelphia; a
stepdaughter, Kathryn Untermeyer Atwood of Concord, Mass.; a
sister, Esther Ray of Freehold, N.J.; and four grandchildren.

COMMENTARY: THE COMING BACKLASH AGAINST `THE BIG TEST' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   By BRENT STAPLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The national obsession with getting into a brand-name college
has bled down into grade school, where children who have yet to
reach puberty are biting their nails over the SAT. More than 2
million high school students will sit for the tests this year,
after concerned parents have shelled out tens of millions of
dollars for special preparation classes. In the frenzy of practice
and preparation, students will ignore the carefully worded booklet
from the College Board, which sponsors the test. The booklet notes
that the test has nothing to do with innate intelligence _
suggesting that no such thing exists. Nor does it measure either
what was learned in high school or motivation, creativity and
special talents, factors that affect success in college. The SAT is
rather a test of mental dexterity, one element among many in
predicting college performance.
</P>
<P>
   These caveats have always been true. Even so, the SAT was
promoted as a sacred index that tells all about the individual.
Real estate agents sell houses based on scores at nearby public
schools. Educational rating services evaluate colleges based partly
on average SAT scores. Bond-rating companies are said to take the
scores into account when judging a college's creditworthiness.
</P>
<P>
   When the scores are mailed out this year, high school guidance
offices will fill with anguished, tearful teen-agers for whom
disappointing scores will seem a stain on their lives, if not the
end of the world. These teen-agers and their parents were the
target audience when Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts
announced that prospective students would no longer be required to
submit SAT scores with their applications. Over all, about 390 of
the country's 1,800 four-year colleges and universities do not
require the tests. But in discarding the SAT requirement, Mount
Holyoke followed several other quality liberal-arts institutions,
including Bates, Bowdoin, Bard and Connecticut College.
</P>
<P>
   These highly ranked colleges have long since counted the test as
no more than about 10 percent of the admission process, relying
instead on high school transcripts, graded papers, letters of
recommendation and an evaluation scheme that rates high schools in
terms of academic rigor. A faculty committee at Holyoke concluded
after several years of research and internal debate that the test
should be optional. Holyoke's president, Joanne Creighton, was
personally convinced by reading Nicholas Lemann's 1999 book, ``The
Big Test: The Secret History of the American Meritocracy,'' which
documents how the SAT became a tool for class segregation.
Creighton describes Holyoke's decision as a way of saying that
``our process is individualized, rigorous and includes qualitative
material'' _ and does not favor the rich, who can lay out vast sums
for test preparation.
</P>
<P>
   But this was also a marketing decision. In general, schools that
drop the test requirement enjoy a surge of applications that allows
the school to remain highly selective, while attracting a stronger,
more diverse student body. Holyoke is hoping to replicate what
happened at Bates College in Maine, which has seen its application
pool double since 1984, when SAT scores were no longer required.
More than a quarter of Bates students come with no SAT scores. A
study of the Bates students found that they had the same grade
point averages and the same graduation rates as Bates students who
took the SATs, which raises profound doubts about why the SATs are
given such weight in the first place. ``These students say, `I am
not being accurately measured by these standardized tests,' '' said
William Hiss, a vice president at Bates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We misunderstand intelligence when we think of it as a
unidimensional quality _ or in terms of the math and verbal scores
on the SAT,'' Hiss said recently, adding that Bates seeks out
students who have shown ``disciplined success'' in a variety of
areas, including those who write exceptional application essays or
who have made a definitive difference in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   The positive response from guidance and college communities
suggests that Holyoke's decision could herald a backlash against
the tyranny of the big test. &QL;

MAN ATTACKS PASSER-BY WITH PIECE OF CONCRETE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis.)   By C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A young woman walking from church to an East Side
subway station suffered a fractured skull Sunday afternoon when she
was struck from behind by a man wielding a melon-sized chunk of
concrete, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the woman, Tiffany F. Goldberg, 25, occurred
minutes after noon. It was the latest frightening and seemingly
random assault in a public place in Manhattan, and bore uncanny
similarities to the attack last November on Nicole Barrett, a young
woman from Texas who was attacked in Midtown by a man who smashed
her skull with a 6{-pound paving stone.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Brown, who lives directly across the street from the
scene of Sunday's crime, came out of her building moments after
Goldberg was struck. She said an off-duty firefighter, who had
leapt from his car as the attack occurred, began helping Goldberg
as she toppled to the sidewalk in front of an electrical
substation.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg was bleeding heavily, she said, and the firefighter was
cradling her head and trying to stanch the flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just floored,'' Brown said. ``But she was conscious,
because she was squeezing the hand of this guy who was helping
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, who moved to New York four years ago and is a waitress
at the Bryant Park Grill in Manhattan, was taken to Bellevue
Hospital Center; the authorities there said she had survived the
attack with surprisingly few injuries. Wes Anglin, the hospital
administrator on duty, said she was in stable condition Sunday
night and described her as ``alert and oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Andrew McInnis, a police spokesman, said that the stone
struck her directly in the back of the head, fracturing her skull,
and that she also suffered two chipped teeth and lacerations when
she fell face-first to the ground. But there was no apparent sign
of neurological damage, the authorities said, and Goldberg was held
for observation and to wait for a specialist to interpret the
results of a CT-scan.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis also said that although Goldberg had no recollection of
the attack, she had remained conscious throughout the afternoon and
was strong enough to be interviewed by detectives. She had also
been able to talk by telephone with her father in Madison, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has talked with many people, but she is unaware of exactly
what happened, because she was hit from behind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Barrett, Goldberg, 25, was not robbed. Brown said her
handbag was undisturbed on the ground near where she fell. And like
Barrett, Goldberg had no known connection to the man who assaulted
her, the authorities said. As in the earlier assault, the man who
fractured Goldberg's skull ran away and was not immediately
apprehended.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities declined to discuss their investigation in
detail but said that they were seeking a man, believed to be in his
20s to 40s, who was about 5 feet 6 inches tall and 150 pounds, and
was wearing a bright gold shirt at the time of the attack. They
also said the chunk of concrete, apparently from a shattered
sidewalk, was recovered on the street. It weighed 3 to 5 pounds,
the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police supervisors said the investigation's initial focus was on
the homeless, because two witnesses said the man who struck
Goldberg appeared disheveled. Detectives were seen late Sunday at
the nearby Bellevue Men's Shelter. Bernard Samson, a shelter
supervisor, said the police took a man into custody for questioning
Sunday about 5:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The police would not confirm that they had a man in custody, and
said the investigation was following other leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just attacking the homeless, we're looking at many
possibilities,'' McInnis said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the buildings on the block where Goldberg was attacked
have security cameras pointed toward the sidewalks. But the two
cameras at the electrical substation are still being installed and
were not working Sunday, said Sandy Miller, a spokeswoman for the
utility company Con Edison.
</P>
<P>
   However, Miller said, the police had obtained videotape from
another building. ``There's an adjacent building with a camera
working, and I am told that the police have a videotape of the
entire attack,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The police declined to comment about any videotape.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Goldberg, who lives in Manhattan, had moved to New York four
years ago, the police said. She had lived in Brooklyn until
recently and planned to enroll at Columbia University this fall.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday she had attended the 10:30 a.m. service at the Marble
Collegiate Church and lingered afterward for coffee and pastry.
McInnis said she planned to pick up a newspaper and return home by
subway, and was attacked just after leaving the church.
</P>
<P>
   About 12:10 p.m. she was walking on the sidewalk when the man
slammed the concrete into her head. Brown, who arrived seconds
later, described a disturbing scene: a young woman, stylishly
dressed in a blue sleeveless top and black pants, sprawled on the
ground, struggling through the disorientation and blood, trying to
sit up. The firefighter was holding her head. He was calmly urging
her to stay down.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis said that given the severity of the attack, the outcome
was surprising. ``She's conscious,'' he said. ``It appears she's
going to be fine.''

EDITORIAL: REBUILDING DEMOCRACY IN PERU  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, July 10:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This spring Alberto Fujimori mugged democracy in Peru, retaining
his presidency by winning an illegitimate election and runoff vote.
Although Peru erupted in protest and foreign governments rebuked
him, Fujimori gambled that his adversaries would not have the
stomach to make him hold a truly democratic election.
Unfortunately, this cynical strategy is proving to be correct. It
is still possible, however, to rebuild the democratic institutions
that Fujimori has destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Although election observers from the Organization of American
States documented widespread unfairness, Brazil, Venezuela and
Mexico led the OAS to acceptance of Fujimori's victory. The OAS
sent its chief, Cesar Gaviria, and the Canadian foreign minister,
Lloyd Axworthy, to Peru in late June to start working out a
democratization program with Fujimori and his opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The OAS has been there before. After Fujimori's assumption of
dictatorial powers in 1992, the OAS sent a similar mission, which
Fujimori manipulated. He is trying to do so again. He has endorsed
the group's goals for reforms _ which are worthy, but extremely
vague _ and set up an unimpressive democracy commission.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition has asked for the government to take several
steps to show its good faith before the opposition is willing to
negotiate a specific democratization plan. They include restoring
the constitutional court judges Fujimori fired when they blocked
his re-election plans and sacking Vladimiro Montesinos, the
sinister intelligence chief. The OAS must not settle for cosmetic
change again. It should demand a strict democratization program,
with measurable benchmarks, beginning with the removal of
Montesinos from all political influence.
</P>
<P>
   If Fujimori lags, the OAS ought to be willing to act, perhaps by
instructing members to withdraw their ambassadors, deny visas to
Fujimori and Montesinos, and vote against certain loans to Peru in
the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. If the OAS is not
willing to sanction Fujimori for noncompliance, Washington should
act on its own. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   James C. Quayle, a newspaper publisher from Indiana and the
father of former Vice President Dan Quayle, died Friday at 79.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle died at a care center in Sun City West, Ariz., where he
had been treated for 2{ years, said his wife, Corinne Pulliam
Quayle of Wickenburg, Ariz. The cause was not immediately known,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle was chairman of Huntington Newspapers Inc. in Indiana and
a former member of the John Birch Society.
</P>
<P>
   He published The Huntington Herald-Press, a daily newspaper in
northern Indiana, from 1963 to 1990, with a hiatus of six years
that began in 1972 when he turned to publishing The Muncie Star and
Evening Press. He and his wife became the owners of The Huntington
Herald-Press in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle also served on the board of directors of Central
Newspapers Inc., a company founded by his father-in-law, Eugene C.
Pulliam.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle is survived by his wife and the former vice president, as
well as by two other sons, Christopher P., of Carefree, Ind., and
Michael, publisher of The Vincennes Sun-Commercial, also in
Indiana; and a daughter, Martha Quayle Thomas of Monticello, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   James C. Quayle was born in Joliet, Ill. He began his newspaper
career in 1945 when he landed a job as an advertising salesman in
Lebanon, Ind. He began selling advertisements for The Portsmouth
Daily Times in Ohio in 1947 and moved to Huntington the next year
as advertising manager of The Herald-Press.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, he went to Phoenix to work as public relations and
personnel director for The Arizona Republic and The Phoenix
Gazette. He returned to Indiana in 1963 to become publisher of The
Huntington Herald-Press and bought the newspaper from Central
Newspapers Inc. in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, after his son was nominated for vice president, Quayle
vigorously defended his son's credentials, especially in response
to questions about whether Dan Quayle had avoided the draft in the
Vietnam War by joining the National Guard. In an article for The
New York Times' Op-Ed page in 1988, the elder Quayle said he was
beginning to see the news media in a different light after their
questioning of his son's past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having spent most of my working life in the newspaper
business, I thought I knew something about journalism,'' he wrote.
``Being on the receiving end of a media blitzkrieg, however, gives
you a different perspective on the matter _ fast.''

GREENE'S DASH FOR GOLD BEGINS WITH A LONG, SLOW JOURNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The world's fastest man stood perfectly still,
waiting not for the crack of a starter's pistol but for the click
of a camera. He wore a black V-neck sweater over his muscled chest
and black slacks, and he stood posed against a white brick
storefront. Maurice Greene seemed remarkably patient at rest for a
man with such kinetic possibility.
</P>
<P>
   He closed his eyes against the afternoon spring sun, a look of
contentment on his face, and a slight weariness, too, that perhaps
came from rigorous training or from being the sleep-deprived father
of an infant daughter. A passerby approached on the sidewalk and
was reluctant to step between Greene and the camera, but Greene
opened his eyes and smiled and motioned for the woman to walk past.
</P>
<P>
   The sprinter's agent, Emanuel Hudson, noticed the polite,
small-town gesture and chortled, ``Where do you think you are,
still in Kansas?''
</P>
<P>
   Greene holds the world record at 100 meters, 9.79 seconds, and
is seeking to win the 100, 200 and 400-meter relay at the 2000
Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. The vanity plates on his
Mercedes read, ``MO GOLD.'' Four years ago, however, he still lived
in Kansas City, Kan., his hometown, where he had won the state
100-, 200- and 400-meter championships as a high school senior in
1993, but where his professional career languished, providing
neither public recognition nor financial security.
</P>
<P>
   He had worked on a loading dock, and according to his current
training partner and two-time Olympic bronze medalist, Ato Boldon
of Trinidad and Tobago, he had ``held the 10 worst jobs in the
fast-food industry.'' He had beaten Carl Lewis once over 100
meters, but when Lewis was asked about the promising young Greene,
he responded, ``Who?''
</P>
<P>
   A nagging hamstring injury ruined Greene's training for the 1996
Olympic trials, and he finished seventh in the quarterfinal round
of the 100 meters. Dejected, he drove to the Summer Olympics in
Atlanta as a spectator instead of a participant. He said he sat in
tears in the Olympic Stadium as Donovan Bailey of Canada won the
gold medal and set a world record in 9.84 seconds, telling himself,
``This will never happen again without me.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly two months after the Olympic final, on Sept. 27, 1996,
Greene arrived in Los Angeles, having loaded his belongings into a
sport utility vehicle and driven halfway across the country with
his father. He had come to train with the renowned sprint coach
John Smith, who like a mechanic took Greene's sprinting style apart
and rebuilt it.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Greene lowered his personal best in the 100 by a
staggering amount in an event in which improvement comes grudgingly
by hundredths of a second _ from 10.08 seconds to 9.86 _ equaling
the fastest time that Lewis ever ran in a career that produced nine
Olympic gold medals. In the biggest race of the year, at the 1997
world championships in Athens, Greene defeated Bailey and, at the
finish line, deliciously stuck his tongue out at the Olympic
champion.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no more fast-food jobs for Maurice Greene, only
fast races. Last year, he built a season that only Lewis and Ben
Johnson had ever matched in terms of dominant sprinting. Greene
lost only one race, and on June 16, 1999, in Athens, he lowered the
world record for 100 meters by a stunning five-hundredths of a
second to 9.79 _ the largest margin by which the record had ever
been reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Last August in Seville, Spain, Greene won the world
championships at 100 meters and at 200 meters, establishing himself
as a direct threat in the 200 to the Olympic champion and world
record-holder Michael Johnson. The personable Greene is also as
voluble as he is fast. If Johnson is Superman, Greene said, then he
was Kryptonite.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's personal best at 200 meters of 19.86 seconds, run in
1997, is faster than Johnson has run at sea level since he
shattered the world record in 19.32 seconds at the Atlanta
Olympics. They have raced only twice at 200 meters, splitting the
races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give him all the respect he deserves,'' Greene said of
Johnson, ``but when he steps on the track, I'm not looking at him
as the greatest there is. He's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago in Osaka, Japan, Greene posted the fastest 100 in
the world this season (9.91). On June 30, he won a race in Rome in
9.97 seconds, breaching 10 seconds for the 27th time in his career,
12 more times than did Lewis, more times than any sprinter in
history.
</P>
<P>
   However, his dominance of a year ago has eluded him. Already,
Greene has lost three times at 100 meters this season. Recently he
finished fourth in a 100-meter race in Athens and fifth in Glasgow,
running 10.54 into a stiff headwind, a langorous time that he had
not posted since high school. He returned to Los Angeles, saying
his legs were ``dead and sore.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, Greene withdrew from two meets, complaining
of tired legs. This is not the time of year to be bothered by
fatigue, considering that the Olympic track and field trials begin
Friday in Sacramento, Calif., and Greene is facing three rounds
apiece of the 100 and 200 meters, including his expected showdown
at 200 meters with Michael Johnson on July 23, Greene's 26th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, his coach, insisted that nothing more serious than jet
lag and a few lost pieces of luggage were bothering Greene. He
pointed out that from June 24 through July 2, Greene ran five races
in nine days on two continents, across 10 time zones and with wild
temperature variants, to simulate the rigor of running rounds at
the Olympic trials. He said that after some needed rest, Greene
would be in his accustomed form at the trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not concerned at all,'' Smith said. ``There are no
injuries. Maurice is healthy and when he's healthy, no one can stop
him from doing anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he would become the fastest sprinter in his family,
Maurice Greene was not the first. His older brother, Ernest Greene
Jr., ran a career best of 10.24 seconds in the 100 and advanced to
the semifinals of the 1992 Olympic trials. Maurice's track career
began at age 8, when he joined a club coached by Al Hobson, who is
now the coach at Kansas City (Kan.) Community College.
</P>
<P>
   Three times Greene won the Kansas state high school 100- and
200-meter championships at Schlagle High, but poor scores on
standardized tests ended any hopes of playing football or running
track at a major college.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   From the foundation of Ewing Kauffman, the late owner of the
Kansas City Royals baseball team, Greene had received a Project
Choice scholarship, which would pay all of his college expenses.
This allowed Greene to attend a pair of junior colleges without
having to compete on the track teams, saving his speed and avoiding
the burnout that collegiate runners often experience by racing too
often. He kept training with Hobson and in 1995 he defeated Lewis
at the Texas Relays, finished second in the 100 at the national
championships in Sacramento and reached the quarterfinals of the
world championships in Goteborg, Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   It was in Sacramento that year that he caught the eye of Hudson,
the agent, and Smith, the coach, who together have a management
company called Hudson Smith International, also known as Handling
Speed Intelligently, or HSI, which is a full-service provider for
sprinters _ track training, media training, tax planning and
investment advice. During a warmup for the 100 meters at the
national championships, a rainstorm occurred, and while most
sprinters headed for cover, Greene remained on the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell he was not afraid,'' Hudson said. ``He was
focused on his job and he was not going to melt because of getting
water on him. He was someone you had to look out for.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Greene decided to head west to train under Smith _
who still holds the world record in the discontinued 440-yard dash
and has coached Olympic sprinters to five gold medals. At the 1999
world championships, athletes in the HSI training group won more
gold medals than any country but the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Greene had two things in common that drove them _ an
insatiable desire to obliterate conventional wisdom about sprinting
and the lack of an Olympic gold medal. Several weeks before the
1972 Summer Games in Munich, Smith had injured a hamstring muscle.
Once favored in the Olympic final, he pulled up after only 80
meters. In a sense, Hudson said, Smith is continuing to pursue his
own gold medal through the success of the sprinters he coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm awfully hungry,'' Smith said. Of the elusive gold medal,
he added, ``I look up and I still don't have one. It's like the
movie `Groundhog Day.' I keep doing it over and over so I can see
if I can get it right.''
</P>
<P>
   The general assumption about the 100 meters has been that a
sprinter can accelerate for only about 60 meters. The winner of a
given race is not the athlete who speeds up at the end, but the one
who slows down the least. By devising a low, measured drive out of
the blocks, Smith seeks to delay the onset of top-end speed so that
it can be achieved at 70 or 75 meters, leaving less distance for
deceleration and less time for the crumbling of a sprinter's form.
</P>
<P>
   He has the race broken down to 45 steps, each stride alloted
0.083 seconds on the ground, the feet striking below the hips for
maximum efficiency and the spikes raking the track instead of
braking. He wants his sprinters to think of their arms and legs as
circular levers and themselves as human wheels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of it as pushing a bicycle wheel down the street as a
kid,'' said Boldon, the 1996 Olympic bronze medalist at 100 and 200
meters. ``You don't grip the wheel to keep it moving fast, you just
tap it quickly on and off.''
</P>
<P>
   Translating theory to practice, of course, can be difficult on a
track, where there is no such thing outdoors as a controlled
environment. For months, Greene struggled with Smith's teachings,
thinking his way through races instead of relaxing and running. He
had come to Los Angeles to run faster and now he was running
slower. How could this be? Each day after practice, he sometimes
stayed at the UCLA track for an hour or two, frustrated, telling
himself, ``Why is this happening to me?''
</P>
<P>
   As the 1997 national championships in Indianapolis approached,
he was dejected, even considering another line of work. But Smith
approached him, said, ``It's time to kick it up,'' and the next day
Greene won in 9.90 seconds, 18-hundredths of a second faster than
his personal best had been entering the season. A month later, he
became world champion, lopping another tenth of a second off his
personal best.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't think about running the 100, you have to feel it,
and that's what Maurice does,'' said Inger Miller, a training
partner of Greene's and the women's world champion at 200 meters.
``He feels it, controls it. He knows the race like the back of his
hand. He's very patient with his running.''
</P>
<P>
   And because he has matched the steroid-discredited time that Ben
Johnson ran at the 1988 Summer Olympics and because he has whittled
such chunks of time from his personal best, Greene has come under
suspicion _ never proved _ that his speed comes from
performance-enhancing drugs. It is a charge frequently made against
HSI sprinters by other athletes, and one always denied, never
documented. The countercharge is that other people are jealous, and
not willing to put in the same hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people believe you can do it with God-given talent, some
people believe you have to be on something,'' Greene said. ``You
can't change anyone's mind, no matter what. It's sad, but you can't
keep worrying about what people think. I'm clean. I hope they do
blood testing at the Olympics. I'll be the first in line. I have
nothing to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a ballet dancer, Greene rehearses his stride in front of a
mirror, monitoring the way he lifts his legs and raises his hands.
Sometimes, before a big race, he has been known to take a piece of
paper, write a time faster than he has ever run and store it in his
racing spikes. He has everything he did not have four years ago _ a
reputation, a world record, a seven-figure income _ everything but
an Olympic gold medal. If he does not get three of them in Sydney,
he said, ``My career will have a void.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I intimidate a lot of people,'' Greene said. ``They
get into a race and think they have to do something extra to beat
me.''
</P>
<P>
   His goal is to run 9.76 seconds. Smith believes that eventually
Greene can run 9.6-something. The coach believes there is no speed
limit. He is like a whittler, certain that he can shave
five-hundredths of a second here or there, even a full tenth of a
second, from Greene's best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you can put the record where it should be,'' Smith said,
``and blow everybody's mind.''  &QL;

COLUMN: THE STATE PIE AND HOW TO CUT IT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOYCE PURNICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City, upstate and the suburbs. It's the
classic three-way cut, how candidates, political analysts and
pollsters always divide up New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Elections are more than statistics, but numbers are inescapable,
and crucial, which raises a provocative question: Are we defining
each of the three slices of the state pie correctly? That's always
easier to answer after the fact, but so far, it looks as if the
answer is no. The suggestion here is that candidates, pollsters,
strategists and journalists belatedly faced facts and overcame
their New York City-centrism, but haven't begun to pay enough
attention to the suburbs. That could be a problem, especially this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican candidate for Senate, Rick A. Lazio, represents
Suffolk County, on the state's eastern stretch of suburban life,
Long Island. The Democrat, Hillary Rodham Clinton, moved from the
White House to Chappaqua, in suburban Westchester. And the
Republican presidential candidate, George W. Bush, is running as a
social moderate and fiscal conservative _ in other words, he's
positioned himself as the candidate of suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   The suburbs could well emerge as the battleground in New York,
yet the pros still think of them as basically three or four places
_ Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester and maybe Rockland _ as if suburban
sprawl hadn't come to New York. It has. And in more than three or
four places.
</P>
<P>
   There is Staten Island, which votes more consistently with the
suburbs than with the other four boroughs. Why not lump it with the
suburbs? There are also what might be called the extended suburbs,
the counties north and west of the city: Orange, Putnam, Sullivan,
Ulster, Dutchess, Columbia and (again) Rockland. Those 11 counties
have accounted for 32 percent of the statewide vote in recent
elections, compared with 29 percent for the city without Staten
Island (or 31 percent with), and 39 percent for upstate (the 47
counties north and west of Columbia County). It makes a lot of
sense to view the counties as a voting bloc, says Philip Friedman,
a political strategist and proponent of this theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, they vote cohesively, share the same concerns and
have proven a willingness to split tickets, and so deserve maximum
attention from both candidates,'' said Friedman, who supports
Clinton and provides his observations to some of her advisers, but
is not working for any candidate in New York this year.
</P>
<P>
   Elections are won or lost on a lot more than numbers, of course.
Disaffection with Mario M. Cuomo, for instance, energized voters
upstate, severely injuring him in the 1994 gubernatorial race. Four
years later, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato lost to Charles E. Schumer
in part because he had worn out the welcome he once enjoyed among
Democratic city voters.
</P>
<P>
   This year, such ambiguous factors as Clinton fatigue and Lazio's
callow image seem to be influencing voters. But demographics and
voting patterns will still play a role, and there's a good argument
that the conventional wisdom hasn't caught up with reality.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the city vote remains solidly Democratic, but now
that it accounts for as little as 29 percent of the statewide vote
(down from 41 percent in 1960), Clinton and Al Gore will need to do
well upstate and in the suburbs even if they get overwhelming
support in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is spending a great deal of time upstate, but recent
election results show that while the suburbs lean to the
Republicans, they are less ideological, more flexible, and voters
there are more willing to switch parties: The 11 suburbs strongly
supported Gov. George E. Pataki in 1998, and 10 of the 11 voted for
Clinton in 1996 (only Putnam supported Bob Dole).
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the suburbs _ more than the four core city boroughs
_ are growing, while upstate has lost population, estimates show.
The suburban counties also consistently vote alike; all 11 voted
the same way (mostly Republican) in seven of the last 10
presidential elections, for example.
</P>
<P>
   While the suburban counties are traditionally Republican, Nassau
and Westchester increasingly vote Democratic, and all 11 counties
are ideologically flexible. The voters care about the same issues
that interest suburbanites everywhere. Polls show they are socially
moderate and fiscally conservative, in favor of gun control and
abortion rights. ``They care about quality of life,'' said
Friedman, the political strategist. ``These are people worried
about schools, safety, the environment, property taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is reasonable to expect a campaign dominated by talk about
those very issues. Assuming the candidates have figured out the
not-so-complicated State of New York.

SCHUMER CALLS FOR ACTION TO PREVENT AN ENERGY CRISIS
</HEADLINE>
 By SHERRI DAY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If present trends continue, the United States, and
New York state in particular, could face the most serious domestic
energy crisis since the 1970s, Sen. Charles Schumer said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, in a news conference at his Manhattan office, said a
report by his office showed that the nation's inventories of crude
oil, natural gas and home heating oil are at or near a 24-year low,
while the demand for them and for electricity is rising. That, he
said, could indicate that an energy emergency lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have a mild summer and a mild winter, which would
take much of the pressure off our inventories,'' Schumer said, but
added, ``All it would take is a somewhat unseasonably hot summer or
cold winter to push us over that line.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer has called on President Clinton to create a national
energy commission to study energy use and production nationwide.
The presidential commission is necessary, he said, because Congress
is divided on how to handle energy issues.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman, P.J. Crowley, said that the Clinton
administration had put before Congress a number of proposals to
deal with the energy situation, but that Schumer's ideas were
welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Stu Nagurka, a spokesman for the federal Department of Energy,
said the department had not yet reviewed the senator's report.
</P>
<P>
   In New York state, gasoline prices have surged to an average of
$1.64 per gallon, according to a survey by AAA.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said New York was in a precarious position because of
the state's reliance on home heating oil and the generally high
price of gasoline throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   According to state Public Service Commission reports, over the
last three years, New York City's peak electricity demand has
increased by 700 megawatts, which equals the output of an entire
electricity plant. Power failures are likely during the summer
because of the limited capacity of transmission wires to import
energy from other regions and the inability to put new generating
plants in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer also proposed miles-per-gallon standards for sport
utility vehicles, which represent 40 percent of all new car sales
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   If the president accepts his proposal for an energy commission,
Schumer said, he would like to see members represent
energy-producing states like Alaska and Texas as well as consumer
and environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   The senator also said he supports using alternative energy
sources like solar energy, giving tax breaks to new electricity
plants that use clean natural gas and promoting energy conservation
efforts.

 &HT;    Armstrong plans to ascend in peaks
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAX, France _ When Alberto Elli stepped to the podium Sunday
afternoon to accept his bouquet of zinnias and daffodils and show
off his yellow jersey, most thought it would be the Italian's final
time to be in the sweet limelight at the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's 112-mile stage from Agen to Dax in southwest France was
the final stage in which the sprinters, such as the 36-year-old
Elli, could shine. Mapei's Paolo Bettini won stage nine in a time
of 4 hours, 29 minutes and 6 seconds. However, unlike the past few
races, when sprinters bolted and stayed far from the main group of
cyclists, the peloton rode conservatively, with 157 of them
receiving the same winning time as Bettini.
</P>
<P>
   The overall standings didn't change. Lance Armstrong, the
defending Tour champion, remained in 16th place, 5:54 behind Elli.
He received the same time as Bettini.
</P>
<P>
   Expect that to change today when the riders enter the intense
mountain phase of the Tour. Today's 127-mile stage from Dax to the
mile-high summit of Hautacam in the Pyrenees Mountains should
scramble the leader board, with the real competitors stepping
forward to compete for the yellow jersey.
</P>
<P>
   To complicate an already difficult stage, snow is forecast for
parts of the day. There likely will be a heavy mist as the cyclists
try to get up three major climbs, including the summit finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fifteen guys ahead of Lance won't be in front of him after
Monday,'' predicted Frankie Andreu, Armstrong's teammate with the
U.S. Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong clinched his Tour championship last year, when he won
consecutive stages, winning a time trial at Metz and the first
mountain stage at Sestrier in the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   Time margins in the flatter stages tend to be measured in
seconds, if it all, which is what happened Sunday. In the
mountains, where Armstrong and former Tour winners Marco Pantani
and Jan Ullrich are expected to fare well, riders cross the finish
line many minutes apart.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said he ``prioritized'' his main threats before the
start of the Tour. None of riders he foresaw as his competition
have gone past him in the first nine stages. ``I was trying to
visualize all the different scenarios,'' he said. ``You have to
prioritize. I don't think we have yet to see who is strong. The
race starts Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, like he did last year, paid close attention to the
Tour's mountain courses when he trained for the event in May. He
rode today's course several times to learn every nuance, every
mountain pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a long training ride,'' he said. ``I went up it, then
rode back down and did it again a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   Cyclists have ridden the flatter stages more aggressively than
they did last year. The speeds have been faster and there have been
more riders willing to attack. Earlier last week, members of the
Postal Service were content to let the sprinters go. But over the
weekend, the American team became more aggressive, with riders such
as Andreu and Kevin Livingston chasing down the riders trying to
escape the peloton.
</P>
<P>
   Elli tried a breakaway early in Sunday's stage in order to pad
his lead. But Livingston stayed with him. ``We were just trying to
have representation in the top group,'' Andreu said.

LACK OF PREP MAYBE HURT GENERAL CHALLENGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ It seemed as though all the fretting and
questions about General Challenge's fitness following a three-month
layoff would be forgotten as the gelding charged into the lead at
the top of the stretch Sunday afternoon at Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   In the final eighth of a mile of the Hollywood Gold Cup,
however, General Challenge lost the lead and a chance to make
history. He finished a strong second under jockey Corey Nakatani, a
length behind long-shot winner Early Pioneer, and his connections
seemed pleased with the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can work them all you want, but there's nothing like a
race,''trainer Bob Baffert said. ``You hate to get beat like that,
but he laid his body down and gave it a good effort, so at least we
know he's back strong.''
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge had a chance to become the first horse since
Affirmed in 1979 to win the Santa Anita Handicap and the Gold Cup
in the same year, and bettors made him the 3-2 favorite Sunday. But
all week long, Baffert couldn't escape questions about the horse's
condition.
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge, a winner in three of his previous six Grade I
starts, had last raced April 9 in the San Bernardino Handicap at
Santa Anita and finished a disappointing third. He also had surgery
to correct a breathing problem, but Baffert proclaimed his horse
ready to run.
</P>
<P>
   The horse trained well leading up to the Gold Cup, but after the
race, Baffert conceded that General Challenge could have benefited
from a prep race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lacking a recent race, that might have been a factor,''
Baffert said. ``I thought when he turned for home, he looked like a
winner.''
</P>
<P>
   As expected, David and Big Ten set the pace early, but General
Challenge remained close, somewhat surprisingly, just two lengths
off the lead after a half-mile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked him to do something a little different because he was
fresh, and fresh horses tend to be a little keener in a race,''
Nakatani said. ``He came out and positioned himself perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   Going into the final turn, General Challenge made his move and
pulled ahead of David by a length, but Early Pioneer came from the
outside and passed General Challenge in the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being off for three months and being an athlete, you've got to
think he lost some kind of fitness,'' Nakatani said. ``The other
horse just outran us today. If we'd have had a race under our belt,
I think we would have won it easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Nakatani rejected the suggestion that General Challenge might
have been better served by staying behind the leaders early and
stalking the pace from farther behind, the way the horse typically
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The track was fast, it was fast all day,'' Nakatani said. ``I
don't care about the fractions, I just care about how the horse is
running, and he was right there. He ran a strong race.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert said he intends to next run General Challenge in the
Aug. 26 Pacific Classic at Del Mar.

SAMPRAS MAKES HISTORY AT WIMBLEDON 
</HEADLINE>
   (CORRECTS score in 3rd graf)  
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ In the camouflage of the crowd beneath the
rafters of Center Court, Pete Sampras' camera-shy parents took
nervous peeks at their son on the grass down below.
</P>
<P>
   He was in trouble, and they were helpless. But through the
stress of two rain delays, the near doom of a tiebreaker and the
descending darkness that threatened to suspend a day for history,
Sampras regained his spirits and used his racket like a jaws of
life. Upon his uplifting escape Sunday, at the moment Patrick
Rafter futilely flailed at his inhuman serve, the typically
detached Sampras bent over and wept.
</P>
<P>
   History overcame him. After winning a 6-7 (10), 7-6 (5), 6-4,
6-2 test of his mental resilience for his seventh Wimbledon title,
a dominating Sampras separated himself from Roy Emerson. With about
10 minutes left of daylight Sunday evening, Sampras squeezed in his
moment to become the greatest title winner of all time with his
13th Grand Slam victory.
</P>
<P>
   This is the reason he coaxed his parents out of obscurity and
begged them to submerge their anxieties about watching him. This is
why he prodded them onto a flight after his semifinal victory and
wanted them to witness their first Wimbledon. He needed them to
share this with him. But where were they? With his vision a bit
blurred by his tears, he stood on the court and swiveled his head
in a search of Sam and Georgia Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   In the friends box, his coach and fiancee pointed up high up in
the stands. Deep in the shadows of the stadium, Sampras spotted
them. As fans ushered his parents down the rows, Sampras climbed
over a fence, hopped up the steps and met each for an emotional
embrace. ``I love you so much,'' his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've always been very supportive, very loving,'' said
Sampras, who will be 29 next month. ``They weren't the typical
parents, where they're with me every week. I'm my own man. They've
always given me my independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to thank them for giving me the chance to play this
game, to be able to play here and break this record. I want them to
be a part of it. As much as I like to say I'm going to be back here
every year, there's no guarantee. Win or lose, I wanted them to be
here. If it didn't happen, it didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But it did, beneath glorious applause. There was a great
appreciation for his remarkable run of Grand Slam titles that began
in 1990. In the decade since, Sampras has made mulch of the record
books with his incredible dominance on grass. Sunday, Sampras tied
Williams Renshaw for most men's Wimbledon titles, and he won for
the 53rd time in 54 matches at the All England Club. Perhaps more
incredible, Sampras has not been broken in 87 service games. With
the increased competition, and the fragility of players caused by a
loaded schedule, Sampras' Grand Slam total may be impossible to
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time will tell if it will be broken,'' said Sampras, who still
has the opportunity to add more majors to his record. ``I think in
the modern game, it could be difficult. I mean the next person
might be 8 years old, hitting at a park somewhere around the world.
You never know. There are great players who could do it, but it's
not easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, history was especially tricky. For hours, the outcome on
this drizzly day was uncertain. There was an hour rain delay before
the first serve, a 24-minute stoppage of play midway through the
first set, followed 8 minutes later by a 2 hour 30 minute eternity
that left both players stirring in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   When it ended, Sampras emerged out of sorts. And the unthinkable
happened. Throughout a fortnight when tendinitis mysteriously crept
into his left shin and threatened to undo his run, he could always
use his serve to prop himself up. But in the first-set tiebreaker,
his trusty support system betrayed him. On his last two serves of
an extended tiebreaker, a rattled Sampras felt his heart race as he
served consecutive double faults to help turn the set over to
Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all choke,'' Sampras said candidly. ``No matter who you
are, you just get in the heat of the moment. The title could be won
or lost in a matter of a couple of shots. I really felt it slipping
away.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the second set, the same unthinkable scenario
started to unfold. Sampras began the tiebreaker with a double
fault. And after he tentatively pushed a simple forehand volley way
long, his famously slumped shoulders drooped a little more as he
stared at a celebratory Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   The Aussie with the eroding rotator cuff, with only a limited
supply of serves remaining, was shaking his fist over his
commanding 4-1 lead in the tiebreaker. But then it was Rafter's
turn for a bout of butterflies. During a five-point run by Sampras,
Rafter served a double fault and missed a sure passing shot.
Inspired by his opponent's sudden collapse, Sampras cracked two
volleys for winners. He was alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Oh, God, this is really going downhill,''' said
Rafter. ``I was really going to find it hard to deal with the
nerves more than anything. That was sort of a mental blow more than
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   In an instant, the match sped toward a finish. After letting
nine break points slip away during the match, Sampras broke
Rafter's spirits again in the fifth game of the third set. On the
first break of serve by either player, Sampras came up with a
series of crisp passing shots on his way to taking a 3-2 lead. From
there, Sampras barely flinched. In the last two sets, Sampras
scurried to make history before nightfall postponed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult at the end,'' said Sampras, whose serve
darted even more invisibly as darkness began to arrive. ``It was an
interesting time, interesting day.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also a day that left a major question hanging in the air:
Does the record make Sampras the best who ever played?
</P>
<P>
   ``To seal it, he'd have to win the French Open, and I think he
knows that,'' said Rafter, referring to the only Grand Slam Sampras
has failed to win. ``That's Pete's last big challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like all great champions, I think you've got to win on all
surfaces in the majors. But you know, Pete, in my eyes, still goes
down as the greatest player ever.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Whatever rift there was once between Rafter and Sampras _ one
borne out of a disputed line call two years ago _ there was no edge
to it Sunday. Rafter was gracious in defeat, while Sampras was
humble in victory.
</P>
<P>
   It's a trait Sampras shares with his parents. In contrast to the
attention-grabbing celebration Venus Williams shared with her
tap-dancing father one day earlier, Georgia and Sam wrapped their
arms around their son, and then blended into the background. When
approached by reporters, they kept their customary silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad won't be putting up any signs,'' said Sampras, taking
note of how Venus Williams' father flashed messages from the
visible seat of the friend's box during his daughter's victory.
``He doesn't like the attention like maybe Mr. Williams does.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just my parents, not tennis parents. I mean, when I go
home, I'm the same Pete as I was as a kid. You know, they've given
me strength and the heart to be here. Obviously, as the years go
on, you want them to be part of the situations in your career.''
</P>
<P>
   The opportunities to surpass Emerson's record were shrinking on
Sampras. With his list of injuries that have come with age, many
wondered if this Wimbledon was his last best chance. If it was, he
made the most of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at it as relief,'' Sampras said. ``I never
planned on breaking this record. It's kind of transcended into
something that I put myself in position to do. It hasn't hit me. It
won't hit me for months.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the scope of what Sampras accomplished won't register for
a while, but the emotion was there. It was in his eyes, and in the
faces of two parents dabbing their tears in the background.

DAIMLERCHRYSLER EYEING OFFICE SPACE IN NEW YORK'S LANDMARK CHRYSLER
BUILDING 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Chrysler Building in midtown Manhattan was an
icon of the automobile age when it opened in 1930, with stylized
hubcaps and racing cars on setbacks, hood-ornament gargoyles and a
stainless steel spire thrusting skyward.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy years later, Walter Chrysler's glorious 77-story Art
Deco tower may again become a powerful symbol for an automaker
whose fortunes are as dependent upon popular images and Wall Street
perceptions as it is on engines and the open road.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler AG, one of the world's largest companies with
revenues of more than $150 billion and principal offices in
Stuttgart, Germany, and Auburn Hills, Mich., said Sunday that it
planned to rent space in the Chrysler Building as a ``virtual
headquarters'' _ a meeting place for its board and a center for its
investor relations and public relations staffs.
</P>
<P>
   For DaimlerChrysler _ whose stock has plummeted since
Daimler-Benz swallowed the Chrysler Corp. in November 1998 _ the
upper reaches of the landmark tower at 42nd Street and Lexington
Avenue would provide luxury space for only about 100 of the
company's hundreds of thousands of employees.
</P>
<P>
   But it would reaffirm the American roots of a company that has
been viewed increasingly by investors as a European behemoth with
the global aspirations its chairman, Juergens Schrempp, and put the
company's key image makers squarely in the media and financial
capital of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good opportunity if we can move to the Chrysler
Building,'' Michael Pfister, a DaimlerChrysler spokesman, said by
telephone from Stuttgart.
</P>
<P>
   Confirming a report in The Detroit News &AMP; Free Press Sunday,
Pfister said that DaimlerChrysler's investor and public relations
departments would be moved from Auburn Hills to New York, and that
the company hoped to lease space in the Chrysler Building for those
staffs, as well as meeting space for it's 13-member board of
managers. The boar currently meets twice a month in New York in the
Seagram Building on Park Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Pfister said the deal was not yet set and declined to discuss
details of reported negotiations with Tishman Speyer Properties, a
principal owner of the Chrysler Building. Tishman Speyer could not
be reached Sunday for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The News &AMP; Free Press reported that DaimlerChrysler had offered
$100 per square foot for the top five floors, and would provide $5
million for renovations, including a restoration of the Cloud Club,
where Chrysler executives once wined and dined in marble-and-bronze
splendor with sweeping views over the city.
</P>
<P>
   When it opened on May 28, 1930, the Chrysler Building _ William
Van Alen's architectural masterpiece _ was briefly the world's
tallest structure at 1,046-foot, but was topped by the Empire State
Building in 1931.
</P>
<P>
   The building's lobby featured red Moroccan marble with a ceiling
mural 110 feet long and 76 feet wide by Edward Trumbull, the theme
of which was industrial and transportation progress. The mural was
restored last year.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler's founder, who insisted upon the automotive iconography
in the architecture of the building, occupied a lavish suite of
offices at the top.
</P>
<P>
   However, Chrysler did not establish a corporate headquarters in
his building, choosing instead to rent out its offices and keep
Chrysler offices in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The Chrysler Building's facade was designated a New York City
landmark in 1978. In 1997, Tishman Speyer and the Travelers Group
bought the building for $225 million.
</P>
<P>
   Schrempp, DaimlerChrysler's chairman, is said to be acutely
aware of the advantages of a company presence in New York City,
near Wall Street and the headquarters of the major American media.
</P>
<P>
   Since the merger creating DaimlerChrysler, the company's stock
has lost about half its value _ it closed at 54 1/8 on Friday _
blamed largely, financial experts contend, on investor perception
of the company . American investors made up half of the
shareholders of the merged company in 1998, but now make up only
about a quarter of the shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Schrempp is said to believe that a move to the Chrysler
Building, even by a few key operatives, could represent a powerful
signal that a company with global ambitions was ready to play in
New York.

SPORTS COLUMN: A MOST NOBLE VICTORY FOR SAMPRAS
</HEADLINE>
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ At approximately 8:37 p.m., with darkness
rapidly falling, Wimbledon officials were close to calling the
championship match. Pete Sampras and Pat Rafter had played grueling
tennis for nearly three hours, going at each other like ram and
bull.
</P>
<P>
   The match had been stopped twice due to rain, and all told they
had been involved in this match for several hours. But now in the
fourth game of the fourth set, Sampras _ leading by two sets to one
_ decided it was time to go home. He reared back and sent a 131 mph
serve past Patrick Rafter for an ace that gave him a 30-0 lead. He
went on to win game four, broke Rafter's serve in game five, won
game six, broke Rafter in game seven and served to win the match in
game eight.
</P>
<P>
   In a span of 24 hours we witnessed tennis history played out at
two different speeds, two contrasting styles, two different souls.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, 20-year-old Venus Williams performed pirouettes after
winning Wimbledon for the first time on an afternoon shellacked by
promise of more days to come. Sunday night, Sampras, 28, grabbed
history after he won a record 13th Grand Slam championship and his
seventh Wimbledon title.
</P>
<P>
   When the match ended there was no leaping. Sampras bowed and
squatted, tears in his eyes. Then he walked around. He looked for
his parents, Sam and Georgia, who chose to sit high in the stands
to avoid television cameras, a contrast to Richard Williams, who
said he stayed in the limelight largely to keep pressure off his
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents are not tennis parents,'' Sampras said. ``You see a
lot of cases where parents get too involved. They've always kept
their distance. They've always given me my space.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night Sampras displayed all the qualities of the hero:
The loss in the first set, vulnerability near defeat, then a last
gasp comeback and a final triumph.
</P>
<P>
   He hadn't played well for the tournament and was almost
convinced that he would lose the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I found my game when I had to,'' Sampras said, then when
he was asked if this was the best day of his tennis life he said:
``With everything that's happened, I'd say this is one of the best
moments. It's hard to really tell you how I feel in 10 minutes. But
as the months go by and the years go by, I'll look back at these
two weeks as the most difficult and the most satisfying.''
</P>
<P>
   The cheering interest of this match were defined before the
players played their first game. Sampras and Rafter emerged from
the players tunnel together. When they took their seats Rafter
pulled off his warm-up bottoms to a smattering of cheers from
female admirers.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter is the 27-year-old Australian with a beard and a ponytail
and funky good looks. Sampras is clean cut, but has no public
persona to speak of and is not the celebrity-style athlete of a
dot-com age.
</P>
<P>
   But to understand and appreciate what Sampras has accomplished
you have to love tennis, understand tennis. He is Hank Aaron, not
Babe Ruth. Joe Louis, not Muhammad Ali. Jack Nicklaus, not Tiger
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night Sampras played a grinding, grueling game of tennis
that neatly frames his career.
</P>
<P>
   No flash. Terribly efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras lost the first set in a tiebreaker and was down by 4-1
in the second set tiebreaker before coming back to win it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serving at 4-1, I really felt like it was slipping away,'' he
said. ``Somehow I got through that tiebreaker. From a matter of
feeling like I was going to lose the match, I felt like I was going
to win the match within two minutes. That's grass tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   He searched down into a reservoir of victorious moments and
searched for a frame of reference that could carry him through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was slipping away,'' Sampras said. ``When you're
sitting on the changeover you think of past matches that you've
lost the first set _ to Becker, 7-6, at one stage, came back and
won the next three. There's time. You reflect on your past
experiences, being able to get through it.''
</P>
<P>
   At least on this day, Rafter's frames of reference couldn't pull
him through. Sampras jumped on his opponent in the third and fourth
set. ``I was making him work, making him work,'' Sampras said.
``Even though I was losing some of his games, I felt like it was a
matter of time before eventually I was going to break him. I lost
my nerve in the first set, he lost his nerve serving 4-1 in the
second tiebreaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, Sampras fulfilled the heroic mission .
</P>
<P>
   ``I never, ever planned on ever breaking this record,'' he said
of Roy Emerson's 12 Grand Slam victories. ``You don't plan on
breaking records like this. It's kind of transcended into something
that I put myself in a position to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' he said. ``It really is amazing, this
tournament just panned out for me. I didn't really feel like I was
going to win here.''
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the match, Rafter had received the most
cheers when he pulled off his warm-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Now, hours later, the moment of truth had come and gone. The
stadium was engulfed by darkness tinted with slivers of natural
light and camera flashes. The roar of the crowd was aimed at
Sampras, who raised his arms in triumph.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, he was an illuminating figure.

   NEW YORK _ A young woman walking from church to an East Side
subway station suffered a fractured skull Sunday afternoon when she
was struck from behind by a man wielding a melon-sized chunk of
concrete, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the woman, Tiffany F. Goldberg, 25, occurred
minutes after noon. It was the latest frightening and seemingly
random assault in a public place in Manhattan, and bore uncanny
similarities to the attack last November on Nicole Barrett, a young
woman from Texas who was attacked in Midtown by a man who smashed
her skull with a 6{-pound paving stone.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Brown, who lives directly across the street from the
scene of Sunday's crime, came out of her building moments after
Goldberg was struck. She said an off-duty firefighter, who had
leapt from his car as the attack occurred, began helping Goldberg
as she toppled to the sidewalk in front of an electrical
substation.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg was bleeding heavily, she said, and the firefighter was
cradling her head and trying to stanch the flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just floored,'' Brown said. ``But she was conscious,
because she was squeezing the hand of this guy who was helping
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, who moved to New York four years ago and is a waitress
at the Bryant Park Grill in Manhattan, was taken to Bellevue
Hospital Center; the authorities there said she had survived the
attack with surprisingly few injuries. Wes Anglin, the hospital
administrator on duty, said she was in stable condition Sunday
night and described her as ``alert and oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Andrew McInnis, a police spokesman, said that the stone
struck her directly in the back of the head, fracturing her skull,
and that she also suffered two chipped teeth and lacerations when
she fell face-first to the ground. But there was no apparent sign
of neurological damage, the authorities said, and Goldberg was held
for observation and to wait for a specialist to interpret the
results of a CT-scan.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis also said that although Goldberg had no recollection of
the attack, she had remained conscious throughout the afternoon and
was strong enough to be interviewed by detectives. She had also
been able to talk by telephone with her father in Madison, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has talked with many people, but she is unaware of exactly
what happened, because she was hit from behind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Barrett, Goldberg, 25, was not robbed. Brown said her
handbag was undisturbed on the ground near where she fell. And like
Barrett, Goldberg had no known connection to the man who assaulted
her, the authorities said. As in the earlier assault, the man who
fractured Goldberg's skull ran away and was not immediately
apprehended.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities declined to discuss their investigation in
detail but said that they were seeking a man, believed to be in his
20s to 40s, who was about 5 feet 6 inches tall and 150 pounds, and
was wearing a bright gold shirt at the time of the attack. They
also said the chunk of concrete, apparently from a shattered
sidewalk, was recovered on the street. It weighed 3 to 5 pounds,
the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police supervisors said the investigation's initial focus was on
the homeless, because two witnesses said the man who struck
Goldberg appeared disheveled. Detectives were seen late Sunday at
the nearby Bellevue Men's Shelter. Bernard Samson, a shelter
supervisor, said the police took a man into custody for questioning
Sunday about 5:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The police would not confirm that they had a man in custody, and
said the investigation was following other leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just attacking the homeless, we're looking at many
possibilities,'' McInnis said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the buildings on the block where Goldberg was attacked
have security cameras pointed toward the sidewalks. But the two
cameras at the electrical substation are still being installed and
were not working Sunday, said Sandy Miller, a spokeswoman for the
utility company Con Edison.
</P>
<P>
   However, Miller said, the police had obtained videotape from
another building. ``There's an adjacent building with a camera
working, and I am told that the police have a videotape of the
entire attack,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The police declined to comment about any videotape.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Goldberg, who lives in Manhattan, had moved to New York four
years ago, the police said. She had lived in Brooklyn until
recently and planned to enroll at Columbia University this fall.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday she had attended the 10:30 a.m. service at the Marble
Collegiate Church and lingered afterward for coffee and pastry.
McInnis said she planned to pick up a newspaper and return home by
subway, and was attacked just after leaving the church.
</P>
<P>
   About 12:10 p.m. she was walking on the sidewalk when the man
slammed the concrete into her head. Brown, who arrived seconds
later, described a disturbing scene: a young woman, stylishly
dressed in a blue sleeveless top and black pants, sprawled on the
ground, struggling through the disorientation and blood, trying to
sit up. The firefighter was holding her head. He was calmly urging
her to stay down.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis said that given the severity of the attack, the outcome
was surprising. ``She's conscious,'' he said. ``It appears she's
going to be fine.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mike Piazza got up off the mat and came up swinging _
verbally _ at Roger Clemens Sunday night. To the Mets' catcher,
Clemens committed an unconscionable act on Saturday when the
Yankees right-hander gave Piazza a concussion with a fastball to
the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could remember him as a great pitcher, as a Cy Young
award winner,'' Piazza said. ``But I know I can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza missed Sunday night's game against the Yankees, and he
was unsure if he would play in or even go to Tuesday's All-Star
Game, where he is scheduled to be the starting catcher for the
National League.
</P>
<P>
   He said he felt fine, but also that he was groggy and had a
headache. Very soon, Piazza said he will have a magnetic resonance
imaging test to see if the beaning inflicted any damage to his
brain. ``I consider myself very fortunate that I have at least a
little bit of my faculties today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza prepared some comments before answering questions from
the news media Sunday night, and he said that would be the only
time he would ever address the incident. He had plenty to say, and
in doing so gave voice to a rivalry that now may be more intense
between the teams than it is between fans of those teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about the team,'' said Mets General Manager Steve
Phillips. ``It's not exclusively about an individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips forbid the Yankees from using the weight room in the
Mets' locker room, a facility normally shared between teams. He
also scrapped plans to have Mets all-stars Al Leiter and Edgardo
Alfonzo and their families fly on the Yankees' post-game charter to
Atlanta for the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if things are ever over,'' Phillips said. ``Guys
have long memories in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza was upset not only at Clemens but at other Yankees who
said Clemens was only trying to pitch inside when Piazza was hit in
the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it was definitely intentional,'' Piazza said. ``I
could respect the fact that he's throwing inside, I could respect
the fact of getting hit, getting hit in the ribs or the body. I
know that's part of the game, I accept that and I don't have any
problem with that. But I feel there's a difference between that and
almost ending my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens responded by saying he had no reaction to Piazza's
comments. He repeated what he said after Saturday's game, a 4-2
Yankees victory in the second game of their day-night doubleheader.
``I wasn't trying to hit him,'' Clemens said. ``I was trying to
pitch him inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, who has seven hits _ including three homers _ in 12
at-bats off Clemens, was not buying that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got no remorse,'' said Piazza, who added he had no
interest in accepting Clemens' phone call on Saturday. ``I'm kind
of flattered, in a weird way, because he's trying to tell me the
only way to get me out is to try to hurt me.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza and the Mets manager, Bobby Valentine, both said they
felt Clemens would not have thrown such a pitch at Shea Stadium,
where Clemens would have had to hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't say I have respect for him right now,'' Piazza
said. ``Roger has very good control. I think he only walked one guy
during the game. If the shoe fits, that's the way it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, I want to say this: I thought sometime down the line in
my career maybe I could have been a designated hitter. But I think
that's probably not a good thing for baseball. I think that if he
knew he had to come up the next inning, he probably would have been
a little more careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said he did not remember if Clemens threw at any Texas
Rangers when Valentine managed there _ ``We beat him a lot, I
remember that,'' Valentine said _ but he also noted that Clemens
was protected by the presence of a designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are responsible for your actions and the consequences,''
Valentine said. ``In that American League situation, there's very
little responsibility and very little consequences. So your
teammate gets hit in the butt by an 86 mph fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what the Mets left-hander Glendon Rusch did to Tino
Martinez, the first Yankee he faced Saturday after Piazza was hit.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, of course, was hit in a far more dangerous area, and he
wondered if it would have long-term implications on his career.
Piazza is one of baseball's best hitters, but he said he could not
be sure how he would be affected by the beaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's going to take me a little while to get comfortable
in the box,'' he said. ``You have to deal with it. I've been hit
before and you just put it behind you. You can not do the job if
you're not completely comfortable in the box. If you have one ounce
of anxiety or fear, you're not going to play well.''

<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ Opening the first international
conference on AIDS in a developing country, South African President
Thabo Mbeki Sunday singled out extreme poverty, rather than the
disease ravaging his country and continent, as the leading killer
both here and across Africa.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa is the country with the largest number of people
infected with HIV, the AIDS virus _ 4.2 million _ and its
president, who has become embroiled in international controversy
over the causes of the disease, pledged to intensify his response.
But he dashed the hopes of thousands of participants _ and noisy
protesters _ who wanted to hear him state clearly that HIV causes
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Mbeki skirted the controversy that has arisen because
he has questioned the use of certain drugs in treating HIV, and has
even questioned whether the virus causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many researchers he has contacted in his quest to
understand the epidemic are two U.S. biochemists, Peter Duesberg
and David Rasnick, who argue that poverty and malnutrition, not
HIV, cause AIDS. When word of this consultation became public,
international consternation arose.
</P>
<P>
   As Mbeki described his attempts to understand how one of the
worst epidemics in history has enveloped his country just as it
freed itself from apartheid, he reflected on AIDS and a long list
of other diseases afflicting his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I listened and heard the whole story told about our own
country, it seemed to me that we could not blame everything on a
single virus,'' Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
   The 13th international conference on AIDS is being held as U.N.
officials have been intensifying the alarm about HIV, which infects
34.3 million people in the world, mostly in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after Mbeki finished talking, Dr. Peter Piot, the head
of UNAIDS, a U.N. program that monitors the spread of AIDS, said it
will take at least $3 billion a year to deliver the basic measures
in Africa and tens of billions of dollars more each year to provide
in Africa the standard drugs used to treat the disease in developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The $3 billion figure is ten times what is now being spent in
Africa, Piot said. UNAIDS estimates that 90 percent of people with
HIV do not know they are infected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need billions, not millions, to fight AIDS in the world,''
and ``we can't fight an epidemic of this magnitude with peanuts,''
Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   In news conferences and interviews, Piot said he welcomed a
pledge of $500 million from the World Bank this weekend as a
positive step. He said the remainder needs to come from the
affected African countries and the developed countries.
</P>
<P>
   Piot urged developed countries to cancel the $15 billion in debt
repayment that African countries have incurred each year and return
it so countries can use the money for health care and social
services for AIDS and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   But political will is as important as money in stopping the AIDS
epidemic, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past six years, scientists and AIDS activists have
repeatedly criticized South African leaders for their lack of
leadership in combatting the AIDS epidemic. In 1993, HIV infected 4
percent of South Africa's adult population. Now, it is 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, as conference participants drifted out of the
cricket grounds where Mbeki spoke, many left feeling disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, the majority of South African scientists, would have liked
a clear, unequivocal statement about the relationship between HIV
and AIDS rather than the hints he made,'' said Alan Whiteside, who
heads the AIDS research program at the University of Natal in
Durban.
</P>
<P>
   Whiteside and others said they were encouraged by Mbeki's pledge
to intensify his recently announced program to encourage safe sex
and to sponsor additional research into drug therapy and a possible
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people conducted a protest rally at City Hall hours
before the meeting opened, with Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and
others in the crowd berating the government for failing to speak
frankly about the link between HIV and AIDS and lagging in its
efforts to fight the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   ``AIDS exists, HIV causes AIDS,'' Madikizela-Mandela said. ``We
cannot proclaim this century the African century and then ignore
the AIDS pandemic as some political leaders are.''
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki did speak about the heavy toll of HIV and AIDS on young
people. He also spoke about the toll from malaria, cholera,
syphilis, Vitamin A deficiency, and ``other illnesses with
complicated Latin names'' as among the diseases of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The text of Mbeki's remarks released in advance of his speech
said: ``The world's biggest killer and the greatest cause of ill
health and suffering across the globe, including South Africa, is
extreme poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   When he spoke, he omitted that passage, but referred explicitly
to a 1995 report by the World Health Organization that described
poverty as the world's largest killer. ``Five years later,'' he
added, ``the essential elements of this story have not changed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A strong hint that Mbeki would disappoint most AIDS conference
participants in not saying that HIV causes AIDS came earlier in the
day when scientists canceled a news conference because of what they
said was pressure from the South African government.
</P>
<P>
   The news conference had been scheduled to discuss a statement
signed by 5,000 scientists in the world and known as the Durban
Declaration. It affirmed that scientific evidence supporting the
link between HIV and AIDS is ``clear cut, exhaustive and
unambiguous'' and was published in the July 6 issue of the
scientific journal, Nature, after review by scientific peers.
</P>
<P>
   But the news conference was unexpectedly canceled minutes before
it was to begin. The reason was that ``the South African government
put pressure on us'' and threatened to dismiss any signatory who
worked for the government, said Dr. Charles van der Host, a
professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina who
signed the Durban Declaration.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, van der Host declined to name the government
official who made the call and said the South African scientist who
received it was a representative of the Durban Declaration. The
unidentified official spoke on behalf of Mbeki, van der Host said
he was told.
</P>
<P>
   Tasneem Carrima, a spokesman for Mbeki, denied knowledge of any
such threat. ``We certainly would not threaten anybody,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration came in response to Mbeki's decision to appoint
a panel to review the claims of dissidents who do not believe that
HIV causes AIDS, van der Host said. The panel included such
dissidents and experts who signed the Durban Declaration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought no one would give the denialists credence, and we
were wrong,'' van der Host said.
</P>
<P>
   Van der Host criticized the scientific community for not having
published a summary statement earlier of all the scientific
evidence that HIV causes AIDS. Now, by giving a platform to a small
group of dissidents, Mbeki has helped to divert efforts to fight
AIDS, Van der Host said.
</P>
<P>
   Becoming embroiled in new arguments over the causes of AIDS
diverts attention and resources from finding a solution, several
scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration was intended as a scientific statement because
it was published in a scientific journal, van der Host said.
However, he said, the South African government viewed the
declaration as a political statement. After the declaration was
released last week, Mbeki's spokesman, Parks Mankahlana, said it
should be thrown in the dustbin.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Mbeki's government tempered its stringent criticism
of anti-HIV drug therapy by announcing that it had reversed its
view about AZT, which it had deemed unsafe for pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing his administration's plan to battle AIDS and
responding to critics, Mbeki said ``there is no substance to the
allegation that there is any hesitation on the part of our
government to confront the challenge of HIV/AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   Piot said that underdeveloped countries, though poor, will have
to spend more on AIDS because ``it is about the survival of the
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Mbeki and Piot are leaving the conference early to attend a
meeting of the Organization of African Unity in Lome, Togo, where
AIDS is to be discussed.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MABOLO, Cameroon _ Behind the hills next to this Pygmy village
in the Central African rain forest, a pipeline is to be built in a
few years to carry oil to the Atlantic coast, where it will be
shipped to the West.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline, which the World Bank endorsed in June after heated
debates, will be a huge project, costing $3.7 billion. It
represents a big, risky test for the bank and for African
development policies. Historically, the oil exploitation in Africa
has generated ruinous corruption or long-running wars, not wealth
for nations and their citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In this village, there are both doubts and hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where the oil is coming from and where it's
going,'' said the village chief, Marc Nzie. ``I only know it will
pass behind those hills. If they stay behind those hills, then it's
no problem. We won't hunt there anymore. We'll go the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that in this village, which is without electricity,
``if the pipeline is going to pass behind those hills, they have to
give us light.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the World Bank voted on June 6, the pipeline drew an
unusual level of opposition in the West for an African project.
Human rights and environmental groups had joined forces with
residents here and in neighboring Chad, the two countries the
pipeline would cross.
</P>
<P>
   The underground pipeline is to start in southern Chad, a
landlocked desert nation where oil was discovered three decades ago
but where civil wars and unrest have prevented exploitation,
leaving it one of the poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very interested in working with Chad to find a way of
exploiting these oil resources in a way which would channel these
benefits for the poor and to make a difference in terms of
poverty,'' said Callisto Madavo, the World Bank's vice president
for sub-Saharan Africa. ``The stakes are very high. We should be
able to pull this thing off. But I wasn't born yesterday. There are
risks, and I wouldn't underplay them.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the 665-mile pipeline ends, in Kribi, it will have to
cross the Sahel in Chad, the savanna and mountains of northeastern
Cameroon and the virgin rain forests in the south, where the canopy
of trees is broken only by loggers and Pygmy villages like this
one.
</P>
<P>
   To reach this village near the pipeline route, a traveler has to
follow a footpath that breaks off a dirt road and winds through the
forest up and down muddy hills and across creeks to Mabolo, a
village of 13 mud huts. On one morning, heavy rains had dissuaded
the men from going into the forest to hunt. Many sat together in an
open area.
</P>
<P>
   A knock on the chief's door found him on a bamboo bed, suffering
from malaria. Nzie, in his 50s, is renowned as a healer, but he had
been unable to rid himself of a persistent case of malaria. He
calls it ``Kabila,'' after President Laurent Kabila of Congo, whom
the Rwandans and Ugandans, who are supporting the rebels, have been
unable to oust for two years.
</P>
<P>
   The chief's eldest son, Louis Bitouti, 27, who was building a
toy truck, said many younger Pygmies hoped to get jobs from the
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' asked Bitouti, who like other Pygmies here uses his
grandfather's name as his last name. ``I want to be rich like
everyone else. If I lose my father here, how will I live?''
</P>
<P>
   The villagers founded Mabolo five decades ago, they said, and
with about 50 inhabitants it was one of the biggest Pygmy villages
in the region. Although Pygmies are traditionally nomadic hunters,
the villagers have become somewhat sedentary, continuing to hunt
deep in the forest but also growing cassava and yam.
</P>
<P>
   In this country of 14 million people, the Pygmies, the
indigenous rain forest dwellers, number perhaps 100,000. They have
remained without formal schooling, and few speak French, the
language of the former colonial rulers.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant ethnic groups in Cameroon often discriminate
against the Pygmies. Many Pygmies have been forced out of their
home areas by logging companies and security forces, several human
rights studies report, including the State Department report on
human rights in Cameroon in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   A peaceful people, the Pygmies have, perhaps inevitably, become
a focus of those opposed to the pipeline. The Pygmies may be the
most vulnerable and have the most to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the World Bank will give $200 million in loans
to the Chad and Cameroon governments. The amount is small, given
the cost of the project, which will be borne mostly by the oil
companies involved in the joint venture, Exxon Mobil, which would
have 40 percent; Chevron, another American company, 25 percent; and
a Malaysian company, Petronas, 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank support is far more important to the companies
than its financial contribution. Many diplomats in the region say
they believe that the companies would have withdrawn and that Chad
would have turned to other partners, perhaps Libya, if the bank had
not voted yes.
</P>
<P>
   In the last quarter of a century, the western African coast
between Nigeria and Angola has become one of the hottest spots for
oil exploration. But the Western multinational companies have come
under increasing criticism for their practices, especially Royal
Dutch Shell in Nigeria and Elf Aquitaine in Gabon and the Congo
Republic, whose capital is Brazzaville.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not one example in Africa where oil has led to
development,'' said Samuel Nguiffo, secretary general of the Center
for the Environment and Development, a leading environmental
organization here. ``Look at Nigeria, Angola, the two Congos,
Gabon. They all have an overabundance of oil, and what do they have
to show for it?
</P>
<P>
   ``We can even say that the exploitation of oil has retarded
their development. What are the chances that things will be any
different in Chad or Cameroon?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in the capital, Yaounde, where he was visiting
officials, Madavo said he was aware of the history of oil here. He
said he was also aware that Chad had a poor human rights record and
that Transparency International, an organization based in Berlin
that studies corruption, had ranked it the most corrupt country for
two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very, very important that the World Bank, as an economic
institution, not become so risk averse that it would only do the
sure thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Early in June, the bank decided to proceed with the biggest
project that it has been associated with in Africa. In Washington,
officials at the State and Commerce Departments backed the plan.
Their counterparts at the Agency for International Development and
the Environmental Protection Agency, concerned about how the oil
revenues would be spent and the pipeline's environmental effects,
opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement with the bank, Chad agreed to a spending
plan for its oil revenues, with 80 percent for education, health,
social services, rural development and infrastructure; 10 percent
to be kept in a trust for the future; and 5 percent earmarked for
development in the oil-producing region of Doba. The last 5 percent
would be discretionary.
</P>
<P>
   In Chad, where 80 percent of the 7 million inhabitants live on
less than $1 a day, the oil revenues would amount to up to half of
the national budget. Oil money is widely expected to start flowing
in four years and to last for 25 years, for a total of $2 billion.
The government has pledged to respect its part of the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will not be any place for predators of oil revenues,''
President Idriss Deby said in a speech after the bank had voted.
``We will make sure that every centime from oil will produce a
positive effect in the life of every Chadian family.''
</P>
<P>
   The money that Cameroon would derive is estimated at $500
million, or 3 percent of the national budget. Concerns in this
country center more on the ecological effects, because many
environmental groups contend that the huge oil companies have used
substandard controls while exploiting oil in places like the Niger
Delta in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Didier Amougou, an official at Planet Survey, a Cameroonian
environmental organization, said groups like his had shifted from
opposing the project to trying to ensure that it would be properly
built and managed. He said his group would also try to make certain
that those affected by the construction would receive fair
compensation, especially the Pygmies, who are dominated by Bantus
in the rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the Pygmies, we are the white men,'' said Dieudonne Mbuel,
37, a Bantu, explaining how the Bantus had seized most of the rain
forest from Pygmies.
</P>
<P>
   Mbuel, who lives in a nearby Bantu village, Madoungou, said he
had received $500 from the joint venture because the pipeline is
expected to pass through his land. He expected more.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see this mango tree?'' he asked, standing in the thick of
the forest and pointing to a tree taller than the others. ``They'll
have to compensate me for that.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the Pygmies interviewed have received any compensation,
although some are eventually supposed to under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Not too far away, in Ndamayo, Jean Bikanda, a Pygmy, said he did
not believe that he would ever receive any money for the pipeline.
Several months ago, loggers ripped through the forest, creating a
road just in front of his house. He received no compensation, he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Asked his age, Bikanda stood up in his hut and opened a nylon
bag that was hanging in a corner. He took out his identity card,
which most people in Cameroon have. But he was one of the few
Pygmies interviewed who had one. Born in 1938, the card read,
``Profession: Chasseur.'' Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   The prey that Bikanda hunts _ rats, porcupines, rabbits, boars
and antelopes _ fled deeper into the forest because of the loggers,
he said. ``Maybe we will get work from this pipeline,'' he added.
``Maybe this will be good for Cameroon.''
</P>
<P>
   But his son Pierre Mbang, 34, said: ``Work is good, but the
forest is our life. Work is good, but it will end.''
</P>
<P>
   The son was unsure what to make of the World Bank decision.
``That's where all the money in the world is kept,'' he said of the
bank, reinforcing the distance between bank decisions and life on
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Madavo, the bank vice president, who is from Zimbabwe, was
hopeful. ``If it succeeds,'' he said, ``wouldn't that be wonderful
for a story to be written 20 years from now, that on an issue where
there was a lot of doubt and skepticism, that the World Bank stood
up, did its homework, supported something that made a tremendous
difference to Africa? I would love to be alive to see that.''

NOW, DODGERS ENVY ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If a friend had told you back in April that the Los Angeles
Dodgers would envy the Anaheim Angels at the all-star break, you
would have helped your buddy find counseling.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have never, ever had a single reason to envy their
little baseball brothers, the team Walter O'Malley allowed to play
at Dodger Stadium for four years (1962-65). The Dodgers have won
six World Series. The Angels have watched 39.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the snide little war between megalomaniac owners
(Fox, Disney), the Dodgers generally are indifferent to the Angels,
while the Angels are just indifferent, period.
</P>
<P>
   But at the traditional all-star break, here are four reasons why
the Dodgers should feel something about the Angels:
</P>
<P>
   1. The Angels, despite losing their best pitcher during the
offseason to free agency (Chuck Finley) and two veteran pitchers
during the season to injury (Ken Hill, Tim Belcher), have a better
record. The Angels are 47-41 and just swept Colorado. The Dodgers
are 44-42 and were shutout in their last two games before the
break.
</P>
<P>
   2. While the Dodgers are the ones who lean on their tradition,
it is the Angels that are managed by a blueblood, Mike Scioscia.
Eighty-eight games into his managing career, he seems to have
bought a touch of the old Dodger (set ital) familia (end) to the
Anaheim clubhouse, replacing the ennui of past generations.
</P>
<P>
   3. While the Dodger pitching theme is ``Park and Brown and
reason to frown,'' a tattered staff of journeymen or worse, the
Angels suddenly have all these promising twentysomething pitchers
jockeying for innings.
</P>
<P>
   4. Where the Dodgers have been putting out one fire after
another, all hot spots descended from the Mike Piazza fireball, the
Angels appear to have a plan.
</P>
<P>
   One makes this last point cautiously, because it would be wrong
for anyone to believe that the good folk at Disney have put a lot
of thought into how their baseball team performs on the field. In
the Disney corporate world, the Angels are merely a division of
their amusement holdings, and not exactly an E ticket. They're more
``Mr. Toad's Wild Ride'' than ``Matterhorn.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, former General Manager Bill Bavasi had a plan, too -- sign
homegrown players to longterm contracts, avoid arbitration -- and
it failed to produce a division title or keep him employed.
</P>
<P>
   But there does seem to be some de facto policy at work in
Anaheim. Disney has gone through all of the typical machinations of
modern baseball management -- build a new (or renovated) park,
invest in a free agent (Mo Vaughn), dispatch upper management
(Bavasi, Terry Collins), shake up the clubhouse (Finley, Jim
Edmonds) -- and settled into letting baseball nature take its
course.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not necessarily a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Angels are healthier than they were a year ago, and you
knew they would be simply because just about everyone was hurt at
some point in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil of the clubhouse a year ago has dissipated. One can
argue long into the night whether Edmonds and Collins got a raw
deal, but it doesn't matter anymore. They're gone and the clubhouse
dynamic is different.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia has everyone's focus directed on the field, the kind of
thing one expected from the former Dodger catcher, Iron Mike, who
had a quiet work ethic and who guarded the plate with his life. No
one in the clubhouse has to wonder what Scioscia expects of them,
and if they meet that standard, they're not going to spend a lot of
time in his office.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are all the distractions and debris of '99. The Angels
strength in 2000 is that no one is wondering who will get traded or
fired (no one will) or if management will add a free agent down the
stretch (not a chance).
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Angels can hang in a pennant race with the
surprisingly successful Seattle Mariners and Oakland A's is the
question of the summer. But they look a lot like those two teams
ahead of them, reason enough to think they might compete next
summer if not this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have survived quite nicely without Ken Griffey, not
to mention Randy Johnson. They rebuilt their pitching staff around
what they got from Houston (John Halama, Freddy Garcia) when they
traded The Unit under free agent duress, and it is now deep and
young. While the Reds have sunk under the weight of
Griffey-inspired expectations, the Mariners are playing loose and
good.
</P>
<P>
   The A's, meanwhile, endorsed the same policy Bavasi and several
other teams have taken in the wake of the Yankees, Dodgers and
Orioles spreading money around like manure. They built around
products of the farm system, put together a budget with a bit of
flexibility, and were patient.
</P>
<P>
   It's a notable statement that the teams considered to have the
brightest futures are those that invested in their farm system and
have embraced young pitching as the key component.
</P>
<P>
   Take away Hill and Belcher (who happen to have two of the
highest ERAs on the team) and the Angel pitching staff looks like a
day care center.
</P>
<P>
   There are ex-Trojans Brian Cooper (25) and Seth Etherton (23),
Dominican Ramon Ortiz (24), and lefthanders Scott Schoeneweis (26)
and Jarrod Washburn (25). Derrick Turnbow, a neat Rule V claim by
new G.M. Bill Stoneman, is just 22. He pitched last year in A ball.
Combined, they are 19-13 on the season.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn has an ERA under 4.00, an astonishing achievement in
the current beer league softball atmosphere in the A.L.
</P>
<P>
   Behind them in the farm system are former Fullerton star Matt
Wise, St. John Bosco product Mark Harriger, and Matt Beaumont and
Steve Green. Plus, Jason Dickson, should he ever regain his health,
and Mike Holtz are just 27.
</P>
<P>
   And thanks to Bavasi's foresight, Stoneman has a workable
budget, with a nucleus of players under contract, and no apparent
holes outside of the one currently vacated by injured shortstop
Gary DiSarcina.
</P>
<P>
   It may not produce a playoff spot in 2000, but at least the
Angels can look down the road with some hope. Give it a year, and
maybe the Dodgers look down the freeway with envy.
</P>

EARLY PIONEER WINS HOLLYWOOD GOLD CUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART WILSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. -- David and Holly Wilson had just finished
watching a replay of their 5-year-old gelding, Early Pioneer,
winning Sunday's $1 million Hollywood Gold Cup when victorious
trainer Vladimir Cerin arrived at the postrace press conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won again, Vladimir,'' David Wilson joked.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's winning team of jockey Victor Espinoza, Cerin and the
Wilsons is laughing all the way to the bank after the 24-1 long
shot collared favored General Challenge midway through the stretch
and posted a one- length victory in front of an on-track crowd of
29,151 at Hollywood Park, giving both Espinoza and Cerin their
first Grade I wins.
</P>
<P>
   The winner's share of $600,000 increased the Wilsons' earnings
to more than $1 million since they claimed Early Pioneer for
$62,500 at Santa Anita in October 1998. The son of Rahy has won 6
of 19 races since the claim, including the Grade II San Bernardino
Handicap in April at 26-1.
</P>
<P>
   The winning time for the 1 miles on dirt was an unspectacular
2:01 2/5, but there is nothing ordinary about Early Pioneer's
success since being switched from sprint to route races during the
past Santa Anita meet.
</P>
<P>
   Early Pioneer has three victories and three seconds in six races
since the change. Matt Garcia was aboard for the first five, but
the meet's leading rider, Espinoza, got the call Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make the change myself and I explained it to
Matt,'' Cerin said. ``It was a difficult thing to do because I like
Matt, I respect him, and I was taking a good mount from him. But I
felt Victor would fit the horse a little bit better.''
</P>
<P>
   Espinoza fit him like a glove, settling Early Pioneer back into
sixth place as pacesetter David went the first half-mile in :46
2/5. The winner was third, behind David and General Challenge,
after a 1:34 4/5 mile and then finished strongly for his ninth
lifetime victory in 31 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I turned for home, General Challenge was done. I knew I
had it,'' Espinoza said. ``I only worried about (Eddie)
Delahoussaye's horse (Out of Mind). I know that sometimes he is
coming like a rocket. But I never saw him.''
</P>
<P>
   For the 45-year-old Cerin, the victory was the pinnacle of a
steady, yet unspectacular career. His biggest victory before Sunday
came in a couple of $300,000 races.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's joined the trainers' millionaire club, along with the
likes of Bob Baffert, D. Wayne Lukas, Ronald McAnally and Richard
Mandella.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it means yet,'' Cerin said. ``I've never won
one before, so I'll have to assess it. It's nice to be surrounded
by friends and people I like.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert and jockey Corey Nakatani thought General Challenge's
three- month layoff was a major factor in the 4-year-old gelding's
second consecutive defeat. Nakatani said he placed his mount closer
to the pace than in his most recent races because ``fresh horses
tend to be a little keener in a race.''
</P>
<P>
   After General Challenge, it was another 1 lengths back to
third-place finisher David. Out of Mind was fourth, followed by Cat
Thief, Blueprint, Chester House, Big Ten and Pleasant Breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Early Pioneer and General Challenge will likely square off again
in the $1 million Pacific Classic on Aug. 26 at Del Mar, according
to both horses' connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gonna go home and get a good night's rest, then I'll
call Mr. and Mrs. Wilson in the morning and tell them he came out
of the race in great shape, I hope,'' Cerin said. ``We'll wait four
or five days before we make any decision and we'll do it together.
That (Pacific Classic) would be in our plans, I guess that would be
on top of my list, but we'll take a vote and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Espinoza won twice Sunday, raising his meet-leading victory
total to 49. Five of the victories have come in stakes races.''

<P>
   Alma Rose Tejeda opened the black backpack to find out what was
inside. She was looking for a name, address or phone number that
might help her locate the owner.
</P>
<P>
   Tejeda found the information, as well as a camera, some money
and a plastic bag filled with what looked like dirt. She considered
tasting it to find out what it was, but inexplicably pulled her
hand back.
</P>
<P>
   Several days later, Tejeda, a customer service representative
with Washington state's Seattle-Tacoma airport's Lost and Found,
discovered the bag contained what was left of someone's Uncle
Charlie.
</P>
<P>
   The man's ashes were supposed to have been scattered at sea, but
had been left at the airport by a woman from the East Coast who had
lost her backpack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen a dead person in my life. It still gives me
the chills,'' Tejeda said. ``But it always gives me a good feeling
to return something special.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Sea-Tac Lost and Found, which returns
approximately one-third of more than 12,000 found items each year,
will be on the receiving end of good news.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey, conducted by Michael Franz, of Washington State
University's small business development center, found Sea-Tac's
Lost and Found to be one of the best in the country at reuniting
frantic travelers with their glasses, purses, luggage _ and even
``Uncle Charlie.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington Works, which runs the Lost and Found, was pleasantly
surprised to find its two-year-old job-training site out-performing
its conventional counterparts at other airports surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Works, under a contract with the Port of Seattle,
uses the Lost and Found as a ``managed work site'' for people in
its Welfare-to-Wages program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hoping we were doing well, but we had no idea how we
stacked up, industry-wide,'' said Thomas Donlea, executive director
of the non-profit agency.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Works originally approached Franz for advice on how
to improve business practices at the Lost and Found. As part of
that process, Franz conducted a survey to see how Sea-Tac measured
up.
</P>
<P>
   The competition: Airports in Los Angeles, Portland, Minneapolis,
Miami, Dallas-Ft. Worth, Ft. Lauderdale and St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Sea-Tac was found to provide the highest level of customer
service, to handle the highest volume of lost items, to put the
most energy into locating owners and returning items and to have
zero thefts or complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Works said the findings debunk myths about the work
ethic of employees who are on welfare, or who lack job experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't see the potential because of the stigma,'' said
Dennis Hatch, Sea-Tac Lost and Found's operations manager. ``Some
of the folks here who are offering our high level of service have
only been here for two months.''
</P>
<P>
   Tejeda, 35, has worked at the Lost and Found for nearly a year.
The part-time job helps the California native support her four
children and disabled husband.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to finding Washington Works, Tejeda had not held a job for
11 years. Now she has customer service skills, knowledge of
Windows, e-mail and the Internet _ and a lot more confidence.
</P>
<P>
   When Tejeda's stint at the Lost and Found ends next month, she
plans to finish school and get her GED.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very extra patient here about showing me
everything,'' Tejeda said. ``I love (this job). I enjoy every
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Encinas feels the same way.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, Encinas waited for someone to approach
her window at the Lost and Found _ tucked away up the stairs behind
the Continental Airlines counter, down the hall past cases
displaying the work of local glass artists and around the corner
from the Meditation Room.
</P>
<P>
   A red canvas case sat on Encinas' lap. It contained a fishing
pole, but no name or address. Encinas zipped the case up and
started entering the item into a computer database.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men always come back for their fishing poles,'' the
28-year-old said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the owners do come looking, but sometimes those in the
department have to do some detective work to find them.
</P>
<P>
   By tracing a credit card receipt number, Tejeda once located a
man who had lost a suitcase full of new clothes _ and $300 cash.
</P>
<P>
   The staffers don't accept any rewards, however. Not even for the
$8,747 recently returned to one traveler, or the 50-year-old
heirloom wedding band returned to another.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we do get lots of thank yous,'' Hatch said. ``Lots of
e-mails, phone calls ... it just feels good.''
</P>
<P>
   The office's back room is packed with items still to be
returned. A pile in one corner is the sad remains of things turned
in during May, about to be donated to non-profits to make space for
the 1,500 lost items expected in July.
</P>
<P>
   A framed John Elway poster crowns the donation pile. Around the
corner, a single, baby-sized white sandal sits alone in a cubby. A
dinosaur puppet lays next to a red squirt gun.

extinct by now, replaced by sleek LCD flat-panel displays if not
some newer and even better technology.

 BIOSCOPE: ORIGEN NOT CHICKENHEARTED ABOUT BIOENGINEERING  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Robert Kay has a new twist to the old riddle
about the chicken and the egg. As chief executive of Origen
Therapeutics in Burlingame, Calif., Kay knows that birds begin life
as embryos, and he hopes to parlay that knowledge into a technique
that could change the future of chicken-kind.
</P>
<P>
   For those whose familiarity with fowl husbandry comes from the
new claymation movie ``Chicken Run,'' an overview of the chicken
industry is the prerequisite for appreciating the boldness of Kay's
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with the numbers. Each year, Kay said, Americans
consume some 10 billion chickens. When the rest of the world gets
factored in, the annual appetite hits 38 billion birds.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve these volumes, chicken production has become a
specialized industry that begins with the Big Three _ two breeding
firms in the United States and a third in Britain. Between them,
they breed billions of chicks that they sell to the farmers who
raise them into the birds we eat.
</P>
<P>
   For the really big farms, the ones that raise 50 million birds a
year, time is money. They try to grow their flocks from chick size
to market size _ which is about 4.5 pounds _ as quickly as possible
to minimize their main costs of providing feed and removing waste.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the Big Three have focused on breeding birds that fatten up
in as little as 42 days. And they strive to continue bringing that
number down by developing breeds that bulk up faster.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kay, however, traditional breeding techniques are
starting to hit some limits. For instance, when breeders select
birds that grow fatter faster, these birds tend to be duds at
laying eggs. Meat industry breeders aren't interested in eggs as
products. But they do need to make sure that their meat birds can
lay enough eggs to create flocks large enough to serve the 38
billion-bird market.
</P>
<P>
   So the breeders must compromise, Kay said, making sure their
newest meat birds retain some egg-laying skills, even though this
might mean a sacrifice in their time-to-market traits.
</P>
<P>
   But what if there was a way to have the best of both worlds, to
create a breed that reached market weight in record time, but also
had a high egg-laying potential, so breeders could quickly supply
farmers with billions of these new super-birds?
</P>
<P>
   That is where biotechnology comes in.
</P>
<P>
   Return, for a moment, to the fertilized chicken egg. Imagine
peering through the shell, past the egg white to the tiny embryo,
about the size of a match head, that floats on the yellow yolk.
</P>
<P>
   In laboratory experiments, Robert Etches, Origen's chief
scientist, has removed embryonic cells from one breed of chicken
and injected them into the embryo of a different breed. The process
is akin to cloning.
</P>
<P>
   When this experimental technique works _ which Origen says is
about one out of 10 tries _ the result is a chicken that gets many
of its traits from the injected embryo. So far, the company has
focused on showing visible traits, such as feather color. It is
trying to boost its success rate, especially in assuring that the
desired trait _ fast weight gain _ ends up being dominant.
</P>
<P>
   Experimental though it may be, Kay thinks this technique can
eliminate the compromise between fast egg laying and fast meat
growth. Say breeders had their best laying hens lay billions of
eggs, creating huge flocks in record time. Of course, left alone
the eggs from these hens would create scrawny chickens that were
good at laying eggs but lousy at making meat.
</P>
<P>
   But Origen wouldn't leave those eggs alone. It would inject the
eggs with embryonic tissue from birds bred to maximize meat
production, at the expense of egg laying ability. Chickens would be
specialized as never before. The layers would do all the laying,
and biotech would come in at the factory level to zap all those
billions of eggs with embryonic tissue from the best meat-growers
that science could devise.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, the whole idea of meat production is to get the time
from chick to market weight down from 42 days to as brief a time as
technically feasible. Kay thinks this technique could do just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``And how are we going to do this on a billion-bird scale?'' Kay
said, anticipating my question.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that a North Carolina firm, Embrex Inc., is already
injecting vaccines into billions of chicken eggs annually, to
inoculate the birds against diseases that might otherwise decimate
flocks and cripple production. (See the process at
 &LR; www.embrex.com &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Origen and Embrex announced an agreement to
co-develop Kay's high-tech chicken breeding process. Origen will
provide the biotech know-how, and Embrex will contribute the
industrial injection smarts.
</P>
<P>
   Even Kay, who has to be optimistic, thinks it will take three to
five years to solve the myriad technical challenges ahead, not the
least of which is making sure that the needles hit the embryos,
unerringly, 30 or 40 billion times a year.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Kay succeeds or fails, the larger point is that every
aspect of food production is moving in the same direction, pushing
the limits of traditional breeding by using a variety of genetic
engineering techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Wary of the controversy around genetically engineered foods, Kay
emphasized that his process would not add any non-chicken genes. He
simply hopes to clone the ideal meat chick on an industrial scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to make full disclosure on a label to let the consumer
decide,'' Kay said, aware that his plans will make some people
uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   And no wonder. The bioengineered corn on the market today sounds
tame alongside the foods on the drawing board; salmon and tomatoes
genetically tweaked to grow large; eggs bioengineered to lessen
artery-clogging cholesterols; rice altered at the genetic level to
address vitamin deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these may be good ideas, and others bad. But I feel
uneasy about the fact that a breed of hairless apes, not all that
far removed from the days when their kind dined on wooly mammoths
and wild berries, now wields an exponentially increasing power to
hack into the genetic code, to superimpose its profit needs on 4
billion years of nature's handiwork.
</P>
<P>
   Yet I don't see the alternative. Oh, I could quit barbecuing
chicken, but I don't think that would solve the underlying problem
that your modern Homo Sapiens want their bellies filled, cheaply
and conveniently, and would resist the sort of social reengineering
it would take to migrate them from their comfortable city jobs to
the chore-filled green acres.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the more I think about it, the more I wonder which side
of the barbed wire we're on in this Chicken Run world.

 ONLINE INVESTING: SCREENING PROGRAMS PROVIDE INVESTING IDEAS  &HT;     By HARRY DOMASH 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There isn't any magic behind successful
investing. You get there by building a list of suitable investment
candidates and picking the best prospects from it.
</P>
<P>
   What's suitable? That depends on your style. Investors tend to
fall into three categories:
</P>
<P>
   -- Value or contrarian investors are attracted to stocks
currently out of favor with the market.
</P>
<P>
   -- Growth investors look for companies with strong sales and
earnings growth prospects.
</P>
<P>
   -- Momentum players want to stick to stocks in a strong upward
trend.
</P>
<P>
   You can be successful following any of these approaches if you
do it right. In this column, I'll show you how to use screening to
find a list of growth stock candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Internet screening programs are a prolific source for investing
ideas. You can use them to scan through the entire market in
seconds to find stocks that meet your requirements. The trick is
deciding what to look for. Through time, I've developed a list of
screening criteria that gives me investment candidates worthy of
further research. I'll describe how this works, and while I'm at
it, I'll explain how to use a screening program.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover's Stock Screener is one of my favorite screening programs
because it's powerful and easy to use.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover's business is compiling information about public and
privately held companies. Some of the information on its site
requires a subscription, but you can use the screener for free. You
can get to Hoover's screener from its home page  &LR; www.hoovers.com &LR; ,
but it's easier to go directly to the screener
 &LR; www.stockscreener.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Hoover's program provides 22 screening variables (parameters),
but we'll use only a few. You can enter nothing, a minimum value, a
maximum value, or both, for each screening variable.
</P>
<P>
   Let's get started.
</P>
<P>
   The Industry Group dropdown menu enables you to limit your
search to major industries such as Computer Hardware, or to
specific sectors within an industry such as Networking and
Communications Devices.
</P>
<P>
   Use the default ``All Industries'' selection for now. Later,
after you've gained some experience, you can experiment and narrow
your search to companies in potentially hot industries.
</P>
<P>
   Current P/E, in the Ratios section, defines the minimum and
maximum price-to-earnings ratio you're willing to accept. Stocks
with high P/E ratios are considered risky, while those with low
ratios are said to be value-priced and lower-risk investments. I'm
suggesting the unthinkable and asking you to leave this section
blank in favor of Price/ Revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Price/Revenue is similar to P/E except the stock price is
divided by sales per share instead of earnings per share. Many
consider P/R a better measure of value than P/E because reported
earnings are subject to a multitude of arbitrary accounting
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Set the P/R minimum to 3 (below 3 is value-priced stocks) and
the maximum to 10 (higher is momentum). Current Ratio compares
current assets to short-term debt. CR is greater than 1.0 when
current assets exceed short-term debt, and less than 1.0 when the
debt is greater than the assets.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a CR of 3.0 means assets are three times debt, and
a CR of 0.5 means the debt is twice the assets. You want more
assets than debt, so set the minimum CR to 1.5 and leave the
maximum blank. Consider raising your minimum CR requirement to 2.0
if your screen produces too many hits.
</P>
<P>
   One-Year Revenue, in the Growth Rates section, allows you to
specify your sales growth requirements for the past 12 months. Set
the minimum to 20 percent, and increase it later if your screen
gets too many hits. Leave the maximum value blank.
</P>
<P>
   One-Year Earnings specifies earnings growth in the most recent
12 months. Ideally, you want to see earnings growing as quickly as
sales, but that doesn't always happen. Set your minimum earning
growth about 5 percent less than your sales growth.
</P>
<P>
   Market Value, in the Company Size section, defines the
acceptable market capitalization. Set the minimum to 1000 million
(no comma) if you want to avoid higher-risk small companies.
</P>
<P>
   Operating Margin, in the Margins section, is a measure of
earnings before deducting income taxes, interest and expenses not
related to the company's main business. Companies with the highest
margins often are the best performers for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   Specify 10 percent minimum operating margin unless you're
looking for retail stores. In that case, you may have to reduce the
minimum to 7 or 8 percent to find enough candidates. Try raising
the minimum operating margin to 15 percent (not retail) if your
screen results in too many hits.
</P>
<P>
   Now, click on ``Go'' near the bottom to run the screen. Hoover's
displays a list of companies meeting your screening requirements,
20 to a page.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the company name, Hoover's displays the value of
each of the variables you've used in the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The companies initially are listed in alphabetical order, but
you can sort the listing using any of your variables by clicking on
the column heading. For instance, you can list the companies with
the highest operating margins at the top by clicking on the
Operating Margin column heading.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, your list should contain between 10 and 20 companies.
Your first screening attempts will probably result in too few hits
or too many. If that happens, adjust the screening criteria to
bring your results within an acceptable ran'.7+wu;9tq}a &QL; nSiWg &QL; v1

 &HT;    DRIVERS SEE RED AT LONG STOPLIGHTS(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By Laura Trujillo(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the crowded intersection of Grand Avenue, Thomas Road and
27th Avenue, Lee Chase sees what a lingering red stoplight leads
to.
</P>
<P>
   There's a woman putting on mascara, a man eating a hamburger, a
teenager talking on a cell phone and a couple who appear to be
arguing. A guy in a Toyota has his windows unrolled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Must not have air,'' Chase observes from the office of the
Ugly Duckling used car lot where he works.
</P>
<P>
   And when the light grows too long, and impatience too short, he
sees some drivers cut through his parking lot rather than wait.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the light {ndash} at one minute and 50 seconds during
rush hour - is one of the longest reds in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also true that red lights everywhere are getting
longer.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic engineers say wider streets require longer light cycles.
So as the city grows, so do the red lights.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, many Chandler intersections had 50-second
waits; now they are 80. Where the wait was 30 seconds in the
mid-1960s in Phoenix, it's now 60 seconds. Lights along Grand
Avenue in Peoria now run up to a whopping three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The increase is not unique to this Valley of wide streets, lots
of left-hand turn lanes and even more cars. Across the nation,
engineers are lengthening traffic signals. In the past 30 years,
the length of red lights has doubled at many intersections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going on everywhere. Las Vegas is crazy with almost
three-minute reds at some spots,'' said Nazir Lalani, former
president of the International Traffic Engineers. ``As we widen
streets and go to the double left, unfortunately it drives up the
cycle and the red light.''
</P>
<P>
   Longer lights, engineers explain, can help move traffic more
efficiently. That's because with a longer cycle, you have a smaller
percentage of time devoted to the yellow (four seconds at some
intersections) or the overlapping reds (add another four seconds in
some places). Lalani points out that wider streets also require
more time for pedestrians to cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traffic engineers aren't sitting here trying to figure out
ways to make the red lights longer,'' said Lalani, a traffic
engineer in Ventura, Calif. ``But doing the mathematics requires
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many cities increase traffic light times during rush hour. So
while you might wait 60 seconds at an intersection around noon, you
could wait 80 seconds during the evening commute.
</P>
<P>
   Although some say the longer red lights encourage people to run
the yellow or the red, and Phoenix leads the nation in red-light
accidents, Alberto Gutier of the Governor's Office of Highway
Safety says the longer reds really do make streets safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives people more time to cross these wide streets,'' he
said, ``and if it helps move traffic, it's a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Try explaining that to Bryan Lubash as he waits in his Chevrolet
Cavalier delivery car, air-conditioner blasting, at a Mesa
intersection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it feels like you can wait forever,'' said Lubash,
29, a driver for Home Office Express. He can check his maps, his
delivery schedule and make a phone call before many of the lights
change during his morning route.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the longest waits occur at the intersections of small
streets with bigger ones. The small streets get the red light 90
percent of the time, said Jerry Whelpley, Glendale's traffic signal
supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no matter what you do, they all say it's way too long,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the guy who sees the cup as half-full.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to remember, if your red is longer, that means
someone's green is longer,'' pointed out Steve Ramsey, signal
systems analyst for Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Yolanda Romero, who drives Grand Avenue almost daily taking her
mother to doctor's appointments or on errands, says she tries to
remind herself of that when she's stopped at a long red light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to be ready for it,'' the 41-year-old from Surprise
said. ``I can check out all the radio stations. I don't have a
phone so that's it. You just wait. Unless the train comes, then
forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix and state traffic engineers agree that the triple
intersections along Grand Avenue are bad. The Arizona Department of
Transportation is designing bridges to get rid of the triple
intersections starting in 2003, which would cut red lights by
almost one minute in some spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just no way around it,'' said Matt Burdick, an ADOT
spokesman, ``when you have traffic from six ways, you're going to
wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at the Ugly Ducking, Chase watches the traffic and knows
he'll soon be in it.
</P>
<P>
   But the car salesman maintains a sort of Zenlike attitude about
it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just turn on the talk radio,'' he said. ``And I figure it's
another moment I can sit back and enjoy my time.''

A LOOK BACK AT BIGGEST WOMEN'S EVENT EVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRENTWOOD, Calif. _ Many great accomplishments start with a pen
and piece of paper.
</P>
<P>
   Marla P. Messing, president of the 1999 Women's World Cup
Organizing Committee, worked night and day coordinating what many
consider the biggest women's sporting event in history.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Sports Illustrated article, the magazine estimated
that one billion people worldwide watched the 1999 summer event,
which turned 20 American soccer players into sports icons.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago today, the United States beat China 5-4 on penalty
kicks to win the Women's World Cup championship at the Rose Bowl.
That drama unfolded after the two teams remained scoreless through
120 minutes of regulation and overtime. The game was played in
front of 90,125 fans and a national television audience of more
than 40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Messing is now a full-time mom living in Brentwood with her
husband Brett and daughters Natalie, 3, and Samantha Rose, 2. She
recalls the day in 1997 when 1994 World Cup president Alan
Rothenberg agreed to allow the little-known Messing to draw up the
business plan for the WWC.
</P>
<P>
   Messing said she locked herself in an office for three months.
She was pregnant with Samantha Rose, doing Lamaze exercises one
moment and figuring out budgets, licensing and venue locations the
next. She was at her desk writing the evening before Samantha Rose
was born. After giving birth, she was back in her office within two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back, it's extremely rewarding to write a business
plan, put it on paper, spend three years hammering away and then
see it come to fruition,'' Messing said. ``There are very few
opportunities in life to create and build something this huge. To
watch it unfold the way it unfolded, I don't know if I'll ever be a
part of something that special again.''
</P>
<P>
   Messing, a graduate of the University of Michigan, also holds a
juris doctorate from the University of Chicago. She began her
professional career at Lathan &AMP; Watkins, one of the preeminent law
firms in the country. She specialized in corporate and security
matters.
</P>
<P>
   It was there Messing met Rothenberg, who convinced her to leave
the firm to join the 1994 USA World Cup Organizing Committee in
1992. Messing was the executive vice president in charge of all
World Cup business operations, including ticketing, entertainment
and special events. Under her direction, the '94 World Cup sold 3.5
million tickets - the largest number of tickets ever sold for a
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Following the USA World Cup '94, Messing joined the initial
management team which oversaw the launch of Major League Soccer in
1996. She used all that experience when she was named president of
Women's World Cup `99, a much tougher task than running the
tradition-rich men's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's World Cup was relatively new. It started in 1991 in
China, averaging attendance of 19,615 for 26 matches. In 1995 in
Sweden, attendance plummeted to an average of only 4,316.
</P>
<P>
   At the FIFA draw in San Francisco, Messing came under criticism
when she decided to use big venues such as Giants Stadium, Soldier
Field and the Rose Bowl instead of more realistic smaller sites.
After all, who would watch a match between Nigeria and North Korea
or Brazil and Mexico? Most observers thought she was crazy, but
Messing wasn't swayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of skepticism, but I always believed in the
event,'' Messing said. ``We had two choices - either fill stadiums
of 5,000 and 10,000 seats or go for it all. We went for it all and
the sponsors backed us.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team averaged more than 68,000 a game. For all 34
matches, the WWC averaged 22,359 per game, shattering all
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember sitting at Giants Stadium for the opening game
feeling really nervous,'' Messing said. ``Then the stadium started
filling up, the electricity was in the air and before I knew it,
there were 80,000 people around me. I was thinking, most of these
people never heard of the Women's World Cup six months earlier. It
was very fulfilling.''
</P>
<P>
   That match grabbed the attention of the national media, which
kept building up the event until it hit epic proportions. Suddenly,
Messing was in the middle of the summer's biggest sports craze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to remember, it was the personality of the
U.S. team that captured the imagination of the American public. We
laid the groundwork, but they made it a huge event,'' Messing said.
``But what you realize and what we hoped was true ... people always
want to see the best of the best in any sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at track and field. It doesn't get much attention,
but every four years at the Olympic Games it has the attention of
the world. That was kind of our vision for the Women's World Cup.
We knew if we stayed true to the event and offered the best of
women's soccer, people would support it, especially with the U.S.
team a prohibitive favorite.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Messing basked in the glory and began to
realize what she had pulled off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'll ever have that feeling again,'' Messing
said. ``We had the President and First Lady in the quarterfinals,
then Mr. Clinton came again to the final.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After the tournament, we're doing a conference on the South
Lawn of the White House with the White House music playing. We come
marching out and are greeted by President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore. I mean, it felt like an out-of-body experience.
It was surreal that this event that was so small months earlier
grew to this magnitude.''

MARINERS SITTING PRETTY AT BREAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ This is not where the Mariners figured to be, sitting
in first place at the All-Star break, owning a three-game lead in
the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland was supposed to be the team to beat. Texas was the
two-time defending West champion.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle? Just another team with dreams.
</P>
<P>
   But with the first half of the 2000 season in the books, Seattle
has had one dreamy ride. The Mariners' 2-0 victory over the Los
Angeles Dodgers Sunday at Safeco Field left them with a 51-35
record, 16 games over .500. Only Atlanta and the Chicago White Sox
have more wins.
</P>
<P>
   It should, perhaps, be a team like the Dodgers, who have spent
$30 million more on payroll than have the Mariners, who should own
this lofty perch. Not a chance. For all their big market moxie, the
Dodgers don't have what the Mariners have _ all cylinders firing.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than any other team I've ever had,'' manager Lou Piniella
said, ``this team is playing up to its potential. We're playing as
well as we can play.''
</P>
<P>
   High praise, coming from a manager who took another
under-appreciated team, the 1990 Reds, and guided them to a World
Series title. Until now, Piniella wasn't sure he'd have another
team able to play the kind of cohesive baseball that makes a
contender into a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about the type of players I have and the type of
coaches I have,'' Piniella said. ``They make my job relatively
easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case Sunday. Starter Jamie Moyer threw seven
shutout innings. Catcher Joe Oliver hammered an 0-2 fastball from
Chan Ho Park out to left field for a 2-0 lead in the second inning,
and that was all the Mariners would need.
</P>
<P>
   Exceptional defense from second baseman Mark McLemore and
shortstop Carlos Guillen smoothed whatever bumps were in the road
for Moyer and the M's bullpen. Jose Paniagua threw a 1-2-3 eighth
inning without letting the Dodgers get the ball out of the infield,
and closer Kazuhiro Sasaki ran his streak of consecutive saves to
nine with a perfect ninth.
</P>
<P>
   That final inning started with one of the best defensive plays
of the season _ Guillen, who hasn't played shortstop regularly in
three years _ going to the deepest part of short to snare a ball
from Eric Karros. Guillen's long throw, a certified jaw-dropper,
nailed Karros at first as the crowd of 45,251 erupted.
</P>
<P>
   There aren't many English words Sasaki has mastered in his time
in Seattle, but he saved one for Guillen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great!'' Sasaki said, nodding his head up and down in obvious
delight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a huge play,'' Sasaki said through interpreter Allen
Turner. ``There's no way to know he's going to make that play. He
got me fired up. He got the team fired up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Guillen doesn't get that out, who knows what happens next?
That turned everything around for us.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, did Oliver, who has been rock-steady since being forced
into the role of everyday starting catcher with injuries to Dan
Wilson and Tom Lampkin. He had three hits, the only hits allowed by
Park in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver doubled in the fifth and singled in the seventh, both on
curves. But it was what he did to an 0-2 fastball in the second
inning that riled Park.
</P>
<P>
   Batting after David Bell's sinking liner had been dropped in
right field, Oliver hit his third homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed with one pitch and that one pitch made me a loser,''
Park said. ``That guy (Oliver) was the best hitter in the world
today. I threw an 0-2 fastball for a home run and it cost me the
game. That's a very hard-luck loss for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Moyer is now 8-3 after dominating the Dodgers. He allowed seven
hits in seven innings, but always got the key pitch when he needed
it. With two on and one out in the fifth, Moyer got Jim Leyritz to
ground into a double play. With one on and one out in the fifth,
Moyer induced another double-play grounder.
</P>
<P>
   The best bit of pitching for Moyer came in the sixth after a
bunt single by rookie Mike Metcalf _ his first big-league hit _ and
a single to center by Adrian Beltre put men at first and second
with no one out and the 3-4-5 spots in the order due up.
</P>
<P>
   But Shawn Green flew out to left, Gary Sheffield took a called
third strike and Eric Karros popped out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That backdoor cutter Jamie threw Sheffield to strike him out
was something else,'' Oliver said. ``There aren't too many in
baseball who can put a good swing on that pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Moyer said the shutout was of relatively little importance to
him. The crucial accomplishment was winning and getting to the
break with a three-game lead in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a pretty good first half,'' Moyer said. ``It's not
because of any one guy. Last year, everybody contributed, but not
all at once. This year, we're all contributing now. It's been
everybody working hard and getting the job done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being chased, and since I've been here, we've always
been in the position of being the chaser. Now we've got to work
harder to get where we want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a manager.

NEW LEAGUE SHOULD HELP PROPEL WOMEN'S SOCCER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- After the Summer Olympics in Sydney ends in
October, U.S. stars Mia Hamm, Brandi Chastain, Michelle Akers and
Julie Foudy will move forward in new uniforms with new logos and
try to clear the final hurdle for women's soccer in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 Olympic gold medal victory in Atlanta, the 1999 Women's
World Cup title at the Rose Bowl, all the victory tours, television
appearances, commercial endorsements and public appearances were
geared toward the future. More specifically, the team's success has
led to the proposed launch of the finest and most competitive
women's professional soccer league in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In April, John S. Hendricks announced preliminary funding of $40
million to launch the Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA) next
April with eight franchises and commitments from each of the 20
U.S. women who captured the World Cup title a year ago today at the
Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Cable companies Time-Warner, Cox and Comcast are the big
backers. In May, Major League Soccer agreed to a comprehensive
cooperation agreement that provides a sharing of marketing and
promotion.
</P>
<P>
   MLS first planned to launch its own women's league to compete
against the WUSA. But after talks with the U.S. Soccer Federation,
the two sides felt it served the sport's best interest to work
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we have seen from other sports, having two leagues probably
is not what is best for the game and its growth,'' said veteran
national team member Carla Overbeck. ``We, as players, are ecstatic
about the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in both MLS and the WUSA agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's equal value to both sides in this agreement,''
Hendricks said.
</P>
<P>
   MLS commissioner Don Garber said: ``We're up against a fractured
market already. We both face challenges ahead, and together we can
achieve a whole lot more than if we were to work independently.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchises in Washington, D.C.; Atlanta; New York; Boston;
Orlando; Philadelphia; San Diego, and San Francisco will open the
inaugural season. The headliners include Hamm (Washington, D.C.),
Chastain (San Francisco), Kristine Lilly (Boston), Tiffeny Milbrett
(New York), Lorrie Fair (Philadelphia), Akers (Orlando), Briana
Scurry (Atlanta) and Foudy (San Diego).
</P>
<P>
   Acting WUSA commissioner Tony DiCicco, coach of the '96 gold
medalists and last year's world champions, is hoping to sign 16
big-name foreigners before the Olympics. Then it will be just six
months until the league makes its debut.

METS SHUT OUT YANKEES, 2-0 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mike Hampton thinks Mike Piazza is the toughest
player on the Mets, and he was shocked when Piazza was beaned by
Roger Clemens on Saturday night. The Mets are still furious over
the incident, but Hampton promised not to initiate any disturbances
when he started on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets did not say it, but they had plenty to lose if Hampton
touched anything off. The Mets needed a victory, not a beanball
war, and Hampton gave them their best chance for that. He stayed
out of trouble and worked seven shutout innings as the Mets beat
the Yankees, 2-0, for their only victory in this four-game subway
series.
</P>
<P>
   If Piazza is the toughest Met, Hampton might be the
second-toughest. The thought of giving in to hitters disgusts him,
and he throws his body around the field with abandon. But like
Piazza on Saturday, Hampton was forced to leave this game with an
injury. He sustained a muscle cramp in his left forearm and was
replaced by Armando Benitez before throwing his first pitch of the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez walked the first hitter he faced, Jose Vizcaino, then
struck out Chuck Knoblauch as Todd Pratt, Piazza's replacement,
threw out Vizcaino trying to steal. It was Knoblauch's first
strikeout since June 24, and Pratt's second throwout of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez struck out Derek Jeter to end the eighth. He got Felix
Jose to bounce to first with two men on to end the game for his
19th save, and first of two innings.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, who improved to 9-5, was hardly a consideration for the
All-Star team; a 2-4 start in which he posted a 6.52 earned-run
average took care of that. But in his last 12 starts, he has been
one of the majors' best pitchers, going 7-1 with a 1.87 era.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Zeile has been among the most reliable Mets hitters this
year, and he has been hot lately, hitting .353 since the start of
the Mets-Braves series on June 29. That is also what Zeile was
hitting in his career off Andy Pettitte before Sunday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile was the first batter in the fourth inning, and he sliced a
ball to right field. On Friday night, Paul O'Neill had made a
game-saving catch in nearly the same spot when he planted himself
under a high fly by Derek Bell, leaped straight up and robbed Bell
of a homer in the Yankees' 2-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile's hit was more of a line drive, and O'Neill first turned
to his left in pursuit. He reversed himself at the warning track
and jumped to his right, but the ball made it into the bullpen
safely for a home run, Zeile's 14th. O'Neill slapped the plexiglass
with his glove in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scored their next run in the seventh, without getting a
hit. Pratt _ who is 0 for 28 since June 2 _ led off with a walk.
Hampton sacrificed him to second, and when Jeff Nelson came in to
relieve Pettitte, a wild pitch brought Pratt to third. Melvin Mora
scored him with a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte (9-5) worked six and a third innings, allowing two runs
on five hits and four walks. Like Hampton, he played it straight.
The crowd stirred in the fourth inning when Pettitte buzzed a pitch
near Robin Ventura's knees, but there were no other hints of
tension.
</P>
<P>
   That was surprising, given the tenor of the comments before the
game. The Mets (48-38) made no secret of their disgust at what they
perceived to be Clemens' deliberate attempt to drill Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Piazza's very important to our organization,'' General
Manager Steve Phillips said. ``To jeopardize his career also
jeopardizes the well-being of the Mets.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza did not seem certain another incident could be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if this is the end of this,'' he said. ``I don't
know what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   As Piazza watched from the dugout, this is what happened:
Hampton kept the game, and the Yankees, under control.
