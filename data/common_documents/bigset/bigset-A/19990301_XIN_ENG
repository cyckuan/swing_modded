ISLAMABAD, February 28 (Xinhua) -- U.N Special Envoy on
Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi arrived in Kabul Sunday for talks with
the Taliban on efforts to find a peaceful solution to the Afghan
issue.
</P>
<P>
During his one-day long stay in the war-shattered country,
Brahimi is expected to meet Chairman of the Taliban militia's
ruling council Mohammad Rabbani, Mohammad Hassan Akhond, a senior
official responsible for foreign affairs, and other Taliban
officials, according to reports reaching here Sunday evening.

<P>
Brahimi, who arrived in Islamabad last week on a two-week
mission, visited Afghanistan in October last year when he met with
the milita's supreme leader Mohammad Omar at his Kandahar base in
a bid to defuse tensions between the Taliban and Iran.

The special envoy held a meeting in Islamabad with Pakistani
Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz Monday and exchanged views with him

opposition forces.

<HEADLINE> Leading Chinese Newspaper Hails Premier's Russia Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper, The
People's Daily, in an editorial published Monday, hailed Chinese
Premier Zhu Rongji's February 24-27 visit to Russia as fruitful.
</P>
<P>
"We congratulate the fruitfulness of the visit," the paper said
in the editorial entitled "A Practical Move Ahead to Expand
Cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Zhu's visit was aimed at substantiating the consensus reached
by Chinese President Jiang Zemin and his Russian counterpart Boris
Yeltsin at their earlier meetings, and boosting the bilateral
strategic partnership of cooperation based on equality and mutual
trust in all fields, especially in economy and trade.
</P>
<P>
Besides meeting Yeltsin, Zhu also held talks with his Russian
counterpart Yevgeny Primakov in the fourth regular meeting between
premiers of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
These extensive discussions proved to be constructive, the
editorial said. And as results, the two sides signed 16 accords
on cooperation in economy and trade, conventional and nuclear
energy, science and technology, and transportation.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who returned home on Sunday, also met other Russian
officials and representatives of the country's business community
during the visit.
</P>
<P>
President Yeltsin spoke highly about the Sino-Russian strategic
partnership in the making as advocated by him and Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, saying Russia is willing to open its door
for cooperation with China and that government institutions of the
two sides should seriously undertake the implementation of
bilateral accords, the editorial noted.
</P>
<P>
In their talks, Premier Zhu and his Russian counterpart
Primakov made it clear that, being mutually complementary and
embracing great potentials for cooperation, the two economies
should interact in economic and trade programs to play up their
respective advantages and beat down disadvantages.
</P>
<P>
The programs, they said, should be based on equality and mutual
benefit, and should be in line with market rules and international
norms.
</P>
<P>
Both sides recognize that there are bright prospects for
bilateral cooperation in high technology, energy, forestry logging
and timber processing, and in making home appliances, and that
these fields should be prioritized in bilateral economic
cooperation programs in the near future.
</P>
<P>
They also hold the view that cooperation between China's
provinces and Russia's states should exert a greater role,
according to the editorial.
</P>
<P>
While expressing satisfaction over their close consultation and
coordination on international issues, China and Russia hold that
at a time when the world is moving toward multi-polarity and
economic globalization, their cooperation not only conforms to the
interest of the two peoples, but also will exert positive
influences on world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
The editorial hailed that the visit has further enriched the
significance of the Sino-Russian strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
It went on to express the belief that by substantiating the
consensus and accords reached by leaders of both nations, China
and Russia will certainly be able to promote the development of
their friendly relationship on a full scale, and bring the
economic and trade cooperation, on which their leaders and the
peoples have placed high hopes, to a new high.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's All People's Party
(APP) has withdrawn from participation in the official ceremony
for the announcement of the results of presidential election,
citing "outrageous and fantastic" returns being released by the
Independence National Electoral Commission (INEC).
</P>
<P>
Ayo Opadokun, one of the two representatives of the party, said
just before the announcement of the latest results on Sunday that
they would no longer participate in the exercise at the INEC
national headquarters.
</P>
<P>
He said that a "comprehensive and detailed" statement would be
issued by the APP after receiving reports from its agents and
consulting a wide section of its members.
</P>
<P>
"The results are outrageous and a negation of the will of
voters who yearn for true democracy," he told reporters later.
</P>
<P>
Until the latest drama, the INEC had released results from 24
states and the Federal Capital territory. And after the departure
of the APP representatives, the INEC released the results from
five other states, leaving only six states left.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Calls for Halt to Air Raids on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League on Sunday called
on the United States and Britain to stop air raids on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The league said in a statement that the U.S. and Britain should
"immediately halt all military acts against Iraq."
</P>
<P>
It urged the two countries to deal with Iraq by diplomatic
means in conformity with relevant U.N. Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The league said that "it is following up with deep concern" the
continued air strikes against Iraq by the U.S. and British
warplanes, the casualties and damage to property and
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced recently it would no longer recognize the two
no-fly zones in the south and north of the country and fired at
U.S. and British warplanes patroling the zones. The U.S. and
British air forces attacked Iraqi targets, killing and wounding
Iraqi troops and civilians.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its allies imposed the no-fly zones after the 1991
Gulf War, set off by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, to allegedly
protect the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south.
</P>
<P>
The 22-nation pan-Arab forum expressed solidarity with the
Iraqi people, calling for respect for Iraq's sovereignty and
territorial integrity.

<HEADLINE> 3 Iraqi Civilians Killed in U.S.-British Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Three Iraqi civilians were
killed and several others injured Sunday afternoon when
U.S.-British warplanes attacked villages in northern Iraq, an
Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed spokesman was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency as
saying that at 1 p.m. (1000 GMT), 11 formations of U.S.-British
warplanes from a Turkish military base violated Iraq's northern
airspace over Neineva, Dohuk and Erbil provinces.
</P>
<P>
The enemy planes attacked civilian installations and villages
in Neineva province, killing two shepherds and one three-year-old
child, injuring several others, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi air defenses encountered the enemy planes and forced
them to flee at 4:42 p.m. (1342 GMT), he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 clashes have taken place since last December's
air strikes against Iraqi targets by U.S. and British warplanes.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has announced ever since that it will challenge all
western jets violating its airspace in the name of patrolling the
no-fly zones, imposed by the U.S. and its allies after the 1991
Gulf War with the claimed aim of protecting the Kurds in the north
and the Shiite Muslims in the south from "Baghdad's suppression."
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. remained adamant to pursuing its containment of
Iraq by patrolling the zones.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, 23 Iraqi civilians were injured when U.S. and
British warplanes attacked military and civilian targets in the
southern no-fly zone.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official Criticizes Israel's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian
official Sunday sharply criticized the closure imposed by Israel
on the Palestinian territories, Jerusalem Media and Communication
Center reported.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath as saying
that the closure was aimed at destroying the peace process
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Shaath said that it was unfair for the Palestinian people to
suffer from frequent closures, which were carried out by Israel
as a collective punishment.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens
ordered a full military closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
which is likely to last at least four days.
</P>
<P>
The closure will prevent thousands of Palestinians who work in
Israel from getting to their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Arens said that a major reason for the closure was warnings of
terrorist attacks around the Jewish holiday of Purim, which
Israelis celebrate this week.
</P>
<P>
He also said that there was effective security cooperation
between Israel and Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
told Israel's Army Radio that the closure was necessary because
the PNA was not fulfilling its commitments to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that the PNA has not "lifted a finger" against
the Islamic militant Hamas group.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Trade Unions Blame Poor Governance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Union (ZCTU) said Sunday that the inability of taking meaningful
steps to redress the country's economic and social problems
emanated from a crisis of governance in the nation.
</P>
<P>
The crisis expresses itself as a failure of the government to
obey basic rules of accountability and transparency, the ZCTU said
in a declaration adopted at the end of a three-day national
working people's convention.
</P>
<P>
The ZCTU also blamed the government for neglecting human rights
and failing to decentralize power in ways that enable meaningful
participation of people in public institutions.
</P>
<P>
It noted that poor governance has resulted in severe decline in
incomes, employment, health and food security, and the almost
collapse of public services and the absence of a national
constitution framed by and for the people.

<HEADLINE> Israel Keeps Tight Lip on Reported Bombing in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Amid wide-spread reports
that four Israelis, including a high-ranking officer, were killed
in south Lebanon Sunday, Israel kept a tight lip on the incident
without confirming nor denying the reports.
</P>
<P>
Several hours after the reports of the killing broke out, both
Israel Radio and Channel One television said that Israeli
warplanes attacked suspected Hezbollah guerrilla targets and the
army staged heavy shelling in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
They also reported that dozens of Israelis demonstrated in
front of the Defense Ministry headquarters in Tel Aviv, demanding
a unilateral Israeli troop withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But they did not explain the backdrop against which the air
raid was launched and the demonstration staged, without mentioning
the reports on Hezbollah bombing.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu canceled a scheduled
address at a social forum in Jerusalem Sunday night, but his
media adviser did not give any reason for the change of the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that Israel might be pondering how to disclose
to the public the worst Israeli loss in south Lebanon since
September 1997 when 12 navy commandos were killed there.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said that Hezbollah guerrillas detonated
two bombs near an Israeli convoy in the so-called Israeli security
zone, killing one general, one civilian and two soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The general was reportedly identified as the head of an
Israeli liaison unit with the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army. He
was the highest-ranking officer killed in south Lebanon since its
1982 invasion.
</P>
<P>
The bombing was the second serious blow to the Israeli army in
less than a week. Last Tuesday, an Israeli commando unit was
ambushed by Hezbollah guerrillas, with three officers being
killed and five soldiers wounded.
</P>
<P>
These incidents will undoubtedly prompt a heated debate in
Israel over the wisdom of Israel's military presence in the
security zone set up by Israel in 1985 with the claimed aim of
protecting its northern areas from cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Recent opinion polls showed that more than 40 percent of
Israelis favor a unilateral withdrawal from south Lebanon, nearly
double the figure in early last year.
</P>
<P>
But the Israeli army and the government insist that a troop
pullback without reaching a security agreement with the Lebanese
government first will endanger the northern areas.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senators Look For Alternatives to Independent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senator Carl Levin, an
author of the Independent Counsel Act 20 years ago, said Sunday
the law may be beyond rescue as a result of Kenneth Starr's
investigation of the White House.
</P>
<P>
"My great fear is that the excesses of Kenneth Starr have now
made it almost impossible for us to reauthorize this," Levin, the
Democratic senator, said on NBC's "Meet the Press."
</P>
<P>
Levin suggested that if it can't be saved, one alternative
might be giving the Justice Department's Office of Public
Integrity greater investigative powers.
</P>
<P>
Other senators agreed that the law, enacted after "Watergate
incident", was unlikely to survive when it's current authorization
expires on June 30. Most welcomed its demise.
</P>
<P>
The 1978 law grew out of President Nixon's firing of Archibald
Cox, the special counsel investigating Watergate. The aim was to
ensure that future investigations of high officials could be
carried out without fear of interference from the president or his
appointees at the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
Republican Senator Fred Thompson, who chairs the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee, which is holding hearings on the
act, said the act is going to die not because of Starr but because
of a fundamental problem in balancing independence with
accountability.
</P>
<P>
Another Democratic Senator Christopher Dodd said the 20
independent counsels appointed under the act had spent 150 million
U.S. dollars. "We're avoiding other policy issues, we're wasting
money, we're destroying the reputations of people," he said. "We
ought to give it a decent burial."
</P>
<P>
The independent counsel law was allowed to expire in 1992, when
Republicans were unhappy with independent counsel Lawrence Welsh's
long and expensive inquiry into the Iran-Contra affair. It was
finally reauthorized in 1994.
</P>
<P>
A House subcommittee is expected to hold hearings on Tuesday,
and Thompson's committee will hold one Wednesday to hear arguments
for or against the statute and possible alternatives.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Launch Massive Attack on Hezbollah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Israel will launch a massive
attack on Hizbollah guerrillas targets in south Lebanon in
retaliation for the killing of four Israelis including a general
Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and top military
officials said.
</P>
<P>
At a hurriedly-arranged news conference in Tel Aviv, Netanyahu
and Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz said the army will stage a ground,
air and sea attacks on all Hezbollah bases in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"The army will fight the Hezbollah ... it has the capability,"
Mofaz told the news conference.
</P>
<P>
Israel also provided details about the four Israelis killed in
two roadside blasts in the self-styled Israeli security zone in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Brig.-Gen Erez Gerstein, 38, the head of the Israeli military
liaison unit with the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army, became the
highest-ranking Israeli officer killed in the zone since the 1982
Israeli invasion.
</P>
<P>
An Israel Radio correspondent and two soldiers were also
killed.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army launched air strikes on suspected guerrilla
hideouts in south Lebanon after the bombing. Netanyahu said this
was the beginning of the retaliation attack.

<HEADLINE> AL Concerned Over Iran's Exercises Near Disputed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League Sunday expressed
deep concern over the maneuvers conducted by Iran near a disputed
Gulf island and its likely consequences to the relations with
neighboring Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The the 22-nation pan-Arab forum said in a statement that the
drills could undermine the confidence-building process sought by
all countries in the region, including Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran announced Saturday that its navy and air forces had begun a
nine-day exercise in the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman, which will
include the seas around the disputed Abu Musa island.
</P>
<P>
Both Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) claim sovereignty
over the three islands of Abu Musa, Greater and Lesser Tunbs.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the UAE have expressed readiness to solve their
disputes over the islands through peaceful means. Iran favors a
solution to the problem through bilateral talks while the UAE
enforces international arbitration.
</P>
<P>
The statement spoke of the previous military build-up of Iran
on the three islands and considered the on-going war games as an
attempt to maintain the status quo.
</P>
<P>
It said such actions will complicate the situation in the Gulf
and torpedo all hopes for Iran to improve its relations with Arab
countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes launched
large-scale raids on Lebanese southern and eastern areas in
retaliation for the attacks by Lebanese guerrillas, the Voice of
the People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Israeli jets fired dozens of air-to-surface missiles on a
number of villages that were believed to be the hideouts of
Lebanese guerrillas inside and outside its occupied border zone.
</P>
<P>
The warplanes also struck suspected guerrillas' bases at
Naameh, 16 kilometers south of Beirut, and the country's eastern
area of Belbek.
</P>
<P>
There is no immediate reports of casualties from the air raids
which came only hours after four Israelis, including a general and
a radio's military journalist, were killed inside the security zone
in two roadside bomb blasts.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed
responsibility for the bomb attacks, saying its fighters detonated
the bombs when an Israeli convoy carrying Israeli high-ranking
officers passed by.
</P>
<P>
This is the second heaviest loss the Israeli forces suffered in
less than a week. on Tuesday, Hezbollah ambushed an Israeli
paratroops commando, killing three, including its commander, and
wounding five others.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Hezbollah has been spearheading a guerrilla war to
oust Israeli occupation forces.

There were 160 out of 199 suspected arsonists questioned in 150
arson cases who were Caucasians. According to a 1997 report from
the National Asian-Pacific American Consortium, in 1996 there were
534 acts of violence committed against Asian-Americans, an

The U.S. is a nation of immigrants, but in recent years, moves
to restrict immigration have been on the rise. The Welfare Reform
Law, which was approved by the U.S. Congress and the Immigration
Law enacted on April 1, 1997, reduced and did away subsidies for
immigrants and had many clauses discriminating against illegal
immigrants and causing many difficulties for immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The United States began repatriating illegal immigrants in
large numbers, in many cases infringing on the rights of
immigrants. According to the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
in 1996, Mexican consulates in the United States received more
than 80,000 appeals for help from Mexican immigrants. In September
1997, a group of 56 Guatemalan immigrants were shackled and
handcuffed by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service for
return to Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
A report on teenagers said that thousands of Mexicans enter the
United States every year as illegal immigrants, and a considerable
number of them are teenagers. From 1993 to 1996, some 62,000
Mexican children were taken by the U.S. authorities to the border
between Mexico and the United States with no protection of basic
rights (26).

BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
today that he will exchange views with American leaders on Sino-U.
S. relations and other international and regional issues of common

</P>
<P>
He made this remark during a meeting with visiting U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said he will also contact people in various sectors during
his stay in the U.S. in a bid to increase mutual understanding
between the Chinese and American peoples, expand the consensus
between the two countries, and promote the healthy development of
Sino-U.S. ties on the basis of the three joint communiques signed
by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Albright told Zhu that the U.S. government and people are
looking forward to Zhu's trip in April. The U.S. side regards
mutual ties as very important, she noted.
</P>
<P>
U.S.-China relations have entered an important period,

BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Qian Qichen met today
with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to discuss Sino-U.
S. relations as well as international and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that although Sino-U.S. relations have undergone some
twists and turns from time to time since the establishment of
diplomatic ties two decades ago, generally speaking, the two
countries have made major progress together.
</P>
<P>
Sino-U.S. relations have seen new and important developments
especially since the exchange of visits between the two heads of
state, he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Premier Zhu Rongji will pay an official visit to
the U.S. in April at the invitation of U.S. President Clinton, and
said that this is a very important and major event in bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu's visit will provide a good opportunity for the
further growth of bilateral relations, Qian said, and expressed
the hope that the two sides will make joint efforts to ensure the
success of the visit.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the belief that the two countries can narrow
difference and expand common ground through dialog on the basis of
equality and mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
Albright said that the growth of U.S.-China ties has brought
about enormous benefit to the people of both countries since
diplomatic relations were forged 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
She said that Chinese Premier Zhu's U.S. visit is very
important to both nations, and the U.S. believes that this visit
will play an important role in pushing forward bilateral relations
and promote the momentum of the establishment of a constructive
strategic partnership, she added.
</P>

Albright said the U.S. is prepared to work with China as
cooperative partners instead of adversaries, and added that the
two nations can increase mutual understanding and common ground
through dialog.
</P>
<P>
Qian also reaffirmed China's principled stand on the Taiwan
issue. Albright said that the U.S. government adheres to the "one

<HEADLINE> Afghans, Key Players to Resolve Turmoil: UN Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.N. Special Envoy on
Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi said Monday that Afghans are the key
players in resolving the long-standing imbroglio in their
war-shattered country.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of asking the U.N. to restore peace, the Afghans have
to make some efforts themselves to end the hostilities," Brahimi
told the media in Peshawar, capital of Pakistan's North West
Frontier Province.
</P>
<P>
Regretting that the Afghans are fighting against one another in
their homeland for years, Brahimi said the United Nations is
trying to help them bring peace to their war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
But they must also make some efforts in this regard, he
insisted.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi, who arrived in Peshawar from Kabul Sunday, described
his meetings with Taliban leaders as "very constructive."
</P>
<P>
"We have had very interesting talks in Kabul," he said. "And
now we are going to speak to the other side (the opposition). We
will talk to them about the same thing. We will request them
please cooperate for peace."
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question about the proposed Six Plus Two meeting,
Brahimi said the group has been holding discussions in New York on
how to help restore lasting peace in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, he said, is encouraging the Six Plus Two to
work together for the restoration of peace in the country. The
neighboring countries have a key role to play in putting an end to
the hostilities, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Six Plus Two comprises Pakistan, Iran, Tajikistan,
Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, China, Russia and the United States. The
group is expected to meet in the Uzbek capital of Tashkent later
this year.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi reiterated that the United Nations is doing its best.
"But we are sure that the Afghans also understand that they have
some responsibility. They need to work together to bring peace to
Afghanistan," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy arrived here last week on his fresh peace
mission and made a one-day visit to Kabul on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He held meetings with Taliban leaders and was assured of full
protection to U.N. international staff in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, the Taliban leaders also expressed their
readiness to hold talks with the opposition on cease-fire and
exchange of prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi is scheduled to meet the Afghan opposition in Peshawar
on Monday.

<HEADLINE> EU Starts New Phase for Future Membership Preparations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Tuesday that it is stepping up preparations for EU membership of
five central European countries of Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania,
Romania and Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the European Union's executive body, said that
preparations for membership would involve bilateral "screening" to
overhaul the laws and other measures in readiness for EU accession.
It is believed the screening process will help the five candidates
to increase understanding of the rules underpinning the EU and to
identify more clearly which issues they need to address.
</P>
<P>
The EU has yet to open accession negotiations with the five
countries which are the "second wave" candidates for EU membership
and has just started "concrete negotiations" with them in November.
The 15-nation bloc has fully accepted the first wave candidates --
Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus
last year.
</P>
<P>
It said that the new bilateral screening phase follows the
multilateral screening which lasted about 11 months and was just
finished.
</P>
<P>
The multilateral exercise, the commission said, revealed that
the difference in readiness for membership among all the central
European candidates is not that significant as far as political
and legislative issues are concerned.
</P>
<P>
"When, at the appropriate moment, the EU decides to extend the
negotiations to new candidate countries, they will not have great
difficulty in integrating into the ongoing negotiations at a
comparable level of preparation," the European Commission said.
</P>
<P>
"This move underlines the global and inclusive character of the
accession process. An indicative calendar for the bilateral
exercise, which is scheduled to finish in the autumn of 1999, is
attached," it added.

However, the EU report said that some member states, such as
Luxembourg, Greece and Finland, showed signs of growth. But
several member states, such as Spain, France, Sweden, the
Netherlands, Portugal, Germany, Belgium and Britain, had "more or
less stagnating production" while Italy and Denmark witnessed
significant falls.
</P>

Eurostat noted that the 11-nation euro zone and the 15-nation

<HEADLINE> France Worried About Reviving Tension in Southern Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 1 (Xinhua) -- France said on Monday that it is
worried about the revival of tension in southern Lebanon, as
Israel is carrying out reprisal attacks against the Hezbollah
guerrillas for the killing of an Israeli army general and three
other soldiers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac said that he is strongly
concerned about the revival of tension in southern Lebanon and the
grave risks which hang over the civilians there.
</P>
<P>
Chirac expressed his concern during a meeting with a leader of
the Maronite Churach of Lebanon at the Elysee presidential palace,
said presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.
</P>
<P>
"The rising of the tension in southern Lebanon is very worrying
and France calls for restraint by the Israeli authorities as well
as the Lebanese authorities," said French Foreign Ministry
assistant spokesman Francois Rivasseau.
</P>
<P>
He said that France is making concertation with the United
States, which is now the chairman of the supervision group in
charge of implementing a 1996 ceasefire agreement in southern
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
France also suggests that the members of the group meet soon to
discuss the grave situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from France and the United States, the group also
includes Israel, Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
An attack by the Hezbollah guerrillas, who are pro-Iranian
Shiite Muslims fighting Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon,
resulted in the death of General Erez Gerstein of Israeli Army on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The death of Gerstein is leading to violent reprisals by the
Israeli troops.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Sets Up Tribunals to Settle Disputes in Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Sixty-four election tribunals, one
in each district, have been set up in Bangladesh to settle
disputes in the recently-held municipal elections, an Election
Commission official told Xinhua on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-one sub-judges have been appointed for 61 tribunals to
settle disputes in their respective districts, while the district
magistrates in Rangamati, Khagrachihari and Bandarban, in
southeastern Bangladesh's Chittagong Hill Tracts, will act as
judges of the tribunals of the three districts.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission has urged all concerned to lodge
complaints with the tribunals within 30 days of the publication of
the gazette notification of the elected representatives as per
municipal elections rule.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, re-polling was held on Monday in one of the 20
centers, where polling was postponed due to clashes among rival
candidates and snatching of ballot boxes during the elections.
Re-polling will be held in the remaining centers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Elections in 136 out of the country's 182 municipalities were
held from February 23 to 25, to elect 136 chairmen, 1,305 ward
commissioners and 435 women commissioners.
</P>

The polls were boycotted by the country's opposition alliance,
comprising the major opposition -- the Bangladesh Nationalist
Party, the Jatiya Party, the Jamaat-e-Islami and the Islami Oikya
Jote (Islamic Solidarity Front) and others, which staged a
three-day nationwide strike to foil the elections.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has called for canceling the election results
and announcing a new election schedule, urging the government to
accept their four-point demand, including the resignation of the
chief election commissioner.

<TEXT>
<P>
WENZHOU, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Insurance companies have made

disaster in the city of Wenzhou in east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Designated beneficiaries of 14 passengers who had bought

<P>
In addition, family members of all 61 victims were offered
compensation of 2,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Family members of the victims have expressed their satisfaction
with the efficient work done by the insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
The Sichuan Provincial Branch of the People's Insurance Company
of China should pay China Southwest Airlines 66 million yuan in
carrier's responsibility insurance, but this has not yet been done
for some reason, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Some family members today went to a Rui'an funeral parlor to
claim the bodies and personal effects of the victims. The bodies

GUANGZHOU, March 1 (Xinhua ) -- South China's Guangdong
Province, one of the country's major economic powerhouses, prefers
a more stable and substantial economic prosperity rather than an
audacious pursuit of sharp figures.
</P>
<P>
Governor Lu Ruihua said yesterday that Guangdong will strive to
retain a seven percent annual growth rate for the next dozen years,
and that this will be sufficient to bring the economy up to modern
standards.
</P>
<P>
As for this year, he expressed confidence in an 8.5 percent
increase, which he said is based on the strong gross domestic
product of 793 billion yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
"But we should also pay attention to some irregularities in our
economy such as redundant construction," he warned.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that this year, priority should be given to the
rural economy and high-technology development in order to expand
domestic and foreign markets. At the same time, the province plans
to tighten supervision of local financial institutions.

<P>
Zhao told the gathering that relations between China and the

<HEADLINE> Obasanjo Becomes Nigeria's Next President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Olusegun Obasanjo of the People's
Democratic Party (PDP) has won Saturday's presidential election
and become president- elect of Nigeria's Fourth Republic.
</P>
<P>
According to the election results announced Monday by the
Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of Nigeria,
Obasanjo won 18.74 million of the 29.85 million votes cast,
representing 62.78 percent of the total while his rival Chief Olu
Falae secured 11.11 million, representing 37.22 percent.
</P>
<P>
The retired general secured more than 25 percent of the votes
cast in 33 out of 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory in
the west African country while Falae received a quarter of the
votes in 23 states.
</P>
<P>
Under the election guidelines issued by the INEC, to win the
presidency, a candidate is expected to score a simple majority and
25 percent of the votes cast in at least 25 of the 36 states and
the Federal Capital Territory in the country.
</P>
<P>
INEC Chairman Ephraim Akpata declared Monday in capital Abuja
that "with the foregoing results, it is therefore evident that the
presidential candidate of the PDP, General Olusegun Obasanjo, has
emerged the winner."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that "with the formal announcement of the
 presidential election results, the stage has been set for the
enthronement of a genuine democratic order in Nigeria."
</P>
<P>
The elected president who regained the power 20 years after
handing over the power to an elected government in 1979 is to be
sworn in on May 29 at the end of General Abdulsalam Abubakar's
transition program.
</P>
<P>
While casting his vOte on Saturday in his southwestern hometown
of Abeokuta, Obasanjo told reporters that "we are hopeful the
transition to democracy will be smooth and with the rest of the
world watching Nigeria will once again regain its former glory."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abubakar noted Saturday in capital Abuja that
Nigerians and politicians had worked hard to ensure the success of
the transition program, which would terminate on May 29 with the
handover to a civilian administration.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's election was closely monitored by international
observers from various organizations including the European Union,
the Organization of African Unity, the Commonwealth and the U.S.
Carter Center.
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter who arrived in Nigeria last
week said Saturday that he was confident of the on-going
transition program, adding "my belief is that the overwhelming
number of powerful military leaders in this country are committed
to the process of a transfer of power to a civilian government."
</P>
<P>
During his campaign, Obasanjo has called for political reform
in the west African country to help revive Nigeria's moribund
economy and pledged to set up an anti-corruption agency with
wide-ranging powers used to deal with corruption cases.

<P>
CAIRO, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs of the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's biggest telephone company Bezeq has been
re-classified as a semi-private company which is to be jointly
run by private entities and the government.
</P>
<P>
The company will be able to choose suppliers based on its own
criteria and to shake off government supervision over its wage
management.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Reports from the 10 biggest constructors in
Israel show that housing sales slumped by another 15.7 percent in
February against January.
</P>
<P>
The continuing decline reflects the slowdown in the housing
market, which has become even worse in anticipation of the national
elections in May.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Lockheed Martin has offered a contract to Israel
Aircraft Industries to produce 20 vertical stabilizers in a deal
potentially worth 53 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, Lockheed has conditioned the full contracts on the
Israeli Air Forces opting to purchase 50 F-16s. The air force is
currently reviewing its data and is expected to choose between the
Boeing-made F-15I or the cheaper F-16.
</P>
<P>
Muscat -- The imports of Oman went up by 13 percent from
1.9 billion riyals (5.1 billion U.S.dollars) in 1997 to 2.2 billion
riyals (5.7 billion dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Most of Omani imports are machines, electric appliances, metal
products, foodstuffs, live animals and plants, the Arabic daily
Al-Sharq Al-Awsat reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The United Arab Emirates tops the list among exporters to Oman,
accounting for 25.2 percent of Oman's import volume in 1998 at a
value of 550.8 million riyals (1.4 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Japan ranks the second with 15.7 percent of the total at a
value of 343.8 million riyals (904.7 million dollars).

Baghdad claims that since last December's Operation Desert Fox

missiles and bombs in a low-grade war of attrition, killing and

<HEADLINE> Pollution Quota Sales to Play Major Role in Canadian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The trading of greenhouse gas
emissions will soon play a major role in the Canadian economy and
in the lives of ordinary citizens, said a government-funded
economic organization on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Canada is now estimated to be at least 25 percent behind its
target of reducing gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, said
the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy in a
report. The target was agreed in an international convention
signed in Kyoto more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Canada has agreed to reduce emissions by 6 percent below the
1990 levels by the year 2012, but governments are still wrestling
with key questions about how this will be accomplished.
</P>
<P>
The roundtable, which is funded by the federal government,
believes that the trading of emissions will play an important role
in meeting that commitment at a lower cost.
</P>
<P>
It lays out five different schemes to create a system in which
limits would be set on the amount of carbon dioxide or other
greenhouse gases companies would be allowed to produce. Companies
that reduce their emissions, either by improving fuel efficiency
measures, would be allowed to sell their leftover pollution quotas
to other companies.
</P>
<P>
It has the potential to be a multi-billion-dollar activity, the
report says.
</P>
<P>
"If the Kyoto agreement to limit greenhouse gas emissions is to
be implemented by the United States and other developed countries,
it is clear international trading of emission-reduction credits
will be required. For Canadian firms to participate, a domestic
program needs to be in place. Canadians will want to know the cost,
who pays and what benefits will be derived," says the report.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton Sunday turned up the pressure on
congressional Republicans to spend more federal money on hiring
new teachers.
</P>
<P>
-- Nigeria's former military leader, General Oluseguln Obasanjo,
appeared Sunday to have easily won election as the civilian
president who will take power from the armed forces. But Obasanjo'
s opponent, Olu Falae, rejected the election results as fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Ethiopia declared victory over Eritrea in their border
conflict after a four-day offensive dislodged the Eritrean army
from a piece of border-land both sides conceded all along was not
worth very much.
</P>
<P>
-- The California Republican Party's winter convention
underscored an extraordinary turn in Republican politics: an early,
and colossal, outpouring of support by party members of all
stripes for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who has yet to formally
announce his presidential intentions and who is untested and
largely unknown on the national stage.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Serb troops clashed with ethnic Albanian rebels in north and
south Kosovo as diplomatic observers trailed Serb tank convoys to
try to keep fighting from escalating. Rebels ambushed a police
patrol at Kasanik, killing one officer. French President Chirac
visited Macedonia to warn that fighting must stop.
</P>
<P>
-- Republicans are trying to breathe life into a 10 percent tax-
cut proposal with a plan to tap the Social Security surplus. A
half-dozen Democrats are backing the plan because it would fence
off the federal retirement program's surpluses from the rest of
the budget over three years.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Riot Troops Formed in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Defense Minister Gen.
Wiranto said Monday that uncovering the masterminds of each riot
in the country is the military's most difficult task amid
increasing demand for security personnel to respect human rights.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters here after forming two units of anti-riot
troops, consisting of 3,033 members, Wiranto said there are three
things the military has to do comprehensively whenever a riot
erupts.
</P>
<P>
These are ending the unrest immediately, taking legal action
against those found to have violated the law and uncovering the
provocateurs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto said the two units of anti-riot troops, to be managed
by the police, was set up to tackle riots.
</P>
<P>
They will be equipped with rifles, tear gas, rubber bullets,
shields, helmets, dogs and vehicles and will be deployed to
disperse mobs in riot-torn areas where security personnel are
unable to control unrest, he said.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the Indonesian Police Brig. Gen. Togar S. Sianipar
said a battalion of the anti-riot troops will soon be sent to
Ambon, capital of Maluku Province, to help security forces handle
the series of bloody clashes between Muslims and Christians that
have been lasting for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
The clashes, which have claimed at least 150 lives since
January 19, have forced thousands of residents to flee to
neighboring provinces.

<HEADLINE> BIS to Help China Strengthen Its Banking System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The president of the Bank for
International Settlement (BIS) said today that it will help China
strengthen its banking system in an effort to foster a healthy
financial situation.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Crockett, head of BIS, said after a banking symposium in
Beijing that a sound system of supervision is crucial to China's
financial position.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China's financial institutions now have
more investment decision-making authority as the country is now in
the middle of the process of transition from a centrally planned
banking system to a market system.
</P>
<P>
This will cause financial institutions to be more cautious and
prudent when extending loans, which is conducive to the country's
economic growth, said Crockett.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis has been fully contained now that
Thailand and the Republic of Korea have stabilized their financial
situations, Crockett said, adding that ROK may resume its economic
growth this year.
</P>
<P>
However, it will still be a difficult year for Latin America as
Brazil is plagued by a recession. The situation in the United
States is quite good, and the recovery of Europe may continue
despite a slowdown in the fourth quarter last year, said Crockett.

<HEADLINE> Talks With U.N. Successful: Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Taliban of Afghanistan
Monday described talks with the United Nations as highly
successful, saying the militia will provide full guarantee to the
U.N. staff if they resume relief work in the war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
"Talks with Brahimi were constructive. We have not only assured
full security to the U.N. staff on return to Afghanistan but will
also facilitate them to smoothly continue their activities," the
Taliban's chief representative in Pakistan Maulvi Saeed-ur-Rahman
Haqqani said.
</P>
<P>
Lakhdar Bahimi, U.N. special envoy on Afghanistan, visited
Kabul on Sunday and held talks with head of the Taliban interim
council Mulla Mohammad Rabbani and senior official responsible for
foreign affairs Mulla Hasan Akhund on his fresh peace initiative
and matters concerning security for the U.N. staff.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is seeking security guarantees for
international staff to return to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
All U.N. staff were evacuated from Afghanistan last August
following the killing of a senior Italian U.N. military officer in
Kabul which appeared to be retaliation for U.S. cruise missile
attacks on camps allegedly operated by Saudi dissident Osama bin
Laden.
</P>
<P>
Haqqani, who also attended the Taliban-U.N. talks in Kabul,
hoped that the United Nations would send its international staff
back to Afghanistan for the resumption of relief activities to
help needy people.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the media here reported that the Taliban militia
agreed to back the U.N. peace efforts and expressed readiness to
hold talks with their rivals on cease-fire and exchange of
prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready for talks with the opposition for cease-fire and
exchange of POWs if they show sincerity," Rabbani was quoted as
telling Brahimi.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi is in the region for talks with the Taliban and
Afghanistan's neighbors to try to find a peaceful solution to the
conflicts in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He is expected shortly to convene a meeting of the so-called
Six Plus Two group comprising Afghanistan's six immediate
neighbors plus Russia and the United States to review scant
progress toward peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations wants to see a broad-based government
grouping all factions, political parties and ethnic groups to end
the agony of 20 years of conflicts in Afghanistan which have
devastated the country.

<HEADLINE> China Resumes Stock Trading Following Y-2K Testing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Trading resumed today on China's
two stock exchanges after a successful testing for Y-2K problems
during the extended Lunar New Year Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, the benchmark Composite Stock Index of the
Shanghai Stock Exchange opened the first trading session of the
Year of the Rabbit on the Chinese calendar at 1,092.14 points, and
ended the day at 1,097.97 points, up 7.88 points from the close on
February 9, the last trading day of the Year of the Tiger.
</P>
<P>
The Component Stock Index of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in the
southern booming city of Shenzhen, opened today at 2,760.55 points,
and finished the session at 2,790.67 points, up 35.37 points from
the closing on February 9.
</P>
<P>
Stock turnover at the two exchanges totaled more than 3.4
billion yuan today, a better-than-moderate value by most recent
standards.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with arrangements of the China Securities
Regulatory Commission, the industry watchdog, the two exchanges
began to test their computer systems, the third time so far, on
February 10 when they purposely turned their clocks to December 31,
1999.
</P>
<P>
The computer systems successfully turned to January 1, 2000 the
next day, according to an official source.
</P>
<P>
The latest tests, which lasted through February 13, covered all
types of trading -- trading in A-shares, B-shares, state treasury
bonds and funds -- and the entire trading process. A-shares are
reserved for Chinese investors only, while B-shares are for
overseas investors only.
</P>
<P>
During the tests, the two stock exchanges also conducted the
trading of three mock issues each, as well as computer-based
purchases and share listings.
</P>
<P>
The latest tests were also the most comprehensive ever for
China's securities industry, covering more than 2,000 securities
operations nationwide, some subsidiaries of the Industrial and
Commercial Bank, the Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank, the
China Construction Bank seven other banks, and the
telecommunications, power and information service agencies in some
selected areas, the source said.
</P>
<P>
"The only difference from real trading was that there was no
capital clearance for the mock trading," according to an analyst.
</P>
<P>
During the tests, both stock price flashboards and telephone-
based commission trading systems were kept working as on normal
trading days, the analyst said, adding that even price-movement
information was constantly fed into the stock-information machines.
</P>
<P>
Some uninformed investors were more than excited by across-the-
board soaring prices, and tried to place buying orders over the
phone to make quick, big money, according to the analyst.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Shanghai Stock Exchange said that Y-2K
problems were found in the computer system of the exchange and in
securities business operations during all three tests, and efforts
are being made to tackle these problems.
</P>
<P>
China's stock market has developed robustly since its
establishment in 1991, and a total of 851 companies had been
listed on the two stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen by the
end of last year when year-end market capitalization was 1.95
trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics also show that the number of China's stock
investors now exceeds 38 million.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Continue Retaliation on Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government decided
Monday to continue the massive military action launched Sunday in
Lebanon to retaliate the killing of four Israelis by Hezbollah
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a meeting of the Israeli government's
"kitchen cabinet," or inner cabinet, which comprises Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and
Defense Minister Moshe Arens.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Netanyahu held further consultations with
the wider security cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Israel waged heavy shelling and large-scale air attacks on
Hezbollah guerrillas targets in south Lebanon Sunday after the
guerrillas detonated two roadside bombs, killing an Israeli
general, two soldiers and a journalist.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli military offensive is among the most intensive
since April 1996, when Israel launched the Operation Grapes of
Wrath to punish Hezbollah guerrillas for their rocket attacks on
northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Security officials said the scale of the latest retaliation
will depend to a large extent on whether Hezbollah will fire
Katyusha rockets into northern Israeli towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
Although the guerrillas refrained from attacking northern
Israel Sunday night, the Israeli army instructed tens of
thousands of residents to remain in underground bomb shelters
Monday after they spent the night there.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-declared "security zone" 15 kilometers
into south Lebanon in 1985 allegedly to protect its northern areas
from cross-border attacks. The zone has since become a flash-point
of conflicts between the Israeli army and Hezbollah guerrillas
fighting to end the Israeli occupation.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Brings AIDS Prevention under Legal Framework </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai today promulgated a
regulation to clarify governmental functions in AIDS prevention
and stipulate the rights and legal responsibilities of AIDS
carriers.
</P>
<P>
Consisting of 46 articles, the regulation is the first legal
document on this question issued by the city since the first case
of AIDS infection was found carried by a foreigner here in 1987.
</P>
<P>
According to the article, public places such as hotels and
restaurants should provide necessary AIDS prevention measures, and
all suspected AIDS/HIV-positive people, including those involved
in prostitution and drug addiction, are obliged to have medical
examinations at AIDS-testing centers.
</P>
<P>
It also stipulates that education on AIDS prevention methods
and related knowledge should be made available to school students,
and calls on people to respect the privacy of AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, 191 people in Shanghai had been found
to be infected with the disease, 49 of whom were local residents.
Bustling population flow and a lack of AIDS-related education in
the metropolis are considered the main reasons for the increasing
incidence. Some people have warned of a possible explosion of the
disease if it is not effectively controlled.

<HEADLINE> Second Developing-8 Summit Starts in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Heads of state or government or
their representatives from the Developing Eight (D-8) countries
started their two-day meeting here Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The leaders from Pakistan, Iran, Nigeria, Egypt, Turkey,
Indonesia, Malaysia and host Bangladesh will review the progress
made by the newly-emerged economic group since it was formally
launched in Istanbul, Turkey, in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel changed his seat with
Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at the beginning of the
session, symbolizing a change in the chairmanship of the D-8 bloc.
</P>
<P>
Globalization, trade and economic cooperation were the key
topics in the speeches of the leaders.
</P>
<P>
"We are gathered here to reaffirm our determination to forge a
strong partnership for development," Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif told the inaugural session.
</P>
<P>
There is a need to monitor, regulate and manage globalization,
as "market instability and volatile financial flows have shown the
fragility of the global economy and dangers of unchecked and
unmanaged globalization," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Progress flows from peace. Without peace and stability, the
hope of growth and development will continue to be as illusory as
a mirage in the desert," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that D-8 countries accord priority to the
development of infrastructure, industry and agriculture and
promote the active involvement of the private sector in trade and
investment among the members.
</P>
<P>
For her part, Prime Minister Hasina called for evolving a
mechanism and structure to safeguard against future crises as the
recent financial crisis, which particularly hit some Asian
countries and convening a business forum of entrepreneurs of D-8
member countries.
</P>
<P>
"The promotion of trade among the D-8 countries is a most
promising area of cooperation," she said.
</P>
<P>
Since the emergence of the D-8, its member countries have
progressed in several areas and projects have been initiated in
some areas identified as priority areas of cooperation, she said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the recent crisis hitting his country, Malaysian
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad said that as "we are not adept in
the use of our wealth and the free flows of capital... a lot of
our own money is held hostage abroad and actually used against
us."
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia was relatively prosperous when we were attacked (by
the crisis). Suddenly we found our wealth diminishing... Our
initial inability to counter the attacks... showed that we have
not understood what is meant by globalization," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Learning the lesson has been very costly to us," he added.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was also addressed by Iran's First Vice President
Hassan Habibi, Indonesian Coordination Minister for People's
Welfare and Poverty Eradication Haryono Suyono, Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amre M. Moussa and Nigeria's Minister Plenipotentiary
A.A. Isa.
</P>
<P>
The D-8 summit, which was originally scheduled for November
last year but was postponed because of the devastating flood
hitting Bangladesh from July and September, will end Tuesday
afternoon after adopting a Dhaka Declaration.

<HEADLINE> Macao SAR Preparatory Committee's Sixth Meeting Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Sixth Meeting of the
Preparatory Committee of the Macao Special Administrative Region (
SAR) opened in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing today's opening ceremony, Qian Qichen, vice premier
and chairman of the Macao SAR's Preparatory Committee, said that
applications by Macao residents for membership in the Selection
Committee which will select the first chief executive of the Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR) have been completed.
</P>
<P>
This process was warmly received by people from all walks of
life in Macao and indicates the great enthusiasm of Macao
residents as they anticipate the establishment of the Macao SAR,
he said.
</P>
<P>
A major task of the Preparatory Committee in the six weeks
after the Fifth Meeting was the work of accepting applications for
the Selection Committee for the first government of the Macao SAR,
a process that began on January 26 and lasted for 20 days.
</P>
<P>
Application for members in the Selection Committee marks the
beginning of participation in a democratic election by Macao
residents in their capacity as masters of the State for the first
time in its history. This is a major event in Macao's history,
Qian said.
</P>
<P>
During the current meeting, Qian said, Preparatory Committee
members will select candidates for the Selection Committee from a
list of the 2,200 applicants.
</P>
<P>
"We have always advocated that the Selection Committee should
be made up of people from all social sectors, including foreign
nationals with the right of permanent residence in Macao," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian urged participants to put forward a list of candidates in
accordance with the overall and long-term interests of the people
of Macao.
</P>
<P>
As the number of applicants is nine times larger than the
number that will be selected, the act of participation shows
support for the return of Macao to the motherland, no matter
whether or not any particular applicant is selected, he said.

<HEADLINE> World Largest Canyon Accurately Surveyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- An accurate survey and
calculations have shown that the Yarlung Zangbo Canyon on the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is 504.6 kilometers long and 6,009 meters
deep at its lowest point, the State Bureau of Surveying and
Mapping has announced.
</P>
<P>
These figures, based on data collected during an expedition to
the canyon last year, show that it is longer and deeper than
previously thought, said Wang Chunfeng, deputy director of the
bureau.
</P>
<P>
A group of Chinese scientists surveyed the canyon in 1994 and
determined its length to be 496.3 kilometers and its deepest point
5,382 meters, making it the world's longest and deepest canyon.
</P>
<P>
Before that, the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States
and the Canyon of Cerro Colca in Peru were considered the longest
and deepest canyons in the world, respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, because of technical problems the data gathered by
Chinese scientists in the early 1990s was not completely accurate.
</P>
<P>
One of the important tasks of the expedition team last year was
to measure the canyon with the Global Positioning System and other
modern scientific methods in order to update and correct the data.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Vows to Solve Peace Problem in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
vowed on Monday to put an end to the peace and order problem in
Mindanao, hopeful that the hostilities in the area could be
stopped in just six months.
</P>
<P>
The president, who was visiting General Santos City in the
southern Philippines, also announced his decision to close the
door on the possibility of meeting face to face with Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) chief Hashim Salamat, unless the agenda is
confined to the issue of economic development of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Estrada admitted that the peace and order problem in Mindanao
remains the biggest concern of the Armed Forces of the Philippines
(AFP) and the Philippine National Police (PNP).
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that AFP and PNP members will help
restore peace and order there. "We will impose the rule of law in
this country and we will defend our constitution at all cost," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive said he will no longer react to statements
made by MILF leader Salamat on the demands of his group in
negotiating peace with the government.
</P>
<P>
"I will just waste my time answering what he is saying," he
said, commenting on Salamat's warning that the MILF may engage in
an expanded war, unless the group can come to an agreement with
the government on its demand for a separate Islamic state.

<HEADLINE> China to Hold Quality Authentication Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China will hold an exhibition of
its achievements in quality authentication in the field of foreign
trade in early October.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference today, the State Administration for Entry-
Exit Inspection and Quarantine, the exhibit's organizer, announced
that the show will display the structure and operations of the
administration, which is in charge of quality authentication for
importers and exporters and their merchandise.
</P>
<P>
The exhibit will also introduce companies, products, and
laboratories which have received authentication from the
administration.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, according to statistics released by
the administration, 41 authentication institutions were approved
by the administration to conduct quality authentication on imports

<HEADLINE> Angolan Ambassador Complains about Zambia's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Ambassador to Zambia Manuel
Augusto has expressed his dissatisfaction with Zambian
government's "passive" approach in dealing with the bombing
incidents in Lusaka, according to Monday's official Angola Daily.
</P>
<P>
A bomb exploded Sunday in front of the Angolan embassy in the
northeast of the Zambian capital Lusaka, killing one guard on
impact and injuring another. The embassy's two-storey building
was also seriously damaged by the explosion.
</P>
<P>
Augusto claimed that the local government did not send a
policeman to the spot until about seven hours after the bombing.
Some witnesses said the Zambian police dissolved another bomb from
the Angolan embassy afterward.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador noted that the passive attitude of the Zambian
government indicated that it does not intend to take up effective
protection measures toward Angolan embassy.
</P>
<P>
Relation between Angola and Zambia has been increasingly tense
recently, with Angolan government accusing repeatedly the Zambian
government of allowing the opposition National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) to use its territories to obtain
illegally weapons and logistics resources, which Zambia firmly
denied.
</P>
<P>
Reports said there were two other bombing incidents in Lusaka
Sunday. One in the rich Rhodes Pak in the suburbs of the capital
Lusaka which had destroyed the wall of a residence; the other near
the water pipe in Chilanga. So far the police have not confirmed
the perpetrators of the bombing or their intentions.

BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Officials at various levels should
try to improve themselves, their political quality in particular,
and enhance their capabilities through conscientious study, Hu
Jintao said here today.
</P>
<P>
Hu, a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), said that
facing new situations and missions, there is a strict request that
officials at all levels grasp the opportunity, overcome
difficulties, and accept challenges.
</P>
<P>
He asked that officials strengthen their study and combine
Marxism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory and the cream of
the Party's 15th National Conference together in the process of
learning.
</P>
<P>
Hu made these remark at today's opening ceremony of the spring
term of the Party School of the CPC Central Committee where he
briefed officials on the comprehensive arrangements of the Central
Government for this year's work.
</P>
<P>
Hu asked these officials to explore every avenue of knowledge,
and stressed that they should attach importance to fresh learning
that reflects new developments in world politics, economy and
culture in order to keep apace of the changing times.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee's Party School enrolled 753 officials

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- India's trade deficit in the
current fiscal year (April 1, 1998-March 31, 1999) has been
widened to 7.79 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Exports during April-January of the current fiscal were
estimated at 27.16 billion dollars against 27.7 billion dollars
for the same period of the previous fiscal, said the trade data
released here Monday by the Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
India's exports, which have been registering negative growth
since the beginning of the fiscal, witnessed a turnaround in
November when it increased by 3.35 percent and the momentum
continued in December and January 1999 when it rose by 6.73
percent and 8.5 percent respectively, the data said.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Minister R. Hedge has said recently that the decline
of the country's exports had been arrested and India was likely to
register a 4- to 5-percent export growth in the current fiscal.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, India had set a 20-percent growth for the current
fiscal's export target. In 1995, India's exports grew by 25
percent. But since then the country's exports have declined
sharply.

<HEADLINE> Greater Efforts Urged To Prevent Financial Risks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Dai Xianglong, governor of the
People's Bank of China (PBOC), China's central bank, expressed his
hope here today that developed countries will take more
responsibility for preventing financial risks in the process of
financial globalization.
</P>
<P>
Dai made the remark at the opening of a two-day international
symposium on strengthening the banking systems. He said he hopes
developed countries will give full consideration to the actual
conditions of developing countries and allow them to make step-by-
step progress.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the wish that International Monetary Fund and
banks will step up efforts to improve their operating systems
under the principles of transparency and opening-up.
</P>
<P>
He also urged them to tighten controls on short-term capital
flow in order to maintain abundant capital resources and enhance
their capacity to fend off financial risks.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that international financial institutions should
strictly follow the Basle core principles for effective
supervision and establish sound supervisory systems in their
countries.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that greater efforts should be made in the
management of multinational financial institutions and the
supervision of hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
Dai also discussed China's current financial reforms and said
that the country has basically established a new banking system
and taken effective measures to deal with inflation and deflation.
Currently, China enjoys a stable yuan and sufficient foreign
reserves, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the supervision of a country's banking system
should fit its national conditions, and China's adoption of
separate operations for banks, trust firms and securities
institutions has proven to be suitable for China's national
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, held jointly by the PBOC and the Bank for
International Settlement, is being attended by 130 high-profile
financial leaders from both China and abroad.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
called for the international community to make concerted efforts
to help landmine-affected countries in a statement here Monday
marking the entry into force of the Ottawa Convention banning anti-
personnel mines.
</P>
<P>
"Landmines represented and still represent a major public
health threat," said WHO Director-General Dr. Gro Harlem
Brundtland.
</P>
<P>
"We need to develop clear strategies to strengthen the health
sector, including rehabilitation of services in mine affected
countries," she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"We need to do it together," Brundtland said, "WHO cannot
assume this task alone, but the months since September have
strengthened our conviction that we can do a lot more together."
</P>
<P>
In September 1998, she recalled, the First WHO Inter-Regional
Workshop on Concerted Public Health Response to Anti-personnel
Mines was held in Kampala, Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting were representatives of health
ministries from 10 African countries (Angola, Burundi, Djibouti,
Eritrea, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan and Uganda),
WHO officials, as well as delegates of other parts of the United
Nations and a number of Non-Governmental Organizations.
</P>
<P>
The WHO chief expressed hope that the partnership forged at the
meeting would be expanded to Asia and America in the coming months.

<HEADLINE> China Making Effort To Deal With Unemployment Problem (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because the increase in the number of laid off people has begun
to hinder economic development and affect social stability, the
Chinese government has looked for solutions to the problem. In the
past year, 6.09 million people, or half the number of people laid
off, have found new jobs.
</P>
<P>
China has set up re-employment centers to provide benefits and
training for them, and by the end of 1998, the centers had covered
99 percent of these people.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Labor and Social Security has listed community
service as a major source of jobs for these laborers. China's
service sector now employs 26.8 percent of the laborers.
</P>
<P>
Hu suggests that China adopt development methods that rely less
on capital and more on labor and says that high economic growth is
not the ultimate goal and that creating more job opportunities
while maintaining relatively high economic growth is the thing.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences suggests that the
government make a greater effort to develop education, especially
adult education, to take the pressure off and that it consider
increasing schoolroom adult education in combination with new jobs.

The increasingly serious polarization in terms of the
distribution of wealth has led to a growing poverty rate.
Statistics show that 16 percent of the U.S. population lived below
the poverty line in 1974, with the figure rising to 19 percent in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Hunger accompanies poverty. A large number of Americans
continue to suffer from hunger in spite of the fact that the U.S.
ranks as one of the world's leading grain producers with annual
production of over 160 million tons.

The over 30 million U.S. citizens suffering from hunger in 1990

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Democratic Reform in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The democratic reform in Tibet
started in March 1959, after the People's Liberation Army put down
an armed rebellion launched by the Tibetan local upper class
reactionary clique.
</P>
<P>
The reform put an end to the clerical-aristocratic dictatorship
combining political and religious rule that had long plagued Tibet,
and rendered freedom to the serfs and slaves that made up 95
percent of the region's population.
</P>
<P>
The democratic reform was carried out in two stages. The first
step was to launch a movement against the three evils (counter-
revolutionary rebellion, corvee labor system and personal
appendage system) as well as to bring about reductions of rent and
interest.
</P>
<P>
The second step was the confiscation of the means of production
of the rebellious suzerains and the distribution of them among the
poor peasants and herdsmen; as to the means of production of other
suzerains, the state adopted the policy of redemption and their
free distribution among poor peasants and herdsmen, ordinary
peasants and herd owners.
</P>
<P>
The democratic reform, which was necessary for the social
progress of Tibet, reflected the strong desire and basic interests
of the more than one million serfs. After that, Tibet began to
enter a new era of social and human rights progress.

<HEADLINE> Manila Says No Absolute Immunity for Marcoses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Monday that the judicial approval of the 150-million-U.S.-dollar
settlement between human rights victims and the Marcos family will
neither exonerate the Marcoses of human rights abuses nor cloak
them with immunity from civil and criminal suits.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, Presidential Spokesman Jerry
Barican said all other cases initiated by the government and
individual complainants will not be affected by the accord signed
recently by the Marcos family and the lawyers of the human rights
victims.
</P>
<P>
The government efforts to recover the alleged ill-gotten wealth
of the late President Ferdinand Marcos will be "doubled" so that
the money can be used to bankroll the administration's pro-poor
projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If there is a clause providing for a so-called immunity from
civil and criminal suits in the agreement in question, such
immunity or waiver of rights is compartmentalized, limited and
exclusive," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the waiver is only binding to the named
complainants who filed, and won, a class suit against the Marcos
estate for torture, summary executions and disappearances before a
Honolulu court.
</P>
<P>
Barican said the remaining balance of 440 million dollars in an
escrow account with the Philippine National Bank will not be
released to the Marcoses since "this account is ill-gotten and
should revert to the national treasury."
</P>
<P>
"The government and other non-parties to the suit that have
causes of action against the Marcoses are not precluded from
filing separate criminal and civil suits against them with respect
to other monies or properties illegally obtained by the Marcos
family," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Barican said that there will be no absolution or exoneration of
the Marcoses in this compromise deal.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is exclusively between the Marcos family and the
10,000 human rights claimants named in the class suit, he said.

The plight of children in the U.S. is not gratifying. The
country has the highest proportion of children who die from
shooting incidents among the 26 richest countries in the world,
with more than 7,000 children killed by gunshot wounds each year.
</P>
<P>
Many children have to do heavy and dangerous work for low wages.
In 1996, there were 290,000 illegally employed children in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Children also suffer from poverty in the U.S.. Statistics show
that 15 million children still live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
The United States often criticizes other countries for applying
lower human rights protection standards than international
standards, but it does not follow international standards itself.
The United States does not recognize the priority application
right of the international law, and the Federal Government refuses
to implement international conventions nationwide, but allows its
states to go their own way.
</P>
<P>
The United States does not have a good human rights record
itself but likes to play the role of the "world's human rights
policeman" and makes unwarranted accusations about other countries,
resulting in strenuous objections and resistance by other
countries.
</P>
<P>
In the end, the article said that the American government needs
to keep its eyes on its own human rights situation, mind its own
business, and avoid interfering in the internal affairs of other
countries.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman On Pentagon's Missile Threat Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China resents and strongly opposes
"the so-called" Chinese missile threat to Taiwan as reported by
the U.S. Defense Department, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhu
Bangzao said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon recently submitted the report to the U.S. Congress
to make an excuse to sell advanced weapons to Taiwan, Zhu said,
calling this "serious interference in China's internal affairs".
</P>
<P>
He said that, because Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese
territory, the Taiwan issue is an internal affair of China's and
no foreign power has the right to interfere.
</P>
<P>
"We urge the United States to observe the principles of the
three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and its own promises on dealing
with the Taiwan issue," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. should treat the Taiwan issue properly
and gradually reduce the number of arms sales and ultimately stop
them and not do anything counter to China's reunification cause.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon report claimed that the Chinese mainland is
putting a lot into research and deployment of advanced guided
missiles, thereby posing a missile threat to Taiwan.

BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Qian Qichen told the
6th plenary meeting of the Macao SAR Preparatory Committee here
today that relations between the Macao Special Administrative
Region (SAR) and Taiwan will be a component of cross-Straits
relations like the ties between the Hong Kong SAR and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that Macao-Taiwan contacts that involve state
sovereignty and cross-Straits relations will have to be arranged
by the Central Government or handled by the Macao SAR government
under Central Government guidance.
</P>
<P>
Non-governmental relations between the Macao SAR and Taiwan and
the rights and interests of Macao and Taiwan compatriots will be
protected, according to Qian, who is chairman of the Preparatory
Committee.
</P>
<P>
He summarized recent domestic and overseas media coverage of
the 4th anniversary of President Jiang Zemin's Eight-Point
Proposal on the Taiwan issue and the 20th anniversary of the
Message to Taiwan Compatriots, and emphasized the one-China
principle and Taiwan's status as a part of China.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Taiwanese authorities will go along
with today's trends and do something helpful to cross-Straits
relations.

<HEADLINE> Human Rights Records in United States (16) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Black people in the United States do not as yet enjoy equal
rights in terms of participating in government affairs. A study
report released in January 1997 by a Washington-based criminal
verdict research center showed that 1.46 million black men out of
the total 10.4 million eligible black voters had been deprived of
their right to vote after being convicted of felonies. This means
that one of every seven eligible black voters loses the right to
vote after receiving severe court penalties (21).
</P>
<P>
Statistics for 1998 provided by the Human Rights Watch
indicated that U.S. adults stripped of the right to vote account
for some two percent of the country's total, and nevertheless, the
number of blacks deprived of the right to vote accounted for 13
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
One-third of the blacks in Alabama and Florida were deprived of
their right to vote in the 1996 elections. Human Rights Watch
predicts that some 30 to 40 percent of the next generation of
black people in the U.S. will permanently lose their right to vote
if the current situation remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The Voting Rights Act enacted in 1965 authorized the Department
of Justice to monitor elections in various southern states and
required certain states to designate as many as possible
constituencies where black voters account for a majority.
Nonetheless, the actual situation proves the contrary. Some states
have resorted to redistricting the constituencies to restrict the
black people's participation in government affairs.
</P>
<P>
For example, the local government in Jackson city of
Mississippi, responded to the threat that blacks would soon become
the city's majority population by redistricting constituencies to
divide and diminish their power by moving them to districts with a
majority of white people. The city has resorted to similar action
on several occasions since 1960.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A signed article by Ren Yanshi
entitled "Human Rights Records in the United States" was published
here today, pointing out that the United States does not have a
good human rights record itself, but likes to play the role of the
"world's human rights policeman" and makes unwarranted accusations
about other countries.
</P>
<P>
Refering to the "1998 Human Rights Report" issued by the United
States on February 26, the article said the United States once
again poses as a "human rights judge," and attacks the human
rights records of more than 190 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Ignoring the actual situation, the U.S. report blames China for
committing "widespread and well documented human rights abuses,"
but did not say a single word about the human rights problems in
the United States, the article said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the U.S., which often grades human rights records of
other countries, wins low marks from its own people and the
international community.
</P>
<P>
The United States is a country where violent crimes are most
serious in the world. On average, 65 people die and more than 6,
000 people become disabled by violent crimes every day.
</P>
<P>
The United States has more firearms in the hands of individuals
than any other country in the world.
</P>
<P>
Though the U.S. government claims that the number of violent
crimes has been reduced in recent years, an investigation
indicates that 61 percent of Americans believe that the crime
problem has become more and more serious, and 68 percent expect a
higher crime rate in year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The United States calls itself the "Free World". The
proportion of prisoners in the United States, however, tops the
world.
</P>
<P>
A report issued by the U.S. Department of Justice on August 17,
1997, said that the number of people who committed crimes and
received sentences in the United States in 1996 hit a record 5.5
million.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Urges Rebels to Assist Mindanao Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
Monday urged the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) to help his
administration in its efforts to accelerate Mindanao's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
In an interview in General Santos City, Mindanao, Estrada said
that he will address the issues raised by MILF Chairman Hashim
Salamat only if the rebel group manifests its resolve to help his
administration lead Mindanao to lasting peace and progress.
</P>
<P>
"I have my last appeal to them before anything else, I am
asking them and inviting them to join hands with the government in
the development of Mindanao. We will not answer what they are
asking now. We will only answer them if they are willing to join
us in the development of Mindanao," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he will exert all efforts to pursue the quest for
lasting peace in the South, as peace and order is a vital
component of any economic development program.
</P>
<P>
Estrada and MILF Chairman Salamat were scheduled to meet in
Cotabato City over the weekend but the meeting was aborted because
of some disagreement over certain issues like security
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The president said he is not closing the door to peace
negotiations with MILF rebels despite the cancellation of his
meeting with Salamat.
</P>
<P>
During the past 20 years, the MILF has been fighting for an
independent Islamic state in the south. But the government has
insisted that the territorial integrity is unnegotiable.

Jails in the United States are in poor condition and prisoners
are ill-treated there.
</P>
<P>
Violence is prevalent in U.S. jails. Prisoners are maltreated
not only by fellow prisoners, but also by prison guards.
</P>
<P>
The United States also arbitrarily enforces the death penalty
without justice, and jury verdicts are often affected by race and
economic status.
</P>
<P>
The United States is one of only six remaining countries in the
world that imposes the death penalty on juveniles.
</P>
<P>
The number of minors sentenced to death in the United States
exceeds any other country. Since 1990, eight teenagers who
committed crimes when they were under 18 years old have been
executed, and 60 other juveniles are now awaiting execution.
</P>
<P>
Controlling state power has always been the privilege of a
small number of wealthy U.S. citizens. Approximately half of the
cabinet members have personal assets of over one million U.S.
dollars, with some reporting family assets of over 80 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Even in the Congress, the proportion of millionaires to the
total number of legislators is dozens of times higher than the
level for U.S. society as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The United States always glorifies its freedom of press.
However, freedom of press in the U.S. is nothing more than a myth.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the American Society of Newspaper Editors
in 1998 revealed that 78 percent of the public pointed to the
overly biased viewpoints of the press, while 80 percent indicated
that newspapers dramatize some news items for commercial purposes,
with over 75 percent citing suspicions that some news lacks
credible sources.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Seventy people, 90 percent of them civilians, are mutilated
each day by anti-personnel landmines around the world. It is for
this reason that the convention on banning anti-personnel
landmines, signed in Ottawa in December 1997, came into force
since Monday. The United States, China, and Russia are yet to sign
the convention.
</P>
<P>
-- Within the reach of the cannons of Serbia, French President
Jacques Chirac launched on Sunday a solemn warning to the two
belligerent sides of Kosovo. Chirac said that if any side rejects
the choice of peace, it would bear extremely serious and damaging
consequences in political, economic and military fields.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The Ottawa treaty on banning anti-personnel landmines came
into force on Monday. Humanitarian organizations which have led
the crusade against "the weapon of cowards" said an irreversible
movement has been staged with the aim of the disappearance of a
scourge which harms one person every 20 minutes in the world.
</P>
<P>
-- The reformers close to Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
largely dominated the municipal elections held on Friday in Iran
by coming on top in Teheran as well as most of the regions of the
country, according to the primary results published on Sunday.

VI. Ignoring International Conventions on Human Rights
</P>
<P>
The United States often criticizes other countries for applying
lower human rights protection standards than international
standards, but it does not follow international standards itself.
The United States does not recognize the priority application
right of the international law, and the Federal Government refuses
to implement international conventions nationwide, but allows its
states to go their own way.
</P>
<P>
The United States is one of only two countries not to join the
Convention on the Rights of the Child (the other being Somalia)
and is one of the few not to join the Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.
</P>
<P>
The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of
Genocide is the first major international human rights convention
the U.S. joined, but it was only approved in 1988, whereas the U.S.
signed it in 1948. Another convention, the International
Convention on Eliminating All Forms of Racial Discrimination, was
approved in 1994, after being signed by the U.S. in 1966. The
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was approved
in 1992, and the U.S. signed it in 1977. Approval of the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is
still pending and it was signed in 1977.
</P>
<P>
Although it is one of the founding members of the Organization
of American States, the United States refuses to either approve
the American Convention on Human Rights, or sign other human
rights conventions the organization has approved.

<TEXT>
<P>
When it joined the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights and the Convention against Torture and Other
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the U.S. said
that it would only implement the two within the limits of its own
laws, which makes joining meaningless.
</P>
<P>
The United States has many reservations about the former, some
of them considered by the United Nations Human Rights Committee in
conflict with international law and the principles of the covenant.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. also tried to put obstacles to the path of drafting
the optional protocol on the Convention on the Rights of the Child
by the United Nations, establishing the International Criminal
Court and the land mine issue Ottawa process and other issues.
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. approved the Convention against Torture and
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in 1994,
it has not yet handed in a report on implementing it nor the first
and second reports on implementing the International Convention on
the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which
should be handed in by November 1995 and November 1997.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. gave the cold shoulder to the visit request by UN
Human Rights Committee special rapporteurs and did not pay due
attention to suggestions made during and after their visit.
</P>
<P>
The United States does not have a good human rights record
itself but likes to play the role of the "world's human rights
policeman" and makes unwarranted accusations about other countries,
resulting in strenuous objections and resistance by other
countries.
</P>
<P>
The American government needs to keep its eyes on its own human
rights situation, mind its own business, and avoid interfering in
the internal affairs of other countries.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Continue Falling in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices fell for the second
straight trading day Monday, mainly because of a decline in high-
tech blue chips following the U.S. dollar's fall against the yen.
</P>
<P>
Selling pressure from the unwinding of cross-shareholdings by
institutional investors ahead of the March book-closing also
dampened share prices, traders said.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 145.79 points, or 1.01
percent, from last Friday's close to end at 14,221.75.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, dropped 12.22 points or 1.09 percent to 1,
107.81.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section decreased to 420.18 million
shares from 469.03 million shares Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nippon Steel was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
The dollar, which briefly sank as low as 118.85 yen in the
morning, traded at 118.98-119.01 yen at 3 p.m. local time, down
from 120.30-33 yen late Friday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Export-oriented high-tech issues were also driven down by
Friday's decline on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial
Average fell for the fourth straight day, closing at 9,306.58,
traders said.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers outpaced
gainers 707 to 435, with 165 issues ending unchanged.

United States in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries index Monday closed trading 31.2
points, or 1.08 percent higher at 2,911.1 points and not far off

planning a takeover of Australia's third biggest phone company.
</P>
<P>
Rival Telstra climbed 28.4 cents and Cable &AMP; Wireless Optus
jumped nine cents.

<P>
Insurance giant AMP bounced up 36.6 cents, after being sold
down after its profit announcement last week, Colonial climbed 9.6
cents while National Mutual added seven cents.
</P>
<P>
The banking sector was dominated by a strong performance from
National Australia Bank which added 45 cents.
</P>
<P>
Among the other big four, Westpac slipped 4.7 cents, ANZ was 10
firmer while the Commonwealth climbed 25.
</P>
<P>

<P>
The biggest underperformers were again in the resources sector
with BHP off 19 cents with the stock seen under pressure in the
short term as the resources giant begins to unwind the
controversial holding company Beswick Pty Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The gold index added 5.5 points to 1,008.6. The spot price of
gold bullion in Sydney was 0.30 higher at 286.70 U.S. dollars an

<HEADLINE> About 4,000 NATO Troops Already Deployed in Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- NATO has already deployed 4,000
troops in Macedonia to implement a peace agreement in the
neighboring Yugoslav province of Kosovo which might be reached
between Kosovo ethnic Albanians and Serb authorities, the Albanian
radio reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The troops came from 10 western countries, mostly from Britain
and France, and will enter the Yugoslav province once a peace
agreement is signed.
</P>
<P>
Of the NATO troops, the 1,700-strong rapid reaction forces from
France, Britain, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands will provide
protection for the observers of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Serbian and ethnic Albanian delegations in principle agreed to
the peace agreement proposed by the West for the settlement of the
Kosovo crisis on February 23. NATO will send 30,000 troops to
Kosovo to monitor agreement implementation.
</P>
<P>
The Rambouillet talks are scheduled to resume on March 15 when
the western countries are expected to force the conflicting
parties to sign the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Slides Below 62 U.S. Cents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar shed half a
U.S. cent Monday to close below 62 U.S. cents for the first time
in almost two months.
</P>
<P>
Negative sentiment pushed the local currency lower and weak
commodity prices and U.S. selling fed the bears.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed off its lows for the session at
61.83 U.S. cents, down from Friday night's local close of 62.33,
during the session it dipped to 61.65 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Worse-than-expected trade data released Monday blocked a move
by the currency back toward the 62.00-U.S.-cent level.
</P>
<P>
"We tried to get a rally back to 62.00 but then the number came
out and the market used that as another opportunity to sell," said
St. George Bank manager of foreign exchange trading Stuart Moore.
</P>
<P>
January balance on goods and services data released by the
Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed the trade deficit blew
out to a record level.
</P>
<P>
A seasonally adjusted deficit of 1.379 billion Australian
dollars (852.2 million U.S. dollars) in January was markedly worse
than economists' expectations.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Bank economist Michael Blythe said the likelihood
that Tuesday's current account data will show a widening deficit
and rising foreign debt in the forth quarter is likely to weigh on
the currency over the next few days.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Australian dollar was trading at 0.5608 euro
from 0.5673 euro Friday and the euro was trading at 1.1023 U.S.
dollars from 1.0973.
</P>
<P>
The local currency was buying 73.55 Japanese yen from 75.18
yen.

Thailand, beginning from Tuesday, the Thai government announced
Monday.
</P>
<P>
During her visit here, Albright is scheduled to meet her Thai

</P>
<P>
It is reported that Surin will also lobby Albright for more
U.S. help to resolve market access for Thai exports and call for
more U.S. investment in Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Should Decide Its Own Way Out of Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
Monday said Indonesia should decide on its own the efforts that
would get the country out of its current economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We have to find out all the solutions that could help us get
out of this crisis," Habibie told 200 German businessmen at the
opening ceremony of the German products and services exhibition
Technogerma here. The exhibition runs until March 7.
</P>
<P>
The president said the crisis has dealt many negative impacts
on the country.
</P>
<P>
"(Indonesia's) gross national product (GNP) decreased from
1,055 U.S. dollars in 1997 to 400 U.S. dollars in 1998, while
cumulative inflation reached 77.63 percent in 1998," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has reached 15.4 million or
17.1 percent of the country's total workforce and the number of
poor families increased to 40 percent of the total 200 million
population.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that the government has been taking many
strategic measures to bail the country out of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Insya Allah (if God wishes so), the (weakening) of the economy
would stop this year and we could start a new phase of (our) life
next year," the head of state said.
</P>
<P>
He cited that the rupiah's exchange rate has strengthened from
10,000 rupiah to the U.S. dollar in the past months to 8,500-8,700
rupiah to the U.S. dollar recently.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has also achieved much progress in
stemming the rising price of basic commodities.
</P>
<P>
Habibie said the government will continue to carry out various
strategic measures, including the elimination of corrupt,
collusive and nepotistic practices, in an effort to rebuild the
confidence of the international market in Indonesia as well as to
lure back foreign investors to the country.
</P>
<P>
On Indonesia's bilateral relations with Germany, Habibie said
German investment here has reached only 3.7 percent of the total
value of foreign investments, putting Germany in the 10th place
among 59 foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
To boost the two countries' economic and trade ties, Habibie
urged German businessmen to increase their investments and exports
to Indonesia.

<P>
KATHMANDU, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A Nepali Congress candidate for
the election to the House of Representatives said that he is ready
to vacate his candidacy for party President and Prime Minister
Girija Prasad Koirala's daughter Sujata, who alleged that there
was a major conspiracy in the party to deny her a ticket.
</P>
<P>
Chandra Prasad Shrestha, who was picked up by the Nepali
Congress to contest the May election in No. 1 constituency of
Sunsari district, eastern Nepal, said in a statement that he is

the demand of the people, the official RSS news agency reported

Shrestha said he was very sad that the party had not provided a
ticket to Sujata, who is likely to win the election with
overwhelming votes.
</P>
<P>

There is still serious gender discrimination in the United
States and the U.S. Constitution does not contain any provision
for equality between men and women.
</P>
<P>
Females make up 50.94 percent of the country's population, but
only 10.4 percent of the members of Congress are females,
according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
There is also gender discrimination in the workplace and
females account for two-thirds of the country's jobless. The
underemployment rate among women is almost two times the average
in the U.S., and re-employment among them is much lower than for
men.
</P>
<P>
Most females are employed in the service sector on a temporary
or part-time basis. Females do not get equal pay for equal work,
resulting in an widening gap between the incomes of men and women.
</P>
<P>
A Bureau of Labor Statistics study showed that mid-level wages
of full-time female employees were 75 percent those of males.
There are fewer women doing high-tech work than men, and their
incomes are much lower, according to the January 23, 1997 issue of
USA Today. Salaries of female mathematicians, physicists, and
engineers with higher degrees are only 17 percent those of males,
and in the computer industry they are only 14 percent those of
males.
</P>
<P>
From 1990 to 1995, American women earned 71 or 72 cents on
average for each dollar earned by men, according to the Christian
Science Monitor's April 11, 1997 issue. An ordinary woman would
earn 500,000 dollars less than a man in her lifetime.

The plight of children in the U.S. is not entirely gratifying.
The country has the highest proportion of children who die from
shooting incidents among the 26 richest countries in the world,
with more than 7,000 children killed by gunshot wounds each year.
</P>
<P>
A study by the Washington-based Children's Defence Fund
released in March of 1997 said that one person below the age of 20
is killed by a gun every ninety minutes and children below the age
of 15 die are 12 times more likely to be killed by a gun than in
25 other industrialized countries combined.
</P>
<P>
Child abuse is a serious problem in the U.S. Every ten seconds
a child is either abused or suffering from neglect, and each year,
about 130,000 children suffer from sexual abuse, 2,000 children
die from abuse, and 250,000 are physically attacked.
</P>
<P>
A government survey report released on January 11 showed that
the number of children suffering from abuse or neglect increased
from 1.4 million in 1986 to more than 3 million in 1997. Each year,
1,046 children die from maltreatment and lack of proper care and
the younger the child is the more susceptible to physical abuse it
is. About 82 percent of the children killed are below the age of
five, and nearly 44 percent are one or younger (28).

Many children have to do heavy and dangerous work for low wages.
In 1996, there were 290,000 illegally employed children in the U.S.
Of 165 children found to be illegally employed in 16 states, the
youngest was only four.
</P>
<P>
Children also suffer from poverty in the U.S.. Statistics show

A study by a Survey Center of Poor Children of Columbia
University published in December of 1997 found that the number of
children below the age of six living in poverty increased from the
3.5 million in 1979 to 6.1 million in 1995. The poverty rate for
children has soared from 18 percent to 25 percent, which means one
out of every four of them is living in poverty.

<HEADLINE> U.S. May Lose Credibility in Middle East, Arab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. may lose its
credibility in the Middle East if it continues to side with
Israel, the visiting head of a Washington-based association
said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Khalil Jahshan, the president of the National Assiciation of
Arab Americans, said the U.S. policy may incur such a loss if
Israel continues to possess weapons of mass destruction while Arab
nations are denied access to them.
</P>
<P>
"We are for a Middle East region free of weapons of mass
destruction across the board including Israel," Jahshan after
meeting with Sheikh Saqr, a member from Ras al-Khaimah of the
Supreme Council of Rulers.
</P>
<P>
Jahshan said he is concerned about the future relations between
the U.S. and Arab nations which are plagued by some "inherent
contradictions."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. policy makers tend to look at every issue in the
region through an Israeli prism instead of as a matter of common
concern to the U.S. and its Arab allies, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has mismanaged the Mideast peace process which is now
in an impasse, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the U.S. government to clarify its objectives
toward Iraq, adding that it is the people living in this region
who are "going to bear the burden and results of confrontation
with Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The Arab Americans are concerned about the continuation of the
economic sanctions on Iraq, particularly their impacts on the
Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Jahshan is on a Mideast tour which has also already taken him
to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Bahrain.

Although the U.S. leads the world in terms of average family
income, the income gap between the rich and poor has nonetheless
reached the greatest point in the past two decades. Increased work
hours have, in fact, been accompanied by falling incomes.
</P>
<P>
Various surveys show that the average work week for an American
jumped from 40.6 hours in 1973 to 50.6 hours in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The current income level for the top 20 percent of the
population is nine times more than the figure for the bottom 20
percent, up significantly from the 3.5 times figure in 1979. In
addition, some 75 percent of American workers earn less today than
in 1979. (14)
</P>
<P>
Speaking from the perspective of income distribution, an
economist from the University of California in Berkeley said the U.
S. faces greater problems than it did 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The increasingly serious polarization in terms of the
distribution of wealth has led to a growing poverty rate.
Statistics show that 16 percent of the U.S. population lived below
the poverty line in 1974, with the figure rising to 19 percent in
1997.
</P>
<P>
A quarter of those U.S. citizens who are over the age of 25 and
have not received a high school education are living below the
poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Poverty has greatly affected the health and education of the
poor. A report released by the U.S. National Center for Health
Statistics in July 1998 said the possibility of illness the poor
face is seven times that for the rich. In addition, the expected
life-span of a 45-year-old with an annual income of 25,000 U.S.
dollars is 6.6 years longer than that for an individual with an
annual income of 10,000 dollars. (15)

Information released by the U.S. General Accounting Office
shows that tuition levels for four-year public universities soared
by 256 percent during 1980-1995 period, while the income level for
ordinary families grew by only 93 percent. This in turn resulted
in a further decline in the rate of poor people receiving higher
education.
</P>
<P>
Hunger accompanies poverty. A large number of Americans
continue to suffer from hunger in spite of the fact that the U.S.
ranks as one of the world's leading grain producers with annual
production of over 160 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The over 30 million U.S. citizens suffering from hunger in 1990
accounted for 12 percent of the nation's total population.
</P>
<P>
A report released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture on
September 15, 1997, said financial factors forced 4.2 million
American families to reduce spending on food between 1994 and 1995,
with some 12 million families threatened with inadequate food
support.
</P>
<P>
The leader of an anti-hunger organization said the hunger rate
in the U.S. has surged by 50 percent over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the number of homeless people is also on the rise.
A recent survey conducted in 29 U.S. cities showed that six of
every 10 cities have witnessed increasing numbers of homeless
people. The survey results released at the American Conference of
Mayors in 1997 showed that New York alone had 45,000 homeless
people.

Workers in New York and Hawaii, on the other hand, must work 119

The U.S. continues to reduce welfare expenditures in spite of
ongoing economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The number of U.S. citizens receiving welfare benefits fell
seven percent during the first six months after the country's new
welfare bill went into effect in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The number of welfare recipients fell 22 percent from 14.4
million in March 1994 to 11.2 million in March 1997, according to
a June 1997 report in U.S.A. Today. (18)
</P>
<P>
Almost all states reduced welfare benefits to families with
minor children during the 1993-1996 period. Four states reduced
benefits by more than 40 percent, with the Wisconsin reduction
standing at 55 percent. An additional 27 states cut relief
payments by 20-39 percent. (19)
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is the only industrialized large country which has not
as yet adopted a compulsory medical insurance system. Reports from

JOHANNESBURG, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Crime tops the priority list
South Africans have set for the government to tackle in the next
ten years.
</P>
<P>
A survey, conducted by the Human Science Research Council in
December last year, revealed that 41 percent of the 2,200
respondents put crime prevention on top of the list, The Citizen
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Job creation took second place with 32 percent, followed by the
 improvement of local services and education.
</P>
<P>
The results of the survey were released Sunday, according to
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
In racial breakdown, nearly two thirds (64 percent) of whites
surveyed had put crime prevention at the top of their lists,
compared with 37 percent among blacks.
</P>
<P>
Job creation weighed slightly heavier among blacks as blacks
were hardest hit by unemployment.
</P>
<P>
According to additional data, feelings of personal safety had
deteriorated substantially since 1994, but the trend seemed to be
stabilizing.
</P>

Some 42 percent of the respondents reported they feel "safe" or
"very safe", up slightly from 38 percent in February 1998.

Racial discrimination scandals have constantly been exposed in
the United States in recent years. In 1997, The American news
media revealed that the U.S. Department of Health authorized the
Tuskegee Medical Research Center to use free medical treatment and
food as enticements to recruit 600 black patients from Alabama for
secret projects carried out in 1932-1972 to study the effects of
syphilis on the human body.
</P>
<P>
Patients participating in the experiments over the 40-year
period were never told the truth and never received appropriate
medical treatment. The U.S. government eventually terminated the
projects amidst a major scandal which surfaced in 1972. By that
time, however, at least 28 people had died from syphilis, and more
than 100 patients suffered from complications related to the
disease. In addition, the wives of more than 40 patients and 19 of
their infant children were infected with syphilis.
</P>
<P>
In spite of repeated class action filed against the U.S.
government, the surviving victims were forced to wait until 1997,
some 65 years after the beginning of the experiments, to receive a
government apology. The U.S. government, in fact, admitted that
the experiments were a shameful incident of "racial discrimination
".
</P>
<P>
Another historical scandal surfaced in the U.S. in March of
1998 when the State of Mississippi made public some 124,000 pages
of secret documents from the archives of the state's former
Sovereignty Committee. The documents revealed that the Committee,
which operated from 1956-1977, spent some 250,000 U.S. dollars
annually to maintain a racial segregation system and had resorted
to intimidation, illegal imprisonment, bribing juries and various
other illegal means to thwart the efforts of civil rights
activists. The Committee, which counterparts in other states
viewed as a prototype for safeguarding the racial discrimination
system at any cost, was disbanded in 1977 and the State decided to
seal the archives for 50 years. The general public finally won
access to the archives following a 21-year marathon lawsuit (20).

Black people in the United States do not as yet enjoy equal
rights in terms of participating in government affairs. A study
report released in January 1997 by a Washington-based criminal
verdict research center showed that 1.46 black men out of the
total 10.4 million eligible black voters had been deprived of
their right to vote after being convicted of felonies. This means
that one of every seven eligible black voters loses the right to
vote after receiving severe court penalties (21).
</P>
<P>
Statistics for 1998 provided by the Human Rights Watch
indicated that U.S. adults stripped of the right to vote account
for some two percent of the country's total, and nevertheless, the
number of blacks deprived of the right to vote accounted for 13
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
One-third of the blacks in Alabama and Florida were deprived of
their right to vote in the 1996 elections. Human Rights Watch
predicts that some 30 to 40 percent of the next generation of
black people in the U.S. will permanently lose their right to vote
if the current situation remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The Voting Rights Act enacted in 1965 authorized the Department
of Justice to monitor elections in various southern states and
required certain states to designate as many as possible
constituencies where black voters account for a majority.
Nonetheless, the actual situation proves the contrary. Some states
have resorted to redistricting the constituencies to restrict the
black people's participation in government affairs.
</P>
<P>
For example, the local government in Jackson city of
Mississippi, responded to the threat that blacks would soon become
the city's majority population by redistricting constituencies to
divide and diminish their power by moving them to districts with a
majority of white people. The city has resorted to similar action
on several occasions since 1960.

Black people account for 27 percent of total eligible voters in
the State of Georgia. In 1997, however, the redistricting of 11
constituencies left black voters with the majority in only one
constituency. The Supreme Court issued a June 19 ruling that the
state acted in compliance with the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Not a single black person has been elected to the school board
in Bossier Parish, Louisiana, in spite of the fact that blacks
account for 20 percent of the local population. In 1997, the local
branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People (NAACP) suggested redistricting in order to establish two
constituencies with black majorities. The local government's
rejection of the suggestion won the backing of the Supreme Court
which on May 12 issued a favorable verdict by a 7:2 vote (22).
</P>
<P>
Racial discrimination has had an impact on every aspect of
social life in the United States. Results of the most recent
census show a disparity in the economic status of blacks, with the
average net property value of black families standing a only a
tenth of the level for white families. An USA Today article
published in April 1997 noted that the income level for Afro-
American families stands at only 63 percent of the level for white
families.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, an article in the September 3, 1997, issue of the
Wall Street Journal said the income level for a black person is 19
percent lower than that for a white person with the same education
level. It also noted that the proportion of poverty-stricken black
families is 15 percentage points higher than for poor white
families, with the total number of the former more doubling the
figure for the latter.

While blacks account for 10.1 percent of the total U.S. work
force very few of them have access to fields such as medicine, law,
journalism and engineering. Even when assuming equal conditions, a
black person has only a 33 percent chance of getting a job
compared to his or her white counterpart (23).
</P>
<P>
Apart from rendering unfair rulings in cases involving equal
rights for different races, the U.S. Supreme Court also neglected
racial representation when hiring employees. According to a USA
Today report in March 1998, the nine Supreme Court justices employ
394 clerks, with Hispanics accounting for one percent, black some
two percent and Asian-Americans 4.5 percent of the total. Not a
single native American Indian has been employed.
</P>
<P>
Statistics for 1998 revealed that in the U.S. states, where the
death penalty is in force, among a total of 1,838 prosecutors
having the right to recommend the death sentences, whites
accounted for the bulk of prosecutors, with only 22 blacks and 22
Hispanics included in the total.
</P>
<P>
Blacks account for 12 percent of the total American population.
However, blacks account for 54.2 percent of prison inmates and
more than 40 percent of convicted criminals subject to capital
punishment. A black person faces a nine times greater chance of
receiving a death sentence than a white person convicted for the
same crime. While blacks and whites have accounted for almost the
same proportion of murder victims in the United States since 1997,
some 82 percent of people executed were convicted of murdering
white persons (24).
</P>
<P>
The January 30, 1997, issue of the Washington Post reported the
number of blacks sentenced into prison in 1998 was 6.88 times the
number for whites. However, the figure has since surged to 7.66
times.
</P>
<P>
A news dispatch released by the Agency France Presse (AFP) on
August 26, 1997, said that one of every three blacks in the U.S.
was either a criminal suspect or otherwise wanted by the police.
In the first four months of 1997, some 24,000 young black
Washington residents between the ages of 18 and 25 were either
serving jail terms or were wanted by local authorities, accounting
for 49.8 percent of the total residents of the same age group,

reporting on it has given readers a false impression that Kenya is
full of domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
Since Kenya is an open society, he said, a relatively large
number of reports on crimes are allowed, as long as they help the
society to realize the damage of violence and bribery and raise
public awareness.
</P>
<P>
Last week, at a workshop at the United States International
University of Africa in Nairobi, Akenga told journalists that
despite many obstacles that journalists were confronted in the
field, they were still expected to report fairly.

The education conditions of ethnic groups in the United States
are in a state of crisis. According to the American Council on
Education on May 19, 1997, the annual growth rate of university
enrollment among ethnic groups in 1995 was 2.9 percent, compared
to 7.1 in 1993 and 4.6 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Among African Americans in 1995 the rate was only 1.7 percent
more than in 1994. University enrollment among Caucasian high
school graduates has gone from 32 percent in 1975 to 43 percent in
1995 while there has been almost no increase among ethnic groups.
In 1995, university enrollment among black Americans aged 18 to 24
was just above 35 percent, three percent more than in 1975; and
the rate among Hispanic American high school graduates was also 35
percent, the same as in 1975 (25).
</P>
<P>
According to a report in the February 3, 1998 edition of USA
Today, a fifth of Hispanic Americans aged 16 to 24 dropped out of
high school. If those of the same age group who did not go to
school are counted, altogether 30 percent of the young Hispanic
Americans do not get high school education. In the past 25 years,
the drop-out rate among Hispanic Americans has ranged from 30 to
35 percent, or three times the average in the United States and 3.
5 times that of Caucasians. Meanwhile, the rate among non-Hispanic
Americans of school age has decreased steadily.
</P>
<P>
According to the American Council on Education's 1995 report,
fewer than 60 percent of Hispanic Americans aged 18 to 24 had
finished high school education or had an equivalent education; the
rate among black Americans was only 77 percent, but among
Caucasians it was 82 percent.

In 1996, the state of California passed Proposition 209 and a
court in Texas upheld a similar law that did away with the decades
old preferential treatment for members of ethnic groups in
enrolling in graduate schools. This led to a sharp decline in the
number of students from ethnic groups at the country's two biggest
and most famous public universities in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the autumn of 1997, enrollments of black Americans and
Hispanic Americans in the University of California and the
University of Texas' law school were down 80 percent from the
previous year, resulting in the smallest number of enrollments
since 1970.
</P>
<P>
There is also an obvious racial barrier in the United States in
health care, where the death rate among black American infants is
more than twice that among Caucasians. The incidence of heart
disease among black Americans is about three times that among
Caucasians, and rate of deaths from cancer among black Americans
and Hispanic Americans is higher than that among Caucasians.
Conditions are similar among American Indians and some Asian-
Americans. Life expectancy of black American men and women is 5.4
years and 7.5 years less than that of Caucasians respectively.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, racial discrimination has grown in the United
States along with incidents of racial violence. According to a
report of the Southern Poverty Law Center on March 3, 1998, the
number of organizations promoting racial discrimination increased
20 percent in 1997 from the previous year and there are now 474
such organizations in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to a report on June 8, 1997 of the National Church
Arson Task Force, from January 1995 to May 1997, there were 162
black American churches burned down, with the majority of acts of
arson committed by Caucasians.

There were 160 out of 199 suspected arsonists questioned in 150
arson cases who were Caucasians. According to a 1997 report from
the National Asian-Pacific American Consortium, in 1996 there were
534 acts of violence committed against Asian-Americans, an
increase of 17 percent over 1995, and 90 percent of those that
were criminal cases were racially motivated.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is a nation of immigrants, but in recent years, moves
to restrict immigration have been on the rise. The Welfare Reform
Law, which was approved by the U.S. Congress and the Immigration
Law enacted on April 1, 1997, reduced and did away subsidies for
immigrants and had many clauses discriminating against illegal
immigrants and causing many difficulties for immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The United States began repatriating illegal immigrants in
large numbers, in many cases infringing on the rights of
immigrants. According to the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
in 1996, Mexican consulates in the United States received more
than 80,000 appeals for help from Mexican immigrants. In September
1997, a group of 56 Guatemalan immigrants were shackled and
handcuffed by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service for
return to Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
A report on teenagers said that thousands of Mexicans enter the
United States every year as illegal immigrants, and a considerable
number of them are teenagers. From 1993 to 1996, some 62,000
Mexican children were taken by the U.S. authorities to the border
between Mexico and the United States with no protection of basic
rights.

In October 1998, Amnesty International issued a 150-page human
rights report on the U.S.. It cited a host of facts revealing that
the U.S. has a "persistent and widespread pattern of human rights
violations," while considering itself in the position of being in
the "international leadership in the field of human rights."
</P>
<P>
Directed against the U.S., Amnesty International launched a
campaign saying that human rights are not just the affairs of
foreign countries, and urged the U.S. to "mind its own business."

</P>
<P>
The United States is a country where violent crimes are most
serious in the world. On average, 65 people die and more than 6,
000 people become disabled by violent crimes every day. (3)
</P>
<P>
According to information released in November 1997 by the
Bureau of Justice Statistics of the U.S. Department of Justice, in
1996, 12.4 cases of violent crimes were reported among every 1,000
people at and above the age of 12. (4)
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that between 1991 and June 1996, 9,859
people in New York City fell victims to murder attempts.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, one out of every 10 people in the U.S.
working in the catering trade was murdered every week.
</P>
<P>
The juvenile crime rate has risen 600 percent since the 1960s,
and murder cases involving juveniles under 17 years old tripled
between 1984 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey on juvenile violent criminal cases in the
26 most developed countries, released in February 1997 by the U.S.
Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the juvenile crime rate
in the U.S. is much higher than in the other developed countries.

The U.S. also witnesses several thousand cases of criminal
explosions every year. Between 1991 and 1995, 14,200 such cases of
explosions were reported, claiming the lives of 456 people,
injuring 3,839, and resulting in property losses of 1.l61 billion
U.S. dollars. (5)
</P>
<P>
The United States has more firearms in the hands of individuals
than any other country in the world. A report released by the U.S.
Department of Justice on May 5,1997 indicates that the country has
nearly 200 million private firearms, and two thirds of all U.S.
households have guns.
</P>
<P>
Though it is legal to bear arms in the United States, private
firearms now seriously endanger the lives and personal safety of
Americans.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that the U.S. has on average one million
criminal shooting incidents and more than 20,000 shooting deaths a
year, with a similar number of people committing suicide with guns.
</P>
<P>
An international survey released by the U.S. Administration
departments in April 1998 indicates that the death toll from
shootings in murders, suicides and accidents in the U.S. ranks
number one among the world's 36 richest countries. (6)
</P>
<P>
Between 1985 and 1995, the U.S. juvenile crime rate tripled and
the number of murders involving guns quadrupled.

With the widespread use of private firearms, gun-related
incidents are now endangering security in the schools.
</P>
<P>
On March 24, 1998, two middle-school students in the state of
Arkansas, one 11 and the other 13, took 10 rifles and pistols and
killed four girl students and a female teacher and wounded another
11 students and teachers within 30 seconds in a schoolyard.
</P>
<P>
On May 21, a high school student aged at 15 in the state of
Oregon shot his parents to death before rushing to his school and
madly shooting at more than 400 fellow students, killing two and
wounding 19 others.
</P>
<P>
Since the second half of 1997, U.S. school campuses have
experienced over a dozen such incidents, shocking people all over
the country.
</P>
<P>
Though the U.S. administration claims that the number of
violent crimes has been reduced in recent years, an investigation
indicates that 61 percent of Americans believe that the crime
problem has become more and more serious, and 68 percent expected
a higher crime rate in the year of 2000, according to an article
in Time magazine's January 20, 1997 issue.
</P>
<P>
A recent poll conducted jointly by the Washington Post and the
American Broadcasting Corporation shows that many of those
surveyed expressed concern over crime and did not believe the
latest government figures claiming that crime rates have declined.

The United States calls itself the "Free World". The proportion
of prisoners in the United States, however, tops the world.
</P>
<P>
A report issued by the U.S. Department of Justice on August 17,
1997, says that the number of people who committed crimes and
received sentences in the United States in 1996 hit a record 5.5
million.
</P>
<P>
According to a report issued by the Bureau of Justice
Statistics on January 22, 1998, the number of people serving
prison terms in the United States increased to more than 1.7
million by June 30, 1997 from 740,000 in 1985. This figure more
than doubled in 12 years, with an average annual increase of 8.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
The German magazine Der Spiegel pointed out in an article on
December 14, 1998 that the number of prisoners in the United
States had reached 1.8 million people, the highest number in
history.
</P>
<P>
Jail is also used to confine those suffering mental disorders,
and some 200,000 mental patients are now imprisoned in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
To meet the demand of the increasing number of prisoners, the
country has had to build many more jails.
</P>
<P>
According to a 1997 report issued by the U.S. Department of
Justice, the United States built 220 new jails between 1990 and
1996 to accommodate a 43 percent increase in the prisoner
population.
</P>
<P>
The number of beds in the jails in 18 states increased
dramatically to 74,000 at present from 2,620 in 1986.
</P>
<P>
In spite of this, the increased number of jails lags far behind
that of the prisoners.

Many juveniles are placed in the same jails as adult prisoners,
but children seeking protection are sometimes put in jails
different from their parents. By the end of June 1998, some 3,500
juvenile offenders were jailed together with adult prisoners.

Violence is very prevalent in U.S. jails. Prisoners are
maltreated not only by fellow prisoners, but also by prison guards.

The United States ranks first in the use of high technology for

capsicum spray (7), which has killed more than 60 people since

conducted extremely harsh control measures against prisoners, who
were denied almost all personal contacts with others and were put

<P>
The Ellis No.1 Jail in Texas is a place for those who are

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
has said the government will not accept acts of terrorism to
destabilize the country.
</P>
<P>
The president urged Zambians to be alert following bomb blasts
which rocked Lusaka Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba made the appeal Sunday at the Lusaka International
Airport on arrival from a two-day visit to Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Monday's Zambian newspaper, Times of Zambia, quoted Chiluba as
describing the explosions as acts of terrorism, saying the
government would ensure the perpetrators were brought to book.
</P>
<P>
The government would study the situation before making a
decision, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba noted that the sad development would not derail the
peace initiatives to find a lasting solution to the conflicts in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The bomb blasts in Lusaka will not derail Zambia's role in the
peace process in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), he said,
adding the process would continue and that all the countries he
visited were showing keenness and preparedness to resolve the
conflict in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Though the fighting hasn't stopped, we have to find a common
ground, otherwise the situation will worsen," he said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that he had to visit three more countries,
Namibia, Botswana and finally the DRC again, before he could wind
up consultative talks toward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The president left for Kampala, capital of Uganda, on Saturday
for a one- day meeting with President Yoweri Museveni and flew to
Rwanda Sunday to meet President Pasteur Bizimungu for
consultations over the conflict in the DRC.

Both countries are backing rebel forces fighting the government

<P>
The Jerusalem Post
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's warplanes heavily bombed guerrilla targets in
southern and eastern Lebanon on Sunday. The air raids came after
four Israelis, including a brigadier general, were killed earlier
by a roadside bomb set by the Islamic militant Hezbollah group in
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz
</P>
<P>
-- Nabil Shaath, the planning minister of the Palestinian
National Authority, Sunday criticized Israel's decision to impose
a full closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He called the

<HEADLINE> Foreigner Likely to Head Kenya's Anti-graft Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is
considering the possibility to appoint a foreigner to lead the
country's anti-graft body, The East African weekly newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The recruitment of a expatriate as director of the
government-funded Kenya Anti-Corruption Authority (KACA) was the
focus of meetings held last week between senior government
officials and a mission from the International Monetary Fund led
by a deputy managing director, Shigemitsu Sugisaki.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the government of Daniel arap Moi formally
requested the Bretton Woods Institution to help it pick a
non-Kenyan to head the controversial organization, which was
established by an Act of Parliament to investigate and prosecute
corruption cases.
</P>
<P>
By proposing to fill the post with an outsider, analysts say,
the Kenyan government hopes to convince donors of its
determination to allow the organization to operate without
interference.
</P>
<P>
The first director of the anti-corruption authority, John Mwau,
resigned in November last year, three months after a tribunal
completed an inquiry into his competence and ability to hold
office.

ADDIS ABABA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The current chairman and the
secretary general of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) said
Monday that they "welcome the acceptance by the government of
Eritrea of the OAU Framework Agreement".

<P>
"We recall that the government of Ethiopia has already accepted
the Framework Agreement," the statement said, adding "Therefore,
given the acceptance by both parties of the Framework Agreement,
we urge for an immediate end to the fighting so that the
modalities for a peaceful resolution of this unfortunate dispute
in accordance with the Framework Agreement can be pursued."

<P>
The OAU pledged to leave no stone unturned in the pursuit of
its objective of bringing about a lasting peace between the two
countries.

II. Dollar Democracy
</P>
<P>
The U.S. boasts of being the world's model of democracy in
spite of low voter turn-out for elections. According to a report
in the August 26, 1997 issue of Singapore's Unite Morning News, a
leading daily of the country, an increasing number of voters are
losing their enthusiasm for participating in elections to fulfill
their basic political obligation as U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 voter turn-out in the U.S. was only 48 percent, with
the figure dropping below 50 percent for the first time since 1924.
When considering both the presidential and mid-term elections, the
participation of eligible voters in the U.S. was the lowest among
all the developed countries.
</P>
<P>
This continuing decline in turn-out, the longest and worst in
the history of the United States, has influenced people of all
classes, ages, income levels and races. The turn-out of voters
between 18-24 years of age dropped from 42 percent in 1972 to less
than 30 percent in the last presidential election, and only 16
percent in the 1994 election.
</P>
<P>
The turn-out for voters with annual incomes of less than 15,000
U.S. dollars dropped 20 percent between 1990 and 1994, with the
participation for mid-term elections falling to less than 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
The disparity between black and white U.S. voters was five
percent in 1984, and the figure rose even further to more than 10
percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Controlling state power has always been the privilege of a
small number of wealthy U.S. citizens. Based on the annual
personal asset reports of members of the current Clinton cabinet,
approximately half of the cabinet members have personal assets of
over one million U.S. dollars, with some reporting family assets
of over 80 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to a 1997 report in USA Today, the average personal
assets of 25 judicial candidates suggested by U.S. President Bill
Clinton was 1.8 million U.S. dollars, with the list including 15
millionaires.
</P>
<P>
Statistics compiled by a Washington-based organization show
that 34.1 percent of judges in the United States are millionaires
(10).
</P>
<P>
Even in the Congress, the proportion of millionaires to the
total number of legislators is dozens of times higher than the
level for U.S. society as a whole.

<HEADLINE> 4 Killed in Bombs Explosions in Ambon, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Four were killed, seven others
injured and 15 houses burned down in a fresh riot prompted by
hand-made bombs explosions in Rinjani village in Ambon, capital of
Indonesia's Maluku province, Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
The riot began at 6:00 a.m. local time despite a peace
agreement signed by village heads and elders in Ambon Sunday
afternoon, according to Antara News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The peace agreement signed on Sunday was the second of its kind
after the February 23 riots foiled the first one.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted witnesses as saying that they saw a group of
people crossing a river throwing the bombs into the village,
prompting villagers in Rinjani to set fire on 15 houses of the
attackers.
</P>
<P>
A fire engine escorted by some Armed Forces officers arrived at
the site, but little could be done as the location could not be
reached by two-wheeled or four-wheeled vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Ambon and several other islands in Maluku province have been
the scene of violent clashes between Muslim and Christian groups
since mid-January, which have left at least 127 people dead and
caused massive damage.
</P>
<P>
Most of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim. Maluku is a
pre-dominantly Christian province.

The United States always glorifies its freedom of press.
However, freedom of press in the U.S. is nothing more than a myth.
A research report compiled by the Sociology Department at Sonoma
State University, California, showed that the U.S. press is
controlled by boards of directors for major multinational
companies which are either owners or shareholders of the country's
most powerful TV stations and newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The 11 most powerful print and electronic media giants in the U.
S. all have connections with 144 of the 1,000 largest enterprises.
In addition, each major enterprise maintains close relations with
heads of at least two of most powerful media giants. Eighty-one
managers of the six largest members of the electronic media hold
important positions with 104 major enterprises, with 76 general
managers of the five largest print media giants which publish 160
dailies maintaining close connections with 66 of the 1,000 largest
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
U.S. enterprises and press media giants are controlled by
wealthy individuals. Journalists often maintain their jobs,
salaries and promotion opportunities by catering to the values and
viewpoints their general managers and the wealthy hold concerning
international political and economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
In their most recent research report, researchers from Sonoma
State University point out that the U.S. government wants American
citizens to believe that members of the press media are "
independent organizations". However, according to report, they are
in fact "hostages" of the values and economic benefits of their
owners and sponsors (11).
</P>
<P>
Another survey conducted by the American Society of Newspaper
Editors in 1998 revealed that most Americans harbor suspicions
concerning the so-called free press system. Seventy-eight percent
of the public pointed to the overly biased viewpoints of the press,
while 80 percent indicated that newspapers dramatize some news
items for commercial purposes, with over 75 percent citing
suspicions that some news lacks credible sources (12).

III. Troubled With Poverty
</P>
<P>
The U.S., the world's wealthiest country, has recorded steady
economic growth for eight years running. Nonetheless, the country
is still troubled by poverty, hunger and homelessness due to the
serious polarization of wealth distribution.
</P>
<P>
The gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen as the
bulk of the country's wealth flows into the wallets of the rich.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post carried an article on March 1, 1998, saying
that the richest one percent of the U.S. population possesses more
wealth than the total wealth of 90 percent of the total population.
</P>
<P>
The bottom 25 percent of U.S. families witnessed a nine percent
decline in income between 1979 and 1995, with the richest 25
percent of families enjoying a 26 percent increase during the
period, according to a U.S.A. Today report in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The income for the richest five percent of families was 5.7
times that for bottom 20 percent of families in 1995.
</P>
<P>
A report released by the U.S. Census Bureau in October 1997
noted that the richest American families had enjoyed a 46 percent
increase in income since 1967, with the level for the poorest
rising by only 14 percent. (13)
</P>
<P>
Official statistics released in 1997 show that the top 20
percent of U.S. families shared 49 percent of the country's total
income in 1996, with the income level for the bottom 20 percent
families falling by 1.8 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Institute of
Volcanology and Seismology (Philvocs) expanded Monday the
monitoring equipment at the main crater of the Taal Volcano in
Batangas, the northern Philippines, as the volcano might erupt at
any time.
</P>
<P>
Philvocs specialists said that the gauges would measure the
temperature at the lake level of the main crater, where the
concentration of the hydrothermal activity has been monitored.
</P>
<P>
Visual observation conducted by the Philvocs Sunday at the
Daang Kastila look-out point disclosed another mud-sputtering
activity at the 1999 reactivated vent.
</P>
<P>
The activity started at 09:00 local time and lasted for about
an hour with mud spewing from two to three meters in height. Steam
emission rose to as high as 40-5 meters above the vent, the
Philvocs said.
</P>
<P>
The Philvocs reiterates its caution to the local residents and
visitors not to venture inside the main crater and long Daan
Kastila trail as sudden steam bust or "phreatic" explosions might
occur at any time.

<P>
DHAKA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The second summit of the
Developing Eight (D-8) group will be held here on March 1-2 to
find ways to expand trade and economic cooperation among its eight
member countries.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
According to the Istanbul Declaration, the main objective of
the D-8 is socio-economic development, in accordance with the
following guidelines - peace instead of confrontation, dialogue
instead of confrontation, cooperation instead of confrontation,
justice instead of double standards, equality instead of
discrimination, and democracy instead of oppression.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen areas of cooperation have been identified for the
group: trade, industry, communication and information, finance,
banking and privatization, rural development, science and
technology, poverty alleviation and human resources development,
agriculture, energy, environment, health, tourism, culture and
sports.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of a division of work, each member country is
assigned with the coordination work of one or more sectors.

and micro-credit, Egypt on trade and industry, Indonesia on
poverty alleviation and human resources development, Iran on
science and technology, Malaysia on finance, banking and

organ formed by heads of state or government and held on an annual
basis; the Council of Ministers comprising foreign ministers of
member countries and acting as a forum for thorough and
comprehensive consideration of issues; and the Commission, the
executive organ of the group consisting of senior officials
appointed by their respective governments.

<HEADLINE> Human Rights Records in United States (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A signed article by Ren Yanshi
entitled "Human Rights Records in the United States" was published
here today. Following is the full text of the article.
</P>
<P>
On February 26 the United States issued its "1998 Human Rights
Report." Posing as a "human rights judge" once again, it attacked
the human rights records of more than 190 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Ignoring the actual situation, the report blamed China for
committing "widespread and well documented human rights abuses,"
but did not say a single word about the human rights problems in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the U.S., which often grades human rights records of
other countries, won low marks from its own people and the
international community.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. human rights organization called "Peter D. Hart Research
Associates" indicated in its survey released on December 10, 1997
that 63 percent of those surveyed believe that poor people in the
U.S. are usually discriminated against.
</P>
<P>
The report added that over half of the surveyed in the U.S.
believe that the disabled, the elderly, and the native Americans
are routinely discriminated against; 41 percent believe that black
Americans are often discriminated against, while 70 percent of the
blacks themselves believe that they felt discriminated against.
</P>
<P>
A director of the organization Human Rights U.S.A. said at a
press conference that "the survey shows we have human rights
problems right here in the United States." (1)

<HEADLINE> African Leaders to Discuss Congo (K) Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Five African leaders are expected
to discuss the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
in Kinshasa Monday, a spokesman of Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe said Sunday in Harare.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Mugabe left for the DRC on Sunday for the
talks. He was scheduled to meet President Sam Nujoma of Namibia,
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos of Angola and President Idris
Deby of Chad monday.
</P>
<P>
All four presidents have committed troops to the DRC to aid the
DRC government against rebels.
</P>
<P>
"They will be meeting tomorrow (Monday) and although it has
been penciled in as a one-day trip, events there might warrant the
extension of the stay," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The four leaders also will meet DRC president Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The DRC has been engulfed in a seven-month war which has seen
the involvement of up to six countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Ugandan and Rwandan support the rebels in
the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Attempts by the regional leaders to broker a peace deal have
yielded little success although there now seems a common desire
among the warring parties to come to a ceasefire agreement.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Mugabe met United States Under Secretary of State
for Political Affairs Thomas Pickering in Harare. The two had
almost two hours of discussions, with the DRC crisis taking center
stage, the daily Herald reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I came to discuss a number of subjects but the Congo figures
heavily on that list and we wanted to hear President Mugabe's
views on the peace efforts because we all feel very strongly that
there is need to establish peace in the DRC," said Pickering.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 1 (Xinhua) - A senior Tanzanian religious
leader has strongly condemned the United States and Britain for
their endless air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Dar es Salaam Archbishop, Cardinal Pengo, told a special mass
ceremony Saturday at a newly built university in northwestern city
of Mwanza that the attacks were violation of human rights, local
English newspaper The Guardian reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"There is no basic reason supporting the US and Britain to
strike iraq. It's absolutely misuse of power," he said. "US and
Britain are the world's leading human rights violators."
</P>
<P>
At the inauguration of St Augustine University of Tanzania,
Cardinal Pengo cautioned the two nations against abusing science
and technology to bully weak nations.
</P>
<P>
"Science and technology does not mean that you are the top of
the top. You should respect others as well as your God," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the UN for failing to observe peace among
its members, saying that the world body has been swallowed by the
powerful nations.

<HEADLINE> Marine Waste Collection Centers Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A master plan is brewing to set
up collection centers in the Gulf region to receive waste from
marine transport vessels, a major official for the regional
affairs said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Al Awadi, executive secretary of the Regional Organization
for the Protection of the Marine Environment (ROPME), who is here
on a visit, told reporters that the plan is aimed at curbing
damages to the marine environment and natural resources in the
region and is expected to cost between 300 million to 400 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Al Awadi, who is here on a visit, also said joint efforts
must be made by the Gulf countries to protect the regional waters
from being polluted by ships dumping waste.
</P>
<P>
The official pointed out that about 20,000 ships cruised the
Gulf every year, making the region a "huge oil pipe."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that waste collection centers have to be set up
in different parts of the region to receive solid and liquid
waste from international marine transport vessels cruising the
Gulf waters.
</P>
<P>
He said a feasibility study to set up the centers is being
conducted by the Gulf Cooperation Council, in cooperation with
the European Union. The study will be completed within two
months.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Dr. Awadi said in a speech at a ceremony that
continuous action is needed to monitor air and marine
environment, adding the "efforts being made in this regard are
enormous, but compared to incidents taking place they equal a
drop in a huge sea."
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was held to mark the celebrations of the UAE's
Second National Environment Day, which fell on February 4 under
the theme "Together to Conserve Our Marine Environment".

<P>
HARARE, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Up to 25,000 home-seekers in 24
urban councils will benefit from a 760-million-Zimbabwean Dollar
(20 million U.S. Dollars) loan scheme for servicing stands and
developing low-cost housing infrastructure under the Zimbabwean
government's National Housing Fund, the daily Herald reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
More than 6,000 mortgages are expected to be processed before

access the money from the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has an urban housing backlog of more than 670,000
units, which is projected to reach 1.1 million by the turn of the
century.

<P>
The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has given
half the amount while the building societies will contribute the
rest.

<P>
A USAID spokesman in Harare told the Herald Sunday the housing
guarantee loan was disbursed to Treasury in mid-Febuary following
satisfactory progress in the Zimbabwean government's private
sector housing program since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The USAID has so far provided more than 2.5 billion Zimbabwean
Dollars (65.7 million U.S. Dollars) through the Ministry of

<HEADLINE> Australia to Partner U.S. in Surveillance Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Australian defense forces would
cooperate with the United States in the development of the
revolutionary unmanned surveillance aircraft Global Hawk,
Australian Defense Minister John Moore said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Moore said each country would provide 9 million U.S. dollars to
the 18-million-dollar project to develop the jet, which is
expected to take about two years.
</P>
<P>
The Global Hawk is capable of flying pre-programmed missions
for up to 38 hours at an altitude of 20 km and can survey an area
of 137,000 square km on each mission.
</P>
<P>
Australian Defense Science and Technology Organization (DSTO)
Surveillance Systems Division Chief Don Sinnott said surveillance
information could be relayed from the jet to a computerized ground
station.
</P>
<P>
Sinnott said the information could then be processed to locate
targets and give the commander of a mission the ability to make
decisions without endangering human life.
</P>
<P>
He said Global Hawk was developed in the U.S. with the
intention of using it for land surveillance but the Australian
Defense Force planned to develop it as a means of surveying the
coastline.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to use it in maritime areas, they are different
problems. We are an island nation so maritime is a big deal for
us, we have a huge coastline," Sinnott said.
</P>
<P>
Sinnott said it could be used to help Australia defend itself
from attack but could also be used for other operations such as
stopping illegal immigration, illegal fishing or drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Information from the Global Hawk could also be beamed anywhere
in the world via satellite and the mission of the jet could be
changed through a land-based remote control site if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Moore said in a statement that such an advanced system would be
particularly useful in Australia to monitor such a huge land mass
and coastline.

LHASA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Larry King, a 49-year old Canadian,
came to China's Tibet Autonomous Region in the summer of 1992 and
has lived here for over five years, teaching English, studying
Chinese and Tibetan languages, and visiting tourist spots.
</P>
<P>
Tibet's unique religion, culture and geographic conditions,
interest him a great deal.
</P>
<P>
He says that he has been deeply moved by the beautiful frescoes,
folk songs, and dances and the experience has made him realize
that people of the world share the same humanity, no matter how
different they are from each other in social aspects.
</P>
<P>
Other foreigners have changed their attitude about Tibet after
visiting the region. One American businessman who came to Tibet
for the second time during the Spring Festival, which fell on
February 16, said he was surprised to see the great changes that
have taken place in just a few years.
</P>
<P>
The roads are wider, communication is more convenient, and the
city is even more beautiful. Since the first visit in the summer
of 1997, he said, he has been attracted by the special customs and
architecture. The investment environment was another reason for
coming a second time. The American architectural design company he
works for plans to invest two million dollars in promoting Tibetan-
styled architecture in America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Many Americans know little about Chinese culture, to say
nothing about Tibetan culture, he says, and they need to be more
open-minded to accept whatever is good for human beings, whether
Western or Eastern.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Import Lead-free Petrol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
decided to import lead-free petroleum form July 1 this year as
part its efforts to minimize air pollution, press reports here
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken at the sixth meeting of the National
Environment held on Sunday, which also decided to impose high
duties on imported two-stroke engines used in auto-rickshaws and
to ensure mandatory use of "catalytic converter" for buses, trucks
and other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The converter is a filter-like equipment to free fuels from
lead, which has been identified as the main culprit for Dhaka's
increasingly polluted air.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also discussed measures against black smoke, noise
pollution, introduction of more double-decker buses and
constitution of environment courts, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Air pollution in Dhaka, capital of Bangladesh, has reached a
very high level due to emission of suspended particulate materials
(SPM) by vehicles at an increasing rate, causing serious health
hazards to some nine million city dwellers, according to a survey
conducted recently by the Department of Environment.
</P>
<P>
The level of SPM has reached 2,600 micrograms per cubic meter,
much higher than the acceptable level of 200 micrograms per cubic
meter, and the range of sulphur di-oxide is about 100 micrograms
per cubic meter against the acceptable level of 80 micrograms, the
survey said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Export Performance in First Two Months Is Not Ideal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The performance of Vietnam's export
in the first two months of this year is not so ideal.
</P>
<P>
Export turnover reached 1.46 billion U.S. dollars, a
year-on-year increase of 0.4 percent, Vietnam News Agency (VAN)
Sunday quoted Vietnam's General Department of Statistics as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Main export items were crude oil with 2.35 million tones, up by
36.6 percent; coffee, 89,000 tones, up by 18.7 percent; sea
products, 100 million U.S. dollars, up by 13 percent; and garment
and textiles, 178 million U.S. dollars, up by 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Decreases were seen in exports of tea, down by 64 percent;
rice, 30 percent; and assembled computers and accessories, 3.5
percent. Exports by foreign-invested businesses were valued at 290
million U.S. dollars, falling 8.5 percent year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's import turnover was nearly 1.5 billion U.S. dollars
in the first two months, 15.4 percent lower than the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
The reduction was recorded in the imports of automobiles, down
by 41.8 percent, and steel, nearly 30 percent, due to increased
home production.
</P>
<P>
Imports of machinery, equipment and spare parts accounted for
255 million U.S. dollars, a year-on-year decrease of 12.7 percent.
Foreign-invested businesses spent 353 million U.S. dollars on
imports, down by 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
Trade deficit in the past two months was 39 million U.S.
dollars, accounting for 12.3 percent of that in the first two
months of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Four Billion Baht Earned at Bangkok Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The 13th Asian Games held here
last December has generated 3.9 billion baht (108.3 million U.S.
dollars) in income, a senior official from the Bangkok Asian Games
Organizing Committee (BAGOC) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Santiparb Tejavanija, president of BAGOC's Finance and
Privilege Committee, confirmed that the 13th Asiad had made some 3.
9 billion baht, among them 2.8 billion baht (77.8 million dollars)
in cash and one billion baht (27.8 million dollars) in the form of
products and services.
</P>
<P>
BAGOC expects to receive another 560 million baht (15.6 million
dollars) from the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) by March, he said.
</P>
<P>
The huge income is mainly from the Games's 11 official partners
who have paid 44.65 million dollars in cash and 23.78 million
dollars as products and services.
</P>
<P>
BAGOC will also receive 9.7 million dollars from its live
telecast deals with overseas countries and 7.9 million dollars

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Worst Is Over, Turnaround Starts? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The worst of the Asian financial
crisis is over, and the regional economy is starting to pick up --
this is the conclusion of many surveys conducted recently by news
and economic organizations, although some economists may disagree.
</P>
<P>
But believe it or not, more and more signs indicate that the
21-month-old crisis has reached a bottom point and is starting to
turn around.
</P>
<P>
And this conclusion is backed by the performance of the
region's relatively stable market in this year. Despite the launch
of the euro and a financial crisis in Brazil at the beginning of
1999, Asia's financial market recovered very soon after several
days' ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the recent fall of the Japanese yen failed to shake
the Asian currencies. In the past week, the Japanese government
reversed itself and let the yen fall to help weather a worst
post-war recession. The yen depreciated from around 110 against
the U.S. dollar to 122, the lowest in the last three months.
</P>
<P>
Although Asian currencies have remained hostage to the Japanese
yen, their fall has been kept in a normal range, and the foreign
currency market in the region has not seen a big tumble as it did
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
While the regional market is becoming immune to outside
influence, Asia has reached one of the most important milestones
on the way to recovery: the current account surplus in some
countries has begun to decline.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that a reduction in the current account surplus
indicates that domestic demand in Asian countries has revived and
that could stimulate production and imports.
</P>
<P>
In South Korea, with the consumption demand rising, imports
rose by 15.4 percent in January. As a result, South Korea expects
to halve its current account surplus to about 20 billion U.S.
dollars this year from 40 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, imports increased 1.6 percent in January,
reflecting the start of economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
Another positive indication of recovery is the increasing
foreign exchange reserves in Asian countries. In the past two
months, Asian countries, especially those severely hit by the
crisis, increased their foreign exchange reserves through the
purchase of dollars from the spot market, issuance of global bonds
and borrowing from international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, the government floated 1.2 billion dollars
worth of global bonds and bought over 40 million dollars from the
foreign exchange market in the new year. Its foreign exchange
reserves soared to 12 billion dollars by the end of February, an
equivalent of four months of imports.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's foreign exchange reserves rose to 52.5 billion
dollars as of January 15, up from 52.04 billion dollars at the end
of last December. In Thailand, foreign exchange reserves also
climbed to 29 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
With their foreign exchange reserves returning to the
pre-crisis levels, Asian countries have enhanced their capability
of settling short-term foreign debts and increasing imports,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
As an engine of economic development in Asia, the region's
exports are also seeing a turnaround. There are signs that the
crushing drops in consumption in crisis-struck Asian countries are
slowing and even reversing.
</P>
<P>
Across the region, businesses have stopped cutting their
purchases, retail sales for some categories of goods appear to
have bottomed out. Stabilizing domestic demand is a crucial step
on Asia's road to recovery, economists said.
</P>
<P>
As the Asian crisis eases, economists have become more and more
optimistic about Asia's recovery. At the end of last year, many
economists predicted that Southeast Asian and South Korean
economies would continue to see negative growth in 1999.
</P>
<P>
But now, many of them believe that except Indonesia, other
crisis-hit countries are expected to register a 1 percent to 3.5
percent growth this year.
</P>
<P>
Economists of the International Monetary Fund and the Asian
Development Bank declared recently that the Asian crisis has
reached the bottom and the worst is over.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Bring Back Stranded Housemaids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has made all
arrangements to bring back 100 of the 300 housemaids stranded in
Kuwait by early March, the Foreign Employment Bureau (FEB) sources
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
All arrangements are being made to bring back the remaining 200
women by the end of April this year, the sources said, adding that
these women are stranded without money, visas and passports.
</P>
<P>
Following recent incidents of Sri Lankan housemaids in the
Middle East being badly abused, the FEB will be more vigilant in
monitoring through the embassies the well-being of the women
workers in the region, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan migrant workers in the Middle East and Far East have
remitted 60 billion rupees (880 million U.S. dollars) in 1998, 60
percent of which was sent in to the country by the housemaids.
</P>
<P>
There are around one million Sri Lankan migrant workers in
these regions. So far over 158,000 persons have registered with
the FEB which grants special protection for them under a contract.

<HEADLINE> Net Portfolio Investments Up in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Net portfolio investments or "hot
money" entering the Philippines increased by 144 percent as of
February 12 this year, compared with the level in the same period
of last year, Central Bank Governor Gabriel C. Singson said over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Singson said that as of February 12, gross inflows amounted to
774.3 million U.S. dollars compared to gross outflows of 469.5
million dollars, resulting in a net inflow of 304.8 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
This marks a 144-percent increase over the net inflow of 124.8
million dollars resulting from gross inflows of 647.9 million
dollars and gross outflows of 523.1 million dollars from January 1
to February 13 last year.
</P>
<P>
According to Singson, portfolio investment inflow is an action
of confidence in the country and in the economy. "This indicates
more money is coming from the outside into the stock market," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Expressing confidence about the prospects of the economy this
year, Singson projected that inflation would continue to slow
down.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that food prices have gone down, monetary
growth is well under control and the banking system is in stable
condition.
</P>
<P>
But some analysts caution about giving too much importance to
portfolio inflows. Portfolio investments entering or leaving an
economy quickly have been cited as a contributing factor in the
current economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say portfolio investments helped overheat Asian
economies prior to the July 1997 currency crisis. In the wake of
the crisis, the short-term nature of portfolio investments has
hampered Asian countries' efforts to tap capital to revive their
moribund economies.

international seminar on enterprise management was told recently.
</P>
<P>
Some of the trainees are now applying what they have learned in

Commission (SETC) and the World Bank, the seminar focused on
enterprise-management training under market economic conditions in
the 21st century. The meeting was attended by training experts
from the United States, Italy, and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Some experts pointed out that the main hindrance to the
development of enterprise-management training in China lies in the
inadequate marketing of such training.
</P>
<P>
The central government plans to set up new mechanism to improve
the marketability of these training programs, SETC officials said.

<HEADLINE> Major Chinese Grain Producer Improves Efficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province, a
major grain producer, has been restructuring its agricultural
economy by enhancing horticulture and animal husbandry over the
past several years.
</P>
<P>
To date, the province has developed one-million hectares of
vegetables, fruit and flowers, one-fourth of its total crop-
growing area. These products are selling well in many foreign
countries including Japan, Canada and Singapore, with total
exports topping a record 100,000 tons last year.
</P>
<P>
Animal husbandry output reached 44 billion yuan last year,
accounting for another one-fourth of the province's agricultural
output.
</P>
<P>
An official with the provincial agricultural department cited
these new developments as part of Jiangsu's efforts to improve the
efficiency of its agriculture.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the province has set the goal of
leading the country in agricultural modernization.
</P>
<P>
During the past three years, Jiangsu has spent more than six
billion yuan on farm machinery, greatly changing the traditional
methods of farming.
</P>
<P>
Increasing numbers of fine strains of crops and advanced
agricultural techniques have been introduced on farmland
throughout the province.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the province's average annual output of rice rose to
587.8 kilograms per mu or 8,817 kilograms per hectare, a record in
China.

<P>
COLOMBO, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has undertaken a social
service project to rehabilitate the Gypsy community in the
country, the official Daily News reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The project was jointly launched by a nongovernmental
organization, Success Sri Lanka's Kandy branch and the Kandy
Humanitarian Organization at Thabuttegama and Kudagama in the
country's North Central Province recently.
</P>
<P>
Success Sri Lanka has already established a health camp for the
benefit of the community and helped children with school books and
other equipment, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The project has been designed to assist the Gypsies to change
their lifestyle and to introduce to them a sustainable development
program in dairy farming as a self-employment venture.
</P>
<P>
Very little is known about the history of the Sri Lankan
Gypsies, who are believed to be immigrants to this country from
ancient India.
</P>
<P>
The Gypsies comprise nearly 300 families, operate under a
supreme authority and lead a nomadic life. They earn their
livelihood by performing cobras and monkeys. The women are engaged
in fortune-telling and they all live below the poverty line.

<HEADLINE> Organ Transplants Successfully Completed in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Japan's first heart, liver and
kidney transplants from a brain-dead donor were successfully
completed early Monday morning since a law on transplants took
effect in October 1997, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
A male company employee in his 40s received a heart transplant
Sunday night at Osaka University Hospital after the organ was
transferred from Kochi Red Cross Hospital in Kochi Prefecture,
western Japan.
</P>
<P>
The operation on the man, who is suffering from hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, started around 7:30 p.m. Sunday and lasted more
than five hours, Kyodo quoted hospital officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
A 43-year-old man from the city of Nagano received a liver from
the same donor that was transplanted at Shinshu University
Hospital in Matsumoto, Nagano Prefecture, central Japan, The
operation ended at 5:16 a.m. Monday after 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
The donor's kidneys were transplanted in two middle-aged
patients early Monday, one was a person at Tohoku University
Hospital in Sendal, Miyagi Prefecture, northeastern Japan. The
other was a woman in her 40s at state-run Nagasaki Central
Hospital in Omura, Nagasaki Prefecture, southwestern Japan. Both
operations were completed shortly after 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the Kochi hospital on Sunday removed the heart,
liver, kidneys and corneas of the donor, who had been officially
confirmed brain-dead.
</P>
<P>
The heart transplant was Japan's second, following the one
performed in 1968 by surgeon Juro Wada at Sapporo Medical Collage.
The 1968 heart transplant failed and led to a murder complaint
against Wada.
</P>
<P>
Since the Wada case. no organ transplants from brain-dead
donors have been performed in Japan until now. The incident made
organ transplants from brain-dead donors taboo in Japan until the
Diet (parliament) passed the 1997 law which permits organ
transplants from brain-dead donors.

<HEADLINE> Owls Visit Northwestern Chinese Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A flock of owls have settled in a
friendly village in China's Shaanxi province for the current
winter.
</P>
<P>
The 40 owls flew to the village of Dongqi of Dali County some
time ago and have stayed there apparently to get over the winter
season. They go out in a flock at about 7:00 every evening and
return early the next morning, one villager says. And, they don't
screech a lot or catch chickens or other domestic fowl.
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason the owls come is the friendly environment
and protection they get from the local people.
</P>
<P>
Back in the winter of 1996, five owls visited the village and
decided to stay until spring the following year. That number then
grew to 15 in 1997, one villager says.

According to the report from the province's center for
assisting drought victims, nearly 150,000 people of 25,000
families have been suffering from water shortage.
</P>
<P>
Damage has been done to rice, corn and soybean plants in over
100,000 rai (16,000 hectares) of farmland, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The drought center has dispatched water trucks and supplies to
affected villages.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's Light Industry Needs Technical Innovation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China's light industry needs to
get deeply involved in technical innovations in order to sharpen
its competitive edge and penetrate more deeply domestic and
overseas markets, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The State Light Industry Bureau (SLIB) and its local branches
will guide enterprises in accelerating technical improvements to
meet changing and sophisticated consumption habits at home and
abroad, the country's English language newspaper added.
</P>
<P>
This year the industry will put emphasis on technical
renovation projects in backbone enterprises which have annual
exports worth three million U.S. dollars or more.
</P>
<P>
These enterprises cover 10 sectors such as food, paper and
household electrical appliances.
</P>
<P>
Chen Shineng, director of the SLIB, indicated that the light
industry can gain a lot from those 10 pivotal sectors.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, their output value accounted for 83 percent of the
total industrial output in 1997, Chen was quoted by the paper as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that industrial enterprises must develop products
which show great market potential and a high added-value.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, traditional sectors such as the food processing
industry or bicycle manufacturing must also pay close attention to
new technologies.
</P>
<P>
In order to carry out the technical improvement successfully,
the SLIB urged industrial enterprises to increase investment in
research and development, establish a number of State-level
technical centers, and strengthen co-operation with universities
and research institutions to make new research results marketable
quickly.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that 22 such research institutions have
been set up and should play an important role in the performance
of enterprises and their industrial progress.
</P>
<P>
Chen also asked that light industrial enterprises absorb
advanced technologies form their overseas counterparts.
</P>
<P>
He said that the sector should pay more attention to advanced
technologies and management from foreign partners who can do more
than just bring in equipment and capital.

<HEADLINE> Paper Says Philippines Ill-Prepared For Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines seems still
ill-prepared to face the millennium bug with 10 months to go
before the year 2000, the Manila Bulletin newspaper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that both public and private sectors have almost
completed the awareness and assessment phases of their Y2K
compliance programs.
</P>
<P>
But of the seven mission-critical sectors, only the
manufacturing industry has passed the half-way mark in the
implementation stage although most private companies have started
Y2K projects three years ago, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It said that manufacturing showed 58 percent completion of the
last stage of the program, and the telecommunications industry is
only half-way the implementation stage, at 50 percent, followed by
finance, at 49 percent; utilities, 39 percent, transportation, 33
percent; health care, 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
Government services lagged at the bottom of the list at 9
percent, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
As the deadline for the year 2000 approaches, it said, the
National Security Council was tasked to implement a contingency
plan, providing fool-proof safety measures to avert any
Y2K-related crisis by next year.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Science and Technology and the National
Disaster Coordinating Council will provide the technical and
administrative support, it said.

<HEADLINE> Economic Crisis Pushes Up HIV/AIDS Cases in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The worsening economic crisis has
prompted many Indonesians to enter the sex industry, sparking
fears that an HIV/AIDS explosion could occur, the Indonesian
Observer reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
While the United Nations and the World Health Organization
estimate that there are about 500,000 HIV/AIDS cases in Indonesia,
official data puts the number at only 832.
</P>
<P>
An Indonesian association has expressed concern over the boom
in prostitution and the likely impact.
</P>
<P>
Numerous unemployed women, girls and young men have entered the
sex trade since the crisis started in mid-1997, when the official
number of HIV/AIDS cases was close to 400.
</P>
<P>
Rising unemployment has forced many young women to enter the
sex trade, and pimps often then get them hooked on expensive
drugs.
</P>
<P>
The association said it is seriously examining the sexual life
of needy people, including the homeless, street kids and
prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
Poor people generally practice unsafe sex, mainly because of
ignorance and indifference, rather than the price of condoms.
</P>
<P>
Another big problem is that many men refuse to use condoms when
employing the services of prostitutes, the association said.
</P>
<P>
A 20-year-old prostitute in South Jakarta complains that her
clients threaten not to pay her if she insists that they practice
safe sex.
</P>
<P>
"I need the money, so I don't care. I have two children, my
mother and younger sister to look after. My husband already left
me two years ago for another woman," she said.
</P>
<P>
The association said it is committed to curbing the incidence
of HIV/AIDS in Indonesia through a series of awareness campaigns.
</P>
<P>
The association held a seminar entitled "HIV/AIDS, Lifestyle
and the Monetary Crisis" at the Youth Sports Center in South
Jakarta over the weekend, which was attended by hundreds of people
keen to find out more about the deadly disease.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Highlights of Trade News (Feb. 23-28) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of China's weekly trade
news (February 23-28):
</P>
<P>
-- China has expressed "strong resentment" against the United
States administration's rejection of a satellite sale to the Asia
Pacific Mobile Telecommunications under the pretext of national
security interests, Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman urged the U.S. administration to correct its
erroneous decision, saying it is "groundless and will have a
negative effect on normal Sino-U.S. economic and trade exchanges
and cooperation."
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokeswomen Zhang Qiyue reiterated
China's stand to be a part of World Trade Organization (WTO)
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
She stated that China has always been holding a very positive
attitude towards the issue, and is having serious negotiations
with the United States on it.
</P>
<P>
-- China actually used 58.9 billion U.S. dollars of overseas
funds last year, down 7.9 percent from 1997, according to the
National Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Of the amount, overseas direct investment reached 45.6 billion
U.S. dollars, up 0.7 percent, while borrowing from overseas
declined by 8.5 percent to 11 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
-- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing met with visiting Vietnamese Party
chief Le Kha Phieu on Friday and discussed with him about
bilateral economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
China has been taking a positive attitude in developing
economic and trade cooperation with Vietnam, and is ready to
explore new means for expanding and deepening economic cooperation,
under the principles of equality and mutual benefit, taking into
consideration efficiency and quality, seeking common development
in various forms, in order to promote common prosperity, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged major companies to play positive roles, expand the
trade of bulk commodities, and encouraged enterprises of both
sides to cooperate in large projects, in order to promote healthy
and orderly trade ties between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Legislators-Pollution Treatment Local Legislators Say Pollution Controls Needed on Upper Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A proposal submitted by 132
deputies of the People's Congress of Sichuan Province to its
standing committee has proven useful in the government's decision
to deal with the heavily-polluted Minjiang River, a tributary of
the Yangtze, China's longest river.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, made last April after fishermen got in an uproar
over the loss of 215,000 kg of fish as a result of the pollution,
said that pollution controls are a must and cited the example of a
waterworks supplying 15,000 tons of tap water daily to the city of
Leshan that had to be closed because of contamination at the
source. A large amount of farmland along the river has also eroded.
</P>
<P>
The 700-km-long river has been polluted mainly by industrial
waste, fertilizer, and household waste that are discharged
randomly into it. The problem has been obvious for a long time but
the local government has not paid much attention to treatment or
is said to have deliberately avoided it, protecting important
taxpayers, who are often big polluters.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, however, has given the government a big push to
face the river pollution and Governor Song Baorui has pledged to
give it priority.
</P>
<P>
The provincial People's Congress Standing Committee recently
promised that it will oversee the effort over the next five years
to raise water quality to higher national standards. It will also
inspect industrial discharge to see that they meet national
standards.

<HEADLINE> French President Calls for Proper Solution to Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French President
Jacques Chirac said Sunday France hoped that the Kosovo crisis
would be solved properly.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with his Macedonian counterpart Kiro Gligorov
in Skopje, Chirac said the good wishes expressed by the two
conflicting sides would be important for a solution to the crisis,
adding that those responsible for the failure of the Rambouillet
talks would face serious consequences.
</P>
<P>
He said the Serb authorities and Kosovo ethnic Albanians should
work for peace since both sides want peace.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the ethnic Albanians accept autonomy and hand
in weapons, while the Serbs accept autonomy and the presence of
peace-keeping troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Chirac arrived in Skopje Sunday for a one-day visit to
Macedonia. He also inspected the French troops which joined the
NATO extraction force based in Kumanovo, near the border with the
separatist Serbian province of Kosovo, whose task is to protect
and coordinate with the OSCE (Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe) observers if necessary.

<HEADLINE> 5,000 Ecstasy Pills Seized by Police in Jakarta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Police arrested more than 15
people, including a policeman, and seized over 5,000 ecstasy pills
in a raid outside the entrance to the Ancol Theme Park in North
Jakarta Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The raid on motorists coming in and out of the fun park was
initiated at 11:00 p.m. Saturday night and ended at 2:00 a.m.
Sunday, the Indonesian Observer reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed policeman arrested in the swoop was pulled aside
for driving a police vehicle without a police number and necessary
documents, said Captain Rusyidi in charge of the sting.
</P>
<P>
The raid is the first in a series of swoops set to take place
over the next few weeks across all five of Jakarta's
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
During the raid launched by the Central Jakarta Police
Department at the Senen bus terminal on Sunday, an amphetamine
dealer and a handful of marijuana distributors were arrested.
</P>
<P>
According to Metro Jaya police spokesman Colonel Alex Bambang
Riatmodjo, drug consumption in Jakarta has increased rapidly due
to accelerated instances of heroin smuggling from overseas,
especially from the African continent.
</P>
<P>
In February alone, police arrested 65 persons who were
distributors and consumers of controlled substances and mostly
thugs and hoodlums, Alex said.

<HEADLINE> Five Students Killed in 25 Street Brawls in Jakarta This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Five students have been killed and
30 others injured in at least 25 street brawls recorded in the
first two months of this year in Jakarta, the Jakarta Post
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Raya Siahaan of the city's Social Disturbance Control Center
said this figure was quite alarming as in the whole of 1998 there
were only 14 students killed and 26 injured in 197 street brawls.
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand what the capital's future is," Raya said.
</P>
<P>
The center's data revealed that of the 197 brawls that took
place last year, 68 happened in South Jakarta, 37 in Central and
West Jakarta each, 29 in East Jakarta and 26 in North Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
He said that to prevent warring groups of students from
recognizing each other, schools were urged last year to encourage
their students to change from school uniform into casual clothes.
</P>
<P>
This method apparently did not work as well as expected as
warring groups of students were able to recognize one another.
</P>
<P>
"What cannot be understood is why the brawls happen so
frequently," he said.
</P>
<P>
Raya reiterated that it was now time for the police to take
really stern measures against students involved in brawling in
order to help reduce fatalities.
</P>
<P>
"With stern measures students should learn their lessons," he
said.
</P>
<P>
City councilor Nitra Arsyad said the main problem was that
students today have "absolutely no fear" of the police and the
military.
</P>
<P>
Nitra expressed concern over the inability on the part of
police and the military to locate any student brawling.
</P>
<P>
"Both the military and the police can actually use intelligence
officers to locate the student leaders," he added.

BRUSSELS, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Johan Museeuw was beaten into
second place in the Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne cycling race by fellow

</P>

Museeuw's career appeared to be over when he suffered a broken
knee cap, blocked kidneys from a blood infection and the early
stages of gangrene 10 months ago.
</P>
<P>
But the Mapei-Quick Step team captain refused to believe his
days in the saddle were over and came close to a gutsy win on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Planckaert and his Lotto team mate Andrei Tchmil combined to
thwart him. Tchmil closed to within 40 meters of Planckaert and
Museeuw who had escaped from a group of 19 riders about seven
kilometres from the line.
</P>
<P>
Museeuw, aware of Tchmil's danger, launched his dash for the

<HEADLINE> Thailand Wants Cambodia to Expand Mine-Clearing Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Thailand wants Cambodia to expand
mine-clearing operations along the borders so as to turn their
front-line into a safe passage, a newspaper report said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Vasu Chanarat, director-general of the Thailand Mine Action
Center, will visit Phnom Penh later this month to seek Cambodia
cooperation in mine-clearing operations, according to Bangkok
Post.
</P>
<P>
Exchange of visits between the two countries is part of the
cooperation agreement on anti-personnel landmines signed in Si Sa
Ket, northern Thailand by Thai Deputy Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand
Patribatra and Cambodian Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs and
International Cooperation Khong Sam Nuon.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also pledged joint lobbying efforts to
garner international aid to combat mines that have claimed lives
or maimed villagers along their border.
</P>
<P>
Thailand wants to clear the mines along its border with
Cambodia within three years.
</P>
<P>
Almost 800 square kilometers of the border areas are riddled
with mines, including 530 kilometers along the frontier with
Cambodia. The highest density of the explosive devices are in Sa
Kaew, Surin and Trat provinces.
</P>
<P>
Key problems which could delay the plan were the ill-defined
line separating the two nations and threats from Khmer Rouge
guerrillas, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Vasu was quoted by the report as saying that he would propose
the creation of a liaison office for closer coordination during
his visit to Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
Ieng Mouly, chairman of the Cambodian Mine Action Center,
welcomed this initiative, saying his center was ready to work with
the Thai side, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
However, Ieng conceded that Cambodia's main focus was on inner
areas where mine removal could make way for the homeless and
refugees to live and farm.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia receives about 13 million U.S. dollars a year from
international donors to finance landmine clearing operations.

Surin.
</P>
<P>
Surin said he would talk with Albright on the matter when she
visits Thailand. Surin had just returned from Europe where he
lobbied the European Union to support Supachai and back a speedy
selection process.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the United States had indicated its
support for Roy Maclaren, Canada's high commissioner in London.
Other candidates are New Zealand's former premier Michael Moore
and Morocco's Hassan Abouyoub.
</P>
<P>
Consultations among WTO members have been going on for months
and they are to establish which candidate can be appointed by
consensus. Only if that cannot be established could a formal vote
be held.
</P>
<P>
Surin said, "We would not want to see the consensus-seeking
drag on beyond the scheduled March 12."
</P>
<P>
The term of the current WTO chief, Italy's Renato Ruggiero,
expires at the end of April.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Women Becoming More Modern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The women of China's Tibet
Autonomous Region are becoming more modern in their dress,
hairstyle, and other ways, and just as fashionable as the women of
coastal cities.
</P>
<P>
A number of far-sighted business people have opened boutiques
in Tibet in recent years that sell brand-name dresses and
cosmetics and well-known brands from China and Europe can be found
on the streets.
</P>
<P>
Gesang Zhoima, a 58-year old Tibetan woman, said: "I really
envy the young women nowadays. They can dress as beautifully as
they like, which is quite different from what it used to be."
</P>
<P>
"I also wanted to wear nice clothes when I was young, but it
was only a dream because we couldn't even make ends meet. My
father was a serf, and we often had nothing to eat at all for days
on end," she added.
</P>
<P>
Dawa, a 20-year old Tibetan woman, works as a nurse and changes
into fashionable clothes or a traditional costume when she gets
off work.
</P>
<P>
"Beautiful clothes bring me great happiness and keep me in high
spirits, even though some dresses cost me nearly 1,000 yuan. It's
worth it," she said.
</P>
<P>
A well-known fashion designer in Lhasa, Danba Yabdam, said that
it is not only women who follow fashions because Tibetans can now
afford more and want to improve their lives with what they have
earned.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that 90 percent of Tibetan families
today have TV sets, 60 percent have refrigerators, 46 percent have
cameras, 45 percent have washing machines, and over 80 percent use
gas, electricity, and solar energy in their daily lives.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Says Ready to Talk With Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
Sunday expressed their readiness for talks with the opposition on
ceasefire and exchange of prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready for talks with the opposition for ceasefire and
exchange of prisoners of war if they show sincerity," the
Taliban's interim council head, Mohammad Rabbani, told visiting
U.N. Special Envoy on Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi in Kabul,
according to a report monitored here Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi arrived in the Afghan capital Sunday morning for talks
with Taliban leaders on his fresh peace initiative and matters
concerning security for U.N. staff in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban leader called for the return of U.N. international
staff to Afghanistan and its efforts for the reconstruction of the
war-ravaged country. He gave full assurance to the U.N. envoy of
protection of the U.N. staff.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. evacuated its international staff from the country in
August last year after the killing of a senior Italian U.N.
officer.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi also discussed with Taliban leaders the human rights
situation in Afghanistan and the proposed Six Plus Two
(Afghanistan's six immediate neighbors and the United States and
Russia) meeting in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. The U.N. will try to
achieve good results from the meeting, the envoy said.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi has been trying to convene the so-called Six Plus Two
meeting which is expected to review progress towards Afghan peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations wants to see a broad-based government
grouping all factions, political parties and ethnic groups to end
the agony of 20 years of conflict.
</P>
<P>
The envoy, who arrived in Islamabad last week, will open talks
with Afghan opposition leaders in Peshawar, capital of Pakistan's
North West Frontier Province, on Monday.

Italy's Rainbow Telephone association, formed to counter child

in a Spanish Internet site which promised the free exchange of
child porn.

"The operator pretended to be a pedophile and then it took four
months to win the confidence of the organization to get them to
send us a list of 92 members", the association said.

In recent weeks, Rainbow Telephone brought to light and
reported to Italian authorities about 20 other pedophile sites, "a

involving thousands of children aged between two and 12 years,"

LONDON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- German midfielder Dietmar
Hamann rescued a point for Newcastle and dented Arsenal's hopes of
retaining the Premiership title with a superb equaliser at St
James Park on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Nicolas Anelka had given Arsenal a half-time lead thanks to
some dreadful defending but Alan Shearer was also to blame for the
north eastern side falling behind.
</P>
<P>
He had already missed a golden chance, failing to hit a
virtually open goal eight minutes before Anelka's successful
strike.
</P>
<P>
His German teammate - who fell out with manager Ruud Gullit
less than two months ago - eventually showed him the way and
struck 13 minutes from time with a superb curling shot from the
edge of the area.
</P>
<P>
It leaves Arsenal seven points adrift of leaders Manchester
United with one game in hand.

<HEADLINE> Rusedski Out-gunned in London Indoor Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Local hero Greg Rusedski missed
the chance of victory in front of his own fans as Richard Krajicek
won the battle of the big-servers in the final of the Guardian
Direct Cup London Indoor tennis tournament in Battersea Park on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The British No. 2, roared on by a partisan crowd, had no answer
to some inspired backhand returns from Dutch star Krajicek, who
wrapped up a deserved 7-6, 6-7, 7-5 victory.
</P>
<P>
A clash between two of the fastest servers in the world game
hardly promised the most subtle of contests - and indeed serve was
not broken until the 29th game.
</P>
<P>
But the brutal precision with which the big-hitting duo went
about their business ensured a taut, and at times gripping
encounter in front of a packed arena under canvas in south London.
</P>
<P>
Rallies were always at a premium - but when the players did get
to play their shots they responded with some entertaining
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Krajicek chose his victory speech to remember his friend and
Dutch doubles specialist Menno Oosting, who died in a car crash
last week and whose funeral he attended in the Netherlands on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I want to dedicate this title to Menno Oosting," said a
visibly moved Krajicek. "His funeral was really emotional and I
wish his wife all the strength she needs to get through this tough
time.
</P>
<P>
"I hope he is in a good place," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski, accepting defeat gracefully, joked: "Now I know what
its like to play against myself when I'm serving well!
</P>
<P>
"Richard was unbelievable - his serves were phenomenal and
deserved to win because he was the better player today," said the
Briton.
</P>
<P>
On a fast court, the Dutch fourth seed Krajicek slotted into
the serving groove that won him Wimbledon in 1996 and comfortably
took the battle between two of the hardest hitters in the men's
game. He lost only two service games during the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Third seed Rusedski, bidding to become the first Briton to win
a men's title in London for 24 years, served faster than his
opponent and took the only set off Krajicek this week.
</P>
<P>
But he served just 10 aces and was more fragile on the big
points. He almost saved himself from defeat with a display of
gamesmanship late in the game, asking a ball girl to play against
Krajicek after the Dutchman served an ace.
</P>
<P>
The change of mood unsettled Krajicek who lost the next three
points, allowing Rusedski to break back to 4-4.
</P>
<P>
But a double fault on break point in the 11th game saw justice
done and Krajicek won on his second match point.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski brushed aside the ball girl incident as irrelevant but
Krajicek said he almost paid for a "rookie's mistake" by allowing
the pretend rally.
</P>
<P>
"The next time Greg is serving me off the court I know what I
will do. I'll let a ball girl hit a couple of balls," Krajicek
said wryly.
</P>
<P>
"But I'm the one who allowed it to happen, I'm the one to blame.
I should have aced her and told Greg 'she can't return it either
so don't worry about it'. "
</P>
<P>
For long periods of the final it was nothing more than a
serving competition and the first rally of more than five strokes
did not come until the ninth game.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski had the better of the first set, earning a break point
in his opponent's opening service game. He failed to capitalise
and Krajicek took it with a simple smash on his second set point
in the tiebreak.
</P>
<P>
The second set was a mirror image of the first with more hard
serving, intermingled with the occasional volley behind a serve.
</P>
<P>
Krajicek lost the tiebreak despite pulling himself 5-4 ahead
with two aces. He could do little to prevent Rusedski going 6-5 up
but then served his fifth double fault of the match.

<HEADLINE>   England Door Opens for Venables </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It had been widely reported that Noel White, chairman of the
Football Association's international committee, was totally
opposed to Venables becoming the permanent successor to Glenn
Hoddle.
</P>
<P>
Venables, who left the job after a two-year stint that
culminated in the semi-finals of Euro 96, was said to have quit
because of run-ins with White over the legal problems he faced at
that time.
</P>
<P>
And the former Tottenham and Barcelona boss publicly ruled
himself out of the running for the job - because he thought he
could never regain the backing of the FA.
</P>
<P>
But White has dismissed speculation that personal animosity
between the pair meant Venables could never resume the position.
</P>
<P>
"We will look at certain names put before us and Terry's will
almost certainly be among those," said White.
</P>
<P>
"I've never queried his coaching qualities and never would.
Nobody but nobody will be discounted.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is saying that Terry Venables will not be the next
England coach. He could do a good job. The baggage that he had
around him the last time seems to have gone away. I hope it has
for his sake, " he added.
</P>
<P>
White insisted coaching qualifications would be paramount,
despite Hoddle's departure over non-footballing matters when he
made controversial comments on the disabled.
</P>
<P>
"We wouldn't, say, put Joe Bloggs to one side because he's said
to be a womaniser or because he's a drunkard or anything else you
care to mention," White added.
</P>
<P>
"We want to assess everybody thoroughly before making a
decision."
</P>
<P>
FA chiefs are looking for a permanent coach after caretaker
boss Kevin Keegan completes his four-match reign in June.
</P>
<P>
Venables, who has the backing of a number of leading figures in
the game, including Tony Adams, Bryan Robson and John Gregory,
would now appear to be one of the favourites for the job.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- More than eight million employees
in Shanghai have had a soothing feeling learning that the city
will soon launch a massive IC card project, giving more protection
to employment and social welfare.
</P>
<P>
The IC card project, whose design has been finished and is on
the way to start operation, will oversee the overall employment
picture in the changing situations.
</P>
<P>
Based on the computer network and integrated circuit (IC)
technology, the project enables departments to keep track on
employee's training and welfare status and exercise macro-control
in accordance with the market demand for employees.
</P>
<P>
The lifelong card will keep the latest information on Shanghai
people's employment status, medical care, pensions, accumulation
funds and other insurances.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the launch of the project will fundamentally
transform the municipal government's administration pattern of
overall employment and the traditional choice pattern of
professions.

<HEADLINE> Venus Beats Coetzer to Retain Oklahoma City Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Venus Williams retained the
title at the IGA Superthrift Tennis Classic by cruising past
Amanda Coetzer in straight sets in Oklahoma City on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The top seed, who claimed her first WTA Tour title in Oklahoma
City last year, romped to a 6-4, 6-0 victory over the third seeded
South African in just 58 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Venus's younger sister, Serena, claimed her
first career title by winning the Gaz de France Open in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The big-hitting 18-year-old American sailed through the
tournament without losing a set, but still was not entirely
satisfied with her play.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I played so well in the first set. I think my
unforced error count was a bit high. But maybe Amanda's the type
of player that makes you hit some errors," Williams said.
</P>
<P>
But Coetzer, also a finalist here in 1996, had no answers for
the top seed's power or shotmaking.
</P>
<P>
Despite her critique of her early play, Williams opened the
match by breaking Coetzer's serve and closed out the first set by
belting three successive aces.
</P>
<P>
The second set lasted just 21 minutes as Williams came up with
three more three service breaks and three additional aces to take
her total to 10 for the match.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Invites U.S. to Help Investigate Explosions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
invited the United States government to provide expert assistance
in the investigations of the series of explosions which rocked
capital Lusaka late Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a nation-wide address on Sunday night, Zambian Information
and Broadcasting Minister Newstead Zimba said that Zambia also
leaves the door open for other goodwill countries to send in their
experts to investigate the explosions.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The terrorist acts are aimed at destabilizing peace
the Zambian people have always cherished."
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government will leave no stone unturned to bring
those behind the attacks to book, whether they are foreigners or
locals, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He called upon all Zambians to fully cooperate with the
security forces in maintaining lasting peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has made sacrifices for the peace in southern Africa and
Africa as a whole, said the minister, noting "Zambia's role has
been that of bridge builders. This is the role we cherish and this
is the role we will continue to play."
</P>
<P>
In the explosion at the Angolan Embassy to Lusaka, one Angolan
security officer was killed and another Angolan injured.

<HEADLINE> Irish Republicans Hold Protest Over Decommissioning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- A few thousand Irish
republicans marched in Belfast on Sunday to protest against
pro-British unionists for stalling a peace deal in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The protesters expressed their anger at unionists, who insist
that the local assembly cannot start as planned on March 10 unless
the Irish Republican Army hand over at least part of its weapons,
according to Reuters report from Belfast.
</P>
<P>
"We seek partnership for a future as equals," Mitchell
McLaughlin, chairman for the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, told
the Belfast rally.
</P>
<P>
"We can do business with positive unionism," he said, but
denounced "unionist stalling". The theme for the march was "End
the unionist veto -- implement the (Good Friday) agreement".
</P>
<P>
The IRA has been holding to a ceasefire in its war against
British rule since July 1997. But the unionists say they will not
sit in the Northern Ireland executive with Sinn Fein unless the
IRA gives up arms to prove that the ceasefire is meant to be
permanent.
</P>
<P>
The IRA has repeatedly refused to give up weapons and Sinn Fein
officials insist there were no preconditions for this contained in
the Northern Ireland peace agreement aimed at ending the
30-year-long conflict.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why U.N. Peace-Keeping Fails in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council has adopted a resolution, deciding to call off U.N.
observer mission in Angola starting from February 26.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution, which adopted Friday, said that the U.N.
observer team could not carry out its mission in Angola because a
full-scale civil war reoccurred there.
</P>
<P>
The world organization had sent some 700 observers to the
war-ravaged country and spent nearly two billion U.S. Dollars for
the peace process in Angola since 1995 after the Angolan
government and the rebel UNITA signed a peace accord in Zambian
capital Lusaka in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. peace-keeping efforts did bring hope for the Angolan
people who suffered a lot in the war and have been longing for a
lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
However, the hope was shattered when fierce fighting renewed in
central highlands last November between the government troops and
the forces of Jonas Savimbi's National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government led by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
is determined to wipe out the forces of the tough-line UNITA
leader while the rebels are seeking every chance to attack the
government.
</P>
<P>
Even when the two sides sat down at the negotiation table, both
of them were still busy preparing for war, aiming to defeat the
other.
</P>
<P>
Savimbi had refused to surrender some strongholds to the
control of the government in line with the 1994 Lusaka Peace
Protocol.
</P>
<P>
Last September, the dos Santos government declared Savimbi as
a "war criminal" and would only hold dialogue with the UNITA
Renovation Committee, a breakaway group of the rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission twice declared that the UNITA had dismissed
all of its troops. But when the civil war broke out again, the
UNITA forces still appeared very strong and were even armed with
tanks, surface-to-air missiles and long-range artillery.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noted that the the U.N. observers were not able
to prevent the UNITA from rearming its troops under the background
that some western powers feared a peaceful Angola would break "the
existing power balance in the region."
</P>
<P>
For these countries, keeping the UNITA "as a strong opposition"
in Angola is in their best interests, the analysts maintained.
</P>
<P>
With such factors, it's hard for the U.N. observers to be very
serious and strict in carrying out their mission.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the international community has not made enough
efforts for ending conflicts in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Despite three resolutions adopted by the U.N. Security Council
to impose sanctions against the UNITA, some countries are still
allowing the rebel group to smuggling large amount of diamonds to
exchange for arms it badly needs.
</P>
<P>
As far as the U.N. oberver team is concerned, the analysts
noted, its " even-handed" stance toward Angola's two warring
parties is not appropriate in view of the practical situation in
Angola.
</P>
<P>
As the UNITA refused to implement the agreed peace accords,
what the U.N. observer mission had done was only push the two
sides to meet each other halfway. Thus, the Angolan government
became angry with the world body.
</P>
<P>
The analysts noted what U.N. observer mission should do is to
firmly adhere to the principle of supporting those who deserve
support and punishing those who deserve punishment.

<P>
LONDON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- A woman was detained on Sunday in
connection with the Omagh bombing, bringing to four the number being
held for questioning over the attack that killed 29 people last
August.
</P>
<P>
The suspect was arrested in Dublin on Sunday morning, according to
the Irish police, a BBC television report said in London.
</P>
<P>
The name of the suspect was not released.
</P>

On Saturday morning, two men were arrested in the town of Dundalk,
near the border between the Irish Republic and the British province
of Northern Ireland. A third man was arrested in the same area later
on the same day.
</P>
<P>
The three men were being questioned 30 miles from Dundalk in
Monaghan police station and can be detained for up to three days

<HEADLINE> Jordan's New King Continues Peace Policy: Netanyahu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said here Sunday that he sees clearly Jordan's new king
is carrying out his father's policy, a policy of peace in the
Middle East affairs.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at a press conference after meeting Jordan's
new King Abdullah Bin Hussein during his one-day visit to Amman.
</P>
<P>
His trip here was widely believed to amend his earlier comments
on Jordan-Iraq relations, in which he said Jordan will again ally
with Iraq in confronting Israel.
</P>
<P>
Amman sided with Baghdad when President Saddam Hussein's troops
stormed into Kuwait, which triggered the Gulf War that led to
Iraq's defeat by U.S.-led coalition forces.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said that during their two-hour meeting, Netanyahu
and Abdullah reiterated their commitments to the 1994 peace
treaty, and pledged to work for a broader peace between Israel and
Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu hailed his country's 1994 peace treaty with Jordan as
a model for peace with Arab countries. Jordan was considered
Israel's only close friend in the Arab world during the last years
of the reign of late King Hussein Bin Talal.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu expressed appreciation of the "stable and strong
leadership of King Abdullah," who acceded to the throne on
February 7, hours after his father died of lymphatic cancer.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent bid to soothe the largely Palestinian
population of Jordan, Netanyahu said at the press conference that
he would work for peace with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"We reaffirmed our commitment to bolster peace between us and
also continue to strive for peace with the Palestinians," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he accused the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) of
failing "to collect weapons among Palestinian radicals, curb
incitement and subversive activities against the Jewish state."
</P>
<P>
He said Israel would continue to implement the Wye Accord and
hand over the additional 5 percent of the West Bank if the PNA
disarmed radicals and cracked down on "terrorists plotting attacks
on Israel."
</P>
<P>
Last December Israel balked at continuing implementing the Wye
River accord pending its coming elections. The accord was brokered

King Hussein.

The PNA and Israel have often traded accusations over the
suspension of the accord.

Also at the news conference, Jordanian Prime Minister Fayez
Tarawaneh said that Jordan would "use its good relations with all
countries for the benefit of peace" in the region.

<HEADLINE> Irregularities Not Affecting Overall Results of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. President Jimmy
Carter said Sunday that his observer team has no evidence
indicating that the electoral abuses have affected the overall
outcome of Saturday's presidential election in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Carter, co-leader of the observer team from the Carter
Center and National Democratic Institute, told reporters in
capital Abuja that the February 27 election witnessed serious
irregularities in a number of states in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the irregularities included ballot box stuffing,
inflated vote tallies and manipulation of results of the election.
 Many of these electoral abuses were a result of collusion between
polling officials, party agents and operatives, he added.
</P>
<P>
In some cases, according to the chief observer, after a few
voters were observed at polling stations, more than 80 percent of
them were later alleged to have voted and the votes counted were
overwhelmingly in favor of one of the two candidates.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that despite the development, it nevertheless
 compromised the integrity of the process in the areas where the
irregularities occurred.
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Carter urged the Independent National Electoral
Commission (INEC) of Nigeria to investigate all documented reports
submitted to it and make those responsible accountable according
to the law.
</P>
<P>
He called on persons aggrieved about the conduct of the
presidential election to seek redress in courts.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was important the parties keep to the han-dover
 date and consolidate on certain factors such as the commitment of
the head of state, integrity of the INEC, participation and
commitment of the Nigerians which have made the transition to
civil rule work.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Says 'No Possibility' of IRA Arms Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- A Sinn Fein leader
unequivocally ruled out on Sunday any prospect that the Irish
Republican Army, or IRA will begin to decommission its weapons
before the establishment of an executive for the Northern Ireland
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on BBC One's On the Record, Martin McGuinness, Sinn
Fein's chief negotiator, said there was not even "the remotest
possibility" of a handover since it was "a demand for the
surrender of the IRA".
</P>
<P>
The issue of decommissioning is threatening to completely stall
the Northern Ireland peace process, because the Ulster Unionists -
the largest party in the assembly - are refusing to work with Sinn
Fein, the political wing of the IRA, unless paramilitary weapons
are given up.
</P>
<P>
"What's it all about? It's effectively all about being unable
to accept that in the course of 30 years that they hadn't the
ability to militarily defeat the IRA," said McGuinness.
</P>
<P>
He also accused the Ulster Unionists of shifting the
responsibility for handing over weapons to Sinn Fein and said they
were trying to undermine the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
"The difficulty we have is that one of those participants, the
Ulster Unionist party, has chosen unilaterally to decide how the
decommissioning issue should be resolved... and they have
effectively attempted to turn everybody else against the
agreement. We can't allow that to happen."
</P>
<P>
He said it was only because the IRA had called a ceasefire that
the issue of decommissioning had arisen and said that British
"militarists" had used it to try and derail the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for the establishment of an executive for the
assembly is March 10 and diplomatic efforts are intensifying in an
attempt to secure a solution to the standoff.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Retaliation, But No Operation Grapes of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 28 (Xinhua) -- As expected, the Israeli
government and army decided Sunday to wage a massive ground, air
and sea attack on Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon in retaliation
for the killing of four Israelis, including a general.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Moshe Arens
and Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz made the announcement at a
hurriedly-arranged news conference in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
This came several hours after Israel suffered what could
almost be called its worst loss in the self-styled security zone
in south Lebanon since Israeli invasion in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Three Israeli soldiers, including a general, and one civilian
were killed when Hezbollah guerrillas detonated two bombs near
their convoy in the security zone.
</P>
<P>
For Israel, this was the most serious fatality in Lebanon
since September 1997 when 12 Israeli navy commandos were slain in
a botched action there.
</P>
<P>
And Brig.-Gen Erez Gerstein, 38, the head of the Israeli
military liaison unit with the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army,
became the highest-ranking Israeli officer killed in south Lebanon
since the 1982 Israeli invasion.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the bombing attack was the second serious blow to the
Israeli army in less than one week. Last Tuesday, three Israeli
officers and five soldiers were wounded in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Against these backdrops, a massive retaliation was somewhat
expected.
</P>
<P>
But Netanayhu refrained from giving the military offensive a
name like Operation Grapes of Wrath, also a massive attack
lauched by former prime minister Shimen Peres in early 1996 to
punish Hezbollah for its attacks on northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
That operation was also regarded as an election card played by
Peres, though it turned out to be a failed one. He launched the
offensive less than two months before the Israeli election in an
effort to show his firmness on security issues.
</P>
<P>
But with hundreds of innocent civilians losing their lives in
the war, Peres lost tens of thousands of votes from Arab
Israelis, who played a decisive role in his neck-to-neck
competition with Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Peres launched the operation to show the voters that he was not
soft before terrorist attacks, but Netanyahu needs not do this,
because he is hard-line enough.
</P>
<P>
So he will avoid escalating too high the situation in south
Lebanon. A limited offensive would do him better than an all-out
war at this time when the general election in Israel is just two
months away.
