wide demonstrations protesting against the killing of two lawyers

and its allies -- Jatiya Party, Jamaat-e- Islam and Islami Oikya
Jote(Islami Solidarity Front) held rallies separately in the
capital before bringing out processions in the city. The
demonstrations and processions ended peacefully Monday evening.

morning and a lawyer of the ruling Awami League was shot dead on
the same day by gunmen in Bagerhat town, 370 kilometers southwest
of Dhaka. the motives behind the killings were not known
immediately.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance has called half-day general strike on
August 23 and dawn to dusk general strike on August 30 across the
country in protest against the killings.
</P>
<P>
Addressing rallies in the capital Sunday, opposition leaders
pointed out that killing is a regular affair today and law and
order situation totally collapsed. Jatiya Party Chairman and
former President Hussain Mohammad Ershad said that "fall of this
government is a must today" to save the people and the existence
of the country.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance which had earlier decided to launch a
militant movement from mid-September now plans to intensify the
oust-government towards the end of this month following the
killing of the lawyers and the price hike of gas and petroleum
products.
</P>
<P>
Opposition sources claimed that there are now a number of "hot
issues", including the price increase of fuel, prime minister's
remarks on the judiciary, deterioration of law and order and
teachers' strike.
</P>
<P>
The government on last Monday suddenly increased the prices of
fuel oil and on last Wednesday made an announcement to enhance the
price of gas by 15 percent from September 1.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said that the price hike will have a far reaching
negative impact on the cost of power, fertilizer, industrial and
agricultural products and above all, the cost of living.

<HEADLINE> UAE Calls for Defending Jerusalem's Arab Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Sultan bin Zayed Al Nahyan,
deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, has called on
the international community to defend the Arab status of Jerusalem
and to totally condemn the Israeli attempts to judaize the city.
</P>
<P>
Sultan, who is also the chairman of the Zayed Centre for
Coordination and Follow-up, made the remark on the 31st anniversary
of the "arson attack" on the Al-Aqsa mosque, reported the official
news agency WAM on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A deranged Australian tourist tried to burned down the Al-Aqsa
mosque 31 years ago. The Al-Aqsa and Dome of the Rock mosques are
located in the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, the third holiest site in
Islam.
</P>
<P>
The day of the "arson attack" on the Al-Aqsa mosque, according
to local media, is to be announced by the Arab and the Islamic
nations as an international day.
</P>
<P>
Sultan said the occasion calls for a unified Arab stance to face
the challenges threatening the Arab nation, adding that Arab
countries in particular, and Islamic and friendly countries must
support the Palestinians in this historic stage of their peaceful
struggle for the establishment of an independent state on their own
land.
</P>
<P>
The fate of Jerusalem is the crux in the final status talks
between Israel and the Palestinians, who have set the September 13
as the target date for a comprehensive peace to end their 50-year
conflict.
</P>
<P>
But the difference over the status of Jerusalem, which claimed
by both Israel and the Palestinians as their capital, has led to
the collapse of the latest Israeli-Palestinian peace talks on July
25.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sultan also described the Israeli settlements in the
holy city will never change the reality of the city's history,
which is boldly inscribed in the mind and heart of all Arabs and
all peace-loving people in the world.

<HEADLINE> Foreigners Warned Not to Buy Greek Cypriot Property in Northern Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government on Tuesday
warned foreigners against buying the property left over by the
Greek Cypriots who were evicted by the Turkish Cypriot-controlled
northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Anybody buying Greek Cypriot property in northern Cyprus through
illegal means should know they will not be able to keep it, the
Cyprus government warned.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during his first briefing after returning from his
summer holidays, government spokesman Michalis Papapetrou said the
government will not condone under any circumstances such purchases.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou made the remarks in response to reports in the
British press that British and German nationals have bought or
leased property belonging to Greek Cypriots from Turkish Cypriots
or Turks in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern the third of the island in the wake of a failed coup
seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Greek Cypriots who fled the Turkish Cypriot north as the Turkish
troops advanced in the summer of 1974, left behind millions of
dollars worth of property.
</P>
<P>
Titina Loizidou, a Greek Cypriot woman, who owns a property in
northern Cyprus, took her case to the European Court of Human
Rights of the Council of Europe against Turkey and won her right
and access to her property.

<P>
CAIRO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid on Tuesday welcomed the inauguration of Somalia's
first parliament in a decade and lauded the move as a success of
the Somali people.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid hailed the organization of the transition
parliament as "a basic pillar for the restoration of a united
Somali state," saying that the Somali people have "achieved an
important success in the reconciliation process."
</P>
<P>
He called on the Somali factions to "work seriously, honestly
and interactively to help Somalia restore its status as an active
Arab, regional and international entity."
</P>
<P>
The pan-Arab forum chief paid tribute to the leading role played
by Djiboutian President Ismael Omar Guelleh in hammering out the
Somali peace plan.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League is ready to do whatever it can to back Somalia's
further steps in the reconciliation process, and urges the
international community to provide political and economic support
to help Somalia fulfill its goals of reuniting the country, Abdel-
Meguid said.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has been in division since the 1991 fall of President
Siad Barre. On August 13, the country's first parliament in a
decade was inaugurated in Arta, Djibouti, after 100 days of talks
sponsored by Guelleh. A Somali central government is expected to
come into being by early September.

LAGOS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's rebel Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) said on Tuesday that Foday Sankoh remained to
be its leader and that General Issa Sesay was only interim head of
the group.
</P>
<P>
The British Broadcasting Cooperation (BBC) quoted spokesman for
the RUF Jibril Massaquoi as saying that Issa Sesay would negotiate

Sankoh has been detained by the Sierra Leone government since
his capture in May in the capital Freetown and faces trial for
human rights offences by a court authorized by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leone government said in a statement on Monday that
RUF' s battlefield commander Issa Sesay was named to replace Foday
Sankoh, adding that it received the information of the leadership
change from Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo and Malian
President and ECOWAS chairman Alpha Konare who are on a mission to
Sierra Leone and Liberia to try to restore peace process in Sierra

<HEADLINE> Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical Firms Form International Data Consortium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A multinational group of
biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have formed a
consortium aimed at establishing common computing standards for
data and information analyses related to gene-based drug
development.
</P>
<P>
The launch of BioPathways Consortium was announced Tuesday at
an international conference on intelligent systems for molecular
biology held in San Diego, California.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of the consortium was organized by 3rd
Millennium, a U.S. consultancy firm focused on genomics and life
science informatics, in partnership with Hybrigenics, a Paris-
based functional proteomics and bioinformatic company.
</P>
<P>
Genomics-related information has been accumulated by thousands
of companies, government agencies and academic institutions
worldwide, with literally dozens of different formats, said the
new group in a statement. The lack of a single information
standard worldwide prevents intelligent linking and sharing of
information and is considered to be a major obstacle to more rapid
development of gene-based pharmaceutical and other products.
</P>
<P>
"The Consortium is being formed to develop wholly new
information technologies needed to support the accrual,
organization, analyses, and efficient access of genomic
information," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The group will be working to set new standards for data on
biologically important pathways and interactions, the targets of
the industry effort underway to development pharmaceuticals and
other products which act on genetic and molecular bases of
diseases. Specifically, it will target the development of
computing information standards related to biochemical pathways --
all forms of molecular exchanges and processes which can involve
linear processing, cyclic phenomena, branched pathways or complex
combinations of all three.
</P>
<P>
Immediate objectives of the consortium include identification
of specific needs for informatics standards related to genomics
and proteomics research and development of Web-based venues for
discussion and sharing of relevant software tools.

<HEADLINE> Italy Fights Against Forest Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Minister for Agriculture
Alfonso Pecoraro Scanio Tuesday called for the installation of
forest watchtowers as another in a battery of measures designed to
control the fires that have already devastated over 66,000
hectares of countryside this year.
</P>
<P>
Before going on summer vacation, the government approved an
emergency measure introducing the crime of forest arson with a
jail sentence from two to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
In another measure, Pecoraro Scanio, who is responsible for the
country's Forestry Corps with its mix of policing and
environmental tasks, set up a national forest arson investigative
unit on the lines of similar anti-Mafia units.
</P>
<P>
This year, the surface area burned by fire has risen by about
20 percent, and the number of fires has risen from 4,978 to 7,282
with 2,193 in August alone, the Forestry Corps said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But, despite the rise in surface area burned, the corps said
less woodland was destroyed, 26,571 against 31,730 hectares, and
the average surface area per fire fell from 11.4 to 9.1 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Half the fires were in southern Italy which by itself accounted
for 594 fires in the first 20 days of August. But in the last few
days the fire front has also shifted north.
</P>
<P>
The situation was said to be critical in the central region of
Umbria, with most of the blazes traceable to arson.
</P>
<P>
Pecoraro Scanio said he hopes to get several million U.S.
dollars from the next budget to the regional government, which is
now responsible for the environment, to build the watchtowers, "at
least in national and regional parks and areas where each summer
sees a fire emergency."

</P>
<P>
This is the biggest seizure of ecstasy in Canadian history. The
previous record-breaking catch of 144,000 pills was reported in
May at Montreal's Dorval International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Two Toronto men are being charged with smuggling the drugs
originated from Belgium after they were found in a railway
shipment bound for Toronto from Montreal.
</P>
<P>
Ecstasy, an amphetamine taken to fuel non-stop dancing, can
lead to death through heat exhaustion, dehydration and kidney and
heart failure.
</P>
<P>
Seven ecstasy-related deaths have been reported in Toronto for
the first half of the year, compared with nine in all of 1999.

<HEADLINE> 3 Kids Killed, 1 Injured in Explosion in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Three children were killed and
another one injured Tuesday afternoon in a mine or shell explosion
in south Lebanon, ANN television station reported.
</P>
<P>
Witness said the kids were playing near a former Israeli
position at the village of Braishit in south Lebanon. "They found a
metal and picked it up to see it, then the mine or a shell
exploded," said a boy who saw the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the children and the injured have been sent to the
hospital in the city of Tyre.
</P>
<P>
So far, nine people were killed and more than 50 others wounded,
mostly children, by mines or suspected shells in the Israeli-
vacated south Lebanon since it withdrew its troops on May 24 after
a 22-year occupation.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese military has warned people not to touch suspected
objects and drive on unpaved roads in the south.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian mine-cleaning unit serving in the United Nations
Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) complained that the maps if
minefields in south Lebanon provided by Israel is inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Israel left behind more than 130,000 mines,
only a small amount of which have been removed. Even worse, many
places in the area have also been mined during the 1975-1990 civil
war in the country.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Reforms Must Comply with Constitution: Khatami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
stressed here on Tuesday that reforms in the country should be in
conformity with the constitution and not violate the fundamentals
of Islam.
</P>
<P>
The reforms in the political, cultural and economic fields
should comply with the constitution, and they should not be defined
as means to topple the Islamic republic, Khatami said on the
occasion of the third anniversary of his inauguration as president.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the state broadcasting network, he stressed
that people's freedom and fundamental rights should be protected,
but freedom and rights should not violate the law and Islamic
principles.
</P>
<P>
Khatami won a landslide victory in the presidential election in
1997 on account of his advocates for political and social reforms.
</P>
<P>
Since he took office, the political atmosphere in the country
has become more and more active, as seen through the emergence of a
large number of political parties and outspoken newspapers.
</P>
<P>
In February, the sixth parliamentary election was held with a
high rate of public participation and Khatami's reformist allies
won an overwhelming victory over their conservative opponents.
</P>
<P>
The victory showed that Khatami's reform programs had gained
widespread support among the people, who were tired of the long-
time political and social restrictions imposed by the conservative
establishment.
</P>
<P>
However, the reformist victory in February caused concern among
the conservatives, or the guardians of the restrictive cleric rule,
who are still controlling most of the key state organs, including
the judiciary and the military.
</P>
<P>
In the past few months, the conservative judiciary has ordered
the closure of more than 20 reformist papers and journals and
imprisoned many reformist activists on the so-called charges of
violating Islamic values and advocating pro-American reforms.
</P>
<P>
Aware of their weakness, Khatami and his reformist allies have
thus far maintained restraint in face of the conservative
retaliation. They claim that they, too, are loyal to the Islamic
system and all reforms should not conflict with Islamic values and
principles.
</P>
<P>
Khatami has announced that he will seek a second term in next
year's presidential election. With both the reformist and
conservative factions launching their campaign, the 2000 race will
certainly be tougher than that in 1997.

HARARE, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Public Service, Labor

to provide social protection for the informal sector workers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of a three-day workshop on promoting

Zimbabwe, Moyo said there was need for various forms of protection
for this sector as the majority of labor force was moving into it.

"I am aware of the dynamism of the informal sector and the fact
that it is a big constraint if people in this sector are not
recognized to the extent of having an apex body to articulate

</P>
<P>
He said the Ministry of Youth, Gender and Employment Creation
was working with informal sector organizations towards the
formation of such a body.
</P>

<HEADLINE> National Solidarity Fund Better Collected in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A total of 242 billion lei
were collected at the National Solidarity Fund over August 1999-
July 2000, with 214 billion lei in the first seven months of 2000,
informed the Romanian Labor and Social Protection Ministry on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The fund's money is used for programs focused on the social
protection. One of the destinations of the money was a 25 percent
indexation of additional child benefit for families with two or
more children: around 141 billion lei for around 950,000 families.
</P>
<P>
The money was used also for the indexation of grants for
students, coverage of expenditures made by orphanages and old-age
houses. Moreover, the fund granted emergency aids and solidarity
allowances for the poorest families.
</P>
<P>
The Fund, administrated by the Labor Ministry, was set up in
1999 and its main source remains the social stamp on gambling,
worth 5 percent of the price of every participation in TV inter-
active games and 10 percent for the other types of games. Over 500
companies currently operate various types of gambling: casinos,
lotteries, contests on television and pooled wagering on sport.
</P>
<P>
Other source is represented by a 1 percent tax on the value of
imported new vehicles with at least 2,000 cc as well as of the
value of the new house structures on the issuance of the building
license for dwellings with an area of at least 250 sq.m.

<HEADLINE> Top Military Brass to Meet at U.N. on Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Army chiefs from nine
countries that contributed soldiers to the U.N. peacekeeping force
in Sierra Leone will meet at the United Nations headquarters in
New York Wednesday to discuss restructuring and expanding the U.N.
force, a senior U.N. official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The senior official told a press conference that they are
expected to discuss how to make U.N. peacekeeping operations more
effective in the war-torn West African country.
</P>
<P>
Taking part in the Wednesday meeting will be army chiefs of
staff or other senior officers from Bangladesh, Ghana, Guinea,
India, Jordan, Kenya, Nigeria, Russia and Zambia, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
The commander of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone,
Major-General Vijay Jetley of India, and the U.N. special
representative for Sierra Leone, Oluyemi Adeniji of Nigeria, will
also participate in the upcoming meeting.
</P>
<P>
The senior official said that some of the peacekeepers were
still not properly equipped, and the force suffered from a lack of
"team spirit."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone, known as UNAMSIL,
is close to its authorized ceiling of 13,000 soldiers, but Jetley
of India, said early this month that he had asked the U.N.
Security Council for "many more troops" to beef up the U.N.
military presence in Sierra Leone, where the U.N. force suffered
the humiliation of seeing more than 500 of its soldiers taken
hostage by the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF), and they
were released in batches over the following weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council voted unanimously on August 4 to toughen
its mandate and asked U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan for
recommendations for restructuring and strengthening the force.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said "the meeting will also
address the issues of requirements in UNAMSIL as well as
identifying possible means of assistance in this area."
</P>
<P>
Annan is "confident that in addition to reviewing the mission'
s operational aspects, the meeting of the military chiefs will
contribute to strengthening the cohesion and coordination with
UNAMSIL," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is the largest contributor with 882 of its soldiers in
the U.N. force in Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Concludes Sanctions Study in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The report on vulnerability and the humanitarian impact of
United Nations Security Council sanctions against Afghanistan was
released today by the Office of the United Nations Coordinator for
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council imposed sanctions against
the country last fall in an attempt to persuade the Taliban, the
largest warring party in Afghanistan, to hand over Osama bin Laden
whom the United Sates accused of planning the bombing of two U.S.
embassies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that sanctions came on top of a
devastating drought and large-scale population displacement. In
addition, the coping capacity of the civilian population has been
severely weakened as a result of the war and the erosion of many
traditional coping mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the population struggles to survive at near
subsistence levels and many cannot meet their food and non-food
needs, and almost all households without an able-bodied male are
vulnerable and rely on food aid, children's work, and begging to
survive, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that existing sanctions have had both direct
and indirect impact on the population, with the most significant
direct impact on Ariana airlines, the Afghan national carrier.
</P>
<P>
The loss of the air route has meant that sales of fresh fruit
are restricted to the low-priced domestic market, said the report,
and Ariana's reduced income, resulting loss in profitability may
also have an impact on the safety of its domestic operations.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the sanctions have magnified the extent to which
ordinary Afghans feel isolated and victimized, the report added.

The drought, the worst since 1964, has made living conditions

</P>
<P>
With the acute water shortage, the report said, over 60 percent
of the rural population may be forced to migrate to cities.
</P>
<P>
The experts predicted that the situation will worsen by early
2001.
</P>
<P>
The greatest need of the affected population is for drinking
water and livestock and agriculture support, said the report.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Federal Reserve Leaves Key Interest Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve,
amid signs the supercharged economy is finally beginning to slow,
decided Tuesday to leave key interest rates unchanged but said it
remained concerned about inflation in the future.
</P>
<P>
The decision by the Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market
Committee left the benchmark Federal funds target rate on
overnight loans among banks at 6.5 percent and the discount rate
on loans from the Federal Reserve system at 6.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decision was widely expected by economists amid signs of a
slowing economy in recent weeks and the impact of six successive
interest rate hikes since June 1999.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, explaining its decision, the Fed said recent
economic data have indicated that the "expansion of aggregate
demand is moderating toward a pace closer to the rate of growth of
the economy's potential to produce."
</P>
<P>
But the central bank left open the door for future increases,
saying that it believes "the risks continue to be weighted mainly
toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures
in the foreseeable future."
</P>
<P>
Since June 1999, the Fed has raised rates six times in an
effort to slow economic growth enough to keep inflation under
control without retarding the economy so much that it brings about
a recession.
</P>
<P>
In June 1999, before the central bank starting raising rates,
the funds rate stood at 4.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts believe the economy, which grew at a surprisingly
strong 5.2 percent annual rate in the April-June quarter, has
slowed to a growth rate of around 3.5 percent to 4 percent in the
current quarter.
</P>
<P>
The most optimistic economists believe the Fed is close to
declaring total victory in its 14-month campaign to engineer a
soft landing for the economy.
</P>
<P>
But some economists say Fed meetings after the presidential
election on November 15 and December 19 are likely to produce
further interest rate boosts, at one of the two meetings, or
perhaps even both.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Protests KFOR Seizure of Trepca Plant in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia Tuesday lodges
"the strongest protest" against the August 14 "massive armed
attack" and occupation of the Trepca plant in northern Kosovo by
the international peacekeepers, called KFOR, a Yugoslav province
currently under the U.N. administration.
</P>
<P>
The protest came as Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of
the Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations, was making remarks at
a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
The NATO-led KFOR on August 14 forced closure of the Zvecan
smelter furnace in the Trepca metals complex just north of
Mitrovica, touching off clashes between the peacekeepers and local
Serbs. The shutdown was made on the ground that it causes high-
level air pollution.
</P>
<P>
"The Yugoslav Government has denied it," Jovanovic said, "
because the measurement of air pollution which was daily
corresponded to the regulations of the measurement which the
Yugoslav Government has issued some seven years ago."
</P>
<P>
"But even if it was a case, the air pollution was high, it was
not sufficient to justify ... the use of military force because
there are other" ways to check air pollution, he said.
</P>
<P>
The NATO forces dropped "some 30,000 bombs with uranium" in
Kosovo in its air strikes on Yugoslavia from March to June last
year, but the United Nations "never received from NATO detailed
explanation about those bombs, their location, and the degree of
their danger for the population and others," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic also wrote to the president of the U.N. Security
Council to protest the shutdown, saying that the KFOR action
violated its mandate and the Security Council resolution 1244 "in
the most flagrant way so far." The letter is being circulated here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"KFOR used armed force against peaceful employees and the
management of Trepca and the official state representative, as
well as the peaceful Serbian population in that part of the
province," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The attack on and the occupation of Trepca by KFOR
constitutes the most drastic violation of its mandate and the
provision of Security Council resolution 1244 so far," he said. "
This is a unique case of forces acting under a mandate of the
United Nations being massively engaged against a peaceful
population for the protection of which they have been dispatched
by the Security Council and accepted by the government of my
country."
</P>
<P>
The closed-down smelter is part of the Trepca group of 40
mines producing gold, silver, lead and zinc. It is the main source
of employees for local Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jovanovic also accused KFOR for the failure in
sending troops to protect local non-Albanians from terrorist
actions, he said. "It was more than evident that the action
against the Serbian-owned structure, a smelter plant, was aimed at
intimidation and expulsion of the Serbian population, continuation
of the ethnic cleansing of Serbs and other non-Albanians."
</P>
<P>
He said, "6,000 Serbs living there remain jobless as a result
of the military action. They cannot feed their families."

is close to its authorized ceiling of 13,000 soldiers, but Jetley
of India, said early this month that he had asked the U.N.
Security Council for "many more troops" to beef up the U.N.
military presence in Sierra Leone, where the U.N. force suffered
the humiliation of seeing more than 500 of its soldiers taken
hostage by the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF), and they
were released in batches over the following weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council voted unanimously on August 4 to toughen
its mandate and asked U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan for
recommendations for restructuring and strengthening the force.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said "the meeting will also
address the issues of requirements in UNAMSIL as well as
identifying possible means of assistance in this area."
</P>
<P>
Annan is "confident that in addition to reviewing the mission'
s operational aspects, the meeting of the military chiefs will
contribute to strengthening the cohesion and coordination with
UNAMSIL," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is the largest contributor with 3,218 of its soldiers
in the U.N. force in Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Address Arab Foreign Ministers on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is
scheduled to address an Arab foreign ministers meeting in Cairo on
September 3 about the peace talks between the Palestinians and
Israel, Arab League's spokesman Talaat Hamad said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will focus on the latest developments of the Palestinian-
Israeli peace negotiations and his recent efforts to win support
form world countries for the Palestinian cause, Hamad told Egypt's
Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has traveled to 25 capitals in a bid to seek backing for
the Palestinian negotiating position since the Camp David summit
ended in the United States on July 25.
</P>
<P>
The summit failed to produce a final Palestinian-Israeli peace
deal largely due to differences over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Hamad said the question of Jerusalem would feature heavily at
the two-day meeting of the Arab League Foreign Ministers Council,
adding the Palestinian-Israeli dispute over the holy city was at
the core of the conflict in the region.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said on Monday that the
Arab League meeting would also deal with issues concerning the
reactivation of Arab coordination and preparations for a possible
summit.

<HEADLINE> Abdullah Ends Visit to Israel EDS-2nd lead-writethru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's King Abdullah II ended
his short visit to Israel Tuesday afternoon, urging both Israelis
and Palestinians not to miss the chance to end decades of conflict
by reaching a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, who flew to Israel's seaport city of Tel Aviv earlier
in the day from the West Bank city of Ramallah, held talks with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak at the Defense Ministry in the
city.
</P>
<P>
Although no official release about the talks was given, an
Israeli source said the two leaders exchanged views on how to move
the Middle East peace process forward, particularly the issues
concerning the Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah did raise the issues such as the Palestinian refugees
and Jerusalem, which broke down the U.S.-sponsored Camp David
summit in July, the source added.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is the country most intricately linked to the Israeli-
Palestinian peace talks, because it is home to about 1.5 million
Palestinian refugees. Jordan also wants to seek a large
compensation package for hosting these refugees and urges Israel to
allow at least some of the refugees to return.
</P>
<P>
However, the source added, Abdullah neither made any new
specific proposals for their settlement nor suggestions for a
breakthrough of the Israeli-Palestinian track during the talks.
</P>
<P>
He listened carefully to Barak's view on moving the peace
process forward and encouraged Barak to pursue a further round of
talks with Palestinians and Syria, the source added.
</P>
<P>
Before the talks, Abdullah told reporters that to further the
negotiations is the only option for solving the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides are in dialog, and that is a healthy thing when
people are communicating, are trying to overcome the obstacles.
Both sides are committed to moving this process forward and our job
and that of the rest of the international community is to support
our friends in Israel and the Palestinians," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli-Syrian peace track, Abdullah said that Syria's
new President Bashar al-Assad needs time before resuming peace
talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The president is focused on many issues in his country, but as
he said before, the peace process was started by his late father
and is one that he is willing to continue," Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
"We think we just have to give him the time...When he is in a
position or a situation, and this part of the world seems ready...
we hope that he will be ready as a good element in any peace
process," he added.
</P>
<P>
While Barak held talks with Abdullah, Israel's acting Foreign
Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami met with his Jordanian counterpart Abdel
Ilah Khatib in a nearby room, to discuss the ways for further
strengthening the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"Jordan has a very important interest in this peace process and
we are vary happy to include our Jordanian friends in the situation
of the political process, take note of their sensitivities and
concepts, and see to what extent they can help toward progress,"
Ben-Ami told reporters before the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Khatib said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is determined to
achieve progress and work with Barak in order to conclude a peace
agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Also in the Defense Ministry, Regional Cooperation Minister
Shimon Peres hosted delegations of Israeli and Jordanian political
and business leaders.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that at the Defense Ministry, we are
talking not about the military matters, but about cooperations,"
Peres said.
</P>
<P>
In Ramallah, Abdullah held talks with Arafat on the issues of
peace process.
</P>
<P>
This was Abdullah's second visit to Israel. He last visited
Israel's southern Red Sea seaport city of Eilat in April.

<HEADLINE> U.S. "Convert Spy" Pressured to Leave Israel: Attorney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Jeremiah Mattysse, the American
intelligence officer reported missing from his Texas base and was
later found in Israel, left the country Tuesday aboard an Israeli
flight bound for New York.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the U.S. embassy in Israel said that after speaking
by phone with his seniors at the base, Mattysse decided to return
to the United States, Israel Radio reports said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, U.S. ambassador Martin Indyk urged Mattysse, a 50-year-
old Christian-turned Judaist, to fly back to the U.S., saying that
he would be treated fairly.
</P>
<P>
Mattysse was a former commander in a U.S. army unit that trained
intelligence experts and he reportedly had access to classified
information of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
</P>
<P>
Israeli police spokesman was also quoted by Israel Radio as
saying that the officer in question had left "on his own free will"
in order to sort out his affair in the U.S. and then come back to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the official claims, Mattysse's attorney Yoram
Sheftel held that the officer had left under strong pressure.
</P>
<P>
"He was kidnapped by the police," Sheftel told the Internet
edition of the leading Israeli daily The Jerusalem Post.
</P>
<P>
Mattysse has filed an application for Israeli immigrant status
with the Israeli Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Sheftel said it makes no sense that only five or six days after
applying for Israeli citizenship, Mattysse would get up and leave
the country willingly.
</P>
<P>
The attorney said Mattysse was detained Monday evening at a
youth hostel in Mitzpe Ramon in the southern desert area of Negev
and was interrogated until after midnight.
</P>
<P>
When he left the international crimes unit of the police in
Petah Tikva near the coastal city of Tel Aviv, he was in good
spirit and smiled in front of reporters, Sheftel said.
</P>
<P>
During the interrogation he was forced to meet with an unknown
official from the U.S. embassy and kept away from all reporters and
was not permitted to meet with his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
Mattysse was kept in detention for the legal six hours and then
released, but five hours later he disappeared and was brought back
to the serious crimes department of the police for further
interrogation.
</P>
<P>
At that point, it seemed that he broke down and was quickly sent
in an unmarked civilian vehicle with plainclothes escorts to Ben-
Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv where he was placed on a plane to the U.
S., Sheftel said.
</P>
<P>
Sheftel said it is absurd to say that Mattysse left willingly.
He believed that Mattysse will be tried in a U.S. military court
for desertion and may be sentenced to a number of years in prison.
He is not suspected of passing classified information or spying for
Israel, Sheftel added.
</P>
<P>
Mattysse disappeared on August 7 and then mysteriously turned up
in Israel. He was said to have made his way into the country via
Cyprus under a fake passport.
</P>
<P>
The United States asked Israel to help search for him after his
Israeli girlfriend, Rivka Nir, confirmed his arrival in Israel. It
was also Nir who tipped off the Israeli police about his
whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
The woman also claimed that Mattysse had come to Israel with
secret documents.
</P>
<P>
Mattysse has dissociated himself from Nir, saying that the
statements she made about him were false.
</P>
<P>
"I am not a spy. I never passed on any classified information,"
Mattysse earlier told reporters.

<P>
CAIRO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Nine people were killed and six
others seriously injured on Tuesday in a road accident in southern
Egypt, the country's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The accident took place when a minibus crashed head-on into a
small truck on a highway in the governorate of Minya, 220
kilometers south of Cairo, the news agency quoted an official at
the Interior Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
A 22-year-old soldier, a teacher and five peasants aged between
40 and 60 were among the dead along with the two drivers, when the
small bus tried to overtake a car ahead of it, the official said on
customary condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Traffic accidents are common in Egypt, where local newspapers
dub rural highways "roads of death," largely because of reckless
driving. Official figures show that about 3,000 people die in road
accidents each year in Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Obasanjo Pledges to Improve Living Standard of Nigerians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo pledged on Tuesday to improve the living standard of his
fellow countrymen by building a strong, broad-based economy.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the presentation of a handbook, "Obasanjo's
Economic Direction: 1999-2003" on Tuesday in the capital Abuja,
Obasanjo, who was represented by secretary of the federal
government Obong Ufot Ekaette, said the objective of his economic
policy "is to ensure that there is food on every table, as well as
access to basic infrastructure and services, which will transform
Nigeria into a happy society".
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo said the objectives outlined in the handbook were
achievable, given the abundance of human and material resources of
the country.
</P>
<P>
However, Obasanjo appealed to Nigerians to embrace the
atmosphere of tolerance, of give-and-take, brotherliness and good
neighborliness, adding that the objectives would not be achieved
if everyone took up arms against each other.
</P>
<P>
"As a nation of diversity, tolerance and dialogue are the only
hope for survival," added the president.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Earns Another 452 Million Dollars in U.N."Oil-for-Food" Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraq exported 17.5
million barrels of oil last week, earning an additional 452
million U.S. dollars for the United Nations humanitarian "oil-for-
food" program, the latest figures from the United Nations Office
of Iraq Program said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The office, which administers the U.N. humanitarian "oil-for-
food" program, reported that the Security Council Committee
monitoring the sanctions against Iraq approved another two
contracts last week for the sale of Iraqi oil.
</P>
<P>
The office said the committee has approved 97 contracts since
the current phase of the program began on June 9, with a total of
nearly 383 barrels.
</P>
<P>
Over the same period, Iraq has exported oil worth more than 3.4
billion dollars, it added.
</P>
<P>
Under the Security Council resolution establishing the "oil-for-
food program," 66 percent of the earning goes to fund the country'
s humanitarian needs and 30 percent is directed to the
Compensation Commission which pays claims arising from Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait. The remainder goes to pay the costs of the U.N.
Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission and U.N.
operational costs.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions against Iraq cannot be lifted until the United
Nations clarifies that Iraq has destroyed all its weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. arms inspectors have been away from Iraq since the U.
S.-led military air strikes against the country in December 1998.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Religions Enter "Golden Age": Bishop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Bishop of the Chinese
Catholic Church Michael Fu Tieshan said on Tuesday in an speech
delivered at the University of California at Los Angeles that
Chinese religions are entering a "Golden Age."
</P>
<P>
"All of the happy fruits (in China) could not be separated
from the 5,000-year Chinese tradition that values harmony and
forgiveness as the most precious, as well as the policy of
separation between politics and religion and freedom of belief,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Fu, chairman of the China Catholicism Association, is heading
the visiting Chinese religious leaders delegation to attend the
Millenium World Peace Summit of religious and spiritual leaders,
which is to be held in the United Nations headquarters later this
month.
</P>
<P>
It is provided for by law that Chinese citizens may freely
choose and express their religious beliefs and make clear their
religious affiliations, Fu told the meeting of 100 religious
leaders in California and scholars.
</P>
<P>
According to the Bishop, there are more than 100 million
religious followers in China, more than 85,000 places of worship
and 3,000 religious communities with 30,000 clergy to serve
spiritual needs of their followers.
</P>
<P>
Of the top five religions, Buddhism, the most influential, has
a history of 2,000 years in China, Taoism, native to the country,
has a history of more than 1,700 years. Islam was introduced to
China in the seventh century. Catholicism and Protestantism boomed
in China with the humiliating Opium War in the 1840s, but they
still have 4 million and 10 million followers in China today.
</P>
<P>
"Religious organizations in China run their own affairs
independently and set up religious schools, publish religious
classics and periodicals and run social services according to
their will," he said.
</P>
<P>
"All clerical and worshipping activities conducted in
accordance with law, in public or at home, such as worshipping the
Buddha, reciting scriptures, going to church, praying, preaching,
observing Mass, baptizing, monkhood initiation, fasting
celebrating religious festivals, are not be interfered with by
outsiders," said the Bishop.
</P>
<P>
He said that all religions are equal in status in China and
religious wars, which have plagued many parts of the world, are
unknown in China.
</P>
<P>
"Religious believers and non-believers respect each other, are
united and have a harmonious relationship," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese religions are also getting themselves involved in
participating in politics, just as other members of the society,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics show that 17,000 Catholics are members
of their local government political consultative conference and
people's congresses.
</P>
<P>
With suggestions and proposals absorbed into national or local
laws and policies, Chinese religious groups are becoming an active
element in the society, he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, religious believers are increasing dramatically,
for instance, the number of new Protestants today is 10 times more
than that in 1949, the Bishop said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Bishop Has Mixed Feelings toward Rapid Rise of Religious Adherents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese religious
population has witnessed a sharp increase over the years, but
Michael Fu Tieshan, bishop of the Chinese Catholic Council, still
said here Tuesday that he has mixed feelings, because the ill-
educated are always prone to fall pray to cults and heresies.
</P>
<P>
Fu, chairman of the visiting Chinese delegation of religious
leaders, made the remark at a forum held at the University of
California at Los Angeles, attended by 100 local religious leaders
and scholars.
</P>
<P>
He didn't provide an exact overall numbers of how fast the
increase of religious followers in China is, but cited the case of
Protestant churches saying that it has followers 10 times more
than in 1949.
</P>
<P>
"In the mere view of religion, the increase of adherents is
truly encouraging, but it also poses as a major challenge for us
when the educational background of the followers are considered,"
Fu said.
</P>
<P>
A considerable amount of the religious believers are women,
seniors and people ill-educated, who hardly have any chance to
distinguish religion from heretic teachings, he said.
</P>
<P>
The increased followers are more than the existing Chinese
clergymen can handle, because there own proficiency level also
needs to be updated and improved, according to the bishop.
</P>
<P>
The diversified economic and cultural developments inside
China and influences from the outside world are also affecting the
legitimate religions, some spiritual polluters like cults are
highly probable to invade the virgin land of this country.
</P>
<P>
According to Fu, all the religions in China, Buddhism, Taoism,
Islamism, Protestantism and Catholicism, are busying re-editing
their theology to better adapt to the society and training more
their young clergymen.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed that all religions in China as well as across
the world to guard against heresies and cults for the healthy
development of legitimate religions.

<HEADLINE> Number of Swiss Using Internet on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The number of people in the
German-speaking part of Switzerland using the Internet has
increased sharply, according to a new survey published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey estimates that around 1.65 million people in the
German-speaking part of Switzerland use the Internet daily, either
for work or private purposes, or both. Eighty-five percent of the
whole country's 7.1 million population speak German.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the Internet users in the German-speaking
part have done on-line shopping. The survey found that there was a
10 percent increase over the past year in the number of on-line
purchases, with 90,000 people confident enough to click their way
through cyber-shopping aisles.
</P>
<P>
Over half of all items bought via the Internet are books. The
second most popular items are CDs, accounting for 43 percent of on-
line sales. The Internet is also a popular tool for making hotel
reservations, which account for 27 percent of all on-line
financial transactions.
</P>
<P>
While Internet-usage is gaining ground, one fifth of all German-
speaking Swiss profess to have no interest in e-commerce,
according to the survey. Around 760,000 Internet-users have never
bought anything over the web, and half of those say they never
will. However, some 42 percent of them said they expected to buy
something on-line within a year.
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of the Internet users surveyed said they had no
problem communicating their personal data over the web to a
company they deemed reputable.
</P>
<P>
Search engines also proved popular, with 86 percent of Internet-
users saying that they use these sites regularly. Electronic mail
is also very popular. Ninety-six percent of cyber-surfers use the
E-mail service.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Supreme Court Urged to Let Appeals Court Hear Antitrust Case First </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp. has renewed
its argument that the U.S. Supreme Court should let a federal
appeals court to hear first the historic antitrust case that
threatens to split the computer software giant into two.
</P>
<P>
"The benefits of comprehensive review by the court of appeals
far outweigh whatever time, if any, might be saved by direct
review in this court," Microsoft's lawyers said in a brief filed
Monday with the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The company's brief denied as "unfounded" the Justice
Department's contention that Microsoft is seeking initial review
in a federal appeals court in an effort to delay final resolution
of the case.
</P>
<P>
"No one is more anxious than Microsoft to see this case brought
to a prompt conclusion," the 10-page brief said.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft filed its Supreme Court appeal July 26, seeking to
overturn U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's ruling that
it engaged in illegally anticompetitive conduct. That appeal urged
the nation's highest court to "avoid the onerous task of sifting
through a large and complex record and forgoing the many benefits
of intermediate appellate review."
</P>
<P>
In a response filed August 15, Justice Department lawyers said
sending the case to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia would result in a delay that "could
irreparably harm competition in a vital and rapidly evolving
sector of the national economy."
</P>
<P>
Jackson ruled in April that Microsoft had engaged in illegal
anticompetitive conduct to maintain its monopoly over the
operating systems that run personal computers.
</P>
<P>
He ordered June 7 the company to split itself into two
companies. One would sell Windows, the operating system that runs
most of the world's personal computers. The other would sell
everything else the company produces, such as its Internet
services and its lucrative Office software suite, which includes
popular word processing and spreadsheet programs.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft wants its appeal heard first in the Court of Appeals
because that court has reversed Jackson's decisions on Microsoft-
related matters twice in the past. The Justice Department, on the
other hand, wants to avoid the Court of Appeals for the same
reason.
</P>
<P>
While Jackson's June ruling would require Microsoft's breakup,
the judge has delayed any enforcement of his order pending the
company's appeal.
</P>
<P>
A federal law allows major antitrust disputes to skip the
appeals court step and move from a trial court to the Supreme
Court, but the justices make the decision.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> EU Asks OPEC to Produce More Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Union on Tuesday
asked the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to
increase production of oil so as to bring down the price.
</P>
<P>
A European Commission spokesman told the press that Loyola de
Palacio, EU energy commissioner, had telephoned OPEC President Ali
Rodriguez to ask the Venezuelan oil minister to try to bring down
the oil price.
</P>
<P>
The Central American country is now holding the rotating
presidency of the OPEC that has a quota system for oil production
for its member countries.
</P>
<P>
"The EU asked Venezuela to try and moderate their stance on the
oil price and to have a more reasonable price," said the spokesman,
who added that the 15-nation European bloc would like to see the
price of crude oil at around 25 U.S. dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil has been trading of late at a 10-year high of close
to 30 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for the commission, the executive body of the
European Union, said that the union was working with the United
States to coordinate efforts aimed at bringing down the price of
crude oil on the international market.

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Court to Demand More CIA Information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Judges at the
Lockerbie trial that resumed on Tuesday demanded the United States
intelligence service to reveal more information.
</P>
<P>
Presiding Judge Lord Ranald lain Sutherland said that chief
prosecutor Colin Boyd must encourage the U.S. secret service to
release potentially relevant cable communications from its agents.
</P>
<P>
Cable communications from American secret service agents in
Malta to Washington were challenged on Tuesday at the Lockerbie
trial as it resumed after a three-week summer recess.
</P>
<P>
The defense team asked the prosecution to provide cable
communications in their entity as it argued that the version sent
to the defense team had been edited with sections and words
blanked out.
</P>
<P>
Defense Counsel William Taylor told the Scottish court on Dutch
soil that he had been informed that the cables, between United
States security service agents in Malta and Washington after
interviews with a Libyan defector, had been edited because they
contained sensitive or irrelevant information.
</P>
<P>
"I emphatically do not accept that what lies behind the blanked-
out sections is of no relevance to a cross-examiner," said Taylor.
</P>
<P>
The cables are introduced by the prosecution to serve as key
evidence in its case against Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and Al-Amin
Khalifa Fahima who are accused of planting a bomb on board of Pan
Am Flight 103.
</P>
<P>
The mid-air explosion on board Pan Am Flight 103 on December 21,
1988, killed 259 people on the New York-bound airliner and 11
others on the ground in the Scottish town of Lockerbie.
</P>
<P>
The cables contained information about the interviews with
Abdul Majid Giaka, a Libyan secret agent who defected shortly
before the Lockerbie bombing.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan defector was scheduled to appear in court to testify
behind a screen with his voice disguised about what he knows about
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have planned to introduce a batch of cable
communications that combined with the appearance of Giaka in court
is expected to serve as key evidence in the case against the two
Libyan suspects.
</P>
<P>
The Lockerbie trial, that took almost 12 years to investigate
and prepare, finally went underway on May 3 this year and is now
expected to last up to a year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Thanks Swiss Counterpart for Holocaust Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- United States President Bill
Clinton has thanked his Swiss counterpart Adolf Ogi for helping to
resolve claims relating to Holocaust era assets in Swiss banks,
according to a Swiss Radio International report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed on August 9 to the Swiss president
Clinton praised Swiss banks for compensating Holocaust victims and
their heirs. "With your support, we have reached a historic point
in the Holocaust assets issue," Clinton told Ogi in the letter.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that Clinton's letter may signal an end to the
strained relations between Berne and Washington over the issue of
dormant Holocaust-era accounts in Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
The letter comes after US district judge, Edward Korman,
approved a 1.25-billion-U.S. dollar settlement between Switzerland
's two biggest banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, and Jewish
organizations over missing assets from the Nazi era. Under the
terms of the settlement, the two Swiss banks will not be liable
for any future claims over dormant accounts.
</P>
<P>
The settlement is compensation for assets that Jews deposited
in Switzerland during the Nazi era. After the Second World War,
many of the account holders have complained that they were unable
to claim their assets. Nearly 600,000 people have said they are
considering making claims for money from the settlement.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Boxer Dreams of Gold in Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 22 (Xinhua) -- George Odindo, Kenya's light-
heavyweight boxer, wants to emulate the late Robert Wangila by
bringing home a gold medal from Sydney, local media reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wangila was the first Kenyan and African to ever win an Olympic
boxing gold medal during the 1988 Seoul Games. Odindo said it was
Wangila's gold that inspired his boxing career.
</P>
<P>
Odindo, the captain of Kenya's four-member boxing team for the
forthcoming Olympic Games in Sydney, said in a recent interview
that "I want to win a gold medal in Sydney and dedicate it to my
parents and son, Reagan. I am tired of living in the shadows of
Cuban and Russian boxers."
</P>
<P>
Just before he flew out to Adelaide, Australia, for
acclimatization, Odindo reiterated that he and his colleagues
would go flat out to restore the country's glory.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Odindo and his twin brother, Samuel Opiyo (
heavyweight), donned national team colors for the first time in
1997 after winning the Kenya Open Championships in the capital
Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
He won a light-heavyweight gold medal during the Africa Zone
Five Championships in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, in April this year,
and grabbed another in the Kabaka Mutebi International Tournament
in Kampala, Uganda, in July this year.

<HEADLINE> India, Japan to Promote Economic Relations By Bai Jingshan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 22 (Xinhua) -- India and Japan are all set to
embark on a new and closer economic relationship with the visit by
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori indicating that he would
present a package during his talks Wednesday with Indian leaders.
</P>
<P>
Mori, who arrived here Tuesday evening for a three-day official
visit from Bangalore, 2000 kilometers south of here, is scheduled
to hold wide-ranging talks with his Indian counterpart Atal Biheri
Vajpayee on regional, international and issues of mutual concern,
Indian Foreign Secretary Lalit Mansingh said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The visit, the first by a Japanese Prime Minister in the last
ten year, highlighted that Tokyo is keen to bring back on track
bilateral relations derailed in the aftermath of India's nuclear
tests in May, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure to New Delhi, the Japanese leader, who
arrived in Bangalore Monday evening from Pakistan, reportedly
proposed a major promotion and cooperation initiative between the
two countries in information technology (IT) sector.
</P>
<P>
Addressing captains of Indian industry and trade in the
southern Indian city, Mori said the initiative would include
training program for 1,000 Indian engineers in Japanese business
practices and language and an Indo-Japan IT summit.
</P>
<P>
A large scale economic mission and a mission of Japanese small
and medium scale enterprises would visit the South Asian country
in October and next January to trigger "active inter-changes" with
promising IT companies, Mori added.
</P>
<P>
Mori said his government was about to launch an "expansive
measure" on the issuance of multiple entry visas for short-stay
visits in Japan from India for business purposes.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese leader spoke of India's high software technology,
saying extraordinary strong complementary relations existed
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He told the Indian industrial leaders that the current
cooperation between the two countries in the IT field still
remained low profile compared to its potential, adding that he
would like to show Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee the proposed IT
promotion and cooperation exchange.
</P>
<P>
Japan is a major source of development assistance and leading
trade partner and investor in India, with the two-way trade
increasing to 4.56 billion U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Japan imposed strict economic sanctions against New Delhi
immediately after India's nuclear tests in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure to India, Mori appealed to India and
neighboring Pakistan to sigh the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (
CTBT) to establish peace in South Asia as a precondition to lift
the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
However, a high-ranking Indian official said on Monday that
there was no linkage between lifting of the economic sanctions and
the signing of CTBT by New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Mori flew in Bangalore from Islamabad after his day-long trip
to Pakistan as part of his four-nation tour which includes
Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and Nepal.

MOSCOW, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chechen Election Commission
announced Tuesday that retired General Aslanbek Aslakhanov has
been elected deputy of the Russian State Duma (lower house of
parliament), according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Aslakhanov, president of the Association of Law Enforcement
Officers of Russia, received 31 percent of the votes, leading his
strongest rival Adam Deniyev, leader of the Humanity movement, who
received 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 percent of registered voters came to polling stations
during Sunday's elections, the Chechen Election Committee Chief
Kerim Arsakhanov said.
</P>
<P>
The elections in Chechnya demonstrate a renewal of the
political situation in the republic, said Viktor Kazantsev,
Russian presidential representative in the southern federal
district.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the elections have taken place indicates a new
turn in developments in Chechnya. Regardless of the threats made
by rebels, or the attempted bribery and intimidation of electoral
commission members and ordinary people, more than 50 percent of
the voters participated in the polls," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The election displays a new distribution of forces in Chechnya,
" he added.
</P>

With the election of Aslakhanov into the Duma, the Chechens
have chosen to live within Russia and by Russian laws, Kazantsev
said.

<HEADLINE> Norwegians Leave Submarine, Russians Vow to Continue Search </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Moscow on Tuesday vowed to carry
on the search of the sunken nuclear submarine "Kursk," despite the
fact that Norwegian divers who participated in the previous
investigation have left the disaster area.
</P>
<P>
A correspondent from the Russian RTR, the only television
company allowed by the Russian navy to work aboard the cruiser "
Pyotr Velikiy" (the Great Peter) in the disaster area and report
on the rescue operations, said the Norwegian decision to leave
stems from the fact that their contract has ended.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian divers arrived to help save the crew, but they cannot
get involved in a search for the dead. They reportedly do not
have a license for this, and it requires very thorough
preparations, the correspondent explained. He added that it is
not known how the situation will develop in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
Russia had earlier been expected to make arrangements with the
Norwegian deep-sea divers to recover the dead 118-member crew. "
The Russian side has taken on commitments to conclude a contract
and pay the expenses for doing this hazardous work," Russia's
Northern Fleet Chief of Staff Mikhail Motsak told the RTR.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the General Staff Admiral Viktor Kravchenko told
Interfax that the navy's supreme commander has ordered the search
to continue until the last seaman's body is recovered from the
submarine.
</P>
<P>
"This order will unquestionably be carried out," and "any
difficulties will be overcome," Kravchenko pledged, adding that "
the Northern Fleet's rescue forces and equipment are still working
in the area."

<HEADLINE> South Korean Economy Grows 9.6 Percent in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean economy grew 9.6
percent in the second quarter of this year compared with the same
period last year, the Bank of Korea said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed the growth to increased facility
investments and export.
</P>
<P>
Facility investment rose 41.3 percent, and consumption in the
private sector climbed 9 percent while merchandise exports soared
23.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, domestic and overseas demand for industrial
machinery, computers and semiconductors was brisk, leading to a 16.
8 percent growth in manufacturing sector output.
</P>
<P>
However, the consumption and construction investments were
comparatively small. The bank ruled out concern over excessive
consumption.
</P>
<P>
Concerns over the economy have been widespread due to financial
market jitters caused by a credit crunch.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth clearly indicates that the economy has been
functioning well, said a bank spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Chechnya Elects New Russian State Duma Deputy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chechen Election Commission
announced Tuesday that retired General Aslanbek Aslakhanov has won
a seat in the Russian State Duma, the lower house of parliament,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Aslakhanov, president of the Association of Law Enforcement
Officers of Russia, received 31 percent of the votes, leading his
closest rival, Adam Deniyev, leader of Humanity movement, by 12
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The republic's administration head Akhmad Kadyrov
congratulated the winner and said the next stage election for the
administration head should be held no later than a year from now.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 percent of registered voters came to polling stations
for Sunday's elections, the Chechen Election Committee Chief Kerim
Arsakhanov said.
</P>
<P>
The elections in Chechnya demonstrate a renewal of the
political situation in the republic, Viktor Kazantsev, Russian
presidential representative in the southern federal district, said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the elections have taken place indicates that a
new turn has taken place in the developments in Chechnya.
Regardless of the threats made by rebels, the attempted bribery
and intimidation of electoral commission members and ordinary
people, more than 50 percent of the voters participated in the
polls," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The elections display a new distribution of forces in
Chechnya," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Bearing in mind that the administration led by Akhmad Kadyrov
has come to exist, and the population of Chechnya now has a
representative in the federal legislature, it can be said that
residents of the republic have chosen to live within Russia and by
Russian laws," Kazantsev said.
</P>
<P>
The voting began at 8 a.m. Moscow time (0400 GMT) Sunday in
all of Chechnya's 19 electoral districts, including the Shatoi,
Sharoi, Itum-Kale and Vedeno mountain districts.
</P>
<P>
There were 495,000 people registered as official voters.
Thirteen candidates ran for the parliament seat, among them
Aslakhanov, Deniyev, leader of the local branch of the Unity
movement Lecha Magamadov and former Chechen parliamentary Chairman
Amin Osmayev.
</P>
<P>
Unprecedented measures to prevent terrorist attacks were in
place. Following a recent series of attacks against polling
stations, road traffic has been restricted. The authorities have
urged citizens to refrain from traveling outside their immediate
areas.
</P>
<P>
The elections were declared valid as voter turnout surpassed
25 percent, which is needed by law.

<HEADLINE> Romanian, Hungarian Researchers Find Remedy Against Cancer: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A group of Romanian and
Hungarian researchers have discovered a remedy against certain
types of cancer, based on light water, the local daily newspaper
Curentul reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Light water is a secondary product obtained after removal of
tritium from heavy water.
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that the water of the human tissues
affected by malignant tumors have very high levels of deuterium.
By implementing the reverse process, the researchers gave patients
light water and pharmaceutical compounds made from it.
</P>
<P>
Results were impressive, with tumors not only being stopped,
but also cured, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Researchers of the National Development Institute for Cryogenic
and Isotopic Technologies based in Ramnicu Valcea of central
Romania, along with a team of Hungarian researchers, have obtained
a license for the product, which has already been sold and used
successfully, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Ramnicu Valcea Institute is one of only four research
centers worldwide that deal in recovering tritium from heavy water.
It produces light water in large amounts, at prices lower than the
other three institutes.
</P>
<P>
After forging an agreement with the Hungarian side, the Ramnicu
Valcea Institute grossed more than 700 million U.S. dollars from
exports of light water alone in nearly one year.
</P>
<P>
At last year's invention shows in Brussels and Geneva, the
institute was awarded 17 medals, including seven golds.

which was climaxed in 1994 by the signing of the peace treaty
between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
The king's visit came at a time when Israel's peace negotiations
with the Palestinians are at a critical stage and will no doubt
help move this peace process forward, he said.
</P>
<P>
Barak promised that his government is determined to continue to
seek peace in the Middle East, particularly with all of Israel's
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks, Barak
said it is time for both the Israeli and Palestinian leaders to
make "painful decisions" so that a peace agreement can be reached.
</P>
<P>
Barak urged Abdullah to play a greater role in helping Israel
reach peace agreements with the Palestinians and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said Jordan is committed to helping realize peace in
the region and will continue to help the parties concerned find
reasonable solutions to the Middle East problems.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian people have been fighting for their fundamental
rights for a long time and such rights should be recognized in
settling the Israeli-Palestinian issue, the king added.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Israel to continue its efforts to reach peace with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
This was the second meeting between Abdullah and Barak in about
a week. After the welcoming ceremony, Abdullah and Barak were
driven to the Defense Ministry in the city for a working meeting.
</P>
<P>
On the way, Abdullah stopped at the Rabin Square to lay a wreath
at the site of the assassination of late Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin. The late premier was shot and killed in 1995 by a Jewish
extremist who opposed his peace policies.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah last visited Israel in April in the southern Red Sea
port city of Eilat.

<HEADLINE> Manila Claims to Continue Peace Talks with MILF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Peace talks will continue between
the Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front
MILF) panels the chief government negotiator said in Mindandao on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Edgardo Batenga, government chief negotiator made the
announcement in a radio interview in Cotabato city of Maguindanao
province following the decision by the MILF central committee to
stop its peace negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Batenga said he is hopeful that through back channel
communications, he could still convince the MILF panels to return
to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
He, however, clarified that despite the disbandment of the MILF
peace panel, the plan of the government would remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The other day, Al Haj Murad, MILF vice chairman for military
affairs, announced in a press statement that the central committee
has decommissioned the MILF peace panel and all its staff members.
</P>
<P>
The recall of authority, according to Murad, was issued by MILF
Chairman Hashim Salamat on August 14 in what they see as the
government's "insincerity" in pursuing a peaceful resolution of
the armed conflict in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Salamat, according to Murad, described as "absurd" the
government preconditions on the resumption of talks and the bounty
offered for the arrest of top MILF leaders.
</P>
<P>
"The central committee," Murad said, "could not tolerate
risking the safety of the MILF panel members, advisers,
consultants, staff members and the working groups in the face of
the arrest warrants."
</P>
<P>
As a "goodwill" gesture, however, President Joseph Estrada has
ordered Interior Secretary Alfredo Lim the other day to withdraw
the bounty offered for the arrest of Salamat, Murad, and MILF
spokesman Eid Kabalu.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Calls for Addressing Trade Imbalance with India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abdus
Samad Azad Tuesday said while inaugurating an Indian Textile
Exhibition that Bangladesh-India trade interdependence should be
picked up, but by addressing the growing trade imbalance
objectively.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said India has emerged as the single
largest source of imports for Bangladesh in recent years.
Bangladesh imports goods worth over one billion U.S. dollars from
India annually against its exports worth around 60 million dollars,
showing a huge trade imbalance.
</P>
<P>
"For a viable economic relation, it's important to address this
issue objectively and in the spirit of friendship and
understanding," Azad said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said economic interactions between the two
countries should be balanced, comprehensive and mutually-
beneficial so that both can gain much from cooperation and
collective efforts.
</P>
<P>
He invited the Indian businessmen and industrial entrepreneurs
to seize upon the opportunity provided to foreign investors by
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
"I believe, their support would not only help bring some
balance in our bilateral trade, it would also stimulate growth in
Bangladesh," Azad said.
</P>
<P>
The three-day exhibition called ITEXPO 2000 was organized by
the Synthetic &AMP; Rayon Textiles Export Promotion Council of India
in collaboration with the Indian High Commission in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
Over 30 Indian textile companies, including some of the biggest
and well-known ones, put on display an array of latest synthetic,
rayon and blended textiles.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Money Changers Suggest Auction Sale of Foreign Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi money changers Tuesday
suggested reintroduction of "auction sale" of foreign currency to
check underground transfer and encourage official inflow of
foreign remittance to raise the country's poor foreign exchange
reserve.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's Foreign exchange reserve was 2.03 billion U.S.
dollars when the present government assumed power in 1996, then it
came down to 1.62 billion dollars in May this year and 1.4 billion
by now, Bangladesh Money Changers Association (BMCA) president
Kefayet Ullah Masud told a press conference here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Reintroduction of auction system remains the only option to
raise the foreign exchange reserve to a safe level, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Masud said foreign currencies remitted by non-resident
Bangladeshis (NRBs were sold in open auction at competitive prices,
which encouraged them to remit money only through the official
channel till June, 1984.
</P>
<P>
The then government later stopped the system and introduced
bank-fixed exchange rates, encouraging underground transaction
which offers NRBs better rates and now controls 70 to 80 percent
inflow of foreign remittance, he said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign remittance inflow in the 1999-2000 fiscal year amounted
to about 1.9 billion dollars, of which 40 to 45 percent came from
Saudi Arabia alone, he informed.
</P>
<P>
Frequent devaluation would never help increase inward
remittance through official channel, as underground traders always
offer higher rate than the official one, Masud said, decrying the
government's logic that devaluation would help increase foreign
exchange reserve.
</P>
<P>
The government recently announced the devaluation of the
currency by 6 percent to 54 taka against one dollar, aiming to
remain competitive in the world market and increase foreign
exchange reserve.

<HEADLINE> No Recovery of "Kursk" Expected Before Autumn of 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The sunken Russian nuclear
submarine "Kursk" cannot be raised from the Barents Sea floor
before autumn of next year, a senior Russian naval officer said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It will take at least three or four months to recover the
submarine if the work begins in May," Admiral Eduard Baltin, a
former commander of Russia's Black Sea Fleet said in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Regarding statements by the general contractor from the Rubin
Design Bureau, which claimed the Kursk could be brought up by the
beginning of winter, Baltin said it's "a theory, not a
practicality."
</P>
<P>
To place a sling under the submarine requires at least three
trenches being dug under it, the admiral said. According to his
experience, strong currents, which could reach 2.5 knots in the
area, would destroy the trenches. High-pressure equipment would
have to be in use constantly to support them.

<P>
TOKYO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese Football Association
(JFA) has invited FIFA president Sepp Blatter to Tokyo to discuss
next year's Confederations Cup following an apology from world
soccer's governing body over its proposal for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
JFA president Shun-ichiro Okano said there was still a
possibility Japan might co-host the event with South Korea next
summer as a trial run for the 2002 World Cup, which would be in
line with FIFA's wishes.
</P>
<P>
His comments came after Blatter sent a letter apologising for
FIFA's handling of the matter before a FIFA congress in Zurich
last month.
</P>
<P>
FIFA were hoping that Japan and South Korea could stage the
Confederations Cup next June as a dress rehearsal for 2002, with
teams and fans swapping countries and new stadiums staging
international games.
</P>
<P>
Okano now hopes Blatter can stop in Tokyo and attend Japan's
friendly match against Morocco on September 5 before going to
Sydney for the Olympic soccer tournament. If Blatter cannot make
it, Okano will have talks with Blatter at Sydney.

<HEADLINE> Biodiversity Farming Helps China Combat Rice Blast, Up Yields (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The results of Chinese field
trials have reinforced the accepted scientific wisdom that
planting different varieties of a crop in the same field
suppresses the spread of certain diseases and improves yields.
</P>
<P>
Li Yan, one of the researchers in the program, said today in a
telephone interview with Xinhua that the large-scale experiments
conducted during 1998 and 1999 are unprecedented in the world.
</P>
<P>
Headed by Professor Zhu Youyong, a plant pathologist at the
Phytopathology Laboratory at Yunnan Agricultural University in
Kunming, southwest China, a research team found an 18 percent rise
in overall productivity, including greater profits for a premium-
priced variety that is particularly susceptible to rice blast from
a fungus.
</P>
<P>
The experiments involved mixing two varieties of rice in the
same field at 10 townships in the province, covering 4,000 ha.
</P>
<P>
Farmers planted a single row of glutinous rice in the middle
of a group of either four or six rows of hybrid rice. The
experiment started on 812 ha in 1998 and expanded to 3,342 ha in
1999. Monoculture control plots were grown at 15 small sites
throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
According to the results, it would take an average of 1.18
hectares of monoculture cropland to produce the same amounts of
hybrid and glutinous rice produced in one hectare of mixed crops.
</P>
<P>
The most striking change was for individual glutinous plants
grown in a mixed environment. They yielded up to 89 percent more
rice than their monocultural cousins.
</P>
<P>
Li said as the glutinous rice fetches at a premium price, the
value per hectare of the mixed fields was 14 percent greater than
the hybrid monoculture plots and 40 percent greater than the
glutinous monoculture plots.
</P>
<P>
In both years, blast destroyed about 20 percent of the
glutinous rice grain in the monoculture plots but only one percent
in the mixed plots. Blast damage in the hybrid rice, although much
lower in general, also dropped, with a grain loss of only one
percent in the mixed plots as opposed to 2.3 percent in
monoculture plots.

<HEADLINE> NW City Boosts Cultural Relics Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TURPAN (XINJIANG), August 22 (Xinhua) -- An important city on
the world famous "Silk Road", Turpan is making efforts to further
improve the protection of its cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
The city of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
has five key cultural relic sites at the country level and other
23 sites at the provincial level, including the Thousand-Buddha
Grottoes, the Astana Ancient Tombs and the Jiaohe Ancient City
Ruins.
</P>
<P>
The local bureau of cultural relics has invested 400,000 yuan
to build a 150-meter-long anti-flood facility along the Jiaohe
ruins, which are only 30 meters away from a river.
</P>
<P>
Safety devices such as aluminum alloy doors and vitreous
balusters are set up in the Thousand-Buddha Grottoes and other
cultural relics to better protect the grottoes and the valuable
frescoes.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the city invested over two million yuan in 1,
000-square-meter hall of huge rhinoceros fossils in the Turpan
Museum.
</P>
<P>
Turpan Basin, a desert area in northwest China, is deemed by
some as "the world's richest open archeological museum". Almost 80
per cent of the cultural relics in the region's museums came from
Turpan.
</P>
<P>
Turpan's rich cultural heritage has attract tourists to the
small city, said Yue Feng, director of the Xinjiang Cultural
Relics Administration.
</P>
<P>
Over 500,000 domestic and foreign tourists visited the city
last year, according to local statistics.

<HEADLINE> Biodiversity Farming Helps China Combat Rice Blast, Up Yields (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 40,000 ha of farmland was planted in this mixing pattern
in the prefectures of Honghe and Xishuangbanna in the province,
said Li.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan plans to expand the acreage to 70,000 ha next year, and
nine provincial areas in China, the country's major rice-producing
areas, also plan to introduce the technique following satisfactory
experiments of their own, said Li.
</P>
<P>
He said the Asian Development Bank, one of the sponsors of the
program, plans to introduce the technique to countries such as
Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
In their latest issues published on August 17 or August 18, the
weekly science magazines Nature and Science each published a paper
by Professor Zhu and his colleagues on the experiments.
</P>
<P>
Christopher Mundt, a plant pathologist at Oregon State
University in Corvallis and a co-author of the paper, explained
that different types of rice blast attack different varieties of
rice.
</P>
<P>
In a monoculture field of rice, the blast can spread "like a
fire through a field of dry grass." The fungus has a harder time
finding a compatible host in a mixed environment.
</P>
<P>
In his commentary on the experiments published by Nature,
Martin Wolfe, a plant pathologist and research director of the Elm
Farm Research Center, an organic farming research center in
Britain, supports the approach.
</P>
<P>
Rice is the staple grain for about 3 billion people, mostly in
Asia, or half of the world's population.

<HEADLINE> Official on Reform of Personnel System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- As China is entering a new stage
in its socialist modernization drive, the key for realizing the
goals set at the 15th Congress of the Communist Party of China (
CPC), is to produce an army of top-notch cadres.
</P>
<P>
Reforms of the cadres and personnel system must keep up with
the times, said a leading official with Organization Department of
the CPC Central Committee today when commenting on the recently
issued guideline on the reform of the cadres and personnel system.
</P>
<P>
The reform echoes the call by cadres and ordinary people who
are dissatisfied at corruption in personnel management, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Along with the initial establishment of China's socialist
market economy, people's sense of democracy and rule of law is
increasing and the people have participated in personnel affairs
at a higher level, the official noted, adding that the guideline
is a general plan for the reform of personnel.
</P>
<P>
The guideline has set the basic goals, guiding principles and
basic demands and measures for deepening the personnel system
reform, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The official listed the main tasks of the reform as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- To let more cadres be publicly selected and taking over
positions via competition;
</P>
<P>
-- To find ways for both promotion and demotion;
</P>
<P>
-- To make new progress in the exchange of officials between
different localities;
</P>
<P>
-- To strengthen supervision over the selection and appointment
of officials.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey's gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to
grow by 4.4 percent in the second quarter of 2000, compared with a
1.7 percent contraction in the second quarter of 1999, reported
Turkish Daily News on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's GDP contracted by a record 6.4 percent in 1999, caused
by the aftermath of two devastating earthquakes in the country's
heavily industrialized northwest late in the year, and the Russian
and Asian financial crises in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The GDP expanded 5.6 percent in the first quarter of this year
and experts are foreseeing the year-end GDP to grow at 5-5.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
JEDDAH -- A consortium, formed by Saudi, Canadian, German and
Austrian companies, plans to bid for building a new railway line in
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The consortium, led by Saudi and Canadian companies, will submit
the relevant offer to the Communications Ministry later next month
to build the projected line, which sets off from northern Quryiat
to Hail then Qasim, and Riyadh before it terminates at the Red Sea
port city of Jeddah in the east.
</P>
<P>
If the consortium secures the project, the construction
operation will start from a line linking Damam and Jubail where
Saudi oil industry is mainly located. And the 3,000-kilometer line
would be completed in phases under set schedule.
</P>
<P>
Feasibility studies showed that the proposed line was of great
economic value as it would help transport mining and farm products
from the northern areas to the processing and communal zones in the
east.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The world's giant companies refuse to let private
Turkish airlines lease planes from them anymore because Turkey's
civil aviation sector is suffering from a terrible image problem,
reported Turkish Daily News on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 30 private aviation companies have been set up in recent
years but only seven have survived. The bankrupt companies failed
to make payments for the planes they have leased.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the state-run Turkish Airlines (THY) said that
the "embargo" will not affect THY, adding that those foreign
companies are trying to seize the Turkish market by imposing the
embargo on private Turkish companies.
</P>
<P>
RABAT -- Morocco officially announced that it has discovered an
abundant amount of oil and natural gas in its territories,
promising enough to turn the country from importer to producer of
energy.
</P>
<P>
King Mohammad VI on Sunday announced at the Youth Festival
gathering that "Morocco has discovered abundant good quality oil
and gas in Talisint, Fekik province."
</P>
<P>
That was the first official announcement on finding oil in
Morocco since U.S. companies launched prospection operations at the
areas bordering Algeria three months ago.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Newspaper Group Sets up TV News Units </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 22 (Xinhua)-- The Singapore Press Holding
Limited (SPH), the country's sole newspaper publisher, Tuesday
announced the setting up of two TV News units, paving the way for
the group's move into the broadcasting medium with the launch of
two TV channels to be run by its subsidiary SPH MediaWorks and
scheduled to go on air next year.
</P>
<P>
Leading editors from SPH newspapers told a press conference
Tuesday that one of the TV News units is subordinated to SPH's
English and Malay Newspapers Division (EMND) and the other is
within its Chinese Newspapers Division (CND).
</P>
<P>
They said the SPH TV News units will produce and supply news
and current affairs programs to the TV channels by leveraging on
the strong pool of journalistic resources and content produced by
SPH newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The key strategy adopted by SPH in its approach to TV News is
to build up a core team of broadcast journalists, supported and
linked to the wider resources of the EMND and CND newsrooms, they
added.
</P>
<P>
Two veterans, experienced in TV newsroom environment, have been
posted as editors to head the TV News units respectively and
printing journalists will benefit from their wealth of TV news
experience to cross over between news reporting for print as well
as TV.
</P>
<P>
Lim Jim Koon, Editor of Lianhe Zaobao, Singapore's leading
newspaper in Chinese language, said SPH is the first newspaper
publisher that operates TV channels at least in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Leslie Fong, Editor of Straits Times, the country's leading
English newspaper, expressed his confidence that leveraging on the
paper's existing journalistic talent will give SPH the competitive
edge in its TV News coverage.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Television Corporation of Singapore (TCS) and
Singapore Television of Singapore Pte Ltd (STV12) operate a total
of four channels and the Singapore Cable Vision Ltd (SCV) provides
cable TV services.
</P>
<P>
As the launch of SPH's two TV channels will bring to six the
total of TV channels in Singapore and the government has given the
TCS licenses to publish two newspapers, and competition in the
country's medium is expected to become more tense.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Prevent Chinese Tourists From Being Cheated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will step up efforts to
prevent Chinese tourists from being cheated by so called "zero-
dollar tours", Adisai Bodharamik, Minister to the Prime Minister's
Office and Chairman of the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT)
said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Adisai, who just came back from a two-day meeting of top
tourism officials of China, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore in
China, said, "Thailand is fully supporting concrete measures to
solve the problem of Chinese tourists getting unfair tour programs.
"
</P>
<P>
The problem of "zero-dollar tours", he said, is now very common
in Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, in which the Chinese tourists
pay a very low price for a tour program but have to suffer through
illegal activities like soliciting prostitutes, gambling or being
taken to shopping to generate kickbacks to the tourist guides.
</P>
<P>
"That is why the top tourism officials of the four countries
met in China," he said, noting the four sides have agreed in a
memorandum of understanding that they will use strict measures to
punish the tour operators who conducted "zero-dollar tours" or
other illegal activities to Chinese tourists.
</P>
<P>
If found guilty, the tour operator in one of the four countries
will be immediately taken off the list of certified trading
partners in other three countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that under the memorandum of understanding, tour
companies must guarantee that the cost per tourist in a program
must not fall below 18 U.S. dollars a day.
</P>
<P>
Adisai said he will soon call a meeting of all Thai tour
companies that handle Chinese tour groups to crack down illegal
tourism activities to Chinese tourists.

<HEADLINE> Low Customs Duties Boost Car Imports in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Sales of imported cars in
Romania, boosted by lower customs duties on imports from the
European Union (EU), doubled in the first half of this year, the
local daily newspaper Ziarul Financiar reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The country's customs duties on EU cars dropped to 12 percent
from 30 percent on January 1 this year. The duties are scheduled
to be cut by another 6 percent as of January 1, 2001, and will be
completely abolished beginning in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Other reasons for Romania's increase in car imports include the
expanded leasing system, lower car prices, and the cancellation of
the 5 percent road tax charged on new vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Romanians have a preference for European-made cars, and they
purchase cars that cost 8,000 to 12,000 U.S. dollars, according to
experts.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Accuses Britain of Not Helping in Anti-Graft Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan on Tuesday accused
Britain of failing to help trace people accused of corruption
against the government of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Pervez Musharaf, chairman of Pakistan's joint chiefs of staff
committee, speaking from Pakistan in a BBC radio interview, said
that his government believed a number of people suspected of graft
were living in Britain.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan had passed a list of 14 names to the British
Home Office, but Britain failed to help trace them.
</P>
<P>
"These are the people who have looted and plundered this poor
country and we thought we would get some assistance in getting
them back, or at least getting information on them, but I'm afraid
the Home Office was not forthcoming," Musharaf said in the
interview.
</P>
<P>
"I feel that the money they have looted may not make the
United Kingdom much richer, but it certainly makes Pakistan poorer,
" he added.
</P>
<P>
Many on the list are linked to former Pakistani prime
ministers Nawaz Sharif, who is now serving a jail sentence, and
Benazir Bhutto, who has been living in London for a year while
fighting a corruption conviction in Pakistan, BBC reported.
</P>
<P>
Denying the accusation, British Foreign Office Minister Peter
Hain said that Britain was ready to assist with Pakistan's anti-
corruption drive.
</P>
<P>
However, he said Britain could act only when the Pakistani
authorities transferred "a proper international arrest warrant for
these individuals."

PARIS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- French Interior Minister Jean-

by a violent minority" on the island of Corsica.
</P>
<P>
Chevenement said Monday that the "violent minority" has tried

The Corsicans want to remain with France and have asked the
central government to encourage greater democracy and respect for
law and order on the island, the Agence France-Presse (AFP)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Several militant organizations believe that armed resistance is
the only means left to confront the (French) state. This language
signals nothing good, Chevenement said.
</P>
<P>
Corsican militants staged several terrorist attacks on the
island this month, including the assassination of the moderate
nationalist leader Jean-Michel Rossi.

<HEADLINE> New York Liberty Rolls to WNBA Finals against Comets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The New York Liberty beat
Cleveland Rockers 81-67 Monday evening to advance to the WNBA
Championship Series against three-time titlists Houston Comets.
</P>
<P>
The Liberty, who outscored the Rockers 33-5 in the first 11
minutes at its Madison Square Garden, will ride a home court 13-
game winning streak into the opening game Thursday of the best-of-
three final against Comets.
</P>
<P>
Although the Comets hold home-court advantage, New York coach
Richie Adubato said of the opportunity to start at home, "It is
imperative that we win it."
</P>
<P>
New York has unfinished business with the Comets who have
denied them the title twice before. The Comets took last year's
third and decisive game 59-47 after earning the first of their
three successive crowns by topping New York 65-51 in the
Championship game in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"You've got to do a million and one things right to beat them,"
said Liberty's Teresa Weatherspoon, "They've won three
championships in a row. We've got to respect that but not fear
that."
</P>
<P>
New York used a sizzling start to dispatch Cleveland who owned
the league's worst record last year at 7-25 but improved to 17-15
to complete a remarkable turnaround and reach the postseason.
</P>
<P>
The Liberty whipped the home crowd into a frenzy by building a
33-5 cushion from 3-3 and 10-5 when the Rockers went the next 7:39
without a point before Tricia Bader drained a three-pointer, and
went on to a 46-27 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
The Championship Finals will start in New York on Thursday
before the Comets hold the second game on Saturday, and possibly
on Sunday should two teams tied the scoreboard.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Strives to Protect Coral Reef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, August 22 (Xinhua) -- This island province of Hainan
has been increasing patrol on the sea to curb random exploitation
of coral reefs in the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
Relevant departments have also joined hands in closing markets
for trading of coral reefs across the province and shutting down
lime kilns which depend on coral reefs for raw materials, said
Jiang Zelin, head of the Hainan Provincial Bureau of Marine
Fishery.
</P>
<P>
China's corals and coral reefs are mainly distributed among
archipelago such as Nansha, Zhongsha and Xisha in South China Sea,
as well as in offshore areas along the coast of Hainan Island.
Local farmers usually use explosives to blast coral reefs and use
raw materials for making handicraft or producing lime.
</P>
<P>
A joint team organized recently by the province to deal with
acts in violation with regulations to protect marine wildlife and
coral reef resources found that 80 percent of the coral reefs in
the offshore areas around Hainan Island have been destroyed in
varying degrees.
</P>
<P>
The area of coral reefs along the coast of Hainan has shrunk to
22,200 hectares, down by 55 percent according to comparable figure
in the 1960s.

since he arrived in the country, As Safir newspaper reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish envoy told reporters at Sheikh Abbad hill, one of

Council Resolutions 425 and 426 had been implemented after Israel
withdrew its troops from south Lebanon on May 24.
</P>
<P>
Knutsson flew by a U.N. helicopter earlier Monday from Beirut to
the headquarters of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon
(UNIFIL) at the coastal town of Naqoura, near the border with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy said his mission was also to confirm that the
UNIFIL would carry out its mission of helping the Lebanese
authorities re-establish Lebanon's sovereignty all the way to the
internationally recognized border.
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL spokesman Nejib Friji said that UNIFIL commanders briefed
Knutsson on developments along the Blue Line and security condition
in the area.

Knutsson, a former UNIFIL senior advisor, then inspected a
platoon of Nepalese soldiers at Marwahine, a border point, and met
a unit of Finnish peacekeepers at Khiam.
</P>
<P>
This is Knutsson's first trip since he arrived in Lebanon on
August 16.
</P>
<P>
Knutsson was appointed by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan as a
diplomatic and political liaison with the Lebanese government to
oversee the implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolutions 425
and 426.
</P>
<P>
Knutsson will serve for an initial period of six months, during

<HEADLINE> U.S. "Convert Spy" Ready to Leave Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Jeremiah Mattysse, the American
intelligence officer reported missing from his Texas base and found
in Israel, has decided to return to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Mattysse, the so-called "convert spy", is being questioned by
police in Petah Tikva, near the coastal city of Tel Aviv and has
agreed to leave Israel out of his own will, said Israel Radio
reports on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The officer, who was located Monday by Israeli police detectives
in a hostel in the southern desert town of Mitzpeh Ramon, was taken
to police headquarters in Petah Tikva without resistance.
</P>
<P>
Mattysse, 50, served as a senior intelligence officer in the U.
S. Army and had access to top-secret information. Three weeks ago,
he went on vacation and failed to return to duty when his leave
expired.
</P>
<P>
The officer, who converted to Judaism, made his way to Israel
and has applied for Israeli immigrant status.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a lot of information about him came from his self-
styled girlfriend, Rivka Nir, who once hinted that Mattysse had
been spying for Israel and brought with him several bags of secret
information.
</P>
<P>
Mattysse has dissociated himself from Nir, saying that she made
statements about him that were false.
</P>
<P>
"I am not a spy. I never passed on any classified information,"
Mattysse told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that he had talked to U.S. and Israeli officials
and described his presence in Israel as being on vacation.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli police have no legal authority to arrest the
American officer or extradite him to the United States, and have
tried to persuade him to return to his country.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Sanctions Claim Over 10,000 Lives Last Month in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 10,000 Iraqis died in
July because of the United Nations sanctions against Iraq, bringing
the total number of victims of the sanctions to 1,335,060 since
1990, Iraqi Health Ministry said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement that 7,457 children under the
age of five died of diarrhea, pneumonia, respiratory infections and
malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
As to the elderly people, 2,843 died of heart diseases,
diabetes, hypertension and malignant neoplasms.
</P>
<P>
Such a high mortality rate, due to malnutrition and severe
medicine shortage caused by the decade-long sanctions, was in sharp
contrast with the same month in 1989, when some 378 children and
430 elderly people died, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly called on the U.N. to unconditionally lift
the stringent sanctions, which was imposed against the country
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Iraq has long accused the United States and Britain of
impeding the implementation of the U.N. oil-for-food program by
deliberately blocking the contracts Iraq signed with foreign
countries to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. humanitarian program allows Iraq to sell crude oil
every six months to finance the vital imports of humanitarian goods
to help offset the crippling impacts of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Hans Von Sponeck, former U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq,
and Jutta Burghardt, former representative of the World Food
Program, resigned in February to protest the continuing sanctions
which caused the worsening humanitarian situation in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Aventajado Given Fresh Authority in Sulu Hostage Negotiation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has given chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado
the authority to make decisions on the ground, to secure the safe
release of the remaining hostages of the Abu Sayyaf, a
presidential spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Press Secretary and Presidential Spokesman Ricardo Puno made
the remarks at a press briefing, although he clarified that the
all-or-nothing policy of the government still stands.
</P>
<P>
"The all-or-nothing policy still holds," Puno said, although he
noted that Aventajado has been instructed by the president "to go
ahead and make decisions on the ground, meaning he has the
authority to resolve this issue."
</P>
<P>
Under that authority, Puno explained, "if there are
flexibilities that he (Aventajado) has to exercise, he has the
discretion to do so, of course, as long as the objective is
obtained which is the release of the hostages."
</P>
<P>
The release of the remaining European hostages by the Abu
Sayyaf, which was scheduled last weekend, was derailed by the
refusal of the group to let all of them go at the same time.
</P>
<P>
The band was apprehensive that the military will go all out
against them if they release all the foreign nationals at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Abu Sayyaf offered to release only two of the
hostages and keep the rest of them, in the meantime, an offer that
was rejected by the government.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf continues to hold hostage six French, two Finns,
two Germans, two South Africans and a Lebanese woman from the
group they have abducted from Malaysia in April.

proposal for a comprehensive international convention against
terrorism scheduled to be taken up at the United Nations General
Assembly session next month.

Following a meeting between Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee and the Maldives President Abdul Gayoom, who arrived here
on Monday, a spokesman of Indian External Affairs Ministry told
the press that the two sides "articulated their strong common
position against terrorism and fundamentalism".
</P>
<P>
Maldives supported India's initiative on having a
comprehensive international convention against terrorism, he
added.
</P>
<P>
At a banquet hosted in honor of the visiting Maldives
President last evening, Indian President kocheril Raman Narayanan
appealed for a early adoption of a convention on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
India has been supplying defense equipment to Maldives which
has a population of 260,000.

build an integrated manufacturing facility that will include a
state-of-the-art wafer fabrication facility and an advanced
assembly and test operation for wireless communications equipment.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Arrives in Ramallah for Pushing Peace Forward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
arrived in the West Bank city of Ramallah Tuesday for an official
visit to the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, who flew in by helicopter, was greeted by Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat, a host of
Palestinian officials and religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Abdullah are expected to discuss the latest
developments of the Middle East peace process in the wake of the
failed peace talks at Camp David, the U.S., last month between
Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and U.S. President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are also to tackle ways to push forward the
stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
The monarch will later in the day head for Tel Aviv for a
meeting with Barak, during which he is reportedly to reiterate his
kingdom's dissatisfaction with Israel's control over Jerusalem and
support for Palestinian refugees to return home.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Middle
East war and declared Jerusalem as its "eternal and indivisible"
capital of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Currently Jordan is hosting some 1.5 million Palestinian
refugees registered with the United Nations. Amman insists
they should have the rights to choose between returning to their
homeland or staying in the kingdom while asking for compensations
from parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
This is Abdullah's second visit to Israel and his third to the
Palestinian territories since he became Jordan's king in February
1999.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been a major peace broker between Israel and Arab
neighbors since it signed a peace treaty in 1994 with the Jewish
state.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Double Oil Imports from Oman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Suwat told reporters that his ministry had submitted a bigger
oil order, increased from 17,000 barrels a day to 34,000 barrels a
day, to Oman's energy ministry through the Omani Embassy to
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil from Oman, a major oil producing country outside the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), is about 10
to 20 cents a barrel cheaper than that of OPEC members, he said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from doubling oil import, the Thai government had also
decided to extend its oil contract with Oman, scheduled to expire
in November, for another year, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The move was part of the government's efforts to ease
difficulties faced by Thai people due to a continued increase in
gasoline prices over the past few months.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices are widely expected to rise again Wednesday to a
record level of more than 17 baht (42.5 cents) a liter for premium
gasoline in Greater Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, Thailand's five major oil refiners plan
to propose some changes in oil product specifications that may
help arrest soaring oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The changes would increase the production yield from crude at
the cost of slightly relaxed environmental standards.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned Petroleum Authority of Thailand has forced the
partly state-owned Thaioil, which commands the largest share of
the Thai oil market, to reduce the refining margin by one U.S.
dollars a barrel in order to curb pump prices increases.
</P>
<P>
The world oil price is at its highest level in 10 years,
averagely at 31 U.S. Dollars a barrel, and is expected to maintain
at high levels until the end of the year before beginning to
decline, given a maintained oil production level.

<HEADLINE> Britain Demands Release of TV Crew by Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Tuesday demanded the
immediate release by Liberian authorities of a four-man British
television crew, who were indicted for espionage.
</P>
<P>
"It brings the Liberian government into collision course not
just with the United Nations ... over sanctions busting and
support for the rebel forces in Sierra Leone, but now also against
the whole international climate, which favors press freedom,"
Foreign Office minister Peter Hain told BBC Radio.
</P>
<P>
"They are not spies, they are journalists, and this is an
attack on international press freedom."
</P>
<P>
"They should be released forthwith and the charges immediately
withdrawn," said Hain.
</P>
<P>
The two Britons, a Sierra Leonean and a South African were
arrested on Monday when they were working on a documentary for
Britain's Channel Four television.
</P>
<P>
Reuters quoted legal sources in Liberia as saying that if
convicted, the four, who arrived in the country on August 1, might
face up to 10 years in jail.
</P>
<P>
Channel Four said the crew were in Liberia on legitimate
journalistic business and they had been working on a documentary
about how an African country could end a cycle of political
violence.

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Trial Re-Opens After Summer Recess </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Cable
communications from intelligence services were challenged at the
Lockerbie trial as it resumed on Tuesday after a three-week summer
recess.
</P>
<P>
The defense team asked the prosecution to provide cable
communications in their entity after it argued that the version
sent to the defense team had been edited with sections and words
blanked out.
</P>
<P>
Defense Counsel William Taylor told the Scottish court on Dutch
soil that he had been informed that the cables, between United
States security service agents and Washington after interviews
with a Libyan defector, had been edited because they contained
sensitive or irrelevant information.
</P>
<P>
"I emphatically do not accept that what lies behind the blanked-
out sections is of no relevance to a cross-examiner," said Taylor.
</P>
<P>
The cables are gathered by the prosecution to serve as key
evidence in its case against Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and Al-Amin
Khalifa Fahima who are accused of planting a bomb on board of Pan
Am Flight 103. The mid-air explosion on December 21, 1988, killed
259 people on the New York-bound airliner and 11 others on the
ground in the Scottish town of Lockerbie.
</P>
<P>
The cables contained information about the interviews with
Abdul Majid Giaka, a Libyan secret agent who defected shortly
before the Lockerbie bombing.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan defector was scheduled to appear in court to testify
behind a screen with his voice disguised about what he knows about
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
The Lockerbie trial, that took almost 12 years to investigate
and prepare, finally went underway on May 3 this year and is now
expected to last up to a year.

<HEADLINE> Computer Experts to Work on Countering Olympic Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A crack team of computer
experts will be working around the clock at next month's Olympics
to counter a new type of attack - cyber terrorism, a senior
Australian government official said in Sydney on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
While computer hackers who change finals results and play
around with medal winners may not be perceived to be as dangerous
as armed terrorists, there is no doubt they could cause havoc and
serious embarrassment for games organisers.
</P>
<P>
Australian Federal Communications Minister Richard Alston said
before a cabinet meeting that the use of the Internet to disrupt
the Games was being considered a serious threat.
</P>
<P>
The thousands of results from the 39 venues will all be kept in
electronic form and posted on the official Olympic website which
is expected to receive more than one billion hits.
</P>
<P>
Alston said the methods being used to protect the system from
hackers would remain secret.
</P>
<P>
"We are not about to telegraph our punches - but clearly the
important thing is to be acutely aware that you can't take
anything for granted," he said.
</P>
<P>
"You can't assume goodwill, you've got to proceed on the basis
that there will be people trying to cause difficulties and do your
best to avoid those," he added.

LONDON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Liverpool will not be fined
despite having two players sent off in their 2-0 defeat by Arsenal,
the Football Association (FA) said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
New FA rules say clubs will be fined 25,000 pounds (37,000 U.S.
dollars) if they receive six cautions in one match.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool picked up six cards during the English premier league
defeat at Highbury on Monday, including four yellow and two reds
for Gary McAllister and Dietmar Hamann.
</P>
<P>
However, only five players were cautioned because Hamann
received two yellow cards.
</P>
<P>
An FA spokesman said: "For the fine to be administered, six
different names have to be taken by the referee."
</P>
<P>
Arsenal's Patrick Vieira was sent off for the second time in
two games in the 73rd minute of the match.

BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen B-share market

was 235.76 million Hong Kong dollars or 73.95 percent more than
the total on Monday, according to Homeway, China's leading on-line
financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
The merger speculation of the Class A and Class B shares had
driven the index to a peak of 141.23 points in early afternoon,
the top level in almost three years. However, the market suddenly
reversed its courses on late-day profit-taking that had
significantly cut into the impressive gains, dragging the index
into the red.
</P>
<P>
Market breadth turned decisively negative. Losers beat gainers
by 47 to 8, with 1 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Benelux Ent rose 4.76 percent to 3.08 Hong Kong dollars, while
Zhonglu climbed up 2.49 percent to 3.29 Hong Kong dollars.

Hefei Meiling fell 8.73 percent to 2.30 Hong Kong dollars,
while Nanshan Power lost 8.60 percent to 3.40 Hong Kong dollars.
</P>

Homeway analysts predicted that the market's latest aggressive
performance is likely to be hurdled in the coming sessions as it
is poised to meet resistance resulted from profit-taking.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Global Warming Campaign Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen environmental
organizations on Tuesday launched a massive campaign aimed at
curbing global warming.
</P>
<P>
A Website, www.climatevoice.org, was initiated to enable people
around the world to send 10 million messages to world political
leaders, demanding that they use the November climate summit in
The Hague to reduce the pollution that causes global warming, said
the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF), one of the 16 organizations
launching the initiative.
</P>
<P>
"It is now 10 years since the international scientific
community issued its first warning about the threats the world
faces from climate change," said Andrew Kerr of WWF's Climate
Change Campaign.
</P>
<P>
"That's why we're aiming for 10 million messages, one million
for each year, (to tell) that governments have failed to take
action. It is scandalous that available solutions to this problem
have been so thoroughly neglected."
</P>
<P>
At the Website, visitors can e-mail world leaders and express
their concern about global warming. The first targets on the site
will be European Union heads of state and government. They can
download a petition that can be signed and sent off-line. They can
also send friends cyber postcards to encourage them to join the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The site is being launched in English on Tuesday. Versions in
French, Spanish and German will follow.
</P>
<P>
At November's climate summit -- the Sixth Conference of the
Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change -- governments must meet their deadline for finalizing
rules for operating the Kyoto climate treaty, the only
international agreement for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases
from the industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
Failing to agree in November would make it questionable whether
nations would be able to achieve the Kyoto timetable for reducing
emissions in the coming decade, WWF warned, adding that this would
set the worst possible example for stopping global warming in the
21st century.

<HEADLINE> Japan, DPRK Fail to Narrow Rifts on Key Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators from Japan and the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) failed to narrow
their differences Tuesday on lingering disputes at the end of the
first day of their second round of talks in Tokyo on normalizing
diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
The two sides remained apart over two key issues left over from
past talks -- the alleged abduction of at least 10 Japanese
nationals by DPRK agents in the 1970s and 1980s and compensation
for Japan's 1910-1945 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula, the
Kyodo news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides maintained their "basic positions" over the two
issues, on which they clashed during the first round of
negotiations held in April in Pyongyang, a Japanese Foreign
Ministry official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The April meeting marked a resumption of the two countries'
normalization talks which collapsed in 1992 after eight rounds.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the negotiators reaffirmed their commitment to "
normalizing the abnormal ties...and establishing new good
neighborly and friendly relations before the 21st century to avoid
leaving problems unresolved to the next generation," the official
said.
</P>
<P>
The official said the two sides refrained from any substantial
talks in the approximately 60-minute first-day session, leaving
them to the next plenary negotiations on Thursday in Kisarazu in
the adjacent prefecture of Chiba after a one-day break Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Jong Thae Hwa, who heads the DPRK delegation,
stressed that his country "has not changed at all its position of
taking up liquidation of the past as a priority issue," according
to the official.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kojiro Takano, who leads the Japanese side as
ambassador in charge of the normalization talks, alluded to Japan'
s priority issues such as the alleged abductions of Japanese
nationals. The DPRK denied that it had kidnapped any Japanese.
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials said the two sides are unlikely to achieve a
breakthrough this time, but hope to lay the groundwork for the
third round during which the two sides intend to begin substantial
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The next session is expected to take place in October in
Beijing or another city in a third country.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK delegation, which arrived in Japan Monday, is
scheduled to head home on Friday morning.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Supports Syrian FM's Call for Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid has reiterated the need to hold an Arab summit and
expressed support for a call made by Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk
Shareh in this regard, Egypt's Al Ahram daily reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
There is "increasing importance to convene a well-prepared Arab
summit" to discuss issues related to the Arab nation, including the
Middle East peace process, Abdel-Meguid said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The latest call made by Shareh in this regard "has reaffirmed
such a need," the chief of the pan-Arab forum was quoted as saying
by the newspaper, which usually mirrors Egyptian government's
views.
</P>
<P>
The request for holding an Arab summit is "natural and
legitimate," he added.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in
Alexandria on Monday, Shareh urged Arab leaders to meet to seek
ways of ending the "wretched situation of disunity" in the Arab
world for the benefit of the Arab nation and the regional peace and
stability. He said this situation must not be allowed to continue.
</P>
<P>
But Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa has expressed
reservations over Shareh's call. Responding to his statement,
Moussa suggested on Monday that Shareh's goals could be
accomplished at a planned meeting of Arab foreign ministers on
September 3 in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Talks between Mubarak and Shareh focused on the need to
coordinate Arab positions on several problems, and both sides
agreed to "look at ways to assure such coordination at the most
efficient level," namely the Arab League's upcoming foreign
ministers meeting, Moussa said.

<P>
Chan said that since the signing ceremony of the Memorandum of
Understanding and a Plan of Cooperation on TCM between the
Singapore Ministry of Health (MOH) and China's State
Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (SATCM) in July
1999, both parties have proceeded to work together in the spirit
of cooperation and have started mutual exchange of information and

Malaysia and Vietnam is expected to grow by 20 percent this year
following renewed interest by businessmen from both sides to step
up trade, Vietnamese ambassador to Malaysia Tran Trong Toan said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
There has been a steady stream of Malaysian businessmen
visiting Vietnam and vice-versa looking at opportunities to step

rubber to Vietnam and importing rice, groundnut, cashew nut,
vegetable and aquatic products from Vietnam.

trade imbalance with Vietnam, according to the ambassador.

He said that Malaysia is expected to increase import of rice to
150,000 tons this year from 100,000 tons last year.

Malaysia ranks third among ASEAN countries, next to Singapore
and Thailand, with 70 projects already implemented and 941 million
U.S. dollars already committed.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian investments are mainly concentrated in food
processing plants, textile and garments, banking and the hotel
industry.

is trying to emulate Malaysia's transformation success from being
agricultural-based economy to industrial based economy, he said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Dismisses Rumors of Late Succession of WTO Head Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's candidate will take
his turn to head the World Trade Organization (WTO) in September
2002, Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan confirmed here Tuesday,
dismissing rumors that incumbent WTO chief will continue his
office for another three years after his current three-year term
ends then.
</P>
<P>
Surin was quoted by Thai News Agency as saying that a
resolution of the WTO's General Assembly last year clearly
indicated that Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister
Supachai Panitchpakdi would replace Mike Moore from New Zealand as
the world trade body's director-general in September 2002.
</P>
<P>
Surin dismissed as groundless recent rumors that Moore would
continue his office for another three years.
</P>
<P>
Prudent checks on legal principles have already been made that
the world trade watchdog can be led by two directors who shares a
six-year term, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The final decision of the General Assembly of the WTO on the
issue in July 1999 must be irrevocable and be strictly followed so
that the world trade body's creditability and prestige would
always be maintained, Surin pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Emerald Trade Costs Zambia $300 Million last Year  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unscrupulous dealers have been blamed for the unsavory trade,
it said.
</P>
<P>
The paper's investigations revealed that in the previous year,
Kagem Minerals has allegedly been undermined by the unscrupulous
dealers and has failed to perform as one of the world's leading
emeralds producers.
</P>
<P>
The failure by the Copperbelt Province-based gemstone mining
firm to perform well on the global market has been attributed to
methods used by some dealers in auctioning the precious stones on
the local market before they are off loaded on the world markets
at very high prices.
</P>
<P>
According to Kagem insiders and gemstones auctioneers' sources
in Lusaka, the named dealers have been stage-managing auctions at
which a curtail of business persons linked to a named company
offer very low prices for the stones.
</P>
<P>
What has been happening is that the same dealers organize
people they know to attend the auctions at which the emeralds are
sold. At such auctions, the bidders are strictly told to
undervalue the stones and offer very low prices, it said.
</P>
<P>
"Such illegal business practices have resulted in the country
receiving very little or no income at all from the sales of the
stones on the world market. They are illegally reaping from Zambia,
" the source said.
</P>
<P>
Another Lusaka mining source stated: " on the global market,
Colombia which has by far very inferior stones compared to those
of Zambia, managed to reap more than three billion U.S. dollars
but the records we have is that Zambia only managed a meager 300,
000 dollars, yet we're regarded as the world's biggest producer of
high quality emeralds."
</P>
<P>
A mining sector stakeholder, Ben Mulenga, has since written to
the Zambian government, various political parties and relevant
government ministries to protest against the illegal practices.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Mulenga said that the practice by dealers to
involve individuals and firms they can dictate terms to, is
detrimental to the development of the gemstone and mining sector
of the country.
</P>
<P>
He called for quick government intervention in the business,
adding that the state's intervention will normalize operations and
the running of the mining firm.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Ministry of Finance and Economic Development officials
revealed that the government is already reviewing recommendations
from the Zambia Privatization Agency on how best operations can be
normalized at Kagem Minerals which was privatized in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Putin Declares Wednesday Mourning Day for Kursk Crew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin
on Tuesday declared Wednesday a day of mourning for the crew of
the sunken nuclear submarine Kursk.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian nuclear submarine Kursk sank in the Barents Sea on
August 12, 2000, its crew perished. Expressing my grief for the
perished and condolences to their families and relatives, I
announce August 23, 2000 a day of mourning in the Russian
Federation," Putin said in a decree released by the Kremlin press
service.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Russian flag will be flown at half-mast
throughout the country. Cultural institutions, television and
radio broadcasting companies will be ordered to cancel their
entertainment events and shows in the day.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government, along with government agencies across
the country, will take necessary measures to help the families of
the dead, Putin said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, the Itar-Tass news agency quoted the Northern
Fleet headquarters as saying that to care for the numerous
sorrowful relatives of the dead crewmen will be the main task at
this moment for the Command of the Russian Navy and local
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Many of the relatives are suffering from shock and need urgent
medical aid. However, they insist on a request that the command
bring them to the tragedy scene in the Barents Sea to mourn their
beloved ones.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters said that if weather permits, the relatives
might be brought to the scene on board the hospital ship Svir.
</P>
<P>
Monday, the Russian government decided to grant the family of
each dead crewman 1.5 million rubles (about 54,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Russian Northern Fleet commander, Admiral Vyacheslav Popov,
on Tuesday praised the Kursk crew for honestly serving their
homeland to the last minute and carrying out their duty to the end.
</P>
<P>
Tass Tuesday cited experts as saying that the crew behaved
heroically by shutting down the sub's two nuclear reactors in the
last minutes of their lives.
</P>
<P>
The sailors would have had a chance to stay alive if the
reactors had not been shut down, specialists believe. However, the
crewmen who survived the terrible explosions on the sub's board
took a difficult decision to shut down the reactors in order to
avoid radioactive contamination, instead of timely escape and
leaving the nuke engines in work.

<HEADLINE> Russian Navy Denies Report on More Kursk Crew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Russian navy Tuesday denied
media reports that there were 130 crewmen instead of 118 aboard
the sunken nuclear submarine Kursk, the Interfax news agency
quoted the navy as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The real exact number has been announced, and it is now and
will remain 118 people. It is an official roster of the personnel
on the submarine," Igor Dygalo, aide to the commander-in-chief of
the Russian navy, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"In accordance with all requirements that have to be met, when
organizing military training, and especially the military training
of submarine forces, the presence of additional people, so-called
passengers, at sea is prohibited," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"We said right away that besides the crew the submarine was
also carrying representatives of the headquarters of the unit, to
which this submarine belonged, and one civil specialist. This is
all normal practice. Ships often go to military training with
representatives of the headquarters of their unit and industry
representatives on board," it noted.
</P>
<P>
The Komsomolskaya Pravda daily on Tuesday quoted sources as
saying that there may have been civilians among the 12 persons
that were not regular crew members of Kursk.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear submarine went down to sea when it was attending a
military exercise in the Barents Sea on August 12. Rescue efforts
were declared futile and all the 118 sailors on board declared
dead on Monday. The cause of the tragedy remains hazy.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Schedule for Gas Pipeline Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- China late this year will complete
the gas field development plan for the construction of a 4,167-km
gas pipeline from the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in the
northwest to Shanghai Municipality in the east.
</P>
<P>
According to Yan Sanzhong, deputy manager of the China
National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), the pipeline will be built
section by section in the 2001-2003 period and gas will be sent
to the Yangtze River Delta in 2004.
</P>
<P>
He said, the pipeline will be able to transport 12 billion
cubic meters of gas to the Yangtze River Delta a year by 2005.
</P>
<P>
The gas pipeline will run from the Tarim Oilfield in Xinjiang
to Shanghai through nine provinces, municipalities and autonomous
regions. It will cost 120 billion yuan (about 14 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Operation of the pipeline will greatly ease the acute energy
shortage in the Yangtze River Delta, Yan said at a recent national
conference on western development.

ANKARA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit criticized President
Ahmet Necdet Sezer on Monday for vetoing the government's decree on
the sacking of civil servants involved in fundamentalist and
separatist activities once again.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said that "there are disagreements on the duties and
responsibilities of the president and the cabinet. It is impossible
to work in harmony if these disagreements are not solved."
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Sezer's second rejection of the decree will
likely cause the cabinet's resignation and a state crisis.
</P>
<P>
Yenibinyil:
</P>
<P>
-- The Iraqi government condemned Turkey on Monday for carrying
out an air raid on northern Iraq in a bid to chase the separatist
Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged an anti-Ankara
campaign since 1984 for self-rule in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi Foreign Ministry spokesman said that "Baghdad has the
right to determine the right time to give the necessary response to
this violence."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman claimed that the August 15 air raid by Turkey
caused the death of 40 civilians and the injury of 10 others.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish police Monday seized explosives, grenades and a gun
in a car passing on the Bosphorus Bridge in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the explosives were being carried to DHKP-
C, a radical terrorist group in the country, which was attempting
to launch bomb attacks to give support for an imprisoned member.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish police seized an original painting of Picasso
called "Portrait of a Young Woman", which was stolen from its owner

</P>
<P>
The painting, which is valued at 17 million U.S. dollars, was
painted by Picasso in 1903.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli and Palestinian security agents have uncovered an
Islamic terror network and arrested 23 people, some of whom are
linked with Osama bin Laden, America's most wanted terrorist.
</P>
<P>
The arrests have taken place over the past few months and
include three Israeli Arabs who were linked with the Islamic
movement.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior security source, the terrorists planned to
carry out a number of attacks aimed at causing mass casualties. The
aim was to disrupt the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli police detectives Monday located the missing American
intelligence officer, Jeremiah Mathis, in a youth hostel in the
southern desert town of Mitzpeh Ramon.
</P>
<P>
Since finding him, detectives have been trying to convince
Mathis that he needs to return to the United States. The police
have no legal authority to arrest him or extradite him to the U.S.,
so if they fail to convince him to return, they will have to
release him.
</P>
<P>
Mathis filed an application for new immigration status with the
Israeli Interior Ministry ten days ago. The request file has been
transferred to the police.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's water crisis necessitates the immediate import of
water from Turkey and the establishment of two desalination plants,
not just the one plant approved by the ministerial economics
committee, Water Commissioner Shimon Tal said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations with Ankara on the import of 45 million cubic
meters of water in a year in old oil tankers have stalled over the
question of price.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The chief of staff in Israeli Prime Minister's office Haim
Mandel-Shaked Monday stepped down from his position following harsh
criticisms of Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Shaked, considered one of Barak's closest aides, had originally
been due to leave his post in October, after the Jewish holidays.
</P>
<P>
Barak told his Labor Party upper echelon on Monday that the
aftershocks caused by resignations in his office will pass quickly.
The prime minister said he will not immediately replace Shaked, and
that his duties will be split between National Security Adviser
Danny Yatom and Director-General Yossi Kucik.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Countries Efforts to Eradicate Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The members countries of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) here Tuesday
started a three-day meeting aimed at drawing up a new poverty
eradication program.
</P>
<P>
Opening the meeting which attended by senior officials of the
10 member countries, Indonesian Coordinating Minister for Social
and Welfare and Poverty Eradication Basri Hasanuddin noted in his
address that poverty in the region needs greater attention and
must be uprooted soon.
</P>
<P>
"We must solve this problem if we plan to move ahead with
another development program," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the participants to produce a solution which
could be implemented by all ASEAN member countries.
</P>
<P>
"There must be a joint network on this (poverty eradication)
among ASEAN countries because the ASEAN must work together to
improve the peoples' welfare," Hasanuddin added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Indonesia's poverty eradication program, the
minister said the central government has decided to give greater
authority to local governments in handling the people's problems.
</P>
<P>
"It is very effective because they (local governments) are the
institutions who know exactly what is going on in the society," he
said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN is composed of Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore,
the Philippines, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and
Vietnam.

<P>
MANILA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will

The operation of these medical facilities, he said, is in line
with the directive of President Joseph Estrada to make quality
medical services accessible to Mindanao's poor residents.

Karamoja, we must link the cow, water and the mother earth through
irrigation," said the vice president.

<TEXT>
<P>
The new town of Fengjie is made primarily by a stone-paved road
consisting of over a thousand steps, flanked on each side with two-
story buildings, the upper story for families and the lower for
bookstores, art galleries and other stores.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the road received the nickname "stone ladder" and
attracts quite a few visitors at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Different from the old towns, which habitually discharged
rubbish and wastewater directly into the Yangtze River, the new
town of Fengjie is equipped with various environmental protection
measures like a rubbish processing ground and sewage treatment
plant that entails new technology.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, clean energy like natural gas and liquefied petroleum
gas have replaced coal to become the major fuel sources.
</P>
<P>
Compared with Fengjie, the neighboring town of Yunyang is much
faster in getting up and running. Not only has its infrastructure
construction been completed, but local government and residents
have already begun to move in.
</P>
<P>
The old town of Yunyang used to have nearly 100 factories,
governmental agencies, schools, and about 30,000 residents along a
single street about 10 meters wide. By contrast, the new town has
been divided into different functional districts for residences,
culture, business and industry.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Chongqing alone has allocated 5 billion
yuan to build the new towns. Construction in most of these 13 new
towns is still in full swing.
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, local residents will move into their new homes next
year, as scheduled by the local government.

SHIJIAZHUANG, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A fresco museum, the first
in China, will be built at a temple in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang,
capital of north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
The 1,200-year-old Pilu Temple boasts more than 200 square
meters of fine murals drawn in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). These
murals feature traditional Chinese culture, history, various
peoples, historic and legendary stories.
</P>
<P>
The murals are as valuable as those at Dunhuang Grottoes in
Gansu Province, in Fahai Temple in Beijing, and in Yongle Palace
of north China's Shanxi Province, said experts with Shijiazhuang
City Bureau of Cultural Heritage.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the bureau said that the museum will also house
thousands of murals unearthed from ancient tombs and collected by
museums in the province.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources said, the first thing to do will be how to
restore these damaged murals, because most of them have been
eroded.

CHONGQING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- In three years, Fengjie, a
county in southwest China's Chongqing municipality, will sink to
the bottom of a huge reservoir.
</P>
<P>
Over a million people who live in Fengjie and 12 nearby
counties in the Three Gorges Dam area will have to leave when a
great reservoir, part of the world's largest hydraulic project,
will form in 2003 and devour everything in the basin.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the local government is racing against time to put
up new towns in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of others still have to travel long
distances, some as far to Shanghai in east China, to live, though
now the capacity of the new settlement is limited.
</P>
<P>
Not far from the old one, a new town of Fengjie has almost
taken shape. Despite the fact that Fengjie has yet to unveil its
face, people can tell from its primary design that like the other
12 towns, it has been carefully planned.
</P>
<P>
The residential districts are multi-functional like modern
cities, the buildings are in various styles, trees and flowers dot
the green belt that take up 60 percent of the total area of town.
</P>
<P>
For the moment, Fengjie is like a huge construction site. Major
buildings like shopping centers, banks and insurance company
offices have been completed, while hundreds of other offices and
residential buildings are under construction.

TURPAN (XINJIANG), August 22 (Xinhua) -- China plans to invest
a huge sum of money into the preservation project for an ancient
city in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
A total of 17.5 million yuan (about 2.1 million U.S. dollars)
will be poured into repairs of the Jiaohe Ruins, the world's
biggest and best-protected relics of clay-built city.
</P>
<P>
Located some 20 km. east of Turpan, the ruins of Jiaohe,
meaning "old city between two rivers", is an ancient frontier army
citadel of the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.- 24 A.D.).
</P>
<P>
As the capital of Turpan's earliest residents of the Cheshi
State, the 220,000-square-meter city is also the most intact
capital relics of the country.
</P>
<P>
Yue Feng, president of the Cultural Heritage Administration of
Xinjiang, said that repair work will be done to the temples,
eastern city gate, ancient houses, pagodas and the thousand
Buddhas cave.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the administration has spent some 3.3
million yuan on the protection of the city, a religious and
cultural center of the region.
</P>
<P>
As a key link of the ancient Silk Road, the Jiaohe City had
both geographical and strategically significance. It was totally
destroyed in wars and has remained an eerie but beautiful sight in
the desert.

TURPAN (XINJIANG), August 22 (Xinhua) -- Su Gong Tower, the
largest ancient tower in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, stands to the east of Turpan City, along with a
mosque which could accommodate 1,000 prayers.
</P>
<P>
Built in 1777, during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), the tower
is 37 m. tall and 10 m. in diameter at the bottom. A 77-step
spiral stair leads up to the top. Its body is made of bricks in a
dozen pattern with a strong Islamic style.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the tower was made a State-level key protective unit.
</P>
<P>
The tower was built by the then Turpan king and his son, who
were leading a group of Uygur people, to show their loyalty to the
Qing government and Allah. Some local historians believe the
building was set up in memory of an anti-separatist war jointly
fought by people from Uygur, Han, Manchu and Hui groups.
</P>
<P>
In 1731, the Turpan Uygur group was relocated to Dunhuang by
the Qing government so as to avoid invasion rebels and 30 years
later, they were moved back to Turpan after the rebellion was
quelled by the Qing army.

The ancient bombs, two km. north of the ancient Gaochang, used
to be a public burial place for officials and ordinary people of
different ethnic groups in the ancient city of Gaochang.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1950s, the ancient tombs have been excavated by
archeologists for 14 times and so far, 456 tombs have been
discovered with over 10,000 valuable relics unearthed. In 1985,
the tombs was made a State-level key protective unit.
</P>
<P>
Most of the relics found are scripts, murals, silk paintings
and earthen figurines, which reflect all aspects of the life at
the time. These relics are very useful for studying the history of
West China, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
The Study on Turpan, or Turpanology, is as much known as the
Study on Dunhuang Grottoes. Scripts are the main part of the
research on Turpan.

<TEXT>
<P>
The meeting will be a follow-up on July talks between President
Paul Kagame of Rwanda and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni.
</P>
<P>
However, it is not clear when the meeting between the two would
be held, said a Tuesday report of the New Vision newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"This is simply a follow-up on the July meeting between the two
presidents. At that meeting, Wapa (James Wapakabulo) and I were
assigned tasks so we will be discussing that," Murigande was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The two are also supposed to discuss Museveni's proposed visit
at an unknown date to Kigali on Kagame's invitation, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents met in July to iron out relations between
the two countries, marred by disagreements between rebel factions
they support in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and clashes
between the Uganda People's Defense Forces and Rwandan Army in the
Congolese city of Kisangani in May and June this year.
</P>
<P>
Murigande declined to discuss the agenda of his meeting with
Wapakabulo, but ruled out reports that they were establishing a
new committee to handle relations between the two countries, said
the report.

<HEADLINE> Rescue of Russian Sub Suspended for Now </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 22 (Xinhua) -- All rescue operations at the site
of the wreck of the Russian submarine Kursk in the Barents Sea
have been suspended since Monday evening, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A decision to this effect in view of an obvious hopelessness of
further efforts was taken on Monday night by the Russian
government commission on the accident.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, divers are in need of rest after active work and no
diving operations have been conducted since Monday evening, Russia
's Northern Fleet press service announced.
</P>
<P>
However, Russian and foreign ships are still staying in the
disaster area, waiting for further instructions to lift the Kursk
submarine from the seabed. Raising the bodies of the dead crewmen
from a depth of over 100 meters is practically impossible, a
spokesman for the Northern Fleet headquarters said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An attempt was made to extract the only body discovered so far
from the compartment nine Monday evening before the rescue was
suspended. It was conducted under the help of a Norwegian robotic
manipulator, but failed. The headquarters noted that it will be
possible to recover all the dead bodies from the submarine only
after it is shifted to shallow water.
</P>
<P>
The fleet press service said the directors of the rescue
operations have given up an intention to open the sub's
compartments seven and eight, which transpired and are filled with
water.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian ship Normand Pioneer with the British mini-
submarine LR5 on board has left the operation area, heading for
Norway. Meanwhile, the Norwegian ship Seaway Eagle with Norwegian
deep-water divers aboard is still staying in the distress waters.

<HEADLINE> Higher Court Upholds Verdict on Entrepreneur Charged with Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Hubei Provincial Higher People's
Court today rejected an appeal by Mou Qizhong, a businessman
charged with fraud, and upheld the verdict given to him at the
first-instance trial.
</P>
<P>
On May 30, Mou (previously spelt Mu) was sentenced by the
Intermediate People's Court of Wuhan City, Hubei province, to life
imprisonment for business fraud in a first-instance trial and was
also deprived of political rights for life. Mou was given a fine
of five million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Mou, 58, is the former president of the Land (also spelt Nande)
Economic Group, a large private company based in the port city of
Tianjin in north China. He used to be known as "the richest man"
in the Chinese mainland. However, his company had nearly collapsed
before he was detained on January 7,1999 and then arrested on
February 8 that year.
</P>
<P>
Mou was found guilty of signing false contracts. In order to
obtain financing from banks, he signed contracts with an
Australian company to import goods. However, there were no goods
to begin with.
</P>
<P>
Mou used the contracts to obtain letters of credit from a bank
in Hubei Province and withdrew more than 75 million US dollars
with the letters of credit. He used some 22 million US dollars of
the money to repay his company's debts. His fraudulent activities
caused losses of 35.5 million US dollars to the bank.
</P>
<P>
His three other complices were also sentenced on May 30. They
include Yao Hong and Mou Chen, both of whom got three years'
imprisonment and Mou Bo with two years in jail. Yao was also given
five years' probation and Mou Bo was given three years' probation.
</P>
<P>
After the first-instance trial, Mou Qizhong lodged an appeal
against the verdict to Hubei Provincial Higher People's Court.
After extensive investigations, the higher court concluded that
the punishment given to Mou Qizhong by the Intermediate People's
Court of Wuhan City is proper and should be carried out.

<HEADLINE> Slovakia, Slovenia Discuss Integration with EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard
Kukan and his visiting Slovenian counterpart Alojz Peterle agreed
on Monday that when the European Union will admit new members and
which country will join it first will depend on political factors
rather than economic ones.
</P>
<P>
Peterle told a press conference after talks with Kukan that the
EU should not drag its feet on its eastward expansion, on which
the final decision will be "stamped with the brand of politics."
</P>
<P>
Peterle expressed the hope that Slovenia and Solvakia would
strengthen cooperation in making preparations and becoming the
first countries to join the EU together with Poland, the Czech
Republic and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
Kukan said that while Slovakia is accelerating negotiations
with the EU in all fields, when it will join the EU should depend
on political factors.
</P>
<P>
The EU, and Central and East European countries have been at
odds over the timing of the eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
The Central and East European countries have asked the EU to
honor its promise to admit new members at the beginning of 2003,
while the EU insists that the expansion should be postponed
because the applicant countries failed to meet the requirements
set by it.
</P>
<P>
The EU commission said recently that the EU will accept new
members in 2005 at the earliest.

<P>
In the first six months of 2000, there were 23 percent more
workplace accidents (totaling of 1,418 cases) than in the same
period last year. These produced 1,479 victims, 17 percent more
than in the first half of 1999. Of which, 174 were killed and 443
people seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of the fatalities in the first half of the
year is slightly down on 1999's comparative period.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's main heavy industry hubs - Ho Chi Minh City, Hai
Phong, Quang Ninh, and Thai Nguyen - have the worst figures on
workplace injuries and fatalities.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of 2000, more than 10 billion
Vietnamese dong (VND) (714,286 U.S. dollars) was spent on labor
accident compensation compared with 13.216 billion VND (944,000 U.
S. dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
A number of experts here said that the real figures could be 10
times higher than those declared above.
</P>
<P>
According to the recent statistics of the Ministry of Labor,
War Invalids and Social Affairs, accidents caused by workers
violating regulations on technological safety accounted for 51.1
percent of the total labor accident cases, while 10.2 percent were
caused by poor working conditions with unsafe equipment.

<HEADLINE> DPRK, Japanese Negotiators Begin Normalization Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators from Japan and the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on Tuesday kicked off
their second round of talks on normalizing diplomatic ties between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK delegation is headed by Ambassador Jong Thae Hwa,
while the Japanese team is led by Kojiro Takano, ambassador in
charge of normalization talks.
</P>
<P>
Jong and Takano held the first round of talks in Pyongyang in
April, marking the resumption of the two countries' normalization
talks which collapsed in 1992 after eight rounds.
</P>
<P>
High on agenda are issues including Pyongyang's claim for
compensation for Japan's 1910-1945 colonial rule over the Korean
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
But Jong and Takano said Monday they will not ease their
positions, suggesting dim prospects for any breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Takano said he will try to lay the groundwork for
substantial negotiations at the third round of talks, expected
sometime in October in Beijing or another third-nation city.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the two sides will meet again in Kisarazu, Chiba
Prefecture, for the second day of talks.
</P>
<P>
While in Japan, the DPRK delegation is also scheduled to meet
with former Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama and Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) Secretary General Hiromu Nonaka.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK delegation, which arrived in Japan on Monday, will
head home on Friday morning.

<HEADLINE> Psychological Decompression Room Helps People Relieve from Depression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- This is like a scene from a
drama: a furious young lady, complaining loudly, smashes her enemy
in the head with a big hammer. Both the "enemy" and the hammer are
made of plastic.
</P>
<P>
A similar story like this is played out almost everyday, but
not on the stage, but in a small room at Lingdangge Community
Service Center in Tianjin, Beijing's neighboring municipality in
north China.
</P>
<P>
In this way people can release their psychological pressures in
the "psychological decompression room" at the community service
center.
</P>
<P>
The 40 square-meter room has seven compartments. Subdued light
shines in and fresh flowers heighten the relaxing atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Liu Qing, who is in charge of the center, said that people
today feel more pressure and are in great need of psychotherapy.
The decompression room is set to serve this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Some clients who have visited here said that they feel much
better after venting their penned up frustrations in such an
environment. They can discuss their troubles with the consultants
who will chat with them like old friends. In the clinics, however,
they are more likely to become nervous because of the "
professional" atmosphere there.
</P>
<P>
Since many of the clients are middle-aged and elderly people,
the community service center also invited some middle-aged laid-
off workers as visiting consultants.
</P>
<P>
Psychological problems such as anxiety and depression are the
biggest threat to the health of Chinese people, who usually pay
more attention to their physical health problems rather than the
psychological ones.
</P>
<P>
Depression is the No.1 psychological illness, according to some
Chinese and American psychiatrists. And suicide is the most
serious problem affecting people between the ages of 15 and 35.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more and more Chinese today are paying attention to
psychological health thanks to better standards of life and higher
levels of education.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey shows an increasing number of Chinese between
20 to 40 years of age are turning to psychologists for help and
guidance.

KUNMING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese border police have

</P>
<P>
Acting on a report of a local resident, border police and
public security officers carried out blanket search of a hill near
the checkpoint on August 12 and found two camouflage bags
containing 44 pieces of heroin weighing 23.27 kg.

The marine police also captured 1,150 "head-rocking pills", or

As RAC jet spewed fuel moments before it was to take King

the cabinet Sok An as temporary chairman of RAC.
</P>
<P>
On August 16, a RAC plane was found technical trouble shortly

<P>
It is high time for RAC to restructure, Sok An said.

"We need experience from big companies and human resources to

</P>
<P>
"Until today, (RAC) has not been strong and has not profited,"

<HEADLINE> Thailand to have Counter-Trade with ASEAN Oil Producing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The government is considering a
proposal that Thailand conduct counter-trade with oil producing
countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
and China in purchasing petroleum products from these countries,
the Thai News Agency (TNA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The country's private sector has proposed that the government
negotiate with ASEAN oil producing countries, including Brunei,
Indonesia, and Malaysia for the purchase of oil at friendship
prices, or on a counter-trade basis, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The counter-trade, which can also be extended to China, should
mainly be focused on exports of Thai agricultural products in
exchange for gasoline and other petroleum products from these
countries, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Thai farm exports could include rice, sugar, rubber, and
other key commodities.
</P>
<P>
The proposal should be pursued with other measures, namely
energy conservation campaigns and calls for major oil producing
countries to increase production, to ease difficulties of the Thai
public and manufacturers caused by the current oil price hike to a
recorded highest level, suggested the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Retail gasoline prices in Thailand have risen by 20 percent
since the beginning of this year due to a 13 percent increase in
crude oil prices in the world market and a five percent decline in
the value of Thai baht.
</P>
<P>
Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan has sent a letter to
member countries of the ASEAN and the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC), calling for a joint effort in signaling the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) impact of a
current oil-price surge on recovering economies in Asia, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Surin had also held talks with foreign ambassadors in Bangkok
to convey the same message concerning the hardship faced by poor
countries due to the oil price hike.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<P>
Quoting nearly two-year findings of an inquiry team headed by
Thai Air Force Chief-of-Staff Therdsak Sajjarak, it said," the
pilots did not see the runway when the plane was approaching the
airport because of bad weather."
</P>
<P>
When the pilots saw the runway as the plane was very close to
the airport, they descended suddenly but the plane was heading for
the control tower. "So they abruptly turned the plane which
consequently lost its balance and crashed," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The probe team will discuss the conclusion of the investigation
Thursday, together with representatives of the air force, the
Aviation Department and the national airline, it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials concerned met at the Transport Ministry
Monday, discussing plans on air safety, including a 2.9-billion-
baht (72 million U.S. dollars) project to enhance safety and

BUDAPEST, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian customs officers had

<HEADLINE> Bob Hasan May Not Join AAAA Congress: Indonesian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The presence of Asian Amateur
Athletics Association (AAAA) President Muhammad Bob Hasan of
Indonesia at a congress to elect a new president is in doubt due
to his detention in an Attorney General's Office cell here.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Amateur Athletics Association (PASI) Secretary-
General Tigor Tanjung said that Hasan's lawyer Hotma Sitompul had
requested the Attorney General's Office allow Hasan to be present
at the congress next month.
</P>
<P>
"We still haven't received any answer from the Attorney General
's Office. It will be really difficult if the AAAA president is
absent from the congress because he must give an accountability
report," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General's Office spokesman Yushar Yahya said that the
possibility of Hasan attending the congress was very slim.
</P>
<P>
"Probably he won't be able to attend the congress," Yahya said.
</P>
<P>
The AAAA statutes say that should the president be absent,
senior vice president Khalid bin Thani Al-Thani can replace him.
</P>
<P>
Hasan and four other candidates -- Al-Thani of Qatar, Eisa Al-
Dashti of Kuwait, Suresh Kalmadi of India and Muhammad Imtiaz Ali
of Pakistan -- are candidates for the next president for the 2000
to 2004 tenure.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Has Good Chance of Winning Olympic Golds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's success in winning
two titles in two five-star Grand Prix series badminton
tournaments has increased the country's optimism of bringing home
gold medals from the Olympic Games in Sydney next month.
</P>
<P>
The Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) Chairman Subagyo
Hadisiswoyo said that Taufik Hidayat, who won both the Indonesia
and Malaysia Open crowns, had a considerable chance of winning the
men's singles gold medal without pushing aside seniors Hendrawan
and Marlev Mainaky.
</P>
<P>
"With his victory in two consecutive tournaments, we are
optimistic that he, and his seniors, has a chance to win gold.
The success in the Thomas Cup championships in Kuala Lumpur in May
is also an indication of our chances," he was quoted by the
Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the Indonesia Open, Candra Wijaya and Tony Gunawan won the
men's doubles title while runners up Flandy Limpele and Eng Hian
managed to win the Malaysia Open title.
</P>
<P>
"Our chances in the men's doubles are also good. We all know
that the event has become our strength for some time since the
early 1990s," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Subagyo was pessimistic about Indonesia's chances in the
mixed doubles as Indonesia's number one duo of Tri Kusharyanto and
Minarti Timur failed to win the title, bowing out to Kim Dong-moon
and Ra Kyung-min of South Korea in the Malaysia Open final.
</P>
<P>
They also lost in the Indonesia Open semi-finals to eventual
winners Joanne Goode and Simon Archer of England.
</P>
<P>
PBSI training director Christian Hadinata said that Taufik had
shown great promise since the Thomas Cup.
</P>
<P>
"About two years ago, he trailed behind the top players. Now
he'll be the number one in the newest IBF (International Badminton
Federation) ranking list and he's the trailed. He must be
prepared for the situation," he added.

<HEADLINE> Official Urges Developing West China by Science, Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
has stressed the importance of developing the economically
backward western part of the country by giving top priority to
developing science, technology and education.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized the introduction of innovative conception,
new ways of thinking, updated mechanism and science and technology
in implementing the government's strategy to develop the
underdeveloped areas.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks during a study tour of Ningxia Hui and
Xinjiang Uygur autonomous regions, both in the northwest, from
August 14-21.
</P>
<P>
During his trip, the vice-premier talked with local leaders and
inspected a number of schools, research institutions, enterprises,
poverty-eradication projects, and water conservancy facilities.
</P>
<P>
He praised the efforts by local authorities to develop local
economy, consolidate unity among people of different ethnic groups,
and maintain social stability. All this has helped push ahead the
social progress in an all-about way, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the local people not to miss the historic
opportunities of launching the strategy to develop the west and
the new scientific and technological revolution in the new century.
Learning from the past, top priority must be given to developing
science, technology and education during the whole process of
developing the vast western areas, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
The development of the west calls for a high-quality personnel,
the development of science and technology, and the cultural and

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Former Military Commander Declared Suspect in E.Timor Melee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Former Armed Forces
Commander Gen. Wiranto has been suspected to be involved in the
violation of human rights which took place in the former
Indonesian province of East Timor, the Indonesian Observer daily
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Luhut Pangaribuan, a member of the expert team
from the probe into human rights violations in East Timor, the
findings announced by the Commission of Inquiry into Human Rights
Abuse in East Timor and the probe conducted by an expert team did
not differ in substance and recommendations.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto, a close aide of former president Soeharto, quitted as
Coordinating Minister for Political and Security Affairs in March
this year to facilitate the probe into the alleged human rights
violations in the former Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian military was accused of killing thousands of
people in East Timor before or after a direct ballot which led to
the breakaway of East Timor from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Pangaribuan also said that an international tribunal was an
alternative when it came to bring the alleged human rights
violators to justice.
</P>
<P>
The expert team of the Commission of Inquiry into Human Rights
Abuse in East Timor Monday held a meeting at the Attorney General
Office to discuss the legal basis to be applied to try the case,
he added.

<P>
YANGON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar produces 200,000 tons of
edible oil annually while importing 100,000 tons of such oil to
help fulfill its domestic demand, says the Myanmar Facts and
Figures booklet currently published by the country's Ministry of
Information.
</P>
<P>
In addition to cultivation of major oil crops such as groundnut,

<P>
Myanmar annually cultivates over 650,000 hectares of oil crops,
of which over 450,000 hectares are covered by groundnut, while
over 200,000 hectares by sunflower.
</P>
<P>
According to official disclosure, annual import of edible oil
is valued at 72.6 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
To gradually reduce the import of edible oil, Myanmar has
leased out large plots of vacant and virgin lands to private
entrepreneurs and provided the oil crop growers with agricultural
loans and advance payment for the purchase of the crops.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan government denied
on Monday to have any sort of agreement with Colombian rebel
groups, saying that it is only in its interest to collaborate in
Colombia's peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"I want to say in a clear and definite fashion, that there is
no agreement neither with ELN, nor with FARC," said Venezuela's
Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel in response to a statement by
the National Liberation Army (ELN), the second largest guerrilla
group in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
"There is no document, nor talks that could be considered as a
formal agreement between the Venezuelan government and these
guerrilla groups" from Colombia, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Commander Pablo", ELN head in the regions of Arauca, Boyaco
and Casanare, said in an interview released on Monday by the
Caracas newspaper "El Nacional" that the guerrilla group respects
the conditions of the non-aggression pact which holds with the
Venezuelan government.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader said the ELN is not involved in any kind of
criminal activity within Venezuelan territory, denying the rumors
that the guerrilla group is responsible for the kidnapping of the
Venezuelan entrepreneur Richard Boulton one month ago, whose
whereabouts are unknown.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela and Colombia share an extensive 2,219-kilometer
border, commonly known for kidnappings, blackmail, robbery and
drugs trafficking.

<HEADLINE> North-South Divide in Britain Predicted to Get Bigger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 21 (Xinhua) - A group of British leading
economists have predicted that England's north-south divide is set
to grow bigger this year.
</P>
<P>
The Oxford Economic Forecasting estimated that the southeastern
region of England outside London will see an economic growth of 3.
7 percent, and eastern England and greater London will have a
growth of 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the west Midlands economy is expected to grow by 2.8
percent and north-east England by 2.7 percent, the consultant
company added.
</P>
<P>
Trade Minister Richard Caborn said that the government admitted
there are regional differences but the gap is narrowing.
</P>
<P>
Last December, Prime Minister Tony Blair attempted to dispel
the image of a north-south divide when he conducted a two-day tour
of north-west England.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a visit to Manchester, Blair said the north-
south split is "an over-simplistic explanation of the problems
that regional economies face."
</P>
<P>
He said: "The real divide is between the haves and have-nots,
whatever part of the country you are in."
</P>
<P>
But, in April this year, his views were rebuffed by an all-
party select committee on education and employment, which said
there was still a distinctive north-south pattern.

BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Web surfers are being warned not
to send junk e-mail or they risk losing their accounts or being
penalized in other ways, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
In what appears to be the first such rules in the country, the
paper cited China Telecom as saying that special mailboxes will be
used to receive complaints from those who receive unsolicited
electronic mail.
</P>
<P>
Under the new provision, any subscriber using China Telecom
Internet Protocol network will be affected. They will be warned,
or have their service suspended or permanently terminated, if they
are found to have sent unwanted e-mail which annoys other users or
affects the performance of the network.
</P>
<P>
In the worst cases, China Telecom has warned it will pass on
user details to law-enforcement bodies for investigation,
according to the provisions, which were published in major Chinese
newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations, dial-up users will be warned and
afterwards put on a monitoring list for three days following
complaints against them. If they ignore it and go on sending junk
e-mail, their accounts will be suspended or closed down.
</P>
<P>
The paper cited Chang Xiaobing, vice-president of China Telecom,
as saying that it was impossible to completely block the
transmission of junk e-mail with the existing technology, so the
ultimate solution was to bring in anti-spam laws.

<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- China's historic and cultural
relics will be better protected and properly utilized during the
development of the country's western regions, government officials
have vowed.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Xinmiao, deputy head of the State Bureau of Cultural
Relics, said that his bureau would increase investment in cultural
relics protection in the west of the country.
</P>
<P>
The bureau is now studying the situation to determine how much
cash will be needed, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Having a population of about 370 million, Western China covers
the provinces of Shaanxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Gansu, Sichuan and
Qinghai, the autonomous regions of Tibet, Ningxia, Xinjiang,
Guangxi and Inner Mongolia, and Chongqing Municipality.
</P>
<P>
Many parts of the region have a great number of historical
sites, including the ancient capital of Xi'an, Gansu's Dunhuang
and Chongqing's Dazu, both famous for their Buddhist relics.
</P>
<P>
However, current protection measures in the west are not
sufficient to manage the vast number of sites and relics in the
area, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Early last month, a six-story stupa was stolen in Gansu
Province, and Dunhuang's Buddhist frescoes have been seriously
damaged over the years due to the number of visitors.
</P>
<P>
Zheng stressed that historical sites and relics in the west
must be used according to their specific nature. And he
recommended to limit the number of visitors to some sites.
</P>
<P>
Wang Honghua, director of Chongqing Cultural Bureau echoed the
Zheng's view to acknowledge that the need to protect the area's
historical sites is urgent.
</P>
<P>
The municipality has rescued more than 12,000 cultural relics
since the Three Gorges Project began, Wang added.

AMMAN -- Jordan will continue to promote the Middle East peace
process but firmly rejects Israeli sovereignty over the holy city
of Jerusalem, Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul Ilah Khatib said
here on Monday.

<P>
Answering an inquiry from members of the Palestinian Affairs
Committee of the House of Representatives (lower house), Khatib

decided in accordance with resolutions of the United Nations.

Jerusalem belongs to the Arab and Muslim world and the holy city
should be handed over to the Palestinian National Authority, the

measures Barak would take against the two parties include

URUMQI, August 22 (Xinhua) -- China plans to repair a group of
historical sites in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
The Beiting West Temple, the Kizil One-Thousand Buddha Caves
and the Kumutula Grottoes are included in the renovation project.
</P>
<P>
The Beiting West Temple, 700 meters from the ruins of the
ancient city of Beiting, is an imperial temple built and used
during the mid 10th century and the mid 13th century. The mud-
brick building features well designed Buddha figures, fresco and
sculptures reflecting that period of time.

In another development, Beiting City, which is more than 2,000
years old, will also undergo a facelift soon. Beiting was a famous
city on the ancient Silk Road and had been used as an important

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Sierra Leonean government
Monday said the main rebel movement in the country, the
Revolutionary United Front (RUF), now has a new leader to succeed
the detained Foday Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
The British Broadcast Corporation (BBC) quoted a Sierra Leonean
governmental statement as saying that the new leader is Issa Sesay,
RUF's battlefield commander since his predecessor Sam Bockarie
went to Liberia last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the Sierra Leonean government
obtained information from a source closing to Nigerian President
Olusegun Obasanjo and the Mali President Alpha Konare, who are now
in Sierra Leone on a peace mission.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leonean government also plans to release some 170
RUF fighters in what it called the interests of a sustainable
peace, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh, founder of the RUF, launched the civil war in Sierra
Leone in 1991. After being captured in May, he is now being held
in government custody at an unknown location and will face trial
for human rights offenses.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council has recently approved the
establishment of a court to try war criminals in Sierra Leone.

HAVANA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Cuban authorities decreed Tuesday
a state of alert for its eastern provinces of Holguin, Guantanamo
and Las Tunas, situated in Hurricane Debby's eventual path.

<P>
A note from Cuba's Civil Defense Staff declared an informative
phase for central Camaguey and Ciego de Avila provinces and kept

<HEADLINE> Mandelson Meets Security Chiefs on Escalating Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary Peter Mandelson met the security chiefs Tuesday to
discuss the escalating violence between the province's two main
pro-British Protestant paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson and his security chiefs made no comment after their
meeting. Although behind-the-scenes attempts were being made to
get the rival organizations to negotiate some sort of truce,
political representatives ruled out any early talks.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came after two men were shot dead Monday in an
escalation of a dispute between the pro-British Ulster Volunteer
Force (UVF) and the Ulster Defense Association (UDA).
</P>
<P>
Monday night was a mainly trouble-free, but there was a tense
atmosphere on the streets of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The two dead men, Jackie Coulter, a prominent member of the UDA,
and Robbie Mahood, were shot on the Crumlin Road in north Belfast
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, crowds attacked the Shankill Road offices of the
Progressive Unionist Party (PUP), which has links with the UVF,
and a taxi in separate incidents.
</P>
<P>
The police arrested a number of people and seized arms.
</P>
<P>
The shootings followed a weekend of tension between the rival
loyalist paramilitaries on the Shankill Road.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson said the latest outbreak of violence had "nothing to
do with politics" but was a result of "squalid murderous gang
warfare."
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Mandelson decided to step up security by resuming
army patrols in some parts of Belfast and increasing the police
presence on the streets.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of feuding loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland
were urged to agree to a mediation process in a bid to stop their
shooting war escalating into a full-scale bloodbath.
</P>
<P>
With dozens of police and troops on the streets of Belfast to
keep the rival UDA and UVF factions apart, politicians on all
sides, including Sinn Fein, called for an end to the violence.
</P>
<P>
Gary McMichael, leader of the Ulster Democratic Party, the UDA'
s political wing, said, "This infighting is tearing loyalism apart.
Those involved should take stock of the implications of continued
internecine violence and realize that they are on a road to
nowhere. "
</P>
<P>
Billy Hutchinson of the Progressive Unionist Party, the UVF's
political wing, said mediation talks would have to get under way
at some stage. "No matter how many people die, sooner or later
people will talk. We have to find a mediator who is respected on
both sides."
</P>
<P>
Mitchel McLaughlin, Sinn Fein's national chairman, said, "The
leaderships of these loyalist organizations must get their act
together. They must assert discipline within their groups and end
this shooting war."

<HEADLINE> S&AMP;P's Analysis: Asian Auto Industry in Recovery Mode </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Asia will account for a
growing proportion of global auto industry demand and production
for the future, but the short-term picture remains less buoyant,
according to a report released Tuesday by Standard and Poor's.
</P>
<P>
In the next decade, vehicle demand in Asia, excluding Japan, is
expected to increase at a compound average annual rate of 8.3
percent to reach 14.8 million units in 2010, the report said. By
2010, Asia, excluding Japan, will account for 20 percent of global
demand excluding Africa and the Middle East. Including Japan, the
region's share of global sales is expected to be 30 percent in
2010.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said, demand still struggles from the blow
the region received with the economic crisis of the late 1990s.
Doubts are beginning to reappear about the sustainability of the
recovery.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, total vehicle demand in Asia had declined 18.3 percent
to 10.9 million units. The recovery in 1999 was impressive, with
total demand rising by 9.5 percent to 11.9 million units. While
Japan, the region's largest market, continued to stagnate in 1999,
South Korea registered big gains, with sales rising by 493,000
units and production by 888,000 units. Thailand, Malaysia, India
and China also held up well.
</P>
<P>
Total vehicle demand in Asia is expected to reach 12.7 million
units this year, up 7.2 percent from 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Japan's role in Asia is reducing and
in 1999, non-Japanese vehicle demand exceeded Japanese demand. By
2005, sales in non-Japanese Asia are expected to be 9.9 million
units compared to Japanese demand of 6.9 million units. By 2010,
two-thirds of all vehicle sales in Asia will be outside of Japan.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Welcomes Zimbabwe's Crackdown on Farm Squatters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government Wednesday applauded Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
for his crackdown on illegal land occupation.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet spokesman Joel Netshitenze told reporters in Pretoria
that "developments in the last 48 hours do demonstrate that they
were committed to what they had indicated to our delegation."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a promise made by Mugabe to South African
President Thabo Mbeki that war veterans would be removed from
white-owned farms.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki met with Mugabe in Harare on August 2, and Mugabe
announced after the meeting that his government would remove war
veterans from hundreds of white-owned farms and resettle them to
land acquired by the government within the coming four weeks.
</P>
<P>
Since February this year, about 1,600 white-owned farms have
been occupied by veterans who urged the government to speed up a
program to redistribute land from whites to landless black
peasants.
</P>
<P>
According to Netshitenze, Zimbabwean police began a crackdown
on squatters Monday and Tuesday as an "implementation of the
undertaking to the South African delegation of the eviction of
those who are occupying farms that have not been designated."
</P>
<P>
The police demolished shacks built by war veterans on land
south of Harare and parceled out to homeless urban dwellers, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the South African cabinet has agreed that its ministers
will continue to meet with their Zimbabwean counterparts in a bid
to help its northern neighbor.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Not to Repudiate Foreign Debt: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Minister of Foreign
Affairs Alhaji Sule Lamido has ruled out the repudiation of the
country's foreign debt, saying this would amount to a breach of
its international obligation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to media on Wednesday in the capital Abuja, Lamido
said as a "responsible member of the international community and
with the tremendous respect it enjoys within this community",
Nigeria could not afford to repudiate its foreign debt, which is
estimated at 30 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The present administration would continue to discuss with the
creditor countries about the virtue of debt forgiveness, despite
of the prevailing negative attitude among them, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"We want them to understand that this is the only way to ensure
a secure, prosperous and contented Africa which would help promote
world peace and continue to provide a ready market for their
exports," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's democratically-elected government of President
Olusegun Obasanjo has been campaigning for debt forgiveness since
its inception last May, arguing that this would enable it to
deliver the dividends of democracy.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's New Political Bureau to Be Appointed: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the ruling
Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-pf)
Wednesday said the new political bureau will not be elected, but
be appointed by First Secretary and Party President Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Administration Diydmus Mutasa told the Zimbabwe
News Agency that no amendments have been made to the party's
constitution to provide for the elections at the special congress
set for December this year.
</P>
<P>
The new political bureau was not appointed at the party's fifth
national congress last year as members failed to agree on whether
Mugabe should continue appointing the members instead of them
being elected.
</P>
<P>
This would be the first time a special congress is called to
announce the political bureau. In the past, Mugabe would announce
the new members before the close of the national congress.
</P>
<P>
"The constitution is not yet changed," Mutasa said. "Everything
will be done according to the constitution and President Mugabe
will appoint the political bureau members."
</P>
<P>
According to the Zimbabwe News Agency, some other issues like
the endorsement of constitutional changes to allow a one-third
quota system of allocating positions to women would be on the
agenda of the special congress.
</P>
<P>
There was speculation that the special congress might consider
the issue of choosing a successor to Mugabe who is widely believed
to be considering to resign before the 2002 presidential election.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Prohibits Police Moonlighting for Private Security Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 23 (Xinhua) -- South African Cabinet
Wednesday approved a bill to regulate private security companies
and stop police from moonlighting for them.
</P>
<P>
It is vital that private security companies act in accordance
with the Constitution, South African Safety and Security Minister
Steve Tshwete told reporters after a cabinet meeting in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
"They (the private security companies) have more men and women
under arms than we have in the police service," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tshwete pointed out that it is a bad practice for police to
earn extra money by doing night duty for private security
companies.
</P>
<P>
"It adds to the stress levels they are experiencing," he said.
"You find that police officers doing that kind of moonlighting get
involved in ugly incidents."
</P>
<P>
This is neither in the interest of the police nor that of the
private security industry, the minister emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft legislation, members of the South African
National Defense Force will also not be allowed to work as private
security officers.
</P>
<P>
The bill will be tabled during the upcoming South African
parliamentary session.

<HEADLINE> WB Approves 60 Million U.S. Dollars Credit to Tanzanian Poor Communities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has
approved a 60 million U.S. dollars credit to help Tanzanian poor
communities improve and sustain socioeconomic services and
opportunities, according to a statement issued here on Wednesday
by the World Bank country office.
</P>
<P>
The fund will be administered by the Tanzania Social Action
Fund Project, which aims to reduce the devastating effects of
poverty by providing opportunities for communities to participate
in and take charge of key decision-making processes at the local
level, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said the fund will finance and support small demand-based
community initiatives in the social sectors that improve the
access to and delivery of social and economic services such as
health centers, school buildings, shallow wells, crop storage
facilities and markets.
</P>
<P>
"The project activities are designed to improve basic services
and protect vulnerable groups through community development
initiatives, public works program and institutional development,"
the document said.
</P>
<P>
Specific attention will also be given to HIV/AIDS prevention
programs, it added.
</P>
<P>
The credit, which is given by the International Development
Association, the World Bank's lending arm for the poorest
countries, is on standard terms of 40 years maturity, including 10
years grace.
</P>
<P>
Recent poverty data from the World Bank indicate that about
half of all Tanzanians live in poor households where each person
earns less than one dollar a day. Poverty is particularly
widespread in the countryside as almost 61 percent of the rural
population is poor compared to 39 percent of the urban population.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba Urges More Right for People in Angola, Congo to Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba said warring factions in Angola and the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) should guarantee the promotion of
democratic principles under which all their people should be
included in the decision making process, Zambia News Agency
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Where citizens have been brought on board in the decision
making process, there will be little need for recourse to coercive
means of attaining political power," Chiluba said in Gaborone,
Botswana, on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who is paying a four-day state visit to Botswana, said
conditions for peace and economic activity would remain illusive
if the people of the two countries had no say in determining their
political and economic destiny.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian president said it was regrettable that the two
countries were still caught in conflicts at a time when Africa and
the Southern African region in particular should be concentrating
their efforts on combating the challenges of globalization,
poverty, unemployment and the HIV/AIDS pandemic.
</P>
<P>
He, however, said it was his sincere hope that the parties
involved in the conflicts in the two nations would sooner or later
fulfil all their obligations under the respective peace agreements
to pave the way for peace in each country.
</P>
<P>
On Angola, Chiluba reaffirmed Zambia's commitment to the search
for a peaceful and lasting solution to the conflict in that
country.
</P>
<P>
"We support and fully adhere to international efforts aimed at
tightening the sanctions regime against the National Union for
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)," said the president.

LUSAKA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba has invited the Botswanan business community to invest in
his country's tourism and agriculture sectors, the Zambia News
Agency reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Zambia is keen to share experiences with Botswana in these two
sectors and could also take advantage of the abundant arable land

He said the potential for enhancing economic cooperation
between the two countries was vast, adding that there was still
room for increased investment cooperation in areas such as animal
husbandry production and the tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
The president said Zambia derived a lot of inspiration and
encouragement from Botswana's economic success which had play a
model role in sub-Sahara Africa in general and Southern Africa
region in particular.
</P>
<P>
"There is need for us in the Southern African sub-region to
vigorously pool our resources, skills and markets to withstand the
adverse effects of globalization and ensure prosperity and an
improvement in the quality of life of our people," Chiluba said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Any one in possession of
dye-stained bank notes could be carrying worthless money for which
there will be no compensation, the Banking Council of South Africa
(BCSA) announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The council said in a statement that the Reserve Bank (central
bank) of South Africa has decided to declare any such notes non-
legal tender.
</P>
<P>
For security reasons, most banks use cash boxes with a dye
mechanism to stain bank notes which in the case of a robbery will
be triggered as stolen money.
</P>
<P>
According to BCSA spokeswoman Adri Grobler, all banks have
been notified that the Reserve Bank would with immediate effect no
longer accept dye-stained notes from the institutions.
</P>
<P>
"The public should take note of this, and should take care to
check that they are not being given dye-stained notes by any
person or business as they could be the proceeds of crime," she
said.
</P>
<P>
She said the dye, which is normally pink, orange, blue or red,
could either be over the entire surface, around the edges or on
any part of the note.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman disclosed that special arrangements have been
made for banks to recover from the Reserve Bank the value of notes
dye-stained, provided the notes have remained continuously under
their control.

DAR ES SALAAM, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The value of Tanzania's
exports recorded a 2.3 percent increase to 42.4 million U.S.
dollars in June this year from 41.4 million dollars in May, the
Central Bank of Tanzania said in its latest monthly economic
review.
</P>
<P>
However, its imports witnessed a 25.5 percent decrease over the
same comparison.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, the exports of non-traditional
commodities including minerals and manufactured goods increased
from 26.9 million dollars in May to 33.4 million dollars in June.
</P>
<P>
But, traditional exports declined from 14.5 million dollars to
8.9 million dollars, which is mainly due to the weak world market
prices combined with declining export volumes, the review says.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the review shows imports of different items
decreased by 25.5 percent in June to 108.5 million dollars from
145.7 million dollars recorded during the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Oil imports decreased by 54.2 percent to 8 million dollars in
June from 17.3 million dollars in May due to a significant
decrease in volume.
</P>
<P>
Imports of food and foodstuffs also declined because it is
currently in the harvesting season in most of the cereal producing
areas in the country, added the report.

LUANDA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government has set up
an inter-ministerial commission specialized in combating dire
poverty in the war-torn southwestern African country, an official
document said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest edition of the government's gazette,
this inter-ministerial commission is currently responsible for
drawing up a provisional document on strategies to reduce poverty.
</P>
<P>
The gazette noted that this move followed a monitored accord
signed between the Angolan government and the International

</P>
<P>
The commission, which is to be coordinated by the Angolan Vice
Minister for Planning Eduardo Severim de Morais, is in charge of
surveying a set of related studies on the issue and assessing all
existing strategies on reducing poverty.
</P>
<P>
When needed, the poverty-eliminating commission will summon
representatives of some professional organizations, employers'
associations, churches and non-governmental organizations for a
participative discussion on the situation of the civil society.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan Ministry for Planning announced in late July that
some 67 percent of the Angolan population are suffering from dire
poverty, with 11 percent of them in utterly destitute.

contributed to the reduction of HIV infection rate.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is one of a few countries in Africa which have achieved
success in fighting against the killer disease. The success is
also attributed to the enhanced awareness of the ordinary people
in the east Africa country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warns Against High Expectations Upon Clinton's Nigeria Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government has advised
Nigerians against an "exaggerated expectation" on this week's
visit of President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Susan Rice, the U.S. Assistant Secretary for African Affairs,
Tuesday told Nigerian press via internet link that the complete
debt cancellation is "difficult to achieve".
</P>
<P>
Describing Nigeria a country "too rich to be poor, and too poor
to be rich", she said in Washington via web that Nigeria is not
eligible for the Highly Indebted Poor Country Initiative".
</P>
<P>
Noting only less than four percent of Nigeria's debt is owed to
the U.S., she however pledged that the U.S. will help Nigeria to
reschedule its staggering 30 billion U.S. dollar debt to make it "
manageable" and "not overly extraordinary".
</P>
<P>
But she also stressed that any debt relief is possible only in
the context that the reduced debt becomes investment in the
welfare of average Nigerians and the reduction is carried out in a
credit worthy way.
</P>
<P>
She said the U.S. has already increased its aid to Nigeria from
7 million dollars in 1998 to about 109 million in 2000, making the
country "by far the largest development partner in Africa."

<HEADLINE> Tea Demand Low at Kenya's Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Activity slowed at Kenya's tea
auction this week due to lower demand, undermining prices for most
grades except the top ones, the East African Standard newspaper
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Top grades gained up to 10 U.S. cents per kg but mediums and
other lower grades were quoted softer.
</P>
<P>
"There was less and selective demand," Africa Tea Brokers said
in their weekly report.
</P>
<P>
Traders reported reduced demand from British, Pakistani, Yemeni
and Afghan buyers.
</P>
<P>
"This was a down market. We hope the prices will improve next
week," one trader said, adding that some buyers were finding
Kenyan prices high compared with other markets.
</P>
<P>
Prices rose at last week's auction, lifted by the return of
Egyptian buyers after a trade dispute between Nairobi and Cairo
was resolved.
</P>
<P>
Kenya, one of three largest black tea producers in the world,
exported 241,700 tons of tea to more than 40 countries.

genocide has made the region attract worldwide attention. We are
interested in finding the causes of the conflicts and coming out
with solutions," said Kabwegyere.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper report, high profile guests will
include former South African president Nelson Mandela, former
president of Botswana Masire Ketumile and Organization of African

<HEADLINE> Starving Wild Animals Invade Farms in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Hungry wild animals escaping
drought and famine in the vast Aberdare and Mt. Kenya national
parks in central Kenya have invaded people's farms destroying
crops and killing farmers, the East African Standard newspapers
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The animals including elephants and buffaloes have caused
massive destruction of food crops in parts of Nyeri District in
Central Province as the country is experiencing a prolonged
drought.
</P>
<P>
At the weekend, a 60-year-old farmer was trampled to death by
elephants which raided his farm in Sagana Village at the edge of
Mt. Kenya forest.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a herd of buffaloes attacked and seriously injured
two young men whom they encountered in Naro Moru division. The two
were admitted at Provincial General Hospital at Nyeri town in
critical condition.
</P>
<P>
Senior Warden Ibrahinm Rubia of the Aberdare National Park said
upon receiving the report of the buffalo attack, he immediately
sent some wardens in search of the animals and killed one buffalo
after it turned very violent.
</P>
<P>
Rubia explained that the animals in the national parks were
escaping the ravaging drought and their search for food was
leading them to people's farms.

<HEADLINE> Changes Introduced in Kenya's Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Major changes have been
introduced in Kenya's military, including pegging future
promotions to academic performance and allowing women soldiers to
marry, the Daily Nation newspapers reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Officers will be required to undergo university level education
to be considered for promotion under a new mandatory scheme which
took effect in July this year.
</P>
<P>
The changes were approved in May by the Defense Council, the
country's highest decision-making organ on military affairs other
than the presidency.
</P>
<P>
To get promotion, officers now must earn certificates, diplomas,
bachelors and masters degrees in courses on military science
currently offered only at Egerton University in Nakuru, a city in
central Kenya.
</P>
<P>
They will be implemented in phases for the next 11 years until
July 1, 2012, when no major will be promoted to lieutenant-colonel
without having earned a masters degree in military science.
</P>
<P>
Under the changes, women soldiers and officers are now free to
marry either civilians or soldiers, following the integration of
the former Women Service Corp into other formations of the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
The changes are to replace the earlier one where officers and
soldiers had to volunteer for practical examinations set by the
military or undergo specialized training abroad as one of the
considerations to promotion.
</P>
<P>
It is also to avoid the tribalism, nepotism and party
affiliation which are sometimes felt to have influenced promotions.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Army Seeks More Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government should
increase the defense budget to improve the performance of the
Uganda People's Defense Forces, Army Chief of Logistics Fred
Bogere has said at the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
"We are in a dilemma. The situation is quite alarming. Until
the Ministry of Finance approves our budget as we present it, our
performance will remain minimal," Bogere told the parliament
committee on defense and internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said they had budgeted for 400 billion Uganda shillings (
about 250 million U.S. dollars) but were asked by the Ministry of
Finance to scale it down to 191 billion shillings, according to a
Wednesday report of the New Vision newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Bogere said 59 percent of this would be spent on wages and the
remaining 41 percent on welfare and others.
</P>
<P>
Edith Mwanje, undersecretary in the Ministry of Finance, said
however that budgets in all sectors were cut.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Rise Mostly on Steady Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks moved higher
Tuesday after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged as
most analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 59.34 at 11,139.15
points. The blue chip index gained 33.33 points Monday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The technology
heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 5.06 at 3,958.21 points and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 1.35 at 1,498.13.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve announced its decision to stay on hold
after a meeting on rates today but warned that it may need to
raise rates later if price pressures build.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts had expected the central bank to leave rates
alone because recent reports showed that the U.S. economy is
slowing and inflation remains tame. The Federal Reserve has raised
rates six times in the past 14 months in an effort to cool off the
economy enough to prevent inflation from rising.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve's next meeting is in early October.
Analysts believed that in a presidential election year, an autumn
rate hike right before voters go to the polls is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
Most banking and retail stocks rose on the rate decision. Among
them were J.P. Morgan and the Gap.
</P>
<P>
In the tech sectors, most software and computer stocks gained
while shares of semiconductor and telecommunications fell after a
strong rally in the previous sessions.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 0.46 at 671.62 and the American Stock
Exchange index was up 2.23 at 922.75. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 1.01 at 517.46.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a slender margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,465 up, 1,341 down and 583
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 815.10 million shares from 726.38
million in the previous session.
