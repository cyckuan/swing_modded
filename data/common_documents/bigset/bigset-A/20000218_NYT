COMMENTARY: AMERICA'S RAGS-TO-RICHES MYTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans cling to the conceit that they have unrivaled
opportunity to move up and, alas, down the income ladder. This
notion, that families that occupy the bottom rungs of the income
ladder readily exchange places with those that occupy higher rungs,
breeds indifference to the most glaring economic fact of the past
quarter-century: widening inequality. The gap in earnings, for
example, between college and high school graduates more than
doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in a recent Op-Ed piece in The New York Times, W. Michael
Cox and Richard Alm acknowledge that the wealth of poor families
has been falling at the same time that the wealth of rich families
has been rising, and ask, ``So what?''
</P>
<P>
   Cox and Alm suggest that mobility along the income ladder is
serving as an antidote to inequality. But exactly how much mobility
is there? According to them, quite a lot. ``America isn't a caste
society,'' they say, citing a study by the Federal Reserve that
shows that only 5 percent of the poorest 20 percent of people
stayed in that lowest income group over a 17-year period. Everyone
else moved higher.
</P>
<P>
   But this stunning statistic is stunningly misleading. Prof.
Peter Gottschalk of Boston College points out that the Fed study
counts teen-agers and young adults from upper-income families who
work part time while in school as moving upward when they find
higher-paying jobs after graduation. This upward mobility of
students hardly answers the enduring question: How many grown-ups
are trapped in low-paying jobs?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is, a lot. America's conceit is just that _ a
conceit.
</P>
<P>
   Gottschalk and Prof. Sheldon Danziger of the University of
Michigan have looked at the plight of children during the 1970s and
80s. They separate children into five groups according to their
family's income. About 6 in 10 of the children in the lowest group
_ the poorest 20 percent _ in the early 1970s were still in the
bottom income group 10 years later. Almost 9 in 10 children in the
bottom group remained in the bottom two income groups 10 years
later. Neither of these figures budged in the 1980s, providing
solid evidence that mobility did not rise over the 20-year period.
About 70 percent of poor black children in the early 1970s were
still poor a decade later.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that few families occupying the low rungs of
America's income ladder get rich.
</P>
<P>
   Economists provide no rule for figuring out how much mobility a
society needs to counter the impact of any given amount of
inequality. But there is indirect evidence that mobility is not
high enough in this country to provide an adequate safety valve for
those on the bottom rungs. Even if mobility was high enough 30
years ago to justify a so-what attitude toward inequality, it seems
improbable that it could be high enough today, given that mobility
has remained constant but inequality has reached extreme levels.
Another sobering indicator: mobility is no higher in the United
States than in Western Europe, where living standards are
comparable and there is only a fraction as much inequality.
</P>
<P>
   Some inequality is essential for capitalism. High incomes are
the reward for studying long hours, working hard and investing in
risky businesses. But high incomes can result for reasons that have
little to do with merit, reflecting rich parents, luck or
manipulation of the political process. Inequality driven by such
factors can breed social division, anger and a politics of
resentment. It also belies the notion that America gives everyone a
fair chance.
</P>
<P>
   Economists are in general reluctant to tamper with market-driven
incomes. The risk of squashing incentives and innovation can be
great. But there is a compelling case for eradicating one virulent
form of inequality: poverty. The richest country in the history of
the universe tolerates a poverty rate of about 20 percent among its
children, and about 35 percent among its black children. No conceit
about mobility, real or imagined, can excuse that unconscionable
fact.

   Sen. John McCain began running this 30-second television
commercial Thursday in South Carolina. It is titled ``Can Win.''
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Stevens Reed Curcio &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN:
</P>
<P>
   With dramatic theme music in the background, a series of clips
show McCain campaigning before cheering crowds. The words
``character,'' ``courage,'' ``ready to lead'' and ``vote John
McCain for president'' flash on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   TEXT:
</P>
<P>
   Announcer: ``John McCain. The character to do what's right.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain: ``I'm going to give the government back to you, and I
promise you that.''
</P>
<P>
   Announcer: ``The courage to fight for it. A Republican like
Ronald Reagan who can win.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain: ``I'm going to beat Al Gore like a drum. You will always
hear the truth from me, no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   Announcer: ``This Saturday, vote John McCain for president.''
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD:
</P>
<P>
   This is the first new commercial McCain has put on the air since
he vowed not to run more advertisements attacking Gov. George W.
Bush. It focuses on the two main points McCain now emphasizes in
his campaign: his character and, by invoking former President
Ronald and Gore, the likely Democratic nominee, his ability to win
by attracting independent and Democratic voters. It is the first
time one of McCain's television advertisements has mentioned
Reagan.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sam Osman, who emerged from the throng of pushcart
peddlers on the Lower East Side of Manhattan to become the founder
of Job Lot Trading, a legendary emporium with a staggeringly
unpredictable mix of ultracheap merchandise, died Tuesday at a
Manhattan hospital, his son Robby said. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Osman made Job Lot a pioneer, one imitated by Odd Job and Odd
Lot, among others, in the idiosyncratic, competitive business of
feeding off capitalism's castoffs. Job Lot's merchandise included
thousands upon thousands of items from unsuccessful sales
promotions, salvage merchandise from ships and goods bought from
bankrupt companies and U.S. Customs Service auctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business is other people's mistakes,'' Osman once said.
</P>
<P>
   All the mistakes were magically transformed into potentially
attractive merchandise by tagging them with low prices. Like the
times Osman was able to snag 50,000 or so name-brand handballs. He
would offer them for a dime at a time when more conventional stores
wanted $1.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd start making up reasons to buy handballs,'' said his son
Robby, who lives in Oakland, Calif. ``Or you'd kick yourself for
having missed it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was impulse shopping at its most impulsive, with nobody being
sure whether the lure was the rock-bottom prices or never knowing
what would be on sale. On any given day, bargains might range from
fishing poles to perfume, toboggan wax to musical piggy banks. An
employee once said the only items Job Lot had not sold were houses,
cars and airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Osman was born on June 18, 1911, to immigrant parents, and found
his first job at 15 in a sweatshop. He had been held back in school
for two years and dropped out in eighth grade. ``Teachers then did
not understand learning disabilities,'' he once wrote in a letter
to a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Soon he was peddling from a pushcart on Orchard Street on the
Lower East Side.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did people like me do _ people who had limited
opportunity for employment?'' he wrote. ``Some resorted to selling
drugs, others to grinding out a living with a pushcart. So off I
went with mine.''
</P>
<P>
   He breathed a sigh of relief when he finally got a license and
was able to peddle legally. He always called the certificate his
Harvard diploma.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no idea what a thrill it was to get that license,''
he told The New York Times Magazine in 1980. ``Before then I was a
`floater.' I'd go out every morning like a gladiator, with my heart
throbbing, wondering where I was going to stay, who I was going to
have to fight to move over, whether the cops would chase me. But
that license entitled me to two and a half yards of designated
space on Orchard Street. I could earn maybe $4 or $5 a day. I had
it made.''
</P>
<P>
   Osman opened a small basement store on Allen Street on the Lower
East Side in the 1930s, and about 1950, he opened Job Lot Trading
Co. at 41 Vesey St., near City Hall, and later another store, The
Pushcart, next door.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, construction of the World Trade Center forced him to
move the stores to the corner of Warren and Church Streets, where
he connected four buildings and splashed the facade with
eye-catching painted squares. The names of the two stores were
combined, Job Lot Trading Co./The Pushcart.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds at his stores would include clerks from City Hall,
secretaries from Wall Street law firms, families from Chinatown and
area office workers. During the December holidays, Osman would hire
security guards to keep the crowds in line as they waited to enter.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good store will do $200 to $300 of business in a square foot
of selling space in a year,'' Osman said in the 1980 magazine
interview with New York Times reporter Edwin McDowell. ``We do
better than $1,200 a square foot _ or close to $16 million a
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Osman and his wife, Eve, were active in civil rights and civil
liberties causes. He is survived by her; another son, Donny, who
lives in Plainfield, Vt., and one grandson.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Osman wrote an impassioned letter to Newsday to protest
a city crackdown on peddlers. ``Here is a city plagued by 2,000
murders a year, tens of thousands of guns on the streets and
insufficient housing for our homeless; a city stricken with AIDS,
drugs, incidents of ethnic and racial violence almost daily, yet
essential resources and money are being directed to go after
... &UR; peddlers &LR; ? This is absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Osman sold his business in the early 1980s. The downtown store
was closed in 1993; successors to his business, for whom he worked
as a consultant, opened and closed another, on Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many businessmen who resent peddlers for congesting
sidewalks and not paying taxes, Osman said he was thrilled when a
hot dog vendor showed up in front of his Warren and Church Streets
store the day it opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I was like a big horse with a big bag of oats and little
sparrows eating off my crumbs,'' he said.

BANKING INQUIRY'S TANGLED WEB REACHES LOFTY LEVELS IN MOSCOW
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds.: Subs for rewriting throughout; story is now complete in 1
take) 
 (js) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a city where banks sprout like mushrooms, and die
just as fast, the money-moving network described in the unfolding
Bank of New York case quickly branches into a web of control and
ownership. Some strands reach to the highest levels of Russian
finance and government.
</P>
<P>
   And adding to the flavor, the two Moscow banks that figure
prominently in the accounts of Lucy Edwards and Peter Berlin _ the
couple who pleaded guilty in New York on Wednesday, opening a new
window in the case _ were not really banks at all, according to
Russian bankers and U.S. investigators.
</P>
<P>
   They were front companies that allowed ingenious schemes for
funneling money out of Russia beneath the radar of customs and tax
officials, and into one of three accounts set up at the Bank of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Such specialty banks are a key element of the economic chaos
that resulted from the disintegration of the Soviet system. The
most rudimentary mechanisms and controls were absent, and winners
emerged with huge holdings and fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Some entities belong to a single company or industry that needs
a special line of credit, and are called pocket banks. Others are
political banks, born of the embrace between Russian business and
government. And sorting out which is which and who owns what is an
accountant's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, according to documents filed Wednesday in New
York, the two banks prominently mentioned by Edwards and Berlin,
Flamingo and DKB, were the children of two other banks, MDM and
Sobinbank, which enjoyed the backing of well-connected patrons in
Moscow, some with close ties to the Kremlin, others to Moscow City
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Sobinbank was no phony institution. Founded in 1990, it had a
lobby and customers and had been put together by a collection of
larger, powerful banks, including SBS Agro, a bank headed by
Alexander Smolensky, who had ties to Boris Berezovksy, Russia's
master political intriguer, financier and media mogul.
</P>
<P>
   Whether those powerful patrons invented, used, or even knew of
the elaborate money transfer schemes through front companies
controlled by Berlin is not known.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the $7 billion that moved through the front companies,
Benex, BECA and Lowland, belonged to Russian importers looking for
ways to pay foreign suppliers without alerting Russian authorities
to the real value of their contracts. But there is evidence that
the schemes were also used by criminals to launder money, and by
rich Russians to park profits overseas, in offshore havens.
</P>
<P>
   The more fully Edwards, the former Bank of New York vice
president, and her husband, Berlin, cooperate with federal
authorities, the more nervous many of Russia's top bankers are
likely to become.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am certain that if these two continue to talk, they will be
able to say a lot about illegal activities, the participants in
which would include well known financiers and public figures,''
said Yuri Skuratov, Russia's former prosecutor general. The Kremlin
ousted him from his job last winter, setting off successive waves
of financial scandal.
</P>
<P>
   But sorting out the facts is a formidable task. With lax
reporting standards, weak laws and a high mortality rate among
banks, paper trails meander through tangles of shifting owners and
sometimes disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this thicket: in the documents filed in federal court
on Wednesday in Manhattan, both MDM and Sobinbank were mentioned as
participants in wire transfers to the Benex and BECS accounts. And
money transferred to Benex and BECS between February 1996 and the
fall of that year went through an account at the Bank of New York
held by MDM, the documents show.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1996, Edwards allegedly opened an account for
Sobinbank that was later substituted by an account for DKB.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, money from Flamingo went to yet another account
at the bank set up by Edwards and her husband, in the name of
Lowland, via Sobinbank of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, acting on a tip from federal investigators in the
Bank of New York scandal, Russian agents swooped down on Flamingo,
and scooped up $430,000 and 3.3 million rubles in loose cash lying
around its offices, unaccounted for and otherwise undocumented.
Russia's prosecutors have since brought criminal charges against
Flamingo for ``illegal banking activity.''
</P>
<P>
   In October, after the raid, Moscow police officials began an
investigation at Sobinbank's headquarters, opening up safety
deposit boxes. In one, held by a deputy director of an institute
connected to the Russian space program, they found $1.6 million in
cash and six kilograms of gold ingots. No charges have been brought
against Sobinbank.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Andersen audits of SBS-Agro, which is now virtually
bankrupt, described Sobinbank in the late 1990s as a subsidiary of
SBS-Agro, which the auditors found also owned 20 percent of the
shares in Flamingo.
</P>
<P>
   In time, Sobinbank was also owned in part by Manezh, developers
of a vast underground shopping mall at the foot of the Kremlin that
was a pet project of Yuri Luzhkov, the Moscow mayor, and one of his
favorite businessmen, Umar Dzhabrailov. Other owners include
Lukoil, an oil company; Energia, which builds spacecraft, and two
smaller banks.
</P>
<P>
   Later, both MDM and Sobinbank shared a patron: Alexander Mamut,
a soft-spoken young lawyer and banker who is closely tied to an
inner circle of advisers to President Boris Yeltsin and his
daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Mamut, who had his own bank, KOPF, joined the Sobinbank
board, where he remained until taking the chairmanship of MDM last
year. In each case he appears to have helped draw significant
clients, including Sibneft, an oil conglomerate; Almazy
Rossii-Sakha, Russia's largest diamond company; and Energia, the
space program company.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that the scheme survived because it had the benefit
of political patrons in Moscow. But a Russian banker familiar with
the scheme said the Benex accounts' good reputation also came from
the protection that Benex seemed to enjoy at the Bank of New York,
which had significant business in Moscow. ``They established a
niche,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed last fall, the Sobinbank president, Alexander
Zanadvorov, insisted that he had never met Edwards or Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I understand it,'' he said, ``Benex and BECS worked
actively with Russian banks and Russian companies. If anyone wanted
to, they could drag a lot of banks and companies into this.''

BFA MAY JOIN PLAINTIFFS IN CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY MAX JARMAN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baptist Foundation of Arizona investors seeking to recover $400
million in losses are expected to file a lawsuit Friday against the
worldwide accounting firm Arthur Andersen &AMP; Co., which audited the
foundation's books for at least 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the investors said a similar action is being
prepared against Jennings, Strouss &AMP; Salmon, the prominent Phoenix
law firm that approved BFA's solicitations for investors.
</P>
<P>
   The new legal offensive is part of a larger move that would add
BFA itself to the two existing investor lawsuits, creating a united
front to pursue those thought to be responsible for the fund's
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``By combining with the class action, we'll have one big piece
of artillery, instead of a dozen rifles,'' said Jock Patton,
chairman of the BFA restructuring committee.
</P>
<P>
   But the move could be blocked by a committee of BFA's creditors,
which would prefer to file its own suit against the reported
culprits.
</P>
<P>
   The investors' lawyers are expected to file the amended lawsuit
against Arthur Andersen today in Superior Court in Phoenix. The
BFA's restructuring committee will seek Bankruptcy Court approval
to retain the investors' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Andersen, which repeatedly gave BFA a clean bill of
financial health, issued a statement Thursday saying it sympathizes
with the BFA investors but stands by the accuracy of its audits.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Lassen, Jennings, Strouss' managing attorney, said the firm
was very concerned about the situation but was comfortable with the
quality of its services for BFA.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Andersen, whose Chicago-based parent, Andersen Worldwide,
had revenue of $16.3 billion last year, has the deepest pockets of
any of the parties being pursued.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're certainly capable of responding to a substantial
judgment,'' said Andrew Friedman, an attorney with one of the five
law firms representing the 13,000 BFA investors.
</P>
<P>
   The investors' lawyers are confident they will soon have the
documentation they need to add Jennings, Strouss to the suit. The
law firm has claimed attorney-client privilege and is blocking
discovery efforts. The privilege prevents a law firm from
testifying about a client.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman is working on getting BFA to waive the privilege and
will challenge it on the grounds that former BFA executives used
the firm's advice to perpetrate fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the alleged fraud was the generation of bogus
profits by selling real estate to phony buyers at inflated prices.
The phony deals, which occurred from 1986 until last year, led to a
mismatch of assets where there wasn't enough money coming in to
cover obligations to investors. To bridge the gap, BFA resorted to
a classic Ponzi scheme where it was taking money from new investors
to pay off existing ones.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Corporation Commission, which oversees the
securities industry, has already launched a criminal investigation
into the BFA case.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Reese, a lawyer for the secured creditors' committee, said
the committee supports litigation by BFA but is concerned about a
conflict of interest if the same lawyers are used who are handling
the investor class-action suit.
</P>
<P>
   Reese said committee members are concerned about how any
settlement would be allocated, something that should be decided
upfront. She said there also is concern that the defendants could
file counterclaims against the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These types of conflicts have to be resolved first,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, BFA obtained a restraining order Thursday against
former director L. Dwaine Hoover, freezing a $15 million settlement
he was scheduled to receive from non-BFA sources. BFA said it
intends to file suit today against another former director, Harold
Friend, seeking an accounting of his numerous transactions with
BFA.
</P>
<P>
   Existing suits already target the following people:
</P>
<P>
   Bill Crotts, BFA's former executive director and the reported
mastermind of the fraudulent real estate transactions and Ponzi
schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Jalma Hunsinger, president of ALO and New Church Ventures, two
organizations that bought inflated real estate from BFA and is
thought to have benefited from insider deals.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Grabinski, BFA's former general counsel and vice

ISIDORE DOLLINGER, 96, PROSECUTOR AND CONGRESSMAN FROM THE BRONX 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Isidore Dollinger, a former congressman from the Bronx who was
also a state legislator, a district attorney and a judge, died Jan.
30 in a hospital in White Plains, N.Y., where he had lived for the
last several years. He was 96.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat, Dollinger was a member of the House of
Representatives from 1949 to 1959, representing the 23rd
Congressional District. The district takes in West Farms, Crotona,
Hunts Point and part of Morrisania, polyglot neighborhoods in the
Bronx that were then largely poor and Jewish, with a smattering of
Puerto Ricans, blacks and Italians.
</P>
<P>
   As a congressman, Dollinger was considered unswervingly liberal.
He was also known for his devotion to constituent service and his
ability to perform in what was then called melting-pot politics,
said his son, Edmund.
</P>
<P>
   He was also known for defeating Leo Isacson, a member of the
American Labor Party, who held the congressional seat for a few
months after a surprising victory in a special election in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Dollinger was born in Manhattan on Nov. 13, 1903, and graduated
from New York University and New York Law School. In the State
Legislature, he represented the Fourth Assembly District in the
Bronx from 1937 to 1944 and the 26th District in the Bronx in the
State Senate from 1945 to 1948. He lived most of his life in
Manhattan, where he had a law office, and in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, Dollinger was elected district attorney in the Bronx.
In 1968, he was elected to the State Supreme Court for the First
Judicial District in the Bronx and Manhattan, where served until
1975, when he retired.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Rose, died in 1994. Besides his son, who lives in
Cliffside Park, N.J., Dollinger is survived by two grandchildren
and two great-grandchildren.

GIULIANI SAYS HE'D WELCOME RIVAL IN PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In comments that appeared to call the bluff of Rep.
Rick Lazio of Long Island, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Thursday
that he would welcome Lazio as a competitor in a Republican primary
for U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be great,'' Giuliani said, however
disingenuously, during a news briefing at the city's emergency
command center. ``It would show that the Republican Party is open,
that there's more than a few Republicans who come from New York who
would like to serve in the Senate. What the heck, you can't stop
somebody from running in a primary, so if they want to run in a
primary, run.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he himself would then not run at all against Hillary
Rodham Clinton _ as the mayor's advisers indicated last year might
happen if Lazio entered the race _ Giuliani replied sarcastically,
``Oh, no, I'd back out immediately. You guys have covered me for
how long? Even if I wasn't going to run, I would then run.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days Lazio has dumbfounded New York's political
establishment by saying that he is still thinking of running
against Giuliani, the state party's anointed nominee. Reached
Thursday night at a congressional campaign meeting in Southern
California, Lazio repeated those remarks, said that he would make a
decision ``fairly soon'' about his candidacy, and added that he
believed Giuliani was running a dispirited race against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there has been no commitment to this race, no official
announcement, it is entirely possible that the mayor decides he
doesn't want to play in this race,'' Lazio said. He added that the
mayor's welcoming comment about him was ``a politically correct
statement to make under the circumstances after what we've been
through in terms of ballot access in New York.'' Last month,
Giuliani rebuked the state party for trying, unsuccessfully, to
knock Sen. John McCain off the ballot in New York's March 7
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's remarks were certain to further aggravate the state
party, which has been careening in an undisciplined state in recent
weeks. Gov. George Pataki, who some say was quietly encouraging
Lazio to run until national Republicans pressured him to back off
last summer, has long been suspected by Giuliani's advisers of
undermining the mayor's candidacy. Pataki's advisers say this is
not true. In either case, Pataki has a contentious relationship
with Giuliani, who is under pressure from Republican leaders to
campaign more aggressively upstate.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani made his remarks about Lazio alongside Ehud Olmert, the
mayor of Jerusalem and a friend, after the two had toured the
city's emergency command center in Lower Manhattan. Olmert, a
member of the conservative Likud party who is distrustful of
Clinton because of her statement of support for an eventual
Palestinian state, said he was not in town to make a political
endorsement. But then he appeared to do precisely that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that I can say, in complete confidence and good
conscience, is that Mayor Giuliani has been the greatest friend of
the city of Jerusalem for many, many years,'' Olmert said. He then
criticized Clinton for one of the low moments of her campaign, last
November on the West Bank, when Clinton sat quietly and listened to
Suha Arafat excoriate Israel for using what Arafat said were
carcinogenic crowd-control gases in Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Giuliani's news briefing Thursday was devoted to
criticism of either Clinton or her husband, or to responding to
criticism by Clinton of him. Thursday, for example, Clinton
criticized the mayor for ordering the bulldozing of Esperanza
Garden, a community garden on East Seventh Street in Manhattan. The
garden is to be sold to a developer to build low- and middle-income
housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor thinks you can bulldoze first and ask questions
later,'' Clinton said, first in a statement issued by her office
and then at a meeting Thursday night where she was endorsed by the
Working Families Party, a new political party created by labor
unions and other community groups. ``I don't think you can bulldoze
your way to the United States Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Clinton's comments, Giuliani responded, ``Oh, come
on. You can't see through that one? I can. Move on to a serious
subject, rather than a political game.''

GAMBLING INDUSTRY PLACES BETS ON BUSH, MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY KRIS MAYES AND BILL MULLER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Recent statements by John McCain in South Carolina opposing
legalized gambling were made in the face of strong financial
support for him from the gambling industry.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has been more ambiguous in his public statements
on gambling and has received more money from gaming interests,
according to data released Thursday by the Center for Responsive
Politics, a non-profit research group in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has expressed a personal affinity for playing the
tables, has received $69,312 in campaign contributions from the
gaming industry.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who says he engages only in an occasional friendly wager
on sports, received $95,450 from the same interests, more than any
other candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Democrats, Vice President Al Gore received $25,250, and
former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley got $8,500.
</P>
<P>
   Scott McClellan, a spokesman for Bush, said the Texas governor
has consistently opposed efforts to institute casino gambling in
Texas and does not personally engage in gambling.
</P>
<P>
   In public statements while campaigning in the Palmetto State,
where voters generally take a dim view of gambling, McCain has been
critical of the practice.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent presidential debate there, McCain said he supported
voters' decision to reject video poker games. And McCain voiced his
disapproval of lotteries, saying they are ``very harmful and
addictive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with these lotteries is that the poor people are
the ones who buy the lottery tickets, and it is a very regressive
tax,'' he said, adding that he would nevertheless ``leave it up to
the people of South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush presides over a state lottery approved by Texas voters
three years before he became governor. Bush, as a private citizen,
voted in favor of creating the lottery, his office told the
Associated Press last year.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's own gambling habits have become well-known among his
friends. The candidate makes trips to Las Vegas where, often in the
company with longtime friend and campaign aide Wes Gullett, the two
spend time playing craps.
</P>
<P>
   Gullett did not return phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has McCain made a secret of his love of other games of
chance, like slot machines and blackjack.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am not qualified to be president because I played craps
in Las Vegas, then fine, judge me for that,'' McCain recently told
``U.S. News &AMP; World Report.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's donor list includes well-known casino figures such as
Jack Binion (Horseshoe Gaming) and Steve Wynn (The Mirage, Treasure
Island, Bellagio and the Golden Nugget), among others.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn and Binion each gave the maximum $1,000 contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, 12 MGM Grand officials gave McCain a total of
$9,000 in contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Lanni, chairman of MGM Grand Inc., which owns or operates
10 casinos around the world, said most of the MGM contributions
were related to a McCain fund-raiser hosted by the hotel
corporation's PAC. The event, which McCain attended, was held at
the MGM Grand hotel in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Lanni said he doesn't press McCain on gambling issues, but he
organized the fund-raiser because he likes McCain's politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a great fan of John McCain,'' Lanni said. ``I've
never asked for him anything. I support him because I think he
would be very good for the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanni said he likes McCain's independence and integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's time we have an individual who has a high level of
integrity serving in the most important office in this country, if
not the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also received $13,550 in contributions from the
Mashantucket Pequot Indian tribe, which runs the Foxwoods casino in
Connecticut and is a large contributor to Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   During his senatorial career, McCain has been a staunch
proponent of Native American gaming rights. In 1988, the Arizona
senator was instrumental in the passage of the Indian Gaming
Regulatory Act, opening the door to the proliferation of Indian
gaming in Arizona and other states.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence of a direct correlation between the
financial contributions from Las Vegas interests and McCain's
legislative record. Nevada interests, for example, generally are
opposed to the legalization of Indian gaming.
</P>
<P>
   In other legislation unfavorable to Las Vegas, in December 1999,
McCain vowed to hold hearings into the use of slot machines that
use child-luring themes such as Spider-Man or Candy Land.
</P>
<P>
   And more recently, the Senator signed onto a bill that would ban
betting on college sports, a practice that is currently legal only
in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   John Smith, a columnist for the ``Las'' ``Vegas
Review-Journal,'' has been critical of McCain's leadership on the
measure, suggesting that it presents a ``hypocrisy test'' for
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   He said that, on one hand, McCain aids gaming efforts in his
home state and indulges in the practice in his spare time, while at
the same time managing to make political hay of it in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain is riding this issue like Secretariat in South
Carolina, and he may end up winning there,'' Smith said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's reading of the political winds in South Carolina is
accurate, according to one political observer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the right position in this state,'' said Henry
McMaster, chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party, who
noted that the state party's political platform expressly condemns
any form of gambling. ``With gambling comes corruption.'' &QL;

BALTIMORE NICKEL CORNERBACK JENKINS TO VISIT COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys' top-priority search for cornerback
help in the free-agent market begins today when Baltimore nickel
corner DeRon Jenkins pays a visit to Valley Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan McNeil, a former NFL interception leader (nine with the
1997 St. Louis Rams) who played last season for the Cleveland
Browns, is expected to follow in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, with two career interceptions in four NFL seasons, was
used by the Ravens mostly in nickel packages. At 5-foot-11, 190
pounds, the former second-round pick from Tennessee is considered a
good cover corner and an above-average tackler.
</P>
<P>
   A lean year for quality free-agent cornerbacks was made leaner
after the first week of signings. That's when New Orleans' Ashley
Ambrose and Buffalo's Thomas Smith, considered to be the top two
unrestricted free agents at their position, signed similar
five-year, $22.5 million deals with Atlanta and Chicago,
respectively. Their signing bonuses were in the $6.5 million-7.5
million range.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins won't command that kind of money, although he's
apparently good enough to be on Cowboys' short list of ``four or
five names'' worthy of bringing in, said Stephen Jones, Cowboys'
vice president/director of player personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are thought to be interested in bringing back two
unsigned cornerbacks of their own: Charlie Williams, an
unrestricted free agent who made nine of his NFL career 14 starts
last season because of injuries, and Kevin Mathis, a starter at the
end of the 1998 season who has received a qualifying offer as a
restricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins becomes the first free-agent visitor from another team
at Valley Ranch since the signing period began last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Joey Galloway, a Seattle free agent who had been
``franchised'' by the Seahawks, was acquired by the Cowboys in a
trade for 2000 and 2001 first-round draft picks. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   -- Defensive end Kavika Pittman, an unrestricted free agent and
a Cowboys starter the past two season, has visits scheduled with
Denver and Atlanta. But the big money at that position is going
fast. Atlanta's Chuck Smith (five-year, $20 million deal from
Carolina), Seattle's Phillip Daniels (five-year, $25 million deal
from Chicago) and Pittsburgh's Orpheus Roye (six-year, $30 million
deal from Cleveland) have already cashed in as unrestricted
free-agent defensive ends. Pittman's agent might want to use Roye's
deal as a negotiating guideline for his client because both players
are four-year veterans, and Pittman has both more career starts (31
to 20) and more career sacks (10 to 9) than Roye.
</P>
<P>
   -- Wide receiver Jason Tucker recently underwent ``clean up''
surgery for bone spurs in both big toes, while wide receiver Wane
McGarity had reconstructive shoulder surgery this week. Both
players face an estimated two to three months of rehabilitation. nn

HATCHER RETURNS TO A REJUVENATED STARS TEAM AFTER A NINE-WEEK
INJURY LAYOFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Stars captain Derian Hatcher's son asked him
yesterday what they were going to do this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I was going to have to leave this weekend to go on
a road trip,'' Hatcher said. ``He doesn't want me to go. They got
used to me being around.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher's Mr. Mom-like existence ends tonight when, after being
sidelined for nine weeks with a lacerated calf muscle, he returns
to the Stars' lineup for a key Pacific Division matchup against
Phoenix. This is what they call a four-point game in the NHL. If
the Stars win, they take a six-point lead over the Coyotes in the
division. If they lose, the Coyotes get as close as two points.
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't the Stars have picked an easier game for Hatcher to
return? The Coyotes do, after all, still hate him for the whole
jaw-breaking incident with center Jeremy Roenick last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's going to be revved up, and I know I'm probably
going to have to keep my head up,'' Hatcher said. ``That's the
thing, though, who do I jump in against? You look at our schedule
coming up and it's a lot of good teams.''
</P>
<P>
   In their next 12 games over 17 days, the Stars play Phoenix
twice, Detroit twice and Colorado twice. With the exception of St.
Louis, they're facing the best in the Western Conference and as an
added bonus have Philadelphia, one of the best teams in the Eastern
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's huge,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said of the stretch of
games. ``Hard games, boy? Nothing easy. We'd like to have more
hands on deck for it but that's the cards we're dealt right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are still missing last season's Conn Smythe winner,
Joe Nieuwendyk, last season's Selke Trophy winner, Jere Lehtinen,
along with Brian Skrudland and Shawn Chambers.
</P>
<P>
   So getting Hatcher back doesn't mark the end of the injuries,
but it's a step.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have come out of what could have been a disastrous
nine-week stretch not only unscathed but smelling like roses. When
Hatcher went down Dec. 17, the Stars were in fourth place in the
Pacific Division, trailing San Jose, Phoenix and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of getting left by San Jose, Los Angeles and Phoenix,
they've blown past them. They're in first in the Pacific, 16-7-1
since Hatcher went down. That fact hasn't gone unnoticed by
Phoenix, which hasn't had nearly the injuries nor the success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what we are waiting for. We have to get going,''
Phoenix's Dallas Drake said. ``We keep taking two steps forward and
then two steps back. Before you know it, we'll be 10 points behind
Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the players wonder what effect injuries have on the
conference race: Would they already have that much distance between
themselves and the Coyotes? And how much closer the Stars might
have been to St. Louis, which was seven points ahead of them in the
Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The land of what-ifs isn't a place where Hatcher allows himself
to venture. It isn't fun.
</P>
<P>
   What if he hadn't been hurt? Could he have won the Norris
Trophy?
</P>
<P>
   He had been mounting what arguably was a Norris-like season. He
was averaging 30-plus minutes a game and had solidified his
reputation as the best defensive defenseman in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I was having probably my best season,'' Hatcher said.
``I think that was the most frustrating thing.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other what-ifs, too.
</P>
<P>
   What if Edmonton winger Todd Marchant's skate had caught Hatcher
an inch lower on Dec. 17? Could he have had his Achilles' tendon
severed?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was my Achilles','' Hatcher said. ``I think
that's where some of the fear set in. ... So in a way, I'm lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   So Hatcher doesn't bother with what-ifs, although, he's still
facing questions of another variety.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't know when his calf will let him play like he was
before the injury. The guy who left averaging 30-plus minutes a
game will start out playing between 15 and 20 minutes. The guy who
always has been part of the shutdown pair with Richard Matvichuk
won't be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we put him with Matty only, I think that's unfair for
Derian because that's a big role,'' Hitchcock said. ``We'll
probably use three groups of two, not two groups of three. I don't
think we can afford to play a pair right now because that pair
would have to play a lot of minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hatcher got injured, the Stars weren't sure if they could
afford to be without him. He, along with goalie Ed Belfour, had
been the Stars best player. As Stars general manager Bob Gainey
said at the time: ``It's one thing to lose a player, a good player,
when everything was functioning well. You could sort of plaster
over that crack more easily. But when it's not ...''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher had been the plaster covering a plethora of cracks _
lack of scoring and defensive lapses to name a few. The way
Hitchcock sees it, the Stars have used Hatcher's injury to become a
better team because it forced them to fix the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   So could Hatcher's injury have a silver lining?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it could,'' Hatcher said. ``But only time will tell.''

LANDRY FAREWELL FINAL HUDDLE OF COWBOYS' PAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ In words and song, they bid farewell to coach Tom
Landry on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   For most of them, he was the only Cowboys coach they ever had.
He was, to use Roger Staubach's profound words, ``our rock, our
hope, our inspiration. He was our coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the pipe organ and the towering stained glass of
Highland Park United Methodist Church, they gathered in the front
pews _ a symbolic final huddle, of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   There was Tex Schramm, the man who helped hire the only coach
that the Cowboys would need for 29 years. There was Gil Brandt,
whose eye for talent helped seed rosters that produced 20
consecutive winning seasons.
</P>
<P>
   There was Staubach. There were Craig Morton, Danny White, Glenn
Carano _ Landry's quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   There were the rocks of his defense _ Bob Lilly, Randy White,
Charlie Waters, Mel Renfro, Cliff Harris.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the best of Landry's offense _ Tony Dorsett, Don
Perkins, Bob Hayes, Drew Pearson.
</P>
<P>
   There was Gene Stallings, one of Landry's most able coaching
disciples. There was linebackers coach Jerry Tubbs and conditioning
coach Bob Ward and Barbara Goodman, the coach's longtime secretary.
</P>
<P>
   And there were dozens and dozens more, names from the Cowboys'
glorious past.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Landry's past.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could such a shy man grow to be so loved and respected by
so many?'' Staubach asked at the private service.
</P>
<P>
   Faith and deeds, Staubach answered. Tom Landry walked his talk.
He was a rock. And upon this rock, the Cowboys grew to be the most
famous pro football team in the land.
</P>
<P>
   The service was held in the same sanctuary where Landry and his
wife Alicia worshipped for 43 years. The gathering numbered an
estimated 1,200.
</P>
<P>
   Led by the church's Chancel Choir, they sang ``How Great Thou
Art'' and ``Amazing Grace''. Ministers the Rev. Mark Craig and the
Rev. Kenneth Dickson offered prayers, scripture readings and their
own personal remembrances of the coach.
</P>
<P>
   Craig spoke of the respect, mixed with awe, that he held for
Landry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only two men in the world that I couldn't find the
courage to call by their first names,'' Craig said. ``My father and
Tom Landry.''
</P>
<P>
   On an altar in front of the sanctuary sat one of Landry's
trademark hats. There were two bouquets, each with about 100 red
roses, flanking the pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   Staubach was the first to share his personal memories of the
coach. He ended his brief talk by reading a poem that he knew had
been Landry's favorite. When he had finished reading, Staubach
revealed that the poem had been written by Lisa Landry Childress,
Landry's daughter who died of cancer in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Landry Jr., the coach's son, also spoke, telling the
gathering, ``My father was everything that you imagined him to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the luckiest person in the world,'' Landry Jr. said,
``and that is because the finest man I've ever known was my
father.''
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony was both dignified and brief. There were no TV
cameras, in keeping with the family's earnest request for privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful, understandably, that a conventional funeral and burial
might turn into a hearse-shadowing circus, the Landry family had
quietly lain the coach to rest late Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Held at Sparkman Hillcrest Funeral Home, it was a gathering
strictly of family _ his Cowboys ``family,'' in large part.
According to players who were there, team chaplain Howard Hendricks
delivered a heart-rending eulogy. Around the room, tears flowed,
even among Cowboy giants such as Lilly, Walt Garrison and Randy
White.
</P>
<P>
   It was sad, but it was more than that. Unlike teams such as the
49ers, Raiders and Chiefs, the Cowboys mostly have been spared the
loss of their heroes. Even two of the franchise's founding fathers,
Schramm and Brandt, remain alive and active.
</P>
<P>
   As the players carried their coach _ their rock _ to his grave
Wednesday, they were taking part of themselves. It was a mournful
signal that the Cowboys' era of greatness, the Landry years, truly
are done.
</P>
<P>
   How sadly ironic that Landry, their leader, would be the first
to go.
</P>
<P>
   In a heart-tugging way, the great Cowboys reunion has begun. Our
eyes can't help but feel the tears. nn

WHEN SAYING GOODBYE TO LANDRY, IT'S ALL ABOUT HONOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ As they tipped their helmets and shed their tears one
last time for Tom Landry on Thursday, a matured America's Team came
to a soothing realization:
</P>
<P>
   God's Coach was larger than life, and he'll be even larger in
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real testament about Tom is that _ you watch _ he'll teach
us more now that he's gone than when he was here,'' said Dallas
Cowboys Hall-of-Famer Mel Renfro. ``We were learning from him and
we didn't even know it at the time. Now we know.''
</P>
<P>
   During one last roundup to eulogize their longtime trail boss at
the Meyerson Symphony Center, the best-known Cowboys led a tearful,
joyous public meof Landry that hailed his lasting legacy by
focusing more on his steadfast personal character than his
star-studded professional career.
</P>
<P>
   ``His physical body is gone, but his examples will last
forever,'' Hall-of-Famer Bob Lilly said. ``I know my kids have
heard the lessons he taught me, and hopefully their kids will hear
them too. He would like nothing more than for us to spread a little
of him to our kids and to the nation. After all, we are his
legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The late, great Landry, who died of leukemia at age 75 Saturday,
won football games and Super Bowls with his innovative mind,
granite game face and meticulous preparation. But, more
importantly, he touched hearts and changed lives with his humble
moral fiber, flawless integrity and transcendent character.
</P>
<P>
   In his trademark fedora and with all the consistency and pizzazz
of a metronome, Landry was the shepherd on the Cowboys' sideline
for an unprecedented 29 seasons, setting a standard sure to outlast
even the Energizer Bunny.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the NFL had a Mount Rushmore, the profile would be of Tom
Landry,'' NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said. ``He's one of
greatest gifts ever to the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry's passing moved Ben Teague to drive from Maryland in
order to be first in line Thursday at 7 a.m. so not to miss one of
the center's 1,600 seats available to the public. It also prompted
former Cowboys star receiver Bob Hayes to fly in from Florida,
where he had been bedside with his cancer-stricken father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was also a father to me,'' said Hayes, whom Landry
testified for during a drug-trafficking trial. ``I wouldn't miss it
for the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in attendance was former linebacker Thomas ``Hollywood''
Henderson, whom Landry cut because of drug problems only later to
write several letters, asking for his early parole from prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like an estranged stepchild that misses his dad,''
Henderson said between tears. ``No one knows exactly how much he
meant to me. For a long time, one of those people was me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkled in the building were the Cowboys' five Hall-of-Fame
players: Tony Dorsett, Randy White, Roger Staubach, Lilly and
Renfro; several Rows of Honor filled with former president and
general manager Tex Schramm, former assistants Mike Ditka and Dan
Reeves; former player personnel director Gil Brandt; former players
Lee Roy Jordan, Don Perkins; and, fittingly sitting side-by-side,
co-safeties Cliff Harris and Charlie Waters, and even current
Cowboys representatives Jerry Jones, Dave Campo and Troy Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest disappointments in my career will be not
getting to play for coach Landry,'' Aikman said. ``He was one of
the greatest coaches of all-time and by all accounts an even better
person. When my kids and grandkids ask me what it was like to play
for coach Landry, I wish I could tell them.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry won 270 games, third-most in NFL history, directed 20
consecutive winning seasons, coached in five Super Bowls (winning
two) and introduced the NFL to innovations like the 4-3 defense and
the multiple-formation offense. But Thursday there was no talk
about that Hall-of-Fame resume or the impending public movement to
somehow work Landry's name into Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   With their admiration of Landry having grown as much as their
waistlines and bald spots, the former Cowboys fondly recalled his
comical mangling of names, obsession with timeliness, frightening
cold stares and unwavering Christian faith.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than being computer literate long before the Internet,
Landry was remembered more having the ability to lose a grinning
contest to Mona Lisa.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he looked at you with that stone face,'' said former
defensive end Harvey Martin, ``it was the worst feeling in the
world. He wasn't mad, but he was disappointed. And as we learned
more about him we all strived to keep him from being
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Perkins, ``If the meeting was at 9, he showed up at five
till, you showed up at 3 till, you were late. That's what we called
Tom-time.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry, the most identifiable Cowboy ever, always dressed his
Sunday best and was as comfortable in the pew as on the bench.
Former associates were constantly amazed by his perfect role model
_ a faith-based life without wearing his Christianity on his
sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   ``With him it was God, family and then football,'' White said.
``But he wasn't overzealous about it. He made you want to follow
him by his example. I didn't understand what he was talking about
back then. But while he was teaching us X's and O's, he was
teaching us about life. We all understand that now.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Tagliabue, ``His legacy is immaculate. It has nothing to
do with taunting, end-zone dancing or off-field shenanigans.''
</P>
<P>
   After almost a week on bended knees during Landry's battle with
illness and eventual death, players urged fans to rise up and make
their former coach proud by living by his example.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was our rock, our hope, our inspiration, our coach,''
Staubach said. ``The world was a better place with him in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Added former quarterback Danny White, ``We're all better people
for having known him. You can see a little of him in a lot of us.''

KARSTEN SOLHEIM, 88, IS DEAD; CREATOR OF THE PING GOLF CLUBS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Calif.)  (rk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Karsten Solheim, one of the world's leading innovators in golf
club design, died on Wednesday at his home in Phoenix. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from Parkinson's disease, his family
said.
</P>
<P>
   Solheim was the founder of Karsten Manufacturing and the creator
of Ping golf clubs. He was the first to develop perimeter-weight
irons, a design that distributes the weight of the irons to the
outer edges, increasing the sweet spot and allowing more room for
error. He was the first to use investment casting, aimed at
improving the consistency of irons. And he was also the first to
put the letter ``L'' on a high-lofted club that has become part of
golf vernacular _ the lob wedge.
</P>
<P>
   A great supporter of women's golf, Solheim sponsored the Solheim
Cup, a biennial competition between golfers from the United States
and Europe that is the women's version of the Ryder Cup. He stepped
down as president and chief executive of Karsten Manufacturing in
1995; Ping golf clubs remain among the most popular in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Described as a gentle genius by many in the golf industry,
Solheim could be tough when necessary. In 1989, he sued the U.S.
Golf Association and the PGA Tour over his use of square grooves in
irons. The case was eventually settled out of court, and the tour
backed off its threat to ban his clubs in competition.
</P>
<P>
   Solheim was a self-made millionaire who started his business in
his garage. Born on Sept. 15, 1911 in Bergen, Norway, he moved to
the United States at age 2 with his family. He grew up in Seattle
where his father was a shoemaker, but Solheim eventually decided to
become an engineer. In 1953, he joined General Electric as a
mechanical engineer and helped design the rabbit ears antenna that
clamped onto General Electric's first portable television.
</P>
<P>
   At 42, he started to play golf and immediately became enamored
of the sport. Frustrated that he could never improve his 5
handicap, he consistently looked for ways to enhance the game, and
began to use his engineering skills to design clubs. The model for
his first putter was two Popsicle sticks glued to two sugar cubes
with a shaft in the middle. That putter, designed in his garage in
Redwood City, Calif., made a distinctive ``ping'' sound when it
made contact with the ball, therefore, Ping became the name for his
putters and clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after leaving General Electric in 1959, Solheim founded
his company and began to concentrate full time on golf club
manufacturing and design. One of his first goals was to alter the
blade putter that Arnold Palmer made so popular during the 1960s.
Solheim eventually found the answer to improving the putter, a
cavity-back, offset design that created heel-toe balance.
</P>
<P>
   Solheim wrote the answer for his new putter design on the sleeve
of a 78 revolutions-per-minute record jacket. Looking for a name to
call his new putter, Solheim's wife, Louise, suggested dropping the
letter ``W'' from the word answer so it would fit onto the club.
The ``Anser'' putter is still one of the most popular in the game.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Solheim moved his growing business to Phoenix where it
continued to flourish. His Ping Eye2 irons were the dominant irons
on tour during the 1980s. Karsten Manufacturing celebrated its 40th
anniversary last year, and the company is run by Solheim's son,
John, who took over in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Solheim had been confined to a wheelchair in recent years, but
he often sat in his backyard in Phoenix and looked out over Moon
Valley Country Club, which his family has owned since 1984. Twice a
guest at the White House, Solheim received numerous awards and
honors. In 1991, he received the Patty Berg Award for contributions
to women's golf. In 1996, he received the Ernie Sabayrac Award from
the PGA of America for lifetime contributions to the golf industry.
And in 1999, he received the Ford Achievement Award.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, whom he married in 1936, he is survived by
three sons, John, Allan and Karsten Louis, who all work for
Solheim's company, and a daughter, Sandra, who is a Ping sales
representative in South Dakota.

JI PENGFEI, 91, HELPED CHINA OPEN LINKS TO WEST 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ji Pengfei, who took part as China's foreign minister in the
Chinese-U.S. summitry during President Nixon's visit to Beijing in
1972, died on Feb. 10 in Beijing. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Ji was born into a peasant family in Shanxi province, and at
first joined Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist forces. But in 1931,
after Chiang turned against the Communists, Ji joined them and
later became a member of the party. In 1934 and 1935, Ji went on
the Red Army's Long March.
</P>
<P>
   In his long political career, he was deputy prime minister,
ambassador to East Germany and vice chairman of the Standing
Committee of China's Fifth National People's Congress, and held
senior posts in the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Ji, deputy foreign minister from 1955 to 1972, was foreign
minister from 1972 to 1974. This gave him a prominent, although
secondary, role during Nixon's visit to Beijing, which brought a
breakthrough in the hostile relations between China and the United
States. The visit led to a joint agreement to forge closer
relations in diplomacy, culture and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   During the visit, Ji took part in detailed discussions _ with
Secretary of State William P. Rogers and others _ on future
contacts between Washington and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Ji became China's director of Hong Kong and Macau
affairs and figured prominently in talks with Britain in the 1980s
concerning the return of Hong Kong to China, which took place in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   He was chairman of the committee that drafted the Basic Law, the
document that has been called Hong Kong's miniconstitution for the
post-handover era.
</P>
<P>
   He was married to Xu Hanbing. Information about survivors was
not immediately available.

BAPTIST FOUNDATION LIQUIDATION PLAN READY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY HAL MATTERN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Investors in the Baptist Foundation of Arizona could
expect to receive about 40 cents on the dollar under a liquidation
plan filed Friday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
</P>
<P>
   That amount could increase considerably, possibly by enough to
repay the entire $590 million owed to investors, if a lawsuit
against former BFA officials and their lawyers and accountants is
successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, our hope is that everybody will get everything
back, but I can't speculate on how the lawsuit will turn out,''
said Jock Patton, chairman of foundation's restructuring committee,
which developed the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation froze investors' accounts in August and filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November. The filing listed
total liabilities of $640 million, of which $590 million is owed to
about 13,000 investors. The rest is owed to banks and other
third-party secured creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Under the liquidation plan, the foundation would sell off its
assets over the next few years, returning the proceeds to investors
through quarterly payments. The assets, which include real estate
projects, land, golf courses and businesses, are worth about $240
million, Patton said.
</P>
<P>
   Foundation officials also are filing a $300 million to $400
million lawsuit today against their former executives and such
third parties as lawyers and the foundation's longtime accounting
firm, Arthur Andersen.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Reese, lawyer for the committee representing investors in
the bankruptcy case, called the liquidation proposal ``a
significant accomplishment for investors.'' &QL;

BFA MAY JOIN PLAINTIFFS IN CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (LAWSUIT-BAPTIST has been reslugged as a sidebar to BAPTIST) 
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baptist Foundation of Arizona investors seeking torecover $400
million in losses are expected to file a lawsuit Friday against the
worldwide accounting firm Arthur Andersen &AMP; Co., which audited the
foundation's books for at least 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the investors said a similar action is being
prepared against Jennings, Strouss &AMP; Salmon, the prominent Phoenix
law firm that approved BFA's solicitations for investors.
</P>
<P>
   The new legal offensive is part of a larger move that would add
BFA itself to the two existing investor lawsuits, creating a united
front to pursue those thought to be responsible for the fund's
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``By combining with the class action, we'll have one big piece
of artillery, instead of a dozen rifles,'' said Jock Patton,
chairman of the BFA restructuring committee.
</P>
<P>
   But the move could be blocked by a committee of BFA's creditors,
which would prefer to file its own suit against the reported
culprits.
</P>
<P>
   The investors' lawyers are expected to file the amended lawsuit
against Arthur Andersen today in Superior Court in Phoenix. The
BFA's restructuring committee will seek Bankruptcy Court approval
to retain the investors' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Andersen, which repeatedly gave BFA a clean bill of
financial health, issued a statement Thursday saying it sympathizes
with the BFA investors but stands by the accuracy of its audits.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Lassen, Jennings, Strouss' managing attorney, said the firm
was very concerned about the situation but was comfortable with the
quality of its services for BFA.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Andersen, whose Chicago-based parent, Andersen Worldwide,
had revenue of $16.3 billion last year, has the deepest pockets of
any of the parties being pursued.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're certainly capable of responding to a substantial
judgment,'' said Andrew Friedman, an attorney with one of the five
law firms representing the 13,000 BFA investors.
</P>
<P>
   The investors' lawyers are confident they will soon have the
documentation they need to add Jennings, Strouss to the suit. The
law firm has claimed attorney-client privilege and is blocking
discovery efforts. The privilege prevents a law firm from
testifying about a client.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman is working on getting BFA to waive the privilege and
will challenge it on the grounds that former BFA executives used
the firm's advice to perpetrate fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the alleged fraud was the generation of bogus
profits by selling real estate to phony buyers at inflated prices.
The phony deals, which occurred from 1986 until last year, led to a
mismatch of assets where there wasn't enough money coming in to
cover obligations to investors. To bridge the gap, BFA resorted to
a classic Ponzi scheme where it was taking money from new investors
to pay off existing ones.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Corporation Commission, which oversees the
securities industry, has already launched a criminal investigation
into the BFA case.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Reese, a lawyer for the secured creditors' committee, said
the committee supports litigation by BFA but is concerned about a
conflict of interest if the same lawyers are used who are handling
the investor class-action suit.
</P>
<P>
   Reese said committee members are concerned about how any
settlement would be allocated, something that should be decided
upfront. She said there also is concern that the defendants could
file counterclaims against the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These types of conflicts have to be resolved first,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, BFA obtained a restraining order Thursday against
former director L. Dwaine Hoover, freezing a $15 million settlement
he was scheduled to receive from non-BFA sources. BFA said it
intends to file suit today against another former director, Harold
Friend, seeking an accounting of his numerous transactions with
BFA.
</P>
<P>
   Existing suits already target the following people:
</P>
<P>
   Bill Crotts, BFA's former executive director and the reported
mastermind of the fraudulent real estate transactions and Ponzi
schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Jalma Hunsinger, president of ALO and New Church Ventures, two
organizations that bought inflated real estate from BFA and is
thought to have benefited from insider deals.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Grabinski, BFA's former general counsel and vice
president, who with Crotts is alleged to have developed the
fraudulent schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Norwood, former chairman of BFA's board, who is thought to
have had knowledge of the fraudulent schemes. &QL;

DAFT BECOMES COKE CHAIRMAN AHEAD OF SCHEDULE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Douglas N. Daft became chairman and chief executive of Coca-Cola
Co. Thursday as M. Douglas Ivester moved up his retirement date.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester, 52, shocked the business world in December by saying he
would retire after a tumultuous two years in the company's top job,
but agreed at the time to stay on until April to smooth the
management transition. Daft was quickly named his successor and he
quickly took charge, reorganizing the company and eliminating the
need for Ivester to remain in office.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Stahl, 46, became president and chief operating officer
Thursday, replacing Daft, 56.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Doug Daft and Jack Stahl are already calling the
shots,'' said Bill Pecoriello, a beverage stocks analyst for
Sanford C. Bernstein, ``it doesn't make sense to keep him on until
April.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Ivester said, ``That transition is complete, and
I am very confident that the Coca-Cola Co. is in very good hands
under the leadership of Doug Daft and Jack Stahl.''
</P>

   Ivester is leaving Coca-Cola with a very generous retirement
package. It includes about $16 million in long-term restricted
stock. Ivester is also leaving with a chunk of Coke stock awarded
to him upon his retirement. When asked how many shares this
included, a company spokesman would only say it was ``lots.''
Ivester will keep an office at Coca-Cola and will be paid for
consulting work for a number of years. Complete details of the the
retirement package will be disclosed in the company proxy statement
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester took over in October 1997 after the death of Roberto C.
Goizueta, who in 16 years as chairman and chief executive built
Coke into a formidable global competitor with profit and sales
growth that made it a favorite on Wall Street. Ivester is credited
with designing much of the system that enabled that growth,
including the consolidation of bottlers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   By 1998, Coca-Cola began to sputter along with the economies of
Japan, Russia, parts of Latin America and other crucial markets.
With alarming regularity, Coke executives alerted investors that
the company would not meet its aggressive growth targets for
earnings and volume. A series of public relations disasters _
including the biggest product recall in company history last June,
some thwarted attempts to acquire additional brands, and a
racial-discrimination lawsuit filed by some of its black employees
_ also contributed to a widespread disillusionment with the
company's stock, and may have led board members to press Ivester to
make changes.
</P>
<P>
   Since Daft was named his successor, the extent of the damage at
the company has been laid bare. Last month, Daft announced that
Coke would lay off about 6,000 workers, or one-fifth of its
employees worldwide, and write down more than $800 million in
poorly performing investments. The company is also moving
responsibilities to local managers from Atlanta and pursuing brands
and flavors other than Coca-Cola in hopes of improving its
profitability.

MCCAIN REFUSES TO APOLOGIZE FOR USING ANTI-ASIAN SLUR TO
DESCRIBE  HIS CAPTORS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By C.W. NEVIUS, MARC SANDALOW and JOHN WILDERMUTH 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Greenville, S.C. _ Arizona Sen. John McCain refused to
apologize Thursday for his use of a racial slur to condemn the
North Vietnamese prison guards who tortured and held him captive
during the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate the gooks,'' McCain said Thursday in response to a
question from reporters aboard his campaign bus. ``I will hate them
as long as I live.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a former Navy pilot who spent five years in a Vietnamese
prisoner of war camp, was questioned about the language because of
a story last month in the Nation magazine reporting his continuing
use of the slur.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, reports of McCain's language have been circulating
on Internet chat sites and e-mails among Asian Americans, many of
whom find the the term offensive and inappropriate for an elected
official.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's appeal to voters has been as a wartime hero and a
feisty politician who speaks his mind and damn the consequences.
But his comments on the eve of the key South Carolina primary show
the candidate's vaunted `'straight talk'' in another light.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of a racist slur can't be acceptable for any national
leader, regardless of his background,'' said Diane Chin, executive
director of the San Francisco-based Chinese for Affirmative Action.
``For someone running for president not to recognize the power of
words is a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   While McCain's words may have little effect in conservative
South Carolina, where few Asian Americans live, they could come
back to haunt him in other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, straight talkers who say things off the top of
their heads eventually hang themselves with those sorts of
remarks,'' said Bruce Cain, a political scientist at the University
of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it might not hurt him now, Democrats are not going to
have any hesitation about using this stuff to string him up
later.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain made no apologies Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was referring to my prison guards,'' McCain said, ``and I
will continue to refer to them in language that might offend some
people because of the beating and torture of my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain made it clear that his anger extends only toward his
captors. As a senator, he was one of the leaders of the postwar
effort to normalize U.S. relations with Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials do not expect the controversy to hurt McCain,
either in tomorrow's South Carolina primary or later in the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people understood the context, they wouldn't be upset,''
Mike Murphy, a senior adviser to the campaign, said last night.
</P>
<P>
   But the racial slur used by the senator has a long, painful
history that is felt by many Asian Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``gook'' was first used in 1899 by American soldiers
fighting Filipino insurgents. During the Korean War, the term was
aimed at Koreans and Chinese. It was directed at the Vietnamese
when Americans were fighting there. It is now used as a slur toward
any Asian or Pacific Islander.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator prides himself on running an open campaign.
He is surrounded by reporters, television cameras and tape
recorders perhaps more than any presidential candidate in history.
Reporters are given full access to the candidate between each
campaign stop on a customized bus purposefully dubbed the
``Straight Talk Express.''
</P>
<P>
   The bus, which also carries his top staff and often his wife,
Cindy, is crammed with network anchors and local newspaper
reporters, who endlessly engage McCain in what amounts to a news
conference on wheels.
</P>
<P>
   The comments are usually recorded and always on the record.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the questions are pointed and serious. Sometimes they
are not.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has declared on his bus, ``I hate the French.'' He often
begins meetings with Californians joking, ``I hate Californians,''
noting that they steal Arizona's water and lure his constituents
away in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   But those comments are clearly in jest. Thursday's were not.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was captured after his A-4 Skyhawk was shot down over
Hanoi on Oct. 26, 1967. During the time he was held, he was
brutally tortured by his captors, finally reaching the point where
he was unable to resist signing a ``confession.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his fellow prisoners suffered terribly in the prison
camp. In the crowd at rally in Greenville Thursday was retired Adm.
Robert Fuller, who was in prison with McCain at the infamous
``Hanoi Hilton.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuller, who lives in Jacksonville Beach, Fla., spoke informally
of the despair of living in single cells, where the only form of
contact was by an ingenious code devised by the prisoners. Fuller
said prisoners were sometimes tortured for as many as six days.
When they returned, he said, the others would send messages of
support by tapping on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would be put in ropes for six days, and they would
confess,'' Fuller said. ``When they came back to their cell, guys
would tap on the wall, `We love you. I wish we could give you a
hug.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The horrors of the past cannot be an excuse for hurting people
in the present, said Guy Aoki, president of the Media Action
Network for Asian Americans, an anti-defamation group.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Sen. McCain had been captured by Nigerians, could he call
those people `niggers' and think he wasn't going to offend everyone
who is black?'' Akoi asked. ``We can all feel for what he went
through, but if that's his level of sensitivity, I'm very
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain usually treats his experience as a prisoner of war as a
terrible time in his life, but a period he has moved beyond. At
times, he even uses it as a punch line for jokes.
</P>
<P>
   At a pancake breakfast recently, he said he had gone with his
daughter to the MTV Music Awards, ``and that was the greatest
assault on my senses since I was in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's comments made it clear that McCain had neither
forgotten, nor forgiven, his captors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will call right now, my interrogator that tortured me, a
gook,'' McCain said. ``(I can't believe that) anybody doesn't
believe these interrogators and prison guards were cruel and
sadistic people who deserve the worst appellations possible.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he does not consider the comment an epithet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gook,'' he said, ``is the kindest appellation I can give.''
</P>

HOPES RUN HIGH AS LOTTO JACKPOT SOARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MICHAEL COIT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So you want to be a millionaire without being
embarrassed on a game show or marrying someone you've never met?
</P>
<P>
   In a nation suddenly obsessed with instant millionaires,
California offers its own chance to go from rags to filthy riches _
Saturday's estimated $55 million Super Lotto jackpot worth $27
million in hard cash right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``All it takes is some luck,'' Cathy Reece, a waitress who
contributed a few dollars to the ticket pool at Valley Ranch
Barbecue in Van Nuys, said Thursday. ``What keeps us playing is the
hope. Everyone wants to be a millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   She's not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Californians _ either on their own or through office
pools _ were buying tickets Thursday after the jackpot soared past
$30 million the night before. California Lottery officials said
that is the magic mark triggering the greatest sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're officially in lotto fever,'' said Norma Minas,
California Lottery spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   With nobody winning the $36 million jackpot in Wednesday's
drawing, ticket buying is expected to surge until the cutoff 15
minutes before the final drawing at 8 p.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The $55 million is currently the largest single-state lottery
jackpot in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bigger the jackpot, the more you will invest, the more
tickets you buy,'' said Alvaro Selga of Reseda, who bought five of
the $1 tickets Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The largest California Lottery jackpot was $118.8 million, won
by 54 people holding 10 winning tickets in April 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Salvador Gonzalez of Anaheim won the highest individual jackpot
of $87 million in June of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Given the growing jackpot, those buying tickets Thursday said
they had a better chance of winning a million dollars buying
lottery tickets than by going on any of the ``be-a-millionaire''
game shows popping up on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need all of (the $55 million). I just need a portion
of it,'' said Bonnie Bassin of Northridge. ``So I spend my three
bucks and take my chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be embarrassed to go on those shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Warner said winning even a share of $55 million is more
money than he could imagine having. He keeps trying to win ``a
little something'' and buys tickets on his own and through office
pools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not into the millionaire shows. The lotto is more fun,''
said Warner. ``Your odds are better with the dumb luck of the
lotto.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner spent more on tickets this week to keep up with the other
players. ``When the jackpot gets to $35 million, everyone shoves in
five dollars or more.''
</P>
<P>
   The taste of winning, even $175 split among co-workers in
December, keeps the office pool going at Studio City Dental Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very disappointing not to win Wednesday. Hopefully, our
chances will be good Saturday,'' said Anna Tovar, a receptionist
for the dental group.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we keep playing.''
</P>
<P>
   A single jackpot winner of $55 million would receive 26 annual
payments with the first totaling nearly $1.4 million and the last
totaling about $2.8 million before taxes, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated cash value would equal about half of the jackpot.
The $27 million is the amount the lottery would invest to pay the
jackpot prize over 26 years, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A $27 million payday might sound like a lot, but experienced
lotto players know it takes a lot of millions to make an office
pool happy. In fact, at the restaurant where Reece works, the
co-workers don't even bother with the lotto until it gets big.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be a big jackpot for us to play,'' Reece said.
``Anything under $25 million wouldn't be enough for us to quit our
jobs.''

LANDRY PASSED TESTS OF TIME, WILL, CHARACTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Since the fraternity of NFL head coaches is small, the
assumption is most know each other.
</P>
<P>
   But as a man who never assumes anything, Mike Holmgren took no
chances when he spotted Tom Landry in an airport lounge in Phoenix
a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren had been named NFL coach of the year, and was on his
way to receive the award. That didn't mean Landry, whom he had
never formally met, would know or care.
</P>
<P>
   Landry was, after all, the coach from Olympus, with little need
to mingle with mortals.
</P>
<P>
   After Holmgren sidled up, introduced himself and pumped the
great man's hand, Landry offered up, for him, an emotional outburst
_ a small smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' he said softly, ``who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren is used to the circle of celebrities, so finding
himself slightly awestruck was unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him how much I admired him,'' he said. ``He said some
nice things to me. It meant a lot. As I was growing up, I admired
him so much as a coach and as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL legend of Landry, who died of leukemia Saturday at 75,
was so immense, it is hard to believe he hasn't coached since 1989,
and that a generation separates him and Holmgren, 51.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Landry was the epitome of the NFL _ a bulwark of
excellence, consistency and stoicism while the American cultural
landscape heaved and twisted.
</P>
<P>
   He was coach of the Dallas Cowboys before John Kennedy assumed
the White House, and lasted until just before the rookie year of
Cortez Kennedy. In that span was an achievement that annually grows
more luminous, particularly in view of a salary cap system that
seems destined to throw good teams into roster chaos almost
annually.
</P>
<P>
   From 1966 through 1985, the Cowboys never had a losing year.
Twenty consecutive winning seasons is a jawdropper.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that the Seahawks have never had more than three
straight.
</P>
<P>
   OK, bad example from a weak franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Think about this, then: The next best streak is 25 percent in
arrears _ the 16 seasons of Chicago's George Halas.
</P>
<P>
   Only one coach, long-ago Packers boss Curly Lambeau, had a more
impressive tenure: streaks of 14 and 12 seasons, broken by one .500
year.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's Don Shula had 13 in a row, Marty Schottenheimer and
George Allen 12. Vince Lombardi and John Madden had 10 straight.
Hank Stram, Chuck Noll and Halas had nine.
</P>
<P>
   George Seifert's losing season this year at Carolina ended his
run at eight, leaving Holmgren alone at that figure, the longest
streak among active NFL coaches.
</P>
<P>
   In the history of North American pro sports, the Cowboys' streak
is the fourth longest, behind the 29 of the Boston Bruins (1967-68
through 1995-96), and the 39 of the New York Yankees (1926-64) and
the Montreal Canadiens (1951-52 through 1982-83).
</P>
<P>
   But those streaks were completed under multiple managers and
coaches. Landry was there for all 20 seasons when the Cowboys
became America's Team.
</P>
<P>
   In Landry's era, it was easier to keep teams together because
players didn't have nearly the freedom of movement that has altered
the game over the last several years. But the rules were the same
for all of Landry's contemporaries, and none came close to his
relentless ability to excel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are so different now,'' Holmgren said. ``When you built
through the draft, you wanted to know the player was going to be
there for 10 or 12 years. Now, you constantly have to adjust, and
it makes winning more complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren, as with many non-Texans who grew up in the 1960s and
1970s, knew Landry only via his TV image.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked like he was chiseled from granite,'' he said. ``He
had the hat, he was always dapper and had a very impressive
demeanor. People said he was not emotional enough. But having gone
through this myself for a number of years, I think the ability to
think analytically and calmly on the sideline is hugely important.
It showed me tremendous self-discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry, a conservative man of deep faith, also managed to get
the most out of an often-wild group of players whose debaucheries
were the stuff of popular cinema and anathema to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom was so comfortable in his own skin,'' Holmgren said. ``He
would coach, act and live his own way. His faith, I think, was real
important in allowing him to sustain himself when it got goofy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had enough leaders on his teams that were extensions of
him, guys that adopted many of his virtues. That allowed the
`characters' on his team to be handled by the players themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent spate of bad news in the NFL suggests to some an
out-of-control outfit. In fact, the NFL of Landry's era was a much
more reckless, less scrutinized time when abuse of self and others
was more prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   That a man like Landry not only survived the time, but
flourished as no other, is testament to strength of character and
power of will; a standard that should never be lost.

BUDGET ANALYST CRITICIZES LACK OF DETAIL IN DAVIS' STATE
BUDGET  PROPOSAL
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ While predicting that another $4.2 billion will
flood state coffers this year, the Legislature's nonpartisan budget
analyst Thursday criticized the lack of detail in Gov. Gray Davis'
proposed $85 billion budget.
</P>
<P>
   California's ``extraordinarily positive'' economy accounts for
the continuing influx of funds, said Legislative Analyst Elizabeth
Hill. The $4.2 billion is on top of the $5.5 billion surplus Davis
anticipated in the budget he unveiled last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity for both the governor and the
Legislature to strategically invest in our future,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hill said that in her 16 years in office she has rarely seen
a governor's proposed budget that lacks so much detail in such a
wide variety of areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This particular budget is a work in progress that is lacking
the detail the Legislature needs to evaluate programs up-front,''
Hill said. ``It is critical for the Legislature to provide
oversight and determine which proposals have merit and flesh out
the details.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill cited Democrat Davis' ``aging with dignity program,'' the
proposed department of managed care, and an effort to crack down on
Medi-Cal fraud as areas where not enough specifics make her unable
to properly evaluate the proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Gage, the governor's Finance Director, said more details
will come out as the budget moves through the legislative process.
</P>
<P>
   ``All budgets start out with policy goals and the details get
fleshed out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hill took issue with many of Davis' proposed spending plans,
including in the critical areas of education and transportation.
</P>
<P>
   She suggested most of the extra money coming in should be
directed to K-12 education, where the state still lags far behind
the nation in per pupil spending.
</P>
<P>
   Hill criticized the governor for raising the budgets for the
University of California and California State University system 6
percent, while the proposed increase for K-12 and community
colleges was just 2.84 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This raised many questions, especially given the concern about
program quality in K-12,'' she said. Hill recommended shifting
$148.5 million from the higher education budgets to the primary
school system.
</P>
<P>
   Gage defended the governor's higher education spending, saying
he ``feels very strongly about the quality of work that higher
education does.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislative analyst also took direct aim at one of Davis'
signature proposals this year -- an effort to recruit teachers.
Davis has proposed specific financial incentives for teachers who
become nationally certified, teach in low-performing schools or
retired teachers who return to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is that we need more local discretion,'' Hill said.
``I'd suggest a $122 million block grant for teacher recruitment
and retention.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Democrat Carole Migden, chair of the Assembly
Appropriations Committee, said local control is always a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get the Legislature out of the business of the
professionals,'' she said. ``There should be more local
prioritization, but there also has to be a greater line of
accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   On the transportation front, Hill said she thought Davis' plan
to accelerate $3.6 billion in funds for projects would not be
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immediate congestion relief is very unlikely under the
governor's proposal,'' she said. ``There simply aren't enough
projects in the pipeline ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   She said CalTrans would have to hire between 4,000 and 8,000 new
employees to handle the projects, and said the department does not
have a very good track record in this area.
</P>
<P>
   Gage said he was not sure that Hill's numbers are correct, but
said the goal is to encourage local governments to move projects
forward in a timely fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said most of the state's extra revenue is coming from the
personal income tax, especially from the wealthiest 20 percent of
California taxpayers, who are reporting a 30 percent increase in
their capital gains income, mostly from stock market earnings.
</P>
<P>
   She said she expects the numbers to continue to increase, but
``a lot depends on the course of the California economy.''

great man's hand, Landry offered up, for him, an emotional outburst
_ a small smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' he said softly, ``who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren is used to the circle of celebrities, so finding
himself slightly awestruck was unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him how much I admired him,'' he said. ``He said some
nice things to me. It meant a lot. As I was growing up, I admired
him so much as a coach and as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL legend of Landry, who died of leukemia Saturday at 75,
was so immense, it is hard to believe he hasn't coached since 1989,
and that a generation separates him and Holmgren, 51.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Landry was the epitome of the NFL _ a bulwark of
excellence, consistency and stoicism while the American cultural
landscape heaved and twisted.
</P>
<P>
   He was coach of the Dallas Cowboys before John Kennedy assumed
the White House, and lasted until just before the rookie year of
Cortez Kennedy. In that span was an achievement that annually grows
more luminous, particularly in view of a salary cap system that
seems destined to throw good teams into roster chaos almost
annually.
</P>
<P>
   From 1966 through 1985, the Cowboys never had a losing year.
Twenty consecutive winning seasons is a jawdropper.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that the Seahawks have never had more than three
straight.
</P>
<P>
   OK, bad example from a weak franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Think about this, then: The next best streak is 25 percent in
arrears _ the 16 seasons of Chicago's George Halas.
</P>
<P>
   Only one coach, long-ago Packers boss Curly Lambeau, had a more
impressive tenure: streaks of 14 and 12 seasons, broken by one .500
year.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's Don Shula had 13 in a row, Marty Schottenheimer and
George Allen 12. Vince Lombardi and John Madden had 10 straight.
Hank Stram, Chuck Noll and Halas had nine.
</P>
<P>
   George Seifert's losing season this year at Carolina ended his
run at eight, leaving Holmgren alone at that figure, the longest
streak among active NFL coaches.
</P>
<P>
   In the history of North American pro sports, the Cowboys' streak
is the fourth longest, behind the 29 of the Boston Bruins (1967-68
through 1995-96), and the 39 of the New York Yankees (1926-64) and
the Montreal Canadiens (1951-52 through 1982-83).
</P>
<P>
   But those streaks were completed under multiple managers and
coaches. Landry was there for all 20 seasons when the Cowboys
became America's Team.
</P>
<P>
   In Landry's era, it was easier to keep teams together because
players didn't have nearly the freedom of movement that has altered
the game over the last several years. But the rules were the same
for all of Landry's contemporaries, and none came close to his
relentless ability to excel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are so different now,'' Holmgren said. ``When you built
through the draft, you wanted to know the player was going to be
there for 10 or 12 years. Now, you constantly have to adjust, and
it makes winning more complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren, as with many non-Texans who grew up in the 1960s and
1970s, knew Landry only via his TV image.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked like he was chiseled from granite,'' he said. ``He
had the hat, he was always dapper and had a very impressive
demeanor. People said he was not emotional enough. But having gone
through this myself for a number of years, I think the ability to
think analytically and calmly on the sideline is hugely important.
It showed me tremendous self-discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry, a conservative man of deep faith, also managed to get
the most out of an often-wild group of players whose debaucheries
were the stuff of popular cinema and anathema to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom was so comfortable in his own skin,'' Holmgren said. ``He
would coach, act and live his own way. His faith, I think, was real
important in allowing him to sustain himself when it got goofy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had enough leaders on his teams that were extensions of
him, guys that adopted many of his virtues. That allowed the
`characters' on his team to be handled by the players themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent spate of bad news in the NFL suggests to some an
out-of-control outfit. In fact, the NFL of Landry's era was a much
more reckless, less scrutinized time when abuse of self and others
was more prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   That a man like Landry not only survived the time, but
flourished as no other, is testament to strength of character and
power of will; a standard that should never be lost.

AL'S FAVORITE RECORD IS BILL'S
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A New York Times poll says Al Gore is picking up
steam, which is considered good, though picking up steam can lead
to blowing smoke. After inhaling.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason poll respondents gave for liking Gore is the
record of the Clinton administration. Which is fine, except the
administration started gaining momentum in polls about two months
ago, about the time when Gore announced he was abandoning his VP
duties (but not his VP paycheck) to run for Praise-a-dent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore should get credit for the economic upsurge, though, since
he single-handedly shook loose the cash-flow logjam at Buddhist
temples.
</P>
<P>
   In a kind gesture, Clinton praised Gore, saying, ``My experience
is that (Gore) is exceedingly honest and exceedingly
straightforward.''
</P>
<P>
   Next: San Francisco Muni drivers praise Gore for his punctuality
and good humor.
</P>
<P>
   It's funny, but whenever a columnist makes sport of a
politician, people assume it's because the columnist belongs to
another party. But to quote Al Gore, ``I am not part of the
problem. I am a Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   And to quote singer Leslie Gore, ``It's my party and I'll cry if
I want to.''
</P>
<P>
   DOGGIE WOES: The Board of Supes votes next Tuesday on whether to
grant landmark status to the Doggie Diner head on Sloat Blvd.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, says Nevada bizman Jerry Silva. He says he used to
work for Doggie Diner founder Al Ross, and that he (Silva) legally
scooped up the trademark and name after they were abandoned for 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Silva says he has two Doggie Diners in Nevada, five more in the
works, and will soon expand his hot-dog stands in a big way into
California.
</P>
<P>
   He told me he has no problem with the Doggie head staying where
it is, above the Carousel hamburger stand, for now, but: ``The city
of San Francisco is not going to landmark it without a federal
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Planning Commissioner Dennis Antenore told me, ``I don't pretend
to be an expert in this, but it seems far-fetched to say making
something a landmark is an infringement of copyright. I can't say
I'd be shaking in my boots over this guy's rights.''
</P>
<P>
   TURN YOUR HEAD and cough if you walk past the Gold Coast on
lower California Street at Happy Hour.
</P>
<P>
   The Gold Coast has been a prime target of the city's sporadic
attempts to enforce the no-smoking law. Owner Jim Brandt, a
recovering smoker, posts the required signs and has his bartenders
deliver the required lectures, but smoke happens, and now the heat
is on.
</P>
<P>
   So today Brandt will run up a white flag outside the place, and
will burn matchbooks and toss out ashtrays. Bartenders will wear
``Smoke Police'' badges and hand out nicotine patches.
</P>
<P>
   It's another nail in the coffin nail's coffin.
</P>
<P>
   YES, TECHNICALLY, the Museum of the City of San Francisco did
get kicked out of the Cannery.
</P>
<P>
   But credit where it's due: The Cannery gave the museum a
``temporary'' home nine years ago, charged no rent and paid the
museum's PG&AMP;E bills. So thanks a million and a half ($), Cannery.
</P>
<P>
   THEME SUITES are all the rage at many hip Bay Area hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Dinah's Garden in Palo Alto just opened an FDR Memorial suite,
featuring a wheelchair-accessible steam room and a vintage '30s
radio that plays Fireside Chats.
</P>
<P>
   The rate for the room is slightly cheaper since the remodel.
Management calls it the New Deal.
</P>
<P>
   THE SUPER BOWL of penny pitches is kaput.
</P>
<P>
   The annual Penny Pitch at the Washington Square Bar &AMP; Grill,
started about 25 years ago to raise funds for St. Anthony's Dining
Room, won't be held Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Washbag decided not to host the event, and St. Anthony's,
which raked in $5,000 to $10,000 every year to feed the foodless,
didn't get the word in time to find a new venue.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bad week for museums, smoky bars and penny pitches. And
putters (see following).
</P>
<P>
   PING KING dies: Karsten Solheim, a golf club pioneer who
invented the Ping putter, died Wednesday. I assume that flags on
golf greens all over the world are flying at half-staff.
</P>
<P>
   THAT DING-DING ain't a doorbell, lady.
</P>
<P>
   At the Sir Francis Drake Hotel on Powell Street, doorman Tom
Sweeney watched as a woman double-parked her car on the cable car
track while waiting to pick up a hotel guest.
</P>
<P>
   A cable car rumbled up behind her car, and as we all know, cable
car guys are famous for their patience and sweetness when drivers
do dumb stuff. (Note to tourists: The preceding was a jest.)
</P>
<P>
   The gripman clanged his bell and yelled for the woman to move.
She got out of her car, waved her arm and yelled, ``Go around!''

</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-BANK (Moscow) _ A look at the Kremlin connections of
Russian banks named in the guilty plea in the Bank of New York
case. Neither Flamingo nor DKB _ the two Moscow banks that figure
prominently in the fast-unfolding Bank of New York case _ were
really banks at all, say Russian bankers and U.S. investigators.
Rather, they were front companies that gave shelter to ingenuous
schemes for funneling money out of Russia and into one of three
illegal accounts set up at the Bank of New York. By Celestine
Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-ELECT (Tehran, Iran) _ Iran's parliamentary elections on
Friday have emerged as a referendum to define the ideals at the
heart of the Iranian revolution 21 years ago. The vote has become,
as well, a popularity poll for President Mohammad Khatami, the
reformist theologian who was swept into office in 1997 but has yet
to realize much of his liberal social agenda or achieve his stated
goal of improved relations with the United States. By Susan Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL _ GENERAL (Moved in ``a'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   STATES-TAXES-WYO (Cheyenne, Wyo.) _ While most states are
enjoying huge surpluses, a handful are struggling to make ends meet
and contemplating raising taxes rather than looking for ways to
share their largesse with taxpayers. The severity of the problem
varies from state to state, but nowhere is it more acute than here
in Wyoming. With services here already cut to the bone, the state
legislature is wrestling with the unthinkable: new taxes.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-LIVER-DISEASE (Undated) _ A possible new approach to
treating cirrhosis of the liver, the seventh leading cause of death
in the world, has emerged from studies of telomerase, a recently
discovered agent that indefinitely prolongs the life of human cells
grown in the laboratory. So far the treatment has worked only in
mice that have artificially been given cirrhosis. By Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   ALASKA-AVALANCHES (Girdwood, Alaska) _ At least 33 major
avalanches have struck south central Alaska in recent weeks,
bringing a cycle of fury and danger that, even by the Last-Frontier
standards of a state where awesome natural power is continually on
display, has been extraordinary. By Sam Howe Verhovek.

</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN-CHAIRMAN (Greenville, S.C.) _ In their spirited primary
battle, George W. Bush uses the sobriquet ``The Chairman'' to tar
John McCain as a Washington insider. But a close examination of
McCain's record as chairman of the powerful Senate Commerce
Committee shows that he defies easy labeling. He has angered and
perplexed many of the Washington agencies and special interests
that he oversees. His leadership of the commerce panel and style as
chairman are also interesting indicators of how he might lead if he
ever makes it to the White House. By Stephen Labaton.

   CONGRESS-OUTLOOK _ A month into this campaign-compressed
congressional year, it's hard to tell which Congress will emerge:
the incrementally productive one that is working with the White
House to pass a key China trade bill and repeal limits on Social
Security earnings, or the do-nothing one that's fighting Bill
Clinton on taxes, debt relief and his spending plans. An early

<P>
   &UR; BUSINESS DAY _ (Moved in ``f'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FED-GREENSPAN-REACT (Undated) _ When Alan Greenspan speaks, the
old economy trembles. But the new one thinks it is impervious to
higher interest rates, and shrugs off warnings from the Fed
chairman. That has been the pattern since the Fed began to raise
interest rates last summer, and it continued Thursday. Greenspan's
stark warnings that short-term interest rates would continue to
rise had only a brief impact on the Nasdaq composite index, which
is dominated by high-technology companies that are benefiting from
the digital revolution. By Floyd Norris.
</P>
<P>
   REGIONAL-JETS (Undated) _ The battle to attract more air
passengers from smaller markets has become so intense that airlines
are now scrambling to replace their turboprop planes with jets,
giving passengers in smaller markets more flight choices than ever.
Although the average regional jet costs $20 million, nearly double
the price of a comparable turboprop, the airlines feel that the
switch is well worth it. ``Turboprop planes are not an attractive
product,'' said Leo F. Mullin, chief executive of Delta Airlines.
``Passengers view them as second-rate service.'' By David J.
Morrow.

   FACES-EXHIBIT (New York) _ Everyone is cordially invited to a
reception at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It's a daily,
come-as-you-are affair, just a casual little party for friends you
haven't met. Or maybe you have met them. The faces certainly seem
familiar. The prettiest girl from high school is here, and that
smug 10-to-6'er she married. So is a distant, distant cousin, and a
barely remembered college chum, and even an old flame you'd prefer
to forget. And there are strangers who aren't really strangers.
Didn't you see that elderly gent in the subway and brush past that
unisex youth in the street? And who is that woman across the room
with the emerald necklace and stricken face? In fact, they are all

TV'S MILLIONAIRE BRIDEGROOM HAS A PAST IN ENTERTAINMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs for inserts, rewriting) 
 (sw) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Days after marrying, on national television, a woman he had
never met before, Rick Rockwell, identified on the show as a
multimillionaire real estate developer, on Thursday became the talk
of his hometown, San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   It is a city where he is less well known for real estate than
for comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell was the central figure in a Fox television special,
``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'' which drew spectacular
ratings Tuesday night. He appeared in shadows for much of the
telecast while 50 contestants offered themselves as prospective
brides. Rockwell selected Darva Conger, a 34-year-old
emergency-room nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Details about Rockwell began to emerge on Thursday, painting him
as a longtime comic performer, known mainly for elaborate stunts,
like chartering a plane and performing 10-minute stand-up routines
in six cities in one night, telling jokes for 30 straight hours in
an effort to set a Guinness world record, and, most recently,
riding from Los Angeles to Las Vegas on a bicycle to promote a
comedy club.
</P>
<P>
   The last event took place two years ago, said the owner of the
comedy club The Improv, Bud Friedman, who hired him for that stunt.
Mike Fleiss, the show's producer, said on Thursday that he thought
Rockwell had not been a performer since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Fox executives emphasized on Thursday that they were aware
Rockwell had a show-business background and had fully disclosed
that on the show. Indeed, Mike Darnell, the Fox executive who
conceived the idea for the special, said Rockwell's ability to
carry himself well on camera and in front of an audience was one
big reason he was chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Darnell said that almost a hundred millionaires had volunteered
to go through with the bride hunt on the air. But, he said: ``The
perception is basically true: Millionaires are not all good-looking
men. We genuinely opted for a better-looking, charming man.''
</P>
<P>
   Darnell said Rockwell had been thoroughly checked out and
qualified as a multimillionaire. ``That means at least $2
million,'' Darnell said. He added that Fox had seen evidence that
Rockwell had ``at least $750,000 in cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleiss said: ``He struck me as totally honest. I had no
questions about his sincerity. If that was a performance he should
have a couple of Emmy Awards already.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell could not be reached for comment. Fox executives said
he and Conger were in the Caribbean but would not discuss the
location.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell, who was born Richard Balkey in Pittsburgh, listed
himself as a real estate developer and motivational speaker. He has
a Web site where he calls himself a ``corporate comedian.'' On the
site he includes a long list of corporations and groups he has
spoken before, including Johnson &AMP; Johnson and AT&AMP;T and the Joint
Chiefs of Staff. The resume also includes a claim that Rockwell
``opened for Jay Leno in the main room of Caesar's Tahoe.''
</P>
<P>
   A booking representative for Leno said on Thursday that Rockwell
has never opened in Lake Tahoe for Leno.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell has successfully invested in beachfront real estate in
San Diego, with some backing by his father, said Larry Himmel, a
former comedy partner of his who is now a reporter for KFMB-TV in
San Diego. Five Realtor associations in San Diego had not heard of
him.
</P>
<P>
   KFMB broadcast an interview on Thursday night with a woman named
Gina Ord, who identified herself as a former girlfriend. Ord told
the station that she broke off the relationship with Rockwell six
months ago, and that he wanted to get back together but she was
unsure. She also said she spoke with Rockwell two days before the
show was taped and he said he was doing the show only to advance
his career as a comedian and motivational speaker. She said he also

   Rockwell was best known in San Diego for his portrayal of
Skippy, a dimwitted beach bum, on a sketch comedy program on KFMB
in the 1980s. Station officials described the show as a ``poor

Himmel. The running theme, the station officials said, was ``two
surfer dudes who couldn't get dates.''

 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Top-ranked Cincinnati staved off a late rush by the University
of Houston and its own shortcomings at the free-throw line,
increasing the nation's longest winning streak to 16 games with a
77-65 victory Thursday night at Hofheinz Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   The Bearcats wrapped up their fifth straight regular-season
Conference USA title (including a share with Memphis in 1996)
despite missing a possibly fatal 16 of 31 free throws. Center
Kenyon Martin, in yet another all-around performance, had 26
points, 17 rebounds and five blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we're sitting complaining,'' Cincinnati coach Bob Huggins
said, ``and the guy (Martin) has a game like this. We should all be
so lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior guard Gee Gervin matched Martin's 26 points for the
Cougars (8-16 overall, 2-9 C-USA), who lost their sixth in a row.
Gervin helped UH reduce a 20-point deficit late in the first half
to 72-65 with 2:43 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gee Gervin happened'' was Martin's explanation of the Cougars'
rush from a 24-6 deficit. ``He made some great shots, and some
others made great plays. We didn't keep the intensity the way we
started the game, but we were able to stay on top.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bearcats (24-1, 12-0) got 19 points from freshman DerMarr
Johnson. For UH, Roy Spears had a career-high 13 points, while
George Williams and Kenny Younger each had 11 points and 10
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their strong finish, the Cougars couldn't overcome their
10-of-35 (28.6 percent) first-half shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a little uptight at the start,'' said Gervin. ``I
missed some shots in the first half that I know I usually knock
down all day long. It was real draining to get that far down. I
think we kind of over-respected Kenyon Martin.''
</P>
<P>
   If indeed they did, the Cougars had good reason. Martin, despite
missing 10 of 18 free throws, accounted for seven straight points
in a key three-minute stretch after a 17-5 rally by the Cougars
midway through the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who scored the Bearcats' first eight points and had 12
at halftime, pretty much exemplified his team's attitude about the
C-USA title. ``A conference championship is expected of us. It's no
big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   What was a big deal was how Huggins felt about his team's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play harder than that in practice,'' Huggins said. ``We
didn't do the things we wanted to do, didn't defend well, gave
things up that we don't normally do, get up early and then don't
run our offense. They know if they play like that, I'll run them
the next day until they puke. They're more concerned right now than
I am. We're happy to win championships. That's what we play the
regular season for. I'd feel a lot better if we had played
better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bearcats, who won their first three C-USA games against UH
by 83 total points, fell off to 33.3 percent shooting in the second
half. With Spears (six assists and 13 points) taking over the
ball-handling from Gervin, the Cougars were able at times to get
their running game in gear. And Williams helped hold Cincinnati's
Pete Mickeal to 0-for-9 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference was our poor shooting in the first half,'' said
UH coach Clyde Drexler. ``We got our looks, but we couldn't knock
down the shots. Then we outplayed the No. 1 team in the country in
the second half. We were on our heels a little too much early.
Maybe we respected the shot-blocking of Kenyon and the others a
little too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson scored two quick baskets to start the second half, but
the Cougars responded by making six of their first eight
second-half shots. Gervin sandwiched a 15-footer and a 3-pointer
around a free throw by Martin to cut the lead to 53-41.
</P>
<P>
   But the attempted rally was quickly stifled. Jermaine Tate made
the first of two free throws, the Bearcats rebounded his miss on
the second one, and Martin sank a turnaround jumper. Martin then
hit a basket with one foot just inside the 3-point line, then
stuffed in another shot to complete a 7-0 run in 80 seconds and
make the lead 60-41.
</P>
<P>
   But even after Martin's remarkable stuff off a miss by Fletcher,
when Martin switched the rebound from one hand to another in an
instant, the Cougars made another run. It was keyed by Younger's
three-point play and a fast-break layup, and two baskets by Gervin,
narrowing the lead to 65-58 with 7:26 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Martin stemmed the tide with a putback of a loose ball
underneath, then added two free throws while missing four others.
He then had a three-point play for a seemingly safe 72-58 margin
with 4:03 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cougars made one more run. Gervin's floater, Spears'
jumper and Gervin's 3-pointer cut the lead to 72-65 with 2:43 to
go, but there was no more left for the sellout crowd of 8,917,
which was watching UH play host to a No. 1 team for the first time
since 1968, when the Cougars beat UCLA at the Astrodome.

 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
DERMARR Johnson needed but three shots and 74 seconds to give
Cincinnati's Bearcats an arguably insurmountable 8-0 lead over the
Houston Cougars on Thursday night.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He gently floated in a pair of treys from the left wing, then
split the UH defense with a graceful gliding drive up the gut that
reminded all in attendance at Hofheinz Pavilion of a young
you-know-who.
</P>
<P>
   The name Drexler ring a bell?
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is only a freshman, but he's not just any freshman,
having won Parade magazine's Player of the Year honor in his final
high school season. Such is the eminent stature of Bob Huggins'
high-flying program these days that a DerMarr Johnson picks
Cincinnati over everybody else, the NBA included.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where Houston, the city, will next see him again,
most likely. So, yes, it was a special treat to have Bob's Cats in
town for the evening, although the aforementioned Clyde Drexler,
having already had to swallow five consecutive defeats, might not
readily agree. Clyde isn't easily star-struck, you see, because he
was a mega-sized one himself back when the likes of the precocious
Johnson and the amazing Kenyon Martin (26 points, 17 rebounds, five
blocked shots) were toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars collectively needed more than nine minutes to equal
DerMarr Da Man's rapid-fire offensive output at the outset, and by
then Cincy had scored 24. Such deficits are a tad difficult to
overcome against anyone, and although the Cougars tried their
absolute darnedest, twice closing the spread to seven points in the
final 7{ minutes, they succumbed 77-65.
</P>
<P>
   But, like, what did you expect? The 24-1 Bearcats, who might be
as good as the Clippers, the Bulls or the Warriors when they stay
interested in the business at hand for a full 40 minutes, are
ranked No. 1 in the country and figure to remain there unless
somebody ambushes them during March Madness.
</P>
<P>
   They dwarf the Conference USA competition, the Cougars included.
</P>
<P>
   As Johnson said, when asked about the Cats' having clinched
another conference title: ``That was expected of us. It's no big
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Until at least the Sweet 16 cut, they will be playing against
only themselves and the demons of the last three seasons, when
Huggins went 0-3 while trying to get out of the second round in the
NCAA Tournament. But those Bearcats teams weren't nearly as
proficient, or as a deep, as this one.
</P>
<P>
   Its only blemish thus far was a 66-64 loss at cross-town rival
Xavier, which, not coincidentally, shot 17 more free throws (and
made 13 more) than the Cats did. Hence, Xavier can call itself the
Queen City champion for 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
   The home-cooked Bearcats, 16-0 since being X-ed out, will have
to channel their anger and keep trying to find solace in their
quest for the school's first national championship in almost four
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars? Well, if Drexler ever for a moment thought his
foray into coaching was going to go as smoothly as his playing
tenure did, he miscalculated a bit. Losing the national title to
North Carolina State hurt terribly, to be sure, but he would kill
to get anywhere near that far again. To date, there's no tangible
light at the end of the tunnel. At 8-16, Clyde's ``sophomore'' team
is just one defeat shy of equaling the loss total of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Losing active center William Stringfellow, an academic casualty,
doomed these Cougars before the fact to an uphill struggle against
middling opponents, never mind the likes of Cincinnati and an
earlier elite Hofheinz guest, UConn's defending NCAA champion
Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   UH had played pretty much everybody beatably close before the
Cats came a-callin' _ Connecticut included, thanks to a frantic
late surge eerily similar to the one they mounted this night _ but
Clyde's cigars have been a precious few.
</P>
<P>
   Hope springs eternal, nonetheless, as long as he can make
himself stay patient and draw strength from joyous interludes like
the 17-5 run the Cougars put together in the middle of the second
half. Milby's Alton Ford surely will be an impact addition next
season.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball programs can turn around quickly, certainly when the
motivation level is high. Drexler deserves a measure of credit for
inspiring his lads. The better the opponent, it would appear, the
harder the Cougars are willing to fight.
</P>
<P>
   They fear no one _ except perhaps themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We outplayed the No. 1 team in the country in the second
half,'' Drexler said. ``That's a pretty good effort. We're the one
team in our conference, I think, that has the potential to get
better every night. I hope we can take something from this and
build momentum for the rest of the season. We're capable of winning
our last five games.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. The Cougars again reminded us they aren't short of
heart, hustle or chutzpah. Just manpower.

 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
SAN ANTONIO _ In another world, in another time, Shandon Anderson
might have ended up strolling the River Walk, sipping margaritas
and playing for the defending NBA champion Spurs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But as the Rockets prepare to take the Alamodome floor tonight
to face the Spurs, Anderson has no regrets about signing with the
Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   When Sean Elliott underwent kidney-transplant surgery after last
year's march to their first NBA title, the Spurs began a search for
a replacement _ someone who could play small forward, play defense
and fit into their system without demanding a big piece of the
offense. The guy they targeted was Anderson, whose brother, Willie,
spent a good portion of his career playing in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   It had to be tempting. Had he signed with San Antonio, Anderson
would have been on a first-place team. And he would be playing with
Tim Duncan, whom many believe to be the league's best player.
</P>
<P>
   But had he signed with the Spurs, Anderson, 26, doesn't think he
would be having as much fun as he is now, and he doesn't think the
future is quite as bright in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely feels good,'' Anderson said. ``That's the reason
I came here, to play a big role on the team. To have games when I'm
scoring or passing the ball and we win, that's a positive. I
understood the situation before I got into it. I made the decision
late in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it would be a rebuilding stage once Dream (Hakeem
Olajuwon) and (Charles) Barkley left. There would be a transition.
I didn't think we would just explode and it would happen overnight.
I wanted to just be patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think my role (with the Spurs) would have been
expanded as much as it has been here. I think this is a young team
where we have room to grow. We have a core with this team that will
probably be together for a number of years. I feel that my role
here has expanded out as opposed to if I had gone there to play.''
</P>
<P>
   And his role has expanded.
</P>
<P>
   In Utah, Anderson played with ``The Mailman,'' a nickname Karl
Malone earned because of his relentless ability to deliver, night
in and night out. With the Rockets, Anderson, 6-6, has been more
like FedEx _ when you absolutely, positively have to have
something, that's when he delivers.
</P>
<P>
   Like Tuesday's game against the Pistons. With the Detroit
defense keying on point guard Steve Francis, the Rockets
absolutely, positively needed someone to step into the scoring
void. And Anderson obliged, helping to offset Detroit's All-Star
duo of Grant Hill and Jerry Stackhouse by finishing with 25 points
and four assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the way the game goes sometimes,'' said Anderson,
who averages 10.8 points per game. ``Sometimes if a guy is playing
well, the other team's defense is going to try and shut you down,
so while it's going to take away from what you're doing, it's going
to open up a lot of things for your teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Steve hasn't been getting a lot of looks of late, because
defenses have been keying on him. But that's opened up everything
for everyone else. Like some games when the defense keys on me, I'm
not going to get the looks, but that's just the way the game
goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially for Anderson, who has a knack for having big games
when the Rockets really need one. After focusing on defense against
the Los Angeles Lakers (scoring just five points while chasing Kobe
Bryant) and Charlotte (six points while playing Eddie Jones),
Anderson came back the next game and zapped Philadelphia for a
career-high 32 points.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever is needed on any given night, that's what Anderson
provides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal with him is that you're going to get a guy who's
going to put in a hard day's work no matter what the circumstances
are,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said of Anderson. ``He's
giving it his all on every possession on both ends of the court.''

WALK REMAINS VIVID FOR MAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob May remembers walking up a pathway leading to the clubhouse
at Riviera Country Club 15 years ago as a 16-year-old Los Angeles
Open qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   He was just a sophomore at Los Altos High when he played in his
first professional tournament. But there have been a lot of changes
for May since. He's a 31-year-old father of a young son and the
reigning British Masters champion. But not so many that he's
forgotten the feeling of that long-ago walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that sticks out in my mind most was all of the
people standing around and watching,'' he said after shooting a
one-over-par 72 in Thursday's first round of the $3.1 million
Nissan Open. ``You would think it was (Arnold) Palmer or Tiger
Woods or John Daly getting ready to hit. The balcony was solid
people ... it was really neat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I was that nervous. When you're that young, it's
not so much you're nervous, I don't think you know any better.
You're just excited.''
</P>
<P>
   His parents, Jerry and Muriel, who live in La Habra Bob now
resides in Las Vegas with his wife and son remember being stuck in
traffic on the Golden State Freeway and people were rolling down

Jerry remembers youths wearing T-shirts displaying the message `Go
Bob' as they made their way around Riviera Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Muriel jokingly said she did ``most of my aging'' as she waited
for Bob to tee off. Mesa Verde Country Club head professional Tom
Sargent, who has worked with May for the past four years, remembers
Bob shooting a 29 in a nine-hole practice round with Mark O'Meara,
and O'Meara asking the young prodigy, ``Are you trying to win this
thing?''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry, caddying for his son that day, watched Bob bogey his
first of four consecutive holes to start the round and suddenly had
second thoughts about being out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had sweaty palms and everything,'' he said with a laugh.
``You want your kids to do well, no matter what they do. I remember
feeling like, `How did I get involved in this? This is
gut-wrenching.' You're not certain if you're doing the right thing
and putting more pressure on a youngster.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went on to bogey the third hole and the fourth hole, then
he righted himself and shot one over par for the day. That was
pretty respectable. I had a good feeling at the end of the day.''
</P>
<P>

British Masters.
</P>
<P>
   He missed several makeable birdie putts Thursday including three
inside 10 feet _ and struggled through a four-hole stretch on the
back nine in which he did not hit the fairway with his normally
reliable driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I hit the ball pretty well today,'' he said. ``I gave
myself chances, but I didn't hole anything. I told my caddy, `It's
not like I'm putting bad. I'm just not finding the right line.' ''

USC FALLS TO ARIZONA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ Deja vu in the desert?
</P>
<P>
   USC certainly thought so Thursday night, with visions of
completing a totally unexpected sweep of fourth-ranked Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike last month's upset at the Sports Arena, the Trojans
couldn't make the big play when they needed to, and lost to the
Wildcats 92-85 before 14,531 at McKale Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (13-10, 6-5) had their chances, making the sellout
crowd nervous in the final minute, but failed to sweep Arizona
(22-4, 11-1) for the first time since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   After Brandon Granville hit a 3-pointer to cut Arizona's lead to
88-85 with one minute remaining, Jeff Trepagnier stripped Wildcats
forward Michael Wright of the ball with 41.1 seconds left, and
Brian Scalabrine recovered to set up a potential game-tying shot.
</P>
<P>
   But Trepagnier's 3-point attempt with 23 seconds left bounced
off the rim and then the backboard, depriving USC of a chance to
stun the Wildcats on their homecourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wide open,'' Trepagnier said. ``I just didn't knock it
down. It's real tough because we're trying to get a win and when
something doesn't go our way, it really affects us.''
</P>
<P>
   It was another oh-so-close performance for the Trojans, who need
actual victories. USC has lost five of its past six games, and now
must win five of its final seven contests for a chance at making
the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like every game we're feeling as if we would have won
if we had just made a shot,'' Scalabrine said. ``But we lose by a
couple points.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine had a career-high 28 points and eight rebounds,
despite playing nearly all of the final nine minutes with four
fouls. Trepagnier had 20 points and 14 rebounds, and Granville had
21 points and 11 assists.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to keep USC coach Henry Bibby uncritical of his
team, though clearly distraught over the missed opportunity to
upset Arizona for the second time in less than four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have thought that? We were in the ballgame,'' Bibby
said. ``We had a chance to win at the end. I can't ask for any more
than that. We were just a little bit short here and there.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly as surprising as the Trojans' ability to keep things
close was the play of freshman center Kostas Charissis, who had
career-highs in points (nine), rebounds (eight), assists (four) and
minutes (33).
</P>
<P>
   It all explained how the Trojans led for virtually the entire
first half, and kept things close throughout the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stayed in the game and gave ourselves a chance tonight.
They're good, strong, smart, quick and athletic ... and we hung
with them,'' Bibby said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the Trojans didn't win was the poor performance of
forward David Bluthenthal, who had seven points and six rebounds
including zero rebounds in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona was led by its guards. Former Grant High star Gilbert
Arenas had a team-high 21 points, and point guard Jason Gardner had
19 points, eight rebounds and six assists.
</P>
<P>
   Wildcats center Loren Woods had 17 points, but no blocked shots.
Woods, who tied an NCAA record with 14 blocks against Oregon, has
been bothered by a sore back.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: It was the briefest media boycott in history. USC coach
Henry Bibby told forward Brian Scalabrine before the game not to
talk to the media for the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby has been bothered by some of Scalabrine's recent comments
regarding whether USC's players have experienced fatigue,
especially a remark that Bibby did not allow the players to get
tired.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby has instituted media bans for players before, but they
usually didn't last long. But this one was the shortest.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Bibby changed his mind. ``I don't care,'' he
said, and Scalabrine was allowed to speak to a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona forward Richard Jefferson had a boot removed from his
broken right foot Thursday and has been cleared by doctors to begin
practicing. He will not play this weekend and is expected back in
two weeks. Jefferson has been out since Jan. 8, the opening week of
Pac-10 play.
</P>
<P>
   USC freshman center Luke Minor, who is redshirting, was brought
on the trip by Bibby. Minor has begun practicing again after
undergoing foot surgery several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Brandon Granville moved into fifth place on USC's
all-time assists list.

HAYES LEADS NISSAN OPEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ J.P. Hayes flew with the eagles Thursday _ real
and virtual _ and sailed into undisputed first place in the Nissan
Open at Riviera Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th-year pro, who finished 7-under-par 64 as one of the
last players to tee off in the opening round, actually took over
the lead with three birdies in a four-hole stretch on the back
nine.
</P>
<P>
   That moved him first past Neal Lancaster, Mark Brooks, Bob Tway
and Jeff Freeman (then sharing second place at 66), then clubhouse
leader Robin Freeman (65), all of whom had finished much earlier.
But it was Hayes' eagle-birdie start that got his round flying.``It
was my best start ever,'' Hayes said of going 3-under par through
the first two holes. ``No.1 (503 yards, par 5) is a hole you want
to birdie, and I got eagle. No.2 (463 yards, par 4 into the wind)
is a hole you just want to par and I got birdie, so it felt like an
eagle.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Hayes did something that left him just as satisfied: He
played the last 16 holes at 2 under par and didn't waste the flying
start.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was almost more impressive,'' he said, ``because it shows
consistency throughout my round.''
</P>
<P>
   He wound up the most-consistent player on a day of consistency,
as 85 players bettered par and 39 of them shot in the 60s in
perfect weather conditions and with the lift, clean and place rule
in effect after Wednesday's rainstorm left the course soft and
damp.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, second in this tournament the past two years and
regarded as the player to beat in just about every event he enters,
joined 10 others, including Vijay Singh and Jim Furyk, at 68.
Another group of 10 was bunched at 67, including Nick Price and
course record-holder Ted Tryba.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Ernie Els, Ryder Cup sparkplug Hal Sutton and
former PGA champion Jeff Sluman finished in a pack of 14 at 69 as
the field of 144 set itself up for a scrambling cut day today, when
only the top half of the two-round scores and ties qualifies for
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said shooting low will be a high priority today, since
rain is expected to return for the weekend hard rain on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``With that forecast in mind,'' Woods said, ``we need to somehow
shoot some good numbers so we can somehow put ourselves in position
for that day. Because if it's going to be like that and you hit a
few drives off line, it's going to be pretty tough out here.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed pretty easy for the Freeman brothers Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   PGA Tour veteran Robin grabbed the early lead at 6-under-par 65
and younger brother Jeff _ the two-time defending Southern
California PGA Section champion and reigning national club pro
champion _ finished soon after at 66.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of a late bloomer,'' said Jeff Freeman, 37, a
teaching pro at Tamarisk Country Club in Rancho Mirage. ``But it
really helped me to play in the U.S. Open last year. It helped me
in course management. ``We never had a big rivalry _ we pull for
each other so hard. I hope he breaks out soon.'' Robin Freeman, 40,
a 17-year golf professional who has never won a PGA Tour event, is
bidding for his best finish since placing second in the 1995 Byron
Nelson Classic.
</P>
<P>
   He joked that he's looking forward and backward at the same
time, with his younger brother in such close pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like he's trying to catch me,'' Robin said. ``I hope
he does.'' Brooks, who has not won since his PGA Championship in
1996, said putts are the only part of his game that is missing
right now.``I've been playing OK for a while,'' he said. ``Just
need to make some more putts.''
</P>
<P>
   Price, a two-time PGA champion and 1994 British Open winner,
headed for Riviera with more problems than putting: ``I was about
ready to file an autopsy report on my game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he took a tuneup with instructor David Leadbetter and
came out firing in his first PGA Tour start of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through a bit of down, but I'm definitely on the way
up,'' he said. He'll need it to beat the crowd today and the
weather on the weekend.

ARIZONA STATE ROUTS UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ NIT, or no NIT?
</P>
<P>
   After a heartless performance in a game they desperately needed,
the UCLA Bruins are face-to-disgrace with the reality they hoped to
avoid: missing the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a stunning (but not impossible) turnaround, the Bruins
have three weeks to decide if they'll accept an NIT bid.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the NIT might not want them after Thursday's
embarrassing 104-75 loss at Arizona State before 10,036 at Wells
Fargo Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils led by 13 points early, 19 midway through the
first half and 23 midway through the second in defeating UCLA for
the first time in 23 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to take everybody's best punch,'' Bruins guard
Rico Hines said. ``They are going to come at us like, `UCLA's down
this year, so let's go at them.' Especially when you beat a team 22
straight times.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a hungry cat, and we just sat down. We just gave
up.''
</P>
<P>
   It was UCLA's worst loss ever to Arizona State, but not its
worst loss ever. In coach Steve Lavin's three-plus seasons, the
Bruins have lost to Stanford by 48 points, North Carolina by 41 and
Duke by 36.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost like this before,'' guard Earl Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, ASU isn't Duke or North Carolina. The Sun Devils
have one player, guard Eddie House, who could start for UCLA. They
have an average frontline, a freshman point guard and no McDonald's
All-Americans. (UCLA has three.)
</P>
<P>
   And yet the Bruins were outcoached, outhustled, outrebounded and
outplayed [-] especially by House, whose 40 points are the most
against UCLA since Wyoming's Fennis Dembo scored 41 in the 1987
NCAA Tournament. Afterward, House, a senior, rejoiced in his first
victory over the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to answer that anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the Bruins went six possessions (four turnovers,
two air balls) without hitting the rim. They were leaderless, they
were directionless, they were careless (24 turnovers) and they were
clueless. Alicia Silverstone would have been proud. Then
again..((elipsises))..
</P>
<P>
   ``They thoroughly dominated us,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin said.
``Obviously, they were on their A game. I'm disappointed we didn't
bring our A-level game ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, they're headed for an F [-] as in, failure to make the NCAA
Tournament. The last time that happened, 1988, they fired coach
Walt Hazzard.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, at 13-10 overall [-] (ital) yes, 13-10!!off! [-]
and 4-7 in Pac-10 play, the Bruins are harrowingly close to their
first losing record in conference play since 1948.
</P>
<P>
   They have little time to regroup, what with Saturday's game at
No. 4 Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to show some maturity and flush this loss,'' Hines
said. ``There's no need to sulk, but we have to do some
soul-searching.''
</P>
<P>
   It was apparent from the start that House would not repeat his
5-of-17 shooting performance in last month's loss in Pauley
Pavilion. Hescored 16 points in the first eight minutes against
UCLA's man-to-shadow defense. His 3-pointer from the right wing
with 12 midway through the first half gave the Sun Devils a 25-12
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was due to get 30 or 40,'' said UCLA guard Ray Young, who
played against House in high school in the Bay Area. ``I told
everybody that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kapono rallied the Bruins with back-to-back 3-pointers,
and Dan Gadzuric's short turnaround closed the deficit to 29-22
with eight minutes remaining in the half.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing three minutes, the Bruins committed four
turnovers (Gadzuric, Ryan Bailey, Gadzuric, Matt Barnes) and shot
two air balls (Young, Hines). They were as disjointed and
dysfunctional, impatient and inefficient Thursday as they were in
the disastrous second-half at Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy with the way we counterpunched,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time reserve Sean Farnham made a free throw with 4:53
left, the Sun Devils had scored 12 consecutive points and extended
their seven-point lead to 19.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were no better after halftime. They continued to take
dumb shots and make stupid passes and play half-hearted defense. It
was so bad that Watson fouled out with 14 minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   A few possessions later, Hines was slapped with a technical foul
for bumping House out of bounds. Although excessive, it was UCLA's
first display of spirit of the game. They trailed by 20 at the
time.

NORTHRIDGE BEATEN IN OVERTIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MISSOULA, Mont. _ They kept playing and playing, back and forth,
back and forth, and toward the end of it looked like they might
settle this thing on one of the concrete courts outside the arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Cal State Northridge men's basketball team certainly wanted
more time, and then coach Bobby Braswell could have waved a magic
wand and put in his three top scorers to make another run at
Montana.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We end the game, and we've got our three best players on the
bench, fouled out,'' Braswell said after the Grizzlies outlasted
the Matadors 73-70 in an overtime thriller Thursday night in front
of 4,925 at Adams Center. ``It's disheartening. Our guys played
extremely hard. I don't know what to tell them.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The players) did what they needed to do fight back and get
this game to overtime,'' he said. ``And then we get to overtime and
we don't get to the free-throw line. (the Grizzlies) get to the
free-throw line... they were six for eight (from the line) in
overtime. We didn't get thereat all.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Braswell let out a breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we didn't play hard enough to get fouled. That's just
the way it goes,'' he said, sarcasm dripping with every word and
frustration with the officiating evident.
</P>
<P>
   With five Big Sky Conference games left, Northridge is in
trouble. CSUN(14-8, 6-5) dropped its second consecutive game and a
spot in the Big Sky standings, down to fourth after Northern
Arizona's win over Montana State Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN plays at Montana State in Bozeman tonight; the team
traveled by bus after Thursday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for everybody to step up two or three notches,''
said senior forward Andre Larry, who had a team-high 19 points
before fouling out with 59.8 seconds left. ``I'm going to do what I
can do to win basketball games. It's getting down to crunch time.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he fouled out, Larry (13.3 points per game) didn't even
have a chance to help the Matadors pull it out. He wasn't alone.
Jeff Parris (11.6 ppg) was the first to foul out, with 2:16 left in
the second half. He was followed by Brian Heinle (16.0), who left
just 51 seconds into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Montana, which won its third in a row and improved to 9-3 in the
Big Sky and 14-9 overall, faced a CSUN lineup in the last four
minutes that Braswell would start only in an intrasquad game:
Markus Carr, Carl Holmes,Denny Ogden, Hewitt Rolle and Dan Read.
</P>
<P>
   Among those five, Carr, Holmes and Rolle are starters. Read is a
backup center who plays less than five minutes a game. Ogden is a
walk-on shooting guard who had a season-high nine points Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got key guys that are fouling out when they shouldn't be
fouling out,'' said Holmes, who had 13 points and made it to the
finish. ``We've got guys that need to keep their composure in the
game. I'm not going to come out, and Markus is not going to come
out, and score 25 points every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes is right. He and Carr, a playmaker who is eighth in the
nation in assists per game, are not the go-to guys on offense.
Those are Heinle,Parris and Larry.
</P>
<P>
   Heinle had his second consecutive game in single-digit scoring
(eight) and Parris only had nine. The Matadors shot 36.2 percent
and managed only 25 points in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Montana went 10 minutes without a field goal in the second half
but the Grizzlies never trailed by more than one in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't do too much, even though we won,'' said Montana's
Matt Williams, a conference MVP candidate who had 24 points and 17
rebounds. ``We really lost our composure and tensed up with their
pressure.''

BROOKS COULD BE BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The tee-to-green aspect of golf has never been a
tremendous riddle for Mark Brooks, but rolling the ball into the
cup has posed a much greater challenge in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks will never be considered one of the tour's big hitters,
which puts a greater emphasis on his short game. He won the 1996
PGA Championship but has made infrequent appearances on the
leaderboard since then and at one point missed the cut in five
consecutive majors.
</P>
<P>
   With a seventh-place finish in San Diego last weekend, and a
5-under 66 which left him tied for third place following Thursday's
first round, Brooks might be ready to be a tour force once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of making putts or not, that's a lot of
it,'' said Brooks, who finished tied for 91st in putting average
last year. He started his round Thursday with seven consecutive
pars, then birdied five of the next eight holes. On holes 13, 14
and 15, he hit three solid approach shots and made 15-foot putts
for birdie each time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shooting 70 isn't going to get you very far out here,'' Brooks
said. ``If you're not putting well, you're not going to get in the
mid-60s, and that's really where you need to be to win.''
</P>
<P>
   A big lift: The recent rainstorm allowed players to compete
under lift, clean and place rules in the first round, although the
course recovered well from Wednesday's downpour.
</P>
<P>
   ``On some of the elevated fairways, like 3 and 18, it was just
fine,'' said Robin Freeman, who is in second place following a
6-under 65. ``The water drained out pretty well on those, but on
holes like 10, 11 and 12 there was quite a bit of mud on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it was a good call, but to take advantage of it you have to
drive in the fairway. I only missed two fairways today and that
makes a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the course played more than 100 yards shorter than
organizers' original intentions. Holes 9 and 12, which were
lengthened this year, went back to their original lengths. No. 9
went from a planned 465 yards to its original 418, and No. 12 went
back to 413 from 471.
</P>
<P>
   Tour officials said the the length of the two holes will be
determined on a day-to-day basis and will be based on player
feedback and course conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The course recovered well from this week's inclement weather,
but the fans were not as lucky as the players.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the cart paths and grass walkways contained some
amount of mud, making the course more difficult to negotiate than a
15-foot downhill putt in some places.
</P>
<P>
   Flip-flop Fred: Fred Couples' career has featured a series of
peaks and valleys over the past few years, marked by injury and
inconsistent play with streaks of brilliance mixed in.
</P>
<P>
   Couples, a longtime fan favorite in Los Angeles who won the
tournament in 1990 and 1992, tied for fifth last week in San Diego
but once again struggled with inconsistency in Thursday's round.
</P>
<P>
   Couples birdied the par-5 first hole but bogeyed No.2. Two more
bogeys left him 2-over at the turn, but birdies on 10 and 17
brought him back to even. On the 18th, however, Couples missed the
green to the left and missed an eight-footer for par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play all that well,'' Couples said. ``It's nice to
play here. The weather is nice, the course is nice, but I shot
1-over and that's about all I can say.''
</P>
<P>
   Back-nine blues: Ernie Els stood at 4-under after a birdie at
No.10 but bogeyed Nos. 12 and 15 and needed a tricky six-foot putt
on No.18 to finish with a 2-under 69.
</P>
<P>
   Els had six feet left for birdie on No. 18 after a strong second
shot but slid the downhill putt to the right of the hole and barely
avoided a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good chance for birdie and then I ended up being happy
to walk away with a par,'' said Els, the tournament's defending
champion. ``The back nine played longer than last year and when
that sea breeze comes in, it gets a little difficult.''

FINALLY, SUTTON IS BACK IN SWING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hal Sutton was paired with Tiger Woods Thursday in
the first round of the Nissan Open. Time was when that would have
been a prescription for disaster, like locking a claustrophobic in
a broom closet or moving a triskaidekaphobic into a 13th-floor
penthouse apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Expecting Sutton to perform in front of a crowd spilling into
the thousands as recently as a few years ago would have been akin
to asking someone who suffers from acute stage fright to be a
presenter at the Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah,'' Sutton said after touring Riviera Country Club in
2-under-par 69. ``A few years ago, that would have been a pairing
that I would not have been excited about.''
</P>
<P>
   It would have been less a walk in the park for Sutton than a
walk down a plank. His swing in those days was a stranger to him.
He didn't trust it as far as he could pivot.
</P>
<P>
   He'd stand over a golf ball and storm clouds would gather inside
his head. He recently said he felt like ``it was raining a
three-foot circle, just around me.''
</P>
<P>
   From No. 1 on the money list in 1983, Sutton plummeted 184 spots
in nine years' time. He had fallen and he couldn't get up.
</P>
<P>
   After winning seven times on tour in his first five years
</P>
<P>
   including the 1983 PGA Championship on the same course he
traversed Thursday Sutton went the next eight years without a
victory. The man once pegged as the next Jack Nicklaus was well on
his way to becoming the next Ian Baker-Finch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was doing some things technically wrong,'' Sutton said. ``I
had to get those things straightened out. If you don't get your
swing on a correct plane, you're not going to play good.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton, 41, went through swing teachers like buckets of range
balls. His ball-striking got so bad, he dreaded being seen on the
practice range. He felt like everyone was looking at him,
wondering, Who's that duffer masquerading as Hal Sutton?
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like that was me, the way I was hitting it and I
hated to exhibit it like that,'' Sutton said. ``It might have been
more in my mind than anybody else's but yeah, I felt very
self-conscious.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 Floyd Horgen, who had coached Sutton at Louisiana's
Centenary College, saw a videotape of Sutton's swing and phoned him
to offer a few suggestions. They hadn't been talkng long when
Sutton conceded his confidence was at a low ebb.
</P>
<P>
   One call led to buckets upon buckets of balls as Horgen helped
Sutton strip away all the varnish to expose his natural swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The framework of his swing was there,'' said Horgen, who had
retired to Montana shortly before he hooked up again with Sutton.
``He was just overdoing things. There's a lot of stuff in golf
where a little bit is good but a lot is not better.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before Sutton saw signs of progress. He posted
two second-place finishes in 1994, his best results in five years.
That same year he married the former Ashley Powell. Finally, it
seemed, he was getting his groove back on and off the course.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, playing on a one-year Tour exemption, Sutton
won the B.C. Open. He went without a victory the next two years but
won twice in 1998 and finished fifth on the money list, earning
$1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton won the Canadian Open last September but that's not what
made the month among his most memorable. Two weeks later in Boston,
Sutton, who was playing in the Ryder Cup for the first time in 14
years, delivered a stirring speech the night before the final
matches.
</P>
<P>
   He went out and won his singles match against Darren Clarke the
next day to help lead the U.S. to a come-from-behind win over
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you, Hal's presence was so strong all week, he was
our stanchion,'' said Ben Crenshaw, the captain of the U.S. team.
``Golly, he played well. He provided a lot of strength for the rest
of us.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday it was a Ryder Cup reunion, with Sutton, Woods and
Steve Pate playing to the largest following on the course. Sutton
was causing almost as much a commotion as Woods, winning a vocal
following among the fans as he whittled strokes off par.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton stood 4-under-par through 14 holes. But he bogeyed No.
15, watched a birdie putt curl around the cup at No. 17 and two-
putted 18 for another bogey to put a damper on his day.
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually it didn't detract too much from his enjoyment.
Sutton has come too far to get down on himself now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just fun to be able to play alongside the best player in
the world and match shot for shot with him,'' Sutton said. ``I look
forward to these pairings now.''

LANCASTER HAS FOUND HIS GROOVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Neal Lancaster thinks he finally has this golf
thing figured out.
</P>
<P>
   His secret: The worse his swing feels, the better it is.
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster doesn't try to argue the logic, just the results. It's
all so backwards, and all so right. No matter how awkward his new
swing feels, the ball sails true.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the shot leaves, I'm like, `I can't believe it's going
there,''' Lancaster said.
</P>
<P>
   It went true more than not Thursday on the opening day of the
Nissan Open, Lancaster shooting a 5-under par 66 at the Riviera
Country Club to be one of four left two shots back of leader J.P.
Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster started on the back nine, and by the 12th hole had
four-putted. Instead of panicking, he relaxed and decided to quit
fighting his new mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to make it feel more uncomfortable, which sounds
strange, but it got better,'' Lancaster said. ``The more
uncomfortable it felt, the better it got.''
</P>
<P>
   Just think, if it really starts to feel atrocious, Lancaster
could win this tournament and become the early surprise of the PGA
Tour.
</P>
<P>
   It's not unusual for a little-known golfer to compete in an
early round of a tournament, only to fade into near oblivion by the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But Lancaster figures he's put in his time, and it hasn't all
been of the pleasant variety. This is his 11th year on the tour,
and three times he's had to go the qualifying school route,
including before this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been at the bottom a long time,'' he said. ``It sure
would be nice to get to the top one time.''
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster has won one event, the Byron Classic in 1994, and that
came when the final day of the tournament was rained out.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he always had something of an unorthodox golfing background.
He was self-taught, rising to club pro at the Johnston Country Club
in remote Smithfield, N.C., largely because he was better than
everyone. It was just assumed he knew the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually learned by looking at pictures in `Golf Digest' and
golf magazines,'' Lancaster said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never taken any serious lessons in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, anyway. Now he's taken on a golf coach, Dennis
Sheey, who has altered his swing to the point where it feels
foreign every time he starts his backswing.
</P>
<P>
   Sheey determined Lancaster was holding his hands too low as he
addressed the ball, forcing him to push out as he began to move his
club and leaving him with something of an inside-out swing. Now he
thinks he's got it right, no matter how unnatural it seems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam Snead always said, `If it feels bad, that's good,'''
Lancaster said. ``He knew a little about the game. It's so much of
a game of opposites.''
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster, 37, must have been feeling pretty bad on Thursday. He
finished the 71-par course with seven birdies, and the one
double-bogey on 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first putt was down green a bit and I just hit it way too
hard and knocked by about eight feet,'' he said. ``Then I ran it by
about a foot and a half, and just walked around to tap it in and
knocked it four feet behind and made that for a four-putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall I played pretty well. I fell asleep a couple of times.
Of course, it was 7:30 in the morning, it's tough to wake.''
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster said the key for a guy who largely learned how to play
on the course, is simple repetition. Now he just wants to repeat
that uncomfortable swing enough so that by the tournament's final
day, he can threaten for the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to be in that position Sunday,'' he said. ``You want
to be scared Sunday. You want to have a little fear Sunday when you
tee off. You want that pressure.''
</P>

ARIZONA STATE ROUTS UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Fixing glitches in type) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ NIT, or no NIT?
</P>
<P>
   After a heartless performance in a game they desperately needed,
the UCLA Bruins are face-to-disgrace with the reality they hoped to
avoid: missing the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a stunning (but not impossible) turnaround, the Bruins
have three weeks to decide if they'll accept an NIT bid.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the NIT might not want them after Thursday's
embarrassing 104-75 loss at Arizona State before 10,036 at Wells
Fargo Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils led by 13 points early, 19 midway through the
first half and 23 midway through the second in defeating UCLA for
the first time in 23 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to take everybody's best punch,'' Bruins guard
Rico Hines said. ``They are going to come at us like, `UCLA's down
this year, so let's go at them.' Especially when you beat a team 22
straight times.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a hungry cat, and we just sat down. We just gave
up.''
</P>
<P>
   It was UCLA's worst loss ever to Arizona State, but not its
worst loss ever. In coach Steve Lavin's three-plus seasons, the
Bruins have lost to Stanford by 48 points, North Carolina by 41 and
Duke by 36.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost like this before,'' guard Earl Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, ASU isn't Duke or North Carolina. The Sun Devils
have one player, guard Eddie House, who could start for UCLA. They
have an average frontline, a freshman point guard and no McDonald's
All-Americans. (UCLA has three.)
</P>
<P>
   And yet the Bruins were outcoached, outhustled, outrebounded and
outplayed _ especially by House, whose 40 points are the most
against UCLA since Wyoming's Fennis Dembo scored 41 in the 1987
NCAA Tournament. Afterward, House, a senior, rejoiced in his first
victory over the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to answer that anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the Bruins went six possessions (four turnovers,
two air balls) without hitting the rim. They were leaderless, they
were directionless, they were careless (24 turnovers) and they were
clueless. Alicia Silverstone would have been proud. Then again....
</P>
<P>
   ``They thoroughly dominated us,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin said.
``Obviously, they were on their A game. I'm disappointed we didn't
bring our A-level game ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, they're headed for an F _ as in, failure to make the NCAA
Tournament. The last time that happened, 1988, they fired coach
Walt Hazzard.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, at 13-10 overall _ yes, 13-10 _ and 4-7 in Pac-10
play, the Bruins are harrowingly close to their first losing record
in conference play since 1948.
</P>
<P>
   They have little time to regroup, what with Saturday's game at
No. 4 Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to show some maturity and flush this loss,'' Hines
said. ``There's no need to sulk, but we have to do some
soul-searching.''
</P>
<P>
   It was apparent from the start that House would not repeat his
5-of-17 shooting performance in last month's loss in Pauley
Pavilion. Hescored 16 points in the first eight minutes against
UCLA's man-to-shadow defense. His 3-pointer from the right wing
with 12 midway through the first half gave the Sun Devils a 25-12
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was due to get 30 or 40,'' said UCLA guard Ray Young, who
played against House in high school in the Bay Area. ``I told
everybody that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kapono rallied the Bruins with back-to-back 3-pointers,
and Dan Gadzuric's short turnaround closed the deficit to 29-22
with eight minutes remaining in the half.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing three minutes, the Bruins committed four
turnovers (Gadzuric, Ryan Bailey, Gadzuric, Matt Barnes) and shot
two air balls (Young, Hines). They were as disjointed and
dysfunctional, impatient and inefficient Thursday as they were in
the disastrous second-half at Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy with the way we counterpunched,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time reserve Sean Farnham made a free throw with 4:53
left, the Sun Devils had scored 12 consecutive points and extended
their seven-point lead to 19.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were no better after halftime. They continued to take
dumb shots and make stupid passes and play half-hearted defense. It
was so bad that Watson fouled out with 14 minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   A few possessions later, Hines was slapped with a technical foul
for bumping House out of bounds. Although excessive, it was UCLA's
first display of spirit of the game. They trailed by 20 at the
time.

 &HT;    McCain at zero hour
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Traveling with a candidate often is the worst
place in the world to try to get perspective on him. Reporters are
taught to be wary of crowds, to take with a grain of salt the
enthusiastic response of a candidate's most fervent supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But when 1,500 Clemson University students turn out to listen to
a 63-year-old man tell a bunch of corny jokes on a Wednesday night,
something is going on.
</P>
<P>
   When a couple of Democrats who oppose John McCain on virtually
every social issue take their lunch hour to cheer him on in
Greenville, something is going on.
</P>
<P>
   When more than 1,000 Atlantans wait in line for hours on a cold
Sunday afternoon to get McCain's autograph, something is going on.
</P>
<P>
   And the polls reflect what the traveling press sees on the
ground. The one-time dark horse is now running with the leader, at
least in the early states.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, advisers to McCain and George W. Bush say
their polling shows the race is a dead heat and voter turnout in
Saturday's primary will make the difference.
</P>
<P>
   McCain leads Bush 43 percent to 34 percent in Michigan, which
has a primary three days after South Carolina. The Detroit News
poll conducted last week has an error margin of 4 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, which holds its primary the same day as Michigan,
the news is even better for McCain. An Arizona Republic telephone
poll conducted Saturday through Wednesday shows McCain with 52
percent and Bush 29 percent. The poll has a margin of error of plus
or minus 3.4 percentage points. In October, the newspaper's poll
showed Bush leading McCain 40 percent to 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush still has a significant though shrinking lead in national
polls. But McCain's strategy was to concentrate on New Hampshire _
which he won convincingly _ and then on South Carolina,believing
victories in those early states would begin to undo the Bush
campaign and translate into support elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   McCain supporters point to Michigan, where McCain has campaigned
little, as evidence the strategy is working.
</P>
<P>
   And support for McCain is building outside the early-primary
states, partially fueled by something past insurgents such as Gary
Hart did not have _ the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Online, McCain has raised more than $5 million and attracted
115,000 volunteers across the country. Just since New Hampshire's
Feb. 1 primary, McCain has raised $3.5 million via the Internet,
campaign manager Rick Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   This hardly compares, however, to the massive organization and
resources of his front-running rival, and the Bush campaign can
claim momentum of its own in South Carolina since the defeat in New
Hampshire. And much of McCain's early surge is occurring in states
with open primaries such as Michigan and South Carolina, where
independents and even Democrats can help McCain in a way they won't
be able to in most states.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor still remains the favorite, and a decisive
win in South Carolina could be the beginning of the end of the
McCain surge.
</P>
<P>
   But even if it does end soon, the McCain campaign is the
strongest insurgent challenge since Hart, and the Republican
nomination struggle is locked in an intensity it has not been in
for 20 years, when Ronald Reagan challenged President Ford.
</P>
<P>
   What's drawing people to McCain? What's fueling the intensity?
</P>
<P>
   For a reading, here are reports from Cox Newspaper listening
posts across the country:
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: AURA OVER ISSUES?
</P>
<P>
   It sometimes seems the McCain campaign is a case of aura over
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Suzi Bergsman was standing in the Peachtree Battle Shopping
Center parking lot Sunday, along with more than a thousand other
people who have come to have McCain sign copies of his book ``Faith
of My Fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   She is more liberal than McCain on social issues, including
abortion. But she does not accept McCain is as opposed to abortion
rights as he says he is and his voting record indicates.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it came to his family, he said it's an individual's
choice. He said it would be a family decision,'' Bergsman recalled
McCain saying in January.
</P>
<P>
   Told that McCain supports a constitutional amendment to ban
abortion in most cases, Bergsman said, ``I'm pro-choice, but I'm
not a litmus-test voter.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Bergsman offered again why she likes McCain: ``You know
where he stands,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people who file through the book store for an
autograph and a brief word with McCain are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   John Sours, McCain's Georgia chairman, is not surprised. He has
been inundated by telephone calls since his candidate won the New
Hampshire primary. About a third of the callers are Democrats, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy has excited more Democrats than anyone since Ronald
Reagan,'' Sours said.

   One of those former Reagan Democrats currently enamored of
McCain is Wayne Merisotis, an Atlanta attorney. ``He is the
strongest candidate the Republican Party has offered since Dwight
David Eisenhower. He is a man of heroic proportions,'' Merisotis
said of McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The staunchest Democrat in the line may be Lawton Bowling, a
retired psychiatrist from Marietta who has not voted Republican in
more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this Roosevelt Democrat is supporting McCain because he does
not think the Democrats will take on McCain's favorite bogeyman,
the ``special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fact is, I don't think they'll do anything to hurt them,''
Bowling said. ``And I want them hurt.''

   OHIO: A SPECIAL TIE
</P>
<P>
   David Ford, volunteer chairman of McCain's presidential campaign
in Ohio, has a special link to the Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
   From 1967 to 1973, they were both prisoners of war in North
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``John has got 30 days' longevity on me,'' Ford said. ``And I
told him he can keep every one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford and McCain met when the peace agreements were signed and
they were released from their cells in Hanoi. McCain was
characteristically irreverent.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, we just slammed each other because we were both
Irish,'' Ford recalled. ``He calls me the shanty Irishman. I call
him the lace curtain Irishman.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford retired from the Air Force in 1984 as a lieutenant colonel.
He had never been involved in politics _ until McCain's campaign
called in November and asked him aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first comment was `I know nothing about politics.' They
said, `You know how to organize.' I can do that, absolutely,'' Ford
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since November, Ford has been working full time, without pay, to
build a network of McCain supporters throughout the state. McCain's
national co-chairman, Ohio Sen. Mike DeWine, has provided
invaluable help, Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   And recently, those efforts have picked up. Ford says he's
gotten as many as 200 e-mails a day, and in one 36-hour period he
received 87 phone calls. He estimates McCain's team now has about
1,000 volunteers, organized in Ohio's 19 congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that activity translates into votes remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   State party leaders and election officials said they have not
seen much evidence of a significant crossover effort in advance of
the March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
   Clark County Republican Party Chairman Dan Harkins said party
leaders are more focused on local races, ``but from what I'm
hearing they're pulling for Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   But longtime McCain supporter George M. McCann, a 77-year-old
retired pharmacist and World War II veteran in Springfield, said,
``I don't know anybody sending contribution checks at this point,
but the people that I talk with are just amazed at what has
happened. I think that a lot of people are having their minds
changed that probably last March would have thought that McCain was
a voice crying in the wilderness.''

   TEXAS: DESPITE LONG ODDS ...
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who won 68 percent of the vote in his 1998 bid for a
second term as Texas governor, isn't in any danger of losing the
March 14 primary in his home state. But McCain backers in the Lone
State State, like those across the country, say their candidate has
gotten a large boost from his victory in New Hampshire and the
closeness of the South Carolina race.
</P>
<P>
   ``My e-mail and my phone mail are just filled up _ it's amazing
what this is doing,'' said Hylan Lyon, an executive at Marlow
Industries, a high-tech company in Dallas. Lyon, who was a
classmate of McCain's at the Naval Academy and a pilot during the
Vietnam War, is heading the McCain effort in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Republican Party of Texas should be glad this is
happening because it's bringing people in who haven't been involved
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice-weekly meetings in Dallas that used to draw from 10 to 20
people now draw 40 to 50, according to Lyon. He traces the
increased interest to ``a basic human desire to not be cynical
about the government.''
</P>
<P>
   There are groups of McCain supporters in every major Texas city,
he said, but he couldn't say exactly how many of them there are.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Binder, a former Austin City Council member who is
organizing McCain supporters in the capital, said many of them are
former Bush backers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them don't like the tactics he's using, the way he's
changed since he left Texas,'' Binder said, referring to Bush's
attacks on McCain in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Binder said Texans supporting McCain are Republicans, Democrats
and independents who are attracted by the senator's war record and
his interest in reducing the influence of money in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain's the only one who is across-the-board trying to stop
big money from controlling the decisions in Washington,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the long odds, Binder wouldn't discount the possibility
of a McCain victory in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's got a good chance. I talk to more people who say
they're for McCain but they don't want to say it here in Bush
country,'' Binder said. ``There are a lot of people who are talking
Bush but are going to be voting for McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   If the McCain surge seems to have reached Dallas and Austin, it
is not registering in some other Texas locales.
</P>
<P>
   In Waco, M.A. Taylor, McLennan County's GOP chairman, said he
hasn't heard many people talk about the sudden jump in media
attention to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   He's not sure at this point what to believe and what not to
believe. ``I don't have any real good feel for what's happening,''
he said. ``Talking like a poker game, McCain was pretty much on his
last spade and he gambled and laid it all on the line in New
Hampshire, and it paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said he wasn't aware of any local increase in
contributions to McCain's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A Waco retiree says he can't understand why the outcome of one
state's primary should affect the way another state votes, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along I don't care how the people in South
Carolina vote, I'm gonna vote for Bush,'' Walter Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   But about 60 miles from Waco, Helen Dozier, GOP chairwoman of
Bosque County, said she believes the Republican establishment is
getting antsy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people are taking it a little bit like, `Let's
see what happens in South Carolina.' I don't think a loss there
would kill Bush, but it would certainly make his work harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Marshall, in East Texas, seem to be either
unfamiliar with McCain or in favor of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Bush person,'' said Guinlyn Nash, owner of a local
bookstore. She said she chooses not to listen to the media's claim
that McCain is a threat to Bush's nomination. ``I'm just not
swayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Antiques store owner Frank Shumaker, a registered Democrat, said
that as an ex-veteran he has respect for McCain as a prisoner of
war, but the negative campaigning has turned him off.
</P>
<P>
   And he said Democrats and independents registering as
Republicans to try to secure the nomination for McCain isn't fair.
``It seems to me to go against the whole theory of politics,''
Shumaker said.
</P>
<P>
   Will Hagle, a senior at East Texas Baptist University and a
native of Hallsville, said he doesn't like McCain, ``mainly because
he's running against Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   He often watches the candidate debates, along with his roommate
and college friends, and at this point he's not too worried about
McCain's victory in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think New Hampshire's messed up anyway,'' he said.

   Washington: The `real fear'
</P>
<P>
   Ed Henry, a co-editor of Roll Call, a Washington newspaper that
covers Capitol Hill, was holding court in one corner of the
bleached wood bar at the swanky George Hotel, playing the McCain
``what-if'' game, a favorite pastime in a company town where
politics often takes on the manner of a parlor game.
</P>
<P>
   Only this time the ``what-if'' question was not whether George
W. Bush would choose John McCain as a vice presidential running
mate, but whether McCain would choose Bush as his.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if it flips and even though they hate each other, Bush
has to accept the VP nod for the party?'' asked Henry of the
Washington politicos gathered to celebrate the launch a new
political Web site. After all, LBJ and Kennedy hated each other, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Or what if McCain has to select a governor because 44 of the 55
Republicans in the Senate have snubbed him in favor of Bush?
</P>
<P>
   You get the picture. The buzz is high on McCain, mainly because
reporters admire him for standing up to the Republican leadership
on issues such as tobacco and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's real fear, real fear that the Republican
machine is going to beat him,'' said Arianna Huffington, a
Republican columnist and commentator. ``Their determination to beat
him is the final proof that our system is really broken. McCain is
about removing the corruption and that is why the people love him
and the senators don't.''
</P>
<P>
   John Sununu, a former governor of New Hampshire who is backing
Bush, seemed less concerned about McCain's prospects for the Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Republicans are saying it's a shame that he's not
espousing Republican principles,'' Sununu said.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get Sununu wrong. By his book, McCain runs a good
campaign, having captured the primary in the state Sununu once
governed. But as Sununu sees it, McCain simply rewrote the play
book of ``See me, touch me, feel me'' politicking, which was
drafted by others.
</P>
<P>
   What about McCain's chances?
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's volatile vote market, anyone can beat anyone
else,'' Sununu said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate and House aides mingling at the get-together said the
word is out on the Hill to let the media know about McCain's famous
temper and reasons why he shouldn't be president. In other words,
spin as many anti-McCain tales as they can. All anonymously, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a genuine hatred on the Republican side of McCain,''
said Tony Blankley, Newt Gingrich's former press secretary. ``Among
the reasons why they don't like him is the media likes him. And
that goes to the old saying: The friend of my enemy is my enemy.''

   COLORADO: A MORAL DILEMMA
</P>
<P>
   McCain poses a moral dilemma for Pete Hautzinger, a deputy chief
district attorney and chairman of the Mesa County Democratic Party
in Western Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Hautzinger hopes the Arizona senator loses the
presidential primary because he thinks Bush is more beatable in the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   But, like unaffiliated voters and even some Democrats across the
county, Hautzinger is intrigued by McCain's upstart campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of me would like them to nominate someone who I think
would be a pretty darn good president, and that's what McCain's
starting to look like to me,'' Hautzinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Mesa County residents haven't quite decided which
Republican they will support in Colorado's March 10 primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure respect (McCain) but I'm not sure if I'd vote for
him,'' said John Pritchard, a Steve Forbes supporter who has also
contributed money to McCain and Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,200 volunteers are working for McCain in Colorado,
said Barbara Masonheimer, state coordinator for the McCain
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're saying that they don't like that Bush was anointed,''
she said. ``They don't like being told what to do.''

 &HT;    GEORGIA MOVES TO END JOB-LOSS HEARINGS FOR TEACHERS
 &HT;    650&AMP;adds. With TEACHER-DATA. For release Sunday, Feb. 20.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Georgia is on the verge of becoming the only state
in which experienced teachers cannot demand a hearing if their
school district does not want to rehire them for the next school
year.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes, who maintains that the hearing requirement
contributes to ``unconditional job protection'' for bad teachers,
asked the Georgia legislature to ``abolish tenure'' by denying
those protections for all teachers whose first teaching job in
Georgia begins after July 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Tenure consists of procedural protections against unjust
dismissal, according to the Education Commission of the States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been conversation about this approach in several
states,'' said Martha McCarthy, an Indiana University professor who
has written extensively on public school laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``But most states won't bite the bullet,'' she said. ``The
lobbying effort against it by teachers is often strong and
legislators decide (tenure) isn't costly, so they give in.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout their career, Georgia's future teachers would be
entitled to a written explanation of why they weren't offered a new
contract for the next year. But the reasons wouldn't have to come
from the state legal code's list of ``good and sufficient'' causes
for dismissal, and the teachers would have no right to challenge
the findings at a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   A bill containing the anti-tenure provision was approved this
month by the House and is receiving sympathetic consideration in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very strong bill,'' said Kathy Christie of Denver,
director of the information clearinghouse at the Education
Commission of the States. ``It will be interesting to see how far
it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   The clearinghouse's records show that all 50 states still grant
veteran teachers the right to at least one hearing at some point in
the process through which districts decide to stop employing them.
</P>
<P>
   She said proposals as strong as the governor's arose _ but sank
swiftly _ in Florida and a handful of other states.
</P>
<P>
   Govs. Don Siegelman of Alabama and Bill Owens of Colorado also
proposed this year to ``abolish tenure'' in all their public
schools. Interestingly, Colorado had already gotten credit for
abolishing tenure under former Gov. Roy Romer.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Barnes, all the other governors wanted to modify,
rather than eliminate, tenure. They worked to shorten and simplify
the appeals process and in some cases added new grounds for letting
a teacher go.
</P>
<P>
   That was also true in New York City, where Mayor Rudy Giuliani
is claiming that he ``abolished tenure'' for principals in a recent
collective bargaining agreement, and will abolish it in the next
contract with the city's teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor's running for the Senate and he needed a sound
bite,'' scoffed attorney Barry Peek, the chief negotiator for the
principals. ``The big difference is that an appeals system that
required three arbitrators and years now will take only 60 to 90
days and one arbitrator.''
</P>
<P>
   Future teachers in Georgia won't be any worse off than the
employees hit by layoffs recently announced by the Coca-Cola Co.,
said Ron Newcomb, education adviser to Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably some of them telling themselves, 'It was
me, instead of the guy next to me, because the manager didn't like
me,' but that's it. There's nothing they can do about it,'' Newcomb
said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor opposes hearings because he believes bad teachers
are protected by tenure and a hearing ``is tenure,'' Newcomb
explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's due process in the sense that, you end up litigating
both the reason for non-renewal and certain procedural
requirements,'' he continued. ``That's cumbersome. How do you
document incompetence?''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Only 19 states still use the term ``tenure'' in their legal
codes, according to the clearinghouse. But the others still require
what the clearinghouse describes as the three essentials of a
tenure process: notice, specific causes for action and due process.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Oregon, cited by Barnes as a state where schools
improved after it ``abolished tenure'' in 1997, has adopted
Barnes's approach. He apparently relied on inaccurate information
from the National Governors Association.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon never abolished tenure, according to Mark Toledo, an
attorney for the Oregon branch of the National Education
Association, and Ron Wilson, director of human resource development
for the Oregon School Boards Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Substantively, a district still has to prove one of the stated
grounds (under state law) either to dismiss a teacher during the
year or to non-renew their contract,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oregon merely changed the name of 'permanent' teachers to
'contract' teachers, and created a two-year rolling contract for
teachers and a three-year rolling contract for administrators,''
Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   When an Oregon educator's contract has one year to go, it is
either extended for another two-year or three-year period, or the
educator is given one year to reach goals spelled out in her ``plan
of action for improvement,'' which can also require extra training
and counseling by her peers.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's association surveyed 122 Oregon school boards that
employ 25,000 teachers and 1,700 administrators. They reported that
in the 1998-99 school year, 117 educators had improved enough from
the previous year to have their contracts renewed, while 38
teachers and 23 administrators were denied contract extensions.
Another 122 were ``counseled out'' (convinced to resign).
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   Similar peer review, assistance and counseling programs are
``successful'' in Toledo, Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio; Rochester,
N.Y., and Seattle, according to the National Commission on Teaching
and America's Future, a bipartisan 26-member panel headed by Gov.
Jim Hunt of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the panel reported, ``Although many claim that it is
impossible to truly evaluate teachers or get rid of those who are
incompetent, a growing number of districts are transforming old,
nonfunctional systems of teacher evaluation into peer review
systems that improve teaching performance and counsel those who
should not be in the profession.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Georgia law says there are only eight reasons a school district
can fire, suspend or deny contract renewal to its veteran teachers.
Gov. Roy Barnes proposes that those restrictions continue to apply
to all dismissals or suspensions, but not to a district's decision
to deny renewal of the annual contract of any teacher who starts
teaching in Georgia after July 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   LEGAL GROUNDS FOR SUSPENDING OR FIRING A TEACHER IN GEORGIA
</P>
<P>
   1. Incompetency
</P>
<P>
   2. Insubordination
</P>
<P>
   3. Willful neglect of duties
</P>
<P>
   4. Immorality
</P>
<P>
   5. Inciting, encouraging, or counseling students to violate any
valid state law, municipal ordinance, or policy or rule of the
local board of education
</P>
<P>
   6. To reduce staff due to loss of students or cancellation of
programs
</P>
<P>
   7. Failure to secure and maintain necessary educational training
</P>
<P>
   8. Any other good and sufficient cause
</P>
<P>
   Note: But not for ``refusal to alter a grade or grade report if
the request to alter a grade or grade report was made without good
and sufficient cause.''

<P>
   JOB PROTECTIONS FOR TEACHERS
</P>
<P>
   All 50 states offer little or no job protection to newly hired
teachers, typically for the first three years, though the
probationary periods range from two to five years.
</P>
<P>
   All 50 states limit the reasons for which an experienced teacher
can lose the right to be employed.
</P>
<P>
   All 50 states set deadlines, usually in April, for notifying
teachers that their expiring contract won't be renewed, and
specifying the reasons.
</P>
<P>
   All 50 states either require a hearing or give a veteran teacher
who receives a non-renewal notice the right to demand a hearing
usually conducted by a school board, special tribunal, hearing
officer or arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 38 states allow teachers to appeal adverse decisions only
to the courts.
</P>
<P>
   31 states use other terms, such as ``continuing contract
status'' or ``fair dismissal laws'' to describe such protections.
</P>
<P>
   19 states use the term ``tenure'' to describe legal protections
against unjustified dismissals.
</P>
<P>
   At least 12 states allow a teacher to appeal an adverse decision
administratively to a state or local board or official, and then to
the courts.

weekly science-fiction column with color and black-and-white art.)
 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Renee
O'Connor in a scene from ``Xena: Warrior Princess.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    And baby Eve makes three ... or six.
 &HT;    ``There are babies everywhere,'' says ``Xena: Warrior Princess''
co-star Renee O'Connor, referring to the impact of Eve, newborn
daughter of Xena (Lucy Lawless), who arrived a few weeks back as an
immaculate conception in the episode ``God Fearing Child.'' ``We've
had about four different babies playing this one character.
 &HT;    ``It's really amazing,'' she adds. ``I don't think that I will
ever need to have children of my own, because they are around me
all the time.''
 &HT;    Speaking by telephone from her New Zealand home on a rare day
off from the syndicated hit, O'Connor cracks up.
 &HT;    ``The great thing,'' she says, ``is that you get to give them
back at the end of the day.''
 &HT;    The advent of Eve came in the wake of Lawless' real-life
pregnancy, which culminated on Oct. 16, 1999, with the birth of
Julius Robert Bay Tapert. The baby's father is her husband,
``Xena'' creator/executive producer Rob Tapert.
 &HT;    Of course, the ramifications of Lawless' maternal joy were felt
well before the actual onscreen and offscreen deliveries. To
accommodate Lawless during her pregnancy, O'Connor handled more of
the fighting and action sequences than usual. Post-Julius, as
Lawless took some time off to recover and be with her family,
several well-received episodes focused almost exclusively on
Gabrielle (O'Connor), Xena's faithful sidekick.
 &HT;    ``I just latched onto anything I could get and really bit my
teeth into it all,'' O'Connor says. ``It's obviously been the most
I've worked in the entire run of the show, but it's been a great
opportunity for me, both physically and as an actress.
 &HT;    ``Gabrielle has been fighting for three, in a sense, just out of
sheer obsessiveness, to protect us all,'' the actress adds. ``Now
that we are going back to being more of a Xena-driven show again, I
have been fulfilling my own desires by doing theater scenes and
anything else I can outside of work, at the end of a 14-hour day on
the show.
 &HT;    ``If the energy is there, I think, you are always willing to do
whatever you can, just to grow as a performer and to have a good
time,'' she says. ``That's what I'm looking for _ I always want to
have fun.''
 &HT;    O'Connor promises plenty more fun in the latter part of
``Xena's'' fifth season. Much of it will involve Eve, whose recent
arrival threatens to herald the twilight of the gods _ in other
words, she may cause Zeus, Hades and Ares to lose their power over
mankind.
 &HT;    ``We are going to have all sorts of twists and turns,'' O'Connor
promises. ``And I'm sure that we'll have this huge finale in which
we try to kill off all of the gods.
 &HT;    ``Next season will actually be the one that I am most curious
about,'' she adds, ``in terms of what direction we'll go in and
what new enemies the writers will create to continue the show.
We've always had plenty of angry gods to deal with, but next year
should be a very interesting challenge for everybody.''
 &HT;    O'Connor figures that ``Xena'' will be around for another year
or two, and she's definitely up for it. After all, there are still
butts aplenty to kick, character traits to explore, episodes to
direct and stranger-than-strange experiences to savor.
 &HT;    ``Every day on `Xena' is strange,'' says O'Connor, who spent an
ungodly portion of last week's stand-alone comic episode, ``Married
with Fishsticks,'' portraying Crustacea, a mermaid with three fishy
kids. ``There is always something that makes me sit back and laugh,
because I just can't believe I'm doing it.
 &HT;    ``Yesterday, for instance, I was sitting at the back of a cart
that they had attached to a truck,'' she recalls. ``We were getting
ready for the shot, and the director was yelling, ` ... And a
gigantic plasma fireball is coming at you from the left!'
 &HT;    ``You've just got to laugh,'' she concludes. ``I have to think,
`This is my job.' Every day there is something just like that, and
I love it.''

   Plaids and polka dots come together to make a nice quilt
</P>
<P>
   By Phil Latham
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   A fellow called me Saturday, not identifying himself by name,
but by race. I would pass that information along to you but it
really doesn't matter. It almost never matters.
</P>
<P>
   If it helps you envision the story in your mind, make him
polka-dotted.
</P>
<P>
   He had done a good deed that day, found some property dropped in
the parking lot outside a Marshall shopping establishment. I would
tell you which one but it really doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   This fellow is the sort of guy who enjoys doing a good deed,
just like most of us. So when he found this checkbook, with deposit
slip inside, he wanted to personally find the person who lost it.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure he anticipating seeing that wonderful look people get
on their face when you have done them a kindness, especially an
unexpected one.
</P>
<P>
   So he entered the store and, after looking around a bit,
eventually came upon three employees who of a different race. Which
race really doesn't matter, but if it helps you envision the story,
think of them as plaid.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately in our city and country, plaid and polka-dotted
people don't always get along, but this fellow doesn't have any
such personal problems. He went to the plaid employees and asked
them to help him find the rightful owner of the checkbook.
</P>
<P>
   He was not given a warm welcome, or much of a welcome at all.
The plaid employees took the checkbook and dismissed him summarily,
so cold that he felt himself nothing more than a third-class
polka-dotted citizen. Maybe they just didn't like polka dots.
</P>
<P>
   But Mr. Polka-dot decided that he wasn't going to take that kind
of treatment and he demanded the checkbook back. He didn't much
trust these plaid people and it was clear that they did not trust
him. They didn't want to give it back, though they finally did.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, another plaid person arrived and announced, somewhat
suspiciously it seemed to Mr. Polka-dot, that the checkbook was
hers. Mr. Polka-dot did not believe her. Before he would let the
matter drop he verified her driver's license number. He eventually
was satisfied that the plaid person and the owner of the checkbook
were one and the same.
</P>
<P>
   But did the plaid owner ever once thank him for finding her
checkbook? Nope. Not even a hint of gratitude was in her voice or
on her plaid face. The guess here is that she had had some bad
experiences with polka-dot people in her lifetime that led her not
to want to be anywhere around them.
</P>
<P>
   She probably wouldn't have wanted her family around polka-dots,
either. Perhaps she would have been concerned that some of the dots
would rub off.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Polka-dot would like to think that all plaid people aren't
like that individual, but the total lack of trust makes him wonder.
The next time he has to deal with a plaid person, he'll almost
certainly be more cautious, more withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Now if you've spent the entire time reading this column trying
to decide the real race of Mr. Polka-dot or the three plaid ladies,
then you need to realize that you are part of the problem. As I
said in the beginning, the exact races really don't matter and
those who are guessing are probably dead wrong.
</P>
<P>
   What really matters is, who won and who lost? Plaid or
Polka-dot? I shouldn't have to tell you the answer, but here's a
hint: There weren't any winners.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   P.S.: To the person or persons who persist in sending racist
literature to my office and home, please note that I have decided
to donate $10 to Wiley College through the United Negro College
Fund for each letter I get. Keep it up and we'll get together a
nice scholarship.

   I'll buy you a diamond ring my friend, if it makes you feel all

</P>
<P>
   I'll get you anything my friend, if it makes you feel all right.
</P>
<P>
   'Cause I don't care too much for money, money can't buy me love.
</P>
<P>
   The lyrics by the Beatles struck a chord with idealistic young
people in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   That was the same year that Bob Dylan released his hit tune
``The Times They Are A-Changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the times they are a-changing backward.
</P>
<P>
   People today act as though money can buy love.
</P>
<P>
   Either that, or money counts and love is irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial television's latest follow-the-money hit was the Fox
special ``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   This show comes on the heels of popular television programs such
as ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' and ``Greed.''
</P>
<P>
   More grab-the-bucks television shows, such a CBS' ``Survivor,''
are in the works.
</P>
<P>
   These shows follow a prolonged nationwide gambling craze that
has prompted state after state to adopt government-backed lotteries
and scratch-off games.
</P>
<P>
   These ``games'' appeal to the public's growing get-rich-quick
fantasies. For most of America's history the ``numbers rackets''
were run by organized crime bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Gift of love
</P>
<P>
   It's not just entertainment going for the gold.
</P>
<P>
   Out in California, where cultural trends begin, a service
reportedly founded by Christian women, known as Families2000,
placed an ad in the Stanford Daily student newspaper that read:
``Give the Gift of Love and Life. Very Special Egg Donor Needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad offers young college women the opportunity to compete for
the opportunity to sell their eggs for $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The buyer of these eggs is said to be an infertile couple.
</P>
<P>
   The buyer wants eggs from a woman under 30, Caucasian and
athletic. ``Proven college level athletic ability preferred.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the San Jose Mercury News, this is a new high
asking price for human eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, young women at several prestigious universities were
offered $50,000 for their ``gift of love.'' In that case, the buyer
was looking for a seller who was tall, athletic and a top student
with high SAT scores.
</P>
<P>
   I'll give you all I got to give, if you say you love me too.
</P>
<P>
   I may not have a lot to give, but what I got I'll give to you.
</P>
<P>
   I don't care too much for money, money can't buy me love.
</P>
<P>
   The ratings on ``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?''
indicate more big-bucks bachelors will parade bevies of beauties
into homes across America.
</P>
<P>
   The bachelor gets to select a prime babe without going through
the time-consuming and expensive dating business. He doesn't have
to say ``I love you'' or risk getting turned down.
</P>
<P>
   The guy gets to ask the gals a bunch of questions. The gals
don't ask questions. They only speak when spoken to.
</P>
<P>
   The gals, however, get to marry a really rich guy.
</P>
<P>
   Come gather round people
</P>
<P>
   Wherever you roam
</P>
<P>
   And admit that the waters
</P>
<P>
   Around you have grown
</P>
<P>
   And accept it that soon
</P>
<P>
   You'll be drenched to the bone
</P>
<P>
   If your time to you
</P>
<P>
   Is worth savin'
</P>
<P>
   Then you better start swimmin'
</P>
<P>
   Or you'll sink like a stone
</P>
<P>
   For the times they are a-changing.

 &HT;    Heart Month aims to strengthen `chain of survival'
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ In about half the deaths from coronary artery
disease in this country, the heart just suddenly stops. There are
no warnings of chest pain, racing heartbeats or labored breaths.
There's no time for hustling to the hospital in the family car. The
first symptoms are a loss of consciousness, pulse and breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 5 percent of the people whose hearts stop suddenly
survive, and many of them are brain-damaged. Sudden cardiac arrest
kills 250,000 Americans a year.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't have to be that deadly, says the American Heart
Association. Most cases of sudden cardiac arrest are reversible,
but only with sudden medical treatment. Survival rates range from
barely 1 percent in New York City's jungle of traffic congestion
and high-rises to nearly 50 percent in the Mayo Clinic's home city
of Rochester, Minn., where a high percentage of people know
cardiopulmonary resuscitation, ambulances usually respond quickly
to 911 calls and all the police cars carry automated external
defibrillators.
</P>
<P>
   So the heart association's campaign for Heart Month in February
is to enhance the steps that save lives after cardiac arrest, from
quick recognition of symptoms and 911 calls to increased knowledge
of CPR to expanded access to AEDs to improved drugs and machines in
ambulances and hospital emergency rooms. The ``chain of survival''
is what the AHA calls it.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is understanding the difference between cardiac
arrest and the myocardial infarctions that are typically called
heart attack. A heart attack is caused by diminished blood flow to
the heart, which starves the heart muscle and can unfold gradually.
Sometimes it leads to cardiac arrest, but the arrest itself is an
electrical malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   More than two-thirds of cardiac arrests are caused by the fast
and chaotic heartbeat known as ventricular fibrillation. The others
result from arrhythmias, or extreme slowdowns of the heartbeat.
Either way, the heart's pump no longer can pump the blood that
brain and heart cells need to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all heart diseases can cause heart-stopping malfunctions,
as can disorders of the nervous system and electrocution or other
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   CPR alone won't bring a victim out of cardiac arrest, but it
buys more time for an emergency medical service crew to restart the
heart. Without CPR, brain damage begins after four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``With CPR, the window can be extended up to eight minutes,''
says Don Coterel, and emergency medical technician and CPR trainer
with the Beavercreek Fire Department. That's a big difference in
Beavercreek, where the average 911 response time is a relatively
quick 4.1 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It gives emergency crews ``time to get on the scene while we can
still do some good,'' Coterel says. ``There's no doubt in my mind
that CPR saves lives.''
</P>
<P>
   With someone pushing the chest wall hard enough to move the
heart's pump and (preferably someone else) breathing through the
victim's mouth to the lungs, CPR circulates at least some blood
with some oxygen in it.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to learn. CPR trainer Leanne Stidham is teaching
her daughter's second-grade Brownie troop the basic 90-minute
course later this month.
</P>
<P>
   But restarting the heart requires an automated external
defibrillator. Since Heart Association research showed in the 1960s
that electric shocks could restore a normal rhythm, these expensive
110-pound machines have shrunk to $3,000 in cost and less than 10
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations and airlines are starting to buy AEDs and train
people to use them. Ohio law shields anyone using an AED from
lawsuits as long as the person has first called 911 and is trying
to save a life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we know that AEDs are literally easy enough for a child to
use,'' University of Washington Dr. Gust H. Bardy said last year
after the Heart Association showed that sixth-graders could learn
to use AEDs with moderate training. The sixth-graders needed just
half a minute longer than trained professionals to deliver the
appropriate shock for restarting a heart, although they didn't have
the emotional complications of working on a live and dying person.
</P>
<P>
   In Rochester, police officers have saved 10 of the 14 cardiac
arrest patients on whom they administered AEDs, none of whom would
likely have survived otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, only about 30 percent of American EMS divisions have
AED programs. In the Dayton area, the Miami Valley American Heart
Association knows of AEDs in Vandalia's first-response vehicles,
the Montgomery County Sheriff's Department and the Dayton Fire
Department, besides Beavercreek's manual defibrillators on all
emergency vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The AHA hopes not only to broaden those numbers but also to make
AEDs routinely available in airports, shopping malls, sports
arenas, large corporate buildings, golf courses and other places
where it's hard for an EMS to respond within four minutes. Doing
so, the association says, could save 50,000 lives a year.
</P>
<P>
   CARDIAC ARREST SIGNS
</P>
<P>
   Cardiac arrest often has no warning signs, so the first symptoms
are life-threatening:
</P>
<P>
   _ Sudden collapse and unconsciousness.
</P>
<P>
   _ No pulse.
</P>
<P>
   _ No breathing.
</P>
<P>
   However, it can be preceded by the following symptoms that also
can signal the onset of a heart attack:
</P>
<P>
   _ Chest pain.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shortness of breath.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fatigues easily.
</P>
<P>
   _ Racing heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Light-headedness.

 &HT;    New computerized scans on cutting edge of cardiac care
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb

   KETTERING, Ohio _ Through special glasses, the picture on the
computer screen looks like a model of a heart. The distinct,
three-dimensional chambers, the thicket of arteries heading toward
the lungs, the spine in the background _ it is all very lifelike.
</P>
<P>
   To be more precise, it's alive. The image in Kettering Medical
Center's radiology department compiles advanced X-ray scans of a
person's heart, resting between beats.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can look at the heart and turn it around as if it's in
your own hands,'' said Dr. Ziwar Karabatak, a Kettering
cardiologist who saw the image last week for the first time. ``It's
something like a dream that you thought could happen one day. But
it's reality now.''
</P>
<P>
   Karabatak and the other doctors who first see this computerized
tomography image ``want to use it tomorrow,'' says Bilal Ezzeddine,
Kettering's imaging project director, who has two Ph.D.s. But
stunning as it is to see a heart jump off the screen in three
dimensions, Ezzeddine says Kettering's researchers ``aren't there
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   They plan to develop a safer, faster and cheaper way of
discovering early stages of heart disease and diagnosing the
symptoms that send people to hospitals. As Ezzeddine envisions it,
the CT technology will be an interim step. The ultimate goal is to
use a single magnetic resonance imaging device not only for
``virtual heart'' replications, but also to perform the gamut of
cardiac diagnostic tests that now require four machines.
</P>
<P>
   Working with manufacturer Siemens Medical Systems of Iselin,
N.J., Kettering is one of only five hospitals worldwide
investigating digital imagery to find out if it can assess
cardiovascular disease as reliably as an angiogram, the diagnostic
gold standard performed through a catheter to the cardiac arteries.
</P>
<P>
   The drawback to angiograms is they involve sticking a tube
through the patient's arteries and shooting dye through it. That
carries risks. But unless digital imagery can predict heart disease
as accurately as an angiogram, it won't matter how much safer it
is.
</P>
<P>
   To determine that, Kettering researchers are examining both
types of pictures of the same patients, and comparing how well they
illustrate the extent of the patients' heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Cardiologists already use high-speed CT scans to look for heart
disease in patients without symptoms. The Dayton Heart Hospital has
been doing that since it opened in September, Kettering will start
using its scanner for screening soon and Good Samaritan Hospital
has ordered a machine for the same purpose _ giving the Dayton area
one of the highest ratios of fast scanners to population in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The screening CT scans can detect heart disease in people who
feel fine, enabling them to change their diets or add medication so
it doesn't become serious.
</P>
<P>
   Kettering's research is aimed more at people whose hearts
already are causing problems. When they come to the emergency room
with chest pains, faster diagnosis makes for faster medical
treatment _ maybe drugs to dissolve a blood clot, maybe balloon
angioplasty to open a blocked cardiac artery, maybe surgery to
bypass the clogged artery. The faster the treatment, the less
damage to heart muscle, says Dave Seidel, Kettering's director of
cardiac services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're only able to do this because we have the imaging
infrastructure already in place,'' Ezzeddine says. Siemens brings
people to Kettering from all over to see its system for storing and
transmitting medical images on computer disks and a faster, lighter
MRI machine that's one of about 10 in the country.
</P>
<P>
   MRIs have traditionally been too slow to capture a heart's image
between beats, but the new unit displays the beating heart more
seamlessly than streaming video on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   After focusing its MRI energy on brains for the last few years,
Kettering is just beginning to turn its attention to the body's
other command center. ``You could argue the heart is the more
important one,'' Ezzeddine says, ``because heart disease is the
leading cause of death.''
</P>
<P>
   Where CT scans can display the geographic layout of an organ, an
MRI also can depict the chemical activity within that geography.
High activity of certain chemicals in the brain indicates a tumor.
Low activity of other chemicals in the heart indicates dead muscle.
</P>
<P>
   The MRI uses colors to show how much of a chemical is present,
so it can illustrate a diseased heart with the rainbow spectrum
from robust red areas to dead violet areas. It's comparable to a
color-coded U.S. map that shows high concentrations of population
on the East Coast and low ones in Wyoming and Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have other ways of showing a muscle's viability, but this
way we can see it earlier,'' says Mehdi Adineh, Kettering's
Ph.D.-level senior MRI physicist. And only the MRI can show the
geography of a cardiac artery blockage and the inactivity of dead
heart muscle on the same image.
</P>
<P>
   They're a relevant package, says Seidel, because hospitals waste
millions of dollars uselessly rerouting blood vessels to nourish
heart tissue that is already dead.
</P>
<P>
   Those millions aren't there to waste anymore. In fact, with
health plans reimbursing hospital services at ``40 to 45 cents on
the dollar,'' Seidel says there aren't enough profits to fully fund
this imaging research, being overseen by cardiologist Dr. Robert
Kiefaber and radiologist Dr. Richard McKenzie.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to seek external funding,'' Seidel says, making
Kettering's partnerships with Siemens and Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base all the more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   The next step in the MRI research is making the cardiac arteries
more visible, Ezzeddine says. When the scientists figure out how to
show them clearly on MRIs, the resulting one-station diagnoses will
be not only safer, faster and cheaper, but also less confusing,
with all relevant information on a single image.
</P>
<P>
   Ezzeddine is eager to see how the heart doctors apply all this
information. He knows they won't close down the catheterization
labs just because diagnostic angiograms become obsolete. Caths will
still be needed for balloon angioplasty, for example, in which
tubing is run through the arteries to open up a narrowing heart
vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians have so many intricate, new ways of navigating blood
vessels to repair cardiovascular disease that it is spawning a new
specialty, cardiac intervention, in which Karabatak is
board-certified. They snake their instruments through the vessels
and fix them from the inside without surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Without cutting the patient open, though, the doctor can't see
what he or she is doing. The angiograms and other two-dimensional
images don't show exactly how the blood vessels are twisted or
bent. So Karabatak says he tries to visualize what a stack of
two-dimensional CT scans would look like in three dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the computer does that for me,'' he says of the image that
so excited him last week. ``You can see and anticipate possible
complications before you get to them. It takes away a lot of
guessing.''

 &HT;    Estrogen therapy cited as preventing heart disease
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The benefits of estrogen replacement therapy
(ERT) in preventing heart disease generally outweigh the increased
breast cancer risk, says a cancer journal article that is the
second major research report in a month to associate increases in
breast cancer with post-menopausal ERT.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have calculated that, for each (new) case of breast cancer
in women due to long-term ERT use, more than six deaths from heart
disease are prevented,'' the University of Southern California
researchers wrote in this Wednesday's issue of the Journal of the
National Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The report gives the most tangible risk-benefit analysis so far
of estrogen's role in raising breast cancer rates and lowering
heart disease rates, but the authors called for more research of
women with family histories of breast disease. ERT relieves
symptoms caused by menopause.
</P>
<P>
   The USC researchers agreed with the Journal of the American
Medical Association report last month that the breast cancer rate
rises even more when estrogen is combined with progestin in order
to lower the risk of uterine cancer. They said taking the hormones
on alternate days is slightly riskier than taking both every day.
</P>
<P>
   While JAMA placed the risk increases for breast cancer at 20
percent with estrogen alone and 40 percent with both hormones, the
JNCI report placed the percentage increases at 6 and 24,
respectively, after five years of hormone therapy. The JNCI report
said a woman's risk for breast cancer increases by 6 percent for
every five years she takes supplemental estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Women should consider their family histories and ``also be told
where uncertainty still exists in the risk-benefit equation,''
wrote the USC researchers, who studied more than 3,500 women.

   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ LUFKIN, Texas _ If I were an African-American

<P>
   EDITORIAL-WACO _ WACO, Texas _ If it wasn't a whitewash, it's a

compound, April 19, 1993. (Waco Tribune-Herald). FOR SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ The push for the U.S. government to pay off
slaves' descendants is building again. But that's simply too big a
can of worms for the nation to dare open. But the untenability of
the idea does not mean that it isn't a useful lens through which to

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ While the president is well-intending when he
seeks to release some of the U.S. emergency fuel supply and to
financially assist people in parts of the country where the price
of heating oil has ascended beyond all reason, he is not addressing
the issue. That issue is U.S. dependence on foreign oil. (Howard

   GLASS-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ A half-century-ago, David Riesman, a

shifted from lives guided by internal gyroscopes to ones steered by
the currents of peer pressure and the mass media. The other day,
Norman Nie, a Stanford political scientist, released a study that
found the Internet fostered social isolation among Americans,
auguring an online society drained of genuine human relationships
and meaningful emotions. Some reports viewed his findings as a
cyberage update of ``The Lonely Crowd.'' (Andy Glass is a columnist

   You have to have a prism to penetrate the stock market. The goal
at my hedge fund is to look through a prism that excludes the most
dangerous stocks, includes the most promising stocks and allows you
enough liquidity to be able to move quickly if need be.
</P>
<P>
   The amazing thing about our prism is it has changed completely
in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   First, let's talk about the old prism. We cared chiefly about
how a stock was positioned relative to the mean. We were looking
for stocks that might sell at a cheaper multiple to earnings than
the market but that grew faster than the market.
</P>
<P>
   Or we were looking for stocks, chiefly financials, but also
cyclicals, that sold at absurdly low levels to true book value,
betting that the value would be brought out through either stock
repurchases or acquisitions by other companies.
</P>
<P>
   To find these stocks, we would look through screens, read annual
reports and watch insider-buying patterns. Often we would come
across them by going to conferences, but just as often we would
come across them by talking to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Once we were in the stocks, we cared passionately about whether
they would meet the expectations of the Street on the bottom line,
the so-called whisper number. If they didn't, we would freak out
like everyone else, but because we fundamentally believed in the
company, we might stick around and buy more when others were
panicking because we would understand the screw-up and conceivably
value it as an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The new prism is entirely different. When we say the
``fundamentals'' in the new prism, we are not talking about
earnings per share or whisper numbers. We are looking at revenue
growth and orders.
</P>
<P>
   When Hewlett-Packard's number recently came out, we didn't care
nearly as much about the bottom line as about the top line and the
orders.
</P>
<P>
   We want to see growth. We no longer care whether the earnings
per share is above or below the mean of the market. We don't care
because when we do, we end up missing all of the best stocks.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is bio versus pharma. The old prism works
perfectly for the big pharmaceuticals, but they generate no capital
gains anymore (in case you haven't noticed).
</P>
<P>
   But try using the old prism on biotech and you strike out
entirely. We haven't yet been able to adopt our current prism to
biotech, because revenue growth isn't as important as trials. These
stocks seem to us to be selling on potential size of market per
drug vs. established companies' market capitalizations.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things I am trying to divine out of our biotech
rotisserie league is an apples-to-apples way to compare these
companies, which is another way of saying, I am looking for a prism
that works to identify winners.
</P>
<P>
   (We did not use stocks under $500 million in market cap because
we feared the Hymowitz effect, where we would move the stocks to
nobody's good, including our own.)
</P>
<P>
   Understand that for tech, our prism now includes a couple of
items that we simply could not have cared less about in the old
days:
</P>
<P>
   _We care about lockup expirations because when eToys' lockup
expired, the stock went from 58 to 14, and we can't have that
happen to us.
</P>
<P>
   _We care about secondaries because sometimes the secondaries
mark a level of distribution that a stock can't handle. Case in
point: The secondary in Scient has made that stock so heavy that it
doesn't have the snap we need to get back in.
</P>
<P>
   _We care about _ oh mercy _ the chart, because many of the big
funds now care about the charts. They probably always cared, but
now that the pure fundamentalists are retiring, they are more out
of the closet about it.
</P>
<P>
   Is one prism more or less rigorous than the other? I don't think
so. I used to. I always felt that we had replaced science with
alchemy when we shifted prisms. I loved the lovey blanket of the
P/E and the sanctity of book value.
</P>
<P>
   But what good is a prism that consistently keeps you out of
winners and keeps you in losers?
</P>
<P>
   In the end, this business comes down to one thing: money. Can
you make it for people, or can't you? You may have a long-term
approach for your money, but the people whose money you run just
don't. They will take it from you if your prism produces low or
abysmal returns. And they will give it to the guy with the better
prism.
</P>
<P>
   Is that fair? Is that just? Is that kind? Nah, it's just
business.

   WARNER-ON-WOOD _ ATLANTA _ The first jig one must make upon
acquiring a table saw is a push stick. The saw probably came with a
flimsy plastic one. Throw it away, after noting its design. The

   DIET-HEALTH _ About one-third of normal dieters progress to
pathological dieting that jeopardizes their health, according to
Eating Disorders Awareness and Prevention, which is sponsoring an

about 1 million men, those diets turn into diagnosable eating

   HEART-MONTH _ In about half the deaths from coronary artery

deadly, says the American Heart Association. (Dayton Daily News).

   HEART-SCAN _ Through special glasses, the picture on the

three-dimensional chambers, the thicket of arteries heading toward
the lungs, the spine in the background _ it is all very lifelike.
To be more precise, it's alive. The image in Kettering Medical
Center's radiology department compiles advanced X-ray scans of a
person's real heart, resting between beats. (Dayton Daily News).

Certain modifications, of course, would be necessary. (Murray, Cox

   EDITORIAL-WACO _ WACO, Texas _ If it wasn't a whitewash, it's a

compound, April 19, 1993. (Waco Tribune-Herald). FOR SATURDAY

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ The push for the U.S. government to pay off
slaves' descendants is building again. But that's simply too big a
can of worms for the nation to dare open. But the untenability of

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ While the president is well-intending when he
seeks to release some of the U.S. emergency fuel supply and to
financially assist people in parts of the country where the price
of heating oil has ascended beyond all reason, he is not addressing
the issue. That issue is U.S. dependence on foreign oil. (Howard

   GLASS-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ A half-century-ago, David Riesman, a
Yale sociologist, found in ``The Lonely Crowd'' that Americans had
shifted from lives guided by internal gyroscopes to ones steered by
the currents of peer pressure and the mass media. The other day,
Norman Nie, a Stanford political scientist, released a study that
found the Internet fostered social isolation among Americans,
auguring an online society drained of genuine human relationships
and meaningful emotions. Some reports viewed his findings as a
cyberage update of ``The Lonely Crowd.'' (Andy Glass is a columnist

 Comfort food and tales for the feverish   &HT;     (For release Tuesday Feb. ??)  
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Someone should make a study to see if sales of People magazine
go up during the flu season along with herb tea and ``Casablanca''
movie rentals.
</P>
<P>
   A magazine, especially one with more pictures than words, is
about as deep as you want to go in a fevered state. This is not the
time for serious thought, which is my excuse for failing to
complete the assigned January reading of ``Wild Swans'' for my book
club. My head could not keep track of three generations of a
Chinese family, as compelling as their stories were. The only thing
the book did was set up a craving for hot and sour soup which is
what I most want when my throat begins to swell and my ears buzz.
</P>
<P>
   Gayanne, when stricken, takes to her bed with all her cats,
drinks strong mint tea and nibbles on ginger cookies. At the start
of the flu she reads People, then, when the eye-burning subsides,
advances to Vanity Fair.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime she doesn't want to talk. ``I don't answer the
phone but I do screen my calls to see if anyone is feeling sorry
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   I read somewhere that Vanessa Redgrave, also under the weather,
was on ``vocal rest,'' which is something most sickies can
understand.
</P>
<P>
   Sara, normally cheerful, deigns when ill to speak only to family
members who bring tea and ``don't need me to make decisions about
moving to New Mexico or buying a sports car.''
</P>
<P>
   When Barbara's sick she wants to be read to. Her father used to
read her A.J. Liebling when she had a high fever. ``Those moments
of having the fever and him sitting next to me reading are forever
in my mind as a good time, even though I felt horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Same with Dee. ``When my mind is mush I want children's books
like ``James and the Giant Peach'' read to me.'' When stronger, she
likes something by Ursula LeGuinn, and as the headache lessens
moves to the New Yorker, ``thus feeling virtuous as well as
self-indulgent.''
</P>
<P>
   An old movie, especially one you've seen before so you don't
have to stay awake for the whole thing, can be a treat when you get
to where you can sit up and focus. Neva recommends ``A Thousand
Clowns'' or ``Mr. Darcy romping about in the BBC version of `Pride
and Prejudice.' ''
</P>
<P>
   One man I know, when bit by the bug, requires ``The African
Queen'' and that thick green nighttime cold medicine which he takes
during daytime, too, and swears by, even though it once spilled on
the night stand and ate the wood.
</P>
<P>
   Vivian endured three rounds of antibiotics this winter and
during the time remembers watching two movies, ``The Parent Trap''
and something with Jim Carrey. But it's possible she was
hallucinating.
</P>
<P>
   Penelope made it through the flu drinking only hot water and
listening to the books-on-tape version of ``The Jewel in the
Crown.''
</P>
<P>
   Those lucky enough to retain an appetite know exactly what they
want and it is usually un-exotic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cornmeal mush, cooked slow, no lumps, Grandma's recipe,'' says
Jane.
</P>
<P>
   Sara believes in bacon with English muffins, and Robin wants
chicken soup with rice, a la Maurice Sendak. Others trust in the
restorative powers of miso soup, matzo ball soup and Campbell's
cream of tomato.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually you'll begin to want something sweet to eat and
bigger to read. When you begin to wean yourself off cough medicine
and stop sleeping in a turtleneck, it will be time for ice cream
and bananas or even a bit of chocolate along with a book worthy of
your time. Perhaps ``Harry Potter.''

   HEART-DISEASE (Washington) _ While cholesterol and heart disease
are linked in the minds of many as closely as smoking and lung

   LADIES (Albany, N.Y.) _ Trend watchers are hailing the return of
the lady. The idea is at once old-fashioned and modern, a
combination of traditional manners and career savvy. These modern
ladies appear as stars on the fashion pages _ socialites talking
about their careers as doctors and the balls they attend. It is a
simple four-letter word: lady. But to some, the word conveys a
powerful and dangerous idea that women should approach with
caution. By CELINA OTTAWAY.

   BOOK-PROFILE-BOOMERS (Albany, N.Y.) _ Walter Burke and his law
partner, Timothy Casserly, are hoping they can bridge the gap many
baby boomers face when dealing with personal, financial and legal
problems. Along with two other colleagues, they have written an
impressively practical resource book titled ``Boomer Basics''
($24.95, McGraw Hill). By DOUG BLACKBURN.

<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-DIAMONDS (Undated) _ To be fair, ``Diamonds'' is not
utterly charmless. Au contraire. It has a few things going for it,
not the least of which is 83-year-old Kirk Douglas in his first
role since suffering a stroke four years ago. Douglas limps and
slurs his words, but none of that keeps him from turning in a
performance of stubborn, impish vitality. By AMY BIANCOLLI.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-BOILER (Undated) _ The arrogant, lying, obnoxious,
bigoted, misogynistic, scummy, self-satisfied, cold-hearted young
stockbrokers who mill around the insides of the newly released
``Boiler Room'' know what's important. Ferraris are important.
Tanning beds are important. Shiny ties are important. By AMY
BIANCOLLI.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-HANGING (Undated) _ Somewhere between Betty Friedan
and Helen Reddy stands Diane Keaton. The women she's played are a
staggering congress representing female independence, though her
neurotic shtick often seemed to be apologizing for trying to make
it after all. By WESLEY MORRIS.
</P>
<P>
   TV-SOPRANOS (Undated) _ Another story on ``The Sopranos`` is
like another dollar in Bill Gates' pocket. Unnecessary. Overkill.
It's almost impossible not to laugh now when HBO airs the hyperbole
of TV critics. Because, yes, the cumulative fawning effect merits
the spoofing that ``Saturday Night Live`` gave it, and it only
serves to fuel what is becoming a groundswell of disappointment
among a certain pocket of viewers. By TIM GOODMAN.

   WORKER-INITIATIVE (San Francisco) _ Consultant and author Bob
Nelson has heard all sorts of useful and unusual workplace stories,
some of which he recounts in his latest book, ``1,001 Ways to Take
Initiative at Work.'' Nelson says many employees fail to get ahead
because they do only what their bosses tell them without

   SPORTS (``S'' CATEGORY)
</P>
<P>
   BBN-ROCKER (Scottsdale, Ariz.) _ John Rocker is a lonely man
these days, distanced from his teammates and detached from the game
he disgraced. He's out of sight, but not out of mind. From Arizona
to Florida, where spring training opens this week, he remains a
subject of scorn. By JOHN SHEA.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   COPS-TRIAL (Albany, N.Y.) _ It's like running off a cliff in the
dark. Suddenly, unexpectedly, the Diallo shooting trial that has
consumed us from the moment the change of venue was announced is
abruptly done with testimony 18 days from the morning the jury pool
gathered at the Albany County Courthouse. The jury, which has had
its ears pinned back by the pace of this trial, gets a deserved
five-day weekend to mull it all over. Then on Tuesday it's back on
the freight train. By FRED LeBRUN.
</P>
<P>
   GENTRIFICATION (San Francisco) _ In the upcoming March 7 primary
election, a unique measure will push San Francisco into the
national spotlight. Proposition F, the ``Bayview Hunters Point
Reparations`` measure, would waive all home property taxes for five
years on houses valued at less than $500,000 in the neighborhood.
It would exempt small businesses from paying city payroll taxes for
five years. And it would force the mayor and the Board of
Supervisors to allocate $150 million for a fund to create jobs for
residents in the district. Sponsors say it is intended to stop
gentrification. By LEE HUBBARD.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-PRIMARY (San Francisco) _ Crossover voters won't help
either Sen. John McCain or former Sen. Bill Bradley in the March 7
California primary. That's because only party members will get to
select convention delegates. By RICHARD A. RUBIN.

THE EXPECTATIONS GAME WORKS IN MCCAIN'S FAVOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pundits have set up the expectations game very nicely for
John McCain in Saturday's South Carolina primary: If McCain wins,
McCain wins; if Bush wins, McCain wins.
</P>
<P>
   For a while there, it looked as though Gov. George W. Bush might
be able to claim victory in South Carolina just by racking up the
highest vote total. But the media didn't like that scenario because
it might have signaled the end of the McCain boomlet, which the
media created and which they are frantically trying to sustain.
</P>
<P>
   So. Since the media make the rules for the expectations game,
they can also change the rules whenever it suits their purpose to
do so. Their purpose in South Carolina is to make sure that McCain
keeps his post-New Hampshire momentum intact, and they will
accomplish this by declaring McCain the winner even if Bush gets
more votes.
</P>
<P>
   It works this way. Because Bush once held a commanding lead in
the South Carolina polls, he cannot be considered the winner simply
by winning. To have any chance at all of being declared victorious
by the media, Bush would have to bury McCain in some sort of
unprecedented landslide _ and it's fairly obvious that such a
result is remote, if not impossible.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, on the other hand, needs to do no more than give Bush a
tussle for the media to declare him successful _ and for the
pundits to proclaim that the Bush campaign is on the ropes, if not
down for the count.
</P>
<P>
   Strange, isn't it? Maybe my memory is playing tricks on me, but
I seem to recall a time when would-be presidents went from state to
state, competing for votes and delegates until one of them captured
enough votes and collected enough delegates to claim his party's
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But no more. Now the media have effectively snatched the
nominating process away from the voters by using the expectations
game to render the primaries meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bad deal for a candidate whose game plan is to march
methodically across the country, brushing off the occasional defeat
while piling up delegate counts en route to the summer convention.
But it's made to order for an insurgent candidate who wagers
everything on winning the expectations game with a few early
primary victories.
</P>
<P>
   Bad for Bush. Good for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   This process only works long-term for McCain if Republican
voters passively accept the role assigned them by the media _ the
role of rubber stamp for the media's chosen candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, one of the apparent reasons for McCain's early
success has been resistance to Bush's ``inevitability''; voters
don't want the party establishment telling them how they should
vote. Fair enough.
</P>
<P>
   But now Republican voters are in the position of having their
nominee dictated not by their own party's leaders but by the media
_ not to mention all these non-Republicans who keep jumping onto
the McCain bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   Will Republican voters acquiesce in the pundit-propelled
proposition that a McCain victory in New Hampshire and a victory or
near-victory in South Carolina sounds the death knell for the Bush
campaign? Or will they be thoughtful and conscientious enough to
insist on making their own decisions about which candidate can best
represent the Republican Party in the general election?
</P>
<P>
   I'm guessing that if Republicans don't appreciate their party
honchos telling them how to vote, they are surely more offended by
the idea that the media and members of the opposing party could
pick the GOP candidate with their cynical manipulation of the
expectations game.
</P>
<P>
   Any voter who is paying attention can see that Bush represents
the ideas and principles that are most important to Republicans _
and that Bush is best equipped to defeat the Democrats in November.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Republican Party _ and for the electoral
system _ voters around the country are not required to play the
expectations game. When it's their turn to vote, they can vote for
whichever candidate they choose.
</P>
<P>
   And Republicans will choose Bush.

&HT;     LEGAL TEAM CREATES PRACTICAL RESOURCE FOR BABY BOOMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It was only noon on a recent Friday, but Walter
Burke appeared weary as he rubbed his right hand over a white
beard.
</P>
<P>
   The Albany lawyer was looking at a typically busy day. Burke had
already met with a client whose spouse has Alzheimer's disease.
Before that he had taken an urgent call from another client who had
been hospitalized with a mysterious back ailment. An appointment to
discuss financial arrangements for a child's college tuition
awaited. Later that day he would attend a funeral for yet another
client.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find that many people when they come to see us are upset or
confused,'' said Burke, co-founder of the 12-year-old firm Burke
Casserly &AMP; Gable, P.C. ``They don't know how to approach a problem,
because it isn't their area of expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke and his partner, Timothy Casserly, are hoping they can
bridge the gap many people face when dealing with personal,
financial and legal problems. Along with two other colleagues, they
have written an impressively practical resource book titled
``Boomer Basics'' ($24.95, McGraw Hill).
</P>
<P>
   ``This book is not an academic exercise. This is real life,''
Burke explained. ``The experiences we deal with every day are what
went into planning this book.''
</P>
<P>
   Their 436-page book, supplemented by a companion Web site
(http://www.boomerbasics.com), would seem to have something for
almost every one of the estimated 78 million baby boomers in the
United States. While it features plenty of advice, ``Boomer
Basics'' is even more valuable as a reference tool. Most entries
offer Web sites for obtaining additional information, and the
28-page appendix is devoted exclusively to listing resources with
Internet addresses, phone numbers and street addresses.
</P>
<P>
   The book is divided into three basic sections: ourselves, our
children and our parents. Each chapter provides in-depth
information and pertinent resources from government, nonprofit and
proprietary organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Said Casserly, 40, who is also a certified financial planner:
``Nobody wants to bring up financial planning. For many people,
it's not an easy subject to approach with their aging parents. But
you need to plan and save.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This (book) is designed to help formulate what the questions
are that people should be asking. Boomers by and large are very
capable people,'' Casserly said. ``Certainly they are capable of
doing plenty of things themselves. That makes our job that much
easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke, 53, and Casserly are half of the ``Boomer Basics''
writing team. The other two authors are Robert Abrams, a Long
Island attorney who specializes in elder law, and Barbara Nodiff, a
registered nurse and president of a health care consulting firm
that provides services to nursing facilities and adult homes.
</P>
<P>
   This was all new territory for Burke and Casserly. Neither
attorney had previously written anything beyond a legal brief, with
the exception of occasional articles for professional journals. Now
their hard-cover book, released at the end of January, is in
bookstores nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe one of the reasons it took us so long to complete the
book is that we tried our best to make it a very basic planning
book,'' Burke said. ``The easiest thing for us as lawyers to do is
to confuse people. We've tried hard to avoid doing that. Hopefully
we've succeeded.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet neither author has any great expectations about cracking the
best-seller lists. If so, they aren't sharing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I check the sales on Amazon all the time,'' Casserly mused.
``We're in the top 800,000. I think one day we were even in the top
700,000.''

&HT;     WHEN WORKER INITIATIVE TOPS VANILLA ICE CREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Consultant and author Bob Nelson has heard all
sorts of useful and unusual workplace stories, but he would have to
go a long way to top the one about the man whose Pontiac wouldn't
start every time he bought vanilla ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest book, ``1,001 Ways to Take Initiative at Work,''
Nelson describes how the man sent a letter to the Pontiac Division
of the General Motors Corp., explaining that his family went out
for ice cream after dinner each night. When they bought any flavor
except vanilla, the car started fine. But with vanilla, the car
wouldn't cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   GM sent an engineer to visit the man, and he rode with him for
several nights of ice cream purchases, proving to himself that the
story was true. The baffled engineer started jotting down details
about each visit, such as the type of gasoline and the time it took
to drive back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a short time, he had a clue: The man took less time to buy
vanilla than any other flavor,'' Nelson writes. ``Why? The answer
was in the layout of the store. Vanilla, being the most popular
flavor, was in a separate case at the front of the store for quick
pickup. All the other flavors were kept in the back of the store at
a different counter, where it took considerably longer to find the
flavor and get checked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the question for the engineer was why the car wouldn't
start when it took less time. Once time became the problem, the
engineer quickly came up with the answer: vapor lock. It was
happening every night, but the extra time it took to get the other
flavors allowed the engine to cool down sufficiently to start. When
the man got vanilla, the engine was still too hot for the vapor
lock to dissipate.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview in San Francisco, Nelson said many
employees fail to get ahead because they don't show the kind of
initiative that the engineer did. They do only what their bosses
tell them without understanding that some managers are too out of
touch to know what customers need.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest internal factor holding them back is an often
unreasonable fear of getting reprimanded, Nelson said. ``You're
afraid you made your boss look bad because you looked good.''
</P>
<P>
   A clerk at 800-CEO-READ took a risk when an employee at a large
pharmaceutical company called to ask for a business book. The book
was out of print, but the clerk called the author in The
Netherlands, obtained a copy of the book, and had it shipped
directly to the client.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the clerk or the Pontiac engineer could have been
reprimanded by short-sighted bosses for spending so much time on a
single customer, but Nelson said adding those customer service
touches enhances a company's reputation. ``If you're not doing
that, I guarantee you the start-up company next to you is.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said the bookstore employee's action carried a huge
bonus: The pharmaceutical company had called five bookstores with
the same request, but his was the only store that found a copy of
the book. Now the company buys all its books through that store.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, 'Why would we want to order from anyone else?'''
Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Employees who go out of their way to help customers or suggest
improvements for the company do it all the time, not just on a rare
occasion, Nelson said. ``You get a reputation as someone who makes
it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   If you have a good idea and a clueless manager, sometimes you
have to fight for it and show why it can succeed, Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   The book also tells the story of an idealistic IBM programmer,
Jay Elliot, who sent a 20-page letter to company chairman Tom
Watson Jr. after Watson had criticized how America was handling the
Vietnam War. Elliott said Watson should look at how poorly his own
company was operating, and included many detailed suggestions for
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of firing Elliot, Watson was so impressed that he met
with Elliot and helped him along toward a successful career, first
at IBM and then at other organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said that unlike Watson, however, many managers say they
want employees to show initiative, but do little to actively
encourage it.
</P>
<P>
   He said inertia often stops employers and workers from doing
what they can to improve. Nelson added that even workers in
seemingly dead-end jobs should focus on doing their tasks as
efficiently and creatively as possible because that will often
impress a manager enough to get them promoted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere I go, everyone focuses on what they can't do, not
what they can do,'' Nelson said.

 Comfort food and tales for the feverish   &HT;     (For release Tuesday Feb. 22)  
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Someone should make a study to see if sales of People magazine
go up during the flu season along with herb tea and ``Casablanca''
movie rentals.
</P>
<P>
   A magazine, especially one with more pictures than words, is
about as deep as you want to go in a fevered state. This is not the
time for serious thought, which is my excuse for failing to
complete the assigned January reading of ``Wild Swans'' for my book
club. My head could not keep track of three generations of a
Chinese family, as compelling as their stories were. The only thing
the book did was set up a craving for hot and sour soup which is
what I most want when my throat begins to swell and my ears buzz.
</P>
<P>
   Gayanne, when stricken, takes to her bed with all her cats,
drinks strong mint tea and nibbles on ginger cookies. At the start
of the flu she reads People, then, when the eye-burning subsides,
advances to Vanity Fair.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime she doesn't want to talk. ``I don't answer the
phone but I do screen my calls to see if anyone is feeling sorry
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   I read somewhere that Vanessa Redgrave, also under the weather,
was on ``vocal rest,'' which is something most sickies can
understand.
</P>
<P>
   Sara, normally cheerful, deigns when ill to speak only to family
members who bring tea and ``don't need me to make decisions about
moving to New Mexico or buying a sports car.''
</P>
<P>
   When Barbara's sick she wants to be read to. Her father used to
read her A.J. Liebling when she had a high fever. ``Those moments
of having the fever and him sitting next to me reading are forever
in my mind as a good time, even though I felt horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Same with Dee. ``When my mind is mush I want children's books
like ``James and the Giant Peach'' read to me.'' When stronger, she
likes something by Ursula LeGuinn, and as the headache lessens
moves to the New Yorker, ``thus feeling virtuous as well as
self-indulgent.''
</P>
<P>
   An old movie, especially one you've seen before so you don't
have to stay awake for the whole thing, can be a treat when you get
to where you can sit up and focus. Neva recommends ``A Thousand
Clowns'' or ``Mr. Darcy romping about in the BBC version of `Pride
and Prejudice.' ''
</P>
<P>
   One man I know, when bit by the bug, requires ``The African
Queen'' and that thick green nighttime cold medicine which he takes
during daytime, too, and swears by, even though it once spilled on
the night stand and ate the wood.
</P>
<P>
   Vivian endured three rounds of antibiotics this winter and
during the time remembers watching two movies, ``The Parent Trap''
and something with Jim Carrey. But it's possible she was
hallucinating.
</P>
<P>
   Penelope made it through the flu drinking only hot water and
listening to the books-on-tape version of ``The Jewel in the
Crown.''
</P>
<P>
   Those lucky enough to retain an appetite know exactly what they
want and it is usually un-exotic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cornmeal mush, cooked slow, no lumps, Grandma's recipe,'' says
Jane.
</P>
<P>
   Sara believes in bacon with English muffins, and Robin wants
chicken soup with rice, a la Maurice Sendak. Others trust in the
restorative powers of miso soup, matzo ball soup and Campbell's
cream of tomato.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually you'll begin to want something sweet to eat and
bigger to read. When you begin to wean yourself off cough medicine
and stop sleeping in a turtleneck, it will be time for ice cream
and bananas or even a bit of chocolate along with a book worthy of
your time. Perhaps ``Harry Potter.''

A MATTER OF TIME

<P>
   MIAMI _ After three months of protests, political posturing and
nasty family squabbling, the case of 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian
Gonzalez heads to the hushed confines of a federal court here on
Tuesday(2/22).
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler will take up the question
of whether his court has jurisdiction over the boy and whether
Elian's Miami relatives _ who want him to remain in the United
States _ have any right to make claims on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the court hearing _ which could clear the way for
the boy to be returned to his father in Cuba _ comes none too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This boy has faced layer upon layer of stress,'' said Alan
Delamater, a child psychologist at the University of Miami. ``While
kids can be remarkably resilient, all in all I'd say there's a
significant toll on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian was found floating in an inner tube off the coast of Fort
Lauderdale on Thanksgiving Day. His mother and 10 other people
drowned after their small boat capsized on an ill-fated trip from
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Since his rescue, the boy has become the center of an
international tug-of-war, with the government Cuban President Fidel
Castro organizing massive rallies almost daily calling for the
boy's return to Cuba. In Miami, Cuban exiles _ not swayed by polls
showing most Americans favoring Elian's return _ have protested,
saying he should be kept here rather than sent back to an
impoverished future on the Communist island.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno upheld a decision
by federal immigration officials that Elian should be returned to
his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, in Cuba. But Reno stopped short
of forcibly removing the boy from the Miami home of his
great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, who has cared for him since his
rescue from the Florida Straits.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami family then filed a federal lawsuit aimed at blocking
Reno's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's long-awaited hearing will take up a motion by
government lawyers to dismiss the case. Their primary argument is
that immigration decisions are a matter for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, and not the courts. They also contend the
Miami family has no legal standing because immigration officials
correctly ruled that Elian's father is the only one with the legal
right to speak for him.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say the law is squarely behind the government's
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no question,'' said David Abraham, a
University of Miami law professor who specializes in immigration
matters. ``Immigration admissions decisions are not reviewable by
the courts. The law is clear and has been clear from the outset.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Miami family, however, argue that the boy should
be given the chance to apply for asylum in this country, and that
failing to do so denies him of his constitutional rights. They also
asked Hoeveler to honor a ruling by a Miami-Dade County family
court giving custody of Elian to Lazaro Gonzalez, or to appoint an
independent guardian to care for the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has ignored the family court ruling, saying that
immigration matters are solely a federal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   If Hoeveler decides he has no jurisdiction in the case or the
Miami family has no legal standing, the family could appeal to the
11th Circuit Court in Atlanta. That process could take days, if not
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But if Hoeveler decides he has jurisdiction and the family has a
right to pursue the lawsuit, he would hold another hearing on the
merits of the case during the week of March 6.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the sparring over the boy has continued. Cuban
officials have charged that two of the great-uncles now caring for
Elian have been arrested for drunken driving, demonstrating their
lack of suitability to care for him.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, Juan Miguel, has also written two letters to
Reno in recent weeks decrying the delays in the case, and asking
that the boy be moved to live with other Miami relatives who favor
sending him back to Cuba and allowing Cuban officials to visit the
boy.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has also repeatedly said he will not come to this
country to claim his son, and in his second letter to Reno said he
refuses to recognize the jurisdiction of U.S. courts over the
matter, dashing speculation that he might travel to Miami for the
court hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives, meanwhile, have constructed a privacy
fence around their Little Havana home and asked that the media
scale back its constant coverage of the case. They have also
expressed outrage that one of Elian's grandmothers teased the boy
by biting him and unzipping his pants during a much-publicized
visit in early February.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, psychologists say Elian has suffered
enough trauma _ the loss of his mother, being left alone in the
ocean, the swarm of media following his every move _ to upset even
the most stable person.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the surface he may be doing well, but as far as the long
term, it's clear he will have a lot to deal with,'' said Wade Horn,
a child psychologist and founder of the National Fatherhood
Initiative, which promotes responsible fatherhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern for him is what happens afterwards,'' Horn added.
``If he stays here, he could grow up with a tremendous sense of
guilt about not going back to his father. But if he goes, he may
come to resent losing the life he could've had here.''

 &HT;    PALESTINIAN CAVEDWELLERS OUSTED IN MIDEAST BATTLE FOR 'FACTS ON
THE GROUND'
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Feb. 20 And Thereafter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   A-TWANI, West Bank _ Life in a cave was good for Ibrahim Abu
Jundiyeh, but his family lost even that meager existence in the
fight for the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were happy. We were joyous in the cave. We had our land,''
Abu Jundiyeh said. They had rugs on the dirt floor, an entrance of
stone blocks and a few hundred square yards for his wife, 11
children and their livestock to spread out.
</P>
<P>
   But they were among about 450 people, according to the Israeli
human rights group B'Tselem, that the Israeli army has evicted from
caves in the rocky Hebron hills since October.
</P>
<P>
   The families say they had been in the caves for generations.
Now, many have gone to tents and borrowed homes in the villages
nearby, some of the poorest in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   They complain that many of their goats and sheep, which shared
their large caves at night, have died from cold. The children have
coughs too, after months of winter rain and a snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather die than live like this,'' said Abu Jundiyeh,
50.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Army officials said Abu Jundiyeh and the others had to
be moved because they were in a military zone set aside for
light-weapons target practice. Palestinians say they never hear
weapons firing and claim such military zones are just excuses for
land confiscation.
</P>
<P>
   The cave dwellers appear to be caught amid the jostling of the
Oslo peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Under Oslo, Israel is withdrawing from land in the West Bank
captured in 1967. But there are about 150 Jewish settlements,
really housing developments, spread throughout the area.
</P>
<P>
   The settlements are part of the battle for ``facts on the
ground'' in the West Bank. The idea is that final rulings about who
gets land will be determined by who is living there at the time.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say the settlements create obstacles to a peace
agreement. Under pressure to stop their growth, the Israeli
government last fall evicted militant settlers from about a dozen
new outposts they had established.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Jundiyeh's eviction _ and subsequent arrest for eight days
when he refused to move _ came Nov. 16, just a few days after
Jewish settlers were evicted from the Ma'on Farm settlement nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The army told the settlers they could not stay in a firing
range, and the leaders of the 170,000-strong settler movement
pointed to the several hundred cave dwellers, demanding they be
cleared out too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a war going on for my country,'' said Yehudit Tayar,
spokeswoman for the settlers leadership council. ``The decisions
that are going to be made are going to be very dependent on where
everybody is.''
</P>
<P>
   Shlomo Dror, spokesman for the Israel's military administration
of the West Bank, said that other cave dwellers in firing ranges
have been evicted over the last several years. They are regularly
allowed back to tend their fields.
</P>
<P>
   He says the cave families have other homes and are only in the
tents because Palestinian leaders want to use them as facts on the
ground against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But, some of the army's harshest critics come from Israel
itself. Israeli peace groups, for example, have helped Palestinian
groups provide tents and medical care to the cave dwellers.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, seven Israeli writers signed a public plea for
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to let the cave dwellers go home.
The list included literary notables as Amos Oz and A.B. Yehoshua.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel ashamed about what we are doing, for what our army
is doing,'' said author David Grossman, who signed the letter. ``I
have seen a lot of injustice in the last 15 years, but it is very
rare that you see such an injustice so clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Grossman said that even if the cave dwellers have other homes _
and many deny that they do _ cave life has been their chosen way
for generations.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Mahmoud Hussein Hamamdeh, lost two caves where his
family and livestock lived. Now, he is borrowing a dirt-floor,
stone house here in A-Twani.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will wait to return to my land,'' he said, ``Or, I will die
here.''

<P>
   Throughout the first half hour of ``Diamonds,'' our intrepid
protagonists drive around Canada and the Pacific Northwest in a
vintage red convertible. With the top down. In late winter. Without
a hat to warm their ears.
</P>
<P>
   Not to rain (or snow) on their parade, but the spectacle of
actors baring their cheeks to the wind _ winter be damned! _ in
knee-jerk obeisance to the Hollywood buddy flick does not bode well
for the film. It smacks of contrivance. And when a movie starts out
contrived, it has nowhere to go but down.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, ``Diamonds'' is not utterly charmless. Au contraire.
It has a few things going for it, not the least of which is
83-year-old Kirk Douglas in his first role since suffering a stroke
four years ago. Douglas limps and slurs his words, but none of that
keeps him from turning in a performance of stubborn, impish
vitality. ``A stroke is God's way of trying to make me shut up _
but it didn't work!'' he says, his improbable chin dimples no worse
for the wear.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas plays Harry Agensky, an aged ex-boxer who once pummeled
his way to a welterweight championship as the ``Polish Prince.''
The scrappy Harry (shown in flashback, courtesy 51-year-old boxing
scenes from Douglas' ``Champion'') is recovering from a stroke at a
son's home in Canada, where he puckers up to an ``Oral Aerobics''
videotape and talks wistfully of his days in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Then, one day, Harry's other son _ the sour Lance (Dan Aykroyd)
_ pulls up the snowy driveway in his alfresco automobile. With
Lance is Harry's puckish teen-age grandson, Michael (Corbin
Allred). When Harry tells Michael that a gangster named Duff the
Muff once gave him 13 diamonds to throw a fight, Michael convinces
Lance to kidnap grandpa and whisk him down to Reno, where Harry
swears he stashed the loot in the Muff's kitchen wall. So off they
go, the Agensky boys, three generations bickering their way to
Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   They all have their issues. Michael thinks his dad is a wimp.
Lance thinks his dad never cared. (``Why don't you admit you
weren't there when I needed you!'' he whines.) Harry, who mourns
the death of his beloved wife, tends to fly off and punch people.
Once they arrive in Reno they engage in all manner of naughtiness,
hitting it big in casinos and, when Harry complains he hasn't had
sex in several years, tracking down a brothel.
</P>
<P>
   The brothel scene is beyond absurd _ oh, sure, wink-wink, any
middle-class dad would hire prostitutes for himself, his old father
and virgin son _ but it does introduce Lauren Bacall into the film,
as Sin-Dee, the hookers' stylish madam.
</P>
<P>
   It's been half a century since she and Douglas have appeared
onscreen together (in ``Young Man with a Horn,'' 1950), and the
sight of these two legends glowing together on screen is just about
worth the ticket. They blush like embers. As artificial and
concocted as it is, the movie boasts a few clear moments of warmth;
the warmest of all are Douglas and Bacall's.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it's sweetness that saves ``Diamonds'' from the
black pit of bad movies _ sweetness and star power, the greater
vintage the better. The film was directed by John Asher (who made
the execrable ``Kounterfeit'') from a screenplay by comedian Allan
Aaron Katz, and it succeeds where other, better movies fail: In
giving the old folks a chance to shine.
</P>
<P>
   Senior citizens aren't demonized in ``Diamonds,'' and they
aren't saps; when was the last time a movie made a hero of a guy
recovering from a stroke? As Harry asks of a condescending
youngster, ``I'm just old _ is that a crime?'' Not by a long shot.
And not while Douglas is around, poking his proud jaw at the world.

&HT;     ``BOILER ROOM'': HOT TIMES ON WALL STREET 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The arrogant, lying, obnoxious, bigoted, misogynistic, scummy,
self-satisfied, cold-hearted young stockbrokers who mill around the
insides of the newly released ``Boiler Room'' know what's
important. Ferraris are important. Tanning beds are important.
Shiny ties are important.
</P>
<P>
   But all such things pale in comparison to the single most
important struggle of their lives: Memorizing Michael Douglas'
dialogue from ``Wall Street.'' Gordon Gekko is their paragon, their
guru, a demigod of the mighty buck who shows them the road to
excess. There's no irony in their adulation _ no inkling that maybe
avarice led to Gekko's downfall and might similarly lead to theirs.
Greed is good, Gekko said. Slumped on a leather couch, belting out
chunks of dialogue like drunken sailors, his Gen-X disciples might
object: It's not good. It's awesome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boiler Room'' is packed with ``Wall Street'' references, to
the point that it feels less like a piece of original filmmaking
than a hip-hop homage to Oliver Stone. Like the rap songs that
slink on the soundtrack, the movie doesn't so much allude to other
films as samples them directly _ a scene here, a character there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glengarry Glen Ross'' (another film about the desperate quest
for moolah) pops up when Ben Affleck, heretofore unrecognized as
Alec Baldwin's Mini-Me, delivers a mock-up of Baldwin's
``Always-Be-Closing'' speech in ``Glengarry'' that's as brazen as
it is cocky. First he tells us he's about to rip it off, then he
rips it off directly. Hey, at least he's honest.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by first-time writer-director Ben Younger, ``Boiler
Room'' thrums with testosterone _ it's all young fellas with fat,
clacking egos. In the middle of it all sits Seth (Giovanni Ribisi,
looking soulful but somewhat ill), a smart young trainee at a
fly-by-night Long Island brokerage firm that pulls in mysteriously
huge lumps of money.
</P>
<P>
   Seth has been running an illegal casino in his living room _ to
the dismay of his judge-dad, played by an austere Ron Rifkin _ but
has bigger plans for bigger money. As he says in narration, ``I
didn't want to be an innovator _ I just wanted to make a quick
buck. I wanted in.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick bucks abound at J.T. Marlin, where Seth learns the ropes
from the oily Greg (Nicky Katt, beautifully venal), the weaselly
Adam (Jamie Kennedy), the thuggish Richie (Scott Caan), the lordly
Jim (Tom Everett Scott) and the decent Chris (Vin Diesel). About 80
percent of the film consists of Young Turks screaming broker-lingo
at each other and duplicitous come-ons into phones, at the other
end of which lurk unsuspecting schmos preparing to invest their
nest eggs in lousy stock. (One of the schmos, played by Whit
Stillman regular Taylor Nichols, is a heartbreaker.) The rest of
the film belongs to Seth's scenes with his dad, with his girlfriend
(Nia Long, dazed but dignified) and with Duh Guys.
</P>
<P>
   At various points Seth noses around in the brokerage's shady
dealings, which catches the attention of the FBI, which brings on
the requisite scenes of bland feds listening to phone taps. We've
seen it all before.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Younger's film is strangely watchable: In paying respect to
``Wall Street'' and ``Glengarry Glen Ross,'' it picks up on both
films' rat-a-tat rhythms and blowhard energy. Younger's script is
as foul-mouthed and epithet-laden as you'd expect from a David
Mamet wannabe, and Enrique Chediak's whirling photography captures
the crazy eddies of a day in the firm.
</P>
<P>
   There's some sick fun in watching a roomful of ambitious churls
duping people out of their life savings; it's fun because we know
they're playing out some warped fantasia on the American Dream.
``Boiler Room'' asks ``Who wants to be a millionaire?'' and it
answers, finally: everybody.

&HT;     `HANGING UP': SORORITY FLICK WITHOUT MUCH HUMOR 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WESLEY MORRIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somewhere between Betty Friedan and Helen Reddy stands Diane
Keaton. The women she has played are a staggering congress
representing female independence, though her neurotic shtick often
seemed to be apologizing for trying to make it after all.
</P>
<P>
   Her notions of quirky, do-it-yourself feminism always made room
for General Foods International Coffee moments among three sisters,
biological and cosmic alike. ``Interiors,'' ``Crimes of the
Heart,'' ``The Lemon Sisters,'' ``The First Wives Club'' and, now,
the deadliest of these felicitous sorority movies _ ``Hanging Up.''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Keaton, Meg Ryan and Lisa Kudrow, the story unites the
half-lives of three slapstick women. What's cruel and unusual is
how deeply unfunny it is. The comedy comes on cute and noisy, and
ends in a fit of female bonding so sweet you'll be reaching for the
insulin.
</P>
<P>
   Keaton directs ``Hanging Up'' as though she's longing for all
those embarrassing post-``9 to 5'' comedies about the stress of
working mothers. (Keaton made a box-office comeback in 1987 with
``Baby Boom,'' the sub-genre's nadir.)
</P>
<P>
   Working from a script by real sisters Nora and Delia Ephron,
Keaton moves things along like she has the keys to an
Oprah-friendly ``King Lear,'' with three versions of Mary Tyler
Moore playing each of the sisters, and poor, old Walter Matthau as
the dying dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hanging Up'' is an Avon party, black-clad in Donna Karan and
littered with tics, stammers and fidgeting, mostly courtesy of
Ryan, who under Keaton's direction has never been more irritating.
When calibrated, her screwball artistry is a fun throwback, but the
pratfalls, sidelong glances, frustrated line deliveries and giddy,
mock-appalled facial expressions are like watching Jennifer Love
Hewitt star in ``I Want To Live!''
</P>
<P>
   Keaton has clearly found camaraderie; she loves Ryan's physical
comedy and lets her go nuts. So Ryan spends most of the film
looking like she's trying to wake up from a nightmare and kvetching
over what a nagging neurotic she's become. ``I feel like the blond,
bland actress in one of those '50s movies, who's short and always
suffering,'' she complains. Now, that's film criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan plays Eve, the middle child who's been stuck with the
responsibility of caring for their dying pa, who hasn't been right
since ma (Cloris Leachman catching the Agnes Moorehead spirit)
walked out years ago, tired of the wife-and-mother gig. Eve's
trying to get her two manic, aloof sisters _ Georgia (Keaton) and
Maddy (Lisa Kudrow) _ to help her.
</P>
<P>
   Dad's hit rock bottom and has to be hospitalized. But Georgia's
too busy to deal with it: She's on her cell phone with Vanity Fair
scandal-monger Maureen Orth and planning the fifth anniversary of
her self-titled magazine. And Maddy, the flaky baby of the three,
is in denial, too preoccupied with her dog and her role on a soap
to believe her daddy's dying. (What exactly is wrong with Matthau's
irascible dad remains a mystery: Is it Tourette's? Jack Lemmon
withdrawal?)
</P>
<P>
   Writer/director Nora Ephron seems to have given Keaton extensive
crib notes. The qualities of Keaton's previous outings as a
director _ the fleeting, contemplative ``Heaven'' and ``Unstrung
Heroes'' _ are missing. But she does make movies the way ex-beau
Warren Beatty does: with a lot of self-love.
</P>
<P>
   Keaton, though, is far less ambitious and more democratic in her
technique, making sure Kudrow, who exists mostly in reaction shots,
and Ryan look as fabulous as she does. If your girlfriends won't
make sure you're lit right, who will?
</P>
<P>
   Keaton's shot-making is ``Hanging Up's'' most criminal offense:
The three sisters power-walking side-by-side down a hospital
corridor, intercut with quick glimpses of their calves and the
black pumps that keep them flexed; Keaton on the cover of a
magazine in a power suit with a cigar in her mouth; and that last
awful sequence in which the girls have a big flour fight.
</P>
<P>
   The thesis in the Ephrons' adaptation of Delia's book is that
these ultra-successful women's lives are so hectic that they're
connected only by telephone. It's a peculiarly L.A. story that
Keaton coats with enough emotional Teflon to withstand any tragedy.
But what grates most heavily in this overly written editorial to
``having it all'' is the nonstop chaos. It's as if each of these
women has tossed her hat in the air and has to spend the movie
trying to figure out why it hasn't come down.

&HT;     CROSSOVER VOTES WON'T HELP MCCAIN OR BRADLEY IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service Clients)  
 &HT;     By RICHARD A. RUBIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ We are in the midst of the most exciting
presidential contest since insurgent supporters of George McGovern
tried to seize the White House from the Nixonites in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   This is happening not because of any revival of interest in
either of the two major political parties or their preferred
candidates. It's happening because of an unusually large influx of
voters who generally sit out elections or vote as independents.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain's burgeoning candidacy as a populist from the
right has galvanized these voters. Former Sen. Bill Bradley, to a
lesser extent, is doing the same thing in running from the left.
</P>
<P>
   Each challenges a basically centrist voting pattern that has
defined almost every presidential election since Dwight
Eisenhower's victory over Adlai Stevenson in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley and McCain are on a collision course with new
election rules in California for the March 7 primary in which both
must do well if they are to remain legitimate contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The ``open primary'' was promoted as a means of increasing
participation by letting voters cross party lines. This system is a
boon to Republican or Democratic voters bent on mischief or
disgruntled enough to want to make a statement by casting votes for
the opposite party's candidate.
</P>
<P>
   It is also an invitation to the growing pool of independent
voters looking for alternatives like McCain or Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   However, the smart money says the big winners will be George W.
Bush and Al Gore, the two establishment candidates who have
received benedictions from most of the state's elected leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The new election laws, aided by the heightened interest in the
McCain and Bradley candidacies, may increase voter turnout
significantly, but this probably will do little to change the final
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Neither McCain nor Bradley stands to benefit directly from the
millions of potential cross-over ballots. That's because only the
registered voters of each candidate's party are counted in the
crucial delegate selection that determines the nominees, and
California has a winner-take-all system.
</P>
<P>
   Thus McCain could beat out Bush in the popular vote and not gain
a single delegate. Were this to happen, we might want to consider
giving California's open primary a name change to ``orphan
primary'' _ sowing only bitterness and disillusionment for those
voters who thought they had found a true home.
</P>
<P>
   So, while the winds of reform may blow strongly across New
Hampshire, California and elsewhere, giving new voice to alienated
voters and revitalizing an electorate that has been dormant for
much of the past half century, centrist candidates and entrenched
power structures are destined to crush insurgent candidacies.

&HT;     `SOPRANOS': AS GET AS IT GETS ON TV 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TIM GOODMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no legislating opinion, so there's no point in telling
people who don't like ``The Sopranos'' that they are wrong. It's
perfectly acceptable _ even expected _ for people to dislike the
HBO show.
</P>
<P>
   If you fall in the ranks of the disappointed or the unimpressed,
consider this: ``The Sopranos'' is breaking conventional television
constraints every week, often so subtly it goes unnoticed, and
unappreciated.
</P>
<P>
   American television viewers have been conditioned through the
years to reject gray for black and white, a delicate touch for the
anvil. And we're not talking here about ``WWF Smackdown!'' or
low-brow sitcoms. Shows that are considered our finest offerings _
``ER'' and ``NYPD Blue'' and ``The Practice'' _ are rife with
crowd-pleasing theatrics and predictable structure, easily grasped
moments and a creative conservatism masquerading as something fresh
and challenging.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't make them bad, or unenjoyable. But they're
pandering.
</P>
<P>
   Those show are remarkable mostly for finding a formula several
notches above a more obvious, easily dismissed formula that we've
come to expect from Hollywood. That they get ratings and have loyal
viewers is a wonderful thing.
</P>
<P>
   If ``The Sopranos'' played by those rules every week, guns would
be going off continuously, there would be a lot more Big Moments,
and a good deal more tears and staged drama. Luckily, creator David
Chase and his stable of writers and actors have chosen a different
path. And that's why ``The Sopranos'' is the best show on
television, period.
</P>
<P>
   Even some staunch ``Sopranos'' fans thought the first episode
from season two was slow, uneven, or lacked impact. Compared to the
faux dramatic puppetry of ``ER'' and the ``Let's do something with
Sipowicz'' tendency of ``NYPD Blue,'' yeah, they're right. And
after the hallucinogenic glare of that off-season ``Sopranos''
hype, who could blame them for missing the difference between
brilliant and very good?
</P>
<P>
   Consider this: Chase could have started this second season by
blowing up Tony's house, having a turf war or having Tony and his
mother kiss and make up at her deathbed. But he didn't. He stayed
true to his method _ calmness amid potential chaos.
</P>
<P>
   No show on television has more silence than ``The Sopranos.''
Chase uses quiet moments like others use car wrecks. This is
essential to understanding the series. On network television, those
scenes would vanish. The formula calls for building up drama, or
laughs, right before a commercial break. It's like clockwork. It's
such an obvious treatment that, through years and years of watching
television, we're oblivious to it.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Sopranos'' flows differently. Think back two weeks
when Tony and his crew went to Italy. On a network, this would have
been blown out of proportion. ``Tony Soprano goes to Italy! A clash
of cultures!'' But that's not how Chase chose to play the episode.
A great deal of it, in fact, took place in Tony's head. How many
times did Tony look at someone _ the Mafia daughter running the
show over there, the aging Don, the culture itself _ and say
nothing?
</P>
<P>
   The camera lingered on him simply thinking.
</P>
<P>
   At its most basic, ``The Sopranos'' is a show about what is
going on in Tony Soprano's head. The series is fortunate to have
James Gandolfini bring to life a very complicated character. While
his rage is exciting to witness, his facial features are far more
revealing. Just a half-smile or smirk, a raised eyebrow, a
death-glare or that look of lost control is more effective than any
yelling or gun fire could ever be.
</P>
<P>
   That we don't appreciate this _ much less know what to do with
it  &Cx1f; _ says more about what television is doing to us as viewers,
and less about what ``The Sopranos'' is failing to do with the
notion of action and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   If you're taping ``The Sopranos,'' save an episode you thought
was boring, or lifeless. Take another look. Appreciate the little
things: like the characters have gained weight. No models here.
Look at the clothes they wear _ Jersey perfect. Just like Tony's
suburban house. Listen to the dialogue and pause on that moment
when one of them makes a casual aside. It probably reveals
something true about their character. And it would probably have
been cut from ``ER.'' Too slow.
</P>
<P>
   Some viewers respond best to the cool elements of the show. The
music. The dialogue. The deft use of dream sequences or tricky
camera moves. It's all good. But the greatness comes from the
acting and the tone, which are intertwined. The small, quiet,
seemingly inconsequential moments _ the long pauses or impotent
rage played out in silence _ those are the defining moments of the
series.
</P>
<P>
   As viewers, we have a hard time grasping the unspoken, the lack
of action. We feel lost in a scene that's not familiar, when we
can't predict where it's going or why it's taking place. Some
people may never appreciate the inside of Tony's head. But make no
mistake about it _ that's where the real action takes place.
</P>
<P>
   If Chase and Gandolfini and the writers and some of the other
actors deserve Emmys (and they do) for their contributions to ``The
Sopranos,'' then there ought to be some other kind of prize for
leading us down another path to enlightenment from our predictable,
formulaic TV ignorance. Backlash be damned.

WHY NOT JUST BUY A BRIDE THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY?

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   American television will sink to depths heretofore unimaginable
in order to attract viewers during these all-important February
ratings weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Acting as an electronic pimp for women eager to copulate with a
millionaire is just the latest low.
</P>
<P>
   How else can one describe the Fox network's ``Who Wants to Marry
a Multi-Millionaire?'' That sounds base, particularly to those
purportedly sweet things who were eager to line up for a shot at
being bagged by the guy with big bucks, but the show's premise was
little more than selling off a woman in an exchange of sex for
money. The network got its handling fee in ratings.
</P>
<P>
   It matters not that each willing contestant was promised a
``dream wedding'' by show producers if she was the ultimate winner
_ it amounted to a modern-day version of parading perfumed
concubines before Pharaoh.
</P>
<P>
   One wonders if the people making the creative decisions for
television these days aren't devotees of the ancient church in
Thyatira, found in the Book of Revelation. Jezebel, the prophetess
of fornication and idolatry, ruled the day. Sounds like Hollywood
in 2000 to me.
</P>
<P>
   To those who think I'm over-reacting to a TV show that no one
was forced to participate in, I make no apologies. Trivializing the
most sacred vow that a man and woman will ever exchange isn't
amusing.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of arranged marriages for financial benefit is, of
course, not new. That doesn't mean it should be celebrated with its
own two-hour prime-time special. If only it could be reported that
the idea fell flatter than the walls of Jericho. Alas, hundreds of
women lined up for the opportunity to wed a complete stranger whose
only known attribute was a bank balance that Midas would covet.
</P>
<P>
   Have these women no pride? Apparently not. And neither do some
of their family members. New Jersey resident Beverly Gibson
admitted to pushing her daughter Wendy, a marine biology major at
Jacksonville University in Florida, to take part in the nationwide
search that unearthed 50 women willing to marry Mr. Rich on live TV
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up, Wendy always wanted her own aquarium and zoo. How
else would she get this but to marry a millionaire?'' Gibson said
to an Associated Press reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting family values. Gee, Mrs. Gibson, how 'bout Wendy
earns it somehow other than on her back?
</P>
<P>
   Wendy reportedly willingly filled out the application, which
asked her height, weight and desire to have children. But according
to the AP story, ``the football cheerleader became a bit
apprehensive when a reporter told her that the man's identity would
not be revealed until the beginning of the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendy's mom kept telling her that this was ``an opportunity of a
lifetime.'' That's nauseating just to read.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of the prenuptial agreements that each woman had to
sign weren't disclosed, but don't think for one minute that Mr.
Rich would risk his multi-millions on an unknown without an
iron-clad pre-nup guaranteeing that the new Mrs. Rich can't attach
one shiny dime of his dough should this match made in Las Vegas go
south.
</P>
<P>
   According to a show publicist, Mr. Rich also signed a pre-nup,
promising not to go after his new bride's assets _ the financial
ones, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Just imagine the ratings when Mr. and Mrs. Rich are the featured
couple before Judge Mablean Ephriam on a prime-time version of
``Divorce Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the TV suits aren't entirely to blame here. They
couldn't produce this kind of dreck without the presence of two
important elements: people willing to be exploited and viewers
willing to watch the exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   Network execs are focused on one thing when they develop
programs: the TV ``off'' button. Why raise the bar of decency when
millions of people continue to tune in to shows that specialize in
degradation _ and advertisers line up to peddle their wares on such
shows?
</P>
<P>
   I didn't watch ``Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?,'' so I
can't tell you if Wendy made the cut, who Mr. Rich turned out to
be, or which of the ``lucky'' 50 exchanged vows to become Mrs.
Rich. But to the 49 women who didn't ``win,'' I suggest that they
prepare for a change in the way people view them. They went from
being lonely women unable to find a mate to prostitutes,
high-priced though they may be. And Mr. Rich is nothing more than a
well-heeled john.
</P>
<P>
   When the Lord does come back and takes a good look around, he
might decide he owes an apology to Sodom and Gomorrah.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    PARIS _ ``Globalization'' has become the ever-more-contentious
focus of the new battle of ideas.
 &HT;    The protests are proliferating: from the disorder in Seattle, to
the pickets at Davos to last week's cream pie stuffed in the face
of a surprised Michel Camdessus, the retiring head of the
International Monetary Fund, in Bangkok.
 &HT;    Of course, the protests aren't getting anywhere very quickly and
that's at least partly because people mean so many different things
by globalization.
 &HT;    For businessmen, trade officials and bankers, globalization is a
straightforward, practical phenomenon displayed by statistics. It
is the result of new advanced technology and the removal of
restrictions on global commerce and market innovation.
 &HT;    For example, Hungary's minister of economic affairs, whose name
is Attila Chikam, believes that globalization is definitely good.
For him, there is no argument. It has brought a 15-fold increase in
world trade, a four-fold increase in production and a doubling of
per capita income. Taking an active part in this frenzied,
worldwide economic activity is clearly the way for Hungary to
prosper.
 &HT;    A.T. Kearney, the management-consulting unit of Electronic Data
Systems Corp., the U.S. computer services firm, released the
results of its 18-month study of globalization. It traced the
effects on 34 countries of integration into the world economy. The
accompanying ``globalization index'' showed that nations that
opened up their markets to free trade the most had not only faster
economic growth but also striking improvement in social indicators
_ education, life expectancy and infant mortality, even cleaner
water.
 &HT;    The consultants conceded that inequality _ that is, the
rich-poor income gap _ has also widened and that in this game there
are losers as well as winners, but the statistics weigh heavily on
the plus side.
 &HT;    But to the leftist students who just gave up a nine-month strike
at Mexico's national university or to the poets in Seattle's
pleasant coffee bars, statistics are not the issue. Such young
people are perhaps the most radical foes of globalization. Their
views do, however, reflect the more widespread feeling that
``globalization'' is bad, exploitative and demeaning.
 &HT;    As Julia Preston, the New York Times' correspondent, put it, for
the university students, ``the new adversary _ globalism _ was
faceless. It was a product of commerce and technology more than of
government and guns.'' For them, the battle against the world
corporate ethos as yet offers a faceless enemy and nothing to put
in its place, unlike the old clear-cut struggle of communism
against capitalism.
 &HT;    In reality, the Mexican students' strike was provoked by a
government plan to charge about $150 per year tuition for the first
time in decades. The students at the underfunded school argued it
was a pro-business plot to deny poor students a rightful education,
a way to impose private commercial logic on a public institution.
 &HT;    In fact, these students were trying to resist a whole social
order, even if they couldn't define any alternative. The underlying
protest at globalization, the urge to resist even when the benefits
seem evident, stems from yet another implicit meaning of the term:
Everything seems to be about ``buy more, spend more.''
 &HT;    In today's commercial environment, books and films and pop songs
are rated not so much by quality as by the number of sales.
Entertainers, athletes and even high-profile CEOs are identified as
preeminent by their well-publicized incomes, not their qualitative
or emotional appeal.
 &HT;    The values of globalization appear to be utterly and totally
concerned with money and, at least for some, this leaves a sense of
dessication, a feeling that invisible forces have squeezed the
cultural and emotional juice out of society.
 &HT;    People are looking for values to cherish but the aridity of
economics offers little. The collapse of ideological promise for
those who felt socialism would offer it has so far left nothing but
consumerism as the goal.
 &HT;    Certainly, that isn't enough, but it is misleading and
disquieting to lump so much together under ``globalization.'' There
is no inevitable conflict between global free trade and a variety
of social, intellectual and aesthetic values. Information
technology can make both available, but that doesn't mean one
consumes the other.
 &HT;    What is needed is a more energetic expression and celebration of
the non-commercial benefits of our new century. Call it quality of
global life, whatever, it's no menace.

<P>
   The return of U.N. arms inspectors to Iraq would do more harm
than good.
</P>
<P>
   This is true no matter how robust is the successor to the U.N.
team that originally worked to disarm Iraq _ that is, the new group
led by Hans Blix, former head of the International Atomic Energy
Agency and chairman of the new U.N. Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Simply discovering and destroying Iraq's biological, chemical
and nuclear capabilities is not enough to stop Iraq over the long
term if Iraq is able to simply rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   If inspectors return to Iraq, President Saddam Hussein is again
likely to refuse to cooperate, leaving the United States almost
alone in seeking punishment including military strikes.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, besides gaining the complicity of officials at
the United Nations, Iraq has also gained the tacit _ and at times
overt _ support of several major powers: notably Russia, China and
France.
</P>
<P>
   Even more dangerous, however, is the possibility that Saddam
WILL cooperate with the new inspectors. This would spell not only
an end to inspections but also an end of sanctions. And then Iraq
would be free to reconstitute its arms programs _ a clear and
present danger to the entire Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Surprising as it sounds, an impasse will better position the
United States to hamper Saddam's quest for weapons of mass
destruction _ and to avoid being a part of the deliberate flouting
of U.N. resolutions and arms-control agreements.
</P>
<P>
   In the final years of the U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM,
which was dispatched to disarm Iraq after the Persian Gulf war,
Saddam chose his provocations according to his own lights,
disrupting inspections or otherwise egregiously violating
agreements when he felt global support for his cause was strong or
when domestic concerns led him to pick a fight abroad.
</P>
<P>
   If the inspections resume, and Saddam picks a particularly
sensitive moment _ say, a setback in the Arab-Israeli peace process
or a burst of internal discontent in Saudi Arabia _ to be defiant,
the necessary diplomatic support for U.S.-led strikes to ensure
compliance may not be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Today's politicians and pundits who champion a resumption of
inspections say that, first, it will lead to the end of Iraq's
clandestine arms projects. Some inspections, they say, are better
than none and besides, it is impossible for Iraq to sustain an
impasse for very long. All three assumptions are false.
</P>
<P>
   The nominal success of inspections today would give Saddam a
free hand to develop bombs tomorrow. A new round of work would
probably not unearth much. U.N. workers would likely discover only
what Saddam wanted them to, or at best marginally improve our
knowledge of what is going on, leaving Iraq's existing lethal
capabilities untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is likely to again find itself in a nasty dilemma
comparable to what it faced on the eve of the Desert Fox airstrikes
in December 1998, when UNSCOM was finally withdrawn. The options:
Either ignore Saddam's deception and pave the way for declaring
Iraq free of weapons of mass destruction, or use force to demand
access.
</P>
<P>
   Past shows of force against Iraq, however, have brought at best
limited progress on disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   A more fundamental concern is that if Iraq were allowed to
forbid the conduct of ``any time, any place'' searches and instead
to control their timing and location, it could eventually get a
passing grade for disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam could then push to have Iraq certified as free of
nonconventional arms, which would end the sanctions that keep
Saddam in his box. Better an impasse than a sham.
</P>
<P>
   Before the invasion of Kuwait in 1990, the world knew little of
Iraq's efforts beyond the fact that it had a chemical-weapons
program _ used with gruesome effectiveness against its own Kurdish
population and against Iran during the eight-year war. Information
discovered after the Persian Gulf conflict indicated that Iraq was
close to producing a nuclear weapon and had vast stores of chemical
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the United States and its allies mistakenly believed
that Operation Desert Storm had destroyed much of Iraq's
threatening capability. As Defense Secretary Richard Cheney
testified in the immediate aftermath of Desert Storm, ``Saddam
Hussein is out of the nuclear business.''
</P>
<P>
   But Iraq's arsenal proved far more extensive than Western
leaders initially suspected _ and the job for inspectors more
onerous too.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Saddam blocked the inspectors' access, lied to
them about the existence of his deadly weapons programs and
otherwise made a mockery of the whole system. Iraqis repeatedly
stopped the U.N. team at the door and simply moved any sensitive
documents out the rear exit.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's interference was hardly subtle, and its pretexts for
noncompliance were often pathetic. But except for the United States
and Britain, the major powers would not back up the beleaguered
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the work was going full-bore, its effectiveness was
limited. Finding hidden weapons in a vast area is exceptionally
difficult, particularly biological weapons, which require
relatively limited infrastructure and can be easily concealed as
legitimate medical or research facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the U.N. inspectors were never led to a real
success: a complete accounting of Iraq's secret programs and the
destruction of all its proscribed weaponry. Baghdad revealed almost
none of its activities willingly and often lied about destroying
parts of its arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   The full extent of Iraq's biological weapons effort became clear
only after the August 1995 defection of Hussein Kamel al-Majid, a
former general and son-in-law of Saddam who had headed the
clandestine weapons projects. Likewise, the defection of Wafiq
al-Samarrai, the former chief of military intelligence, led to the
revelation that Iraq had manufactured and loaded onto delivery
systems the lethal chemical agent VX _ a surprise to UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq almost certainly still has a small stockpile of chemical
weapons and limited quantities of biological agents and seed stock.
Yet Iraq implausibly insists that its nonconventional weapons
programs have been terminated and therefore demands that sanctions
be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Although assessments vary, Iraq would probably need only a few
years to build a nuclear weapon after sanctions were lifted. Its
biological programs could be resumed in a matter of days. Producing
chemical agents such as mustard gas and sarin would take only a few
months.
</P>
<P>
   So not only sanctions but also strict controls over Iraqi
imports are still crucial to stop proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions have cut Iraqi state revenues by $10 billion to $15
billion a year, slashing the regime's assets. Equally important,
sanctions have sharply restricted what Iraq can buy. If Iraq cannot
acquire dual-use items that can be used for both weapons and
legitimate civilian purposes, developing weapons of mass
destruction will be far harder. An Iraq that can trade as a
``normal'' nation is an unnerving prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Russia is an aggressive advocate of Iraq's cause and a
full-throated critic of inspections and sanctions. France and China
also oppose U.S. policy and _ except for a handful of traumatized
gulf emirates, especially Kuwait _ the Arab states often hesitate
to support U.S. strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatically, it would be difficult and, indeed, foolish for
Washington to openly oppose renewed inspections. But U.S.
policy-makers should recognize that compromises, which offer the
false promise of progress, will in fact lay the groundwork for Iraq
to go its own way.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam has spent what limited money he controls on the tools of
war and on lavish rewards for his loyal followers, not on the
well-being of the Iraqi people. Money earmarked for humanitarian
purposes often goes unspent. The regime smuggles humanitarian goods
out of Iraq to sell on the black market. And Iraqis living in the
parts of northern Iraq under U.N. control fare far better than
those under Saddam's political thumb.
</P>
<P>
   If sanctions were lifted, there is little reason to expect that
Saddam would start spending revenue generously on the Iraqi people
and every reason to believe he would blow it on Iraq's lethal toys.
</P>
<P>
   To counter legitimate humanitarian concerns about the harm done
by halting the transfer of some dual-use items _ such as chlorine,
which can be used for both chemical weapons and water purification
_ Washington should push for more international supervision of
Iraqi imports. If the world community can confidently purchase,
transfer and install water-treatment facilities without worrying
that Iraq will divert them for military uses, it could send the
requisite dual-use items.
</P>
<P>
   Such humanitarian acts, however, require that control remain in
international hands lest Saddam's goons swipe the technology. Iraq,
not the United States, is the main barrier to such a shift.
</P>
<P>
   In a wider sense, however, the stumbling blocks in this
diplomatic dance lie not with Iraq but with the U.S. allies and
other major powers who are so anxious to resume trade with Baghdad.
Indeed, America's greatest obstacles are the efforts by France,
Russia and other defenders to readmit Iraq into the community of
nations without requiring it to adhere to international norms.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, standing alone may be self-defeating, despite its
moral attractiveness. But the perfect should not become the enemy
of the good. Renewed inspections would, however unwittingly, help
Saddam develop his weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing inspections may require Washington to stake out some
unpopular diplomatic positions, but given the stakes involved, the
danger of offending Saddam's defenders is easily worth the risk.

<P>
   The return of U.N. arms inspectors to Iraq would do more harm
than good.
</P>
<P>
   This is true no matter how robust is the successor to the U.N.
team that originally worked to disarm Iraq _ that is, the new group
led by Hans Blix, former head of the International Atomic Energy
Agency and chairman of the new U.N. Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Simply discovering and destroying Iraq's biological, chemical
and nuclear capabilities is not enough to stop Iraq over the long
term if Iraq is able to simply rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   If inspectors return to Iraq, President Saddam Hussein is again
likely to refuse to cooperate, leaving the United States almost
alone in seeking punishment including military strikes.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, besides gaining the complicity of officials at
the United Nations, Iraq has also gained the tacit _ and at times
overt _ support of several major powers: notably Russia, China and
France.
</P>
<P>
   Even more dangerous, however, is the possibility that Saddam
WILL cooperate with the new inspectors. This would spell not only
an end to inspections but also an end of sanctions. And then Iraq
would be free to reconstitute its arms programs _ a clear and
present danger to the entire Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Surprising as it sounds, an impasse will better position the
United States to hamper Saddam's quest for weapons of mass
destruction _ and to avoid being a part of the deliberate flouting
of U.N. resolutions and arms-control agreements.
</P>
<P>
   In the final years of the U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM,
which was dispatched to disarm Iraq after the Persian Gulf war,
Saddam chose his provocations according to his own lights,
disrupting inspections or otherwise egregiously violating
agreements when he felt global support for his cause was strong or
when domestic concerns led him to pick a fight abroad.
</P>
<P>
   If the inspections resume, and Saddam picks a particularly
sensitive moment _ say, a setback in the Arab-Israeli peace process
or a burst of internal discontent in Saudi Arabia _ to be defiant,
the necessary diplomatic support for U.S.-led strikes to ensure
compliance may not be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Today's politicians and pundits who champion a resumption of
inspections say that, first, it will lead to the end of Iraq's
clandestine arms projects. Some inspections, they say, are better
than none and besides, it is impossible for Iraq to sustain an
impasse for very long. All three assumptions are false.
</P>
<P>
   The nominal success of inspections today would give Saddam a
free hand to develop bombs tomorrow. A new round of work would
probably not unearth much. U.N. workers would likely discover only
what Saddam wanted them to, or at best marginally improve our
knowledge of what is going on, leaving Iraq's existing lethal
capabilities untouched.

 &HT;    MCCAIN NEEDS HUGE TURNOUT FOR 'FIGHTING CHANCE,' POLLSTER SAYS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John McCain's pollster said Friday that between
450,000 to 500,000 voters would have to turn out Saturday if the
Arizona senator were to have ``a fighting chance'' of winning the
South Carolina Republican presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill McInturff discounted predictions that the vote totals
could climb even higher than that in the widely watched showdown
between McCain and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe we're going to have 800,000 votes as has been
reported on CNN,'' McInturff told reporters at a breakfast meeting.
``On the other hand,'' he added, ``we've never had a South Carolina
primary of this magnitude where candidates have spent so much
money.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that four years ago, only 276,000 people, about 10
percent of those eligible, voted in the Republican contest between
then Sen. Bob Dole and Pat Buchanan, his insurgent challenger.
President Clinton had no Democratic opponent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Independent pollster John Zogby predicted that the turnout would
exceed 400,000. He noted that ``the real story here is that one in
three Republicans still support McCain, even with Bush's money and
Bush's (conservative) strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of a statewide Democratic contest, McCain has
pinned his hopes on a heavy turnout among independents and
Democrats, two groups of voters that were instrumental to his wide
margin of victory in New Hampshire on Feb. 1
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina weather on Saturday was forecast to be cloudy and
warm.
</P>
<P>
   Four newly released South Carolina polls, taken within 48 hours
of the primary, all showed Bush ahead by anywhere from two to 12
percentage points. McInturff said the unusually wide range reveals
that ``something is going on, but we don't quite know what.''
</P>
<P>
   On another score, however, McInturff was sure of himself:
``There's no question that John has gotten as good a press coverage
as anyone could ask for in the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The Bush people are in full whine mode about this.
But you didn't hear us whining about Bush's enormous advantages,
such as his $70 million (campaign war chest) and his gubernatorial
endorsements. So to have the Bush campaign whine about our
advantage, after how they've treated the press for a year, seems to
me to be equally unattractive.''
</P>
<P>
   McInturff laid out what he called ``a possible happy scenario''
that has McCain winning ``by 10 votes at two in the morning.'' If
that happens, he forecast that he senator would go on to defeat
Bush in the equally open Michigan primary on Tuesday by six to nine
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor would then be 0 for 4 in contested races going
into California, Ohio and New York (primaries next month). And
that's not a good place to be,'' he said.

   OK, that's about as far down as Bill usually reads before
deciding to send out his special re-education squads. I think
something's going wrong with Windows 98, too, but nobody seems to
know what it is.
</P>
<P>
   I've had several letters from readers with similar problems.
Most report getting messages indicating system resources are
getting low, even though they have what they think is sufficient
memory. Sorry, but that memory has nothing to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``System resources'' is actually a special, fixed chunk of
memory Windows uses for interface stuff, like those task-bar
buttons. When a program needs to use an interface tool, it gobbles
up some of the resource memory. It's supposed to let go of that
memory when it's finished, but that doesn't always happen. Could be
the program was terminated before it got the chance, could be bad
programming, could be a lot of things. You run out of resources,
though, and you crash.
</P>
<P>
   All of these problems cropping up at once points to something
like a recent Windows update that everyone has installed, or maybe
a new program that a lot of us have loaded. See if you can find any
common denominator.
</P>
<P>
   Not that that will fix your problem. We're all in the same boat
here, waiting for somebody _ Microsoft or whoever _ to admit
there's a problem and fix it. You can keep checking the Windows
update site, but why don't you and everybody else experiencing this
problem report it to Microsoft?
</P>
<P>
   Go to support.microsoft.com/support/webresponse.asp and click on
``Submit a question using no-charge support.'' You'll have to get a
user ID and password, plus you'll be giving Big Brother Bill your
address and number, so if you feel squeamish, never mind.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also need your product identification number, so I hope
you're not using bootlegged copies of Windows like me. Uh, I mean
like some innocent people unknowingly do.
</P>
<P>
   And if anybody finds out what's causing this mess, please let me
know, I'm tired of crashing in the middle of an Unreal Tournament
death match.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have a cable modem, and tech support says I
have a dynamic IP address. I have read about cable modems making it
easy for hackers to enter your computer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hacked Off
</P>
<P>
   DEAR HACKED: First of all, tell that support guy he's an idiot.
Cable modems are supposed to give you a static, or unchanging, IP
address, your own unique spot on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Because your address never changes, a hacker would know exactly
where to look, assuming you're a worthy target. To see if you're at
risk, go to grc.com and look for Shields UP!, which will report any
vulnerabilities. You'll also find a good review of personal
firewall software, which keeps bad guys on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   (Dr. Emilio Bombay has a static IP address, a firewall and a
large mallet with your name on it, so go hack Yahoo! instead.

 &HT;    Are Islam and democracy compatible? Iran's parliamentary
election this Friday will not provide a definitive answer, but it
may provide some hints. It turns, in any event, on the issue of how
democratic an Islamist regime can be.
 &HT;    Iranians can elect, in a tolerably fair way, the representatives
they want; the question is how much authority and freedom their
system then allows these representatives.
 &HT;    Our conclusion is not much.
 &HT;    President Muhammad Khatami has succeeded in making the
theocratic state less restrictive. But a growing number of Iranians
_ the bold, the thoughtful, the young _ want an administration and
a judiciary that are free from clerical despotism. The turbaned are
finding it ever harder to slap these hungry reformers down.
 &HT;    Outside Iran, political Islam has long since lost the cohesive,
cataclysmic energy that the western world, perhaps wrongly,
detected in the years after Iran's 1979 revolution. It has not,
however, lost its power to alarm.
 &HT;    The concept of ``Islamic terrorism'' still chills people, in
Moscow these days as well as in New York. Christians in Nigeria's
Muslim states quail at the introduction of the sharia (religious
law). And most Arab countries are still so wary of political Islam
that they refuse to allow it any political license at all.
 &HT;    Secularists share a simple fear: they believe that once Islamist
politicians have got themselves into a position of control, they
will never let go.
 &HT;    The Islamists themselves feed that fear when they preach of
power coming from God, of religion and state being one, and the
separation of the two a secular aberration. But, so far, Iran is
the sole example of radical Islamists running anything like a
democracy.
 &HT;    With democratic reform strongly promoted in this election, and
with Iran's braver prelates now admitting publicly that political
power, even if divine in origin, belongs to the people, it is much
too soon to pronounce that the Iranian test case has proved
democracy and political Islam to be incompatible.
 &HT;    Alas, the Islamic world is not burdened with examples of good
government, let alone democracy. But religion is seldom the
culprit: look, rather, for cruel autocrats, corrupt feudal systems,
overbearing armies or any combination of the above.
 &HT;    Indonesia, the largest Muslim country, is now working its
difficult way through a bad inheritance, but its new,
democratically chosen president is an Islamist of welcome
moderation and its Islamic tradition has long been tolerant.
 &HT;    Pakistan, a state specifically designed for Muslims, is in a
poor way, but not on account of its religion.
 &HT;    Turkey would shine more convincingly as a democracy if its army
had not thrown out a government dominated by mild Islamists.
 &HT;    The scene darkens as one moves west, with the Arabs inhabiting
the least democratic patch on God's earth. Most Arab rulers, be
they kings or presidents, take all the decisions that matter; their
minions then carry them out.
 &HT;    If they cannot claim a crown, they are reelected through
soft-flowing referendums. Arab ruling parties, with cash and
patronage in their gift, can usually win without cheating, though
to be safe they usually cheat too. Religion is largely irrelevant
to this common misbehavior.
 &HT;    Adherence to an austere, even cruel, form of Islamic law puts
Saudi Arabia at the bottom of most tourists' wish-lists. But it is
its feudal ruling family, not Islamic precept, that bars even the
pretense of democracy.
 &HT;    Syria's President Hafez Assad, having rid himself of the
Islamist ``threat'' by murdering many thousands at Hama in 1982,
rules as an undisputed despot who intends, in feudal fashion, to
pass the job on to his son.
 &HT;    Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak, who let his Islamists live, but
then had to fight the movement's armed wing, now locks up civilian
Islamists to prevent them from taking part in politics.
 &HT;    Algeria's army preceded Turkey's in pushing Islamists out of
power, but in a manner that led to a savage eight-year civil war in
the 1990s.
 &HT;    There are exceptions, of course, when Islamism itself is a
principal villain. In Sudan, an unrelenting Islamist government in
a religiously divided country has exacerbated a painfully long
civil war.
 &HT;    And the Taliban has enforced a primitive form of Islam on
Afghanistan that has had the Iranians, as well as everybody else,
in shock.
 &HT;    Making matters worse, both regimes have trained and been host to
the bands of roving mercenaries who keep alive the fear of Islamic
terrorism. 
  
 &HT;     (200-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 750)  
  
 &HT;    The West has paternity rights to these terrorists, claims
Russia, which says _ perhaps disingenuously _ that it was Islamist
allies of the Chechens who blew up blocks of apartment buildings in
Moscow last year.
 &HT;    But Russia is correct about the paternity. In the 1980s,
America, with Pakistan, financed, trained and equipped some 50,000
volunteers, mainly Arab, to fight the Soviet occupation of
Afghanistan.
 &HT;    When the Afghan war was won, the volunteers dispersed, looking
for ways to practice the only skill they knew. One of them, Osama
bin Laden, turned against America during the war with Iraq.
 &HT;    A rich and clever Saudi, bin Laden at one time ran a lethal
network. He has now, it seems, been contained, a liability to the
Taliban regime that may well eventually hand him over in exchange
for international respectability.
 &HT;    But there are many other ``Afghanis,'' capable of individual
acts of great evil. 
  
 &HT;     (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,050)  
  
 &HT;    The actions of a few zealots have helped to discolor
understanding of political Islam. The importance of the movement,
these days, is not what it can achieve in the political field, and
even less what it can do with its bombs. It is rather its mole-like
incursions into ordinary life.
 &HT;    In many Muslim countries, particularly in the Middle East,
people are behaving, or finding themselves obliged to behave, in a
stricter Islamic manner.
 &HT;    Suddenly, there are more curbs on what they can read, or how
they can entertain themselves. Women, not always unwillingly, are
having to cover up.
 &HT;    The happy exception to this trend is Islamist Iran. Here, people
are beginning to find that they can burst out of old restrictions,
not enter into new ones.
 &HT;    Political Islam still provides dangers, but it also provides
reasons for hope.

<P>
   Are Islam and democracy compatible? Iran's parliamentary
election this Friday will not provide a definitive answer, but it
may provide some hints. It turns, in any event, on the issue of how
democratic an Islamist regime can be.
</P>
<P>
   Iranians can elect, in a tolerably fair way, the representatives
they want; the question is how much authority and freedom their
system then allows these representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Our conclusion is not much.
</P>
<P>
   President Muhammad Khatami has succeeded in making the
theocratic state less restrictive. But a growing number of Iranians
_ the bold, the thoughtful, the young _ want an administration and
a judiciary that are free from clerical despotism. The turbaned are
finding it ever harder to slap these hungry reformers down.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Iran, political Islam has long since lost the cohesive,
cataclysmic energy that the western world, perhaps wrongly,
detected in the years after Iran's 1979 revolution. It has not,
however, lost its power to alarm.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of ``Islamic terrorism'' still chills people, in
Moscow these days as well as in New York. Christians in Nigeria's
Muslim states quail at the introduction of the sharia (religious
law). And most Arab countries are still so wary of political Islam
that they refuse to allow it any political license at all.
</P>
<P>
   Secularists share a simple fear: they believe that once Islamist
politicians have got themselves into a position of control, they
will never let go.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamists themselves feed that fear when they preach of
power coming from God, of religion and state being one, and the
separation of the two a secular aberration. But, so far, Iran is
the sole example of radical Islamists running anything like a
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   With democratic reform strongly promoted in this election, and
with Iran's braver prelates now admitting publicly that political
power, even if divine in origin, belongs to the people, it is much
too soon to pronounce that the Iranian test case has proved
democracy and political Islam to be incompatible.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the Islamic world is not burdened with examples of good
government, let alone democracy. But religion is seldom the
culprit: look, rather, for cruel autocrats, corrupt feudal systems,
overbearing armies or any combination of the above.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia, the largest Muslim country, is now working its
difficult way through a bad inheritance, but its new,
democratically chosen president is an Islamist of welcome
moderation and its Islamic tradition has long been tolerant.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan, a state specifically designed for Muslims, is in a
poor way, but not on account of its religion.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey would shine more convincingly as a democracy if its army
had not thrown out a government dominated by mild Islamists.
</P>
<P>
   The scene darkens as one moves west, with the Arabs inhabiting
the least democratic patch on God's earth. Most Arab rulers, be
they kings or presidents, take all the decisions that matter; their
minions then carry them out.
</P>
<P>
   If they cannot claim a crown, they are reelected through
soft-flowing referendums. Arab ruling parties, with cash and
patronage in their gift, can usually win without cheating, though
to be safe they usually cheat too. Religion is largely irrelevant
to this common misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   Adherence to an austere, even cruel, form of Islamic law puts
Saudi Arabia at the bottom of most tourists' wish-lists. But it is
its feudal ruling family, not Islamic precept, that bars even the
pretense of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's President Hafez Assad, having rid himself of the
Islamist ``threat'' by murdering many thousands at Hama in 1982,
rules as an undisputed despot who intends, in feudal fashion, to
pass the job on to his son.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak, who let his Islamists live, but
then had to fight the movement's armed wing, now locks up civilian
Islamists to prevent them from taking part in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Algeria's army preceded Turkey's in pushing Islamists out of
power, but in a manner that led to a savage eight-year civil war in
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   There are exceptions, of course, when Islamism itself is a
principal villain. In Sudan, an unrelenting Islamist government in
a religiously divided country has exacerbated a painfully long
civil war.
</P>
<P>
   And the Taliban has enforced a primitive form of Islam on
Afghanistan that has had the Iranians, as well as everybody else,
in shock.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse, both regimes have trained and been host to
the bands of roving mercenaries who keep alive the fear of Islamic
terrorism. &QL;

<P>
   The leader has gone, for the good of the party, and it seems
churlish not to applaud and say, ``Well done, Wolfgang Schauble. By
falling on your sword, you have done the noble thing and now we can
put all this behind us and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the words do not come easily. A feeling persists that this
is the wrong leader, resigning for the wrong reason, and that it is
too soon to bring down the curtain on the German Christian
Democrats' financial scandals and all their ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   The whiff of something rotten is still in the air and, until its
source is fully exposed and dealt with, it will continue to
contaminate the Christian Democrats, and maybe others too.
</P>
<P>
   The man who could do most to help, and therefore the man who
should have been humbling himself this week, is Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
   It was he, by his own admission, who accepted illegal
contributions to his party's funds, yet he defiantly still refuses
to name the donors.
</P>
<P>
   Schauble has reason to be embarrassed too: among other things,
he admits he took a handsome cash donation from an arms dealer.
This was certainly an error of judgment, but a legal one, it seems,
not in itself a resigning matter.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the feeling that Schauble, variously Kohl's protege, loyal
supporter and faithful successor, has now become his proxy and his
fall guy.
</P>
<P>
   As for the reason for resigning, it is not any admission of
guilt for misdeeds, or even errors of judgment. No, it is to allow
the party to make a new beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Not, of course, that this is for Schauble a narrow partisan
matter. Rather it is for the sake of Germany: it is of ``supreme
importance'' that the Christian Democrats remain a strong force for
integration in the political center if the crisis in the party is
not to become ``a crisis of our democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This goal must come above all else,'' said the departing
leader. Bunkum. Democracies need honest parties, parties that admit
their mistakes and purge their rotten elements, more than they need
forces for integration in the political center.
</P>
<P>
   A rotten Christian Democratic Union (CDU) will do nothing to
serve democracy. Nor, moreover, will it be a force for integration.
The voters will mistrust it and turn elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   If they sense that the other mainstream parties are decent and
honest, they will give them their support. If not, they will stay
at home _ or look to the extremes. That is exactly what Schauble
says he wants to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Germans are in a censorious mood these days _ look at their
unforgiving criticisms of the apparently minor infractions of
leading Social Democrats, such as Johannes Rau _ but they are not
turning to the extremes, not yet anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Before they resort to that, they have other possibilities to
explore. One is the party of Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, the
Social Democrats, who may yet emerge looking reasonably clean from
the intensive scandal-searching now going on.
</P>
<P>
   Another is their partner in government, the Greens, in secular
decline, it seems, but no longer barmy in their policies. On the
contrary, on economic policy the Greens often make more sense than
the Social Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the Free Democrats, Germany's liberals. They
are centrists, for whom the tribulations of the Christian Democrats
provide a historic opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Were they to espouse liberal social policies to match the
economic ones they have long advocated, they could expand their
popular appeal and thus escape from their traditional role as
coalition counterweights to become a mass party in their own right.
At any rate they could hope to.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, however, that German democracy is not yet at
stake; the fate of the Christian Democrats may be. Here Schauble is
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CDU is in the worst crisis in its history,'' he said this
week. What he did not say was that, if his successor is to get the
party out of its crisis, he _ or more likely she _ will have to
persuade the party's grand old man, Kohl, and all those around him
at the end of his 25-year reign as party chairman, to come clean
about what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   Only then will the voters be prepared to put their trust, once
again, in the CDU. The good news, however, is that in the meantime
German democracy will probably survive.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Money can't buy friends, but you can get a better class of
enemy,'' Spike Milligan, a British comedian, once opined.
</P>
<P>
   Without money, much economic activity would grind to a halt. But
what is money? Over the centuries, many things have served the
purpose, from beads to cowrie shells to pigs. More recently people
have found notes and coins rather easier to carry around.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, however, notes and coins could go the same way as pigs, to
be replaced by electronic digits that transfer value at the click
of a mouse _ or so digital enthusiasts would have us believe.
</P>
<P>
   They may be right: but don't bet your last dollar bill on it.
</P>
<P>
   Futurologists have predicted a cashless society ever since the
invention of ``plastic money.'' It is exactly 50 years since Diners
Club introduced the world's first charge card.
</P>
<P>
   Credit cards, which followed slightly later, took a long time to
catch on, but now, as Alan Greenspan, chairman of America's Federal
Reserve, recently joked, ``children, dogs, cats and moose are
getting credit cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet people seem unaccountably fond of cash. In America, Germany
and Japan the value of notes and coins in circulation has risen
faster than the value of GDP over the past 30 years. This implies
that the average person is carrying more, not less, cash than he
used to.
</P>
<P>
   Why is this? Part of the answer is that a growing chunk of
American and German bank notes circulate outside these countries,
in such places as Russia where the local currency is not trusted.
However, foreign holdings of yen are relatively small.
</P>
<P>
   A second explanation is that tax evasion and illegal activities
such as drug trafficking, conducted in cash, have increased.
</P>
<P>
   A third, more prosaic reason is that an expansion in the number
of cash machines has increased the convenience of using the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 2,500 years of existence, cash may be looking a
bit long in the tooth for today's ``new economy.'' But the truth is
that it is still ideally suited to many everyday purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Could e-cash become a serious rival? With a prepaid card, where
money is stored on a computer chip, you need never be short of the
right change for a ticket machine or parking meter.
</P>
<P>
   And the explosion in Internet commerce could give a boost to
privately issued digital cash that can be used to make payments
over computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   The elimination of many physical cash transactions is certainly
technically feasible, and e-cash plans are proliferating. But there
are still big barriers to a cashless society.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing can ever be as liquid as notes and coins, which, as
legal tender, are acceptable as payment everywhere; digital cash is

of traditional, anonymous cash if they could, precisely in order to
reduce the opportunities for tax evasion and crime. They would do
better to tackle such problems at source, by reducing the

</P>
<P>
   If cash provides a safety value that makes it possible for some
firms to escape overly burdensome taxes and regulations, long live
cash. Money may be able to buy a better class of enemy, but
remember that the enemy of oppressive governments is often the
friend of the people. &QL;

&HT;     YOUNG GIRLS GETTING A LESSON IN BEING LADIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Feb. 20)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CELINA OTTAWAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Lawyer, obstetrician, pediatrician _ the
ambitions fly around the table of eighth-grade girls as quickly as
you can ask, the legacy of the last century's feminist movement
evident in their sure voices.
</P>
<P>
   But listen closely and you can hear the future as well as the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a lady,'' said 14-year-old D'Amber Pounds, as her
friends Angelic Walters and Marissa Woods nodded in agreement. The
three girls are learning to be ladies as part of their training as
Archonettes _ a youth group run by Zeta Phi Beta, an Albany
sorority.
</P>
<P>
   To these young women there is no contradiction between
femininity and strength, between ambition and grace, between good
manners and getting ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Trend watchers, including high-fashion magazines, are hailing
the return of the lady. The idea is at once old-fashioned and
modern, a combination of traditional manners and career savvy.
</P>
<P>
   These modern ladies appear as stars on the fashion pages _
socialites talking about their careers as doctors and the balls
they attend. And in the Pine Hills branch of the Albany Public
Library, where Zeta Phi Beta sorority sisters teach young women to
balance budgets, become financially independent and stop cursing.
</P>
<P>
   It is a simple four-letter word: lady. But to some, the word
conveys a powerful and dangerous idea that women should approach
with caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know from my experiences as a historian that `unladylike' is
one of the most powerful terms used to denigrate women who are
working for change,'' said Rebecca Edwards, an assistant professor
of history at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. ``I love Miss
Manners and I think we should all send thank-you notes, but the
term `lady' has been used historically in ways that are racially
exclusive, economically exclusive and in ways that block women's
full exploration of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Conduct writers of the 18th century, such as James Fordyce and
John Gregory, set out to define an upper-class notion of femininity
in precise terms.
</P>
<P>
   Single ladies weren't allowed to be alone in a room with a man
for more than 15 minutes. They had to speak softly. Blushing was
considered to be a sign of modesty _ women who couldn't blush were
suspect as fallen women.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Richardson, an influential 18th-century author, wrote the
following in a letter to a Lady Bradshaigh: ``Man is an animal that
must bustle in the world ... Bravery, anger, fierceness,
occasionally are made familiar to them. They buffet, and are
buffeted by the world; are impatient and uncontrollable ... While
women are meek, passive, good creatures, who (are) used to
stay(ing) at home ... get their houses in order to receive,
comfort, oblige, give joy to, their fierce, fighting, bustling,
active protectors, providers, maintainers.''
</P>
<P>
   Women have been resisting such ideas _ and the notion of lady _
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   In 1792, Mary Wollstonecraft, an ancestor of modern feminism,
wrote a book attacking the idea that women are passive and
decorative. She encouraged women to devote themselves to
self-improvement, get jobs and be physically strong.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century, suffragists were attacked as being
unladylike, said Edwards. As were women advocating for equal rights
in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feminists were classified as bra-burners,'' Edwards said.
``All of that comes down to being unladylike.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a legacy that mothers must confront as they decide how
raise their daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Paige Salvador is 38. She worked in the corporate world for 11
years before deciding to stay home full time and raise her twins, a
boy and a girl. Now that her daughter, Shaine, is 5, Salvador is
mindful of the type of woman the girl will become.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if girls want to be typically female, it's OK,''
Salvador said. ``I think that if parents try to homogenize or blend
boys and girls you are going to lose something. But, and there is a
big but on this, I believe that if you follow this philosophy there
is a big price to pay for women.''
</P>
<P>
   Men and women, Salvador said, speak different languages and play
by different rules. In order to be successful women have to know
how to play by men's rules, she said. If being ladylike is seen as
being passive, it can hurt a woman's chances of promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If girls are socialized to act in a way society believes to be
typically feminine or typically girl-like, they seem to pay a price
in the workplace, in the political arena and sometimes as a
mother,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Manners are important for children of both sexes to learn, said
Salvador, who has taught etiquette classes. But she is conscious of
the potential conflict between her ideals of equality and even
basic male/female etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I want my daughter's boyfriends to open doors for her,''
she said. ``But that doesn't mean she can't run a corporation.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ladylike behavior is something best taught by modeling rather
than preaching, said Jannette Rondo, president of the local
graduate chapter of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clothes that you wear,'' said Rondo. ``There are young
ladies who go out barely wearing clothes. You have to think about
the message you're sending. ... We don't want them looking like
hoochie mamas. We want them to learn that they are not objects to
be looked at. They should be looked at for who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Archonettes dress in business attire for their monthly meetings.
Members learn how to conduct a meeting using Robert's Rules of
Order, manage their money, plan events and settle disputes through
dialogue _ all qualities of a modern lady, according to Rondo.
</P>
<P>
   How to entertain a man and other husband-catching techniques are
not included in the instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that we are anti-men,'' said Rondo. ``There is nothing
wrong with marriage, but that's not our emphasis.''
</P>
<P>
   Ladylike behavior comes out of respect for one's self, said
Rondo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't put books on their heads and tell them to walk in a
straight manner,'' she said. ``Once they learn to respect
themselves as young ladies and know that they are beautiful no
matter what shape they are, they are floating on air. It comes from
that.''

   ``Money can't buy friends, but you can get a better class of
enemy,'' Spike Milligan, a British comedian, once opined.
</P>
<P>
   Without money, much economic activity would grind to a halt. But
what is money? Over the centuries, many things have served the
purpose, from beads to cowrie shells to pigs. More recently people
have found notes and coins rather easier to carry around.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, however, notes and coins could go the same way as pigs, to
be replaced by electronic digits that transfer value at the click
of a mouse _ or so digital enthusiasts would have us believe.
</P>
<P>
   They may be right: but don't bet your last dollar bill on it.
</P>
<P>
   Futurologists have predicted a cashless society ever since the
invention of ``plastic money.'' It is exactly 50 years since Diners
Club introduced the world's first charge card.
</P>
<P>
   Credit cards, which followed slightly later, took a long time to
catch on, but now, as Alan Greenspan, chairman of America's Federal
Reserve, recently joked, ``children, dogs, cats and moose are
getting credit cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet people seem unaccountably fond of cash. In America, Germany
and Japan the value of notes and coins in circulation has risen
faster than the value of GDP over the past 30 years. This implies
that the average person is carrying more, not less, cash than he
used to.
</P>
<P>
   Why is this? Part of the answer is that a growing chunk of
American and German bank notes circulate outside these countries,
in such places as Russia where the local currency is not trusted.
However, foreign holdings of yen are relatively small.
</P>
<P>
   A second explanation is that tax evasion and illegal activities
such as drug trafficking, conducted in cash, have increased.
</P>
<P>
   A third, more prosaic reason is that an expansion in the number
of cash machines has increased the convenience of using the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 2,500 years of existence, cash may be looking a
bit long in the tooth for today's ``new economy.'' But the truth is
that it is still ideally suited to many everyday purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Could e-cash become a serious rival? With a prepaid card, where
money is stored on a computer chip, you need never be short of the
right change for a ticket machine or parking meter.
</P>
<P>
   And the explosion in Internet commerce could give a boost to
privately issued digital cash that can be used to make payments
over computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   The elimination of many physical cash transactions is certainly
technically feasible, and e-cash plans are proliferating. But there
are still big barriers to a cashless society.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing can ever be as liquid as notes and coins, which, as
legal tender, are acceptable as payment everywhere; digital cash is
unlikely ever to match cash for ubiquity.
</P>
<P>
   An even bigger problem with most e-cash systems is that they
allow governments or firms to snoop on your spending habits. It is
not only criminals that might wish to avoid that.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob Dole may have been one of America's more dismal presidential
candidates. But when it comes to tart political observations he
remains a class act.
</P>
<P>
   He recently told a television audience that the reason he had a
Band-Aid on his thumb was that he had pricked himself in his rush
to replace his Bush button with a McCain one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't find a McCain button on anybody yesterday,'' he
noted, ``but today they're all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite all over the place. There are precious few
McCain badges on the lapels of Dole's old friends at the heart of
the Republican establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most powerful Republicans on Capitol Hill _ notably
Trent Lott, Mitch McConnell and Orrin Hatch in the Senate, and Tom
DeLay in the House _ would rather turn vegetarian than support
Senator McCain.
</P>
<P>
   And even Republicans who confess to liking the senator
personally can be ferociously critical of his political skills,
arguing that he is more interested in winning cheap publicity than
in the painstaking business of passing laws.
</P>
<P>
   Only four of his fellow senators have so far endorsed McCain.
Yet 39 senators, 175 congressmen and umpteen governors have
endorsed George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   There is even more hostility to McCain in the bizarre collection
of think-tanks and religious groups that dominates the party's
conservative wing.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Feulner, the head of the Heritage Foundation, has lamented
that McCain's agenda is simply not conservative; Pat Robertson has
urged social conservatives to leave the party in droves if McCain
is the party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   And the National Right to Life Committee has littered South
Carolina with leaflets saying that McCain ``voted repeatedly to use
tax dollars for experiments that use body parts from aborted
babies.''
</P>
<P>
   The explanation for all this hostility is simple: McCain
represents a gigantic threat to the way the establishment does
business. At the very least, his campaign against the ``iron
triangle'' of ``lobbyists, big money and legislation'' is going to
change the way that Washington works.
</P>
<P>
   It could well end up altering the balance of power in all sorts
of unforeseen ways, perhaps even playing into the hands of the
Democrats, with their lock on union dues and their automatic
support from feminists and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my best friend,'' says Phil Gramm, who enlisted McCain to
run his campaign for the presidency in 1996. ``But his views on
campaign-finance reform would make us the minority party for 25
years.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain adds to his unpopularity by personalizing his crusade,
employing a staff man to sniff out his colleagues' pork and then
exposing it for all to see on his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   He has accused McConnell of cuddling up to tobacco interests,
Lott of throwing public money at a local shipyard and Robert
Bennett of helping to get $2.2 million to repair sewers in Utah in
return for contributions, a charge Bennett vigorously denies.
</P>
<P>
   His indifference to the formalities of Senate life grates with
many of his colleagues, particularly when he dismisses their
remarks as ``chicken(feces).''
</P>
<P>
   The other thing that leaves Republicans foaming is their belief
that McCain is a hypocrite, preaching about cleansing the Augean
stables but then rolling in the muck himself.
</P>
<P>
   He takes political contributions from Microsoft, Viacom, Bell
South and US West, all companies that must at some point have
business before his Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He flies on corporate jets. He recently held a
$500-to-$1,000-a-plate ``Straight Talk dinner'' in Washington,
complete with some of the iron triangle's most famous lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   So how much has the radical McCain to fear from his party's
establishment?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody can emerge wholly undamaged from the sort of attack ads
that are being aired in South Carolina and Michigan. But McCain has
a chance of emerging less damaged than most.
</P>
<P>
   The more the establishment rails against him, the more it
reinforces his reputation as an outsider. And the lower it sinks in
the use of dirty tactics such as ``push polling'' (pretending to
conduct a telephone opinion poll while really besmirching one of
the candidates), the more it demonstrates that the political system
needs a thorough cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is a limit to how long the establishment will
keep up its hostility. Trent Lott and Pat Robertson may never
relent, but most Republicans supported Bush only because he looked
like a winner, and they may soon uncover a secret love for
campaign-finance reform if McCain can capture that mantle.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, the former candidate of the Christian right, and
Bill Jones, the highest Republican elected official in California,
have both endorsed McCain in recent days, and Republican moneymen
have started cutting their losses by ``dutching'' a little money on
the man from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain is shoving the Republican establishment into doing
rather more than just diversify its risks. The establishment
embraced Bush because he seemed to promise an easy chance of
rehabilitating itself after a disastrous few years when it had been
outfoxed by Bill Clinton and led up the garden path by Newt
Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Bush came from the respected ranks of Republican governors
rather than the despised ranks of Washington insiders. He belonged
to one of the party's most respected families. And he had dreamed
up a concoction _ ``compassionate conservatism'' _ which promised
to bring new groups of people into a party that seems to have hit a
ceiling of 42 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has all but killed this Whiggish dream of change without
revolution. He has exposed the party's deepest divisions, forced
Bush to pander to its most Neanderthal elements, and rendered
``compassionate conservatism'' all but irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's most reflective supporters argue that this is all for
the best, provided the insurgency gathers pace.
</P>
<P>
   The establishment periodically loses touch with the rest of the
country, they say, gripped by unpopular ideas, corrupted by
corporate money and just plain complacent, and the only solution is
an internal revolution. This happened with Ronald Reagan in the
late 1970s and then again, rather less triumphantly, with Gingrich
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   This may well be right. But the establishment Republicans' worry
is that McCain will provide enough of a shock to traumatize their
preferred candidate but not enough to revitalize their ailing
party. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob Dole may have been one of America's more dismal presidential
candidates. But when it comes to tart political observations he
remains a class act.
</P>
<P>
   He recently told a television audience that the reason he had a
Band-Aid on his thumb was that he had pricked himself in his rush
to replace his Bush button with a McCain one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't find a McCain button on anybody yesterday,'' he
noted, ``but today they're all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite all over the place. There are precious few
McCain badges on the lapels of Dole's old friends at the heart of
the Republican establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most powerful Republicans on Capitol Hill _ notably
Trent Lott, Mitch McConnell and Orrin Hatch in the Senate, and Tom
DeLay in the House _ would rather turn vegetarian than support
Senator McCain.
</P>
<P>
   And even Republicans who confess to liking the senator
personally can be ferociously critical of his political skills,
arguing that he is more interested in winning cheap publicity than
in the painstaking business of passing laws.
</P>
<P>
   Only four of his fellow senators have so far endorsed McCain.
Yet 39 senators, 175 congressmen and umpteen governors have
endorsed George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   There is even more hostility to McCain in the bizarre collection
of think-tanks and religious groups that dominates the party's
conservative wing.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Feulner, the head of the Heritage Foundation, has lamented
that McCain's agenda is simply not conservative; Pat Robertson has
urged social conservatives to leave the party in droves if McCain
is the party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   And the National Right to Life Committee has littered South
Carolina with leaflets saying that McCain ``voted repeatedly to use
tax dollars for experiments that use body parts from aborted
babies.''
</P>
<P>
   The explanation for all this hostility is simple: McCain
represents a gigantic threat to the way the establishment does
business. At the very least,hington works.
</P>
<P>
   It could well end up altering the balance of power in all sorts
of unforeseen ways, perhaps even playing into the hands of the
Democrats, with their lock on union dues and their automatic
support from feminists and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my best friend,'' says Phil Gramm, who enlisted McCain to
run his campaign for the presidency in 1996. ``But his views on
campaign-finance reform would make us the minority party for 25
years.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain adds to his unpopularity by personalizing his crusade,
employing a staff man to sniff out his colleagues' pork and then
exposing it for all to see on his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   He has accused McConnell of cuddling up to tobacco interests,
Lott of throwing public money at a local shipyard and Robert
Bennett of helping to get $2.2 million to repair sewers in Utah in
return for contributions, a charge Bennett vigorously denies.
</P>
<P>

&HT;     `SOPRANOS': AS GOOD AS IT GETS ON TV 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (EDS: SUBS hed to correct)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TIM GOODMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no legislating opinion, so there's no point in telling
people who don't like ``The Sopranos'' that they are wrong. It's
perfectly acceptable _ even expected _ for people to dislike the
HBO show.
</P>
<P>
   If you fall in the ranks of the disappointed or the unimpressed,
consider this: ``The Sopranos'' is breaking conventional television
constraints every week, often so subtly it goes unnoticed, and
unappreciated.
</P>
<P>
   American television viewers have been conditioned through the
years to reject gray for black and white, a delicate touch for the
anvil. And we're not talking here about ``WWF Smackdown!'' or
low-brow sitcoms. Shows that are considered our finest offerings _
``ER'' and ``NYPD Blue'' and ``The Practice'' _ are rife with
crowd-pleasing theatrics and predictable structure, easily grasped
moments and a creative conservatism masquerading as something fresh
and challenging.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't make them bad, or unenjoyable. But they're
pandering.
</P>
<P>
   Those show are remarkable mostly for finding a formula several
notches above a more obvious, easily dismissed formula that we've
come to expect from Hollywood. That they get ratings and have loyal
viewers is a wonderful thing.
</P>
<P>
   If ``The Sopranos'' played by those rules every week, guns would
be going off continuously, there would be a lot more Big Moments,
and a good deal more tears and staged drama. Luckily, creator David
Chase and his stable of writers and actors have chosen a different
path. And that's why ``The Sopranos'' is the best show on
television, period.
</P>
<P>
   Even some staunch ``Sopranos'' fans thought the first episode
from season two was slow, uneven, or lacked impact. Compared to the
faux dramatic puppetry of ``ER'' and the ``Let's do something with
Sipowicz'' tendency of ``NYPD Blue,'' yeah, they're right. And
after the hallucinogenic glare of that off-season ``Sopranos''
hype, who could blame them for missing the difference between
brilliant and very good?
</P>
<P>
   Consider this: Chase could have started this second season by
blowing up Tony's house, having a turf war or having Tony and his
mother kiss and make up at her deathbed. But he didn't. He stayed
true to his method _ calmness amid potential chaos.
</P>
<P>
   No show on television has more silence than ``The Sopranos.''
Chase uses quiet moments like others use car wrecks. This is
essential to understanding the series. On network television, those
scenes would vanish. The formula calls for building up drama, or
laughs, right before a commercial break. It's like clockwork. It's
such an obvious treatment that, through years and years of watching
television, we're oblivious to it.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Sopranos'' flows differently. Think back two weeks
when Tony and his crew went to Italy. On a network, this would have
been blown out of proportion. ``Tony Soprano goes to Italy! A clash
of cultures!'' But that's not how Chase chose to play the episode.
A great deal of it, in fact, took place in Tony's head. How many
times did Tony look at someone _ the Mafia daughter running the
show over there, the aging Don, the culture itself _ and say
nothing?
</P>
<P>
   The camera lingered on him simply thinking.
</P>
<P>
   At its most basic, ``The Sopranos'' is a show about what is
going on in Tony Soprano's head. The series is fortunate to have
James Gandolfini bring to life a very complicated character. While
his rage is exciting to witness, his facial features are far more
revealing. Just a half-smile or smirk, a raised eyebrow, a
death-glare or that look of lost control is more effective than any
yelling or gun fire could ever be.
</P>
<P>
   That we don't appreciate this _ much less know what to do with
it _ says more about what television is doing to us as viewers, and
less about what ``The Sopranos'' is failing to do with the notion
of action and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   If you're taping ``The Sopranos,'' save an episode you thought
was boring, or lifeless. Take another look. Appreciate the little
things: like the characters have gained weight. No models here.
Look at the clothes they wear _ Jersey perfect. Just like Tony's
suburban house. Listen to the dialogue and pause on that moment
when one of them makes a casual aside. It probably reveals
something true about their character. And it would probably have
been cut from ``ER.'' Too slow.
</P>
<P>
   Some viewers respond best to the cool elements of the show. The
music. The dialogue. The deft use of dream sequences or tricky
camera moves. It's all good. But the greatness comes from the
acting and the tone, which are intertwined. The small, quiet,
seemingly inconsequential moments _ the long pauses or impotent
rage played out in silence _ those are the defining moments of the
series.
</P>
<P>
   As viewers, we have a hard time grasping the unspoken, the lack
of action. We feel lost in a scene that's not familiar, when we
can't predict where it's going or why it's taking place. Some
people may never appreciate the inside of Tony's head. But make no
mistake about it _ that's where the real action takes place.
</P>
<P>
   If Chase and Gandolfini and the writers and some of the other
actors deserve Emmys (and they do) for their contributions to ``The
Sopranos,'' then there ought to be some other kind of prize for
leading us down another path to enlightenment from our predictable,
formulaic TV ignorance. Backlash be damned.

<P>
   The explanation for all this hostility is simple: McCain
represents a gigantic threat to the way the establishment does
business. At the very least, his campaign against the ``iron
triangle'' of ``lobbyists, big money and legislation'' is going to
change the way that Washington works.
</P>
<P>
   It could well end up altering the balance of power in all sorts
of unforeseen ways, perhaps even playing into the hands of the

</P>
<P>
   The other thing that leaves Republicans foaming is their belief
that McCain is a hypocrite, preaching about cleansing the Augean

</P>
<P>
   He takes political contributions from Microsoft, Viacom, Bell
South and US West, all companies that must at some point have
business before his Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He flies on corporate jets. He recently held a
$500-to-$1,000-a-plate ``Straight Talk dinner'' in Washington,

</P>
<P>
   So how much has the radical McCain to fear from his party's

</P>
<P>
   Nobody can emerge wholly undamaged from the sort of attack ads

a chance of emerging less damaged than most.
</P>
<P>
   The more the establishment rails against him, the more it
reinforces his reputation as an outsider. And the lower it sinks in
the use of dirty tactics such as ``push polling'' (pretending to
conduct a telephone opinion poll while really besmirching one of
the candidates), the more it demonstrates that the political system
needs a thorough cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is a limit to how long the establishment will
keep up its hostility. Trent Lott and Pat Robertson may never
relent, but most Republicans supported Bush only because he looked
like a winner, and they may soon uncover a secret love for
campaign-finance reform if McCain can capture that mantle.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, the former candidate of the Christian right, and
Bill Jones, the highest Republican elected official in California,
have both endorsed McCain in recent days, and Republican moneymen
have started cutting their losses by ``dutching'' a little money on
the man from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain is shoving the Republican establishment into doing
rather more than just diversify its risks. The establishment
embraced Bush because he seemed to promise an easy chance of
rehabilitating itself after a disastrous few years when it had been
outfoxed by Bill Clinton and led up the garden path by Newt
Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Bush came from the respected ranks of Republican governors
rather than the despised ranks of Washington insiders. He belonged
to one of the party's most respected families. And he had dreamed
up a concoction _ ``compassionate conservatism'' _ which promised
to bring new groups of people into a party that seems to have hit a
ceiling of 42 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has all but killed this Whiggish dream of change without
revolution. He has exposed the party's deepest divisions, forced
Bush to pander to its most Neanderthal elements, and rendered
``compassionate conservatism'' all but irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's most reflective supporters argue that this is all for
the best, provided the insurgency gathers pace.
</P>
<P>
   The establishment periodically loses touch with the rest of the

corporate money and just plain complacent, and the only solution is
an internal revolution. This happened with Ronald Reagan in the
late 1970s and then again, rather less triumphantly, with Gingrich
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   This may well be right. But the establishment Republicans' worry
is that McCain will provide enough of a shock to traumatize their

party. &QL;

 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON AND NEW YORK _ It is, in some ways, the best of times for
the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet boom has boosted the Journal's advertising revenue
by 40 percent over last year; at the FT (part-owner of The
Economist) it is up around 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody wants ``brand'' and ``content,'' which both companies
have in spades; the share prices of the papers' parent companies,
Dow Jones and Pearson, have leapt.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is a worrying time, too. Both papers face new competition
_ from online services and from each other.
</P>
<P>
   Since the FT launched its American edition in September 1997,
circulation has jumped, reaching 102,000 in December 1999 _ not yet
a serious threat to the Journal's 1.7 million, but uncomfortable
for an incumbent whose circulation has slipped by 7 percent over a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Now Dow Jones is hitting back in the FT's own territory. Hence
the relaunch, earlier this month, of the Wall Street Journal
Europe, with more staff, more technology coverage and a less
archaic front page.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the FT's second strike: the launch, on Feb. 21, of FT
Deutschland, a German-language daily business newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson will not say how much this new venture is costing, but
100 new journalists (some of whom have left before the launch) do
not come cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   Running the paper as a joint venture with Gruner + Jahr,
Bertelsmann's magazine arm, offsets some risk; but joint ventures
bring their own problems.
</P>
<P>
   So why take the risk? Because Germany is Europe's biggest
market, which the FT, with a circulation there of 22,000, has
barely penetrated. And German business journalism is stodgy and
slow.
</P>
<P>
   When Oskar Lafontaine resigned as finance minister at 6 p.m.,
the German papers scraped a mention, while the FT had the full
story.
</P>
<P>
   But now the Journal has weighed in with the competition.
Handelsblatt, Germany's main business daily, has a Journal editor
in its offices, and is using Journal copy. The front article is
already livelier.
</P>
<P>
   But the real focus of the battle is now online. Here, the
competition is not between the quality of journalism but between
the companies' strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones has one big advantage: its newswire. While other
newspapers worry about how to deliver the immediacy that the
Internet demands, Dow Jones is already in the business of
up-to-the-minute news.
</P>
<P>
   With the newswire, the paper and dedicated online editors and
writers, it has an editorial staff of 1,500. The FT, with 350
journalists on the paper and another 110 working online, is small
by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones has stuck to the model of charging for its online
newspaper. The Journal's Web edition is frequently updated and has
more technology, but it looks like its paper parent, with the same
typeface and long articles that most readers print off.
</P>
<P>
   It had 375,000 paid subscribers ($29 for print-edition
subscribers, $59 for the rest) in December 1999, up from 266,000 a
year earlier _ a real business with real revenues. But elsewhere
the subscription model is being abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   TheStreet.com, a much-hyped but now troubled online rival to the
Journal and the FT, has recently had to move away from it and offer
plenty of free content, and is now looking for a buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that Dow Jones has missed an opportunity. Its
DowJones.com site has not been well marketed.
</P>
<P>
   And wsj.com should have been able to exploit the best brand for
the biggest bull market in history. Yet instead of creating a
Web-based business with a huge market capitalization, it has
treated the Internet as just another distribution channel.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Crovitz, who runs Dow Jones's electronic publishing,
rejects both charges, pointing out that the leap in the company's
stock price is down to analysts' approval of its Web strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps wisely, given the imbalance in resources, the FT is
moving towards a model of Web publishing that avoids direct
competition with the Journal.
</P>
<P>
   It has given up the corporate market: in January, it sold FT
Profile, an archive for corporate intranets, to Lexis-Nexis, a
subsidiary of Reed Elsevier. ``It wasn't large enough to compete,''
says John Makinson, finance director at Pearson.
</P>
<P>
   The FT is instead using the paper's brand to create a business
portal. The journalism is different: the paper is broken up into 15
subject areas, news stories are shorter, and background pieces are
broken up into chunks that are easily read on-screen.
</P>
<P>
   There are sports, restaurant, travel and other partner-sites to
click through to, and a business-oriented search engine. The
content (aside from a few bits of the archive) is free.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge for the FT is to integrate the paper's
journalists with its dot.com journalists. The 25 percent staff
increase over the past four months has been disruptive; paper
journalists look down on their less experienced, lower-paid dot.com
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they will have to learn to work together because, says Peter
Martin, deputy editor of the paper and editorial director of the
Web edition, ``the aim is to bring the entire intellectual engine
of the paper on to the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the company spent Pounds40 million ($65 million) on
FT.com. Revenues were around Pounds7 million ($12 million).
</P>
<P>
   FT.com's strategy relies on Internet advertising taking off. If
it does, the Internet will open up markets that the FT could not
have dreamed of when distribution relied on printing plants and
newspaper boys.
</P>
<P>
   But if instead the Journal's model is right, the Internet may
help it to dominate the world's business newspaper market. &QL;

<P>
   Dow Jones has one big advantage: its newswire. While other
newspapers worry about how to deliver the immediacy that the
Internet demands, Dow Jones is already in the business of
up-to-the-minute news.
</P>
<P>
   With the newswire, the paper and dedicated online editors and
writers, it has an editorial staff of 1,500. The FT, with 350
journalists on the paper and another 110 working online, is small
by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones has stuck to the model of charging for its online
newspaper. The Journal's Web edition is frequently updated and has
more technology, but it looks like its paper parent, with the same
typeface and long articles that most readers print off.
</P>
<P>
   It had 375,000 paid subscribers ($29 for print-edition
subscribers, $59 for the rest) in December 1999, up from 266,000 a
year earlier _ a real business with real revenues. But elsewhere
the subscription model is being abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   TheStreet.com, a much-hyped but now troubled online rival to the
Journal and the FT, has recently had to move away from it and offer
plenty of free content, and is now looking for a buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that Dow Jones has missed an opportunity. Its
DowJones.com site has not been well marketed.
</P>
<P>
   And wsj.com should have been able to exploit the best brand for
the biggest bull market in history. Yet instead of creating a
Web-based business with a huge market capitalization, it has
treated the Internet as just another distribution channel.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Crovitz, who runs Dow Jones's electronic publishing,
rejects both charges, pointing out that the leap in the company's
stock price is down to analysts' approval of its Web strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps wisely, given the imbalance in resources, the FT is
moving towards a model of Web publishing that avoids direct
competition with the Journal.
</P>
<P>
   It has given up the corporate market: in January, it sold FT
Profile, an archive for corporate intranets, to Lexis-Nexis, a
subsidiary of Reed Elsevier. ``It wasn't large enough to compete,''
says John Makinson, finance director at Pearson.
</P>
<P>
   The FT is instead using the paper's brand to create a business
portal. The journalism is different: the paper is broken up into 15
subject areas, news stories are shorter, and background pieces are
broken up into chunks that are easily read on-screen.
</P>
<P>
   There are sports, restaurant, travel and other partner-sites to
click through to, and a business-oriented search engine. The
content (aside from a few bits of the archive) is free.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge for the FT is to integrate the paper's
journalists with its dot.com journalists. The 25 percent staff
increase over the past four months has been disruptive; paper
journalists look down on their less experienced, lower-paid dot.com
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they will have to learn to work together because, says Peter
Martin, deputy editor of the paper and editorial director of the
Web edition, ``the aim is to bring the entire intellectual engine
of the paper on to the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the company spent Pounds40 million ($65 million) on
FT.com. Revenues were around Pounds7 million ($12 million).
</P>
<P>
   FT.com's strategy relies on Internet advertising taking off. If
it does, the Internet will open up markets that the FT could not
have dreamed of when distribution relied on printing plants and
newspaper boys.
</P>
<P>
   But if instead the Journal's model is right, the Internet may
help it to dominate the world's business newspaper market. &QL;

&HT;     WEAK PROSECUTION OR STRONG DEFENSE IN DIALLO CASE? 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By FRED LeBRUN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It's like running off a cliff in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, unexpectedly, the Diallo shooting trial that has
consumed us from the moment the change of venue was announced is
abruptly done with testimony 18 days from the morning the jury pool
gathered at the Albany County Courthouse. The jury, which has had
its ears pinned back by the pace of this trial, gets a deserved
five-day weekend to mull it all over.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Tuesday it's back on the freight train. All those
defense lawyers and the prosecutors will present their summations,
their final arguments. That will take all day. Which means
Wednesday morning the judge should deliver his careful and critical
charge to the jury, after which deliberations begin.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the body of the trial came with such a rush it seemed
to catch even courtroom insiders unprepared. It was known the cops'
lawyers had flown in a psychologist from California to testify
about stress and perception and related issues and that there was
still a New York police supervisor and an emergency medical
technician to hear from. None of the three was called.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Wednesday's testimony from defense witness Dr. James
Fyfe was confusing and disjointed because of limitations placed by
the judge on what he could talk about, it was clearly another good
day for the defense. Fyfe, a former New York police officer and a
specialist in police procedures, training and tactics, managed to
insinuate into the record that the four on trial were doing about
what you'd expect cops to do under the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   For those of us watching on the outside, from the moment officer
Sean Carroll took the stand Monday and gave the police version of
what happened leading to the tragic death of Amadou Diallo in the
Bronx, the momentum of this trial has shifted from the prosecution
to the defense.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one lawyerly wag suggests the prosecution's case peaked
about a week before the trial even began, when the case was still
being tried in the streets. Two theories have emerged as to why the
prosecutors seemed to have been eclipsed: Either that the
prosecution had a weak case and now it's finally showing, which has
been the defense's contention all along. ``Their evidence is our
evidence,'' one of the defense lawyers said over and over. The
other theory is that the prosecuting district attorneys, who
normally work arm in arm with the police fighting crime in the
Bronx, haven't given their very best on this one.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants, after all, are just like the rank-and-file cops
who are the prosecutors' comrades under better circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Whether there's validity to either theory is hard to say, but it
certainly does seem odd how unaggressive the prosecution became
this week. Court TV was predicting that the people would chew alive
Dr. Fyfe on cross-examination as to proper procedures, since quite
obviously proper procedures shouldn't lead to the killing of an
innocent man in a hail of gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   But stupefyingly, the prosecution didn't even cross-examine Dr.
Fyfe. Nor did they present a rebuttal case where they could have at
least placed before the jury again the expert testimony of the
medical examiner. A medical examiner who said the victim was down
and no longer conceivably a threat when several shots were fired at
him.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the prosecution meekly passed on all of it. They may as
well have gotten up and presented a box of roses to the defense
attorneys and given them a big kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's important to remember media accounts generally have
made many of us insiders, which is dangerous when it comes to
handicapping who's on top. Wisely, a jury is shielded from all
this.
</P>
<P>
   And just maybe those jurors can't get past the obvious. That an
innocent man was killed in a hail of police gunfire, and somehow,
that ought to be a crime.
</P>

 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON AND NEW YORK _ It is, in some ways, the best of times for
the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet boom has boosted the Journal's advertising revenue
by 40 percent over last year; at the FT (part-owner of The
Economist) it is up around 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody wants ``brand'' and ``content,'' which both companies
have in spades; the share prices of the papers' parent companies,
Dow Jones and Pearson, have leapt.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is a worrying time, too. Both papers face new competition
_ from online services and from each other.
</P>
<P>
   Since the FT launched its American edition in September 1997,
circulation has jumped, reaching 102,000 in December 1999 _ not yet
a serious threat to the Journal's 1.7 million, but uncomfortable
for an incumbent whose circulation has slipped by 7 percent over a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Now Dow Jones is hitting back in the FT's own territory. Hence
the relaunch, earlier this month, of the Wall Street Journal
Europe, with more staff, more technology coverage and a less
archaic front page.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the FT's second strike: the launch, on Feb. 21, of FT
Deutschland, a German-language daily business newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson will not say how much this new venture is costing, but
100 new journalists (some of whom have left before the launch) do
not come cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   Running the paper as a joint venture with Gruner + Jahr,
Bertelsmann's magazine arm, offsets some risk; but joint ventures
bring their own problems.
</P>
<P>
   So why take the risk? Because Germany is Europe's biggest
market, which the FT, with a circulation there of 22,000, has
barely penetrated. And German business journalism is stodgy and
slow.
</P>
<P>
   When Oskar Lafontaine resigned as finance minister at 6 p.m.,
the German papers scraped a mention, while the FT had the full
story.
</P>
<P>
   But now the Journal has weighed in with the competition.
Handelsblatt, Germany's main business daily, has a Journal editor
in its offices, and is using Journal copy. The front article is
already livelier.
</P>
<P>
   But the real focus of the battle is now online. Here, the
competition is not between the quality of journalism but between
the companies' strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones has one big advantage: its newswire. While other
newspapers worry about how to deliver the immediacy that the
Internet demands, Dow Jones is already in the business of
up-to-the-minute news.

   PRINCETON, N.J. _ It happened almost half a century ago, in a
war that most Americans barely recall.
</P>
<P>
   But the inquiry now going on into the killing in 1950 of a large
number of people at an obscure hamlet in South Korea promises to
bring a murky subject into the uncomfortable daylight of modern
ideas about war.
</P>
<P>
   Last month a blue-ribbon panel of American investigators
returned to South Korea to continue their inquiries into the
incident at No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   The story came to light in September, when the Associated Press
ran a starkly detailed account of American soldiers who said they
had gunned down scores, maybe hundreds, of South Korean civilians
in three days in late July 1950.
</P>
<P>
   It is painful for Americans to think of American soldiers
committing war crimes, not least because the allegation about No
Gun Ri comes at a time when an attempt is being made to set up an
international system of war-crimes tribunals that might one day
point a finger at the American troops to whom much of the world
looks for its security.
</P>
<P>
   At first, American army officials had shrugged off the No Gun Ri
accusation. But, once the AP had published its story, the
government moved smartly.
</P>
<P>
   William Cohen, the secretary of defense, ordered Louis Caldera,
the Army secretary, to lead that team of investigators.
</P>
<P>
   A patently independent-minded bunch, these include a former
Washington Post reporter, Don Oberdorfer, and a Harvard history
professor, Ernest May, as well as General Robert Ricassi, a former
commander of American forces in Korea. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   At the time, the American Army in Korea was no juggernaut. The
Americans who stumbled into action at the beginning of July 1950 to
help South Korea repel the invading North Korean communists were an
ill-prepared lot, pulled away from the relatively cushy job of
occupying Japan.
</P>
<P>
   They were driven ignominiously and bloodily into a southern
corner of the Korean peninsula by the ferocity of the
Soviet-equipped North Korean People's Army. It was not until well
after the No Gun Ri killings that they began to push their way back
northwards. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the AP's account, the Americans at No Gun Ri had
been at the front for only three days. They were worried that North
Korean soldiers were hiding themselves among South Korean refugees,
and they had orders not to let refugees cross their lines.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the soldiers told the AP that they knew there were
women and children in the crowd hiding under a bridge at No Gun Ri;
one soldier says he shot over their heads rather than kill
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera's panel will have to weigh all these things. The last
time America took a serious look at a war crime of its own, it
botched the job.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1968 an American infantry company killed several
hundred civilians, including children, at two hamlets in Vietnam,
one of them the now infamous My Lai 4. The killing was led by
Lieutenant William Calley.
</P>
<P>
   A commission under a lieutenant-general recommended charging 30
people for covering up the massacre, but only one, a colonel, was
eventually court-martialled, and he was acquitted. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 550) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant Calley's superior officer, Captain Ernest Medina, was
also court-martialled but acquitted. A few soldiers were charged,
but were either acquitted or had the charges against them
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Lieutenant Calley himself was sentenced in 1971 to
life with hard labor for killing or causing the deaths of over 100
Vietnamese. But President Richard Nixon stepped in: the young
killer served only three years, mostly under house arrest in Fort
Benning. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has backed the creation of two United
Nations war-crimes tribunals; they will look into the slaughter of
civilians that took place in Rwanda and ex-Yugoslavia in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in June 1998, a U.N. conference in Rome agreed to set up a
permanent International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute people
accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity anywhere in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   But what is a war crime?
</P>
<P>
   The United States is not happy about the ICC. The definition of
a war crime is still far from clear. To kill civilians deliberately
and unnecessarily is clearly a crime. To kill them wh are
inextricably mixed up with armed enemies who are trying to kill you
is probably not.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Defense Department worries that its soldiers, trying to
help some future Kosovo, may be accused by people whose chief
interest is tripping America up of doing the first when in fact
they weren't.
</P>
<P>
   That anxiety has been heightened by the ex-Yugoslavia war-crimes
tribunal, which was created in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, the tribunal's chief prosecutor, Carla Del
Ponte, revealed that she was studying a preliminary report
assembled for her predecessor of complaints about possible war
crimes committed during NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia, which
liberated Kosovo from Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's
repression.
</P>
<P>
   Furore. NATO officials, who had relished the tribunal's
indictment of Milosevic last May as a vindication of NATO's fight,
were horrified. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM _ 125 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 875) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal is in a delicate position. It has no police force
of its own, and relies on NATO countries to carry out war-crimes
arrests in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   It also relies on NATO countries, principally the United States,
for much of the intelligence data needed for evidence against the
most egregious offenders.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it cannot refuse, without endangering its claim to
impartiality, to investigate complaints made by Serbia, Russia and
some human-rights lawyers that certain aspects of NATO's bombing
breached the Geneva Conventions on what can be done in a war.
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte says she is studying documents presented by NATO's
accusers, but makes it clear that she has taken no decision whether
to open a ``formal inquiry.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF THIRD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,325) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   America's generals, not noticeably keen on humanitarian wars of
intervention in the first place, are going to be doubly resentful
if human-rights-minded liberals get them into a humanitarian war
and then expose American soldiers to prosecution for what they do
in that war.
</P>
<P>
   The generals, and their government, are therefore squirming. And
anti-Americans abroad, whether of the hard-core Serb variety or the
soft-core French sort, enjoy watching America squirm.
</P>
<P>
   No country relishes talking about its failures. Americans are
roughly as unhappy about My Lai or the B-52 bombing of Vietnam _ or
the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki _ as Britons
are with the firebombing of Dresden or Frenchmen with the bloody
war they fought to try to keep Algeria French.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is to a country's credit if it is prepared to stare hard
at its own past. That is the basic case for Caldera and his team
doing a thorough job at No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   Although the proposed new ICC would have the power to look only
into alleged war crimes committed after its creation, and so would
have no jurisdiction in this case, how the No Gun Ri investigation
is conducted will be seen as a test of America's resolve on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   The ICC's rules say that any country can have first go at
prosecuting its own war-crimes suspects; the ICC can step in only
if it rules that the country concerned has fluffed it, either
through malice or incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   Had an ICC been around when Nixon gave his helping hand to
Lieutenant Calley, it might have been tempted to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   But if America shows about No Gun Ri the dedication to the rule
of law that it prides itself on, agonizingly difficult though it
may be to decide exactly what happened there, it will demonstrate
to the rest of the world that it obeys the rules it expects others
to honor.
</P>
<P>
   The world's policeman can police itself. &QL;

   MCCAIN-VETERANS (Columbia) _ For all the focus on the
independents and Democrats, the McCain camp says its secret weapon
on Saturday is whether veterans turn out. Bush forces concede as
much, saying veterans could be a big problem for them, and they are
engaged in a behind the scenes drive to keep McCain from snatching
the vet vote. An inside look at the battle over veterans, as part

   BUSH-ASSESS (Dateline to kum, S.C.) _ When he first began
preparing to run for the presidency, George W. Bush was seen as the
savior of the GOP. He was young, different and brought with him a
message of unity not division, all qualities that the party
desperately needed to regain the White House. But in the 17 days
since he lost the New Hampshire primary, Bush has become a
Republican of the old generation, appealing to the right and
resorting to the same sort of harshly negative campaign tactics
that his father used when his back was against the wall. A news
analysis by Frank Bruni. (1200 words)

   MEXICO-OIL (Veracruz, Mexico) _ For two years, Mexico has worked
with other oil rich nations to pump up petroleum prices. But now
that those efforts have borne fruit, senior officials in recent
days have done an about face and are trying to talk the world price
back down. Mexico's economy is now too integrated with the U.S. for
Mexico to rock the boat on oil prices. By Sam Dillon.

   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ Consumer prices rose less than expected
in January as the biggest drop in clothing costs in 11 years held
down the effects of higher heating oil, gasoline and tobacco costs.
The Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent in January, the same rate
as in each of the previous three months. That was smaller than the
0.3 percent gain that Wall Street had been expecting. But core
prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy sectors,
accelerated as expected to a rate of 0.2 percent, twice the rate in
December. By Louis Uchitelle.

<P>
   It happened almost half a century ago, in a war that most
Americans barely recall. The story came to light in September, when
the Associated Press ran a starkly detailed account of American
soldiers who said they had gunned down perhaps hundreds of South
Korean civilians in three days in July 1950. Although it is
agonizing to think of U.S. soldiers committing war atrocities,
America must clear the air _ and its conscience _ over No Gun Ri.
The last time America took a serious look at a war crime of its own
_ the infamous My Lai Massacre in 1968 _ it botched the job. &QL;

   Bob Dole recently told a TV audience that the reason he had a
Band-Aid on his thumb was that he had pricked himself in his rush
to replace his Bush button with a McCain one. ``You couldn't find a
McCain button on anybody yesterday,'' he drolly noted, ``but today
they're all over the place.'' Well, not quite all over the place.
There are precious few McCain badges on the lapels of Dole's old
cronies at the heart of the Republican establishment. Why? Because
McCain represents a gigantic threat to the way it does business. &QL;

   Negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority are
frozen. This may be the worst moment for the Palestinians since
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was elected last year. Ominously,
many Palestinians feel that Barak's vision of a final settlement in
the peace process bears an uncanny resemblance to the one touted by
his despised predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu. &QL;

   American servicemen, arriving in the Philippines for their first
military exercises in the country for nearly five years, are liable
to get the wrong idea when they hear that local women have been
burning their underpants in public in anticipation. The
knicker-burning was, in fact, a gesture of protest by a group who
believe that the return of American troops will bring more rape,
prostitution and sexually-transmitted disease and add to the
numbers of unwanted mixed-race children. &QL;

   ``After 70 years of drinking Coca-Cola, it becomes a habit _ you

executive, should use this metaphor to explain why so many Mexicans
carry on voting for the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)
after seven decades of its rule. But it aptly sums up the task he
now faces. He must persuade Mexicans to switch their political
brand loyalty, to something most have never tasted. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority are
frozen. This may be the worst moment for the Palestinians since
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was elected last year. Ominously,
many Palestinians feel that Barak's vision of a final settlement in
the peace process bears an uncanny resemblance to the one touted by
his despised predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu. &QL;

   American servicemen, arriving in the Philippines for their first
military exercises in the country for nearly five years, are liable
to get the wrong idea when they hear that local women have been
burning their underpants in public in anticipation. The
knicker-burning was, in fact, a gesture of protest by a group who
believe that the return of American troops will bring more rape,
prostitution and sexually-transmitted disease and add to the
numbers of unwanted mixed-race children. &QL;

   ``After 70 years of drinking Coca-Cola, it becomes a habit _ you

&HT;     GIANTS' RELIEVER STICKS BY ROCKER, BUT NOT HIS REMARKS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN SHEA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ John Rocker is a lonely man these days,
distanced from his teammates and detached from the game he
disgraced. He's out of sight, but not out of mind. From Arizona to
Florida, where spring training opens this week, he remains a
subject of scorn.
</P>
<P>
   When and if he returns to baseball, he'll have few supporters
and few teammates, opponents or fans he'd call a friend.
</P>
<P>
   One will be San Francisco Giants reliever Alan Embree.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he needs someone to talk to, I might be the only one in the
world who might listen to him right now,'' Embree said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody on the Giants knows Rocker as Embree does. They're both
left-handed relievers, both raised in the country, both
outdoorsmen, both linked to the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the parallels end, and Embree makes it crystal
clear. Embree is still Rocker's good pal, still his hunting
partner, along with Ryan Klesko, another ex-Brave. But even Embree
distanced himself the moment he read Rocker's offensive comments in
Sports Illustrated last December.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker will hear as early as next week whether an arbitrator
decides to shorten his suspension now scheduled to run through May
1. He was also fined $20,000 and ordered to undergo sensitivity
training for his abusive remarks about foreigners, minorities and
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to him and said, `Boy, you screwed up good, didn't
you, buddy?''' Embree said. ``I looked at it as, `What the hell are
you doing? I wouldn't want you to say that around my family.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He made everybody mad. He made me mad. We can be hunting
buddies, but I've got a family to think about and I don't want
people thinking those are my beliefs because I don't share them.''
</P>
<P>
   Embree said he doesn't believe Rocker is a racist, that he ran
his mouth without thinking clearly or considering the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``He regrets what he said,'' Embree said. ``A lot of people say
John isn't sorry for what he did, that he's doing only what he
needs to do to stay in the game. That's not true. He genuinely is
sorry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know him as a person, you realize it was a statement
from a brash, young person that someone took and ran with. I'm not
defending anything he said, but I do think he's sorry. Hopefully,
someone's going to give him a second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone other than the Braves. Embree doesn't expect Rocker to
pitch another inning for that team.
</P>
<P>
   ``As culturally diverse as Atlanta is, I don't see how he could
possibly stay,'' Embree said. ``He went from being one of Atlanta's
favorite sons _ a Macon boy, a local favorite _ to America's most
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd have to play for a less culturally diverse city, but you
travel a lot no matter where you play. Do you send him to
Pittsburgh? Kansas City? For that matter, Texas?''
</P>
<P>
   Not San Francisco. No way. The Giants could use another
left-handed reliever _ Embree is all they have _ but the last thing
they need is a mob of anti-Rocker protesters marching through
Willie Mays Plaza during the opening of Pacific Bell Park. A club
executive said on Thursday that it would never happen.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Dusty Baker broke in with the Braves in the '60s, not an
easy place or time for a young African-American raised in
Sacramento and Riverside. It goes without saying that, like most
others, Baker was disturbed by Rocker's comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, he's got problems,'' he said. ``The sad part about the
whole thing is, he's probably not the only person who feels that
way. Some places around the country, he's probably a hero. Sad, but
true.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rocker is one reason Embree is a Giant. He was traded from
Atlanta to Arizona in June 1998 because the Braves decided to stick
with Rocker, who was younger and cheaper than Embree. The following
winter, Embree was dealt to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   While a Brave, Embree got close to Rocker. But he never
envisioned this.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to have to prove to baseball and the fans of
Atlanta, or wherever he plays, that he's really not that kind of
guy,'' Embree said. ``He'll have to pick where he hangs out. I can
honestly say I wouldn't be doing much with him during the season if
I were his teammate. He'll have to be looking over his shoulder the
whole time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gifted, but he has his spazzy tendencies. He rubs lot of
people the wrong way, but that's the way he is. Does that mean he's
not my friend anymore? No, he's still my friend.''

CELEBRATING A WINTER JOY: `LA BELLE PETITE MACHINE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VALCOURT, Quebec _ Nestled in the Riviere Noire valley, just 30
miles north of Vermont, is a shrine to the man and the machine that
revolutionized winter recreation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to history, I'm like, `Ugh, boring!,' But I
really wanted to come here,'' said Annette Turgeon, 32, of Bangor.
</P>
<P>
   Turgeon, her husband and their two sons roared into the parking
lot of the J. Armand Bombardier Museum the other day astride their
four gleaming sleds _ as snowmobiles are called by the 2.1 million
North Americans for whom they are a high-powered passion.
</P>
<P>
   Removing her kaleidoscopic crash helmet, she scrutinized the
meticulously restored old workshop attached to the museum, just a
snowball's toss from the giant modern factory that churned out her
noisy, speedy snow machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awesome, being where it all began,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the snarl of engines and whiff of exhaust are commonplace
throughout snow country, from the Inuit realms of Canada's Nunavut
Territory to the Sierra Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   But back in 1922, when a 15-year-old farmboy named Joseph-Armand
Bombardier started tinkering with a Model T engine, a wooden
airplane propeller and a battered set of sleigh runners, snow
travel meant slogging on rawhide-webbed shoes or mushing behind a
dogsled.
</P>
<P>
   The fruit of his first labor was a snorting monstrosity that
spat blue smoke and threatened to dismember gawking bystanders with
a rear-mounted blade that spun madly in the air, powering the rig
over and through the drifts.
</P>
<P>
   Aghast, Bombardier's father ordered young Joseph-Armand to
immediately dismantle the contraption in the interest of public
safety.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no killing the dream. Over the next few decades,
Bomabardier would design and build a series of treaded snow
vehicles that served as logging machines, transports for mining
prospectors, military ambulances for winter battlefields and
conveyances for rural doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The machines, like those of competing inventor-entrepreneurs in
the United States, were too cumbersome and pricey for the average
Jacques, or Joe, though.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1959, Bombardier's modest factory garage in Valcourt
started turning out a new, lightweight, inexpensive and highly
maneuverable vehicle to whip a rider through the winterscapes.
</P>
<P>
   He christened it the Ski-Dog. A printing accident gave it a new
name: the Ski-Doo. And history was made.
</P>
<P>
   By most reckonings, the brightly painted machine was the first
mass-produced recreational snowmobile. A new winter industry was
born.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joseph-Armand transformed life in northern places,'' said
Louise Lemay, communications officer for the museum, which attracts
35,000 visitors a year to this French-Canadian town. Valcourt also
remains home to the Bombardier Inc. plant where Ski-Doos rumble off
the assembly lines _ 2.3 million units to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a wonderful recreational vehicle that brought joy to
so many people who used to feel trapped by winter,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There's another view, of course.
</P>
<P>
   In the minds of critics, snowmobiles are high-revving,
exhaust-spewing despoilers of nature _ polluting the air, smashing
silence and running roughshod over public lands and private
property.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, 40 years after becoming a fixture of rural life,
snowmobiles are the subject of bitter debate over their use in
national parks and other pristine places.
</P>
<P>
   The battles rage on, in courts and in feuds that have split
communities. But Americans and Canadians continue to purchase about
210,000 ``sleds'' a year, and snowmobile registrations in the two
countries have risen 32 percent over the past six years, according
to the International Snowmobile Manufacturers Association, an
organization of the ``Big Four'' makers _ Bombardier in Canada;
Polaris and Arctic Cat, both based in Minnesota; and Japan's
Yamaha.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph-Armand Bombardier himself died in 1964, having founded
one of Canada's greatest industrial empires. The company's various
divisions today manufacture everything from passenger jetliners to
subway cars, employing 53,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think, for the average person, we are still best known
for `la belle petite machine,' '' Lemay said.
</P>
<P>
   Bombardier's ``lovely little machine'' and the treaded growlers
manufactured by competing companies form the core of an industry
estimated at more than $10 billion annually in North America alone.
</P>
<P>
   Actual snowmobile sales account for only about $1.2 billion of
that, with the real economic benefit coming from tourist dollars
spent by snowmobilers.
</P>
<P>
   Americans and Canadians, with their wide open spaces and booming
economies, are far and away the world's most avid snowmobilers.
``But it's starting to seriously take off in Scandinavia,'' said
Edward Klim, president of the snowmobile manufacturers' group.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Finland is doing what states like Minnesota and
provinces like Quebec have been doing for years _ aggressively
marketing themselves as centers for the sport, offering thousands
of miles of free marked trails. And no wonder: According to one
study, the typical snowmobile tourist forks out $4,218 a year for
hotel rooms, fuel, meals and other goods or services.
</P>
<P>
   Said a Quebec official involved with promoting tourism:
``Cross-country skiers bring their own granola bars. Snowmobilers
come with wallets full of Visa cards and cash.''
</P>
<P>
   The typical snowmobiler is 40, married with 0.8 kids, has an
annual income of $56,000 a year, drives a sports utility vehicle or
pickup truck, plunks down $5,780 for a typical 500-cc snowmobile
and rides it 1,202 miles a year, according to the International
Snowmobile Manufacturers Assn.
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrims to the Bombardier Museum arrive from as far away as
Argentina and Russia, but they are mostly from across Canada and
the colder regions of the United States. If the Canadians are drawn
by the mystique of the inventor, Americans come mainly, it seems,
to marvel at the displays of vintage snow machines.
</P>
<P>
   There's the Bombardier ``B-7,'' for example, a 1936 V-8 powered
vehicle that carried driver and up to six passengers in what looked
like a Volkswagen Beetle mounted on skis and Caterpillar tracks. It
was popular, according to the museum, with ``country doctors,
funeral directors and priests.''
</P>
<P>
   Snowmobilers have attained speeds of 190 mph, and have conquered
the North Pole. They've hauled elephants in pulling contests,
skimmed across lakes in the popular if preposterous competition
``water cross'' _ goal: see how far you can travel before you sink
_ and shot off ramps to fly 108.2 feet through the air, the current
world record.
</P>
<P>
   The snowmobile, it seems, represents one of the great cultural
ties across the northern border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans and Canadians love the same stuff,'' said Alain
Bishop, 27, of Ontario, gliding up to the museum's popular ``la
machine extravagante'' racing snowmobile exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially,'' he said, admiring the glittering chrome exhausts
of the supercharged, 12-cylinder engine, ``anything that burns lots
of gasoline, goes fast and is kind of dangerous.''

MCCAIN'S EFFORT DRAWING FEW BLACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. HELENA ISLAND, S.C. _ One sparkling morning in the glory
days just after his New Hampshire victory, a jubilant Senator John
McCain stood on the steps of a grand antebellum mansion overlooking
the salt marshes a few miles from here in Beaufort, telling of his
greatest victory.
</P>
<P>
   Better than winning on Feb. 1, he told his audience of 200, was
drawing new voters to the polls, and, more importantly, to the
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   The only African-American in the audience that day was the Rev.
Kenneth F. Hodges, pastor of the nearby Tabernacle Baptist Church,
one of the country's oldest black churches, with a congregation of
more than 500. Hodges happened to be reading the paper that morning
and noticed that McCain would be appearing, so he caught the end of
the Arizona senator's address.
</P>
<P>
   But Hodges is still an Al Gore man.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a candidate is going to be down the street, and if I, as
leader of one of the larger churches, don't know about it till I
read it in that day's headlines, that tells me there's not a
concerted effort to reach out to the minority community,'' Hodges
said this week.
</P>
<P>
   It has become the mantra of the McCain campaign, the ringing
rationale for his candidacy: that his campaign can reform the
Republican Party by broadening its base, remaking the GOP in the
image of its great heroes: Ronald Reagan, Teddy Roosevelt, and
Abraham Lincoln. The Arizona senator invokes all three presidents
constantly.
</P>
<P>
   But while Reagan's Republican Party might glisten tantalizingly
on McCain's horizon, as he draws independents and Democrats to his
cause, that of Lincoln remains well out of reach. Despite McCain's
constant assertions that his candidacy typifies a new kind of
inclusiveness and broad appeal, he concedes that he has done little
to draw black voters _ as much as 45 percent of the Democratic
electorate by some estimates _ into his new big tent. His rival
George W. Bush has, if anything, done less.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a long way to go,'' McCain said in an interview
aboard his campaign bus. ``A long way to go. I can't parachute into
South Carolina in 19 days and say, `Everybody, here I am, all
African-Americans flock to my banner.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Audiences at the candidates' town hall meetings and rallies are
always overwhelmingly white. Sometimes, an audience of a thousand
or more might include one or two blacks, but seldom more. Their
absence is due to more than the candidates' sidestepping the
Confederate flag flap, or flubbing questions of race on the
hustings, though both contribute. The majority of African-American
voters in South Carolina _ almost 90 percent _ have been wedded to
the Democratic Party in national elections for decades, and remain
so, `New South' or no.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for that are easy to find in places like St. Helena
Island _ just a few miles across the water, but a world apart, from
bustling Beaufort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people from St. Helena Island, they've been here
all their life,'' said Julius Green, 31, who is proprietor of
Jus'Hair and Accessories, and is black. ``My uncle and dad, and my
mother, they're not going to even listen, they'll vote the straight
ticket. (Republicans) ain't ever been for us, and that's what's
instilled in the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All my life I've been a Democrat,'' said Harold Washington,
59, a lifelong resident of the island, which is 65 percent black.
``The Democrats offered more to the African-Americans. Clinton does
an outstanding job.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always this way, of course. Especially not here on St.
Helena Island, where the first slaves in America were freed in
1861, just six months into the Civil War. Abraham Lincoln made
devout Republicans of Green's forbears.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1950s African-American voters' support for the Republican
Party had ebbed, as democrats Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry
S. Truman began programs to deal with problems of the poor, who
were disproportionately black, and the Democratic Party became
associated with the nation's first, tentative steps toward civil
rights protections.
</P>
<P>
   The flight went both ways: In 1948, Strom Thurmond led
conservative Democrats out of the party to protest Truman's
concessions to the poor and minorities, and ran for president as a
``Dixiecrat.''
</P>
<P>
   The steady trickle of voters away from each party, blacks from
the Republicans and whites from the Democrats, became gushing
torrents with the Civil Rights struggles of the early 1960s, when
Martin Luther King Jr. met with colleagues to plot strategy on St.
Helena Island. When President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting
Rights Act of 1965, removing the literacy qualification for
Southern black voters, thousands of African-Americans registered as
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And most of South Carolina's black voters, who numbered 300,000
of a total 1.1 million voters in the 1998 gubernatorial election,
are stalwart party loyalists to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the statewide level, blacks who do turn out give Democrats
80 or 90 percent of their votes,'' said Bruce Ransom, associate
professor of political science at Clemson University. ``It's not
unusual in a presidental race to see the Republican nominee get 7
or 8 percent of that vote.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain hopes to break that pattern, though not through any
direct appeal. Instead, he believes the broad issues he cares most
about should resonate with African-Americans: better treatment of
veterans, better opportunities for small businesses, better access
to education and training, giving government back to ordinary
Americans. He said his vision of ``a populist, reform Republican
Party'' would draw ``the allegiance of a lot of people who are not
normally Republican supporters, and that would include
African-Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   His vision finds admirers in a smattering of black voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He experienced everything that came to us,'' said Danny C.
Lindsay, of Rock Hill, S.C., a Vietnam veteran and former POW who
was at McCain's town hall meeting in Fort Mill last weekend. ``He
knows about the VA. I don't care if I'm the only African-American
in this place. I feel the same way everybody in this place does.''
</P>
<P>
   Charleston Police Chief Reuben Greenberg, who describes himself
as both a Democrat and a conservative, has endorsed McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain has no association with any antiblack issues,'' said
Greenberg. ``In national elections black voters are captors of the
Democratic party. I'm not a captive of anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   And there remains the possibility that if Democrats generally
choose to participate in the GOP primary _ which is open to all
voters regardless of party _ more blacks like Greenberg will join
in. Earlier this week, federal judges ordered the state GOP to open
polling places it has kept closed in recent years, many of which
are in predominantly black districts.
</P>
<P>
   These are districts that, in many cases, have not been remade in
the mold of the vaunted `New South.' In recent years, industry and
northern immigrants have flooded the region, and South Carolina has
been no exception. In 1992, BMW opened a factory here that makes Z3
roadsters, and auto accessories manufacturers soon followed.
Beaufort is the New South in a nutshell: McCain's host that morning
after the primary was its mayor, Bill Rauch, and, like many
Beaufort County residents, a transplant from the liberal northeast
_ a former press secretary to New York City Mayor Ed Koch.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, life on St. Helena Island hasn't budged much, and
neither have most of its residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll base my decision on how I was brought up,'' Green said.
``The South is more heritage than education. Surviving on our land
and fishing and working the river. Ain't no big buildings round
here, no BMW factories down here.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain recognizes the desirability of pressing his appeal beyond
the state's newly prosperous sections, and its white majority.
</P>
<P>
   He cited his long history of seeking to improve relations with
the Hispanic community in Arizona as evidence that he could win the
trust of minority voters. In 1998, after 15 years in the Congress,
he finally received a majority _ 52 percent _ of Hispanic votes in
his home state. Bush, too, touts his success with Hispanic voters:
Every day, he says, ``I'm a uniter, not a divider.'' In 1998, he
garnered 49 percent of their votes.
</P>
<P>
   But if black voters are slow to warm to the Republican cause,
neither Bush nor McCain have stepped forward to embrace them,
either, said many observers. Instead, they have been cautious, to
avoid alienating conservative white voters.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of them has taken a position on the Confederate flag
issue in South Carolina, except to say that it is a matter for the
state to decide.
</P>
<P>
   Both have said they support the idea of affirmative action, but
not quotas. And both have pilloried Clinton, who still enjoys
extremely high approval ratings among black voters here.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he had consultants on black communities in
Washington, but that he had not set up an outreach organization for
black communities in South Carolina. Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer
said the same for the Texas governor. And that annoys Hodges, the
Beaufort pastor.
</P>
<P>
   ``African-American voters are concerned about the same issues as
others,'' Hodges said. ``But they need to be in the audience, in
the room to hear (what a candidate will do about) it.''
</P>
<P>
   Incidents like the one at a Bush town hall meeting on Tuesday
only reinforce the image of the GOP as disconnected from black
voters. There, Rev. Samuel T. Ross-Lee, pastor of the Gill Creek
Baptist Church in Columbia, rose to ask a question about the
Confederate flag. Ross-Lee is African-American.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's response was to ask Ross-Lee if he was with the news
media. When Ross-Lee pursued his question, he was booed and made to
sit down by other audience members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not asking him to take the flag down,'' an angry Ross-Lee
said afterward. ``I'm asking him to take a stand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons the Republicans don't have the kinds of
votes they want from the black community is because they make
assumptions,'' he said. ``The governor makes the assumption that a
black man in a suit in a crowd of white people must be a
reporter.''
</P>
<P>
   Some black voters are tuning into the Republican contest anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like John McCain,'' Harold Washington said. ``He's got a
good point. I don't think Bush is ready for president. You want to
know who the next president is? Bill Bradley. But if I were to vote
for a Republican, I'd vote for McCain, because McCain is real.''
</P>
<P>
   But Washington hastened to add that all of this was purely
academic: ``I ain't no Republican, now!''

HEIGHTENED PACE MAY DOOM MCCAIN'S `STRAIGHT TALK EXPRESS'

<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ It's almost time to say goodbye to the bus.
</P>
<P>
   When the presidential campaign shifts to multistate warfare next
week, Senator John McCain will be forced to leave the warm cocoon
of his customized tour bus that helped carry him from relative
obscurity to national fame.
</P>
<P>
   The new schedule will demand jet charters for cross-country
travel, and though McCain's staff hopes to preserve some of the
intimate atmosphere of the bus, there is a fear that some of the
informal je ne sais quoi that the candidate created during his long
hours aboard it will be lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to think about it'' McCain said the other day when
asked about the need for security as his campaign intensifies. ``It
changes your life. I shudder at the prospect.''
</P>
<P>
   While Texas Governor George W. Bush is protected by Texas
Rangers, not a single security officer stands between McCain and
the crowds. The Arizona senator has also served as his own
spokesman since his campaign began months ago, conducting
free-wheeling, informal talkathons with an alternating cast of a
dozen reporters in the back of his bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to abandon the bus,'' said Mike Murphy, a
McCain adviser. After leaving South Carolina following Saturday's
primary, the candidate will barnstorm through Michigan by bus for
two days before the Michigan primary on Tuesday. McCain will then
switch to planes, but Murphy said the senator will continue to hold
frequent sessions with reporters in midair and will revert to bus
trips, when possible, for a couple of days on the ground in
California and in New York before the wave of primaries there and
elsewhere on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   But the days of the McCain parade, rolling relentlessly through
the back roads of New Hampshire and the highways of South Carolina,
are nearly over.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain calls the caravan the Straight Talk Express, it
has more closely resembled a Magical Mystery Tour.
</P>
<P>
   In a scene crawling with dozens of TV camera crews, hundreds of
writers and commentators, and a photo corps, the McCain bus became
a throwback to the days when President Eisenhower conducted daily
press conferences in the Oval Office with the cluster of reporters
assigned to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate has compared his bus performances to a high-wire
act. By making himself available, on the record, for nonstop
questioning, McCain has occasionally blundered. He had to issue
clarifications regarding his position on abortion and the
Confederate battle flag that flies over the South Carolina Capitol
building. Usually, however, he has succeeded in making his points
and in beguiling the press.
</P>
<P>
   Though he invariably introduces the press as ``Trotskyites and
communists'' at each campaign event and invites the audience to
discuss with them ``the liberal bias of the media,'' the candidate
who calls himself ``a proud Republican conservative'' has
established a unique relationship with the men and women who cover
him.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, a New York Times columnist, Frank Rich, pondered
McCain's rise. ``Is this because of the media's infatuation with
him,'' Rich asked, ``a love affair so outrageously sugary it
threatens to toss the entire nation into insulin shock?''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the McCain bus sessions have the feel of a dormitory
bull session, complete with coffee and doughnuts, in which the
upperclassman holds forth on a variety of subjects.
</P>
<P>
   In a round of seemingly interminable trips this week, the
candidate talked for hours. With little prodding, he explained his
position on Kosovo and his opposition to subsidies for ethanol, the
fuel product made from corn. He covered the nuances of gun control
and the nuisance of the big-money interests in politics.
</P>
<P>
   When he saw that his face, which appeared on the covers of all
the newsmagazines last week, had been replaced this week by Time
magazine with the image of teen idol Leonardo DiCaprio, he
delivered a mock gurgle. ``Aaargh,'' McCain howled. ``Androgynous
Leo! I thought he was washed up. I thought he was finished.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain also flashed a less humorous side _ his well-known
temper. When Cynthia Tucker, editorial page editor of the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, prefaced a question by calling McCain
``ultraconservative,'' he rejected the description vigorously.
``Ultra has the connotation of an extreme voting record,'' he shot
back. ``It's an insult to the people of Arizona to say I'm ultra
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Then another Atlanta journalist, Bill Nigut of WSB-TV, brought
up the name of Georgia's Democratic governor, Roy Barnes, in a
discussion of school vouchers. ``You're not doing very well,''
McCain said as Nigut's face flushed. ``Whether Governor Barnes is
for vouchers is irrelevant to a national election.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's staff suddenly summoned the candidate to the front of
the bus to respond to a nonexistent telephone call. They took him
out of the presence of the reporters, an aide later acknowledged,
to cool off McCain for a couple of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet during the same session, McCain made an interesting
confession in response to a question about the Republican Party's
relationship with American people of color. McCain noted that he
had strong support from Hispanics and American Indians in his
state, but added, ``I'm not particularly proud of my record with
African-Americans, mainly because I'm a senator from a state where
the African-American population is small.''
</P>
<P>
   He criticized his own party on this score. ``I believe the
Republican Party . . . has unintentionally alienated large numbers
of Hispanics.'' Ballot initiatives instigated by Republicans
against immigration in California have ``exacerbated'' the
situation, he said. ``The reality is that in California, with 32
million people, the alienation among the Hispanic community should
disturb any Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the campaign, McCain has discovered that outspoken
comments, delivered in the setting of a moving bus, have helped
turn him into a champion of disaffected Republicans and independent
voters.
</P>
<P>
   His staff also recognizes the importance of the bus. ``We're
going to keep it,'' Murphy said. ``It's just that it'll have wings
instead of wheels.''

THE JOURNAL'S HEADY ASSIGNMENT: PROP UP BUSH LITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the occasional pleasures of doing what I do for a living
is casting a mischievous eye over the barrel rolls and backflips of
the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal, self-crowned ``daily
diary of the American Dream,'' where subscriber median income
surpasses $100,000 and editorials are devoted to the succoring of
the 250,000 American households with more than $1 million income,
thanks in no small measure to the triumph of Clinton-Gore economic
policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal's contempt for the Great Unwashed, and its venomous
disdain for the proletariat and their tribunes, most notably Bill
Clinton, Ted Kennedy, Reverend Jesse Jackson, the labor movement in
general, and lately Al Gore in particular was never more pithily
summarized than in the cogent dictum of an earlier aristocracy:
``Let them eat cake.''
</P>
<P>
   The Journal's immediate political task, now much more formidable
than when it wearily shouldered the chore of propping up the
nascent Bush II Primary Victory Tour, is to destroy the ambitions
of Senator John McCain and his crusaders, thereby preventing the
Republican Party from falling into the hands of a charismatic
military hero and seasoned senator who would actually have the
will, skill and nerve to dismantle the corrupt system of political
funding that rules the D.C. swamp.
</P>
<P>
   Propping up Bush Jr. is not a task the Journal's wrecking crew
relishes. The candidate that former President Poppy called ``The
Boy'' got entangled in too much ``compassionate conservative''
wrapping paper for the Journal's taste. But somebody's gotta save
his sorry hide from the wrath of the primary voters. And into the
breach steps our brothers from Wall Street. They've not faced such
a cheerless chore since they beat the drum hollowly for Bob Dole,
in the last presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Having gone Oh-for-two against Clinton-Gore, the Journal's
leg-breakers thought they had an easy winner in Bush Lite. Alas,
the Bush support gurgled down the McDrain in New Hampshire. The
jaunty Arizonan proved to be the McBain of the Journal's existence.
Sure, John's a true-blue conservative, sure, he's sound on the
fiscal stuff, and if truth be told, Bush's phony tax cut is less
grownup than McCain's let-pay-down-the-deficit-boys-and-girls
approach.
</P>
<P>
   If the Journal chrome-domes really believed all that
sanctimonious blather they churn out about discipline,
self-reliance, boot-strapping, and eat-your-spinach, they'd be for
McCain, a warrior prophet with a magnificent mission in mind.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's core issue is campaign finance reform. That goes to
the heart of what preserves the Republican congressional
leadership's majority. Without the special interest money flowing
through Trent Lott's veins, the Congress would be a lot more
responsive to the folks on the bottom, instead of desperately
defensive on behalf of the folks on the top.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Journal is trying to defend Bush's shameless
onslaught of negative advertising in South Carolina. If Bush Lite
does not prevail there Saturday, his lavishly financed campaign
goes into the ditch. Not since Reagan wrested control of the GOP
from Bush Sr. in 1980 has the party faced such a crossroads. And
not since Reagan have the Republicans had a leader who attracts
support with the magnetism of a McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time somebody put in a good word for `negative'
political campaigning,'' wheezed the Journal Thursday in a pathetic
attempt to justify the fang-and-claw routine Bush's panicky
advisers cranked up as a last resort. Lose in South Carolina, they
know, and their man starts trickling sawdust into his cowboy boots.
</P>
<P>
   It's a win-at-any-cost strategy, and it betrays a resounding
lack of confidence in the core message of Bush's candidacy. What's
the message? Where is the rationale? What does this guy stand for?
Is America ready to elect somebody based on pedigree and little
else? Are we ready to elect a president who scolds the incumbent
for having ``drug his feet'' on missile defense?
</P>
<P>
   No one enjoys the Journal's obvious discomfiture more, I
suspect, than William Jefferson Clinton. The day after Bush Jr.
announced that there is no greater insult than being compared to
the guy who sits in the chair he covets, Clinton turned the other
cheek with exquisite timing. A reporter said, ``all of the
candidates are running against your behavior and conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton: ``Well, if I were running, I'd do that.''
</P>
<P>
   You can't blame Al Gore for the mess I got myself into, Clinton
shrugged. The man may be two quarts down in the personal popularity
department _ only 43 percent of Americans in the New York Times/CBS
poll say they like Clinton personally now _ but his job approval is
a healthy 60 percent, and his handling of the all-important economy
is a robust 73 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal's seven-year jihad against Clinton consumes more
than 1,500 printed pages in three bound volumes, the paper keeps
reminding us as it attempts to clear the bins of remaindered
editorial commentary. And who's laughing now? Bill Clinton, for
one. And maybe, Saturday night, an old Navy jet jockey named
McCain.

WILLIAM JAMES LIVED HERE _ AND IT'S GOING CONDO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``At home, I am in Elysium,'' William James said of the
magnificent four-story Cambridge, Mass. home he designed with
renowned architect William Ralph Emerson. ``I didn't know that
material comfort could do a man such inward good.''
</P>
<P>
   James, the pragmatist philosopher often called the father of
American psychology, believed in communication between the material
and spirit worlds. (So much so that he asked his brother, novelist
Henry James, to live in his Irving Street house for a year after
his death, in case William had any messages to transmit. None was
reported.) So I come bearing sad news, Professor James. 95 Irving
St. is going condo.
</P>
<P>
   But not without a struggle. The immediate square mile where
James and his descendants lived until 1968 is a white-hot nexus of
Cambridge brains and money: Abby Rockefeller is a neighbor, the
Galbraiths are a stone's throw away, as are Julia Child, Henry
Louis Gates, the Anne Bernays/Justin Kaplan writing dyad and other
eminentoes. A group of concerned neighbors and citizens is fighting
to designate the home a Cambridge landmark and put a stick in the
spokes of developer Jill Ruge, who has already gutted most of the
house and hopes to have the two luxury condominiums ready for
occupancy in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The neighbors assumed (dangerous to assume!) that the house was
landmarked, because it is listed on the National Register of
Historic Places. But only the Cambridge Historical Commission can
shield a house from extensive renovation, and until now, there was
no reason to do so. That's because after the Jameses, Harvard
professor William Estes lived there. Since he happened to be
chairman of the psychology department, the locals were confident he
wouldn't monkey around with James' beloved homestead.
</P>
<P>
   Now the monkeying has started in earnest. Ruge plans to invest
$1 million rehabbing the property, and has hired architects Miller
and Boehm to expand the house in several places and add two two-car
garages to the property. She also plans to add an elevator serving
all four floors. To be fair, she is not the first to lay hands on
the historical frame. James' descendants made extensive changes to
the home, adding two kitchens and installing a cathedral ceiling on
the third floor.
</P>
<P>
   The designs that were shown Thursday to a gathering of neighbors
are quite elegant. How much they respect James and Emerson's vision
for the home is another matter. The famous ground-floor library
with floor-to-ceiling bookcases where James wrote ``Principles of
Psychology'' will be ``punched out'' in two places, to adjoin a new
porch and a two-story addition. The fourth-floor attic room
(``flooded with warm white winter sunshine, I get a feeling of
seclusion and power which I am sure nothing on the Continent of
Europe could give me,'' is how William described that room to his
brother) will become a bedroom-bathroom-study suite.
</P>
<P>
   After Thursday's meeting, William James's grandson Michael
visited the house he was born in, for the first time in many years.
``The whole place is gutted; it's sort of depressing,'' James
reports. ``It's lost all of William's charm and heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight is on. Ruge opposes landmark status for her project.
``It's an extra layer of bureaucracy,'' she said at Thursday's
meeting. ``It's a risk.'' The neighbors suspect, with some
justification, that the commission smiles upon Ruge because she has
carried out tasteful renovations in other parts of Cambridge. After
buying the James house, Ruge discussed her plans with the
commission's staff director, Charles Sullivan. ``I didn't see
anything the commission would object to,'' Sullivan says. Why the
house wasn't landmarked years ago is anyone's guess. Sullivan
explained that the commission has had other fish to fry: ``We try
to focus where the preservation needs are greatest.''
</P>
<P>
   The neighbors have hired a lawyer to represent their petition
before the commission, which can't act on 95 Irving's landmark
status until early March. University of California-Berkeley
psychology professor William Runyan has written to both Harvard
president Neil Rudenstine and the commission, urging them to save
the house. (Harvard had an option to buy the property, which it did
not exercise.) ``The country, and the city of Cambridge, have an
obligation to do better by a central cultural figure than letting
his house be turned into a modernized condominium,'' Runyan wrote.

`WHOLE NINE YARDS' IS LONG ON ZANINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE WHOLE NINE YARDS 
Directed by: Jonathan Lynn 
Screenplay by: Mitchell Kapner 
Starring: Bruce Willis, Matthew Perry, Rosanna Arquette, Michael
Clarke Duncan, Natasha Henstridge, Amanda Peet, Kevin Pollak 
Running time: 99 minutes 
Rated: R (some sexuality/nudity and violence) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Whole Nine Yards'' is a merrily amoral comedy of hitmen.
Light on its feet and reveling in its deviousness, it stays one
step ahead of us as it gets maximum mileage out of what now must be
regarded as the underutilized comic talents of Bruce Willis and
Matthew Perry. Yes, Bruce Willis. As a hitman holed up in suburban
Montreal, on the run from a Chicago gang, his matter-of-fact
nonchalance in the face of the escalating violence that ensues and
his comic timing are double-barreled pleasures. They alone breathe
new life into an all but exhausted genre. Willis's character is so
much fun to watch that you wish he'd go back and do ``The Jackal''
over again, this time playing it for intentional laughs.
</P>
<P>
   If Willis's success stems from the economy of his performance,
Perry's derives from his most successful excursion yet into
physical comedy laced with expressions of perpetual terror. The
playing of Willis's minimalism against Perry's terror-stricken
farce drives the film. Perry's is the only character who doesn't
want somebody else dead and who isn't prepared to kill. He's a
dentist whose troubles begin when his viper of a wife (a funny,
over-the-top turn from Rosanna Arquette) keeps trying to hire
hitmen to bump him off for an insurance payoff. As soon as she
learns her new neighbor's real identity, she comes on to him,
hoping he'll do the job. Pro that he is, Jimmy wants no part of her
loose-cannon machinations. Besides, he persuades us he actually
likes the dentist. And this is long before the dentist's tools are
put to ingenious use.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the dentist's wife pressures her wimpy husband
to go to Chicago and rat out Willis's contract killer for the price
on his head. The dentist goes, but changes the game plan, or at
least feels guilty enough to confess to Willis's character, Jimmy
the Tulip, what he's done. This is really all the info Jimmy needs.
Without raising his voice, much less raising a sweat, he makes it
clear that he can take it from there. Kevin Pollak blows the accent
as the ethnic gang boss, but not enough to keep the bustle from
subsiding as he, Jimmy's estranged wife (Natasha Henstridge), and a
playfully lethal killer _ played by Michael Clarke Duncan at the
opposite end of the spectrum from his ``Green Mile'' death-row
inmate with supernatural powers _ enter the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Putting extra spin on the zaniness is Amanda Peet, as the
dentist's bouncy assistant who secretly longs to become a
professional hitwoman and can't believe she's about to meet the
legendary Jimmy. She's hot-wired into the buoyancy that sustains
the entire film and lifts it over what by now are the pretty
threadbare conventions of the genre. The whacks are there in
abundance, but so, fortunately, is a nonstop wackiness that makes
``The Whole Nine Yards'' a bright crowd-pleaser with a clever
script that finds ways to put a new face on its old moves and push
them around the track one more time. In a mostly dreary month,
generally relegated to serving as a dumping ground for films, ``The
Whole Nine Yards'' goes the distance.

B-GRADE `PITCH BLACK' HAS ITS BRIGHT SPOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
PITCH BLACK 
Directed by: David Twohy 
Sreenplay by: Twohy, Jim &AMP; Ken Wheat 
Starring: Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell, Cole Hauser, Keith David,
Lewis Fitz-Gerald, Claudia Black, Rhiana Griffith 
Running time: 107 minutes 
Rated: R (sci-fi violence and gore, and for language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those aliens! They're back again in ``Pitch Black,'' although,
strictly speaking, we're the aliens, given that in the film a
spaceship of earthlings crash-lands on another planet. Like
``Aliens,'' the so-so ``Pitch Black'' calls itself sci-fi, but it's
basically an old dark-house thriller. The crashed spacecraft and
soon the planet itself become the hunting ground for the much
stronger, faster, and more carnivorous creatures who live there.
They suggest giant bats with the horned head of a triceratops. They
fly in shrieking swarms, but only at night. It seems they can't
take the light on the planet that's ferociously hot by day, lit, as
it is, by three suns. But at night, look out.
</P>
<P>
   When night becomes nonstop for a while, thanks to an eclipse,
the survivors' troubles escalate. The film basically consists of
watching the space travelers get picked off one by one, despite
their best efforts to wave lights and torches at the menacing
creatures, and guessing who'll be left at the end, when they may or
may not find a way to repair the ship and blast off. Like the
flying flesh-eaters, the suspense comes and goes and the
interpersonal clashes are pretty perfunctory. And the film's
derivative flavor is heightened by the presence of a brave
Sigourney Weaver-like pilot, played by Radha Mitchell, a standout a
couple of years ago in ``High Art,'' who brings to her performance
here an intensity unmatched by the writing.
</P>
<P>
   Characterization is not the film's strong point, but then it's
difficult to say what is. Vying for top-dog status among the male
survivors are Vin Diesel's convicted murderer and Cole Hauser's
cop. Despite the suspicion in which he's bathed, Diesel's character
emerges as the sympathetic one, Mitchell's as the most compelling.
The buffed Diesel (also starring in ``Boiler Room'') puts the most
faceting on his role. While ``Pitch Black'' will never make his or
anyone else's greatest-hits reel, neither will it do any career
damage. This production, filmed in Australia, reminds us how rich
that country is in the kind of barren landscape so well suited to
sci-fi. But the fear it generates is less than primal. It's barely
intermittent, reminding us that the B-movie is still very much with
us.

MCCAIN TRIES TO STRETCH THE DEFINITION OF REPUBLICAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ He is trying, as a top aide put it, to build
the base of the South Carolina Republican Party ``beyond the
country club.'' And that effort has taken Senator John McCain to
places and settings where GOP candidates are seldom seen.
</P>
<P>
   To the grounds of a Columbia synagogue, for instance _ a rare
bit of outreach for a Republican candidate here. And to a huge
Clemson University rally featuring thousands of students, strobe
lights, and booming rock music.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the new Republican Party,'' McCain political director
John Weaver, ecstatic, shouted to a companion over the din.
</P>
<P>
   With interest in the race high, both sides are suggesting that
the turnout Saturday could be as high as 400,000. In the 1996 GOP
primary here, a lively contest between Bob Dole and Patrick
Buchanan, 276,000 voters came to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Because South Carolina has no party registration, any eligible
voter in the state can cast a ballot. McCain's victory in New
Hampshire earlier this month was fueled by an enormous turnout by
independents, and his aides say that if the total vote in South
Carolina exceeds 400,000, McCain will be a winner again.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's state communications director, Tucker Eskew, said
Thursday the Bush campaign was not troubled by the prospect of a
big turnout. ``In 1994, the Republicans here turned out 400,000 in
a gubernatorial primary, so our votes are there to get.''
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts say that Bush can expect to beat McCain 2 to 1
among Republicans _ a projection that the McCain campaign does not
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   But with interest in the Democratic presidential race receding
to the back pages, it is conceivable that many Democrats who like
McCain's style may be willing to forgo their own historically
inconsequential primary next month in order to vote in the
Republican primary. No one questions that thousands of independents
will also come out.
</P>
<P>
   In his campaign appearances, McCain has been talking of building
a new Republican Party while criticizing the existing GOP. ``This
party I love and cherish has lost its way,'' he told a large
audience gathered under a tent outside Beth Shalom Synagogue
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally in Newberry the next day, McCain described Abraham
Lincoln, a symbol of ``inclusiveness, tolerance, and forgiveness,''
as one of his heroes. That night, he took the stage at an open-air
amphitheater on the Clemson campus to the cheers of several
thousand students and the sounds of the old rock anthem ``Louie,
Louie.'' At the end, cannons fired rounds of confetti into the sky,
obliterating a full moon, while strobe lights swept the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's appearance at the synagogue was the first visit in
memory by a Republican presidential candidate to a Jewish group in
Dixie. Although McCain said later that none of the hundreds he met
there mentioned Bob Jones University to him, Bush's visit to the
white Protestant fundamentalist institution earlier this month is
believed to have aroused the indignation of many Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The political animosity between the Jewish community in South
Carolina and the religious right is more than 20 years old. One
McCain supporter said it dated to 1978, when Carroll Campbell, a
Republican leader, defeated the Jewish mayor of Greenville, Max
Heller, in a race for a congressional seat. In that contest, Heller
was undermined by a whispering campaign about his faith.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll went on to be a two-term governor and his organization
is providing the backbone of the Bush campaign. This year, the
Texas governor is following a pattern his father, George Bush, used
successfully in the 1988 primary, speaking at Bob Jones University
and appealing to hard-core conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's advisers say Bush is fighting an old war, failing to
reckon with the state's new demographics. In the years since that
famous primary, which served as a ``firewall'' against the advance
of his opponents, a half-million new residents have moved to the
state, changing the complexion of South Carolina from a rural,
conservative stronghold to a prosperous landscape with booming
businesses and sprawling suburbs. A moderate Democrat, Jim Hodges,
was elected governor 15 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign is trapped in a time warp, said Weaver.
Despite Bush's advantage among Republicans, he insisted that McCain
``is in good shape.''

<HEADLINE>
NEARLY A YEAR LATER, STILL NO PROGRESS ON GUN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a couple of months, it will be a year since two enraged
teenage boys in Littleton, Colo., raced through Columbine High
School to gun to death 12 students, a teacher, and then themselves
in a 16-minute rampage. But Columbine does not yet matter.
</P>
<P>
   Two individuals could not have killed so many people so fast, in
nearly one a minute, without a very efficient, artificial means
such as a bomb or gun. Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris had both, but
with their bombs poorly constructed and detonating inconsistently,
it was the guns that created the carnage.
</P>
<P>
   It was a miracle that far more students did not die, given that
Klebold fired 55 shots alone from his Tec-9 semi-automatic handgun.
``It would have been worse than Oklahoma City,'' said Jefferson
County Sheriff's sergeant Randy West. ``Much worse. I don't even
want to think about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Klebold and Harris chose guns because they were so easy to get.
All four guns used in the massacre were purchased for the two
underage killers by friends at gun shows, the easiest place to
purchase lethal weapons without having to undergo Brady Bill
background checks. The guns were so easy to get that Littleton
District Attorney David Thomas said, ``Guns are everywhere. You can
buy them on the street. You get them anywhere you want. You can
steal them. They are readily available. You can go to gun shows.
You can have your friends go to gun shows if you're underage.
They're very easy to acquire.''
</P>
<P>
   After all the tears and presidential and vice presidential
visits to Littleton and after all the decrying of the sources of
violence, from entertainment to guns, you would think that we would
have done something by now to decrease the chances of another
Columbine happening again. Only in America could you have this much
carnage only to have absolutely nothing happen.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Republican-led Senate, the shadow government of
the National Rifle Association, which opposes virtually all
restraints on gun ownership and gun proliferation, stalled any new
meaningful gun-control measures. Congress has yet to break a
deadlock over waiting periods to purchase guns, let alone deal with
proliferation in a nation where there is nearly a gun for every
person and where gun violence far exceeds that of any other
developed country in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Colorado, of all places, added a final insult. Despite
the horror at its feet, despite pleas for compromise from Governor
Bill Owens, normally a pro-NRA Republican, and despite a Rocky
Mountain News poll that showed that 94 percent of adults wanted to
close the loophole on gun show background checks, the state
Legislature House Appropriations Committee killed a measure that
would have closed that loophole.
</P>
<P>
   Several Colorado gun shop owners candidly say they sell more
guns at gun shows than in their own private shops. Nationally, 40
percent of guns are sold by unlicensed dealers and private sellers
who need not do background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the popularity of gun shows, one federally
licensed gun shop owner was quoted last week in the Denver Post as
saying: ``How many gun shops have 6,000 to 8,000 people come
through their doors every day of the week?''
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates in Colorado, including Tom Mauser, one of
the parents of one of the students killed at Columbine, say they
will try to put the loophole issue on a ballot initiative. ``If
they won't do it in the halls of the Legislature, we'll do it in
the streets,'' Mauser said.
</P>
<P>
   With the NRA having already lobbied successfully to get several
state legislatures to pass laws preventing their cities from suing
gun manufacturers, gun control indeed may have to be won in the
streets. That we are still at this point in America speaks of an
incredible, uninterrupted acceptance of gun violence and an
unfathomable indifference to death.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after the Colorado legislators kept open the
loopholes, two Columbine High School sweethearts were shot to death
at a subway shop within sight of the school. Last week in
Washington, D.C., two more sweethearts, one an honor student and
the other a star athlete, were murdered in a drive-by shooting that
may have been related to a scuffle after a basketball game.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths of those students were enough to move President
Clinton to say Wednesday that ``Guns in the wrong hands continue to
claim too many lives.'' Of course, Clinton, in seven years in
office, has done more hand wringing than arm twisting on guns,
wasting more time moaning about ``senseless'' acts instead of using
his bully pulpit to force meaningful gun legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, D.C., for instance, 15 public school students
have been killed by gunfire this school year, the same body count
as at Columbine last April. Yet there is no persistent political
soul searching and no resolve on guns.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths in D.C. do not yet matter. The deaths at Columbine do
not yet matter. The right to make bullet holes is still more
important than the need to close loopholes. We are tempting fate to
indeed deliver us something worse than Oklahoma City. Much worse.

STAPLES' QUEST: B2B 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Staples Inc., the $7 billion retailer of office supplies, is
about to launch some new ads for its online business, Staples.com,
with the tag line of ``Hey, you don't have to run out.''
</P>
<P>
   A 30-second TV ad set to begin airing Monday stars a
small-business owner, the Staples target audience. The businessman
is so absent-minded that he forgets his bride is waiting at the
altar. But thanks to Staples.com's e-mail reminder service, he
never forgets to order office supplies before they run out.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Web, a customer never has to run out to a store.
And thanks to the e-mail reminder, a customer never has to risk
running out of office supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Order anything anytime, anywhere, with overnight delivery,'' a
voice-over says. ``Staples.com. Hey, you don't have to run out.''
</P>
<P>
   The spot has the same quirky tone as the long-running series of
Staples ads with the theme of ``Yeah, we've got that.'' Those ads
were created by Cliff Freeman &AMP; Partners of New York, which worked
with Staples's in-house ad agency to produce the new ad for
Staples.com.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second installment of Staples.com's first marketing
campaign. In the fall, an ad ran urging small-business customers to
make Staples.com their online office manager.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Hey, you don't have to run out'' TV ad is the next step in
a national awareness campaign for the Web site that will use
everything from radio and print ads to online advertising,
billboards, direct mail, and ``guerrilla marketing,'' said Kelly
Mahoney, chief marketing officer for Staples.com.
</P>
<P>
   A retailer that expands its business online may have some
marketing advantages over a so-called pure-play dot-com, a retailer
that sells only on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To create awareness, many pure-plays have spent heavily on
mass-media campaigns in recent months, in some cases sinking most
of their investors' money into marketing.
</P>
<P>
   But when a retailer with traditional stores offer its products
online, it has the luxury of building on an existing brand name. As
a result, its advertising costs can be much lower than those for a
pure-play dot-com.
</P>
<P>
   High marketing costs may be one reason why Wall Street has
shifted its attention from pure-play retailers that sell to
consumers to so-called business-to-business e-commerce ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a consumer retail Web site, which must market to a mass
audience, so-called B2B Web sites often deal with a small universe
of customers. That can mean far lower marketing costs, and lower
costs may be one reason why B2B e-commerce ventures are in vogue
with investors.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney declined to say how much Staples will spend this year to
market its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to building a successful dot-com brand begins with
knowing your customer, utilizing highly targeted marketing
vehicles, integrating your message cohesively across all channels,
and executing against a well thought-out investment strategy,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   As Staples gets out the message that its products are available
in stores, in catalogs, and on the Web _ and that customers can
order products through whatever channel is most convenient _ the
dot-com ad campaign fits into a larger strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to make itself an invaluable part of the lives of its
small-business customers, the Framingham, Mass. company has
expanded beyond office products to offer such services as
high-speed Internet access and payroll management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, you don't have to run out'' may not have a long run as a
tag line, though. Staples.com plans to introduce additional tag
lines this year, Mahoney said.

MARTIN ENDURES A PAINFUL ROAD BACK FROM SPINAL FUSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Leave it to Mark Martin to describe the
quality of his life before he underwent spinal fusion surgery last
November. ``The last few years I just wasn't happy because my life
had a restrictor plate on it that was just choking the sweet part
right out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course. His aching back was like a restrictor plate.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's degenerative lumbar back problem, which he suffered
quietly for years, made last season's NASCAR Winston Cup campaign a
grueling 34-race torture test. It had precisely the same effect on
his racing career and lifestyle that a carburetor restrictor plate
had on the motor of his No. 6 Valvoline Ford Taurus. It severely
limited his capacity to generate the necessary horsepower to keep
up with his hectic schedule.
</P>
<P>
   And so Martin did what came so naturally to him: He toughed it
out.
</P>
<P>
   Considered a steely-tough customer by many of his peers, Martin
showed just how indomitable his spirit really was last July after
he crashed while practicing for the Pepsi 400 at Daytona
International Speedway. He fractured his left wrist and rib and
injured his left knee, but he still got back into a backup car the
next night, started third, and finished 17th _ aching back and all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never raced in that kind of pain before, or since _ and
never will again, I'm sure,'' said Martin, who is hoping for a
pain-free run when NASCAR's 2000 season gets under way Sunday with
the 42d Daytona 500. ``The wrist hurt really bad in that race. And
I didn't know my knee was broke until Wednesday. I had surgery on
it after the MRI came back.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, Martin showed up with his Roush Racing team the
following week at New Hampshire International Speedway in Loudon,
N.H. And though his pit crew had to gingerly lift him through the
window of his car and delicately strap him into his driver's seat,
Martin still rallied from a 37th starting spot (his worst of the
season) to finish sixth in the Jiffy Lube 300.
</P>
<P>
   He wound up the season third in the Winston Cup standings after
winning two races, completing 9,899 of a possible 10,187 laps,
earning $3,509,744. All of which came without the benefit of
NASCAR's new shock and spring rule that, Martin said, would have
made his car ride more like a passenger car down the interstate and
less like ``a truck with stiff springs and shocks and no load on
it, going over railroad tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, aching back and all, Martin rode out his rough ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at him,'' Ricky Rudd said of the 5-foot-6-inch,
150-pound Martin, ``and he's probably one of the smallest in
stature out there, but there's no one tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin shrugs off such talk. He chose to defer to another person
when it came to his definition of toughness.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad,'' said Martin, referring to his father, Julian, who
was killed in a plane crash two years ago. ``You look (tough) up in
the dictionary and his picture is beside it. I could never measure
up to my dad. There were certain things about him that weren't
admirable, but he instilled a lot of the qualities I had from
either watching him or listening to his advice.''
</P>
<P>
   But nothing his father ever taught him could have prepared
Martin for the difficult recovery process he faced. Still, it was
his devotion to a physically fit lifestyle (``to the point that I
was almost nutty about it,'' he said) that accelerated his
recuperation.
</P>
<P>
   A back patient undergoing the kind of procedure he went through
normally would take three months before beginning physical therapy.
Martin started in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He was up on his feet the day of the surgery. The second day he
walked out his hospital room, down the hall and back. On the third
day, he made the same trip, only without a walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``My doctors, Chuck Kollmer and Chuck Steadman, and my physical
therapists, we all had a goal to be bulletproof for the Daytona 500
in February,'' said Martin, who spent the first six weeks following
the surgery lying on his back for almost 22 hours a day. ``Six
weeks after the surgery, I wasn't so sure that we'd be ready or
not, but the progress really came on fast from there on out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Martin was hardly a couch potato.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that really seemed to get me through was going up to
my office every day and getting a phone, an address book, and a
notebook pad and laying on my stomach on the couch at the office
and taking care of business,'' said Martin. ``The days passed a lot
faster that way, and there was an enormous amount of stuff taking
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the business side of the racing world seemed to continue on
even though I wasn't going places,'' he added. ``At least the
wheels didn't stop turning.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for one instant. While Martin recuperated, his crew chief,
Jimmy Fennig, feverishly worked to prepare the redesigned 2000 Ford
Taurus. When Martin climbed back into the car for the first time
during a Jan. 21 test session at Daytona, ``It was pretty tender
and it was a little bit edgy getting in the car,'' he said. ``The
difference now is that it doesn't bother me to get in or out of the
car or drive.''
</P>
<P>
   That much was evident when he drew the pole for the Bud Shootout
and was running a solid race. But Martin was thrown off track by a
pit row accident in which he ran over his own jackman, Mike Ehret,
who emerged with nothing more than a right leg bruise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was devastated,'' said Martin. ``My guys trust me with their
lives and I breached that trust, in my mind . . . I was sick about
it, and it took me a while to feel better. Thank goodness Mike
wasn't seriously injured, otherwise I would still be moping.''
</P>
<P>
   But on this day, as he stood leaning against a wall in the Benny
Kahn infield press room at Daytona, Martin was beaming. His was
back behind the wheel of his race car. And he was, for the first
time in a long time, feeling no pain. The wince people had once
mistaken as a forced grin had now been replaced by a genuine smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I am 15 years younger than before the surgery,''
said the 41-year-old Martin. ``The pain I had is 100 percent gone.
I feel like a brand new person. I can't tell you how much it was
robbing my quality of life _ way more than I ever knew.''

VENTURE CAPITAL BOOM MAKES FED'S JOB TOUGHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone knows that venture capitalists are getting rich and
that they are creating great wealth for the entrepreneurs whose
companies they fund.
</P>
<P>
   But what is the impact of the incredible explosion of venture
capital on the rest of us? What does it mean for the American
economy that we now start new companies with venture money rather
than with the more traditional vehicles of bank financing and
corporate investment?
</P>
<P>
   Are we better off? Worse off? Does anyone know?
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, no one knows much. The venture boom is a
relatively new phenomenon. In 1995, about $6 billion in venture
money was invested in the United States. Last year, the figure was
$35 billion. This year, the number will undoubtedly rise
dramatically again.
</P>
<P>
   Still, based on what they have seen so far, economists and
academics are enthusiastic about the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a major portion of the good performance of the economy
in the late 1990s is due to venture funds,'' said Robert Litan,
director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Like other fans, Litan thinks venture capital has unleashed the
creative powers of the American economy and turned a traditional
economy into a risk-taking, high-powered one. Along with the bigger
capital markets, it has given the US a major competitive advantage
in the race to the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we turn our scarce savings into productive investments
is the envy of the world,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist of RFA
Dismal Sciences, a forecasting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Why is the venture method of financing so superior to what came
before? The experts cite three key advantages. They say venture
funding:
</P>
<P>
   --Goes to work faster. Think about the classic way of starting a
business. You use your own money to get going and when you reach a
certain size you go to the bank for a loan. The bank wants to see
some proven results and preferably some collateral as well.
</P>
<P>
   In the venture model, money is committed right at the beginning
based on an idea and a business plan. If bank money flows in a
trickle, venture money rushes in like a flood. ``We are throwing a
lot more money at new ideas and some of these ideas will flower
into substantial businesses,'' said Samuel Hayes, an emeritus
professor at the Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   --Delivers more bang for the buck. According to William Sahlman,
another Harvard Business School professor, the old economy depended
heavily on big corporations for the development of new products. A
Xerox or an IBM would launch a major project, put big dollars
behind it and hope something good came out at the other end.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists, by contrast, run what Sahlman calls
``staged experiments.'' They give out a chunk of money and then
wait to see the results. If the results are promising they commit
more dollars; if not, the venture capitalists say goodbye and cut
their losses. The upshot: a system that produces far more winners
than the traditional system, said Sahlman. ``I think we have
increased the chance of commercial success by a factor of five or
six,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   --Creates more powerful incentives. When Sycamore Networks went
public last fall, its founders were worth close to $3 billion at
the end of the first day of trading. Sycamore may be an extreme
case but the point is clear: In a venture-backed company there is a
chance for key players to get very rich. ``You can benefit in
proportion to the value you create,'' said Sahlman. That pot of
gold at the end of the rainbow is a powerful incentive to work hard
to make the new company a success.
</P>
<P>
   So what about the downside? Along with our new riches have we
created new problems too?
</P>
<P>
   Allen Sinai can think of one. The chief economist at Primark
Decision Economics, Sinai points out that when banks were the
principal source of lending to new companies, the Federal Reserve
controlled the process. If the Fed wanted to slow the economy, it
hiked interest rates, bank loans dried up and the economy ground to
a halt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today with so much of the funding for economic activity coming
from outside the banking system it may be a lot harder for the Fed
to slow things down,'' said Sinai.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge facing the Fed was evident Thursday after Chairman
Alan Greenspan warned about the need to slow the economy to combat
inflation. Old economy stocks fell on the news; technology stocks
rose, as if to say to Greenspan: ``Your interest rate hikes can't
hurt us. We have our own source of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Others worry that venture funding may lend itself to the
creation of bubbles. The fear is that the flood of money into
narrow niches _ technology companies collected 90 percent of all
venture money last year _ will lead to overcapacity, a great number
of failed companies and possibly a bust at the end. ``We could go
from euphoria to pessimism,'' said Zandi.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, we may need to go through a market correction or even a
recession before we know how well a venture-fed economy performs
over the long haul. In the meantime, most people think the new
finance system is just swell.
</P>
<P>
   Said Robert Litan of Brookings, ``I can't think of many bad
things to say about it.''

KIRK DOUGLAS CAN'T SAVE LACKLUSTER `DIAMONDS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
DIAMONDS 
Directed by: John Asher 
Screenplay by: Allan Aaron Katz 
Starring: Kirk Douglas, Dan Aykroyd, Corbin Allred, Jenny McCarthy,
Kurt Fuller, Lauren Bacall 
Running time: 91 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (sexual content, drug use and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kirk Douglas has always been a battler, and one's heart goes out
to the 83-year-old actor and recovering stroke victim playing a
retired boxer and recovering stroke victim in ``Diamonds.'' There's
a bravery and a dignity in his old welterweight champ trying to get
things right with his family that quite transcends the mawkish
sentimentality in ``Diamonds.'' The film is sadly unworthy of
Douglas, with an albatross of a script disfigured by rigging so
blatant, and on such a thudding level of manipulative obviousness,
that it squanders some solid work on a mission impossible.
</P>
<P>
   It starts with Douglas's Harry Agensky, known in his boxing days
as ``The Polish Prince,'' living in the house of a grown son in
western Canada. In between exercises designed to fully restore his
powers of speech, he persuades his other son, Dan Aykroyd's
newspaperman from San Jose, to drive him and the unhappy
18-year-old (Corbin Allred's Michael) to whom they are,
respectively, grandfather and father, to Reno. The old man claims
he hid a cache of diamonds _ payoff for throwing a fight _ in a
mobster's house there 50 years ago. So they set out in a red
convertible, with the top permanently down, for one of those road
movies that has bonding experience written all over it.
</P>
<P>
   When they get to Reno, and find only the house's foundation
still standing, Harry refuses to end his search, perhaps sensing
the script's eagerness to hand him the info he needs in a series of
convenient coincidences. The first involves meeting up with an old
ring adversary when they stop at a combination motel and Elvis
shrine en route. The second, which shatters utterly any remaining
wisps of credibility, comes when Harry insists that they check into
one of Nevada's legalized bordellos to usher his grandson into sex.
The one he chooses not only has whores with hearts of gold, it even
has a madam with a heart of gold, played with immense poise by
Lauren Bacall, Douglas's costar in ``Young Man With a Horn''
(1950).
</P>
<P>
   Between them, they almost persuade us that their banal
greeting-card exchanges actually occupy the realm of human speech.
But, facing odds greater than any casino's, they can do only so
much with this embarrassingly candied episode of prostitution as
family therapy. One of the very few things the film does right is
to include clips from Douglas's ``Champion'' (1949), the boxing
movie that made him a star as a stop-at-nothing fighter. Diamonds
may be a girl's best friend, but ``Diamonds'' is not Kirk Douglas's
best friend. I refuse to accept it as his swan song. Here's hoping
he returns in a film more worthy of what he obviously still has to
offer.

SABERHAGEN PULLS AN ARM OUT OF THE HAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Bret Saberhagen knows how to take off his
right arm and put it back on again. I would be willing to bet on
that. It's probably one of his party tricks. I can see the pitcher
removing his arm, sneaking behind the person holding the hors
d'oeuvres and announcing (as he extends the detachable arm), ``I'll
take one of those.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you believe in magic? If you don't, you will after listening
to this guy. He was in the Red Sox' clubhouse Thursday wearing a
T-shirt from the Brooklyn Fire Department. He should have been
sporting surgical scrubs. His right arm has been operated on three
times, including once on Nov. 5. After each procedure, he stays low
for a while and then comes up throwing. He knows about cortisones
and MRIs. He can chat you up on anti-inflammatories. He tells you
that the first time his arm went out, it felt like a bottle
exploding in his body. He can describe the dye doctors sometimes
shoot into weak shoulders, as if the dye is a satellite that will
bring back information from another galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   Believe me, the man's arm is transcendent. I watched him throw
for 10 minutes Thursday and was full of questions. Did he order the
arm from Amazon.com? Does it beep when he is going through airport
security? Does he smile when he hears the Smashing Pumpkins sing,
``Disarm''? Does he ever sucker anyone by asking them to arm
wrestle?
</P>
<P>
   It turns out I wasn't the only one with questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you feel, man?'' catcher Scott Hatteberg said when he
saw Saberhagen. ``Strong like a bull?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Strong,'' Saberhagen replied, ``but not like a bull.''
</P>
<P>
   Beautiful. He is magical and humble.
</P>
<P>
   You should have seen the look on pitching coach Joe Kerrigan's
face when he talked with Saberhagen. Kerrigan wasn't shocked by
what he saw, because he knows Saberhagen has been throwing for a
month (he has an indoor facility in his Long Island home). He was
more surprised by what he heard: Saberhagen said he wants to be one
of the five starters who breaks camp with the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you tell these guys that you wanted to be one of the five
guys?'' Kerrigan asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said it was a goal,'' Saberhagen corrected.
</P>
<P>
   They were both smiling at that point. It was time for Kerrigan
to tease the man who spent most of last season as the Sox' No. 2
starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you bring extra summer clothes?'' the coach said with a
grin. ``You're going to need the extra summer clothes here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going north . . . You can't leave me here,'' Saberhagen
said.
</P>
<P>
   They laughed. They both know an April return for Saberhagen
would be miraculous. During last October's playoffs, the
righthander said he had discomfort in his right shoulder. When it
was time for surgery, he found that the ``discomfort'' existed
because a tendon was 90 percent torn. That means Saberhagen pitched
against the Yankees and Indians with his arm, literally, falling
apart.
</P>
<P>
   It's very easy to say he won't be back until after the All-Star
break. And that's ambitious. There is all this medical evidence
that suggests a quick recovery is unlikely. But that information is
compiled on those who have average arms. Saberhagen doesn't. He
certainly doesn't have the average approach to surgery; he makes it
an interactive process.
</P>
<P>
   ``My doctor (David Altchek) usually gives me valium before
surgery to relax me,'' Saberhagen said. ``But (in November) he told
me he wasn't going to give me enough to, you know, knock me out; he
wanted to ask me some questions.''
</P>
<P>
   So there was Saberhagen, on valium, answering his doctor's
questions during surgery. When the doctor saw the tear, he asked
the pitcher, ``Do you want me to fix it the right way or do you
want me to mend it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fix it,'' the not-so-drowsy patient responded.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor fixed it and also created more space in Saberhagen's
shoulder. Thursday, he said he hasn't felt better in the previous
five years. Since Saberhagen has won personal (Cy Young) and team
(World Series) awards, you wonder why he continues to do this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I can't do it forever,'' he said. ``Unlike writers _
you guys can write and report for many years _ there is going to be
a time when I can't do this anymore.'' Later he would say, without
sounding arrogant, ``Pitching is the one thing in life that I can
do very well.''
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the amazing elements of his story: Surgery has
made him a less durable pitcher, not an ineffective one. ``I'm very
fortunate to be pitching in this era,'' he said. ``If this had
happened 10 years ago, I wouldn't be pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people will say that modern medicine made Saberhagen's
tale possible. I don't believe it. I swear I've seen this story on
one of those old ``Star Trek'' episodes. But then, Saberhagen is an
original. He has even redefined sports language. If Saberhagen
begins the season with the Sox, someone will ask him how he managed
to defy medicine. He will respond with old cliches that he has
filled with new meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arm strength,'' he will say with a wink. ``You know, I've got
a really strong arm.''

KIWIS, ITALIANS ARE SET TO KICK OFF CUP FINALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND _ Two 75-foot International America's Cup Class racing
yachts will line up Friday to race for the oldest trophy in sports
_ the America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The black boat festooned with logos that make it a floating
billboard belongs to Team New Zealand, which arrived at the 1986
America's Cup as the fresh-faced rookies.
</P>
<P>
   With the essence of the old team still together, the aging
defenders haven't sailed in international Cup competition since May
1995.
</P>
<P>
   That was the Cup match it swept from Paul Cayard at the wheel of
Dennis Conner's defense campaign, using Young America's boat. It
was the biggest mismatch in modern Cup history, with the Kiwis'
Black Magic winning all 25 marks and extending its lead on all 30
legs. The Kiwis never broke a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   The silver boat bears a decorative red stripe on its bow, but no
commercial logos. Instead of the heavy sponsorship needed to float
the Kiwi boats, the Italian boats and team are the wholly owned
property of Patrizio Bertelli, the billionaire founder of the Prada
fashion empire.
</P>
<P>
   Both camps built two boats _ the Kiwis have no names; Prada's
are called Luna Rossa (``Red Moon''). Even to the casual eye, the
boats are quite different.
</P>
<P>
   Prada is a straight arrow with a long, fine bow with a gradual
entry, while New Zealand has a ``chin,'' under the bow to extend
the water line, a shallow overhang, and a new ``millennium'' highly
bendable rig with three spreaders instead of five.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried some of these new things,'' said skipper Russell
Coutts at a prerace briefing Thursday. ``A lot of people say that
can't be the right keel or position of the wings. That was a little
disconcerting from our point of view because what we were doing
could have been so wrong. But we'll just have to wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   From the appearance of their boats to the style of their
organizations, the two rivals could not be more different. New
Zealand, a syndicate run by the old team of Sir Peter Blake, Brad
Butterworth, Alan Sephton, Tom Schnackenberg, and Coutts, backed by
heavy fund-raising, makes endless appeals to Kiwi pride and
patriotism to get behind the defense effort.
</P>
<P>
   There's hardly a soul in the Kiwi population of 3 million who
does not own a black and yellow Line 7 team shirt, hat, or
Blake-inspired red socks (the most famous symbolic wear in the
nation).
</P>
<P>
   Prada, on the other hand, refuses to sell team gear. Unwilling
to ``cheapen'' the team image, Prada does not sell anything in town
with the sailing trademark on it. Red-striped gray T-shirts, either
purloined or traded by sailors, are the premium fashion statement
among the Cuppies here.
</P>
<P>
   The budgets differ as well. The $55 million the Italians admit
to spending for this three-year campaign is the largest war chest
in Auckland. Some competitors claim the figure is closer to double
that. After all, didn't Prada construct an entire boat-building
yard in Punta Ala as a leap-off point for its campaign?
</P>
<P>
   Bertelli, who passionately wants to win the America's Cup, has
spared no expense, and the sailing team says often that it wants
for absolutely nothing. Its focus is entirely on sailing and
winning the America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelli's passion frequently spills over into the earshot of
the Auckland waterfront. Sailors from nearby compounds say they
hear him loudly berating the team when it loses. Most famous was
the loss in the semifinals to Stars &AMP; Stripes. When the team came
back from Hauraki Gulf that night, Bertelli was out on the lawn
voicing his unhappiness: ``I've spent $80 million on this campaign
and you just got beat by a one-boat program!''
</P>
<P>
   The Prada team laughs this off. It is just the Italian way,
members say. The Bertelli way. He is passionate. He gets it out and
it's over.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand's budget is kept somewhat secretive. It is certainly
far less than Prada's, perhaps half.
</P>
<P>
   The nationwide red socks campaign actually began in San Diego
when the Kiwis wore them to support Blake, who wore red socks in
his round-the-world sailing exploits.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, though, the red socks are a team fund-raiser.
In mid-January, the 300,000 pairs sold had raised half the money
needed for Team New Zealand's new mast _ $600,000. But even this
innocent campaign hit a contentious note when the New Zealand
Herald ran an expose pointing out that the Kiwi red socks, bought
by residents of one of the most famous wool-producing countries on
earth, were actually made in Korea. It was considered only a minor
row.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gave us a little trouble,'' said Sephton, syndicate
spokesman, ``but we're past that. We had to do what was best for
the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kiwis are also staying quiet about a report in the New
Zealand Herald last week that on the eve of America's Cup 30, a
rift had broken out between management _ Blake _ and the sailing
team led by Coutts. Next to money, the issues in dispute were
unspecified, and the official party line expressed by Blake was: We
are family. Sometimes families have squabbles, then resolve them.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the team problems, Coutts said: ``That's a
ridiculous question. Let's move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Having suffered a serious collapse in 1992 that took it out of a
lead on the way to the Louis Vuitton Cup, New Zealand is painfully
aware of the need for team unity.
</P>
<P>
   If Conner's observation that teams at this level must be able to
sail the IACC boats to within 96 percent of their potential, then
Prada and the Kiwis get equally high marks. Racing for their second
America's Cup, New Zealand is a well-tuned machine that can operate
the boats with efficiency in every phase _ upwind and down.
</P>
<P>
   Prada's team, which has been practicing steadily since fall
1997, is smoothly efficient. Like Team New Zealand, it makes few
``unforced'' errors.
</P>
<P>
   The variables on both sides will come down to the two most
important men in the afterguard. For the Kiwis, it's Coutts and
Butterworth; for Prada, Francesco de Angelis and Torben Grael.
</P>
<P>
   Coutts helmed Black Magic to New Zealand's first Cup five years
ago, and in the meantime has won honors as the top match racer on
the world circuit. In '95, with Blake on the boat trimming, Coutts
did not have to act as skipper, and this year will be a major
difference.
</P>
<P>
   De Angelis, while a well-decorated international sailor, got a
late start. He first sailed as a 15-year-old and never sailed a
match race before 1997. He had just joined Cayard's Whitbread team
when Bertelli called him to be part of the Prada team. He was
surprised at being asked to helm Luna Rossa.
</P>
<P>
   According to Prada sailing coach Rod Davis, after making some of
the most elementary mistakes, de Angelis began to come along
quickly. He was joined by Brazilian Grael as tactician, and the
team began to compete in the early Cup rounds with such a fast
boat, it seemed never to have to engage in any heavy match race
``street fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They know how to stay in front once they get there,'' said
Cayard before the challenger finals. ``But we'll see how they do
under pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Down three races to four in the series with Cayard, the world
found out the de Angelis/Grael afterguard had enough grace under
pressure to beat AmericaOne.
</P>
<P>
   Grael, a 39-year-old Star World Champion, believes that Prada
holds the edge because: ``Having sailed the Louis Vuitton Cup
against such a variety of opponents gives us a good overall picture
for the racing on Hauraki Gulf. We are ready for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Grael and de Angelis study endless videos as they prepare for
opponents, and the Kiwis are no exception. They say they know how
Coutts and Butterworth sail prestarts, and how they react to
offensive and defensive situations. Just what they know, however,
they are not sharing.
</P>
<P>
   Butterworth compares himself to a chess player who must rely on
his memory of past patterns of competitive situations. But in his
home waters of Auckland, he said, he also has to know when to be
innovative and take chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some races fall into a pattern that you can recognize,'' said
Butterworth. ``But it is more difficult here in Auckland. The wind
is so very shifty and the pressure varies across the course.
Deciding which side of the course to choose is sometimes the most
important part of a race.''
</P>
<P>
   Grael agrees, but his race assessment is more textbook: ``If you
have steady wind and a good start and get a good margin, then you
can cover and it's unlikely you're going to lose the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you have unsteady winds, especially light and shifty,
and you're very close to your opponent, if you just try and cover
you're going to be out of phase with the windshifts, and you'll
lose the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Conditions forecast for Friday's Race 1: light and shifty.
According to Butterworth, who recalls being confident before the
Kiwi's shellacking in San Diego, ``This year we know nothing. We
don't have a clue. We'll know a lot more after the first three
minutes side by side.''

MARCH MADNESS COULD BRING A FREE-FOR-ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may be a bit premature, but with March closing in, it's time
to start thinking about the NCAA tournament, with seeds, brackets,
and the other devices of March Madness.
</P>
<P>
   This season, perhaps more than any other in recent years, it's
not so much how good you are, but where you will play that could
determine the NCAA champion. Being in the right bracket will mean
as much as getting a proper seed.
</P>
<P>
   There are no super teams out there, although Cincinnati seems to
be the consensus pick as a step above everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   The Bearcats are almost a mortal lock on being the No. 1 seed in
the Midwest, with Duke probably close to being No. 1 in the East.
</P>
<P>
   After that, it's a free-for-all, with several very good to good
teams able to emerge at the Final Four in Indianapolis the first
weekend in April.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford and Arizona seem the probable No. 1 seeds right now.
But Syracuse, Michigan State, Tennessee, and someone like Indiana
could make a last-minute surge.
</P>
<P>
   The sleeper team we like is Temple, which plays Cincinnati
Sunday in what could be a Final Four preview, provided the two
teams are not in the same region.
</P>
<P>
   Things are different in March. Coaches coach, players play.
Coaches and players also get exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to UConn. The Huskies are in a February funk
right now. They generally are this time of year. But because coach
Jim Calhoun's team won the national championship a year ago, the
bar has been set higher than it has ever been for the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   Is UConn as good as it was a year ago? No. Are they going to
continue to flop around as they have been the last few weeks?
Again, no. Forget what you saw at Notre Dame. Forget what you saw
at Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   UConn always shows up in March. That is what makes Calhoun such
a good coach. He knows how to bring his teams to certain emotional
levels.
</P>
<P>
   The odds against the Huskies winning the national championship
are growing. The odds against the Huskies even winning the Big East
tournament are also higher than they have been.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are a UConn fan, don't give up on the Huskies just
yet. They still look like the elite team in the Big East when you
talk about the potential for going furthest in the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   There may come a time to bury the Huskies and call them
underachievers or whatever else, but that time hasn't come yet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Big East in hot seat
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Controversy continues to swirl around the Big East, ranging from
the poor taste of the Notre Dame fans who bombarded UConn guard
Khalid El-Amin with comments to the ongoing controversy surrounding
St. John's and various misdeeds that may or may not have happened.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame apologized for its fans and promised it won't happen
again. And that's fine, but one thing seems clear: When it comes to
being clever about your verbal abuse, the NCAA should put in a
rule. Let Duke and Stanford handle the clever stuff. Both of those
student sections have proven they can be clever and funny _ and
they, too, cross the line on occasion. Everyone else should just
shut up.
</P>
<P>
   As for St. John's, a lesson should already be learned by
everyone involved. It makes no sense to bombard the NCAA with
verbal insults. The organization, wrong or right, still has the
power to make life miserable. And likening it to the Gestapo, as
was suggested last week, is only going to raise tempers of the
people in Indianapolis who will now probably go into St. John's
looking to find something wrong . . . This has been a bad year for
the Atlantic 10. Other than Temple, no one seems sure of an NCAA
bid if they don't win the A 10 tournament. Dayton is pretty close,
but don't look for the A 10 to get more than two bids this season,
barring some extraordinary upsets . . . With Virginia Tech heading
to the Big East in basketball next season, the A 10 is looking for
teams to expand. Richmond seems to be the prime target . . . Word
also has it that Holy Cross will jump from the Patriot League to
the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference next season, with Navy as a
possible partner . . . You want a hotbed of college basketball this
season? Try the Sooner State, where Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, and
Tulsa won 60 of their first 68 games . . . Miami's loss to
Providence at home Wednesday night was a killer in terms of the
Canes' hopes for making it to the NCAA. The Canes are still in the
hunt, but if it comes down to decision time, losing to Providence
at home is not going to help matters.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cincy atop this week's RPI
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Everyone seems to be talking about the RPI (ratings percentage
index), which the NCAA selection committee uses as a key tool in
deciding who gets into the tournament and how high they should be
seeded. Here is this week's Top 10 RPI. 1) Cincinnati; 2) Kentucky;
3) Tennessee; 4) Stanford; 5) Arizona; 6) Duke; 7) Texas; 8)
Maryland; 9) Syracuse; 10) Indiana. Incredibly, Kent from the
Mid-American Conference had a higher RPI ranking (24) than Ohio
State (29) or Michigan State (28) from the Big 10 . . . Ohio
State's Ken Johnson is one of the reasons the Buckeyes have a
chance to reach the Final Four. Johnson has blocked at least five
shots in eight of 11 Big Ten games . . . Another is guard Scoonie
Penn, who is averaging 1.95 turnovers and 34.1 minutes per game . .
. Duke is winning with young talent. The Blue Devils are leading
the Atlantic Coast Conference in freshmen starts (46) . . . Things
are getting testy in the A 10 with coaches getting fined and
players getting suspended for fighting and criticizing officials .
. . Only Penn (Ivy), Utah State (Big West), and Cincinnati
(Conference USA) remain unbeaten in conference play . . . Clemson
may be having a mediocre season, but the same can't be said for
Will Solomon, who leads the ACC in scoring with a 21.3 points per
game average. He also is the only player in the league to score in
double figures each game he has played this season . . . North
Carolina is starting to make a move with five wins in its last six
games. One of the keys is guard Ed Cota, who has posted 24 assists
and only four turnovers in his last two games . . . UCLA is in
seventh place in the Pac-10 and the pressure is mounting on coach
Steve Lavin. Even if the Bruins win five of their last eight games,
they could still be a bubble team in the NCAA tournament, although
five wins would give them 18 victories overall and a .500 record in
the conference, which should be good enough . . . What's with
Kansas? The Jayhawks lost to Iowa State in Lawrence for the first
time since 1982 Wednesday night and look ordinary at best. Iowa
State, on the other end, is very good. The Cyclones are 22-3 and
two wins shy of their school record for wins . . . America East's
decision to let the conference tournament remain in Delaware for
the next couple of years is an indication that the league's agenda
is not necessarily an even shot for all of its teams, but strictly
financial. Delaware does a great job in running the tournament, but
the Blue Hens have become too good in recent years and playing all
the games on its home court (if Delaware finishes first) is a huge
reason. Why not move it around? The Palestra in Philadelphia would
be a great spot _ small but filled with tradition. If the America
East people talked to the A 10 people, they could link up the two
tournaments for an entire week of college basketball in
Philadelphia. But that probably makes too much sense.

BOOK REPORTEDLY TARGETS OFFICE SEXUAL HARASSMENT AT ESPN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think women have come a long way in television sports
journalism? That may be the image being projected by the networks,
but a big cloud is starting to form over ESPN headquarters in
Bristol, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The Sports Business Journal, a popular Web site within the
industry, reported comments made by Keith Olbermann on the Winstar
Radio Network about an upcoming book, ``ESPN: The Uncensored
History.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Olbermann, the former ESPN anchor now working for
Fox, the book is causing a stir among ESPN brass.
</P>
<P>
   Olbermann said that he was ``told that it blows the lid off
(the) Bristol (operation), especially about one skeleton in one
closet _ sexual harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Olbermann, an outspoken critic of ESPN, said that he had not
read the unfinished manuscript by New York Times sports reporter
Mike Freeman but heard that the industry buzz was based on a
handful of pages.
</P>
<P>
   An ESPN spokesman said they would not comment on ``conjecture.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman worked at the Globe in 1989 and was the first to report
on the harassment endured by then Boston Herald sports reporter
Lisa Olson in the Patriots' locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman was unavailable for comment.

   Lots of college basketball this weekend. ABC has a Saturday
doubleheader with the Duke-North Carolina State starting 1:30 p.m.
Brent Musburger and Dick Vitale call the ACC game, while Mike
Tirico and Len Elmore work the 3:30 p.m. UConn-Miami game. ABC has
Sunday's 1:30 p.m. game between Temple and Cincinnati, and ESPN
will carry UConn-St. John's at 7 p.m. Monday.

<P>
   Three ESPN analysts have already named their Final Four
selections. Digger Phelps and Jay Bilas have Stanford, Cincinnati,
Duke, and Michigan State. ESPN.com's Andy Katz picks Stanford,
Cincinnati, Michigan State, and Temple.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are frighteningly powerful,'' Bilas said about the
Cincinnati Bearcats. ``Bob Huggins may have done his best coaching
job with this group. They look fresh, they play well together, and
they play as hard as any team in the country.''

   ``Boiler Room'' wants to update ``Wall Street'' and ``Glengarry

echoing them. It would have had more sting if it had made a serious
stab at indicting the greed at the heart of the respectable part of
the market instead of concentrating on a blatantly larcenous chop
shop that makes its driven young pitchmen rich by fleecing suckers
with worthless stocks. But it's lively enough at the start as
Giovanni Ribisi's Seth Davis, a natural entrepreneur running an
illegal casino out of his house in Queens, is lured into what he
thinks is a respectable job as a stockbroker in an effort to gain
the perpetually withheld approval of his emotionally stingy father,
a judge (Ron Rifkin) who does more judging at home than on the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't know that the film's writer-director, Ben Younger,
has a music video background, you'd guess it soon enough as he
plunges us into the hyper world of stock pushers. The quick cuts of
the first part of the film suggest an MTV ``Wall Street,'' complete
with a rap soundtrack. White guys on the make and in a hurry don't
push crack cocaine, the film says, they push dubious stocks,
hooking customers on their own greed. The film is upfront about its
antecedents. At one point, four of the young brokers sit on a sofa,
watching a videocassette of ``Wall Street,'' reciting lines from
memory. Later, the firm's motivational cattle-prod, unfurled with
entertaining pyrotechnics by Ben Affleck, openly alludes to his
model, Alec Baldwin's ramrod in ``Glengarry Glen Ross,'' as he
whips them into attack-dog mode while simultaneously tempting them
with all the expensive new toys they'll acquire.
</P>
<P>
   Although the father-son stuff is a little tired, Rifkin freshens
it by projecting believable torments and conflicts of his own. As
the boiler room Candide, Ribisi proves he can carry a film with his
fine-tuned sentience. His ``Saving Private Ryan'' colleague, Vin
Diesel, emerges with improbable sympathy, too, as a dumb lug who
doesn't ask questions and is content to swim with the sharks, but
who also has heart. Conversely, Nicky Katt does the job of
injecting conflict as Seth's nominal superior, Greg, jealous of
Seth's natural phone-scam talents and of his apparent romantic
success with Nia Long who threw Greg over. The romance with Long's
secretary character goes nowhere, unfortunately, and perhaps
inevitably, in the outrageously misogynistic world of the film.
</P>
<P>
   If the performances buoy up a film that frankly runs out of
steam about half way through, and doesn't so much seem to end as
simply stop, Younger nevertheless deserves credit for mustering an
ensemble quality that convincingly projects the sort of foxhole
camaraderie the guys develop as they blow off steam after hours.
And the on-the-job rush feels like the real thing. For a while,
``Boiler Room'' actually lives up to its hype as ``Wall Street'' on
crack as the assaultive telemarketing crackles through the cold
blues and grays of the work space. Certainly the over-the-top first
half plays better than the soul-searching second half. But Oliver
Stone and David Mamet hover over ``Boiler Room'' a bit more vividly
than Younger should have allowed them to. ``Boiler Room'' is
derivative and flawed. But it does throw off a few sparks.

`HANGING UP' IS A FLIMSY SISTER ACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
HANGING UP 
Directed by: Diane Keaton 
Screenplay by: Delia Ephron &AMP; Nora Ephron (based on Delia Ephron's
book) 
Starring: Meg Ryan, Diane Keaton, Lisa Kudrow, Walter Matthau, Adam
Arkin, Cloris Leachman, Jesse James 
Running time: 92 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (language and some sex-related material) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Hanging Up'' is a comedy based on the premise that father not
only doesn't know best, he doesn't know much of anything anymore,
except how to get his daughters on the phone for his daily
attention fix. It showcases Meg Ryan at her ragamuffin best as the
middle sister who gets stuck with most of the work of caring for an
aging father in decline. But it gives decidedly less opportunity to
Diane Keaton (who directed) as the steamrolling older sister and
Lisa Kudrow as the younger sibling whose life keeps changing
direction. There are times when it feels like something arising
from a real family dynamic. But considering that its script is
partly based on the experiences of writer Delia Epron, who wrote
the screenplay with her sister, Nora, ``Hanging Up'' isn't the film
you keep feeling it could have been.
</P>
<P>
   In it, the only constants are change, chaos, motion, and phone
calls, especially the latter. All three sisters are overloaded, and
their cell phones keep breaking up, sometimes with suspicious
convenience. Enter Ryan's classic case of middle-child syndrome,
embodied in one of her most disheveled and appealing performances,
being pulled in three different directions by the demands of her
career as a party planner, her husband and young son, and now her
rapidly unraveling but more garrulous than ever father. As played
by that skilled farceur Walter Matthau, he's a smart and even
loving geezer, but he's also something of a one-note character and
an embarrassment besides, especially when he takes advantage of the
slack that people cut him to slip into the role of dirty old man.
</P>
<P>
   Still, we don't need the film's flashbacks to make us realize
why they love him. It's right there in his smile. Ryan's character
Eve is not only the most appealing, she's the only one who's fully
dimensioned among these three sisters, whose bonds are stretched to
tragicomic breaking points that cry out for, but don't get, the
touch of a California Chekhov. She's also something of a
guilt-prone patsy. She's flanked on one side by Keaton's selfish
careerist, Georgia, and on the other by Kudrow's soap opera
actress, Maddy, whose show affords her so little dramatic scope
that she resorts to generating a lot of self-made difficulties to
exercise her need for dramatics.
</P>
<P>
   There's a sweetness in their concern as they tie themselves in
knots over the phone, figuratively speaking. They're warm and
clever and know each other well enough to know they're never going
to be let off the hook for long, even if Eve winds up shouldering
most of the load as their busy lives become busier when their
father requires hospitalization. They also can be more than a
little wearing, especially Matthau's demanding old pain, who
realizes he's nearing the end and isn't above milking it. The film
certainly captures the maddening aspects of a jam-packed list of
obligations and a family that talks out everything exhaustively _
and exhaustingly _ before doing anything.
</P>
<P>
   If director Keaton's intention was to mirror the chaos of the
frazzled-nerve lives the sisters lead, she succeeds abundantly. She
not only gives the actors space, she sometimes gives them too much
space. Ryan has no problem filling hers with adorableness. It's
amusing to watch Keaton work some of her usual hesitations into a
character who's insensitive to her sisters and everybody else. And
Kudrow snatches moments of appeal from her clearly disadvantaged
character. Matthau's delinquent dad soon makes us wish the film had
gone the less-is-more route with him. ``Hanging Up'' is, finally,
too scattered and insubstantial to be as funny and moving as it
could have been. Although, to be fair, being scattered is what it's
about.

YO LA TENGO PRIZES ITS INDEPENDENCE

<P>
   Most rock bands yearn to get on the inside of the music
business, but the members of Yo La Tengo are happy to be on the
fringes. It's safer and more creative there, with no accountants
telling you what to do, they've found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time I read an article about the record business these
days, it doesn't make me sorry that we're not more entrenched in
it,'' says Ira Kaplan, a former rock critic who plays guitar with
Yo La Tengo _ one of the most beloved, low-key indie bands of its
generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always seemed as if we were removed from the world of major
labels _ and now the minuses of that world seem to outweigh the
pluses pretty clearly,'' says Kaplan.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan, drummer Georgia Hubley (his wife), and bassist James
McNew continue to march to a different beat with their
just-released 10th album, ``And Then Nothing Turned Itself
Inside-Out.'' While some songs rock, such as the guitar-noisy
``Cherry Chapstick,'' the overall mood is more mellow than usual _
and nearly ambient in a few songs such as the understated,
Eno-esque ``Everyday'' and the laid-back ``Tired Hippo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always had elements of an ambient sound, but I think the
balance tipped on this record,'' says Kaplan.
</P>
<P>
   But, in typical Yo La Tengo fashion, the softer tempos aren't
the result of any careful strategizing. The truth is, the band
simply has a new rehearsal space that provides a calmer setting
than before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new practice space is quieter and much more comfortable,''
Kaplan says of having moved the band's base of operations from
Hoboken, N.J., to Jersey City. ``It's warmer in the winter and
cooler in the summer where we are now _ and that's affected the
music. As for our old rehearsal space, they tore it down and put
condominiums on it.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter. The Yo La Tengo folks are adaptable creatures, though
the last thing they do is adapt to current musical trends. At a
time when rock 'n' roll is getting louder and more abrasive, Yo La
Tengo, which has been-there, done-that, is headed the other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, the music is slower, but I think our approach hasn't
varied that much,'' says Kaplan. ``We still approach music with an
openness that allows the sounds to change. It's hard to put into
words, but we try to keep it on an intuitive level.''
</P>
<P>
   The trio should be making more noise in concert, however. For
this tour, the group has expanded to a quintet after adding
Superchunk's Mac McCaughan and former Clean guitarist David Kilgour
from New Zealand. Because of this, expect the group to add some
songs that they haven't been able to play before in concert.

   New Boston record label: ``I was the one who wasn't riding in
the white limousine blowing the horn,'' says Michael Jonzun, joking
good-naturedly about his brother, Maurice Starr. The latter was the
flamboyant producer/writer for local stars New Edition and New Kids
on the Block, but Jonzun was right there helping him out and
co-writing some songs. Starr has since moved to Atlanta, but Jonzun
has continued to keep offices in Boston and Falmouth, Mass. Jonzun
just teamed up with John Lay (former manager of Squeeze, and also a
local resident) to form Jonzun Entertainment. It's a new record
label with a distribution deal with Lightyear Entertainment, which
in turn is distributed by WEA (Warner-Elektra-Atlantic). The
label's first artist is a teen act named Lil' D'Anthony (Jonzun's
13-year-old son), whose new CD, ``Show World'' (due in May),
represents ``Motown meets Frankie Lymon and Jackie Wilson,'' says
Jonzun. Also in May, the label plans to issue a new single of
Leslie West and Mountain's ``Mississippi Queen,'' with West and
Corky Laing from Mountain teaming up with Boston rapper Ed O.G.
That could be wild.

&HT;     BALLOT MEASURE WOULD WAIVE MOST HOME PROPERTY TAXES FOR 5
YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LEE HUBBARD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ This city has its share of noteworthy
politicians and issues. A former prostitute almost won a spot on
the Board of Supervisors. And who can forget both of Willie Brown's
mayoral elections? In the March 7 primary election, another bizarre
measure will again push San Francisco into the national spotlight.
That is Proposition F, the ``Bayview-Hunters Point Reparations''
measure.
</P>
<P>
   Prop. F would waive all home property taxes for five years on
houses valued at less than $500,000 in District 10, which is
dominated by the Bayview and Hunters Point in the southeast corner
of the city. It would exempt small businesses from paying the
city's payroll tax for five years. And it would force the mayor and
the Board of Supervisors to allocate $150 million for a fund to
create jobs for residents in the district.
</P>
<P>
   An elected council would control this money. According to Carlos
Petroni, who wrote the initiative, it is aimed at stopping
gentrification. He said this measure doesn't hurt anyone and would
benefit people of all races _ numbering 60,000 to 70,000 _ in an
underdeveloped area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to keep people of color in San Francisco, and this is
an economic and social solution,`` he said.
</P>
<P>
   While his intentions may be good, Petroni's motives and his
measure need to be explored. Prop. F has a missionary aspect that
is troubling. It is a good example of a top-down,
outside-the-community approach to public policy.
</P>
<P>
   Petroni, publisher of the left-wing Frontlines newspaper, is a
man who doesn't live, work or, to my knowledge, have any
affiliation with the Bayview-Hunters Point community.
</P>
<P>
   The topic of reparations piques my interest. I support Michigan
Rep. John Conyers' bill to study the concept of reparations to
blacks for the 200 plus years they were in bondage in America and
for the 100 plus years of de facto slavery through Jim Crow laws.
</P>
<P>
   But Prop. F shouldn't be mentioned in the same breath as
reparations to blacks for generations of slavery. That deals with
black suffering; F deals with local developmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Petroni has skillfully localized a national issue _ reparations
_ that has helped to fuel one of the largest mass movements among
blacks in the last 20 years. Why else would he call it the
``Reparations Act''? No one in the city would argue that
Bayview-Hunters Point hasn't been an underserved community that, in
a sense, seems separate from San Francisco. But gentrification
would not stop if Prop. F were to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Mission District, which has been an area of renters,
Bayview-Hunters Point has one of the highest rates of home
ownership in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The people selling houses in Bayview-Hunters Point are cashing
out of an investment. No one, for the most part, is being evicted,
as is the case in the Mission. This is something the pied pipers of
gentrification haven't comprehended.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the people moving out of Bayview-Hunters Point aren't
selling to white yuppies. They are selling largely to another
minority. The Bayview-Hunters Point population, which has been
predominantly African American since the 1950s, is now close to 30
percent Asian American.
</P>
<P>
   Prop. F would cause neighborhood fractionalization.
</P>
<P>
   It is also short on specifics. For example, what is a ``small
business''? Is a $1 million business a small business?
</P>
<P>
   The measure also says that the elected council that would
control the $150 million jobs fund must represent the demographic
and ethnic diversity of the neighborhood. Now, how does one
guarantee this? Prop. F is an example of someone pushing an agenda
on a particular community.
</P>
<P>
   But despite its flaws, which are many, one of the things I like
about the measure is that it will put Bayview-Hunters Point on the
radar screen for San Francisco voters. And when people look, they
will find a community that wants to shine just like West Portal,
the Marina or any of the other residential sections in the city.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by the Hunters Point Environmental Health Project found
that economic development was the No. 1 issue for Bayview-Hunters
Point residents, with an emphasis on quality shops and
community-owned businesses. While Mayor Brown deserves credit for
trying to integrate the Bayview into the city with city services,
this isn't enough. It has just whetted people's appetites.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has talked about positive change coming, but people
want to see results. That is why I wouldn't be surprised if support
for Prop. F grows. And this will cause some interesting movements
in San Francisco politics, even though the measure will probably
fail at the ballot box.

 &HT;    ALLEGATIONS OF RUSSIAN RIGHTS ABUSES CONTINUE,
 &HT;    (600&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ International human rights activists and independent
observers reacted with marked skepticism Friday to acting Russian
President Vladimir Putin's naming of a point man to investigate
alleged abuses, calling the act a public relations ploy ahead of
next month's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Putin Thursday named Vladimir Kalamanov, the head of Russia's
migration service, to look into mounting allegations of torture,
rape and executions by Russian soldiers against Chechen civilians.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kalamanov himself, has come under fire in international
aid circles for his track record during the Chechen war.
</P>
<P>
   The migration service has denied Chechen civilians fleeing
fighting entry to camps located in neighboring regions, and has cut
food supplies to some of the estimated 200,000 refugees allegedly
to force them to return to Chechnya. This violates United Nations
guidelines for the treatment of internally displaced persons.
</P>
<P>
   The source of the stories alleging abuse by Russian soldiers
come from refugees. Their tales, told in interviews to journalists
and aid officials from shacks and homes in neighboring Ingushetia
where they have taken shelter, are chilling in their detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``For weeks Russian authorities have issued blanket denials
about abuses by their forces, instead of investigating abuses and
bringing those responsible to justice,'' said Peter Bouckaert, a
spokesman for Human Rights Watch, from the New York-based rights
group's headquarters in Nazran, Russia _ the town where the Chechen
refugee camps are located.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the face of the lack of action on past abuses, we must meet
any new action by the Russian authorities with a degree of
skepticism,'' Bouckaert added.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been heavily criticized by Human Rights Watch, the
International Red Cross, European Union and others for not allowing
international observers _ including journalists _ into the war zone
to independently verify the accounts alleged by refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, seen as the architect of the six-month-old offensive
against Chechen rebels, has watched political star rise during the
war, and now is widely considered the run-away favorite to become
Russia's next president _ if scandal doesn't envelope him first.
</P>
<P>
   Russians are increasingly questioning the military's war
strategy in light of revelations this week concerning what Russia
calls ``filtration camps,'' which are located within Chechnya and
used to winnow rebel fighters from civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Bouckaert said he has four separate eyewitness accounts from
Chechen men who said they were repeatedly beaten and tortured in
Russian filtration camps before being able to buy their way out or
escaping.
</P>
<P>
   Radio Liberty, the U.S.-backed media outlet that broadcasts in
the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, has evidence that
Andrei Babitsky, a reporter working for the service who has been
missing for one month, was held briefly by the Russians in one of
the detention centers, located in the village of Chernokozovo.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has issued no statement on the human rights subject. The
news of Kalamanov's new appointment came in a press release from
the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``How a minister will denounce the government he is working for
is a question that remains to be seen,'' said political analyst
Vyscheslav Nikonov, the director of the Moscow-based think tank
Fund Politika. ``This is an adequate response from a domestic PR
point of view. It would have been better, I think, from a human
rights point of view to have an outsider named to the role.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin spokesman for Chechnya, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, admits
to the existence of the detention camps, but in an interview
Thursday he categorically denied beatings or torture took place
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this is a lie,'' Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin has previously brushed aside requests for
international access to Chechnya from the United States, the United
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe. The Red Cross has been denied
access to Chechen prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Yastrzhembsky said international monitors from the EU would be
allowed into the detention camps to see the situation for
themselves, but he gave no date of a possible visit. The Council of
Europe's human rights commissioner, Alvaro Gil-Robles, is due to
arrive in Moscow on Feb. 24, according to the Associated Press.

   SC-PRIMARY _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush faced the independent
voter challenge in New Hampshire and lost. They went for McCain. In
South Carolina, he faces an arguably greater challenge since the
primary is completely open, meaning Democrats can cross over to
vote in the Republican race and Democrats have no primary of their
own today. What will these voters do? And what are South Carolina
voters saying on the day they're set to cast their ballots? Has the
negative campaigning taken its toll? An advancer on Saturday's
primary. (Heath, Austin American-Statesman). 25-30.

SO YOU WANNA BE A BLACK MILLIONAIRE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has e-mail changed the way we communicate, but it has
also become a repository of modern-day junk mail.
</P>
<P>
   From offers to ``watch the hottest babes'' on porn sites to
get-rich-quick schemes to ``sweet'' little stories I shouldn't go
through the day without, my mailbox is overflowing most days.
</P>
<P>
   If I read every ``this is cute'' thingie I got, I wouldn't have
a job. So I do what any good steward of time would do: point, click
and delete.
</P>
<P>
   But there are days when I get an e-mail or two that strikes my
fancy and sends me into convulsions. I hate that, particularly when
I'm at work trying to impress my boss.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, I am sitting at my desk recently when I get this
e-mail: ``Who Wants to Be a Black Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   I scroll down and the file says, ``For all those who have seen
the show `Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,' I'm sure you have
wondered what the show would be like if it related to
African-Americans/black people?''
</P>
<P>
   The thought hadn't crossed my mind, but I scroll down a little
farther.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' my e-mail friend continues, ``here's your chance to
play `Who Wants to Be a Black Millionaire.' ''
</P>
<P>
   I scroll down some more and you know what, had I been on
television, I'd be laughing all the way to the bank. Well, maybe
not. Last I heard, the company that insures the popular ABC game
show is suing to get out of its contract, saying the questions are
too easy and the contestants too smart.
</P>
<P>
   Which might explain why I aced the digital version of ``Who
Wants to Be a Black Millionaire.'' Here are some sample questions.
See how you do:
</P>
<P>
   For $100, someone who is jealous is often referred to as what?
</P>
<P>
   a. Buster
</P>

 &HT;    HARLEM DEBATE GIVES DEMOCRATS A CHANCE TO SHINE
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Feb. 20.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bill Bradley and Vice President Al Gore, overshadowed
for weeks by the hard-fought Republican campaign in South Carolina,
get a moment in the spotlight Monday with a debate in one of their
own key battlegrounds.
</P>
<P>
   The event at Harlem's fabled Apollo Theatre will the Democrats'
first encounter since late January in New Hampshire. It is expected
to focus on racial issues and urban policy.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is ``a pivotal moment for us,'' said Jacques DeGraff,
the manager of Bradley's New York campaign.
</P>
<P>
   This is Bradley's home court. Most people believe that if he
can't beat Gore here, the rest of the presidential political season
will be just playing for pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New York primary is very important to my campaign,''
Bradley acknowledged in upstate New York last week. ``I clearly
have to win a number of states on March 7.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is his best shot,'' said Joe Lacey, a property manager
for BMG Entertainment, one night last week as he watched a hockey
game at Virgil's. The restaurant and bar is just a few blocks from
Madison Square Garden, where Bradley built so much of his legend as
he played for pro basketball's New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Bradley, this is his best place,'' agreed Lee Miringoff,
director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion at Marist
College and one of New York's most respected political analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not necessarily a good place,'' Miringoff quickly added,
because independents, one of the most important parts of Bradley's
political coalition, are prevented from voting in New York's
Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   New York's 243 delegates are the second biggest prize after
California's 367 in the ``Super Tuesday'' jackpot of Democratic
presidential voting March 7. Sixteen states will hold primaries,
caucuses or conventions on that day to award 1,386 delegates to
either Gore or Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   In none of those states, though, is Bradley better known than in
New York, or better positioned to score his first victory against
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   For 10 years, Bradley was a star forward for the Knicks. And for
18 years after his basketball career, he represented next-door
neighbor New Jersey in the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, in New York, he doesn't have to compete against as
strong a party structure as he faces in California, where every
statewide Democratic official, from Gov. Gray Davis on down, has
endorsed Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the more liberal positions Bradley has taken on
health care, gun control and abortion are in keeping with the
political traditions of New York.
</P>
<P>
   One measure of Bradley's appeal in the state is ZIP code 10021,
New York City's Upper East Side, home to many of the city's
investment bankers, lawyers, doctors, Internet moguls and news
media and television stars.
</P>
<P>
   ZIP code 10021 has been one of Bradley's best sources of
campaign contributions. He collected $691,095 from 10021. Gore got
only $460,980 even though his daughter, Karenna, and her family
live in 10021.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, in the weeks since his narrow victory over Bradley in
the New Hampshire primary, has piled up endorsements from party
officials, issue groups, labor unions and African American clergy
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The unprecedented endorsement of Gore last week by National
Abortion Rights Action League reflected the challenge Bradley
faces. NARAL chose Gore, who rated high with anti-abortion groups
early in his career, over Bradley, who has supported abortion
rights throughout his political career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a disgraceful moment for NARAL and what it symbolizes
is the entrenched power of Washington,'' said Ronnie Eldridge, a
local Democratic official who is supporting Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   The gay-rights Human Rights Campaign, which also usually remains
neutral in Democratic primaries, also endorsed Gore.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Gore and Bradley were even in New York. The latest
poll, on Feb. 10, put Gore ahead 56-32. Nationally, Democrats favor
Gore 64-25 over Bradley, according to the New York Times/CBS News
poll published last week.
</P>
<P>
   New York's African American community, 22 percent of the vote in
Democratic primaries, represents a big part of Bradley's hope to
close that gap.
</P>
<P>
   But it is questionable whether the Apollo Theatre event, like
the TV ads featuring basketball legend Michael Jordan or the
endorsement of film-maker Spike Lee, will change many votes among
African Americans in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of New York's big-name African American
politicians support Gore, including Reps. Charles Rangel and Major
Owens, State Comptroller Carl McCall, Manhattan Borough President
Virginia Fields and former Mayor David Dinkins.
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen black ministers also back Gore, and
generating enthusiasm is ``where the church can play a great role''
in the primary, said McCall.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, in two of the final three Sundays before the March
7 vote, Gore will be campaigning in African American churches in
New York, including one joint appearance with first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton, a U.S. Senate candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the country may have ``Clinton fatigue,'' but in the
African American community, ``there is no stronger calling card
than the Clinton name,'' said Miringoff. And Gore is using it to
full advantage here.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and Gore have both courted the Rev. Al Sharpton, one of
New York's more controversial figures. But Gore has done so less
publicly, meeting privately with him last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Since that meeting, held at Gore's daughter's home, Sharpton has
toned down some of his criticism of the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore has a good record working with blacks in Washington, but
he's not addressed the race issue in this campaign,'' Sharpton said
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said he would announce his endorsement after the Apollo
Theatre debate.

SHOCKING VISITS TO THE REAL WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Feb. 20) 
(jt) 
 By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Starting in the management training program at Chase
Manhattan Bank didn't turn out exactly the way one 29-year-old
Upper East Sider expected.
</P>
<P>
   In the five years since she'd graduated from college, she had
been supported in Manhattan by her family and spent her days
volunteering as an organizer of parties for charities.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly, among her friends, it was no longer acceptable for
young adults not to work. All the glittering Park Avenue princesses
were touting their serious day jobs. It was chic to have a career.
The young woman asked her father, a prominent financier, to help
find her a position. Daddy, as she refers to him, talked to golfing
friends at the Round Hill country club in Greenwich, Conn., and
within two weeks she was in at the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The chicness wore off fast.
</P>
<P>
   When she started, in March 1998, supervisors informed her of the
dress code: replace those puffy Agnes B. skirts and Chanel flats
with dark suits, classic pumps with one-inch heels, with stockings.
She complied, though she found stockings ``especially middle
class.'' She was told to limit personal calls, and so she made her
party plans after work. She obeyed what she called the bank's
``silly'' rules, but then summer approached and she informed her
supervisor that her family traditionally took a three-month
vacation in the south of France.
</P>
<P>
   She was told she could have one week off.
</P>
<P>
   ``One week?'' said the woman (whose fear of ridicule led her to
ask for anonymity). ``That was so ridiculous. That's not even
enough time to shop.''
</P>
<P>
   When she returned to the office three months later, in
mid-September, she found, not surprisingly, that she was out of a
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire experience was a shock,'' the woman said the other
day. ``I had never been around that many middle-class people all in
one room. It was dreadful. They were mean and jealous and expected
me to miss out on all our family fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Pity the adult children of the modern leisure class.
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK, don't pity them _ but at least try to see it their way
for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   Raised with unlimited charge-card privileges and BMW's for their
16th birthdays, they knew early on that they would not have to work
for a living. Their parents bought them apartments when they turned
21 and endowed trust funds to provide for cash flow. The
post-debutantes thought nothing of flying to London for a party in
a suite at Claridge's, or to a disco on Ibiza, or drifting through
India for a Merchant &AMP; Ivory month.
</P>
<P>
   But now it has become socially unacceptable not to work, no
matter how much money your parents have. Young women dread being
stuck with the label ``socialite,'' or worse, as middle-aged
1980s-vintage ``ladies who lunch.'' It is the same for men. Just a
generation ago, about half the members of the Racquet &AMP; Tennis
Club, the Park Avenue bastion of male privilege, listed
``gentleman'' or ``sportsman'' as their occupations, members say;
now, there are precious few who fit those descriptions. And most of
them hide it.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, despite the fashion for careers, many children of
extreme privilege can't seem to hack it. They lack the drive and
the discipline of their hungrier peers. They get frustrated easily
when confronted with setbacks, and grow angry at the need to defer
immediate pleasures. They job-hop, throw tantrums and have a tough
time relating to people who come from different backgrounds (and
almost everybody does).
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the kids I grew up with are still stuck doing the
same things they were doing in high school _ partying every night,
not working terribly hard, traveling a lot,'' said Noel Ashman, 29,
an owner of the nightclub Veruka, where many of his former
private-school buddies congregate. ``They are dressed in Prada and
Armani now and don't really worry about how they're going to wake
up for work the next morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Many have tried working, he said, ``but when it gets difficult,
they won't stick it out because they don't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Tara Peters, 28, an artist, attended private schools in
Manhattan and, after college, moved to Paris for six years, before
returning to New York. ``It's unacceptable to say you don't work,''
she said. ``Work is a definition on how you spend your time. If you
don't work, and you don't have to work, you eventually look like a
dummy who lunches.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Buhl, 30, who grew up in New York and Switzerland, has
briefly held jobs as a temp at a stock brokerage in Boston and as a
trainee at a brokerage in London. He left, he said, when he became
bored. Most recently he worked for an uncle on building sites in
Palm Beach. That, too, he found tedious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked it in the beginning, but it got a little boring,
repetitive,'' he said hesitantly. ``I didn't like the people. There
was nothing wrong with them, but there are a lot of rednecks down
there.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I got tired of Palm Beach. It got dull.''
</P>
<P>
   Buhl returned to New York, where he has many friends who are
supported by their families. They call themselves artists, he said,
or hop from job to job. ``Some of my friends are brats,'' he said.
``Some are just looking for new and exciting experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Buhl's father, Henry Buhl, a retired mutual fund manager and a
philanthropist, laments that all three of his grown children lack
career ambitions. ``None of them seem to have any work ethic,'' he
said. A second son, 35, has had three jobs in a year and lives to
crew on sailboats. His daughter, 36, lives in Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   They have many contemporaries in the same position. ``This is a
flighty group from New York and Switzerland,'' Henry Buhl said, ``I
won't mention names, but there are so many kids of rich people who
are given too much money and too much freedom and are `cool' and
haven't been handled properly.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   To force his own children to take responsibility, Buhl said, he
stopped giving them money a few years ago, but they have
independent incomes from their grandparents. The family patriarch,
Louis Mendelssohn, was a wealthy architect and builder in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Buhl, who said he did not come into family money until
later in life, worked his way up on Wall Street. Today he lives in
a 4,500-square-foot loft in SoHo, with a dome over the entry
painted to look like a Renaissance mosaic. It is no small paradox
that Buhl is the founder of the SoHo Partnership, which helps
homeless people find jobs as well as housing. Participants are paid
$6 an hour to clean the streets while being trained to dress and
speak well in interviews to win jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Buhl said his program has helped more than 200 people find
employment since 1992, but he has been unable to help his own
children. ``My kids should be in the program, but they are not
hopeless enough,'' he said. ``You have to be desperate to make my
program work.''
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that he bears some responsibility for his children's
aimlessness. ``I guess I shouldn't have give them such a high
life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard, no doubt, to work up much sympathy for this segment
of the trust-fund set, especially when so many others in their age
group are working 70-hour weeks on the lower rungs of law firms or
banks or as Internet entrepreneurs. They manage to delay
gratification on their climb to the top, which also teaches lessons
in dealing with people, both superiors and subordinates, from
diverse backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   At least one 27-year-old woman who grew up in a wealthy and
socially prominent family, on the other hand, never stayed long
enough in a sales job she took, at a corporation in Midtown, to
experience the world outside her Baccarat bubble. If she had, she
might have lost what seems to be an ingrained snobbery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to people who took four trains from God knows
where to get to work, who didn't understand that my job did not
come first,'' said the woman, who did not want to be named.
``Certainly it didn't for $37,000 a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Her immediate manager, she recounted, rolled her eyes when she
came in late, grunted when she took three-hour networking lunches
and finally put her foot down when she wanted to take an unpaid
vacation to go to the Paris couture shows. After 18 months, she
quit. She now works for her family, helping to invest its fortune.
She goes to a family office when she is so inclined and where the
employees, all on the family payroll, can't boss her around.
</P>
<P>
   Such cases may seem extreme, easy to tsk-tsk over; but a sense
of entitlement coupled with a lack of discipline is also a growing
problem for young people from less lofty strata, some
psychotherapists and child experts say. The term Affluenza has been
popularized by one therapist, Jessie H. O'Neill of Milwaukee, to
describe how values are distorted by too much money. Merrill Lynch
offers advisers who help clients teach their children the
responsibilities that come with wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pamela Sicher, a psychiatrist in private practice on the
Upper East Side, said: ``We have more and more children that are
having trouble finding personal reasons to work hard at their own
goals. Many feel that they will passively inherit, if not money, a
work life, and this type of thing tends to stifle creativity and
drive.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``A lack of focus, a lack of direction and a lack of
drive is a problem that has increased in frequency among the young
20-somethings and 30-somethings, who are now going to therapists.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert C. Elliott, an executive vice president at the Bessemer
Trust Co., which manages trusts for individuals (minimum fund: $5
million), said the latest wave of the newly wealthy is learning
from past mistakes in giving money to children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents are recognizing the potential problem and delaying the
time when their children would actually receive money in order to
not have it serve as a disincentive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After their children's educations are paid for, he said parents
now typically ``buy a house, give them money to start a business,
but don't let them get their hands on the big money.'' These
children come into their legacy in stages, at the ages of 30, 35 or
40, and some parents even require offspring to pass drug tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work ethic is hampered by access to money at too young an
age,'' Elliott said. ``It's hard for someone who has several
million dollars, which produces income of over $100,000, or so to
be interested in a job that pays $40,000.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately they become less committed to their career than
their peers, which obviously produces less success in their career
and ultimately less satisfaction with their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, trust funds have a habit of running out, especially in the
second or third generation.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Kravitz admitted that he grew up as a spoiled brat in and
around New York. His artist mother, Brenda Kravitz, and his father,
Philip L. Kravitz, the owner of a very profitable insurance
brokerage, had homes in New Jersey and off Sutton Place in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically had whatever I wanted,'' Kravitz said. That
included, during Christmas vacations in Palm Beach, his own room at
the Breakers hotel with a stocked bar, which made him popular with
the junior social set there. When he was 19, he had his own
Manhattan condominium. ``Basically I was so unruly my parents
thought it would be easier for me to have my own apartment,'' he
said. ``You know, so I wouldn't mess up the pillows.''
</P>
<P>
   He partied through college (he attended several) and kept on
partying all the way into his 30s. When he left school, he took a
job at his father's company, Kalvin Miller International, one of
the top insurance brokerages in the country. When his father sold
it, the new owners politely told him, he recalled, that he would
always have a job there but that since he didn't work hard he would
not advance far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was full of arrogance and conceit and felt there were plenty
of opportunities for me,'' Kravitz said. ``I didn't show up in the
office when I was supposed to. I was very unruly.''
</P>
<P>
   He was clubbing nightly. He recalled thinking that the norms
that guided most peoples' careers and behavior didn't apply, thanks
to the great cushion that wealth provided. ``There's a degree of
snobbery,'' he said. ``You say to yourself, `I'm different from
everyone else.' You say, `I'm better than everyone else.'''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Especially in the New York scene, there is such
tremendous affluence and you're surrounded by so many affluent
friends, you kind of think you'll always be taken care of. You feel
you have all this privilege and it's almost a right of passage that
you will succeed. You think that everything will come magically and
easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Between the ages of 23 and 28, Kravitz held four jobs. He quit
three and was fired from one. At one point he moved to London to
try developing real estate, but got discouraged and returned home.
</P>
<P>
   In moments of introspection, he recognized that he was deeply
unhappy with his inability to sustain a career, or even a long-term
relationship. He saw how the heavy use of drugs and alcohol among
his set was an attempt, as he put it, ``to medicate these awful
feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Kravitz became depressed over his lack of direction, and
considered suicide. ``My life just stopped working the way it
was,'' he said. ``I had no clue about how to focus on work. I saw
my life standing still while friends were getting married, were
getting promoted at work.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of worry for his son, his father, who died last year, had
him go work at another of company he owned, Global Risk Management,
which audits workers' compensation insurance. ``I had to grow up
and I had to learn how to work and have responsibility,'' Kravitz
said. He said he now goes to an office all day, almost every day,
got married, Now, at 33, he says he has turned his life around.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who really matter, the people who I respect,'' he
said, ``I've earned their respect now.''

WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION OFFICIAL OPTIMISTIC ABOUT CHINA'S
MEMBERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BEIJING _ The head of the World Trade Organization said Friday
that he was optimistic that China can enter the trade body this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely hopeful that negotiations will be concluded and
agreed by the various members this year,'' said Mike Moore, chief
of the trade organization, at a news conference here Friday
afternoon. Moore met with China's prime minister, Zhu Rongji, and
the foreign trade minister, Shi Guangsheng.
</P>
<P>
   Moore also made clear that China must enter the WTO before
Taiwan does. China, which considers Taiwan a renegade province, has
warned that any efforts to secure Taiwan's earlier entry would
cause a serious confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said the issue was settled in 1992 by the predecessor
organization, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which
said China would join first, then Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   A WTO official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that
Taiwan's reported fear that China, once in the body, could keep
Taiwan out, was unjustified, Reuters reported Friday. The official
said there would be a 30-day period after China ratifies its
accession before it becomes a member. During this period, the
official said, Taiwan could sign its own accession documents.
</P>
<P>
   To placate Chinese concerns about granting Taiwan national
status, the island will enter under the name ``China-Taipei,'' with
the status of a ``customs territory,'' officials of the trade group
have said.
</P>
<P>
   China still needs to reach agreements with 14 trade organization
members before it can join. It has already reached agreements with
the United States, Japan and Canada, and on Monday negotiations
with the European Union will resume here.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans are reportedly pushing to deepen the concessions
China has made to the United States in the areas of insurance,
telecommunications and automobiles, an official said. Concessions
granted to one party, like the European Union, apply to all member
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Trade officials believe that once the major economic powers
reach accords with China, the remaining countries, mainly Latin
American and Asian, will quickly come to terms.
</P>
<P>
   Two or three months of technical negotiations among member
countries are then expected at the WTO headquarters in Geneva.
Topics would include phase-in periods of new rules for China and
the elimination of non-tariff barriers not already covered.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Chinese and international trade officials are nervously watching
the congressional debate on granting China permanent normal trade
relations status, as President Clinton has proposed. A stiff battle
is expected this spring.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, China can join the WTO even if Congress refuses to
cooperate, and Congress could renew China's trade status each year.
But a negative vote in Congress on permanent trade relations would
cause uncertainty and confusion, international trade officials say,
leading China to deny benefits to the United States that it grants
to other countries, or even to delay its accession to the world
body.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Not the world's most enchanting city, Tokyo has never
looked so good as in ``100 Famous Views of Edo,'' a series of color
woodblock prints made in the mid-19th century by the Japanese
master Utagawa Hiroshige (1797-1858). The series (there are
actually 120) was begun in 1856 by the artist and ended with his
death. It includes a few post-mortem prints by his disciple
Shigenobu.
</P>
<P>
   Produced with superb craftsmanship and many stylistic
innovations, the prints celebrate a flourishing Tokyo (known as Edo
until 1868) a few years after Commodore Matthew Perry opened
isolationist Japan to the West and just before the onset of the
Meiji period, which propelled the country into modernity.
</P>
<P>
   The prints, among the best that deal with popular subject matter
in the woodblock medium known as ukiyo-e (``the floating world''),
have had a lasting effect on Western art. Their compositional
innovations have reverberated in the works of Impressionists and
Post-Impressionists, notably Monet, van Gogh and Whistler.
</P>
<P>
   A fine first-edition set, one of only six complete sets known,
was given to the Brooklyn Museum in 1930 by an all but anonymous
collector, Anna Ferris. Bound as an album, it languished largely
unnoticed before it was ``discovered'' by the department of Asian
art in 1979 and transferred to its renowned collection of Japanese
woodblock prints. The set was reproduced in a full-color catalog by
George Braziller in 1986 before its first showing at the museum in
1987.
</P>
<P>
   Now is as good a time as any, the museum figured, to display the
prints again. The current installation, roomy and well planned, was
organized by Amy G. Poster, curator of Asian art. And Braziller has
re-issued its knockout catalog, with commentary on each plate by
Henry D. Smith II, professor of Japanese history at Columbia
University, and essays by Smith and Poster.
</P>
<P>
   The catalog illustrates the prints in just about their actual
size. Still, no catalog, even Braziller's ambitious endeavor, could
capture the full flavor of these artfully composed sheets, with
subtle gradations in color, nuances of texture and other effects
that Hiroshige was able to coax from the cherry woodblock after a
lifetime of honing his talent and technical skills.
</P>
<P>
   People, trees, temples, roads, bridges, mountains, water, boats,
flora, fauna and weather animate these sometimes ebullient,
sometimes laid-back scenes. There are distant views of Mount Fuji
and a close-up of horses' behinds; serene temple compounds and the
busy patterns of women's clothes; earthlings and winged creatures
like eagles and egrets; festivals, fireworks, pageants and
performances. In the tradition of meisho, the classic literary
convention in which places of poetic association were commemorated,
each print is tuned to a season.
</P>
<P>
   The largest number of prints (42) _ is grouped under spring, by
Japanese tradition the first three months of the lunar year, a time
for celebrating the New Year and viewing floral blossoms. There are
scenes like a New Year's celebration on the slope known as
Kasumigaseki with kites dancing in the sky; two geisha returning
home tipsy past a row of cotton merchants' shops; spectators
watching the glow of dawn at a shrine.
</P>
<P>
   The most spectacular is ``Plum Estate, Kameido,'' a close-up
view of Edo's most famous tree, the ``Sleeping Dragon Plum,'' whose
drooping branches rerooted themselves in the ground to produce new
trees. The gnarled trunk, carefully shaded to give a sense of its
age, and its white blossoms are smack up against the viewer's eye;
seen through them are a warm rosy sky and a gray-green lawn. So
intrigued was van Gogh by this innovative composition that in 1887
he reinterpreted it on canvas.
</P>
<P>
   Summer, manifested in evening outings in pleasure boats, urban
festivals, more floral extravaganzas and the rainy season, is the
subject of another 30 prints. There is a wonderful rendition of
blossoming irises in a suburban garden in which Hiroshige uses the
same close-up perspective device as in the dragon plum print. It
includes, too, a scene considered the masterpiece of the entire
series, ``Sudden Shower Over Shin-Ohashi Bridge and Atake,'' in
which long, slanting lines of rain from heavy clouds descend on a
handful of figures crossing a wooden bridge. The lowering clouds,
the people assaulted by the torrent, and the fuzzy outlines of
mist-veiled trees on the shore convey an isolation and helplessness
in the face of impulsive, imperious Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Autumn brought excursions to scenic attractions, harvest
festivals, the harvest moon and leaf-looking, just as in today's
New England. Twenty-six of the prints are devoted to the season,
among them such striking examples as ``Moon-Viewing Point,'' a
tranquil rendering of a full moon, calm water and the room in a
brothel from which they are seen; ``Naito Shinjuku, Yotsuya,'' a
view of a rowdy highway town inflected by the giant hind quarters
of horses and their droppings; and ``Fireworks at Ryogoku,'' an
explosive burst that lights up the night sky over the Ryogoku
Bridge with its attendant pleasure boats.
</P>
<P>
   Winter, a time for snow-gazing and the spotting of cranes, is
celebrated in images like ``Minowa, Kanasugi, Mikawashima,'' a
distant view of three villages in an area where cranes were
protected. A huge, stylized bird swoops down from the sky toward a
more realistic one standing on the shore beneath.
</P>
<P>
   There are striking snow scenes like ``Kinryuzan Temple,
Asakusa,'' where, at the entrance to the city's oldest Buddhist
shrine, snow falls from a gray sky to sketch trees and temple
buildings, with the scene dominated by an outsize lantern in red
and black that swings from the top of the temple gate like a
celestial body.
</P>
<P>
   And there are witty, offbeat treatments like ``Asakusa Rice
Fields and Torinomachi Festival,'' whose skewed perspective reveals
a distant view of a temple celebration watched by a cat in a
brothel window right under the viewer's nose.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he produced ``100 Famous Views of Edo,'' the most
ambitious landscape series in the ukiyo-e genre, Hiroshige was long
famous for his success in the medium. Earlier, he had published
hits like ``36 Views of Mount Fuji'' (early 1830's) and ``53
Stations of the Tokaido'' (1833-34), a pictorial account of events
on the highway from Tokyo to Kyoto.
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in Edo, the son of a low-ranking member of the
elite samurai class who served the shogun as a fire-protection
official, Hiroshige began to study printmaking as a teen-ager after
the death of his father. He inherited his father's job but
nonetheless managed to work with a master printmaker for 17 years.
He learned to enrich the basic woodblock image with such techniques
as gradation, or bokashi, a process of carefully wiping color off
the block before printing, and creating texture by pressing fabric
into the paper.
</P>
<P>
   He came into his own after the death of his master in 1828, when
he turned to landscape. With wit, a flair for innovative
composition, sudden shifts in perspective and skilled coloring he
turned out arresting views with lyrical overtones, and became
immensely, even glibly, productive. Approaching old age, he shaved
his head and renounced the world to become a Buddhist priest, which
may have helped him focus his efforts. Whether or not the results
gratified the artist, they richly reward the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hiroshige: One Hundred Famous Views of Edo'' is at the
Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park,
(718) 638-5000, through April 23.

</P>
<P>
   Every few years, the rest of the United States suspends its
indifference toward South Carolina just long enough to deplore yet
another instance of that state's benightedness.
</P>
<P>
   If the state isn't barring women from the Citadel, it's letting
its sleazy gambling industry buy the governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   If it's not selling the governor's office, favorite son Lee
Atwater is Willie Horton-izing American politics.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina has not disappointed during the Republican
presidential primary. The campaign has illuminated the appalling
fundamentalist theology of Bob Jones University -- which still bars
interracial dating -- and South Carolina's endless controversy over
whether to remove the Confederate flag that still flies over the
state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina's location on the northern border of the Deep
South is one reason why the state astonishes outsiders. Compared to
North Carolina's aggressive cosmopolitanism, South Carolina's
Confederate flag, intense religiosity, and militarism may seem
puzzling.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they are typical of the region. Mississippi doesn't
have a Confederate flag controversy even though that banner is its
official state flag. South Carolina may consider itself ``the
buckle on the Bible Belt,'' but so do Deep South neighbors
Mississippi, Alabama, and Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   The history of South Carolina is mostly defined by its cussed
insistence that it doesn't really belong to the United States. More
than any other state, it has championed states' rights, a euphemism
for ``let us do whatever we damn well please.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Civil War, it was the only state with a black
majority, and its white leaders were the most vehement in the
Confederacy about preserving slavery. Sen. John C. Calhoun devised
the doctrine of ``nullification,'' whereby a state could reject
federal laws with which it disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina seceded first from the Union, fired on Fort
Sumter to begin the Civil War, and lost a larger percentage of
(white) men in the war than any state in the Confederacy. (Its
philosophy: Extremism in defense of slavno vice.)
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina remained proudly on the fringes after the war,
rejecting the United States as much as possible. During
Reconstruction, the Klan and other whites conducted a successful
insurgency against blacks and Union occupiers, the most vicious of
postwar struggles.
</P>
<P>
   After Reconstruction, South Carolina mercilessly disenfranchised
its black population. Strom Thurmond fomented the Dixiecrat
rebellion of 1948, running for president on a state's rights,
segregationist platform.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Thurmond became the first major Southern politician to
secede from the Democratic Party. Later he helped concoct Richard
Nixon's Southern strategy. More recently, South Carolina embraced
the religious right with a fervor unmatched elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina's exceptionalism, so shocking to Yankees, is a
source of honor to many natives. The state has clung proudly to the
idea of the ``Lost Cause.''
</P>
<P>
   As Walter Edgar recounts in ``South Carolina: A History,'' white
South Carolinians adopted the Lost Cause as a civic religion after
the Civil War. The state became a monument to glorious defeat, with
Charleston as the ``Holy City.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Heritage'' groups dedicated to memorializing the war thrive in
South Carolina. These are the folks who especially pushed to keep
women out of the Citadel and to keep the flag flying. They are
happy to let history pass them by.
</P>
<P>
   But the real lost cause in South Carolina is the Lost Cause
itself. Lost Cause South Carolina -- isolationist, racist,
atavistic -- is shrinking every day, replaced by homogenized,
moderate burbs.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina's economy, long an embarrassment, has become
tech-driven and booming. The textile mills that anchored the
state's economy have been slaughtered by foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
   But South Carolina did not retreat into the nativism and
isolationism you might expect (except for conservative textile
magnate Roger Milliken, who bankrolls anti-WTO groups). Instead,
the state's business leaders and politicians have made it the
nation's biggest magnet for foreign investment. Its technical
colleges and anti-union rules have drawn high-tech manufacturing
firms by the hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   Per capita, South Carolina has more people working for foreign
companies than any state but Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Demographically, too, it is becoming like the rest of the
nation. Immigrants used to be rare and unwelcome. Fifty years ago,
fewer than 10 percent of South Carolinians were born outside the
state. Today, more than a third of South Carolinians were not born
there. They are less religious, less Southern, and less socially
conservative than the natives.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks, who comprise 30 percent of the population, now play
leading roles in the economy and politics. South Carolina even
looks more like America. Sprawl has swallowed its small cities and
charming rural towns. The northeastern quadrant of the state feels
like a giant strip mall.
</P>
<P>
   These economic and demographic shifts have softened the state's
abrasive politics. South Carolina Republicans now rescue
establishment presidential candidates damaged by New Hampshire. Bob
Dole whacked Pat Buchanan here in 1996. Bush routed Buchanan in
1992 and Pat Robertson in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The press credits these victories to the wizardry of former Gov.
Carroll Campbell and Atwater, who supposedly herded the state's
sheeplike Republicans to vote for their favored candidate.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina Republicans, however, have boosted mainstream
candidates not because they are Campbell's or Atwater's sheep, but
because the state is much more mainstream than it seems. The
throwback ``heritage'' vote, though noisy, is a small minority of
the state, and even a small minority of Republicans. Christian
conservatives don't have a choke hold on the GOP either.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina is more Republican than the rest of the country,
but not in a nutty way. Its Republicans are pro-business
pragmatists. South Carolina escaped violence during the civil
rights movement because the state's white business leaders, after
resisting integration for as long as they could, realized they
wanted a placid business environment more than they wanted
segregation. The state chamber of commerce has led the campaign to
remove the Confederate flag.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Guth, who studies religion and politics at Furman
University, has noted that South Carolina's Christian conservatives
are less ideological than their cartoon image suggests. (Bob Jones
University President Bob Jones III, for example, is pushing to
remove the Confederate flag.)
</P>
<P>
   Today's South Carolina consistently elects pragmatists, not
ideologues. In 1998, Sen. Fritz Hollings, a highly secular
politician, beat Christian conservative challenger Bob Inglis.
Inglis relied on priggish, hard-right principles, while Hollings
made bald commercial appeals to pork-barreling and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond, once a firebrand on race, has held his Senate seat by
moderating his views and lavishing federal funds on the state. The
Citadel now enrolls women. Most South Carolinians frown on Bob
Jones' loopy dating rules. A huge majority of South Carolinians
want the Confederate flag removed. (It will almost certainly come
down by year's end, thanks to a compromise between white
Republicans and black Democrats.)
</P>
<P>
   In short, the state that behaved for a century as if it didn't
belong to the United States has become just like it. Which is why
South Carolina is exactly the right place to hold the Republican
primary that matters most.

CADILLAC HOPES TO LURE NEW, YOUNGER BUYERS WITH ITS REVAMPED
DEVILLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eager to lure more baby boomers into its showrooms, Cadillac has
redesigned its big luxury sedan, the Deville, for 2000, trimming it
down some and giving it a larger measure of performance.
</P>
<P>
   Translated, that means it's not the boat it used to be, but it's
still big. And unlike its rear-wheel-drive predecessors, the
all-new Deville, with front-wheel drive, actually can be fun to
drive. It doesn't feel as though you're maneuvering your living
room.
</P>
<P>
   Diehard Deville fans, who generally are people over age 60,
might complain about the loss of interior room, but I doubt it. The
Deville has plenty enough room to hold six adults comfortably.
Although it's about two inches shorter and two inches narrower than
its predecessor, the wheelbase is 1.5 inches longer. But there is
some loss of leg and shoulder room in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   Exterior styling has changed somewhat, but the car still has
that boxy look of the Deville, probably a concession to the 2
million Deville owners. Whether maintaining a large measure of the
previous generation's styling will bring new, younger buyers into
Cadillac showrooms remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac's biggest challenge, not just with the new Deville but
with its entire line, is to get import luxury-car buyers to take a
closer look. Cadillac wants to move beyond its loyal following
among retired blue-collar workers and gain some conquest sales
against the luxury cars that baby-boomer professionals find
appealing: the Mercedes-Benz, Lexus, BMW, Infinti and Acura brands.
</P>
<P>
   Many affluent boomers think of Cadillac as flashy cars that cost
a lot, but don't hold up or maintain their values well. I can tell
you that today's Caddies are much better than those of five, 10, 15
or 20 years ago. And resale values are stronger than they have been
in the past, too.
</P>
<P>
   So if you can live with the fact that it is a Cadillac and not a
Lexus, Mercedes or BMW, and you need a comfortable car with lots of
room, then the Deville might be worth a look.
</P>
<P>
   It handles surprisingly well. Part of that comes from the
chassis, which is shared with Cadillac's popular Seville sedan. The
Deville also shares the Northstar engine with the Seville. There is
ample power from this 4.6-liter, 275-horsepower V-8, but there
isn't much power to spare: the Deville weighs almost 4,000 pounds
(without passengers), almost as much as before. To move that much
weight around requires a strong engine.
</P>
<P>
   Elegance abounds in this car, beginning with the exterior paint.
Our test car, the DHS (Deville High Luxury Sedan, $44,700 plus $670
transportation), came with ``white diamond'' paint, a beautiful
creamy color that has a luxurious shine. It looks downright
expensive. The silly and ostentatious pseudo-luxury trim of
Cadillacs of the past has been mostly left off of the new Deville,
in keeping with the preferences of younger, more upscale buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The seats are comfortable, but not overly cushy, and the
interior is fairly well laid out. There were a few miscues inside,
_ something you wouldn't find on, say, a Lexus. For one, the memory
control for the power driver's seat was confusing to operate.
During most of my weeklong test drive, the car automatically raised
the front seat and pushed it closer to the dashboard when I got
out.
</P>
<P>
   That meant that when I tried to get back into the car, it was a
hard fit. I had to reach down and adjust the seat just before I got
in.
</P>
<P>
   High-technology abounds in the new Deville, another strategy
Cadillac is using to lure younger, savvy buyers. Leading the list
of high-tech gizmos is a night-vision system adapted from a system
used by U.S. troops in the Gulf War. The system uses an infrared
beam and camera, coupled with a heads-up display projected onto the
lower part of the driver-side windshield. The system lets the
driver see people or animals in the road 100 feet in front of the
headlights' reach.
</P>
<P>
   It works pretty well. Although our test vehicle didn't come with
this $2,000 option, I drove a Deville with the system late last
year. It was helpful in spotting people crossing the road. Buying a
Deville with night vision might be difficult, as the supplier has
only a limited quantity available for this model year.
</P>
<P>
   One high-tech feature that came on our test car was the Global
Positioning System navigation system ($1,995) built into the center
of the dashboard. The video display for this system has a colorful
moving map, and will lead drivers wherever they want to go.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, most of the radio/audio-system controls on our
test car were in the form of touch-spots on the navigation system's
video screen. That's ironic, because the screen has a
lawyer-inspired warning that you shouldn't attempt to work the
navigation system while driving the car. (You have to touch the ``I
agree'' spot on the screen just to make the navigation system
operate.) But you can't turn the radio on or off, or tune it, or
set the audio controls, without taking your eyes off the road and
concentrating on the video screen. Besides being a real nuisance,
it's also dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   What in the world were they thinking? It's unfortunate, because
this is otherwise a nice car. I would leave the navigation system
out if I were buying the Deville, just so I could get normal radio
controls.
</P>
<P>
   I loved the neutral shale leather interior, the
more-than-adequate cupholders, and the interior lighting of the
Deville. The trunk is huge _ nearly 20 cubic feet _ so you can cram
in lots of luggage, groceries or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Standard features on our test car included a
super-smooth-shifting four-speed automatic transmission,
rain-sensing windshield wipers (yep, another high-tech gadget),
power everything, 16-inch chrome wheels, front and side air bags
for the front seat, Bose AM/FM/cassette stereo (with optional $595
six-disc CD changer), ultrasonic rear-parking assist (which gives
audible warnings of anything in the car's way while it is backing
up), and lots more.
</P>
<P>
   Options ran the sticker of our test car up to $50,795, including
transportation, which puts the DHS at about the same price as a
Lexus LS 400, Mercedes-Benz E430 or BMW 540iA. Whether the Deville
can run with those big boys in the luxury-car ranks remains to be
seen, but there is no doubt that this is the best Deville ever.
You, the consumers, will ultimately decide whether it is good
enough to compete.
</P>
<P>
   There are two other versions of the new Deville. The base car,
called simply Deville, starts at $39,500. The sportier DTS _
Deville Touring Sedan _ comes with most of the equipment found on
the DHS, but has bucket seats up front, and therefore seats only
five. It lists for the same as the DHS, $44,700.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings are 17 miles per gallon in the city and
26 on the highway. The tank holds 20 gallons of fuel, and
apparently unleaded regular is just fine. Unlike most other
high-priced luxury sedans, the DHS had no sticker recommending the
use of premium fuel. That's a nice break, especially with gas
prices continuing to rise.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   At A Glance:
</P>
<P>
   2000 Cadillac Deville DHS sedan
</P>
<P>
   THE PACKAGE: Full-size, four-door, front-drive, V-8 powered
luxury sedan.
</P>
<P>
   HIGHLIGHTS: Completely redesigned for 2000, the new Deville
rides on the same chassis as the Seville, and is slightly smaller
than its predecessor. It has a whole list of standard or optional
high-tech gadgets, including a night vision system adapted from the
U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
   NEGATIVES: Touch-screen controls for the audio system, which
come with the optional GPS navigation system, are dangerous. They
require that the driver divert attention and vision from the road
to the computer screen in the lower middle of the dashboard to
operate the stereo.
</P>
<P>
   MAJOR COMPETITORS: Lincoln Town Car, Mercedes-Benz E-class, BMW
5-series, Lexus LS 400, Infiniti Q45.
</P>
<P>
   EPA FUEL ECONOMY: 17 miles per gallon city/26 highway.
</P>
<P>
   BASE PRICE: $44,700 plus $670 transportation.
</P>
<P>
   PRICE AS TESTED: $50,795, including transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE ROAD RATING: B-plus.

 FINDING THE TOOTH FAIRY ON eBAY  
(For release Sun., Feb. 20) 
(jt) 
 By JOYCE WADLER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here I am chatting with my mother long distance to Florida, no
big news, just catching up, when she hits me with it:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, want to hear a hot one? I sold my teeth on eBay. I got
$16.''
</P>
<P>
   My mother is 72 and _ how can a daughter put this nicely? _ she
has always been a little wacko. She swiped trees from state
preserves when I was a kid, saying her tax dollars had paid for
them anyway. She lines up with the college kids during spring break
in Daytona Beach to get a free sample of anything. There isn't too
much she can do to surprise me or, more to the point, embarrass me,
but this one just knocks me out.
</P>
<P>
   I sit there in my living room on a Sunday night, stunned,
stupefied. I say, ``You did  &UR; what &LR; ?'' as if I am in a sitcom. Then
we get into the why. ``Why did you sell your teeth on eBay, Ma?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know all that work I was having on my teeth?'' Ma says.
``The dentist took out this bridge, and there was some gold, and he
said, `You know, you could probably get a few bucks for these.' So
I put them on eBay and sold them.'' Laughing now. ``What do you
think? I think it's a riot.''
</P>
<P>
   You know when I said there was nothing more my mother could do
to embarrass me? I may not be so evolved as I think, for I feel
it's very important to say right away about selling her teeth, that
my mother doesn't need the money. This is a woman who bought IBM at
$11 in a slump in 1993 and who has begun, as they say in Florida,
to divest.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it is about the money. My mother once sold
real estate and antiques. Now she sells antique postcards. It's the
art of the deal with her, but as luck would have it, she's not
dealing Manhattan real estate. She's dealing a four-tooth bridge
that she no longer needs. But the game is the same. I can see that
the minute the dentist, joking with Ma as he put in some new
crowns, told her she might get a few bucks for her old teeth, that
was it, those teeth were going to be in play.
</P>
<P>
   And my mother is not one of those sweet old widows who don't
know their way around computers. My mother is wired. She's got a
Web site for her postcard business, she's got a scanner and she was
sending me musical birthday cards when I didn't have the software
to open them or the hardware to hear them.
</P>
<P>
   Her boyfriend, George, who lives with her, is studying computer
repair, and the screened porch is littered with so many computer
carcasses that it looks like a Booth cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   I'm clear now on why my mother sold her teeth on eBay. What I
don't understand is who would buy them. A metal dealer? A jeweler?
Or creepier, a ``Silence of the Lambs'' type collector of body
parts?
</P>
<P>
   I am also feeling upset by the idea of my mother's teeth out
there in cyberspace: the words that have passed over those teeth,
the intimate familial discussions. Although as I think about it,
they may not even be Ma's home-grown. My mother said she sold a
bridge. But why would artificial teeth have gold fillings?
</P>
<P>
   Off to eBay I go and type in the word ``teeth.'' More than 400
matches come up: ``tiger teeth,'' ``bear teeth.'' The search is too
broad.
</P>
<P>
   I refine my search to ``gold teeth.'' Victory! There is a photo
of a human tooth, almost entirely gold, and the bidding is at $36.
This is not Ma's tooth.
</P>
<P>
   I call Ma back, partly because I want the satisfaction of
telling her she sold too low, partly to find out where her ad,
which she said would still be displayed, is hiding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, of course it's not under `teeth,''' Ma says. ``What sort
of a person would list anything under `teeth'? It's under
`collectibles, metals.' I'll give you the number if you can't find
it.''
</P>
<P>
   I type the number, 224788832, and sure enough, there's my
mother's ad: ``Here are 4 adult teeth as best as I can describe
them. They are capped with gold. I wonder if this is a first for
eBay? It sure is for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The high bidder _ the only bidder _ is somebody called Luxor.
</P>
<P>
   It's an interesting tag, Luxor. It makes me think of Egypt,
archaeology, gold treasures. I could call Luxor, whom I perceive,
for some reason, as male. My mother has his address, it would be
easy enough to get his phone number, but I put it off. I want to
wait for the check to clear, and although I interview people for a
living, I am not sure what I would say. Finally, after a few weeks,
I get up my nerve and send Luxor an e-mail message, which seems the
correct way to proceed: ``My name is Joyce Wadler, I'm a reporter
at The New York Times, and if my last name sounds familiar, it's
because you obtained, at auction, four of my mother's teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   And of course, a question or two about why.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the reply comes back from a Laurence Lindberg:
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I do have a certain interest in the macabre, I can
usually restrain my enthusiasm for old dental work,'' it reads in
part. ``I bought your mother's teeth strictly for the possible gold
content, taking a small risk in doing so due to the inept
description.'' A bit insensitive, I think.
</P>
<P>
   And, ``Why are your mother's teeth for sale, anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   Luxor, as I still think of him, is, frankly, shaping up to me as
a little grumpy, perhaps because Ma's teeth have not yet arrived,
and when I call him up the next day, he still seems a little
crabby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, I'm Joyce, the person whose mother sold her teeth on
eBay,'' I begin, feeling awkward, because there is no way to
discuss your mother's selling her teeth and seem suave, and before
I'm finished, Luxor interrupts.
</P>
<P>
   ``She shouldn't have,'' he says sternly. ``It wasn't a good way.
They weren't tested or weighed. The only way anyone would buy them
would be if they could get them cheap. If she had taken them
someplace, she would have gotten a better price. At $16, the teeth
probably have somewhere between $35 and $60 worth of gold in them,
which is a handsome profit.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've done this before,'' I say.
</P>
<P>
   Luxor, who lives in Richmond, warms up and gives me the story of
his life: he's 45, married with children, runs an antique clothing
store called Luxor and studied anthropology at Virginia
Commonwealth University. In the late '70s, Luxor got involved in
scrap metal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silver and gold prices were quite high,'' Luxor says. ``Gold
eventually got up as high as $850 an ounce _ now it's $310. Silver
prices got up as high as $60 an ounce _ now it's $5. The Hunt
brothers were trying to corner the silver market, and that made a
bump in the gold. I'd been going around to the antique clothing
stores, buying gold and silver things that were actually priced at
less than their weight that I would sell as scrap. There's a lot of
gold and silver stuff that's not marked. For instance, there was a
particular kind of pin produced in Colombia, an orchid, always in
18-karat gold, that weighed about 20 grams. At that time, that
would be $400.''
</P>
<P>
   Luxor, anyway, does not make a business of buying gold teeth. A
half dozen or so come his way every year in the antique clothing
business, often in jewelry boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A jewelry box is a reasonable place to put something of value
you don't have immediate use for,'' Luxor says. ``There's often a
stray crown. It does accumulate, and once a year or so, I bundle it
up and take it to a refinery. Usually, when I take in a lot,
jewlery and teeth, it's about six ounces of various grades that
usually yields about three ounces of pure gold, which is about
$1,500.''
</P>
<P>
   A fake tooth, a crown, might contain gold?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes,'' Luxor says. ``It's not corrosive. It can be in the
mouth forever. It's very durable. A crown might look like
porcelain, but inside it, it would be gold.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Luxor does not usually buy metals on line, because it's
difficult to know what he's buying. In a shop, he explains, ``you
can capitalize on other people's ignorance, you can handle objects,
taste them, smell them, you can tell what they are.'' ( &UR; Taste &LR; 
them! Oh, no! A strange man tasting my mother's teeth!) But he has
had good luck in the metals category of eBay. He bought (for $42) a
lot of Georgian sterling silver spoons (value, $350) from a fellow
who thought they were plate. Cruising through metals again, Luxor
found Ma's teeth, the first teeth he has ever bought on line. Yes,
he will remove the gold himself. When the teeth arrive he will take
them outside and smash them with a hammer on the sidewalk, so he
doesn't get porcelain fragments all over the shop.
</P>
<P>
   I'm starting to feel as if I know Luxor. He's not unlike my
mother when it comes to the joy of the deal, so I share.
</P>
<P>
   It makes me melancholy to think of my mother's teeth being
smashed on the sidewalk, I tell Luxor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you like, you may think of me doing it delicately at the
jewelry bench,'' Luxor says.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that testing thing,'' I say elliptically. How will Luxor
be testing my mother's teeth?
</P>
<P>
   ``With a kit.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a relief.
</P>
<P>
   I have toyed with the notion of buying back Ma's teeth, and
Luxor is willing. But I decide against it on philosophical grounds:
ultimately are we all not gold nuggets or discard to be smashed on
the metaphorical sidewalk? And what would I do with four old teeth?
I step aside to let the mighty river of e-commerce flow on
unobstructed, and a few days later I receive an e-mail dispatch,
jubilant in tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi _ Your mom's teeth came today, and I'm afraid that she
didn't do as well as she could have. The gold in the teeth weighed
7.5 grams, which is about 5 pennyweights. It is about 20 K or 83
percent pure. This works out to 1/5th of an ounce of pure gold,
which at $283 per ounce is $56.87. A scrap buyer would have paid
about 70 percent of that or $39.81. Of course, to do that, she
would have had to separate out the gold and take it to someone who
would buy it, both of which she might have found distasteful. As it
was, she got to sell them through a medium that she was comfortable
with and didn't have to deal directly with anyone sleazy enough to
buy old teeth. Perhaps it was worth the $23 difference.''

</P>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID GREENBERG &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Can we declare a moratorium on historical analogies? Every four
years, reporters predictably liken presidential candidates present
to candidates past.
</P>
<P>
   It's a silly game that springs from an essentially
instrumentalist view of history -- a view of history that treats
the past not as a foreign country but as a wax museum of figures to
trot out in the service of present-day arguments. Analogy-makers
study history not to complicate our understanding of today's world
but to simplify it. Besides, the analogies are usually thinner than
rice paper.
</P>
<P>
   The favorite comparison of this campaign seems to be John McCain
as the second coming of Theodore Roosevelt -- a parallel pushed by,
among others, Rich Lowry of the National Review, Jonathan Chait of
the New Republic, David Brooks of the Weekly Standard, and John
McCain himself. Like so many before, it's a flimsy one.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, both McCain and TR were hotheads who had uneasy
relationships with their party's political power brokers. Yes, both
men railed about reining in big business during periods that unduly
celebrated capitalists. Both traded on their military records to
call for a renewal of national purpose.
</P>
<P>
   But that's as far as the analogy goes. And even that summary
masks more than it reveals.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, consider the war hero business. Besides their
shared militaristic bravado, McCain and TR have little in common
here.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt romanticized battle. ``This country needs a war,'' he
wrote in 1895, arguing that without one Americans would grow
``flabby'' and ``timid.'' When his and others' agitation finally
brought about the Spanish-American War in 1898, TR left his post as
assistant secretary of the Navy to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Although Roosevelt showed bravery as a ``Rough Rider,'' the war
lasted just a few months, allowing TR to return to New York in time
to be elected governor in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   TR's limited military experience didn't stop him from exploiting
his war-hero image -- or from advocating imperial expansion for the
United States. An unapologetic believer in the superiority of the
``Anglo-Saxon race,'' he cheered the subjugation of the American
West and its native inhabitants, and sought new lands for America
to conquer.
</P>
<P>
   As president (1901-09), he proclaimed the ``Roosevelt
Corollary'' to the Monroe Doctrine, justifying much adventurism in
Latin America, and in 1907 he sent the American fleet on a global
tour, strutting the nation's naval force to stoke his own pride.
</P>
<P>
   Where TR jauntily volunteered in a cakewalk of a war that opened
the door for American imperialism, John McCain enlisted in a
stalemate that ended the support for the United States' foreign
interventions.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Vietnam War veterans, McCain returned from his five
years as a POW chastened by the horrors of battle and wary of
committing troops overseas. As a senator, he has often opposed
military missions, and he now cautions that the United States
shouldn't be ``dragooned by other countries or international
organizations into risking American lives in quarrels that are
entirely someone else's affair.''
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt's cheap heroism confirmed all his macho instincts.
McCain's ordeal disabused him of his.
</P>
<P>
   On domestic reform, the TR-McCain analogy collapses. At the
heart of Roosevelt's Progressivism was a belief that only the
government, particularly the president, had the means to fight the
corporate magnates who had accrued unprecedented wealth and power
in the industrial economy -- ``the malefactors of great wealth,''
as TR called them.
</P>
<P>
   The Rooseveltian ``nationalism'' that so many of today's
conservatives revere rested squarely on TR's declaration that the
era of small government was over.
</P>
<P>
   Born to wealth, Roosevelt was ambivalent about his privileged
background. Though he disdained ``the mob'' and radicals, he had
equally harsh words for his social peers, their pursuit of personal
profit, and their indifference toward the common good.
</P>
<P>
   Though less a ``trust buster'' (as some have remembered him)
than a regulator, Roosevelt secured meaningful legislation to
safeguard public welfare. His administration passed laws to check
the power of the railroads, to provide for safe food and drugs, and
to conserve American forests.
</P>
<P>
   A proponent of a strong executive branch, Roosevelt expanded the
administrative power of the presidency as never before. He also
made use of the ``bully pulpit'' (a term he coined), exhorting
Americans, rich and poor, to put aside their materialism in the
interest of collective betterment.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that activist record to McCain's. For all his ballyhooed
appeal to independents, McCain remains a conventional conservative
on domestic issues. Only on campaign finance and tobacco regulation
has he broken markedly with Republican Party orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   On TR's issues -- the environment, regulation of business, and
the desirability of a vigorous federal government -- McCain could
not be less progressive. A darling of business groups, he calls for
repealing workplace-safety regulations, scaling back environmental
protections, and skewing the tax code to favor business even more
than it already does.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, one way in which McCain genuinely resembles
TR. McCain made himself competitive in the Republican race by
assiduously cultivating the press. Possessed, by all accounts, of
an attractive personality, he has curried favor with reporters by
granting them boundless face time and providing good copy with his
straight talk.
</P>
<P>
   Guess who did that first? Roosevelt, an outsized personality if
there ever was one, learned to ply the press in his 20s, when he
was a New York assemblyman. As his celebrity grew, his penchant for
speaking his mind -- some thought it arrogance -- made for
delicious stories.
</P>
<P>
   As president, he installed the first press room in the White
House and held the first informal presidential press conferences,
usually while getting his afternoon shave. He played favorites,
leaked selectively, and rewarded loyal reporters with good stories.
Journalists loved him.
</P>
<P>
   As I finished this column, the press was showing signs of
boredom with the McCain-Roosevelt comparison. The New York Times'
Howell Raines and the Wall Street Journal's Holman W. Jenkins Jr.
have recently written about the parallels between McCain and
another Republican president, Dwight D. Eisenhower. There's the
military heroism, the father-figure aura, the appeal that
transcends issues, the promise to clean up Washington, the
outsiderness.
</P>
<P>
   Here we go again.

<P>
   Born to wealth, Roosevelt was ambivalent about his privileged
background. Though he disdained ``the mob'' and radicals, he had
equally harsh words for his social peers, their pursuit of personal
profit, and their indifference toward the common good.
</P>
<P>
   Though less a ``trust buster'' (as some have remembered him)
than a regulator, Roosevelt secured meaningful legislation to
safeguard public welfare. His administration passed laws to check
the power of the railroads, to provide for safe food and drugs, and
to conserve American forests.
</P>
<P>
   A proponent of a strong executive branch, Roosevelt expanded the
administrative power of the presidency as never before. He also
made use of the ``bully pulpit'' (a term he coined), exhorting
Americans, rich and poor, to put aside their materialism in the
interest of collective betterment.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that activist record to McCain's. For all his ballyhooed
appeal to independents, McCain remains a conventional conservative
on domestic issues. Only on campaign finance and tobacco regulation
has he broken markedly with Republican Party orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   On TR's issues -- the environment, regulation of business, and
the desirability of a vigorous federal government -- McCain could
not be less progressive. A darling of business groups, he calls for
repealing workplace-safety regulations, scaling back environmental
protections, and skewing the tax code to favor business even more
than it already does.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, one way in which McCain genuinely resembles
TR. McCain made himself competitive in the Republican race by
assiduously cultivating the press. Possessed, by all accounts, of
an attractive personality, he has curried favor with reporters by
granting them boundless face time and providing good copy with his
straight talk.
</P>
<P>
   Guess who did that first? Roosevelt, an outsized personality if
there ever was one, learned to ply the press in his 20s, when he
was a New York assemblyman. As his celebrity grew, his penchant for
speaking his mind -- some thought it arrogance -- made for
delicious stories.
</P>
<P>
   As president, he installed the first press room in the White
House and held the first informal presidential press conferences,
usually while getting his afternoon shave. He played favorites,
leaked selectively, and rewarded loyal reporters with good stories.
Journalists loved him.
</P>
<P>
   As I finished this column, the press was showing signs of
boredom with the McCain-Roosevelt comparison. The New York Times'
Howell Raines and the Wall Street Journal's Holman W. Jenkins Jr.
have recently written about the parallels between McCain and
another Republican president, Dwight D. Eisenhower. There's the
military heroism, the father-figure aura, the appeal that
transcends issues, the promise to clean up Washington, the
outsiderness.
</P>
<P>
   Here we go again.

   IRAN-ELECT (Tehran, Iran) _ Clutching palm cards from their
favorite political parties and crumpled hand-drawn lists of
candidates, Iranians streamed to the polls Friday in numbers large
enough to force officials to extend the voting time by two hours.
People were still waiting in line to vote outside of mosques and
schools in Tehran at 9 p.m., when the voting for the Parliament
officially ended. The apparently big turnout heartened the
reformers who hoped to ride into power on a wave of popular
discontent with the conservative clergymen who have dominated the
country for 21 years. By Susan Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-OIL (Veracruz, Mexico) _ For two years, Mexico has worked
with other oil rich nations to pump up petroleum prices. But now
that those efforts have borne fruit, senior officials in recent
days have done an about face and are trying to talk the world price
back down because of Mexico's dependence on the United States'
economy. This performance has put President Ernesto Zedillo's
government in a ticklish predicament. Leaders of the industrialized
world are glaring at Mexico, complaining that petroleum prices are
fueling inflation. And the Mexican left is accusing the government
of giving up an oil bonanza by capitulating to the imperialists. By
Sam Dillon.

   CUBAN-SPY (Miami) _ A high-ranking U.S. immigration official was
charged with spying for the Cuban government on Friday, having been
caught in what federal officials described as an elaborate sting
operation as he was telling a Cuban intelligence agent about a
Cuban citizens' plan to defect to the United States. In a case with
no known precedent in the long and hostile relationship of the
United States and the 41-year-old Castro government, Mariano Faget,
54, who was born in Havana, was arrested by the FBI late Thursday
and charged with violations of the Espionage Act and of lying to
federal agents. By Peter T. Kilborn.

   ILL-GOVERNOR (Springfield, Ill.) _ Sitting in a chair facing a
bronze statue of Abraham Lincoln in the Illinois capitol, Gov.
George Ryan shuddered as he recalled ``the most anguishing period
of my life.'' Ryan had been deciding whether to grant a stay of
execution last year for a man convicted of a brutal slaying and
mutilation. In the end, Ryan, a supporter of the death penalty,
denied the stay, and hoped he would never be faced with such a
decision again. But a little over a month ago, the state attorney
general, Jim Ryan, called the governor to tell him that another
execution would soon be scheduled in Illinois, a state that has
seen 13 men wrongfully convicted and sent to death row. ``I can't
do it,'' the governor told him. ``I'm going to put a stop to this.
The system is broken. It's time we take a look and see what's
wrong.'' A few days later, Gov. Ryan declared a halt to executions
in Illinois, the first to impose such a moratorium. A profile by
Dirk Johnson.

   REPUBS-SC (Columbia, S.C.) _ Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John
McCain stopped courting supporters Friday and instead turned their
full attention to rousing them to the polls here in the final hours
of a race that both sides said appears so competitive that every
last effort to get out the vote could make a difference. The
contest here has stirred such intense interest that strategists on
both sides predicted that turnout would far exceed the 277,000 who
voted in the South Carolina primary four years ago. The looming _

   BUSH-ASSESS (Dateline to kum, S.C.) _ When he first began

savior of the GOP. He was young, different and brought with him a
message of unity not division, all qualities that the party
desperately needed to regain the White House. But in the 17 days
since he lost the New Hampshire primary, Bush has become a
Republican of the old generation, appealing to the right and
resorting to the same sort of harshly negative campaign tactics
that his father used when his back was against the wall. A news

&HT;     STUDY SAYS MANY HISPANICS LACK HEALTH INSURANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By NICOLE FOY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Nearly two in five Hispanics lack health
insurance, and the number of uninsured Hispanics has more than
doubled to 11.2 million between 1987 and 1998, according to a study
released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The causes behind the alarming trend are complex, but a key
reason many Hispanics go without health coverage is because they
are concentrated in low-wage jobs at small businesses that are
unlikely to offer employer-sponsored insurance, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   Funded by The Commonwealth Fund, a New York-based research
group, the study shows Hispanics are twice as likely to be
uninsured as is the general population. Hispanics also account for
one-quarter of the nation's 44 million uninsured, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   That represents a major challenge to states and communities with
booming Hispanic populations, said Kevin Moriarty, chief executive
officer of Methodist Healthcare Ministries. The ministry is a San
Antonio-based humanitarian organization that funds many health-care
initiatives for low-income residents in South Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to get people to jobs that pay for insurance is
through education to push them into higher-wage positions,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   By 2025, the Hispanic population of the United States is
expected to nearly double, rising to 59 million from 31 million.
</P>
<P>
   Texas ranks with Arizona as the states with highest overall rate
of uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Many Hispanics, like all uninsured people, are locked in a
struggle to provide the basic necessities for their families, such
as food and rent, said Anne Dunkelberg of the Center for Public
Policy Priorities, a nonprofit research group in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   If health insurance is not available through an employer, buying
insurance is usually too expensive, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, you're one of the lucky ones if your work finances
insurance coverage or subsidizes the cost of adding a spouse or a
child on the policy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the high rates of uninsured, Hispanics without health
coverage belong to families in which at least one person works, the
Commonwealth study found. More than half live in families in which
at least one person works full time, compared to a rate of 55
percent among non-Hispanic whites.
</P>
<P>
   But Moriarty stressed that, in many cases, those positions pay
such low wages that Hispanics are forced to ``work like crazy to
take care of their families'' by taking on more than one job.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Davis, president of the Commonwealth Fund, said the health
of Hispanic working families in the United States is suffering
because of the lack of insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the past year, almost half of uninsured Hispanics had
not seen a doctor, filled a prescription or received recommended
medical tests or treatment because of cost,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to another national study released this month,
conducted by the Urban Institute, the number of uninsured adult
American Indians closely follows the number of adult Hispanics
without health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   While Hispanics lead all racial and ethnic groups with 37
percent of adults uninsured, about 36 percent of adult American
Indians are in the same situation.
</P>
<P>
   About 22 percent of black adults are uninsured, while only 13
percent of white adults go without coverage, the Urban Institute
found.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, many Hispanic children are without health coverage,
although the new Children's Health Insurance Program, a push to
insure children, will begin in the state this spring, Dunkelberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dunkelberg cited figures from a national consumer group,
Families USA, showing that 56 percent of uninsured children in
Texas are Hispanic. Black children make up 14 percent of the
uninsured children and 28 percent of the uninsured children in
Texas are non-Hispanic whites.

PARADE OF DOGS THAT HAVE BEEN TRANSFORMED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Julie Brown stands in the crush and chaos of the
benching area at Madison Square Garden, where the dogs are encamped
during this week's prestigious Westminster Kennel Club dog show.
Nearby, in a crate, is her gorgeous white-and-brown Brittany, dual
champion Classic's Can Do Andrew. Like all the other Brittanys
competing in the show, he has just a short, fur-covered rod of a
tail. If his tail were longer, he wouldn't be here at all. And
Brown says she is determined to see things stay this way.
</P>
<P>
   Brittanys are among the 49 American Kennel Club breeds that
routinely have surgery to alter their tails or ears. All around
this show, which is considered the Super Bowl of canine
conformation, you will see these transformed dogs: Great Danes,
Doberman pinschers, schnauzers, Bouvier des Flandres with stand-up
``prick'' ears; terriers, spaniels, and old English sheep dogs with
short tails or nearly none at all. The look is so familiar to us
that we may even think these particular dogs are born this way.
</P>
<P>
   In England and many other countries, however, the surgeries are
banned as cruel and unnecessary. According to Nancy Peterson of the
Humane Society of the United States, Great Britain did away with
ear cropping back in the 1890s and has prohibited tail docking
since 1993. Further, she reports that the list of countries
following England's lead in these matters is extensive, and
includes Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Italy,
Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, we appear to be 100 years behind the
times. What all these countries have identified as a fashion
statement, some here call a medical necessity. Cropping and docking
is still a matter of great debate.
</P>
<P>
   Animal welfare organizations in the United States agree with
England: Ear cropping and tail docking (amputating some or most of
the tail) are useless procedures. Once done in pursuit of athletic
function, today they are performed, it is charged, purely for
cosmetic or aesthetic reasons.
</P>
<P>
   But individual breed clubs that support the procedures say it is
a medical issue. Ear cropping, they claim, reduces the incidence of
ear infections. Tail docking, they assert,is a safety precaution
for dogs who might injure a long tail in herding or hunting _ or in
exuberant wagging.
</P>
<P>
   Yet poodles and basset hounds have long ears that can get
infected, and we do not crop them. Great Danes and Irish wolfhounds
have long, strong tails that can be injured, and we do not dock
them.
</P>
<P>
   Many would like to see the procedures end in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation has been introduced in Ohio and Georgia to ban
cropping and docking. And just last month, a lawyer in New York,
Jon H. Hammer, brought suit against the American Kennel Club to
change the rules governing its dog shows.
</P>
<P>
   What does the powerful AKC have to say about all this? The
organization did not return phone calls to The Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many in the dog world, such as Old English
sheepdog owner Amy Howard, who will speak out. Her dog, Champion
Seathweite's Ecole Taj, was one of 20 entered in the breed at
Westminster. As several Old English breeders and owners stood in
the benching area defending tail docking and saying it is neither
painful nor unnecessary, Howard said, ``I hope I'm not in the
business when they stop docking them.''
</P>
<P>
   That day will come, though it may not be soon.
</P>
<P>
   This past July, the American Veterinary Medical Association
passed its first official policy statement against the operations,
but, though groundbreaking, it was mild. It stated that the
procedures are, in fact, ``for cosmetic reasons'' and do not
benefit animals medically. They cause pain and do put animals at
risk, the policy says, yet it only encourages vets to ``counsel dog
owners about these matters before agreeing to perform these
surgeries.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Gus Thornton, the president of the Massachusetts
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and a veterinarian
himself, this is a topic that has come a long way and has a long
way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been an issue that comes on the plate of the AVMA
almost every session,'' Thornton says. Other, stronger policy
statements have failed, so MSPCA backed the current resolution as a
realistic proposal that had a chance of passing. ``As far as I'm
concerned, this is a major first step,'' Thornton says.
</P>
<P>
   Amy D. Shojai, author of ``The Purina Encyclopedia of Dog
Care,'' says aside from rare cases of frostbite or fracture or a
few medical problems with the ears, cropping and docking are mostly
done ``for purely cosmetic reasons.'' She has worked in a
veterinarian's office where the procedures were performed. ``I've
held those puppies,'' she says, ``and I know they were in pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammer, the lawyer from New York, says he was unaware how
volatile the issue is until he filed suit. Since then he has been
inundated with calls and letters.
</P>
<P>
   For him, the whole thing is a simple matter of kindness and
logic. ``I'm a lawyer,'' Hammer says, ``so when I think something
is wrong, I litigate.''
</P>
<P>
   His 8-month-old Brittany, Spooner, has an uncut 10-inch tail,
and that does not fit the AKC standard for the breed, which reads
in part: ``Any tail substantially more than four inches shall be
severely penalized.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammer says the Brittany, an agile sporting dog, was bred to do
the same work as his English setter, a dog who has a lovely, long,
feathered tail. Hammer does not think docking in the Brittany is
about function.
</P>
<P>
   So he has filed suit in Manhattan's State Supreme Court,
claiming that tail docking violates the state's anti-cruelty laws.
He names both the AKC and the American Brittany Club Inc. as
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The AKC may say that it doesn't make the rules, the individual
breed clubs do, but Hammer disagrees. He says the registry reviews
the rules and can object to them. Further, he says, the AKC
promotes itself as a powerful purebreed organization. Indeed, its
Web site carries the statement: ``As the kennel club approaches the
year 2000, it has positioned itself at the forefront of anything
and everything involving purebred dogs _ their owners, breeders and
supporters _ companion and competitive, alike.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, to Hammer, there is one overriding principle in his
favor. ``To me,'' he says, ``a dog should have a tail.''

&HT;     MEAT BYPRODUCT LINKED TO STROKES, HEART ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While cholesterol and heart disease are linked in
the minds of many as closely as smoking and lung cancer, another
substance circulating in the blood may actually be a better
predictor of heart attacks, strokes and even seemingly unrelated
conditions like high-risk pregnancies and Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Homocysteine, a byproduct of meat metabolism, has become a
popular focus of study in recent years because of its close
association with cardiovascular disease. And the good news is that
something as simple as increasing the consumption of vitamin B and
folic acid lowers homocysteine levels and could help prevent
ailments associated with it.
</P>
<P>
   Now that tests have become relatively cheap ($50 to $150),
widely available and reliable, the impetus to begin testing at
least those in high-risk groups is growing, according to scientists
speaking here Thursday at the American Association for the
Advancement of Science meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who is at risk for cardiovascular disease, who has
present atherosclerosis or a family history of atherosclerosis _
those are candidates for homocysteine testing,'' said Donald
Jacobsen, a researcher at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The precise way homocysteine may be related to disease is not
yet understood. Some believe it generates oxygen-free radicals that
damage the endothelial cells that line blood vessels, leading to
clots and clogs. Another theory suggests it interferes with
molecules in the blood like nitric oxide that are involved in
relaxing blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is clear, though: Study after study has shown a strong
correlation between people who have high homocysteine levels in
their blood and heart disease. And among a large group of nurses,
researchers found that those who took multivitamin pills reduced
the chance of having a heart attack by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With the introduction of homocysteine tests in the late 1980s,
research in this area has skyrocketed. Scientists now are
publishing an average of one paper a day on it, according to M.
Rene Malinow, professor of medicine at Oregon Health Sciences
University.
</P>
<P>
   Several clinical trials are under way in the United States,
Europe, South Africa and Australia to test whether vitamin B and
folic acid supplements and their associated lowering of
homocysteine leads to less cardiovascular disease. The first
results are expected in about three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My tentative prediction is that universal homocysteine testing
and treatment ... may be incorporated into medical practice and
public health if any of the clinical trials demonstrate that B
vitamins have a beneficial affect on atherosclerosis disease,''
Malinow said.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two years, enriched flour sold in the United States
contains extra doses of folic acid, which is known to prevent spina
bifida and related birth defects. Such defects, too, may be related
to high homocysteine levels in pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksandar Rajkovic of the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston
has been studying the relationship of homocysteine to problems
during pregnancy, including preeclampsia, a dangerous elevation of
blood pressure. He said associations have also been made with
miscarriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten to 30 percent of patients who have reproductive problems
have elevated homocysteine,'' Rajkovic said.
</P>
<P>
   However, research in this area is much less comprehensive than
that involving heart disease. More recently, studies have been
published linking high homocysteine to Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   It is known than homocysteine levels rise over a person's
lifetime. A 3-year-old whose level is 5 micromols per liter (a
measurement based on molecular weight) would probably reach 25 by
the time he or she was 100, Jacobsen said. Women tend to have lower
rates than men, but that discrepancy begins to disappear after
menopause.

   SC-GOP _ Launching a final effort to propel conservatives to the

supporters who have raised doubts about his campaign. Rival John
McCain called his backers ``a few brave people'' thwarting the
Republican Party establishment. (Sherman, Atlanta

<P>
   SC-PRIMARY _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush faced the independent
voter challenge in New Hampshire and lost. They went for McCain. In
South Carolina, he faces an arguably greater challenge since the
primary is completely open, meaning Democrats can cross over to
vote in the Republican race and Democrats have no primary of their
own today. What will these voters do? And what are South Carolina
voters saying on the day they're set to cast their ballots? Has the
negative campaigning taken its toll? An advancer on Saturday's

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A band of generally light to moderate snow will affect parts of
northern and central New England Saturday as an upper-air
disturbance trails a surface low pressure moving off the New
England Coast. Heavier snows may fall in the mountains, where the
sloping terrain provides additional lift. Snow will taper and end
from southwest to northeast over the region later Saturday
afternoon and evening.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered showers and perhaps isolated thunderstorms will
develop Saturday afternoon along parts of the Middle Atlantic and
Southeast Seaboards as a cold front extending southwestward from
the low off the New England Coast clashes with very warm air
building from southeast Virginia to eastern Georgia, where
temperatures will soar into the 70s during the day. Temperatures
will recede 10 to 15 degrees Sunday across the area in the wake of
the front.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, unseasonably warm weather will embrace Florida
Saturday, with scattered cumulus clouds developing over the
Sunshine State. Very isolated showers could develop at the height
of the warmth in the afternoon, primarily over the southern half of
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Moist air associated with a low-pressure system off the southern
California Coast will stream inland, fueling a few showers, mainly
over some of the higher mountains. Farther north, seasonably mild
weather will persist in western Washington and western Oregon under
the auspices of a high-pressure system parked several thousand feet
aloft over the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Dead Clouds
</P>
<P>
   A large area of clouds but little precipitation hung over much
of the central and northern Plains early on Friday. Residual
moisture in the lower atmosphere in the wake of a storm system over
the Northeast promoted these ``dead clouds.'' Clouds become active
in the presence of currents of rising air associated with the
converging winds near areas of low pressure. After lows depart,
dead clouds sometimes persist when low-level winds are light. Light
winds limit the mixing of drier air aloft with the moist air that
remains in a shallow layer near the surface of the earth.

THAT STUBBORN SALT SHAKER TOP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, February 20, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  I have a sterling salt shaker that just won't open, won't
unscrew. Is there any secret way that I don't know about?
</P>
<P>
   J.H., Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. &LR;  No secrets that have not been around for 2,000 years. If it
is real sterling or even silverplate, and is of sentimental value,
it is worth working on. First, soak it in water overnight; if the
holes are not clogged, let the water go inside, too, to dissolve
the salt. In the morning, turn the cap, using one of those grab
pads of thin rubber. If doesn't work, aim a hair dryer on the cap;
the heat will cause the metal to expand, perhaps enough that it can
be twisted off. Or, hold the top in very hot water, which may do
the same thing. Don't do the water treatment if the bottom is
glass; you coud risk the breaking the glass. If it is all silver,
you must be careful not to distort both top and bottom by applying
too much pressure.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  I plan to have my stucco house painted next spring. The
stucco has been patched; otherwise it's in good shape. A man said
he would power wash. Would that hurt it?
</P>
<P>
   MARY MAHER, Watertown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. &LR;  Stucco should stand up to power washing, and if the power
can be adjusted, it can be moderated for stucco. In fact, you may
find that washing will be enough; there may be no need to paint. If
you do paint, you can use a cement-based paint, one that is
designed specifically for concrete and other masonry. Or, apply two
coats of a latex solid stain. You can get the latter in colors, and
no primer is needed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; About that slate . . .
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When T.K. asked if a new slate roof for his old house should
cost $70,000 (one of the bids the homeowner received), the handyman
said that was exorbitant, and suggested several alternatives,
including putting up asphalt shingles in place of the slate
(heresy, in some circles).
</P>
<P>
   Hold on, wrote Malcolm Hathaway of Maynard, Mass.: ``The reader
did not say how big his house is, but unless it is quite huge _
more than 30 square of roof (3,000 square feet) this is patently
absurd, and clearly intended to frighten the homeowner into not
getting, or even repairing, a slate roof,'' Hathaway wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am having a slate roof put on my house (15 square of slate)
for around $5,000, not counting the slate, which would cost between
$3,700 and $6,700. Total cost, around $11,000, or roughly double
(or a little more) the cost of an asphalt roof.''
</P>
<P>
   Hathaway added that a figure of $70,000 should alert you to
fishy-smelling claims of roofing contractors regarding slate.
</P>
<P>
   Good point, Malcolm Hathaway, which leads the handyman to
suggest to T.K. of Brookline that before he does anything, he
should get some more bids. He might luck out and get considerably
lower bids. It is worth a try. And, it is worth a try to seek bids
not to replace the slate, but to remove it and put it back on under
new slate felt. Because, as Hathaway pointed out, most slate will
last hundreds of years, and it would be a shame to throw it all
away.

<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  My bronzeware eating utensils from Thailand are always
tarnished. No matter how often I polish them, within days they are
tarnished again and the food tastes terrible. Any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   KIM MARTIN, San Francisco
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. &LR;  Bronze, like brass and copper, will tarnish if left
unpolished and/or protected with lacquer. Since your bronzeware is
eating utensils, they cannot be lacquered.
</P>
<P>
   So, let them tarnish. This is what they do naturally and you can
consider it an antique bronze look. The fact that the food tastes
terrible after the utensils are polished indicates to me that the
polish, not the bronze, is making the food taste bad.
</P>
<P>
   The only time I suggest polishing the utensils is when you use
them for display, not cooking.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  My concrete birdbath has gotten quite pitted, but is not
leaking. What can I do about that pitting? What caused it? Would a
skimcoat work?
</P>
<P>
   RUTH BOYNTON, Walpole
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. &LR;  There is little you can do about pitting concrete. I don't
think a skimcoat would work; it might become pitted again and/or it
might start to peel off, which would make matters worse. One thing
you might try is to get the bowl nice and clean, then apply a coat
of swimming pool paint; it won't disguise the pitting but it may
prevent further pitting.

   WORKING-CHIC (New York) _ It has become socially unacceptable
not to work, no matter how much money your parents have. Young
women dread being stuck with the label ``socialite,'' or worse, as
middle-aged 1980s-vintage ``ladies who lunch.'' It is the same for
men. Just a generation ago, about half the members of the Racquet &AMP;
Tennis Club, the Park Avenue bastion of male privilege, listed
``gentleman'' or ``sportsman'' as their occupations, members say;
now, there are precious few who fit those descriptions. And most of
them hide it. And yet, despite the fashion for careers, many
children of extreme privilege can't seem to hack it. They lack the
drive and the discipline of their hungrier peers. By Monique P.

<P>
   FASHION-LONDON (Undated) _ Young designers in London are seeking
to capitalize on the dual aspect of the British personality,
devoting their efforts to young women who seemingly want to look
more like Debbie Harry at 25 than Blaine Trump at 41. Stella
McCartney has made a career out of it on her own and now at Chloe,
turning out aristocratically cut trousers inserted with
flesh-revealing rhinestone checkerboards. For the most part though,
the designers who showed in London last week, nearly all of whom
studied at Central St. Martin's College of Art and Design, are
engaged in a different exercise altogether. They want to show you
all the innovative things you can do with a leg o'mutton sleeve or
a draped piece of fabric and a pin. By Ginia Bellafante. WITH

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NITEOUT-BLASS (New York) _ They canceled their plans, dug deep
into their closets for classic gowns and braved a cold February
night in little more than sequins and fur stoles. Nothing could
keep the F.O.B.'s _ that's Friends of Bill Blass _ from a gala on
Wednesday honoring the fashion designer for his 50-plus year
career. By Elizabeth Hayt. WITH PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CYBER-GOLD-TEETH (New York) _ Here I am chatting with my mother
long distance to Florida, no big news, just catching up, when she
hits me with it: ``Hey, want to hear a hot one? I sold my teeth on
eBay. I got $16.'' My mother is 72 and _ how can a daughter put
this nicely? _ she has always been a little wacko. I sit there in
my living room on a Sunday night, stunned, stupefied. I say, ``You
did (italics)what?''(end italics) as if I am in a sitcom. By Joyce
Wadler. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BREAKERS-HOTEL (Palm Beach, Fla.) _ India is so last year.
Africa doesn't interest us anymore, thanks. Right this second? It's
all about Palm Beach, as inspired by Michael Kors' collection for
spring. Magazines are pushing ``postmodern preppy'' and ``country
club chic'' looks as if they were the answer to the question of
existence. So what better way to inhabit the fantasy, even if it
has nothing much to do with my life, than to check into the
Breakers Hotel with my brother, his wife and two little children?
By Bob Morris. &QL;

<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ It is the season for flowers past in
my house. The myriad dried forms and shapes of these elegant echoes
of last year's colorful bounty fill vases with browns, rusts,
purples, tans and silvers. What I especially like about these
arrangements is that the plants have dried themselves, either
naturally outside or as water evaporates in vases inside. They are
the ultimate in easy care, yearlong displays. By Patricia A.

THE RACE FOR THE AMERICA'S CUP IS READY TO BEGIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: This will be updated by 11 p.m. with the results of Race
1.)  
(lh) 
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ After a long week in which tongues, not
sails, were the main things flapping in the breeze, the time for
talking is over. Saturday, under a forecast of clear skies and in
winds that are predicted to hover around 10 knots, the first race
in the five-of-nine America's Cup finals between the local heroes,
Team New Zealand, and the pride of Italy, the Prada Challenge, is
scheduled to begin.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of this cup match, as in most of the 29 that have
preceded it, a touch of controversy has been floating in the air.
But it has been overshadowed by the probing chatter concerning the
one and only question that truly matters: Who is bringing the
faster ride?
</P>
<P>
   The primary bone of contention regarded two proposed additions
to the sailing rules by the cup's current minders, the Royal New
Zealand Yacht Squadron. The Kiwis wished to place an official
observer aboard the boats who would work in concert with the
on-water umpires to make rulings in tight situations. They also
wanted all penalty turns to be executed immediately after a foul, a
change from the challengers' trials when boats were free to
exonerate themselves in most situations at any time during the
course of the race.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians took umbrage to both suggestions, the first on the
grounds that the English-speaking observers would be making calls
in what for many crewmen is their second language, and the second
because in a pre-start situation they felt that the penalty-turn
burden would unfairly affect the outcome of the race. In a
match-race, spotting the opposition an early lead makes a huge and
often fatal difference. And it may well have given the aggressive
New Zealand helmsman Russell Coutts an important edge.
</P>
<P>
   Prada filed a formal request to the cup's International
Arbitration Panel to rule on the dispute. But the larger matter
became moot when a mediator negotiated a compromise between the
camps, and the instigation of immediate penalty turns was
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The observer problem took care of itself when the designated
judges simply refused to board the boats _ they had been delegated
to a spot on the transom under the boat's antennas and other
electronics, and feared the possible exposure to radiation. ``They
had a nice seat, too, right in an electric chair,'' said Prada's
tactician Torben Grael.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of a potentially larger, less toxic issue has yet to
be resolved. In the challengers' trials, no race was started when
winds blew consistently above 18 knots. No lower wind range was
established, but the race committee regularly began races in
breezes below 10 knots.
</P>
<P>
   It has been thought that the Kiwis would relish sailing in
fresher winds, a fact confirmed by the principal race officer
Harold Bennett. But regarding the matter of light-air racing, which
many believe would favor Prada, he remained non-committal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In winds of 7 or 8 knots the conditions can be very shifty and
unstable, and I doubt we'd want to start a race,'' he said. ``At
the top end, if we have 25 knots of southwest wind and flat water,
those are good conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter which way the winds blow, what everyone wishes to know
is which boat will better harness them. Prada's designer, Doug
Peterson, stirred the pot all week, telling anyone within listening
distance that he believed NZL 60, the Kiwi boat, was riddled with
speed-sapping flaws, particularly a ballast bulb with wing in its
center, not aft.
</P>
<P>
   Though Coutts has maintained an incredibly low profile for the
last several weeks, he finally spoke about Peterson's comments at a
Friday press conference, calling the Prada designer's opinion
``disconcerting.'' Coutts added, ``Everyone thinks what we've
chosen is so wrong. I guess we'll have to wait and see whether it
is or not.`
</P>
<P>
   Coutts was less diplomatic when an Italian journalist asked him
why he had skipped a mid-week reception for both crews, and about
reported riffs between the sailors and the administrators behind
the gates of the Kiwi compound. ``I think that's a ridiculous
question,'' he snapped. ``Let's move on.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is impossible to discern the general mood of the New
Zealand sailors, who have gone about the business of preparation in
a secluded, businesslike manner. Those wondering if the Kiwis are
feeling the pressure of their first defense have nothing to go on
but idle speculation.
</P>
<P>
   As for Prada, Rod Davis, the American-born head coach, believes
his crew is ready for whatever lies ahead. ``If there's anything
I've learned about the Italian style, it's that it's understated,''
he said. ``But these guys have proven again and again that they're
a tough bunch. I guarantee that, whatever happens, they won't fall
apart.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no more to be said. The next important sound will be
the starting gun. The answers to all the questions will follow soon
after.

SENIOR INS OFFICIAL ACCUSED OF SPYING FOR CUBA  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A senior official of the Immigration and Naturalization Service
accused of spying for the Cuban government was caught passing on
deliberately leaked classified material a week ago, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation said Friday. Mariano Faget, (pronounced
fah-HAY) 54, a supervisory adjudication officer for the INS, was
arrested in Miami on Thursday by FBI agents after wiretaps and
other surveillance revealed that he allegedly made unauthorized
contacts with Cuban intelligence officers in Miami and other
American cities.
</P>
<P>
   Faget, who had a ``secret'' security clearance, had been,
responsible for overseeing requests for political asylum and other
naturalization decisions, according to the FBI. Such authority
would have let him determine the fate of thousands of Cubans who
fled from their communist-ruled country and applied for asylum in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday morning, Paul E. Mallett, the
assistant special agent in charge of the FBI's operation in Miami,
said that Faget had unauthorized contacts with Cuban intelligence
officers and a Cuban-born businessman in New York City who himself
met several times during the last year with Cuban government
officials and agents. The FBI did not identify the businessman.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 11, Faget became the target of a sting when two FBI
officials visited his Miami office and asked for his assistance in
filling out papers granting asylum to a high-ranking Cuban
intelligence officer who wanted to defect.
</P>
<P>
   Faget was told, Mallett said, ``that the information he was
being entrusted with was secret and was very sensitive, that it
could not be disclosed to anyone, and that the intelligence
community was working on a very short time frame to accomplish
their mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 12 minutes after their meeting ended, Mallett
said, Faget used his personal cellular phone to call the New York
businessman and tell him that a person they both knew was working
with the Americans. After the businessman mentioned two different
names, Faget gave the name of the intelligence operative for whom
he had prepared the documents.
</P>
<P>
   Slightly before 5 p.m., Faget allegedly called the businessman
in New York again, this time from his home telephone, which
apparently was also tapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``He identified again the full name of the individual for whom
he had been asked to prepare the political asylum document,''
Mallett said. ``Faget further stated that the individual was in
fact a Cuban intelligence operative.''
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the seriousness of the case, Mallett said that the
kind of information disclosed by Faget could harm the United States
because it exposed the American counter-intelligence effort against
Cuba and could be used by Havana to cut off access to human sources
of intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Due to his position, Faget had access to classified and
sensitive INS files relating to confidential law enforcement
sources and Cuban defectors,'' the FBI said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The INS said Faget had been placed on administrative leave and
that the agency was cooperating with the FBI investigation.
Thursday night and Friday, FBI agents searched Faget's white
two-story house in Miami's Kendall suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Faget worked for the INS for 34 years. He has been described as
the highest ranking Hispanic official in the immigration agency's
South Florida district.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Herald reported Friday that Faget was born in Havana
and immigrated to the United States with his father in 1960. He
became an American citizen on Nov. 22, 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Faget is being charged with violating the Espionage Act by
``communicating national defense information to an unauthorized
person'' and with making false statements.
</P>
<P>
   Faget was taken to the Federal Detention Center in Miami
following his arrest.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The last major investigation into Cuban spying in the United
States was in 1998 when 10 suspected Cuban agents were arrested and
indicted in Miami. They were charged with trying to infiltrate
military bases and Cuban exile organizations in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In December of 1998, three months after the arrests in Miami,
the United States expelled three Cuban diplomats at the United
Nations, accusing them of spying, as well. Officials said the three
men were linked to espionage case in Miami, but because they held
diplomatic immunity they were not prosecuted.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the season for flowers past in my house. The myriad dried
forms and shapes of these elegant echoes of last year's colorful
bounty fill vases with browns, rusts, purples, tans and silvers.
</P>
<P>
   What I especially like about these arrangements is that the
plants have dried themselves, either naturally outside or as water
evaporates in vases inside. They are the ultimate in easy care,
yearlong displays.
</P>
<P>
   Many are flowers from popular garden stalwarts: the thick brown
umbrellas formed by Autumn Joy sedum flowers; the dark brown,
almost black, wiry stems and dotted seedheads of Moonbeam
coreopsis; the slim, medium brown miniature tulip forms of Siberian
iris seedpods; the silvery white flower sprays of Silver King
artemisia; the rich brown pyramidal flower forms of astilbes; and
the blackish button pompon seedheads of black-eyed Susans and
coneflowers.
</P>
<P>
   Others are not as well known, though just as carefree and
striking. They add further variety in form and color to my
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   The dried flower heads of Turkestan onion (Allium karataviense)
are two to three inches in diameter and resemble exploding balls of
fireworks displays. Tiny, pale tan flowers edge the tips, with even
smaller black seeds tucked inside.
</P>
<P>
   The plant is an unusual allium in that it is often grown for its
thick, hostalike foliage rather than for its balls of pinkish white
flowers that open in May. The bluish green leaves, two to five
inches wide and six inches long, arch out and hug the ground, while
the flowers stand on 6- to 10-inch stems for up to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   I periodically check the flower heads three or four weeks after
their rosy flush of bloom and cut them shortly before a brisk wind
can blow them away. By the end of July, the entire plant is dormant
in my central New Jersey borders.
</P>
<P>
   The flowers on the fall-blooming hairy golden aster (Chrysopsis
villosa) dry into warm tan buttons about one inch in diameter.
These pair handsomely with the similarly shaped but dark brown
seedheads of black-eyed Susans and coneflowers.
</P>
<P>
   Though the popular name of this aster relative is unattractive,
the plant itself is charming and decorates late season gardens with
one- to two-inch-wide rich yellow flowers that top one- to
three-foot stems. Outside, the flowers disappear with time and
frost. In arrangements, however, they hold for a week or more and
then, as the petals drop, metamorphose into dried creations
resembling fuzzy balls.
</P>
<P>
   Flat, wine-purple flower clusters that form 5- to 10-inch-wide
bouquets of tightly packed one-quarter-inch asters are the dried
hallmarks of ironweed (Vernonia noveboracensis). I use this large _
up to 12-feet tall _ perennial as a privacy screen throughout
summer and then enjoy its crown of fall flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Through sheer serendipity (my husband says laziness), I found
that the flowers not only naturally dry out when water evaporates
in a vase but also hold their color. Flowers left on the plants
outdoors lose theirs.
</P>
<P>
   The dried purple flower heads are quite colorful for at least a
year and look especially handsome in pewter vases. I combine them
with the silver gray flower heads of Silver King artemesia and the
creamy white dried clusters of pearly everlasting (Anaphalis
yedoensis) flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Pearly everlasting, a two- to three-foot tall perennial, is not
widely grown. While it is not a knockout in the garden, I keep it
for its silvery foliage and its easily dried creamy white fall
flowers. Pearly everlasting lives up to its popular name. The
plants dry on their own outside or in vases inside and hold their
form for years. Each dried stem is tipped with clusters of
one-half-inch-wide flowers with soft tan centers skirted by pearly
white edges.
</P>
<P>
   The delicate, bleached tan sprays of switch grass (Panicum
virgatum) are stunning when tucked in among darker, heavier dried
flowers such as those from astilbes and Autumn Joy sedums. At first
glance, it almost appears as if a spider had been weaving a
fountain spray web among the other plant materials.
</P>
<P>
   My sprays come from a three-foot-tall cultiver known as Heavy
Metal, which is prized for its sturdiness and bluish green stems.
It's a handsome filler in a border featuring cool blues and whites.
The grass dries naturally and can be picked for dried arrangements
as late as December.
</P>
<P>
   All these plants thrive in ordinary, well-drained soil in full
sun to bright, partial shade. They flourish without fertilizers and
are not bothered by pests or diseases. There's another bonus: they
are all drought resistant.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps I should stop calling them flowers past and start
calling them flowers future. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All the above plants but Turkestan onion can be ordered this
spring for flowering and drying this year. Turkestan onions can be
ordered and planted this fall.
</P>

YOUNG LONDON DESIGNERS ATTRACT A NEW FASHION CLIENTELE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., Feb. 20)  
(jt) 
 By GINIA BELLAFANTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ On Wednesday, the fourth day of London Fashion Week,
the Evening Standard devoted half of its front page to a story
about a leaked medical report concerning Pinochet's health (the
headline in inch-and-a-half type read: ``Pinochet `Now Has Brain
Damage'''). The other side had a full-length picture of Posh Spice
walking down the runway for a young designer named Maria Grachvogel
in a sleeveless turtleneck and shorts.
</P>
<P>
   Had you deplaned in the land of the people's princess last week,
without any prior exposure to British habits, a glance at the paper
would have told you all you needed to know about a culture that is
as proud of its commitment to the meaningful and high-minded as it
is unembarrassed by its worship of the tasteless and absurd.
</P>
<P>
   The chic young London women who fill the front rows at the
collections here _ the Brooke de Ocampo equivalents _ don't show up
in knee-length cashmere skirts and sling-backs and sit quietly,
ankles crossed, hands joined in a hushed clap. They wear track
shoes; they strut in tight jeans and heels; they hunch over; they
throw their arms in the air and smoke throughout the shows, as Jade
Jagger managed to at Julien Macdonald's Millennium Dome spectacle
on Thursday night, even though security guards were scolding others
to put their cigarettes out.
</P>
<P>
   It would make sense that young designers in London might want to
capitalize on the dual aspect of the British personality, devoting
their efforts to young women who seemingly want to look more like
Debbie Harry at 25 than Blaine Trump at 41. Stella McCartney has
made a career out of it on her own and now at Chloe, turning out
aristocratically cut trousers inserted with flesh-revealing
rhinestone checkerboards.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part though, the young designers who showed in
London last week, nearly all of whom studied at Central St.
Martin's College of Art and Design, are engaged in a different
exercise altogether. They want to show you all the innovative
things you can do with a leg o'mutton sleeve or a draped piece of
fabric and a pin. They are like figure skaters, so intent on
executing one triple axle after another that they forget the judges
dole out two scores, and only one is based on technique.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of this mood, London has produced Hussein Chalayan,
unparalleled among young designers anywhere, as someone who is a
sort of one-man think tank, a philosopher and engineer, artist and
showman, with a lot to say on the ways in which objects can
transform, but never define us. You leave one of Chalayan's shows
feeling as you do after one of Geoffrey Beene's. Suddenly, all the
other people who call themselves designers seem to be little more
than stylists.
</P>
<P>
   On a stark white stage at the Sadler's Wells Theater in
Islington, Chalayan set up a round coffee table surrounded by four
1950s-style armchairs. Near that set and behind a scrim stood a
group of Bulgarian singers. The show had all the ingredients of
pretension. Yet what evolved, as models came forth, left the
audience so moved that many seated felt almost offended when
Chalayan did not take a customary bow at the end of the show. They
genuinely wanted to express something back.
</P>
<P>
   After a parade of beautiful clothes _ a strapless hoop dress of
tulle florets, which was made by a sculptor, black-and-white suits
and coats with blossoming lapels _ he accomplished what might
become one of the most memorable finales of any fashion show. Four
models stood behind the armchairs, removed the slipcovers and put
them on, converting them into narrow, apron-front, knee- and
calf-length dresses. Then a fifth model emerged, who removed a disk
from the center of the coffee table, stepped into the hole and
pulled the table up to her waist, creating a Chinese lantern
effect. The wooden table became a tiered hoop skirt. The chairs, as
it happened, folded up into thin suitcases.
</P>
<P>
   Back stage after the show, Chalayan, politely answered the
questions of a French television host. No, the show was not about
traveling with furniture, he said, but if that's what a person took
away, that was fine, too.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to know what to take away from Alexander McQueen's
show on Tuesday night. Last season, when McQueen showed in New
York, it was the hurricane with which he had to contend. This
season, a handful of unintimidating teen-age protesters from a
group called London Animal Action stood outside with small signs
that read ``Fur Hurts.'' Dozens of bobbies surrounded them. Getting
into the show, held in the most trite of venues, a damp warehouse,
required that guests hand their bags over to security guards to be
searched. There were rumors that there had been a bomb scare the
night before the show. There were other rumors that McQueen was
planning to blow up a house during his show. Nothing was blown up,
though a hoop-skirted, distressed denim dress that came down the
runway was splattered, pointlessly, with what appeared to be
explosive debris that was probably liquified clay.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting through the McQueen show felt like eavesdropping on a
young man's therapy session, as he tried to work out very
complicated feelings about his mother. McQueen never makes it all
that easy for his models to travel the runway, but this time his
treatment of them bordered on cruelty. They had to walk over
piled-up slate in staggeringly high wedge-heeled boots. McQueen's
clothes are not known for their featherweight, and the models
looked as though they were about to fall over. One model was also
forced to wear a metal mouthpiece with jutting spears that
stretched her lips from the top of her nose to the bottom of her
chin. Some in the audience turned their heads unable to look.
</P>
<P>
   All the discomfort McQueen was so desperately trying to create
almost eclipsed the exceptional in his show. And there was much
that was exceptional _ a dress made of molded cane on top and
sculpted roses on the bottoieved the status of art. There
were exquisite wearable pieces, too, including a brown opera coat
with a cinched waist and exaggerated lapels.
</P>
<P>
   The night before that show, Arkadius, a young Polish designer,
proved that he was trying to be the next McQueen, when he really
didn't have to. He forged a distinctive style with tubular pillows
that followed the body's curves. He did not need to send models
down the runway, McQueen-style in masks. Nor did he need to come
out at the end of his show with his head wrapped in a black hood,
carrying a plastic replica of himself with a bloodied neck. Nothing
remotely similar went on at Paul Smith's show Monday night. Smith
presented little that wasn't wearable and luxuriously made. Leather
skirts were lined with hand-embroidered Chinese silk. Sequined
jackets, the material for which arrived from Pakistan four hours
before the show, would cost, Smith joked, ``the price of a small
Ferrari.''
</P>
<P>
   The prices have been more reasonable at Burberry, where the
Italian in charge, Roberto Manichetti, turned out his best
collection of women's wear so far. ``This is war,'' Manichetti said
of his efforts to give the house the imprimatur of hip. Lately, the
Burberry plaid has been referenced not only in a painting by Damien
Loeb, but in the creations of a young New York designer Miguel
Androver and a young English designer Russell Sage, who showed this
week in a collection called ``So Sue Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Manichetti showed great leather jackets and a wrap skirt of
cashmere and leather, as well as others bearing patterns of the
Italian Mila Schoen from the 1960s. Surely, Jade Jagger could
imagine lighting up in any one of them.

 By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Starting in the management training program at Chase
Manhattan Bank didn't turn out exactly the way one 29-year-old
Upper East Sider expected.
</P>
<P>
   In the five years since she'd graduated from college, she had
been supported in Manhattan by her family and spent her days
volunteering as an organizer of parties for charities.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly, among her friends, it was no longer acceptable for
young adults not to work. All the glittering Park Avenue princesses
were touting their serious day jobs. It was chic to have a career.
The young woman asked her father, a prominent financier, to help
find her a position. Daddy, as she refers to him, talked to golfing
friends at the Round Hill country club in Greenwich, Conn., and
within two weeks she was in at the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The chicness wore off fast.
</P>
<P>
   When she started, in March 1998, supervisors informed her of the
dress code: replace those puffy Agnes B. skirts and Chanel flats
with dark suits, classic pumps with one-inch heels, with stockings.
She complied, though she found stockings ``especially middle
class.'' She was told to limit personal calls, and so she made her
party plans after work. She obeyed what she called the bank's
``silly'' rules, but then summer approached and she informed her
supervisor that her family traditionally took a three-month
vacation in the south of France.
</P>
<P>
   She was told she could have one week off.
</P>
<P>
   ``One week?'' said the woman (whose fear of ridicule led her to
ask for anonymity). ``That was so ridiculous. That's not even
enough time to shop.''
</P>
<P>
   When she returned to the office three months later, in
mid-September, she found, not surprisingly, that she was out of a
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire experience was a shock,'' the woman said the other
day. ``I had never been around that many middle-class people all in
one room. It was dreadful. They were mean and jealous and expected
me to miss out on all our family fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Pity the adult children of the modern leisure class.
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK, don't pity them _ but at least try to see it their way
for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   Raised with unlimited charge-card privileges and BMW's for their
16th birthdays, they knew early on that they would not have to work
for a living. Their parents bought them apartments when they turned
21 and endowed trust funds to provide for cash flow. The
post-debutantes thought nothing of flying to London for a party in
a suite at Claridge's, or to a disco on Ibiza, or drifting through
India for a Merchant &AMP; Ivory month.
</P>
<P>
   But now it has become socially unacceptable not to work, no
matter how much money your parents have. Young women dread being
stuck with the label ``socialite,'' or worse, as middle-aged
1980s-vintage ``ladies who lunch.'' It is the same for men. Just a
generation ago, about half the members of the Racquet &AMP; Tennis
Club, the Park Avenue bastion of male privilege, listed
``gentleman'' or ``sportsman'' as their occupations, members say;
now, there are precious few who fit those descriptions. And most of
them hide it.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, despite the fashion for careers, many children of
extreme privilege can't seem to hack it. They lack the drive and
the discipline of their hungrier peers. They get frustrated easily
when confronted with setbacks, and grow angry at the need to defer
immediate pleasures. They job-hop, throw tantrums and have a tough
time relating to people who come from different backgrounds (and
almost everybody does).
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the kids I grew up with are still stuck doing the
same things they were doing in high school _ partying every night,
not working terribly hard, traveling a lot,'' said Noel Ashman, 29,
an owner of the nightclub Veruka, where many of his former
private-school buddies congregate. ``They are dressed in Prada and
Armani now and don't really worry about how they're going to wake
up for work the next morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Many have tried working, he said, ``but when it gets difficult,
they won't stick it out because they don't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Tara Peters, 28, an artist, attended private schools in
Manhattan and, after college, moved to Paris for six years, before
returning to New York. ``It's unacceptable to say you don't work,''
she said. ``Work is a definition on how you spend your time. If you
don't work, and you don't have to work, you eventually look like a
dummy who lunches.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Buhl, 30, who grew up in New York and Switzerland, has
briefly held jobs as a temp at a stock brokerage in Boston and as a
trainee at a brokerage in London. He left, he said, when he became
bored. Most recently he worked for an uncle on building sites in
Palm Beach. That, too, he found tedious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked it in the beginning, but it got a little boring,
repetitive,'' he said hesitantly. ``I didn't like the people. There
was nothing wrong with them, but there are a lot of rednecks down
there.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I got tired of Palm Beach. It got dull.''
</P>
<P>
   Buhl returned to New York, where he has many friends who are
supported by their families. They call themselves artists, he said,
or hop from job to job. ``Some of my friends are brats,'' he said.
``Some are just looking for new and exciting experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Buhl's father, Henry Buhl, a retired mutual fund manager and a
philanthropist, laments that all three of his grown children lack
career ambitions. ``None of them seem to have any work ethic,'' he
said. A second son, 35, has had three jobs in a year and lives to
crew on sailboats. His daughter, 36, lives in Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   They have many contemporaries in the same position. ``This is a
flighty group from New York and Switzerland,'' Henry Buhl said, ``I
won't mention names, but there are so many kids of rich people who
are given too much money and too much freedom and are `cool' and
haven't been handled properly.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   To force his own children to take responsibility, Buhl said, he
stopped giving them money a few years ago, but they have
independent incomes from their grandparents. The family patriarch,
Louis Mendelssohn, was a wealthy architect and builder in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Buhl, who said he did not come into family money until
later in life, worked his way up on Wall Street. Today he lives in
a 4,500-square-foot loft in SoHo, with a dome over the entry
painted to look like a Renaissance mosaic. It is no small paradox
that Buhl is the founder of the SoHo Partnership, which helps
homeless people find jobs as well as housing. Participants are paid
$6 an hour to clean the streets while being trained to dress and
speak well in interviews to win jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Buhl said his program has helped more than 200 people find
employment since 1992, but he has been unable to help his own
children. ``My kids should be in the program, but they are not
hopeless enough,'' he said. ``You have to be desperate to make my
program work.''
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that he bears some responsibility for his children's
aimlessness. ``I guess I shouldn't have give them such a high
life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard, no doubt, to work up much sympathy for this segment
of the trust-fund set, especially when so many others in their age
group are working 70-hour weeks on the lower rungs of law firms or
banks or as Internet entrepreneurs. They manage to delay
gratification on their climb to the top, which also teaches lessons
in dealing with people, both superiors and subordinates, from
diverse backgrounds.

   At least one 27-year-old woman who grew up in a wealthy and
socially prominent family, on the other hand, never stayed long
enough in a sales job she took, at a corporation in Midtown, to
experience the world outside her Baccarat bubble. If she had, she
might have lost what seems to be an ingrained snobbery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to people who took four trains from God knows
where to get to work, who didn't understand that my job did not
come first,'' said the woman, who did not want to be named.
``Certainly it didn't for $37,000 a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Her immediate manager, she recounted, rolled her eyes when she
came in late, grunted when she took three-hour networking lunches
and finally put her foot down when she wanted to take an unpaid
vacation to go to the Paris couture shows. After 18 months, she
quit. She now works for her family, helping to invest its fortune.
She goes to a family office when she is so inclined and where the
employees, all on the family payroll, can't boss her around.
</P>
<P>
   Such cases may seem extreme, easy to tsk-tsk over; but a sense
of entitlement coupled with a lack of discipline is also a growing
problem for young people from less lofty strata, some
psychotherapists and child experts say. The term Affluenza has been
popularized by one therapist, Jessie H. O'Neill of Milwaukee, to
describe how values are distorted by too much money. Merrill Lynch
offers advisers who help clients teach their children the
responsibilities that come with wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pamela Sicher, a psychiatrist in private practice on the
Upper East Side, said: ``We have more and more children that are
having trouble finding personal reasons to work hard at their own
goals. Many feel that they will passively inherit, if not money, a
work life, and this type of thing tends to stifle creativity and
drive.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``A lack of focus, a lack of direction and a lack of
drive is a problem that has increased in frequency among the young
20-somethings and 30-somethings, who are now going to therapists.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert C. Elliott, an executive vice president at the Bessemer
Trust Co., which manages trusts for individuals (minimum fund: $5
million), said the latest wave of the newly wealthy is learning
from past mistakes in giving money to children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents are recognizing the potential problem and delaying the
time when their children would actually receive money in order to
not have it serve as a disincentive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After their children's educations are paid for, he said parents
now typically ``buy a house, give them money to start a business,
but don't let them get their hands on the big money.'' These
children come into their legacy in stages, at the ages of 30, 35 or
40, and some parents even require offspring to pass drug tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work ethic is hampered by access to money at too young an
age,'' Elliott said. ``It's hard for someone who has several
million dollars, which produces income of over $100,000, or so to
be interested in a job that pays $40,000.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately they become less committed to their career than
their peers, which obviously produces less success in their career
and ultimately less satisfaction with their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, trust funds have a habit of running out, especially in the
second or third generation.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Kravitz admitted that he grew up as a spoiled brat in and
around New York. His artist mother, Brenda Kravitz, and his father,
Philip L. Kravitz, the owner of a very profitable insurance
brokerage, had homes in New Jersey and off Sutton Place in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically had whatever I wanted,'' Kravitz said. That
included, during Christmas vacations in Palm Beach, his own room at
the Breakers hotel with a stocked bar, which made him popular with
the junior social set there. When he was 19, he had his own
Manhattan condominium. ``Basically I was so unruly my parents
thought it would be easier for me to have my own apartment,'' he
said. ``You know, so I wouldn't mess up the pillows.''
</P>
<P>
   He partied through college (he attended several) and kept on
partying all the way into his 30s. When he left school, he took a
job at his father's company, Kalvin Miller International, one of
the top insurance brokerages in the country. When his father sold
it, the new owners politely told him, he recalled, that he would
always have a job there but that since he didn't work hard he would
not advance far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was full of arrogance and conceit and felt there were plenty
of opportunities for me,'' Kravitz said. ``I didn't show up in the
office when I was supposed to. I was very unruly.''
</P>
<P>
   He was clubbing nightly. He recalled thinking that the norms
that guided most peoples' careers and behavior didn't apply, thanks
to the great cushion that wealth provided. ``There's a degree of
snobbery,'' he said. ``You say to yourself, `I'm different from
everyone else.' You say, `I'm better than everyone else.'''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Especially in the New York scene, there is such
tremendous affluence and you're surrounded by so many affluent
friends, you kind of think you'll always be taken care of. You feel
you have all this privilege and it's almost a right of passage that
you will succeed. You think that everything will come magically and
easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Between the ages of 23 and 28, Kravitz held four jobs. He quit
three and was fired from one. At one point he moved to London to
try developing real estate, but got discouraged and returned home.
</P>
<P>
   In moments of introspection, he recognized that he was deeply
unhappy with his inability to sustain a career, or even a long-term
relationship. He saw how the heavy use of drugs and alcohol among
his set was an attempt, as he put it, ``to medicate these awful
feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Kravitz became depressed over his lack of direction, and
considered suicide. ``My life just stopped working the way it
was,'' he said. ``I had no clue about how to focus on work. I saw
my life standing still while friends were getting married, were
getting promoted at work.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of worry for his son, his father, who died last year, had
him go work at another of company he owned, Global Risk Management,
which audits workers' compensation insurance. ``I had to grow up
and I had to learn how to work and have responsibility,'' Kravitz
said. He said he now goes to an office all day, almost every day,
got married, Now, at 33, he says he has turned his life around.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who really matter, the people who I respect,'' he
said, ``I've earned their respect now.''

WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION OFFICIAL OPTIMISTIC ABOUT CHINA'S
MEMBERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (js)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The head of the World Trade Organization said Friday
that he was optimistic that China can enter the trade body this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely hopeful that negotiations will be concluded and
agreed by the various members this year,'' said Mike Moore, chief
of the trade organization, at a news conference here Friday
afternoon. Moore met with China's prime minister, Zhu Rongji, and
the foreign trade minister, Shi Guangsheng.
</P>
<P>
   Moore also made clear that China must enter the WTO before
Taiwan does. China, which considers Taiwan a renegade province, has
warned that any efforts to secure Taiwan's earlier entry would
cause a serious confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said the issue was settled in 1992 by the predecessor
organization, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which
said China would join first, then Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   A WTO official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that
Taiwan's reported fear that China, once in the body, could keep
Taiwan out, was unjustified, Reuters reported Friday. The official
said there would be a 30-day period after China ratifies its
accession before it becomes a member. During this period, the
official said, Taiwan could sign its own accession documents.
</P>
<P>
   To placate Chinese concerns about granting Taiwan national
status, the island will enter under the name ``China-Taipei,'' with
the status of a ``customs territory,'' officials of the trade group
have said.
</P>
<P>
   China still needs to reach agreements with 14 trade organization
members before it can join. It has already reached agreements with
the United States, Japan and Canada, and on Monday negotiations
with the European Union will resume here.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans are reportedly pushing to deepen the concessions
China has made to the United States in the areas of insurance,
telecommunications and automobiles, an official said. Concessions
granted to one party, like the European Union, apply to all member
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Trade officials believe that once the major economic powers
reach accords with China, the remaining countries, mainly Latin
American and Asian, will quickly come to terms.
</P>
<P>
   Two or three months of technical negotiations among member
countries are then expected at the WTO headquarters in Geneva.
Topics would include phase-in periods of new rules for China and
the elimination of non-tariff barriers not already covered.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Chinese and international trade officials are nervously watching
the congressional debate on granting China permanent normal trade
relations status, as President Clinton has proposed. A stiff battle
is expected this spring.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, China can join the WTO even if Congress refuses to
cooperate, and Congress could renew China's trade status each year.
But a negative vote in Congress on permanent trade relations would
cause uncertainty and confusion, international trade officials say,
leading China to deny benefits to the United States that it grants
to other countries, or even to delay its accession to the world
body.

 FINDING THE TOOTH FAIRY ON eBAY  
(For release Sun., Feb. 20) 
(jt) 
 By JOYCE WADLER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here I am chatting with my mother long distance to Florida, no
big news, just catching up, when she hits me with it:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, want to hear a hot one? I sold my teeth on eBay. I got
$16.''
</P>
<P>
   My mother is 72 and _ how can a daughter put this nicely? _ she
has always been a little wacko. She swiped trees from state
preserves when I was a kid, saying her tax dollars had paid for
them anyway. She lines up with the college kids during spring break
in Daytona Beach to get a free sample of anything. There isn't too
much she can do to surprise me or, more to the point, embarrass me,
but this one just knocks me out.
</P>
<P>
   I sit there in my living room on a Sunday night, stunned,
stupefied. I say, ``You did  &UR; what &LR; ?'' as if I am in a sitcom. Then
we get into the why. ``Why did you sell your teeth on eBay, Ma?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know all that work I was having on my teeth?'' Ma says.
``The dentist took out this bridge, and there was some gold, and he
said, `You know, you could probably get a few bucks for these.' So
I put them on eBay and sold them.'' Laughing now. ``What do you
think? I think it's a riot.''
</P>
<P>
   You know when I said there was nothing more my mother could do
to embarrass me? I may not be so evolved as I think, for I feel
it's very important to say right away about selling her teeth, that
my mother doesn't need the money. This is a woman who bought IBM at
$11 in a slump in 1993 and who has begun, as they say in Florida,
to divest.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it is about the money. My mother once sold
real estate and antiques. Now she sells antique postcards. It's the
art of the deal with her, but as luck would have it, she's not
dealing Manhattan real estate. She's dealing a four-tooth bridge
that she no longer needs. But the game is the same. I can see that
the minute the dentist, joking with Ma as he put in some new
crowns, told her she might get a few bucks for her old teeth, that
was it, those teeth were going to be in play.
</P>
<P>
   And my mother is not one of those sweet old widows who don't
know their way around computers. My mother is wired. She's got a
Web site for her postcard business, she's got a scanner and she was
sending me musical birthday cards when I didn't have the software
to open them or the hardware to hear them.
</P>
<P>
   Her boyfriend, George, who lives with her, is studying computer
repair, and the screened porch is littered with so many computer
carcasses that it looks like a Booth cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   I'm clear now on why my mother sold her teeth on eBay. What I
don't understand is who would buy them. A metal dealer? A jeweler?
Or creepier, a ``Silence of the Lambs'' type collector of body
parts?
</P>
<P>
   I am also feeling upset by the idea of my mother's teeth out
there in cyberspace: the words that have passed over those teeth,
the intimate familial discussions. Although as I think about it,
they may not even be Ma's home-grown. My mother said she sold a
bridge. But why would artificial teeth have gold fillings?
</P>
<P>
   Off to eBay I go and type in the word ``teeth.'' More than 400
matches come up: ``tiger teeth,'' ``bear teeth.'' The search is too
broad.
</P>
<P>
   I refine my search to ``gold teeth.'' Victory! There is a photo
of a human tooth, almost entirely gold, and the bidding is at $36.
This is not Ma's tooth.
</P>
<P>
   I call Ma back, partly because I want the satisfaction of
telling her she sold too low, partly to find out where her ad,
which she said would still be displayed, is hiding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, of course it's not under `teeth,''' Ma says. ``What sort
of a person would list anything under `teeth'? It's under
`collectibles, metals.' I'll give you the number if you can't find
it.''
</P>
<P>
   I type the number, 224788832, and sure enough, there's my
mother's ad: ``Here are 4 adult teeth as best as I can describe
them. They are capped with gold. I wonder if this is a first for
eBay? It sure is for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The high bidder _ the only bidder _ is somebody called Luxor.
</P>
<P>
   It's an interesting tag, Luxor. It makes me think of Egypt,
archaeology, gold treasures. I could call Luxor, whom I perceive,
for some reason, as male. My mother has his address, it would be
easy enough to get his phone number, but I put it off. I want to
wait for the check to clear, and although I interview people for a
living, I am not sure what I would say. Finally, after a few weeks,
I get up my nerve and send Luxor an e-mail message, which seems the
correct way to proceed: ``My name is Joyce Wadler, I'm a reporter
at The New York Times, and if my last name sounds familiar, it's
because you obtained, at auction, four of my mother's teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   And of course, a question or two about why.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the reply comes back from a Laurence Lindberg:
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I do have a certain interest in the macabre, I can
usually restrain my enthusiasm for old dental work,'' it reads in
part. ``I bought your mother's teeth strictly for the possible gold
content, taking a small risk in doing so due to the inept
description.'' A bit insensitive, I think.
</P>
<P>
   And, ``Why are your mother's teeth for sale, anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   Luxor, as I still think of him, is, frankly, shaping up to me as
a little grumpy, perhaps because Ma's teeth have not yet arrived,
and when I call him up the next day, he still seems a little
crabby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, I'm Joyce, the person whose mother sold her teeth on
eBay,'' I begin, feeling awkward, because there is no way to
discuss your mother's selling her teeth and seem suave, and before
I'm finished, Luxor interrupts.
</P>
<P>
   ``She shouldn't have,'' he says sternly. ``It wasn't a good way.
They weren't tested or weighed. The only way anyone would buy them
would be if they could get them cheap. If she had taken them
someplace, she would have gotten a better price. At $16, the teeth
probably have somewhere between $35 and $60 worth of gold in them,
which is a handsome profit.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've done this before,'' I say.
</P>
<P>
   Luxor, who lives in Richmond, warms up and gives me the story of
his life: he's 45, married with children, runs an antique clothing
store called Luxor and studied anthropology at Virginia
Commonwealth University. In the late '70s, Luxor got involved in
scrap metal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silver and gold prices were quite high,'' Luxor says. ``Gold
eventually got up as high as $850 an ounce _ now it's $310. Silver
prices got up as high as $60 an ounce _ now it's $5. The Hunt
brothers were trying to corner the silver market, and that made a
bump in the gold. I'd been going around to the antique clothing
stores, buying gold and silver things that were actually priced at
less than their weight that I would sell as scrap. There's a lot of
gold and silver stuff that's not marked. For instance, there was a
particular kind of pin produced in Colombia, an orchid, always in
18-karat gold, that weighed about 20 grams. At that time, that
would be $400.''
</P>
<P>
   Luxor, anyway, does not make a business of buying gold teeth. A
half dozen or so come his way every year in the antique clothing
business, often in jewelry boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A jewelry box is a reasonable place to put something of value
you don't have immediate use for,'' Luxor says. ``There's often a
stray crown. It does accumulate, and once a year or so, I bundle it
up and take it to a refinery. Usually, when I take in a lot,
jewlery and teeth, it's about six ounces of various grades that
usually yields about three ounces of pure gold, which is about
$1,500.''
</P>
<P>
   A fake tooth, a crown, might contain gold?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes,'' Luxor says. ``It's not corrosive. It can be in the
mouth forever. It's very durable. A crown might look like
porcelain, but inside it, it would be gold.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Luxor does not usually buy metals on line, because it's
difficult to know what he's buying. In a shop, he explains, ``you
can capitalize on other people's ignorance, you can handle objects,
taste them, smell them, you can tell what they are.'' ( &UR; Taste &LR; 
them! Oh, no! A strange man tasting my mother's teeth!) But he has
had good luck in the metals category of eBay. He bought (for $42) a
lot of Georgian sterling silver spoons (value, $350) from a fellow
who thought they were plate. Cruising through metals again, Luxor
found Ma's teeth, the first teeth he has ever bought on line. Yes,
he will remove the gold himself. When the teeth arrive he will take
them outside and smash them with a hammer on the sidewalk, so he
doesn't get porcelain fragments all over the shop.
</P>
<P>
   I'm starting to feel as if I know Luxor. He's not unlike my
mother when it comes to the joy of the deal, so I share.
</P>
<P>
   It makes me melancholy to think of my mother's teeth being
smashed on the sidewalk, I tell Luxor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you like, you may think of me doing it delicately at the
jewelry bench,'' Luxor says.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that testing thing,'' I say elliptically. How will Luxor
be testing my mother's teeth?
</P>
<P>
   ``With a kit.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a relief.
</P>
<P>
   I have toyed with the notion of buying back Ma's teeth, and
Luxor is willing. But I decide against it on philosophical grounds:
ultimately are we all not gold nuggets or discard to be smashed on
the metaphorical sidewalk? And what would I do with four old teeth?
I step aside to let the mighty river of e-commerce flow on
unobstructed, and a few days later I receive an e-mail dispatch,
jubilant in tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi _ Your mom's teeth came today, and I'm afraid that she
didn't do as well as she could have. The gold in the teeth weighed
7.5 grams, which is about 5 pennyweights. It is about 20 K or 83
percent pure. This works out to 1/5th of an ounce of pure gold,
which at $283 per ounce is $56.87. A scrap buyer would have paid
about 70 percent of that or $39.81. Of course, to do that, she
would have had to separate out the gold and take it to someone who
would buy it, both of which she might have found distasteful. As it
was, she got to sell them through a medium that she was comfortable
with and didn't have to deal directly with anyone sleazy enough to
buy old teeth. Perhaps it was worth the $23 difference.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Not the world's most enchanting city, Tokyo has never
looked so good as in ``100 Famous Views of Edo,'' a series of color
woodblock prints made in the mid-19th century by the Japanese
master Utagawa Hiroshige (1797-1858). The series (there are
actually 120) was begun in 1856 by the artist and ended with his
death. It includes a few post-mortem prints by his disciple
Shigenobu.
</P>
<P>
   Produced with superb craftsmanship and many stylistic
innovations, the prints celebrate a flourishing Tokyo (known as Edo
until 1868) a few years after Commodore Matthew Perry opened
isolationist Japan to the West and just before the onset of the
Meiji period, which propelled the country into modernity.
</P>
<P>
   The prints, among the best that deal with popular subject matter
in the woodblock medium known as ukiyo-e (``the floating world''),
have had a lasting effect on Western art. Their compositional
innovations have reverberated in the works of Impressionists and
Post-Impressionists, notably Monet, van Gogh and Whistler.
</P>
<P>
   A fine first-edition set, one of only six complete sets known,
was given to the Brooklyn Museum in 1930 by an all but anonymous
collector, Anna Ferris. Bound as an album, it languished largely
unnoticed before it was ``discovered'' by the department of Asian
art in 1979 and transferred to its renowned collection of Japanese
woodblock prints. The set was reproduced in a full-color catalog by
George Braziller in 1986 before its first showing at the museum in
1987.
</P>
<P>
   Now is as good a time as any, the museum figured, to display the
prints again. The current installation, roomy and well planned, was
organized by Amy G. Poster, curator of Asian art. And Braziller has
re-issued its knockout catalog, with commentary on each plate by
Henry D. Smith II, professor of Japanese history at Columbia
University, and essays by Smith and Poster.
</P>
<P>
   The catalog illustrates the prints in just about their actual
size. Still, no catalog, even Braziller's ambitious endeavor, could
capture the full flavor of these artfully composed sheets, with
subtle gradations in color, nuances of texture and other effects
that Hiroshige was able to coax from the cherry woodblock after a
lifetime of honing his talent and technical skills.
</P>
<P>
   People, trees, temples, roads, bridges, mountains, water, boats,
flora, fauna and weather animate these sometimes ebullient,
sometimes laid-back scenes. There are distant views of Mount Fuji
and a close-up of horses' behinds; serene temple compounds and the
busy patterns of women's clothes; earthlings and winged creatures
like eagles and egrets; festivals, fireworks, pageants and
performances. In the tradition of meisho, the classic literary
convention in which places of poetic association were commemorated,
each print is tuned to a season.
</P>
<P>
   The largest number of prints (42) _ is grouped under spring, by
Japanese tradition the first three months of the lunar year, a time
for celebrating the New Year and viewing floral blossoms. There are
scenes like a New Year's celebration on the slope known as
Kasumigaseki with kites dancing in the sky; two geisha returning
home tipsy past a row of cotton merchants' shops; spectators
watching the glow of dawn at a shrine.
</P>
<P>
   The most spectacular is ``Plum Estate, Kameido,'' a close-up
view of Edo's most famous tree, the ``Sleeping Dragon Plum,'' whose
drooping branches rerooted themselves in the ground to produce new
trees. The gnarled trunk, carefully shaded to give a sense of its
age, and its white blossoms are smack up against the viewer's eye;
seen through them are a warm rosy sky and a gray-green lawn. So
intrigued was van Gogh by this innovative composition that in 1887
he reinterpreted it on canvas.
</P>
<P>
   Summer, manifested in evening outings in pleasure boats, urban
festivals, more floral extravaganzas and the rainy season, is the
subject of another 30 prints. There is a wonderful rendition of
blossoming irises in a suburban garden in which Hiroshige uses the
same close-up perspective device as in the dragon plum print. It
includes, too, a scene considered the masterpiece of the entire
series, ``Sudden Shower Over Shin-Ohashi Bridge and Atake,'' in
which long, slanting lines of rain from heavy clouds descend on a
handful of figures crossing a wooden bridge. The lowering clouds,
the people assaulted by the torrent, and the fuzzy outlines of
mist-veiled trees on the shore convey an isolation and helplessness
in the face of impulsive, imperious Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Autumn brought excursions to scenic attractions, harvest
festivals, the harvest moon and leaf-looking, just as in today's
New England. Twenty-six of the prints are devoted to the season,
among them such striking examples as ``Moon-Viewing Point,'' a
tranquil rendering of a full moon, calm water and the room in a
brothel from which they are seen; ``Naito Shinjuku, Yotsuya,'' a
view of a rowdy highway town inflected by the giant hind quarters
of horses and their droppings; and ``Fireworks at Ryogoku,'' an
explosive burst that lights up the night sky over the Ryogoku
Bridge with its attendant pleasure boats.
</P>
<P>
   Winter, a time for snow-gazing and the spotting of cranes, is
celebrated in images like ``Minowa, Kanasugi, Mikawashima,'' a
distant view of three villages in an area where cranes were
protected. A huge, stylized bird swoops down from the sky toward a
more realistic one standing on the shore beneath.
</P>
<P>
   There are striking snow scenes like ``Kinryuzan Temple,
Asakusa,'' where, at the entrance to the city's oldest Buddhist
shrine, snow falls from a gray sky to sketch trees and temple
buildings, with the scene dominated by an outsize lantern in red
and black that swings from the top of the temple gate like a
celestial body.
</P>
<P>
   And there are witty, offbeat treatments like ``Asakusa Rice
Fields and Torinomachi Festival,'' whose skewed perspective reveals
a distant view of a temple celebration watched by a cat in a
brothel window right under the viewer's nose.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he produced ``100 Famous Views of Edo,'' the most
ambitious landscape series in the ukiyo-e genre, Hiroshige was long
famous for his success in the medium. Earlier, he had published
hits like ``36 Views of Mount Fuji'' (early 1830's) and ``53
Stations of the Tokaido'' (1833-34), a pictorial account of events
on the highway from Tokyo to Kyoto.
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in Edo, the son of a low-ranking member of the
elite samurai class who served the shogun as a fire-protection
official, Hiroshige began to study printmaking as a teen-ager after
the death of his father. He inherited his father's job but
nonetheless managed to work with a master printmaker for 17 years.
He learned to enrich the basic woodblock image with such techniques
as gradation, or bokashi, a process of carefully wiping color off
the block before printing, and creating texture by pressing fabric
into the paper.
</P>
<P>
   He came into his own after the death of his master in 1828, when
he turned to landscape. With wit, a flair for innovative
composition, sudden shifts in perspective and skilled coloring he
turned out arresting views with lyrical overtones, and became
immensely, even glibly, productive. Approaching old age, he shaved
his head and renounced the world to become a Buddhist priest, which
may have helped him focus his efforts. Whether or not the results
gratified the artist, they richly reward the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hiroshige: One Hundred Famous Views of Edo'' is at the
Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park,
(718) 638-5000, through April 23.

   IRAN-ELECT (Tehran, Iran) _ Clutching palm cards from their
favorite political parties and crumpled hand-drawn lists of
candidates, Iranians streamed to the polls Friday in numbers large
enough to force officials to extend the voting time by two hours.
People were still waiting in line to vote outside of mosques and
schools in Tehran at 9 p.m., when the voting for the Parliament
officially ended. The apparently big turnout heartened the
reformers who hoped to ride into power on a wave of popular
discontent with the conservative clergymen who have dominated the
country for 21 years. By Susan Sachs.

<P>
   MEXICO-OIL (Veracruz, Mexico) _ For two years, Mexico has worked
with other oil rich nations to pump up petroleum prices. But now
that those efforts have borne fruit, senior officials in recent
days have done an about face and are trying to talk the world price
back down because of Mexico's dependence on the United States'
economy. This performance has put President Ernesto Zedillo's
government in a ticklish predicament. Leaders of the industrialized
world are glaring at Mexico, complaining that petroleum prices are
fueling inflation. And the Mexican left is accusing the government
of giving up an oil bonanza by capitulating to the imperialists. By

   CUBAN-SPY (Miami) _ A high-ranking U.S. immigration official was
charged with spying for the Cuban government on Friday, having been
caught in what federal officials described as an elaborate sting
operation as he was telling a Cuban intelligence agent about a
Cuban citizens' plan to defect to the United States. In a case with
no known precedent in the long and hostile relationship of the
United States and the 41-year-old Castro government, Mariano Faget,
54, who was born in Havana, was arrested by the FBI late Thursday
and charged with violations of the Espionage Act and of lying to
federal agents. By Peter T. Kilborn.

   ILL-GOVERNOR (Springfield, Ill.) _ Sitting in a chair facing a
bronze statue of Abraham Lincoln in the Illinois capitol, Gov.
George Ryan shuddered as he recalled ``the most anguishing period
of my life.'' Ryan had been deciding whether to grant a stay of
execution last year for a man convicted of a brutal slaying and
mutilation. In the end, Ryan, a supporter of the death penalty,
denied the stay, and hoped he would never be faced with such a
decision again. But a little over a month ago, the state attorney
general, Jim Ryan, called the governor to tell him that another
execution would soon be scheduled in Illinois, a state that has
seen 13 men wrongfully convicted and sent to death row. ``I can't
do it,'' the governor told him. ``I'm going to put a stop to this.
The system is broken. It's time we take a look and see what's
wrong.'' A few days later, Gov. Ryan declared a halt to executions
in Illinois, the first to impose such a moratorium. A profile by
Dirk Johnson.

   REPUBS-SC (Columbia, S.C.) _ Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John
McCain stopped courting supporters Friday and instead turned their
full attention to rousing them to the polls here in the final hours
of a race that both sides said appears so competitive that every
last effort to get out the vote could make a difference. The
contest here has stirred such intense interest that strategists on
both sides predicted that turnout would far exceed the 277,000 who

message of unity not division, all qualities that the party
desperately needed to regain the White House. But in the 17 days
since he lost the New Hampshire primary, Bush has become a

that his father used when his back was against the wall. A news

<P>
   You can't call them the ``Granny Awards'' anymore.
</P>
<P>
   After struggling for years to counter a stodgy, out-of-touch
image, the Grammy Awards are as up-to-date as the spring fashions
at your local Gap store.
</P>
<P>
   While veteran rocker Carlos Santana is expected to sweep this
year's awards (he has received 10 nominations), a new generation of
recording acts _ among them Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and
the Backstreet Boys _ could steal the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   The top three Grammy categories _ record of the year, album of
the year and song of the year _ are jammed with the young stars
currently topping the record charts.
</P>
<P>
   For record of the year, veterans Santana and Cher are up against
TLC, the Backstreet Boys and former Menudo member Ricky Martin, who
wowed last year's Grammy audiences with an explosive performance
that launched his career and boosted interest in Latin pop.
</P>
<P>
   In the album-of-the-year category, Santana faces competition
from jazz star Diana Krall, as well as the Backstreet Boys, TLC and
country phenoms the Dixie Chicks, who turned Nashville on its ear
in 1999 and went to No. 1 on The Billboard 200 album chart with
``Fly.''
</P>
<P>
   And though it is a songwriters award and not an artists award,
the song-of-the-year category includes tunes that became hits for
the Backstreet Boys, Ricky Martin and TLC, as well as Santana and
Shania Twain.
</P>
<P>
   Another big category to watch: best new artist. Will Britney
Spears be the slam-dunk winner? Or will upstart Christina Aguilera
steal the show? (Both are former cast members of ``The New Mickey
Mouse Club.'') And one can't dismiss Kid Rock, who represents the
popular new rap-rock trend.
</P>
<P>
   Adding more interest to the best new artist category are
nominees Macy Gray, the R&AMP;B singer whose star is on the rise; and
singer-guitarist Susan Tedeschi, a dark-horse favorite of
blues-rock fans who have seen her stunning live shows.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of who dominates the 42nd annual Grammy Awards _
seasoned veterans or fresh-faced newcomers _ the telecast Wednesday
promises to be interesting.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour ceremony takes place at Los Angeles' new Staples
Center, a larger, more streamlined facility than the old Shrine
Auditorium where the Grammys have been held in the past. Capacity
is now 12,000 _ vs. 5,000 at the Shrine _ allowing for a much
larger audience of performers and voting members of the National
Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The modern, award-show-friendly Staples Center will allow camera
crews, presenters and award winners more freedom of movement. And
three stages instead of one should result in a more efficient
telecast, one that is free of the embarrassing glitches of the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Rosie O'Donnell, star of her own successful talk show, is once
again host. O'Donnell proved herself last year by demonstrating her
knowledge of the nominees and their music, as well as her
understanding of current trends. Her devilish sense of humor
delighted viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony boasts an impressive slate of performers. Ricky
Martin returns, joining jazz greats Chuco Valdes and Poncho Sanchez
and Cuba's Ibrahim Ferrer (of ``Buena Vista Social Club'' fame) for
a Latin all-star performance.
</P>
<P>
   Their appearance will herald the addition of two more Latin
categories (for a total of seven) and serve as a preview for the
first Latin Grammys ceremony Sept. 15 in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Other performers will include Santana, TLC, the Dixie Chicks,
Faith Hill, Whitney Houston, Kid Rock, Britney Spears, Marc
Anthony, and Sting and his collaborator, world-music star Cheb Mami
(the two will perform their new single, ``Desert Rose,'' from
Sting's ``Brand New Day'' album). In addition, Billy Joel will be
the host of an all-star tribute to Elton John, who will receive a
Grammy Legend Award.
</P>
<P>
   Presenters will include 'N Sync, Busta Rhymes, Phil Collins,
Macy Gray, Christina Aguilera, Gloria Estefan, Vince Gill, Jennifer
Lopez and Ray Romano.
</P>
<P>
   One can only hope that O'Donnell and her cast of performers and
presenters will enliven a ceremony that is much too long and often
bogs down during the seventh-inning stretch.
</P>
<P>
   If the Grammys look hipper this year, much of the credit should
go to Michael Greene, president and chief executive officer of the
National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, which produces the
annual awards and whose members choose the nominees and vote on the
winners.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, Greene has boosted membership in the
organization by more than 3,000 to 15,000, resulting in nominees
that better reflect what is going on in today's popular music.
</P>
<P>
   But there is still progress to be made in recognizing
lower-profile, but no less influential, independent artists.

 &HT;    KENYAN PRESIDENT PLEADS FOR PEACE, DESPITE PROTESTS
 &HT;    (400&AMP;ADD).
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY JR.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Several participants shouted, while others walked
out of a luncheon in protest as Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
spoke to the National Summit on Africa Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Moi's pleas for unity and peace, the protesters yelled
``the people of Kenya need freedom,'' and ``Moi abandoned the
people of Kenya.'' They were escorted out of the luncheon
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   The 74-year-old African leader has squelched opposition and free
press in Kenya. In addition, the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund to freeze funding in 1997, citing corruption and lack
of accountability in the government.
</P>
<P>
   However, on Friday, Moi urged the United States and other
Western nations to help breathe life back into Africa, saying that
the continent has been marginalized since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Moi said as ``Africa ceased to exist'' in the eyes of the world,
far too many of the continent's 54 nations have become mired in
poverty and famine, and been decimated by the AIDS epidemic _ which
has killed millions of Africans. Moreover, he called for the
resolution of the fighting that is rampant in African countries,
such as the Congo, that has forced children to join in the
slaughtering of innocent people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not stand by and watch children carry guns,'' he said.
``We welcome all efforts of the United Nations and the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the primary goal of the five-day summit _ which
President Clinton addressed Thursday _ is to boost American
interest and investment in Africa. The more than 23,000 delegates
from all 50 states and various African nations are expected to
draft and adopt a national policy plan to help guide business and
government policymakers in their relations with Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Moi also cautioned the African leaders attending the
luncheon that while outside help is welcomed, that they must take
the first steps in solving their own problems by laying down their
arms and promoting democracy throughout the continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the conflicts are not resolved, development will be held
back,'' Moi said. ``A peaceful Africa is better for everyone''
</P>
<P>
   Moi also pointed a finger at Western media for focusing on the
continent's war and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The media's) messages make it difficult for people to come to
our countries and invest, and it causes confusion among
(Africans),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Also speaking at the summit luncheon via telephone was Vice
President Al Gore. The democratic presidential frontrunner said he
decided not to attend to avoid having to cross a labor picket line
at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Like Moi and many other speakers, however, Gore urged for more
trade with Africa and commended the Clinton administration for its
efforts to help Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``This rising commitment to the continent of Africa comes at the
right time, because we are entering a new century with new security
challenges that all mankind must face together,'' said Gore, who,
at last month's U.N. Security Council meeting, asked for a $100
million increase to fight AIDS in Africa,

   The Conestoga wagon. Clipper ship. Ironclad. Transcontinental
passenger train. Ocean liner. Flying boat. Notice a trend here?
</P>
<P>
   All those mainstays of mass transportation _ each of them bold
technological advances in their day _ were in turn displaced by
subsequent inventions. Now comes the Internet, and we are all: sick
of hearing about it, stunned by the ease and speed of it, fearful
of the implications of it, and eager to learn more about what it
can do to or for us as individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Everything will be different, Web-heads assure us. Sure. Maybe.
There's probably at least some truth in that. Media are certainly
changing. The old television networks _ like the Life, Look, and
Colliers of the glossy photo giant magazine era _ seem to be
decomposing in the face of competition for eyeballs.
</P>
<P>
   And the mass circulation newspapers are on a grim diet of
shrinking readership, elbowing their way self-consciously into the
Webbed world. Consumers can click their way to specificity in ways
unimaginable five years ago, and it gets harder and harder to amass
eyeballs in sufficient numbers to impress advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the communications business _ information, news,
entertainment, data, archives _ is roiled by innovations comparable
to the displacement of steam, horsemeat, and rickshaws by a newer
``new thing,'' so are the craft of politics and the practice of
government due for a bone-cracking shakeup. And shakeout.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen months ago I wrote a column about how the
invisible-but-not-yet-invincible Internet gained a toehold in the
political game in the just-concluded off-year election cycle. Use
of the Web helped reelect one US senator (Harry Reid of Nevada,
winner by 400-odd votes after 10,000 hits on his Web site). It was
a huge tool in the kit of a professional wrestler without a college
degree, who ran under the old media's radar screen and became
Governor Jesse Ventura of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   It helped dampen the impeachment drive by recruiting hundreds of
thousands of real voters with real names and e-mail addresses to
MoveOn.org, a massive chain letter demanding that Congress stop
trying to impeach Clinton. Still, the World Wide Web did not
displace television, both the free and paid varieties, as the
dominant means of political communication.
</P>
<P>
   How goes it so far this season? Things are moving. Every
presidential candidate has a Web presence. From the day four years
ago when Bob Dole croaked out his Web address with a glum smile
acknowledging the passing of an era (his), you could no longer run
without an interactive site to play with and off.
</P>
<P>
   The Web creates ``ad-hocracies''; it assembles ``cheap
eyeballs'' like nobody's business, as long as you have something
that drives them, or pulls them, to your portal. This cycle, the
magnetism, is most evident at www.mccain2000.com where the hottest
draw on the campaign trail is also packing them in.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning the day after he dope-slapped Texas Governor George W.
Bush by clocking him over the noggin in New Hampshire with an
18-percent victory, McCain discovered his Web site had morphed into
a volcano of contributions, spewing forth credit-card cash at a
rate exceeding $20,000 per hour, 'round the clock.
</P>
<P>
   The way in which McCain took his crusade to clean up politics
national in the days after New Hampshire could not have been
managed in such a compressed time frame without the Internet. The
Web enabled a candidate like McCain to take advantage of the
economies of scalability. That is, I'm told by experts, the way in
which it is possible to expand a range of contacts from, say, 10 to
1,000 or 10,000, or umpty-nine million, with merely a few handy
manipulations of the machinery.
</P>
<P>
   So after spending over 60 days in New Hampshire, conducting 114
town meetings, and riding thousands of miles up and down Interstate
93 in search of flinty New Hampshire voters, McCain was able to
take his pitch from retail to wholesale in a remarkably short time.
His hit-counter at headquarters in Alexandria, Va., sounds like a
Geiger counter dropped down the shaft of a uranium mine. That baby
is cooking.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's exponential expansion via the Web, which enabled him to
create almost overnight a national organization with far less
expenditure of cash and time than the Bush machine, is perhaps the
fastest setup on record, save that of the MoveOn.org crowd.
Assuming millions of Americans wanted to say ``Enough, already!''
to Kenneth Starr and the GOP impeachment crew, MoveOn signed up
3,000 supporters on line in its first day of operation, 10,000 the
second day, to 300,000 strong, identifiable supporters in more than
200 congressional districts _ all in just days.
</P>
<P>
   You can do a lot with a little in the Web world. Roy Barnes got
elected governor in Georgia with some Web help. His son, Harlan,
stitched together a skeleton crew of just six full-time political
workers to win the Democratic primary. By the time Barnes Sr. was
elected governor, there were only 20 full-time paid staff,
remarkably few for a state that size, and made possible only by the
communications wizardry of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Bush is spending $3 million a week to rejigger
his campaign after the New Hampshire shocker. Bush Junior is
burning through a huge load of cash, and his contributors are
wondering where all the dough went.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Alaska's GOP allowed Internet voting for remote
Republicans; only 35 clicked in from across the tundra, but there
is a court fight underway in Arizona to block plans for Democrats
there to vote on line. California has nixed the idea for now, but
the Pentagon will allow military personnel to vote in November at
250 virus-free military base computer stations. New York State,
which has a long tradition of denying voting status to any but the
most regular of regulars, is also refusing to move to consider
Internet voting.
</P>
<P>
   But it is only a matter of time. There are 6 million Americans
overseas on any given day, and the easiest way for them to weigh in
on Election Day is via the Web. ``Some form of this is going to be
something we see at some time in our lives,'' predicts Bruce
Sherbert, elections administrator for Dallas County, Texas. He's
undoubtedly right.

 &HT;    A SWEET FINDING ON HEALTH BENEFITS OF CHOCOLATE
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Good news: Chocolate's good for you.
</P>
<P>
   Within two hours of eating ``M&AMP;Ms'' Semi-Sweet Chocolate Mini
Baking Bits or drinking an eight-ounce glass of cocoa, dedicated
volunteers were blessed with decreased activation of platelets,
which are linked to heart attacks and stroke, and with an increased
ability to neutralize harmful free radicals, said researchers from
the University of California, Davis.
</P>
<P>
   So help yourself to another bite of that Hershey bar. But
remember, like a lot of good news from Washington, there may be a
catch.
</P>
<P>
   An American Heart Association spokesman pointed out that no one
has produced scientific evidence that eating chocolate reduces the
risk of heart disease. And the study groups were small, usually
fewer than 15 volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of any epidemiological data that indicates
chocolate improves health,'' said Robert H. Eckel, a professor of
medicine at the University of Colorado and chairman of the American
Heart Association Nutrition Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would also tend to be concerned about applying data to 10 or
15 subjects given chocolate to the world in general,'' Eckel added.
</P>
<P>
   The research was funded by candy company, the Mars Inc., the
company that makes M&AMP;Ms and other candies. It will be presented
Saturday at the annual meeting of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science. Keen and several of his colleagues
previewed their presentation Friday at a standing-room-only press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``These findings are very promising and suggest that, with
balance and moderation, chocolate can contribute to a healthy
diet,'' said Carl Keen, professor of nutrition at the University of
California, Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Keen and other chocolate researchers speculated that plant
chemicals calls flavonoids are behind the perceived benefit of
chocolate. Suggestions that the chemicals can ward off cancer,
coronary heart disease and other afflictions have intrigued
nutritionists for years. Similar flavonoids are found in red wine,
tea, soybeans and many other foods.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to evidence that cocoa flavonoids may remove free
radicals and interrupt the processes leading to platelet
aggregation _ or blood clotting _ University of California, Davis,
researcher C. Tissa Kappagoda described research that indicates the
substances increase the presence of nitric oxide and cause blood
vessels to relax.
</P>
<P>
   Besides flavonoids, chocolate is rich in saturated fats, which
generally have the opposite effects of those cited in the
California studies.
</P>
<P>
   The press briefing was also attended by Harold Schmitz, group
research manager at Mars Inc. He refused to disclosed how much
money the company had spent to support the research or to say
whether it would seek federal Food and Drug Administration
permission to include a health claim on its labels.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is at the preliminary stage and an awful lot of research
needs to be done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schmitz said no one knows why plants have flavonoids, but the
reason may be that ``they are pretty good pesticides.'' Chocolate
is taken from a plant that originated in equatorial areas, he said,
and the plant may have a ``uniquely large'' concentration of
flavonoids because of greater insect predation.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he said, the plant produces a bean that would not sprout
if an animal came along and ate it as soon as it fell to the
ground. Chocolate flavonoids are unusually bitter and may have
evolved to make the beans unpalatable.

YOU WERE GOOD MEN, CHARLES SCHULZ AND TOM LANDRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two of my heroes, Tom Landry, the former Dallas Cowboys coach,
and Charles Schulz, creator of the comic strip Peanuts, left us in
the past week.
</P>
<P>
   The two men were so different and yet so similar. Through
integrity and genius they touched millions of people.
</P>
<P>
   Although I never met Schulz, I felt I knew him because he had
brightened so many of my mornings with Charlie Brown, Lucy, Linus,
Snoopy and the other lovable figures in Peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   Who hasn't identified with the innocent-looking, round-headed
Charlie Brown, always trying to do the right thing and never quite
making it. I looked forward to football season each year to see
whether Lucy would again pull away the football just as Charlie
Brown was about to kick it. She always did.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball season was always enlivened by Charlie Brown's
efforts to win with a dismal team, including Lucy in right field.
He was always optimistic. Despite his failures, he kept on going.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz's comic strips and other works have been interpreted as
Christian teachings in ``The Gospel According to Peanuts'' by
Robert Short. Short says the characters teach such qualities as
loving one's neighbor and forgiveness. In the television classic
``A Charlie Brown Christmas,'' the Christmas story is read from the
book of Matthew.
</P>
<P>
   It was like Schulz to send us a personal message about the end
of the Peanuts strip. As things turned out, the message came out
the morning after he died.
</P>
<P>
   Mornings won't be the same.
</P>
<P>
   We will also miss Tom Landry.
</P>
<P>
   It was good to know that a man like Landry was still around.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had coached teams to five Super Bowls, winning two
of them, he did not see that as his greatest accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   What he valued most was the opportunity his coaching success
gave him to speak to young people _ and older ones, too _ about his
strong faith.
</P>
<P>
   Landry was not a deeply committed believer until early in his
coaching career. He had attended church in his hometown of Mission
in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas but took his faith for granted.
Then someone in Dallas invited him to a weekly Bible study.
</P>
<P>
   That changed his life.
</P>
<P>
   Landry did not see himself as a saint. But he believed
commitment to strong principles of faith and morals was the secret
to transforming individuals, families, the nation and the world.
</P>
<P>
   Even when he was coach of the Cowboys and locked into efforts to
win Super Bowls, Landry would talk to any reporter who wanted to
discuss his Christian faith.
</P>
<P>
   I called the Dallas Cowboys main office several years ago and
told the receptionist I was a religion reporter who wanted to
interview Landry.
</P>
<P>
   The next voice I heard said: ``Hello, this is Tom Landry.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was fired as Dallas Cowboys coach, I was one of many who
wrote letters to Landry expressing my dissatisfaction with how the
dismissal was handled and my appreciation of his coaching career.
</P>
<P>
   I never expected acknowledgment of the letter.
</P>
<P>
   But several days later I received a reply, signed by Landry,
thanking me for my support of the Cowboys during his coaching years
and urging me to continue to support the team in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   That was Landry. A man of class.
</P>
<P>
   Although his coaching career had ended, he stayed busy doing
commercials and making public appearances for many charitable
causes. He spoke at several Billy Graham crusades.
</P>
<P>
   I last interviewed Landry in 1994 shortly after he had been
inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Fort Worth city
officials had declared ``Tom Landry Day,'' and he was to be honored
at the annual banquet of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, his
favorite organization.
</P>
<P>
   Without his hat, the 6-foot-2 Landry was not the unemotional,
formidable presence he appeared to be on the sidelines. He was
engaging and smiling. He told me how much his faith meant to him
during the high and low points of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Two of America's heroes _ Charles Schulz and Tom Landry _
quietly left an indelible impression on our hearts.

OLIVIER AWARDS HONOR PETER O'TOOLE, `LION KING'  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The actor Peter O'Toole was honored for his longstanding
contribution to the British stage with the Outstanding Achievement
citation at the 24th annual Laurence Olivier Awards on Thursday in
London.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting the award from the actress Joan Plowright, Lord
Olivier's widow, O'Toole acknowledged that his friendship with
Olivier had at times been turbulent and noted that ``Good parts
make good actors.''
</P>
<P>
   For best new musical, ``The Lion King,'' although hailed by the
London critics, failed to recreate its Tony Award-winning sweep and
lost to the Royal National Theater production of ``Honk! The Ugly
Duckling,'' based on the Hans Christian Andersen story. ``The Lion
King'' did come away with awards for best costume designer for
Julie Taymor, who also directed the show, and for best theater
choreographer for Garth Fagan.
</P>
<P>
   The National was this year's big winner with nine awards,
including best actor for Henry Goodman in ``Merchant of Venice''
and outstanding musical production for ``Candide,'' whose lead,
Simon Russell Beale, was given the award for best actor in a
musical. Trevor Nunn, the theater's artistic director, won as best
director for his productions of ``Summerfolk,'' ``The Merchant of
Venice'' and ``Troilus and Cressida.''
</P>
<P>
   The American playwright Richard Nelson won for best new play for
``Goodnight Children Everywhere'' at the Royal Shakespeare Co.
Nelson thanked the company for support ``unheard of for a
foreigner'' for presenting nine of his works, eight of which were
commissioned.
</P>
<P>
   The awards, presented by the Society of London, were sponsored
for the first time this year by Radisson Edwardian Hotels.

LETTERMAN'S RETURN WILL GOOSE RATINGS, BUT RISE WON'T LAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a four-week absence, David Letterman returns to his ``Late
Show'' perch Monday more popular than when he left. How he achieved
this, first from a hospital bed and later while kicking back at an
island retreat in the Caribbean, is a testament to the oddity of
celebrity, and how, perhaps, absence can make the ratings grow
fonder when you make the right kind of marketing moves.
</P>
<P>
   Expect Letterman's numbers to skyrocket this week. Not to ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' levels. But he'll attract enough of the
curious to regain the ratings footing he'd amassed with the Hillary
Clinton interview shortly before that emergency quintuple bypass
surgery forced show producers to come up with emergency measures of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with the help of guest hosts (Bill Cosby on Tuesday, Regis
Philbin two days after that, others to follow as Letterman eases
into a full work schedule) the numbers will level out. And ``The
Late Show'' will end up right where it's been the past several
seasons: behind Jay Leno's ``Tonight Show'' on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Letterman's inability to best Leno without gimmicks and special
shows (even the past two weeks of special ``Backstage'' shows with
guests recalling Letterman interviews) continues to be frustrating
for CBS, which feels it has the more creative and energetic show.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when ``The People's Choice Awards'' names Jennifer
Love Hewitt as best actress in a drama and nominates UPN's ``Shasta
McNasty'' as a best-comedy contender, it's no shock when popularity
and quality fail to intersect.
</P>
<P>
   Leno has won by foraying into middle America, a group unwilling
to turn away from him no matter how predictable and safe he gets;
these are people who will grow old and die with him, like longtime
spouses who don't love one another but don't hate each other enough
to leave, either. It's called being comfortable, and it's
particularly common among ``Tonight Show'' devotees, including the
band of Johnny Carson holdovers who view leaving ``The Tonight
Show'' as leaving Carson. (Which is odd, considering that Carson
left them.)
</P>
<P>
   When I watched ``The Tonight Show'' the other night, it was
obvious that Leno is on autopilot, treating almost all of his
guests like stand-up comedians in need of setups for their punch
lines. Watch closely and you'll notice there's always a portion of
the interview segment when the guest gingerly moves into a story,
one that was picked by producers in the pre-interview as the one to
tell. ``Oh, and that reminds me ...''
</P>
<P>
   Leno knows this, the star knows this, and, by now, the audience
should know this. So it often comes across as rehearsed and dry.
Michelle Williams of ``Dawson's Creek'' looked terrified after
telling her story (for the life of me I can't remember what it was,
which goes to show you how interesting it was to begin with)
because there was little audience response, and the look on Leno's
face was: You Didn't Tell It Right.
</P>
<P>
   Guests on ``The Late Show'' are booked on that show to push
their movie/TV show/CD/book, too, just as they are on Craig
Kilborn's insufferable ``Late, Late Show'' on CBS and Jon Stewart's
smart-aleck installments on Comedy Central's ``The Daily Show.''
(''Politically Incorrect'' relies on the odd mix of its guests, but
it's the better buy.)
</P>
<P>
   But at least guests have an emotional response to Letterman's
interviewing _ whether it's intimidation (Calista Flockhart a few
months back turned apple-red at the first question) or eagerness
for a rough-and-tumble time, which is what fuels the legend of
guests like Drew Barrymore.
</P>
<P>
   At least that response is not so darn calculated, like the way
Leno ``energizes'' the audience by dashing out at the show's outset
slapping high-fives with audience members seated in front of the
stage just for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the ``Backstage'' episodes did for Letterman fans was
give them a sense of the hilarity that can come out of what on the
surface looked ho-hum, like when Letterman stopped the amazingly
stiff Matthew Broderick in midsentence to ask about his fly being
open. (Even funnier was wife Sarah Jessica Parker spilling the
beans about her hubby's reaction after he got home.) Or Letterman
telling another star, ``You don't believe all that crap, do you?''
</P>
<P>
   Or Letterman's ongoing flirtation with women _ something that
would make Leno's head explode from embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you just about to come out of that dress?'' Letterman
asked Barrymore, who was about to come out of a blue number that
was literally hanging for dear life from her shoulders. (Another
goodie from ``Backstage'' was the replay of the Barrymore
breast-flashing dance on Letterman's table.)
</P>
<P>
   Paul Shaffer to Barrymore during their ``Backstage'' segment:
``You are definitely one of Dave's favorite girls. We know you'll
be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course. And Letterman will be ready.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the tube this week:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wishing Tree'' (7 p.m. CST Sunday, Showtime) Alfre Woodard
stars as a hard-driving attorney whose professional life
overshadows her personal side. She learns, through the course of
this effective film, to grow and change with the help of friends.
Check out Blair Underwood in that stranded-on-a-desert-island
beard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flowers for Algernon'' (8 p.m. CST Sunday, CBS) Since few
actors play Forrest Gumpish sincerity better than Matthew Modine,
and even fewer flash smiles as bright as Kelli Williams (''The
Practice'') this quiet little film works in a lot of ways. The
subject isn't bad, either. A scientific experiment turns a mentally
challenged man (Modine) into a genius, forcing him to learn how to
survive in ``a harsh'' world. It's based on the same book that was
the source for the 1968 movie ``Charly.'' (Hey, just tape ``The
Practice'' for a double dose of Williams.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Richard'' (8 p.m. CST Sunday, NBC) Leon, last seen as
David Ruffin in the miniseries ``The Temptations,'' stars as rock
'n' roll pioneer Little Richard. Great soundtrack of original
recordings, but this by-the-dots bio movie would have been better
had it brought us up to date on Little Richard's life today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dharma &AMP; Greg'' (8 p.m. CST Tuesday, ABC) Greg (Thomas Gibson)
is embarrassed by an injury he suffers during an ``adventurous
escapade'' with the ever-adventurous Dharma (Jenna Elfman). Wonder
what that would be. Tom Poston guest-stars as the doctor he turns
to. This series has been creatively low-key this season. What's up
with that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Dilbert'' (8:30 p.m. CST Tuesday, UPN) Jerry Seinfeld is the
guest voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love Chronicles: May-December Love'' (9 p.m. CST Tuesday, A&AMP;E)
Terrific documentary exploring the ``biological, psychological and
sociological aspects'' of love pairings between older and younger
folk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stark Raving Mad'' (8:30 p.m. CST Thursday, NBC) Horror film
director Wes Craven guest-stars as a favorite author whom Ian (Tony
Shalhoub) wants to impress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love and Action in Chicago'' (7 p.m. CST Friday, Cinemax) Is
Courtney B. Vance becoming the new action star? On cable, he is.
Here he plays a government assassin eying retirement after his new
girlfriend (Regina King) objects to his line of work. Of course,
his bosses have other ideas. That Jason Alexander and Kathleen
Turner are involved suggest that this is a comedic thriller. (It
is, and not a bad one at that.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Real Sex 24'' (10:30 p.m. CST Saturday, HBO) The latest
installment of this often bizarre but incredibly popular series.
(That it's on No. 24 should give you a clue.) This one includes a
filmmaker who specializes in pornography for foot fetishists. Hmmm.

BEIRUT PROTESTERS MARCH ON CNN AND U.N. OFFICES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ A second day of angry street protests against
Israel and the United States turned against the U.S. cable network
CNN Friday, with Lebanese soldiers and policemen in riot gear
firing tear gas to drive back about 3,000 demonstrators who tried
to reach CNN's Beirut offices.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators, mostly university students, dispersed after
about an hour without breaking through barricades. Their anger at
CNN, the only U.S. television network with a news bureau in the
Lebanese capital, appeared to be as much an outgrowth of a
widespread resentment of U.S. support for Israel as an attack on
CNN's Middle East coverage, although that, too, was widely
condemned.
</P>
<P>
   After protesters outside the U.S. Embassy were turned back by
tear-gas volleys and powerful water cannons Thursday, popular fury
against the United States was left, in effect, looking for a more
accessible target. The embassy protest, involving a crowd that some
Lebanese accounts estimated at 2,000, was halted several hundred
yards from the perimeter wall of the new embassy compound.
</P>
<P>
   The protests stemmed from Israeli bombing raids on Feb. 8 that
destroyed three Lebanese power plants, wounded about 20 Lebanese
civilians and cut the country's electricity by 50 percent. The
attacks left the Lebanese government, still struggling to rebuild
the country in the aftermath of a 16-year civil war that ended in
1989, with a reconstruction bill that has been estimated at $50
million. Israel described the raids as retaliation for attacks by
guerrilla fighters of Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Islamic militant
group that has killed seven Israeli soldiers since last month.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's demonstrations began as about 5,000 people marched on
the U.N. headquarters in a redeveloped part of West Beirut. The
march passed off peacefully after being halted at barricades
guarded by Lebanese soldiers and the police. Some protesters waved
the yellow banners of Hezbollah and the green banners of Amal, a
rival Shiite Muslim faction, and shouted slogans against the United
States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Others carried versions of the Star of David that had been
disfigured with Nazi swastikas.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, some of the same demonstrators showed up about
a mile away at the protest against CNN. This time, there was no
visible sign of involvement by Hezbollah or Amal, and most
protesters appeared to come from two universities in the Lebanese
capital with strong U.S. links, the American University of Beirut
and the Lebanese American University. Both colleges enroll mainly
Lebanese students, but maintain offices in New York that raise
money for the operations here.
</P>
<P>
   After the initial tear-gas volleys, the marchers held back from
the barricades, singing the Lebanese national anthem and burning a
U.S. flag. Many of their hand-lettered protest signs criticized
U.S. policy toward Lebanon, in particular Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's initial response to the power plant bombings,
which was seen here as an endorsement of the Israeli action.
``Albright, Lebanon all dark,'' said one.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a bid to stem the buildup of anti-U.S. sentiment, the U.S.
ambassador, David Satterfield, passed a letter on Wednesday to the
Lebanese prime minister, Selim al-Hoss, in which Albright appeared
to shift her position on the power plant bombings. Satterfield,
summarizing the letter, said Albright ``expressed her deep sorrow
and regret on behalf of the United States government over the
attacks which have taken place on the civilian infrastructure of
Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   But the letter came too late to stanch the street protests,
which were spurred on when Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah
leader, called in a speech on Tuesday for the Lebanese to show
their anger at the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At the protest outside the CNN offices, there were shouts of
``Zionist journalists,'' but few of the demonstrators appeared to
have specific complaints against CNN's coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Several demonstrators acknowledged that they were unaware that
CNN had shown extensive filmed reports of the power plant attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Nazib el-Emad, a 21-year-old law student at Lebanese American
University, described CNN's general Middle East coverage as
``propaganda,'' but he, too, admitted that he had not seen the
network's coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of oppression on us _ the lies, the
international media, Israel,'' he said.

   POLITICS-CHANGING-REVIEW (Undated) _ As candidates cling to
long-held positions or candidly change them, a debate develops
about why politicians and their handlers consider consistency so
important when candidates do, just like other people, change their

   HACKERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Computers are under constant random

apparently were launched by doorknob rattlers. Users who connect to
the Internet at home, using telephone lines, are of little interest
to the intruders. But people who use cable connections or DSL lines
are a different story. So are companies and universities that hook
everyone up with cable modems. By Gina Kolata.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-SECURITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Combating cybercrimes such
as the recent attacks on major Web sites seems to be among the
easier Internet issues to handle. It will require some new tools,
new skills and new forms of cooperation among government agencies.
But the issue appears to be mainly one of enforcement, not
requiring new laws or new policy. The more thorny policy issues

   ECON-WAGES-REVIEW (Undated) _ America's nine-year economic
expansion is the longest in history. So wages should be climbing

raise pay to lure new workers or to retain the ones they have. But
wage increases, instead of getting bigger, are getting smaller.

<P>
   MILLIONAIRE-PROSTITUTION-REVIEW (Undated) _ Was ``Who Wants to
Marry a Multimillionaire?'' a form of prostitution? Although no one

   KOSOVO-REVIEW (Prague, Czech Republic) _ In Mitrovica, the
divided town in northern Kosovo where Serbia effectively begins,
long-festering tensions between Serbs to the north and Albanians to
the south have burst into violence. The reasons go deeper than any
tactical mistake made by civilian or military authorities.
Mitrovica marks the effective political and ethnic partition of
Kosovo, and its problems explain why true peace looks so far away,
even eight months after NATO took complete control of the province.

   ITALY-NEWSPAPERS-REVIEW (Rome) _ European countries are more
relaxed about nudity than the United States, particularly in
newspapers and advertising. However, while English and German
newspapers tend to restrict their naked starlets to the

startling graphics into reporting, blurring the line between soft
porn and hard news. A look at some of the ethical issues raised by
Italy's unique style of newspaper advertising and journalism. By

divided town in northern Kosovo where Serbia effectively begins,
long-festering tensions between Serbs to the north and Albanians to
the south have burst into violence. The reasons go deeper than any
tactical mistake made by civilian or military authorities.
Mitrovica marks the effective political and ethnic partition of

AIRPORT (Phoenix) - America West says it has fixed the computer

ALIGN (Undated) - What happens when a conservative congressman and
U.S. senator runs a state out of his hip pocket like the last
right-winger in the West and then decides to run for president as a
leftist progressive? Well, confusion at home, for one thing.
Arizona congressmen support McCain but dislike his new `liberal`
policies. By KRIS MAYES. Story will move in the `A` category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MACEACHERN-COLUMN (Phoenix) - What is it about American voters that
more and more are supporting John McCain? This is a particularly
difficult question for many Arizonans to answer. We know too much
about McCain. Or think we do. We know about his heavy-handed use of
power and about his temper. Oh heavens, do we know about the
temper. We know about the national media and about how far, far
different their cozy view of McCain would be if only they knew the
guy like we do. But the fact is the rest of America does not, and
never will, care about those matters. By DOUG MACEACHERN. Story

   NEW YORK _ Higher interest rates, dead ahead.
</P>
<P>
   That was the uncharacteristically frank message relayed by Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, in his testimony before
Congress last week. What Greenspan could not say is what investors
really want to know: how much higher rates have to go before Fed
policy makers can be sure that economic growth is not inflationary.
</P>
<P>
   Bond traders are betting that there will be three more
one-quarter-point rate increases by July, raising the federal funds
rate to 6.50 percent. It was 4.75 percent last June.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this will be enough to slow the supercharged economy is,
of course, an unknown. But Gemma Wright, interest rate strategist
at Aubrey G. Lanston in New York, sees several key areas of the
economy that must cool before the Fed can relax. ``Housing should
begin to slow; auto purchases and revolving credit need to
decline,'' she said. ``And consumer sentiment should taper off as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock market is an increasingly important part of the mix
that determines Fed actions. Greenspan even detailed how frothy
stock prices have contributed to excess demand for goods, in spite
of rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Because this demand could spawn inflation, it makes Greenspan
worry. Yet since June 30, when the Fed began raising rates, the Dow
Jones industrial average is down only 5.3 percent. And the Nasdaq
composite is up a blistering 69 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market is not yet that scared of the Fed because the
Fed is still in fine-tuning mode,'' said William Dudley, chief
economist at Goldman Sachs. ``They're trying to find a neutral
monetary policy to make growth rates acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   But flouting the Fed, Dudley thinks, will force Greenspan to be
more aggressive on rates than many investors expect. ``Either the
Fed has to raise rates quite a bit, or the stock market has to go
down quite a bit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce economic growth by one percent in a hot stock market,
the Fed would have to raise short and long-term interest rates 1.4
percentage points, he believes. Alternatively, a 20 percent decline
in overall stock prices would produce a one percent decline in
growth, Dudley said, reducing pressure on the Fed to act. He
believes aggressive tightening by the Fed is more likely.
</P>
<P>
   One reason why the economy and the stock market _ or segments of
it _ can roar as rates rise is that the Fed continues to increase
the nation's supply of money. ``The rise in interest rates has been
a reflection of strong economic performance,'' said Mickey Levy,
chief economist at BankAmerica. ``But it's been associated with
strong money growth that is continuing to pump liquidity into the
system, fueling consumption and domestic demand.''
</P>
<P>
   A broad measure of money supply, called zero maturity money, is
growing at an annualized rate of 8.7 percent. Although this is down
from the 14.5 percent growth seen at the end of 1998, it is still
much too rapid if the Fed wants to curb demand, Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing up interest rates while keeping the money spigots wide
open may reflect Greenspan'sversion to playing the role of
stock market spoiler. He wants to protect the nation from the
ravages of inflation, but he also wants investors to party on.
Trouble is, even the mighty Greenspan can't have it both ways.

OUR FASCINATION WITH THE VENTURE INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, February 20, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most of us will never write a business plan, much less sign a
term sheet, celebrate a letter of intent, or, perish the thought,
``go public.''
</P>
<P>
   So why the craze for private equity? The term is more or less
synonymous with ``venture capital'' around the world, though in the
Unites States the term encompasses a significant ``buyout''
industry too, devoted to the restructuring of large and
well-established companies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the first true venture firm, American Research and
Development, was formed only in 1946 _ as a closed-end publicly-
traded fund marketed mainly to individuals. Private partnerships
followed only once the concept was proven.
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't until 1979, when the US Labor Department
interpreted the Employee Retirement Income Security Act as
permitting pension managers to invest broadly in higher-risk
enterprises, that the money really started to pour in.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the venture industry has been on a roller coaster:
down in the late 1980s, but almost entirely up since then. Private
equity funds have grown from $5 billion in 1980 to more than $175
billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the facination has the do with the fact that venture and
buy-out firms are among the foremost architects of the New Economy.
Their principals behave with the verve we have come to expect of
architects everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the interest has to do with the alchemy of personal
wealth, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Quite aside from the relentless hoopla in the business
magazines, three serious books about the start-up industry have
appeared in the last month or so. Each casts light on the process
from its own perspective. (A gripping account of an e-commerce
start-up by a journalist-turned-entrepreneur _ ``The Leap,'' by
Thomas Ashbrook _ is scheduled to appear in May.)
</P>
<P>
   Joseph W. Barlett is a wise lawyer old eough to have worked on
his first fund in 1963 and spent his first night at the printer
overseeing an offering prospectus not long thereafter. A former law
clerk to Chief Justice Earl Warren, former undersecretary of
commerce and a past president of the Boston Bar Association,
Barlett wrote ``Fundamentals of Venture Capital'' as a practical
guide for those starting out to form a company _ or thinking of
investing in one.
</P>
<P>
   The book takes readers through ``the rules, the customs, the
norms, the financial technology, the myths (if you like,) (and) the
conventional wisdom'' of the industry, including a most edifying
discussion (for non-lawyers) of minimizing taxes in the early
stages. He's seen it all and come to the conclusion that the the
cyclical imperative to cash out in timely fashion is a little too
strong for healthy corporate development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to have an unbridgeable chasm separating public
companies from private companies,'' writes Barlett. ``A sensible
regulation would suggest, in my view, that there be comfort
stations along the way, places in which adolescent firms could
reside on their journey from the embryo to the IPO.'' Yet
regulators gripped by tradition aren't even studying the
possibility, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Lerner, too, is interested in the effect of financing
decisions on the life-cycle of particular businesses. A professor
at the Harvard Business school, Lerner is among the nation's
foremost experts on the economics of the industry. ``Venture
Capital and Private Equity: A Casebook'' grew out of a course first
offered at the school in 1993. Its 29 cases take you as close to
business school as you can get without forking out tuition. It
amounts to a guide to investment styles of the rich and famous.
</P>
<P>
   There's an awful lot of background knowledge packed in these
essentially journalistic treatments of particular investment
opportunites: why wealthy families have historically taken the lead
in private equity investing; how funds' high-powered compensation
schemes are designed to tie investors to the firms they monitor as
tightly as possible; and what the the thicket of specialized terms
endemic to the industry actually mean.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a certain tendency to boom and bust, Lerner is
optimistic about the industry. A ``virtuous circle'' may be at
work, he says. More private equity has meant better conditions for
new investments, which in turn have led to greater capital
formation. And now perhaps the US model will successfully be
adapted overseas,
</P>
<P>
   Amar V. Bhide is an old-fashioned scholar, Harvard Business
School-trained and now teaching at the University of Chicago, who
is determined to follow in the paths of Joseph Schumpeter and
Alfred Chandler. A former McKinsey consultant and E. F. Hutton
trader, Bhide wrote ``The Origin and Evolution of Small
Businesses'' as an extended meditation on the nature of promising
start-ups and their evolution into successful businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of accident and personality can be found on every
page of ``Origin and Evolution'' _ as well as a salutary taste for
business journalism and memoirs. ``The theory of the firm has
little room for company picnics (an account of which takes up two
pages in Hewlett-Packard's `The H-P Way,') Sam Walton's hula
dances, hiring practices that trade off talent for personality
`fit,' or unilateral gift-giving to firm members to create
reciprocal obligations and loyalty,'' he writes. Yet such personal
touches often are the hallmarks of success.
</P>
<P>
   There are some questions these books can't answer _ such as when
the efflorescence of which they are a books are part will fade and
give way to some new investing enthusiasm. Bhide's book in
particular is a reminder that it was not always thus. In the 1950s
and 1960s, for instance, the conventional wisdom was that giant
corporations were required to bring new businesses into existence.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the decision of the US Treasury Department to pay down
the national debt over the next 13 years by purchasing $3.6
trillion in government obligations now held by private investors
may fundamentally change the calculus. What happens to the risky
end of the investment pool when the least risky, most liquid end of
the pool disappears? It's one more reason to expect that private
equity is here to stay.

 &HT;     SOUTHERN DEMS JOIN HANDS WITH GOP ON MARRIAGE TAX RELIEF 
 &HT;    
 By CARL HULSE and SEAN LOUGHLIN  
NYT Regional Newspapers  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While most House Democrats divorced themselves from
a Republican-crafted plan to ease the tax penalty on married
couples, Southerners were not so quick to call it quits.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of the 48 Democrats who broke ranks to embrace
the recently adopted GOP proposal represent Southern states. They
bemoaned the fact that their party's relationship with the proposal
had turned sour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the right thing to do,'' said Rep. Mike McIntyre,
D-N.C., who voted to eliminate a quirk in the tax code that results
in some married couples paying more in taxes than they would if the
husband and wife were single. ``This does not need to be a partisan
issue. If we cannot stand up for our families than what are we here
for?''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders complained the $182 billion Republican
proposal was too generous and helped high-income couples that were
not even hit by the penalty. Even some Democratic supporters agreed
but said the overall thrust of the measure merited backing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does go too far,'' said Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., adding
it wouldn't be the first time he voted for a measure he didn't
agree with 100 percent. ``But I didn't want my legacy to be voting
against that bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats complained Republicans were rushing ahead with a
tax cut. They supported only the Democratic proposal that granted
$95 billion in marriage penalty relief provided deals can be
reached on reducing the national debt and bolstering Social
Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican leadership seems to think that we can pass tax
cuts first and budget later,'' said Rep. Allen Boyd, D-Fla.
``Making a $182 billion decision without first considering how that
will impact the federal debt, the U.S. economy and critical
programs for the armed services, veterans, agriculture and
education is flat-out irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   The choice was difficult as shown by the way the issue split the
Blue Dog Coalition of moderate and conservative Democrats; half the
group supported the GOP plan, half rejected it.
</P>
<P>
   FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS
</P>
<P>
   When George W. Bush and John McCain were on the campaign trail
in the Palmetto State, they, naturally, encountered a lot of South
Carolinians. They also ran across quite a few residents from
neighboring North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that North Carolina doesn't have its presidential
primaries until May 2 _ a time when most experts expect the
nominations to be decided _ encouraged Republicans who wanted to
see some of the political action to cross the state border.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Batchelor, a sales representative from Raleigh, N.C., woke
up early one recent Saturday to attend a McCain rally in South
Carolina. ``I just wanted to see him up close,'' Batchelor said.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Greger, a mother of five and homemaker, went even further.
She drove with her husband from their home in Maryland for the same
event. Maryland holds it primaries March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm too old for this, but he makes me proud to be an
American,'' Greger said of McCain.
</P>
<P>
   POISON PEN?
</P>
<P>
   Candidates may clamor for newspaper endorsements and media
coverage, but sometimes press attention can be a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, seems to have been the thinking of Southern
conservatives bothered by the exhaustive coverage of John McCain's
candidacy. McCain landed on the cover of the three major weekly
news magazines shortly before he moved his campaign South.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Call, a Republican and a police investigator from
Charlotte, was more than a little suspicious of what he considered
to be positive coverage for McCain. ``When has the press ever
backed a Republican nominee?'' Call asked. ``What about the
limelight now?''
</P>
<P>
   That skepticism was raised again and again during the campaign
by Republicans who refused to accept that the ``liberal'' media
could find anything to like in a GOP contender.
</P>
<P>
   ENVIRONMENTAL FALL-OUT
</P>
<P>
   The Southeast might not want to take home the new report card
issued by the League of Conservation Voters. The environmental
group gave the region the second lowest score for its lawmakers'
votes in Congress during 1999, ranking it behind only the Mountain
West.
</P>
<P>
   Senators fared worse than House members with GOP Senate
delegations from Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi and Tennessee
posting zero scores for disagreeing with the group on all nine
votes it tracked.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans counter that though the group bills itself as
nonpartisan, it promotes a liberal conservation agenda.

<P>
   With a day to go before South Carolina's crucial Republican
primary election, the state is bearing the footprints of George W.
Bush and John McCain. Bush was targeting the conservative
northwest. McCain was aiming his efforts along the coast. A
distant-third Alan Keyes was traipsing around the state, too.
</P>
<P>
   ADVANTAGE BUSH AS MATCH POINT NEARS
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has the advantage over John McCain in two South
Carolina polls out Friday on the eve of Saturday's Republican
primary. Bush was ahead of McCain 52 percent to 40 percent in a
CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll (5 percentage point error margin)
released today, and had a 44 percent to 38 percent edge in an NBC
News poll (4 percentage point error margin). Bush showed an 8-point
lead among those who said they were certain to vote, while McCain
and Bush split those who said they were fairly certain to vote.
</P>
<P>
   THE WINDS, THEY ARE A' CHANGIN'
</P>
<P>
   John McCain fares better than George W. Bush against Al Gore,
says a national poll out Thursday that challenges the Bush
campaign's claim that their man is the Republican most likely to
win the White House in November. McCain led Gore 49 percent to 41
percent in the hypothetical matchup in the poll by the Pew Research
Center for the People &AMP; the Press. Bush and Gore were in a dead
heat. ``McCain is the new, exciting candidate,'' said Andrew Kohut,
director of the Pew Research Center. The poll's margin of error was
4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   THE MORE THE MERRIER
</P>
<P>
   John McCain's pollster said Friday that between 450,000 to
500,000 voters would have to turn out Saturday if McCain were to
have ``a fighting chance'' of winning the South Carolina Republican
primary. But Bill McInturff discounted predictions that the vote
totals could climb even higher: ``I can't believe we're going to
have 800,000 votes as has been reported on CNN. On the other hand,
we've never had a South Carolina primary of this magnitude where
candidates have spent so much money.'' Cox Newspapers' Andrew J.
Glass reports that only 276,000 people, about 10 percent of those
eligible, turned out to vote in the 1996 GOP contest between Bob
Dole and Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   INKLINGS OF A BIGGER CROSSOVER VOTE
</P>
<P>
   A Palmetto Poll released Thursday by Clemson University found
that the percentage of respondents who said they would vote in
South Carolina's GOP primary Saturday had risen to 45 percent this
week from 31 percent last month. Much of the increase appears to
have come from those who had previously said they would vote in the
Democratic caucuses next month or were undecided. The poll has a
4.5 percentage point error margin.
</P>
<P>
   HERE'S ONE GUY WITHOUT A WORRY
</P>
<P>
   Launching a final effort to propel conservatives to the polls on
Saturday, George W. Bush dismissed as ``weak-kneed'' those
supporters who've raised doubts about his campaign. ``I'm going to
win tomorrow; I believe that,'' Bush said Friday as he began a day
of rallies in the state's conservative northwest corner. ``These
people who are getting nervous now are going to regret getting
nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   A PLEA FOR COMPASSIONATE CONSERVATISM
</P>
<P>
   A 62-year-old Texas woman who prosecutors say killed two of her
husbands and buried them in her yard claims she is a victim of
years of domestic abuse and pleaded Friday with George W. Bush, as
Texas governor, to spare her from execution next Thursday. ``I'm
asking you to let me live,'' Betty Lou Beets said, her voice
cracking in a plea broadcast on ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
``I'm asking for mercy. And I'm asking for that compassion and I'm
praying you will allow it for me.'' Beets would be the first woman
executed in Texas since 1998, and only the second since the Civil
War.
</P>
<P>
   TAKE ANY CONCESSION YOU CAN GET
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO leaders met with Al Gore for the first time since their
endorsement of him in the fall, and got some reassurances on top
union concerns in exchange for the votes they're promising to
deliver. Gore did say he'll continue to support the Clinton
administration's push to permanently grant China normal trade
status this year _ something the AFL-CIO has pledged to fight
because of China's poor worker-rights record. But AFL-CIO President
John Sweeney said Gore stressed his sympathy with labor's position
that future trade agreements should include worker protections.
</P>
<P>
   TORN BETWEEN TWO GROUPS
</P>

   Torn between two core groups of Democrats _ union members and
African-Americans _ Al Gore tried to satisfy both Friday by phoning
in his speech to a summit on African development at a hotel in
Washington under a picket line. ``I was unable to come personally
to the hotel because the hotel workers' union Local 25 is picketing
and in solidarity with these workers, I will not cross that picket
line,'' Gore told the audience of 1,400 Americans and leaders from
African nations at the Grand Hyatt.

   DEPENDS WHO YOU'RE TALKING TO
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press compared two George W. Bush campaign press
releases from Jan. 27 announcing an endorsement by Jack Kemp. The
first was written for the minority media; the second is the generic
release posted on the Web site. Minority media: ``Former Buffalo
Bills quarterback, vice presidential nominee and Housing and Urban
Development Secretary Jack Kemp endorsed Texas Gov. George W. Bush
as president on Thursday.'' Generic: ``Leading conservative and
former vice presidential nominee Jack Kemp today endorsed Texas
Gov. George W. Bush as the candidate most worthy of the Reagan
legacy and most capable of leading America as president.''
</P>
<P>
   REAGAN AND CLINTON _ NOW THERE'S A PAIRING
</P>
<P>
   John McCain, hoping for a surge of Democrats and independents in
Saturday's primary, likened himself to Ronald Reagan and Bill
Clinton, two-term presidents who reached across party lines.
``These things are part of an inclusive party, the party of Abraham
Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan. That's what this is
really about,'' he said. ``I want a party that welcomes the Reagan
Democrats of old,'' McCain said in Greenville, S.C. ``I want a
party that says, `Come on in, come on in, there's room for you.'''
</P>
<P>
   YOU MEAN THOSE KINDLY NORTH VIETNAMESE GENTLEMEN, DON'T YOU?
</P>
<P>
   Under attack from various Asian-American organizations, John
McCain defended his use of the term ``gook'' to describe the men
who tortured him in a North Vietnamese prison camp, and said he did
not mean for the racially charged word to apply to anyone else.
``I'll call, right now, my interrogator that tortured me and my
friends a gook, OK, and you can quote me,'' he said. As McCain
discussed the subject with reporters, he was interrupted by a phone
call. After hanging up, he brought up the term again, unprompted:
``I hated the gooks, and I will hate them for as long as I live.''
</P>
<P>
   THAT OLD POISE ON THE FREE-THROW LINE
</P>
<P>
   At a campaign stop at Hope High School in Providence, R.I., Bill
Bradley talked about the campaign, about his plans and about
courage. Then he agreed to shoot some hoops. The ex-New York Knick
changed into warmup pants and a Hope High T-shirt, but warned that
the exhibition would only ``demonstrate how old I am.'' He may have
been a tad rusty, but he still was the first to hit a free-throw in
a pressure-filled exercise. He urged his audience to show
perseverance, discipline and resiliency ``when you encounter those
moments in life that are tough.''
</P>
<P>
   `GOOD OLD BOY' COMES OUT WHEN NEEDED
</P>
<P>
   Start with a joke about a woman who voted for someone else, add
dollops of ``what's in my heart'' and views on education, taxes and
national security, and you get the standard stump speech by George
W. Bush. The speech, repeated over and over, is a variety-pack of
soft humor, applause lines and attempts to define differences
between him and John McCain. But with polls showing the two
neck-and-neck just 24 hours before the South Carolina's primary,
Bush is pulling out all the stops. He's turned up his
Texas-southern accent several degrees: ``Heah me out, now,'' he
tells crowds.
</P>
<P>
   TRYING TO PICK UP WHERE THE REAGANS LEFT OFF
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush rolled two navel oranges the length of campaign
plane as it took off from Florence, S.C., and climbed at a sharp
angle en route to Myrtle Beach. ``It takes a lot of practice,''
Bush said. ``It takes a smooth release, something I didn't perfect
when I was candlepin bowling'' in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bush jokingly said he hoped orange bowling catches on,
especially if it could benefit orange growers in Florida, where
brother Jeb is governor.
</P>
<P>
   DIDN'T KHRUSHCHEV SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore indicated his desire to not just beat his rival, Bill
Bradley, but to bury him. ``All I'm concentrating on is pouring the
gas on,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   THAT'S MY BOY, AND HE DESERVES IT
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush campaigned across Michigan, saying
his son, George W., has a record of reform as governor of Texas and
has the character to be president. ``Our son, the governor of the
second-biggest state in the nation, has a proven record of doing
what he said he'd do,'' the father said. ``Most of all, at a time I
think the country is crying out for it, he has character,'' he told
several hundred at the Ukrainian Cultural Center in Warren.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN AIDE UNDER FIRE FOR ALLEGED RACISM
</P>
<P>
   A liberal lobbying group, People for the American Way, has
called on John McCain to fire his chief South Carolina strategist,
Richard Quinn, for editing a magazine that the group says published
racially insensitive material. The group's president, Ralph Neas,
wrote that Quinn's magazine, Southern Partisan, a leading journal
of the neo-Confederate movement, has repeatedly criticized the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela and Abraham Lincoln and has
depicted blacks in demeaning ways. McCain and Quinn both deny that
Quinn holds racist views.
</P>
<P>
   WHO'S THE MOST PRO-CHOICE OF ALL?
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley's campaign began running a 30-second TV ad that
promotes his strong support for abortion rights and, by
implication, questions Al Gore's. ``Of the five men running for
president, only one candidate has been pro-choice for everyone,''
the narrator says, echoing language that Gore's campaign has used
to criticize Bradley. Bradley then comes on camera and says, ``This
is the kind of issue that you can't straddle. You can't be on both
sides.'' The spot was released two days after the National Abortion
Rights Action League endorsed Gore.
</P>
<P>
   DOING QUITE WELL WITHOUT ME, THANK YOU
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, a potent fund-raiser, said he plans to help John
McCain in any way he can, but that he didn't think McCain's
campaign would need to tap his money-raising network. ``'I do not
think he has a money problem, quite frankly,'' Bauer said. ``The
reaction after New Hampshire has been so dramatic, on the Internet
and otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   ONCE THOSE KIND OF JOKES START COMING ...
</P>
<P>
   Gallows humor has come to the campaign Bill Bradley once
described as ``a joyous journey.'' Bradley campaign chief Douglas
Berman strolled into a hotel bar late one evening recently and
spotted three reporters assigned to cover Bradley. Months ago,
there might have been a dozen or more. ``So you're the only ones
left?'' Berman said with a glum laugh. After losing to Al Gore in
Iowa and New Hampshire, and with Gore widening his double-digit
lead in almost every recent poll, even Bradley seems to be grasping
for answers as to why his campaign seems stuck in neutral.
</P>
<P>
   JUST SO LONG AS HE DOESN'T TRY TO CONTRIBUTE MONEY, RIGHT?
</P>
<P>
   Although the mayor of Jerusalem said he did not want to poke his
nose into American electoral politics by endorsing a candidate, he
didn't hold back on his praise for Rudy Giuliani. Speaking at a
Giuliani fund-raiser in New York, Ehud Olmert weighed in on the New
York Senate race, denouncing Hillary Clinton and calling the New
York mayor ``the greatest friend of the city of Jerusalem.'' Seems
Olmert's big issue is whether the Israeli capital should be moved
to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. Giuliani's in favor; Clinton's not.
Jews make up 12 percent of New York's electorate.
</P>
<P>
   GENERAL GETS THEIR ATTENTION
</P>
<P>
   A letter written by Gen. Stan Spears, the South Carolina
adjutant general, endorsing George W. Bush has raised ethical
questions and angered some National Guard members. Spears' letter
was mailed to about 9,000 Guard members this week. Steering clear
of political campaigns is a revered tradition among the nation's
professional military officers, and Pentagon rules strictly
prohibit political campaigning by active-duty military personnel.
But Spears insists that his status as an elected official allows
him to endorse candidates. He's the nation's only popularly elected
National Guard commander.
</P>
<P>
   FORBES TAKING A BREATHER
</P>
<P>
   Forget all those rumors that say Steve Forbes is about to
endorse one of his two major remaining rivals for the Republican
nomination. ``It will be awhile before he makes any decision,''
Bill Dal Col, Forbes' campaign manager, told the Washington Times.
</P>
<P>
   HEY, JESSE, COME BACK AND RASSLE
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party presidential contender Pat Buchanan landed briefly
in Bloomington, Minn., on Friday to say that Gov. Jesse Ventura
should have stayed and fought for the party's future rather than
quit. ``I believe he has run away from a fight that would have been
a good fight for the people of Minnesota, a good fight on ideas and
issues,'' Buchanan said.

<P>
   LONDON _ Faced with a falling stock price and dwindling British
beer sales, Bass PLC said Friday that it was considering ``all the
options'' for its brewing business, Britain's second-largest,
raising the prospect that it will be sold as the company
concentrates on its hotel and leisure chains.
</P>
<P>
   Likely buyers include its Dutch rival Heineken and the
acquisitive South African Breweries, analysts said. ``If Bass is
for sale, we will surely study the matter,'' said Albert
Holtzappel, a spokesman for Heineken.
</P>
<P>
   Bass declined to say publicly whether its brewing business,
which produces Carling and Tennent's lagers and Caffrey's Irish
ale, was definitely on the block, but executives said selling was
one option.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process starts now,'' one executive said. ``They can come
and approach us and we will respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Price, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston,
forecast that a sale of the brewing business could raise as much as
$3.2 billion, which Bass might use to acquire a further hotel
chain.
</P>
<P>
   Bass, which exports Bass ales to the United States and also owns
the Holiday Inn, Crown Plaza and Inter-Continental hotel chains,
has seen its stock-price slip by 41 percent since April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Word of a possible sale, however, sent the share price up by
54.5 pence, or 7.8 percent, to 749.5 pence, or $12.06, and pushed
other brewery stocks higher.
</P>
<P>
   The move toward selling the brewing business reflects a much
wider ferment in the British drinks and leisure markets where
buyers have been scrambling to acquire pubs and bars.
</P>
<P>
   Punch Taverns Group Ltd. paid $4.45 billion for Allied Domecq
PLC's 3,500 British pubs last year and later sold 550 of them to
Bass. Scottish &AMP; Newcastle bought 868 pubs, restaurants and budget
hotels from the ailing Greenall's Group PLC for $1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While Britons still spend their money in pubs and bars, their
favored tipples are changing to the disadvantage of brewers, whose
erstwhile offerings of tepid ales and fizzy lagers once formed the
unchallenged staple of the country's pubgoers.
</P>
<P>
   British beer consumption fell 7 percent between 1990 and 1997,
while a set of regulations called the Beer Orders limits the number
of pubs that brewers may own. That has forced brewers, battling for
market share, to look elsewhere for growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ratings of British brewing stocks have been depressed by a
lack of growth opportunities,'' Price of Credit Suisse First Boston
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nigel Popham, an analyst with the London brokerage firm Teather
&AMP; Greenwood, said that Bass, which owns breweries in China and the
Czech Republic, had been thwarted in its ambitions to become a
global brewer and had decided to focus on high-growth leisure and
hotel businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are selling out of a business that is growing very
modestly and hoping to re-invest the proceeds where growth is much
higher _ pubs and international hotels,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bass' brewing operations contributed 19 percent of pretax profit
last year compared with 40 percent from its hotels and about 36
percent from pubs and outlets like the All Bar One and O'Neills
chains.

 &HT;    Two area composers to create religious works
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``I have an interest in the relationship of music to
worship,'' says composer Mark Gresham, adding pointedly, ``and the
deterioration of it in certain sectors, like the CCM industry.''
</P>
<P>
   By this, he means the contemporary Christian music wave ``out of
Nashville.''
</P>
<P>
   Gresham is one of two Atlanta area musicians chosen as
composers-in-residence to three local religious institutions under
a yearlong project of the American Composers Forum, a national
service agency based in St. Paul, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   Funded by the Rockefeller Foundation after an original idea from
the Charles E. Culpeper Foundation of Stamford, Conn., the project
involves six trios of churches throughout the Southeast: two in
Atlanta, one in Alabama, three in Mississippi. The composers will
receive $6,000 stipends to create music for institutional worship.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Weaver of Ellenwood, Ga., is a professor of music theory
and composition at Clayton College &AMP; State University in Morrow,Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Both will concentrate on choral works, though they also may
involve solo singers and instrumental musicians. It depends on the
needs and desires of the congregation, they explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of us will write six pieces,'' Weaver says. ``The idea is
that three pieces that will be shared among all three churches, or
in my case, two churches and a synagogue, and one piece will be
written specifically for each. That way every congregation gets
four works out of the project.''
</P>
<P>
   Each threesome has been chosen for diversity, according to
guidelines from the Culpeper Foundation (which initiated the
project with a smaller-scale version in northern Minnesota).
</P>
<P>
   In Weaver's group and one in Mississippi, a synagogue is
included.
</P>
<P>
   Gresham will work with First Congregational Church, a
predominantly African-American congregation whose senior minister,
Dwight Andrews, is also a recognized composer; a downtown
Presbyterian church with what he describes as ``a strong social
outreach mission''; and the Candler School of Theology at Emory
University, where Marian Dolan, assistant professor of church music
and choral conducting, is also repertory and standards chairman for
multicultural and ethnic concerns for the Southern division of the
American Choral Directors Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candler has an emphasis on ethnic diversity and a global
outlook,'' says Gresham, a Unitarian, who has had some of his
sacred choral works translated into Indonesian and who coordinated
a Chinese music project at an Alpharetta, Ga., middle school last
fall. A self-taught composer, he credits his musical understanding
to a high school teacher, Vicki Norman, who by coincidence sings in
the choir of Central Presbyterian Church.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver, who belongs to the Atlanta Mennonite Fellowship, says he
will probably explore Psalm texts and the words of the prophets for
his Judeo-Christian consortium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not too terrible a problem,'' he says, ``and I think of
it as a delightful opportunity.'' Now in his 13th year at Clayton
State, Weaver came to Georgia from the University of Oregon, where
he worked with the distinguished German choral conductor Helmuth
Rilling.
</P>
<P>
   The other sacred music projects in the Southeast region are:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Birmingham, Ala. All Saints Episcopal Church, Huffman United
Methodist Church, Sixth Avenue Baptist Church. Composer: Bob Moore,
Jacksonville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Jackson, Miss. Galloway United Methodist Church, New Horizon
Church, St. Richard Catholic Church. Composer: Stephen Danker,
Metairie, La.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Jackson, Miss. Northminster Baptist Church, St. Mark's
Episcopal Parish/St. Christopher's Chapel, Temple Beth Israel.
Composer: Jonathan McNair, Chattanooga, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Northern Mississippi. First United Methodist Church, Tupelo;
First Presbyterian Church, Greenwood; First United Methodist
Church, Columbus. Composer: Michael Braz, Statesboro, Ga.

WUERFFEL LOOKING TO START OVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ROBBIE ANDREU   
 The Gainesville (Fla.) Sun   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ The news blurb out of New Orleans that
flashed across the Associated Press wire last week carried with it
a sense of sadness and finality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny Wuerffel, the Heisman-winning quarterback from Florida,
has been released by the New Orleans Saints.''
</P>
<P>
   After sitting on the Saints' bench for most of three seasons,
Wuerffel's football career appeared over.
</P>
<P>
   With the announcement, it seemed the most productive and popular
player in University of Florida football history _ the quarterback
who led the Gators to a national championship in 1996 _ had read
his last defense, thrown his last pass. The news probably saddened
Gators everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But it created an entirely different reaction in the Destin home
of Jon and Lola Wuerffel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, we were all pretty happy,'' said Wuerffel's mother,
Lola.
</P>
<P>
   Happy because now Wuerffel is free to find a better situation _
a team with a passing style of offense that better fits his
strengths and abilities.
</P>
<P>
   It had become obvious he was going nowhere in New Orleans. Now
he is looking for the right place to start over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good news he was not tendered a contract by the
Saints,'' said Wuerffel's agent, Atlanta-based Mike Moye. ``There
are better systems out there to match with his talent set. Now,
we're certainly looking for a system and a team that will best suit
his style of play and talent.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent news out of New Orleans did not mean the end of his
pro career. Maybe it signals the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Wuerffel always has put the important things in his personal
life _ family, friends and a strong belief in God _ ahead of
football. And he still does. But he is not ready to give up on his
playing career just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, I want to keep playing. I think I'm capable of
playing at this level,'' he said. ``I really feel good, and I think
my arm and arm strength are better than they've ever been. I'm
excited about getting the opportunity to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Moye: ``Danny is confident he can contribute at the NFL
level, and so am I. He's going to continue to pursue an opportunity
in the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Moye has not had any serious talks with other teams yet. But
that will happen once some more prominent free agent quarterbacks
sign with teams. That will give Moye and Wuerffel a better idea
which teams have a need at quarterback and an offensive system that
would give Wuerffel a chance to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   NFL Europe is a definite possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the NFL for three years and haven't played
much,'' Wuerffel said. ``I'm looking for a place where I might have
a chance to be a full-time player, and NFL Europe might be a good
option.''
</P>
<P>
   Wuerffel pointed to the success of Kurt Warner, who led the St.
Louis Rams to a Super Bowl victory after playing in Europe last
summer. ``It shows you what can happen if you're blessed to get the
opportunity to be in the right place at the right time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Wuerffel, the University of Florida was the right place.
Coach Steve Spurrier's intricate wide-open passing offense, was a
perfect fit for Wuerffel. He didn't possess a strong arm, but he
had great leadership qualities and an uncanny ability to read
defenses and find the open receiver. He thrived under Spurrier,
piling up record numbers while leading the Gators through the most
successful four-year period in school history.
</P>
<P>
   At New Orleans, Wuerffel never appeared comfortable in the
Saints' struggling, pedestrian offense. He had limited success in
his four starts during the 1998 season, but fell to third team this
past season and did not figure in the team's future plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back really gives me an appreciation for how special a
time it was at Florida when I was there,'' he said. ``It was a
system and a situation where you could improve as a player in any
position. It was a wonderful situation for me, and I realize how
blessed I was to have the opportunity to go through that
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   After Mike Ditka _ the coach who drafted Wuerffel in the fourth
round in 1997 _ was fired at the end of the season, Wuerffel almost
expected to be released. When it happened Feb. 11, he was not
surprised.
</P>
<P>
   He has remained in New Orleans and is working out daily with a
personal trainer. He is getting himself ready for his next football
challenge, whether it be in Europe or the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to be patient and wait for the right
opportunity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Wuerffel, who was married in June, is enjoying
life with his new bride. The couple is in Houston this weekend
attending a national Christian conference. After football, Wuerffel
plans to pursue the ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very happy. Everything is wonderful,'' he said. ``I've
got a great deal to be thankful for.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   India is so last year. Africa doesn't interest us anymore,
thanks. Right this second? It's all about Palm Beach, as inspired
by Michael Kors' collection for spring. Magazines are pushing
``postmodern preppy'' and ``country club chic'' looks as if they
were the answer to the question of existence.
</P>
<P>
   So what better way to inhabit the fantasy, even if it has
nothing much to do with my life, than to check into the Breakers
Hotel with my brother, his wife and two little children?
</P>
<P>
   Even at a moment when the most excessive luxury has become
mundane, stepping into the grand old hotel _ with its chandeliers
and lingering ghosts of Astors, Vanderbilts and Rockefellers _
feels like inhabiting the pages of a fashion spread. It is both
expensive (starting at $400 a night) and democratic in the most
American sense of the word: anybody with the money is welcome to
check in (unlike certain restricted country clubs in Palm Beach).
</P>
<P>
   But the Breakers is more than a good place to stay in Palm
Beach. It's a good place to play at being Palm Beach, too. On our
first morning (after my brother and his wife take off for a 24-hour
spin in Miami, leaving me to baby-sit), the children and I find, to
our delight, a group playing croquet on the hotel's front lawn. In
white sweaters and trousers, they look terribly old-school, British
even, until I move in closer and realize that they aren't. They're
just your run-of-the-mill hobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't just croquet, it's Six Wicket Croquet, and this is
an invitational tournament,'' a woman in a white visor with the
words ``Bad Hair Day'' on it informs me. ``It might be best for the
children to step back from the lawn.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, I'm in old shorts, and Ian, my wiggly 5-year-old nephew, is
in his Batman cape. But why be so snooty? Maybe she's compelled by
her outfit to play raj, even if she's more likely from Roslyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are they all wearing white?'' I wonder aloud as we walk
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make you notice them more?'' replies my niece, Madeleine,
who is in the second grade.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the day, I notice lots of people playing at
lots of things at the Breakers. On the beach, a mother in Lilly
Pulitzer dresses her little blond daughters like dolls in matching
pastels and then gift-wraps them in big white bows. While teaching
Madeleine and Ian to ride bicycles later, I see a bride and
bridegroom playing society wedding. Then, that evening, I find
myself in a Brooks Brothers madras sports jacket playing old-money
dad.
</P>
<P>
   In the lobby, strangers smile and ask how old my children are. I
don't correct them to say I'm just their uncle. Why should I?
Nietzsche once noted that the masks we choose to wear help us to be
more ourselves. So if taking care of some adorable children while
wearing madras brings out in me the frolicsome father who is to the
manner born, even if I'm really a restless gay bachelor who is to
the subdivision born, why not? I mean, who was Estee Lauder, whose
granddaughters are oh-so-society right now, but a makeup peddler
with a dream?
</P>
<P>
   Just for the weekend, I'm the essence of postmodern Palm Beach
dad.
</P>
<P>
   On our last day, I coax Madeleine into a tangerine sundress and
pop her into my brother's bright red rental convertible. We hit
Worth Avenue, driving past Ralph Lauren's windows and all the other
stores that encourage people like me and people with a lot less
than me to dress like a million old dollars.
</P>
<P>
   I'm looking tan and entitled in my Calvin Klein shades.
</P>
<P>
   Madeleine, who has learned about Palm Beach colors over the
weekend, as well as the meaning of living in a la-la land without
poverty or pollution, says she's going to paint a picture of Palm
Beach when she's back in New York. Her ponytail is whipping in the
wind over her pink cardigan, and she looks terribly upper crust,
but she's far too young to know it or to concern herself with such
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Palm Beach is very attractive, Uncle Bobby,'' she says, ``but
it isn't very real.''
</P>
<P>
   The same might be said about me. And I might just take it as a
compliment.

<P>
   For Erica Butts, 18, a freshman at the University of Maryland,
the credit card companies scattered around campus offering gifts
like drink coolers and pens were hard to miss. They were even
harder to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have lots of free stuff, and they keep bothering you
until you can't say no,'' Butts said, recalling how she came to
receive both Capital One and Citibank Visa cards.
</P>
<P>
   She also applied for and received a third card, a MasterCard,
but decided to leave it unused. The Visa cards' combined credit
limit of $1,000 is enough, she said.
</P>
<P>
   As it continues to wrap America in plastic, the credit card
industry is turning more aggressively to college students and young
adults. Despite students' limited incomes and lack of credit
history, the market is a gold mine for card marketers: Students are
eager to establish credit records and financial independence _ and
to spend money on clothes, electronics and cars.
</P>
<P>
   Student Monitor, a marketing research firm in Ridgewood, N.J.,
says 82 percent pay their own credit card bills.
</P>
<P>
   Through one-on-one pitches, the Internet, credit information
seminars and tie-ins with travel, clothing, electronics and
automobile companies, the issuers hope to recruit first-time users
and make them lifelong customers for their cards and other
financial products. These days, students can even receive payments
for getting friends to sign up for cards.
</P>
<P>
   But financial institutions are facing growing criticism over the
ease with which college students can obtain credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's harder to get credit after graduation than it is if
you've never had a job and you're a full-time student,'' said
Robert Manning, a visiting sociology professor at Georgetown
University.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of students at four-year colleges have at least
one credit card, usually by the end of their first year, according
to Student Monitor. It says 41 percent of students carry a balance,
averaging $584. They spend an average of $131 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've tried to create this whole view that credit cards are
plastic money'' rather than debt, Manning said.
</P>
<P>
   Issuers believe their education programs help students
understand how cards work and minimize problems. ``Many students
understand that this is a way to establish credit'' and realize
that maintaining good credit is important, said Maria Mendler, a
Citibank spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Some issuers, responding to accusations that they are pushing
cards on the young and unready, sponsor seminars explaining how
credit cards work and the importance of maintaining
creditworthiness.
</P>
<P>
   These seminars, however, are also marketing opportunities.
United College Marketing Services, a credit card marketing company
in Oak Brook, Ill., often touts its seminars as fund-raisers for
student groups. The groups receive up to $3.25 for each card
application they solicit from group members or others, said Larry
Chiang, the company's president.
</P>
<P>
   Students must be 18 before they can apply for cards. Interest
rates may be based on income, on whether the students have jobs
during the school year, and on any credit history. Rates tend to be
17 percent or higher, though students near graduation sometimes get
lower rates. Some issuers do not charge annual fees; others do.
</P>
<P>
   Credit limits for student cards are relatively low, especially
at first, and range from about $300 to $1,500. Like many other
cards, the student cards offer various discounts, though they are
often tailored to students' interests, like travel, music, books
and test preparation courses.
</P>
<P>
   American Express, Citibank and Wells Fargo offer airline travel
discounts. Some Citibank cards offer points good for Sony products,
and others offer points toward the lease or purchase of cars. Most
issuers also use Web sites to offer information and card
applications to students.
</P>
<P>
   Some students, however, are balking. Dan Kirschner, 20, a junior
at Northern Illinois University in De Kalb, said his fraternity of
business students, Delta Sigma Pi, decided not to raise money
through the credit seminars.
</P>
<P>
   The group felt that the method used by the card issuer,
Discover, to calculate interest resulted in a higher rate than what
is available on most other cards.
</P>
<P>
   Discover disagreed. ``The method we use is common across the
industry.'' said Beth Metzler, a spokeswoman for Discover Financial
Services in Riverwoods, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid credit card pitches, Kimberly Wittock, a junior at the
University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, and her roommates have become
more selective about answering their phone during the day, using
caller ID to screen calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get to a point where it gets ridiculous,'' she said.
``We're bombarded by telemarketing.''
</P>
<P>
   Wittock, who has a First USA MasterCard, knows the attractive
market the students present. ``The whole mentality of buy it now
and pay later is attractive, because we don't have the money and a
little bit of plastic goes a long way.''

<P>
   Sell in May and go away.
</P>
<P>
   That bit of investor folklore lies near the heart of one of the
latest market-timing strategies to capture public attention. It's
an incredibly simple idea, involving just two moves a year: Sell
all your stocks at the very end of April and reinvest the money on
Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   I confess to being skeptical several months ago, when I started
receiving e-mail messages about the strategy, which is sometimes
called the Halloween Indicator. But I have since come to believe
that there is something to it. To be sure, the concept has
withstood a considerable amount of statistical scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, first, the historical record back to 1925 through
1998, as compiled by Ibbotson Associates, a research firm in
Chicago. Over those 73 years, large-capitalization stocks returned
4.9 percentage points more, annualized, between Nov. 1 and April 30
than they did between May 1 and Oct. 31. The difference is even
more impressive for small-cap stocks, for which the difference has
been 18.2 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the seasonal pattern is attributable to the so-called
January effect _ the tendency of all stocks, especially small caps,
to perform especially well during the first month of the year (the
overall market's sad January 2000 notwithstanding). But even if
January is ignored, stocks have still performed significantly
better in the colder months than in the May-October period.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the pattern merely flow from the fact that the stock
market has twice crashed spectacularly in October _ in 1929 and
1987. The Halloween Indicator persists even after those years are
removed from the calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some researchers suspect that the indicator may be a
statistical fluke. After all, they contend, many money managers
program their computers to continually search history for price
patterns, so it is quite likely that many of those turn out to be
meaningless coincidences. Indeed, researchers often advise that we
ignore patterns that aren't also found in other places and times.
</P>
<P>
   The Halloween Indicator acquits itself quite well in this
regard, according to a new study conducted by Sven Bouman, a
portfolio manager at Aegon, an insurer based in the Netherlands,
and Ben Jacobsen, an assistant professor in the department of
economics and econometrics at the University of Amsterdam. Of the
36 stock markets they studied outside the United States, they found
the seasonal pattern in 35 of them. It was especially pronounced in
Europe, where the contrast between stocks' summer and winter
returns was even greater than in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Halloween Indicator is not a modern phenomenon: It
has been present in Britain, for example, since 1694.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to guard against spurious price patterns is to find
a plausible explanation for why an apparent pattern should exist in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Halloween Indicator, Bouman and Jacobsen have
such an explanation. They have found that the magnitude of the
Halloween Indicator in a given country is highly correlated to the
length and timing of that country's average summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
   How would that help explain the Halloween Indicator? Through
extensive surveys, they found that many investors reduced their
equity exposure before taking their summer holidays. Such selling
puts a damper on the stock market's return during the summer months
and the reinvestment provides an extra push in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Before selling all your stocks on April 30, remember that
transaction costs and taxes can take a big bite out of the
Halloween Indicator's advantage.
</P>
<P>
   That said, however, the pattern seems real, and might provide
this general advice for investors:
</P>
<P>
   If you are ready to invest in the stock market and are looking
for the right time to do so, the Halloween Indicator suggests that
autumn offers a better climate than the spring. Conversely, if
you're going to be selling some stock, springtime is the most
favorable season. &QL;

HIS TV STINT OVER FOR NOW, MALCOLM GETS RETURNS TO THE STAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (mk)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Now that ``Caroline in the City'' has been
sent to TV heaven, Malcolm Gets must feel like a man without a
home, right? Not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old actor, who spent four seasons on the NBC comedy
series, is actually kind of happy he's no longer playing Richard,
the mopey artist and comic foil to Lea Thompson's Caroline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like if we went any more than four years, it would've
started to get stale,'' Gets said from his New York City apartment.
``We made basically 100 episodes, and it just seemed like the
perfect amount of time to do a show like that without people
getting too tired of us. Or me getting tired of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Caroline'' reruns have gone into syndication, which ensures
that Malcolm-as-Richard will always be on the air somewhere, some
time. ``I thought it was a great ride and it ended just about at
the right time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next season, they were sort of talking about ways to
really inject some fresh blood that were a little contrived,'' he
said. ``Which I think all shows that go on for that amount of time
have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gets grew up in Gainesville and also attended college here. His
artistic side blossomed during his years at the University of
Florida, where he studied theater and performed in dozens of
productions. He also appeared at the Gainesville Community
Playhouse and the Hippodrome State Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   Although his ``Caroline'' gig called for sharp comic timing,
Gets trained as a song-and-dance man. Each year during the
program's hiatus, he found stage work _ some drama, some cabaret,
some musical theater. ``I was always coming back and doing whatever
I could in that arena,'' he said. ``I just recorded a CD with
Barbara Cook and some other people _ it's an album of '30s music _
and that'll be out in about four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, I've been working on my music all along. There
just wasn't a place for it on the series. But I figure, that's
great, it just means I have that much more to show people now.''
</P>
<P>
   He's in the middle of a stretch at the famed Joe's Pub in New
York City, performing works by Mark Blitzstein, composer of the
controversial ``The Cradle Will Rock.'' Soon he'll be playing
Richard II with the American Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Offers to do another TV series have come his way, but none that
interested him. ``More than anything, it was my decision to take at
least six months off,'' Gets said. ``And it was also my decision
that I didn't want to jump into another series. Just because I'd
just done it for five years of my life, and I wanted a chance to
get back into the theater some. And maybe finally do some film
work, too, before I get into another long-term commitment like
that. Maybe in a year I'd be willing to go back into another
series.''
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm Gets left Gainesville a decade ago and defied the odds _
he got on television, and he got famous. But did he get rich?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certainly not in the boat of the cast of `Seinfeld' or
`Friends,' but I'm a lot better off than I used to be,'' he said.
``But looking at the state of the nation and the price of real
estate in this city, even I'm middle-class in New York City in the
year 2000.''

 &HT;    Gunshot issue is just one nagging question about Mount Carmel
 &HT;    (EDs: This is an editorial from Friday's Waco Tribune-Herald.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ If it wasn't a whitewash, it's a batch of laundry
gone bad. The American people have never gotten sufficient answers
about the horrific events that ended with an inferno and the deaths
of 76 people at the Branch Davidian compound, April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of attention has been focused on a couple of questions in
recent weeks. Both are troubling and in need of answers, but they
are only two among many.
</P>
<P>
   Right now the attention is on whether federal agents fired on
the Branch Davidians that day as armored vehicles pounded at their
residence. It is right and proper that a re-creation is being
staged to test the concerns voiced by two film documentaries that
flashes on an infrared tape show gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 100 such flashes are seen on that tape, leading all
civilized observers to hope that the flashes are something other
than gunfire. Even one gunshot would have been too much unless
agents were defending their lives. After all, the intent of the
operation supposedly was to safely flush the Branch Davidians out
of their shelter, not to massacre them.
</P>
<P>
   Another much-publicized issue is the use of incendiary tear gas
canisters, which at first the FBI denied using but which in fact
were used. Could they in any way have started the fire? It appears
not, since they were fired on exterior targets. But we need to know
for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Other questions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Once and for all, what was the role of the Delta Force, the
military team summoned to Mount Carmel on the trumped-up pretext
that the Branch Davidians were producing drugs? Federal officials
say that the military unit simply was observing. Truth or lie?
</P>
<P>
   _ What was the aim of the armored vehicles ramming the building?
Was it simply to insert tear gas? Was it to open a hole out of
which people would escape? Or was it to terrorize and destroy?
</P>
<P>
   _ What is the forensics evidence? Several died of gunshots on
April 19. Were these wounds all of the victims' own hands or those
of fellow Branch Davidians? Or is there evidence that the gunshots
came from outside? Troubling questions surround the remains of
Jimmy Riddle who, in addition to being shot in the head, appears to
have suffered bodily mutilation that some people theorize came from
being run over by an armored vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike an airplane that explodes over the ocean, all of the
evidence sits before us on solid ground in this case. The most
highly advanced society, with the best justice system in the world,
should be able to answer all of the above.
</P>
<P>
   A civil suit by the survivors and an independent probe into the
events should go a long way to answering some of these questions.
U.S. District Judge Walter Smith has ordered a simulation of the
infrared effects. He should allow press representatives to witness
the re-creation if for no other reason than to assure the American
people that this phase is no whitewash.

SO ELEGANT, SO UNDERSTATED, SO BLASS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Feb. 20) 
(jt) 
 By ELIZABETH HAYT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They canceled their plans, dug deep into their
closets for classic gowns and braved a cold February night in
little more than sequins and fur stoles. Nothing could keep the
FOB's _ that's Friends of Bill Blass _ from a gala on February 16
honoring the designer for his 50-plus-year career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, I go to Gstaad in mid-February for skiing, but I
changed everything,'' said the socialite Lynn Wyatt, in her strong
Houston drawl. ``But Bill doesn't get honored every day and I
wanted to come and raise the flag for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt was among the many grande dames who took turns dancing
with Blass in the ballroom of the Waldorf Astoria. In a crisp black
tuxedo and a white handkerchief tucked into a pocket, David Niven
style, a Now cigarette dangling from his lips, he glided across the
floor, leaving a trail of English cologne and smoke. In a
videotaped retrospective of his career, the speakers kept returning
to a theme: how when they first met the designer, back in the 1950s
or '60s, he seemed more like a football player or rugged country
squire than their stereotype of a dressmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Blass, 77, announced his retirement in September and sold his
business, but in some ways he has never seemed more influential.
The fall collections by American designers shown on runways earlier
this month were a parade of ladylike tweed suits with fur collars
and other examples of the understated, uptown chic that Blass has
always championed. On Monday, a new designer was named to continue
the label: Steven Slowik, 39, an American who has designed for
Ferragamo.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ballroom was packed with more than 1,100 people
summoned by the gala chairman, Philip B. Miller, the chief
executive of Saks Fifth Avenue, to raise money for Lighthouse
International, which provides services for the blind, most revelers
appeared lackluster compared to Blass' coterie of society dance
partners. They were all dressed in his signature evening wear,
purchased over the decades and never discarded: duchess satin ball
gowns, sequined column dresses and cashmere sweaters tied around
bare shoulders. Spread among three tables, the designer's adoring
clientele included Nan Kempner, Nina Griscom, Blaine Trump, Missy
Bancroft, Lynn Nesbit, Judy Peabody, Louise Grunwald, Casey
Ribicoff, Mica Ertegun, Carolyne Roehm and Ellin Saltzman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a prom,'' said the opera singer Jessye Norman, a
longtime friend of the designer, who was seated to his left (
Grunwald was to his right). ``Everyone is wearing a Bill dress,
which, of course, I did not do at my prom. But that would have been
sensational, asking my parents for a Bill Blass dress in Augusta,
Ga.''
</P>
<P>
   Blass also chose the table settings _ votive candles and
topiaries in white English garden baskets, representative of his
understated taste. ``No flowers, no plumes, no jazz,'' he said, his
voice gravelly.
</P>
<P>
   And he chose the menu, made from his own recipes for oatmeal
cookies and meatloaf. ``Meatloaf is so down home,'' the designer
said, plunging a fork into his food. ``It's a relief after all
those racks of lamb.'' The recipe was included in the goody bags
guests took home.
</P>
<P>
   The evening had begun with a slide show created by Helen
O'Hagan, a retired Saks executive, showing highlights from Blass'
country-club life. There was the young designer in his 30s, his
looks so dashing that the socialites let out a collective
``Ooh-la-la.'' When a picture of Blass and Kempner flashed on the
screen, Grunwald squealed ``Palm Beach!'' Big Band classics played
in the background, but something more syrupy, like ``Memories,''
would have been appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The videotape capturing great moments in Blass history included
runway footage and an advertisement the designer did for American
Express (``Do you know who I am?''), as well as a clip of Diana
Vreeland offering her own advertisement for Blass. ``Very becoming,
very important clothes for people interested in being very
attractive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Designers offered their memories, too. Carolina Herrara, who
attended the gala in her own camel-colored cashmere top and skirt,
a fox fur around her shoulders, recounted in the video that in the
mid-'70s, she wore her first Blass outfit to a big party and the
next day was on the cover of Women's Wear Daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such fun to see the old pictures,'' Kempner said, a
cigarette between two long fingers. ``And most of us are still
around!''
</P>
<P>
   At his tables, Blass' friends spoke of how he had given the
designer Adolfo, also in attendance, his start by lending him
$10,000 in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   When Griscom, in a red bias-cut Blass dress so up-to-the-minute
it was hard to believe it was 15 years old, passed the table,
Patrick McCarthy, the chairman of Fairchild Publications, nodded
her way and complimented Blass for keeping company only with smart
women.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, McCarthy added, it helped that the women could also
afford his clothes. Grunwald came to the designer's defense. ``Bill
Blass gave more free dresses to women who loved them but couldn't
afford them,'' she insisted.
</P>
<P>
   It was only 10 p.m. and the dance floor was packed with a crowd
trying to work off a dessert of ice cream sundaes, but Blass did
not linger at his own fete. Offering a wink here, a smooch there,
he bid farewell to his pals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was ultimately a private party, you know what I mean?''
Grunwald said, just before the guest of honor took Wyatt's arm and
disappeared into the street lined with limousines.

 &HT;    Little Richard shortchanged again, by TV
 &HT;    By Kevin Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Little Richard will brag to anyone who'll
listen that he's the architect of rock 'n' roll. While many can _
and do _ debate that bold assessment, there's one fact that's not
up for debate: Richard Wayne Penniman was a one-of-a-kind rocker
who could wail with the best of them.
</P>
<P>
   The poor kid from Macon, Ga., and the man behind such hits as
Long Tall Sally, Good Golly, Miss Molly and Keep A Knockin',
certainly didn't look like any other rock 'n' roll star. The
extravagant Jheri-curl pompadour. The garish outfits. The
pencil-thin mustache. The ghoulish pancake makeup.
</P>
<P>
   Curious fashion and makeup tastes aside, when Little Richard
began howling, ``A wop bop a loo bop a lop bam boom,'' something
magical happened. His influence on American music is unmistakable:
Jimi Hendrix and Billy Preston toured as member's of Richard's
band. The Beatles, Elvis Presley and David Bowie give him credit
for boosting their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday at 9 p.m., NBC will air Little Richard, the controversial
life story of this rock music icon. Leon (The Five Heartbeats, The
Temptations) stars as the flamboyant performer in a film that
mostly concentrates on Richard's inner demons. It's a side of
Little Richard the producers (Little Richard is an executive
producer) don't believe many know. Little Richard was always a
tortured soul, torn between his love for God and his music. For
much of his life, he struggled with his sexuality. While on a
whirlwind touring schedule, the legendary musician stole a few
minutes to chat about his life story.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why was it important to tell your story?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm 67 years old. I thought, while I'm alive, I'd like to see
it. I was hoping a theatrical movie would come out, but the deal
didn't come together in time. Right after we got this deal with
NBC, a (movie) deal came up for it. Ain't that something? Prince
wanted to do it. Prince would've been real good in it. That
would've been it! He reminds me of myself anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It seems like your life story is getting shortchanged on NBC.
You should've got four hours instead of two.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, it should have been two days like they did with The
Temptations. Most of the good things were left out.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How does that make you feel?
</P>
<P>
   A: It makes you want to cry because you wished it was there. I
just pray that the people will turn off Who Wants To Be A
Millionaire and watch me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you have a choice in who played you?
</P>
<P>
   A: I didn't have that choice. Leon is a good actor, but he don't
look like me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you like his performance?
</P>
<P>
   A: He did a good job with what he had to work with. They made
him look something like me when I was young.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you had your choice, who would you want to play you?
</P>
<P>
   A: I would've played myself because I still look good! I'm 67,
but you can't tell it. I look good! If I had a face lift, which I
haven't had, then I would really look good.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You had a significant impact on rock 'n' roll, yet you never
get that sense while watching the film. Why?
</P>
<P>
   A: I sensed that, too. I think it was only said one or two
times, ``You created this music.'' It should have came out more. I
don't knowwhy it didn't come out more.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The film paints an interesting portrait of your sexuality.
Was your bisexuality a struggle?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's never been a struggle with me. I've always had many
girlfriends and many women. I love women. The world would be
terrible without women. I'm a mama's boy. I don't have a struggle
with that. If you notice, throughout the movie, I keep a woman with
me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was there a conscious attempt to gloss over the fact that
you've always been attracted to men?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think the writer probably did that. He wrote I was into
something more that I'm not really into (voyeurism, cross-dressing,
threesomes). It was like I was a crazy sex person, and that's not
who I am.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You have every right to be bitter about how your career
turned out. Are you?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah, I never got paid for my music. I mean, I've been
through the mill. But I'm not (bitter) because God has been really
good to me.

 &HT;    'Richard' fun, but lacks depth
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Leon is one of those intense method actors.
He demands that everyone call him the character's name on the set.
He acts the part, even after the cameras stop rolling. He hangs out
at places he thinks the character would hang out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I totally live their life,'' says the 36-year-old actor, best
known for his star-making roles as a womanizing singer in The Five
Heartbeats and a tortured David Ruffin in The Temptations.
</P>
<P>
   Now Leon (he doesn't use his last name) has the title role in
Little Richard, NBC's movie about the pioneering rock 'n' roll
star. So, what exactly did he do to become one of music's most
outrageous performers?
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to drag queen shows,'' he says, laughing. ``I don't
know if Richard went to drag queen shows, but he certainly knew
them growing up.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon thought he knew Little Richard before taking the role. In
fact, he initially turned it down, believing playing such an
outlandish character would be ``detrimental'' to his career. ``I
didn't want to play someone and have people draw comparisons
between me and the character,'' he explains. ``I don't think any
actor needs that kind of scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   But actors do need good reviews, and Leon should get plenty of
those for his work in Little Richard. While the film, directed by
Robert Townsend (The Five Heartbeats) mostly fails at painting a
full-bodied portrait of Little Richard, Leon is mesmerizing as the
legendary singer. He doesn't always look like Little Richard, but
he certainly captures his wild-eyed, manic energy during the film's
musical numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But Little Richard really isn't a story about music. It's about
a man on a tortured journey of self-discovery. Little Richard grew
up with a physically abusive father (an intense Carl Lumbly) and
constantly battled inner demons. While he had firm religious
beliefs, his wild, rocker antics, at least to his mom (Jennifer
Lewis), proved he had ``a little devil in him.'' Those demons drove
Little Richard to quit the business in 1957 at the height of his
fame. After seeing a huge fireball light up the sky during a
concert in Sydney, Australia, Little Richard believed it was a sign
from God to stop performing and begin preaching. That so-called
divine sign was actually Sputnik, a Russian satellite.
</P>
<P>
   To tell such a complicated story as Little Richard's, NBC needed
four hours instead of two. Although Little Richard is lively,
entertaining and moves like a bullet, it ultimately leaves you
wanting more. Why, for instance, is Little Richard's impact on
American rock music never explored? The producers say several of
those scenes were filmed, including one with the Beatles, but were
ultimately cut. Little Richard was also an executive producer, but
he apparently wielded little clout over the project. Such omissions
from his own life story are glaring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just said, `We're going to cover the man,''' says John
Davis, one of the film's executive producers. ``He's the Jackie
Robinson of rock 'n' roll. You can't do everything in two hours.
But the story of the man is compelling, sad, happy, dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bill Kerby's and Daniel Taplitz' script also
downplays Little Richard's attraction to men. While Little Richard
is seen in the company of long-time female companion Lucille (For
Your Love's Tamala Jones), he's never in a relationship with a man.
He's only seen flirting with men by fluttering his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Was NBC nervous about Little Richard's homosexual relationships?
Leon doesn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never underestimate the power of an audience's imagination,''
he says. ``If you pique their imagination, then you can probably go
further than if you were to show something explicit on screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Little Richard certainly could have gone further into probing
this fascinating character's life story. But good golly, it's still
fun.

 &HT;    Nice Jewish boy looking for nice Jewish girl
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Perry Weisberg has dated enough women to know
what he's looking for. She should be funny and considerate and
kind. A college degree wouldn't hurt, kids are OK, and if she has a
career, that's fine but not a big deal either way. She should be
between 25 and 42, feminine and in good shape.
</P>
<P>
   And, all things considered, it would be nice if she were Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Weisberg has dated models, beauty queens, television anchors and
nurses. Some Jewish, some not. He's been engaged twice but never
married. Lately, though, the idea of tying the knot is looking
increasingly appealing.
</P>
<P>
   And, Lord knows, it sure would make his family and a lot of
other people happy.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Weisberg's parents, aunts, uncles, rabbis, siblings
and friends have been begging, cajoling, pressuring and imploring
the 42-year-old bachelor to find a nice woman, get married and have
babies. His aunt, uncle and brother even put a bounty on his head:
Twenty grand the day he ties the knot.
</P>
<P>
   The catch? She has to be Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   And that, Weisberg says, is important to him, but not a deal
breaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of Jewish men who married women just because they
were Jewish, and they have lousy marriages,'' says Weisberg, who
runs a custom lighting business in Lake Park. ``I'm only going to
go around once in this life, and I want to have as much fun as I
can.''
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the dilemma that has the older Jewish community
scratching their collective heads. ``Continuity'' _ the hope that
Jews will marry other Jews and have Jewish children _ is never far
from the lips of any Jewish Community Center program director,
rabbi or grandparent. Jewish singles clubs, Jewish dances, Jewish
Internet dating services and Jewish matchmakers fill the classified
ads and jostle for attention on the World Wide Web. Some of the
larger synagogues in New York and Los Angeles regularly draw more
than 1,000 Jews to special singles services on Friday nights.
</P>
<P>
   Which is a hopeful sign if you're a rabbi. But from the
standpoint of some demographers, it just might be too little, too
late. The attempt to stem the tide of intermarriage may at best be
triage and at worst be a final, desperate and useless howl thrown
into the hurricane of assimilation.
</P>
<P>
   With the Jewish ghettos of Europe and Brooklyn gone, and
anti-Semitism largely relegated to the history books, the majority
of American Jews are basking in a golden age unparalleled in their
4,000-year history. But a funny thing happened on the way to the
country club: The religious observance that unified Jews through so
many centuries, countries and cultures got left behind.
</P>
<P>
   What took its place? The same philosophy adopted by the vast
majority of American Baby Boomers: If it feels good, do it. And
that includes marriage and divorce and marriage again _ to whomever
you want.
</P>
<P>
   That there would even be a dilemma of free choice was
unimaginable a generation ago. In 1960, about 10 percent of Jews
married non-Jews. By 1990, that number had climbed to about 50
percent. In some cities, such as Denver and Phoenix and San
Francisco, the intermarriage rate is as high as 72 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Of those children raised in the homes of intermarried couples,
one in four will be raised as a Jew, demographers say. And just one
grandchild in 10 will grow up to consider themselves Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this the fact that Jewish fertility rates are very low
(the more educated the woman, the fewer children she is likely to
have, and Jewish Americans are twice as likely to have a college
education), and demographers predict that over the course of the
next generation, the size of the Jewish community in the United
States _ the largest in the world _ will decline from 5.5 million
to as low as 3.5 million. Three generations from now it could well
be under 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a critical juncture,'' said David Murray, an
anthropologist in Washington D.C. ``This generation will have a lot
to say about it.''
</P>
<P>
   TRIPS TO ISRAEL, GRATIS
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the 1990 demographic study that reported these
facts threw the American Jewish community into a panic. Money that
had been earmarked for Israel from the 1940s through the '80s was
suddenly rerouted to Jewish education and social events in an
effort to instill young Jews with a sense of religious identity.
Teen tours to Israel became de rigueur for Jewish kids. A program
called Birth Right Israel, started this year, has pledged to ferry
every Jewish college student to Israel for a 10-day trip, free of
charge.
</P>
<P>
   All of these social pressures have been swirling around Weisberg
as his search for a wife has progressed. Twice, he has been
engaged, once to a Catholic woman, once to a Methodist. Both
engagements broke off over the issue of the faith of the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told both of them I wanted to raise my children Jewish,''
said Weisberg, who characterizes his interest in Judaism as more
cultural than religious. ``There is such a rich heritage, and there
is a strength that can be gained when you find out where you come
from. I would really feel like I would let myself down if my
children weren't Jewish.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of his family have also been up-front in telling him he
would also be letting down them as well. Fred Weisberg, Perry's
dad, was raised as an Orthodox Jew in Brooklyn. He prayed every
morning and wore a prayer shawl under his clothes every day.
Serving in the Army during World War II marked his perspective
indelibly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met these (concentration camp) refugees, and they said we
have to keep our people alive,'' Fred Weisberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he's willing to compromise where his oldest child is
concerned if he'd just get down to the business of having some
kids. After all, he said, no matter who Perry marries, ``my
grandchildren will be Jewish because they will have my blood
running inside them.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry grew up the only Jew in his grade in a small town in West
Virginia, attended Hebrew school and was bar mitzvahed. Even though
he was a little embarrassed about being different, when he thought
about it, he considered himself Jewish
</P>
<P>
   When he was 16, the family moved to South Florida, and whatever
importance religion carried in his life suddenly grew even less
important. Athletics and then the family lighting business _ which
he went into right out of college _ took precedence. That and
meeting women, Jewish or not. And there were plenty of both.
</P>
<P>
   Weisberg is a big, affable guy, a former defensive end for the
Forest Hill High Falcons and shot putter and discus thrower at
Vanderbilt University. He moves with easy confidence and has no
problem introducing himself to strangers, male or female. In his
20s and 30s, he courted a bevy of South Florida's bathing beauties,
including a Miss America contestant and Miss North Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 30, he asked Miss North Miami Beach to marry him,
and she said yes. But a trip to her hometown of Montreal to meet
her mother, who had been a nun before she got married, put a quick
end to that. ``I think she just browbeat (her daughter) right out
of it,'' Weisberg said. ``I don't think my religion went over too
well.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was 36 he fell in love with the sister of an old college
friend from his Vanderbilt University days. He told her he wouldn't
ask her to convert but that he wanted their children to be raised
as Jews. She agreed and even began taking conversion classes. At
the same time, though, she began going to Bible study at a
Methodist church. A few months later _ and about a year into their
engagement _ she became a born-again Christian. The relationship
ended when she told him she was afraid that if she raised the
children as Jews, she would go to hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably wouldn't let myself get caught in that position
again at this point in my life,'' Weisberg said.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he dates mostly Jewish woman now. ``Eight out of
ten,'' he said. And he has come to value his heritage more as he
has grown older.
</P>
<P>
   Weisberg's concept of God is hazy, but his concept of community
is strong. He leads the Brotherhood, the men's group at Temple
Judea in West Palm Beach, and helps run the synagogue's ``Kosher
meet market'' _ a singles service _ held once a month But does
Weisberg _ and by extension, this next generation of American Jews
_ value Judaism enough to marry within the Jewish community?
Weisberg's choice, and the collective choice of the next generation
of Jews, remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   `CONTINUITY IS NOT THE RULE'
</P>
<P>
   The fact that anybody still cares about this issue _ 200
generations after the Bible says Abraham fathered the Jewish people
_ is something of a miracle to some people. Anthropologists
estimate that between 5,000 and 10,000 groups have established
independent cultural identities over that time, and only five or
six have survived to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Continuity is not the rule,'' Murray said. ``The Jews are an
extremely rare example.''
</P>
<P>
   A brief lesson in cultural anthropology: Tribes originally
gathered for protection. To maintain the health and population of
the tribe, mating rituals were created and social tradition
developed to enforce them. The institution of marriage came along
much later as a way to enforce those traditions.
</P>
<P>
   When a stronger or more successful culture came along, social
order adapted, and identities evolved and changed. Jews are a rare
case where identity stayed strong.
</P>
<P>
   And then along came the 20th century. Romance _ not family or
ethnic identity _ became the driving force behind matrimony. As the
walls between Jews and gentiles crumbled, intermarriage rates
climbed.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are some who take the position that the dissolution
of the Jewish community or any ethnic community is a natural
progression. In this new world order, people are judged on their
merits instead of their genetics. Anything short of that is
bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Levine, Weisberg's rabbi at Temple Judea, takes umbrage at
that view. It's a case of self-preservation, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been called the nudges of history. Jews have always
had a special mission, and we have given our community and our
world such a wonderful way of life. Our religion makes life sacred
and if we aren't around we won't be able to accomplish that.''
</P>
<P>
   So yes, it would be nice to see Perry Weisberg marry a Jewish
woman.
</P>
<P>
   Weisberg understands his rabbi's views. And as he has become
more involved with his religious community, the idea of continuity
means more to him.
</P>
<P>
   And yet. If he meets the right woman and she's not Jewish ...
well, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   What he really wants to know is this: ``Do you think I'm going
to get any dates out of this?''

 &HT;    Fulfilling a spiritual journey
 &HT;    By Kathy Whyde Jesse
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ God knocked three times before Ed Zeiders
answered. The third time, it was a TKO.
</P>
<P>
   Zeiders was a young man then, on the management track at AT&AMP;T.
``I got up one morning to go to work, and I was literally driven to
my knees,'' he recalls. ``It was one of the most exciting, divine
experiences. I had a clear sense that I was to go into ministry.''
</P>
<P>
   And so he got himself quickly into seminary _ Dayton's United
Theological Seminary, as a matter of fact _ earned his doctorate
from Boston University School of Theology, pastored in his home
state of Pennsylvania, and eventually held several administrative
positions in the Central Pennsylvania Conference of the United
Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the UTS board of trustees found him last summer,
when they elected him seminary president.
</P>
<P>
   As administrative resumes go, it's all pretty typical so far.
But Zeiders also earned his blue-collar chops, and they are equally
important to him _ steps, he says, on his spiritual journey:
railroad worker, phone company long lines installer, and U.S.
Marine.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he was in the Marines when God first tried to get his
attention. ``I was walking on the sidewalk by myself,'' he recalls.
``I heard my name. I turned around, and nobody was there.'' To him,
it was a spiritual sign, and he hurried to the base chaplain at
Camp Lejeune, N.C., for counsel and prayer.
</P>
<P>
   He heard God knocking again while working on electronic signals
for the Pennsylvania Railroad. One rainy day, he sat in the cab of
a truck with a wiser, older co-worker, waiting for the rain to
stop. The man turned to him and said, ``Ed, I don't know what
you're supposed to be doing, but you're not supposed to be working
for the railroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Zeiders still talks about these events with a sense
of wonder. He has a ``gee whiz'' quality that would be mistaken for
naivete by someone who doesn't know him well. He uses words like
``nifty'' and ``neat.'' At the end of a meeting _ any meeting _ he
may ask permission to pray.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed is one of the few guys I know who is unapologetically
spiritual,'' says UTS Board Chairman David Ruffer. ``Most meetings
with him either begin, or end, or both, with prayer. You can't be
offended, because that's Ed. He is an enthusiastic, bright,
energetic, committed person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 57, but I feel like I'm 35,'' Zeiders says. ``It's
spiritual energy!'' And he seems to rock on the balls of his feet
when he says it.
</P>
<P>
   It may take that kind of unbounded enthusiasm to turn around the
fortunes of the 129-year-old institution, which has fallen on some
recent hard times: an investment that went bad in 1995;
deteriorating facilities at its Dayton Triangle campus; an
endowment that Ruffer has called ``woefully inadequate'' and the
resignation of Zeiders' predecessor, Michael Nickerson, whose
leadership skills had been questioned by many faculty and board
members.
</P>
<P>
   After an almost total administrative turnover of president and
three vice presidents, ``things are stabilizing,'' says Zeiders,
who officially began his new job Jan 1. ``I have a very good
instinct. It's a spiritual thing. There is a renewed sense of
community, a sense of hopefulness.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Welborn, assistant professor of the New Testament, would
not disagree. He says Zeiders has been honest with faculty and
staff about ``the difficulties and opportunities'' the school
faces.
</P>
<P>
   Zeiders says the school needs to raise half a million dollars in
the next six months for its annual fund, which goes toward the
operating budget. An additional $10 million to $12 million needs to
be raised for capital improvements. Zeiders' wife, Joan, who has
been active in Christian education, is putting together a ``Friends
of the Library'' program to raise a minimum of $60,000 for an
online library. The current library building would become a student
center, with a food service area.
</P>
<P>
   Construction will begin soon on three student apartment
buildings, a $3 million project, for which the school will issue
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Zeiders says rebuilding the campus will be a 10-year process.
The school is waiting for the results of a feasibility study before
launching a capital campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the nuts and bolts of reviving this institution,
Zeiders is excited by its unwavering vision: to provide
``Christ-centered'' leaders for the church.
</P>
<P>
   The seminary has become increasingly ecumenical and inclusive in
recent years, and Zeiders thinks that's a good thing. The majority
of the current crop of doctoral candidates are black. In 1998, all
of the doctoral graduates were women. In the mid-1990s, the school
was led by the Rev. Daryl Ward, a Baptist. Zeiders grew up in the
Evangelical United Brethren tradition, which merged with the
Methodists in 1968. Even in childhood, it was expected that he
would participate in the life of the church, to give testimony and
to preach. ``I miss that, absolutely,'' he says. ``And some of it
is coming back into the Methodist church, I'm glad to say.''
</P>
<P>
   He outlines four ``great movements'' in the Christian church:
proclamation ministries _ ``all that we do to adore Christ;'' faith
development; missions and justice, and what he calls ``forming a
healing community: welcome the broken, heal the sick, loving,
forgiving. This is where the Gospel is practiced.''
</P>
<P>
   This last movement is where he says the Methodist church has
left him with a feeling of emptiness. The church needs to reclaim
``the power of the laity. This is the way the early church worked.
It was not a clerical hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people here (at UTS) know this. I want to build a
curriculum around these four great movements.''
</P>
<P>
   Welborn says Zeiders gives the impression that, ``for some time
now, he has been on a journey.'' People connect with the honest
charisma that comes from his blue collar background, his openness
in talking about his adult son, who is mildly mentally handicapped,
or about his step-grandson, who struggles with drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's brokenness everywhere,'' Zeiders notes. ``We need to
be open about it.'' But there is also spiritual healing. ``We've
got to get that message out.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he smiles, asks permission to pray, and takes his farewell,
grateful for every moment. ``It's been fun, hasn't it?''

LITTLE MORE OIL OUTPUT AND EXPLORATION SEEN, DESPITE PRICE RISES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, La., Okla.)   (bl)  
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Oil may not hold sway over the nation's economy the way
it once did, but in places like Houma, La., it still, to a large
degree,  &UR; is &LR;  the economy. Houma, 50 miles southwest of New Orleans,
is a major center for oil drilling and oilfield services _ the work
of helping oil giants like Exxon Mobil find and process oil.
</P>
<P>
   So with oil prices surging, these should be boom times, right?
Not necessarily. ``It's picked up to some degree, but it's
definitely not reflecting $30-a-barrel oil,'' said Robert Bergeron,
Houma's mayor, who spent 40 years in the oil business, starting as
a roughneck. ``You hear more conversations about the positive
future than any actual increase'' in activity.
</P>
<P>
   Even as oil prices hover at their highest levels in nine years,
pushed by OPEC production cuts and recovering global economic
activity, companies plan only modest production increases.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide spending for exploration and production will rise no
more than 10 to 15 percent from last year's depressed levels,
according to several predictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the longest sustained, dramatic upturn in
price not followed by a dramatic upturn in investment,'' said
Joseph A. Stanislaw, president of Cambridge Energy Research
Associates, a think tank in Cambridge, Mass. ``It's a degree of
caution that hasn't been seen in the industry before.''
</P>
<P>
   The tepid spending means that oil-patch economies that rely on
drilling and services, like parts of Louisiana, Texas and Oklahoma,
are not getting the lift they normally do when prices rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably don't answer any question as much as, `Gee, with
oil prices high, shouldn't we be seeing the economy and oil patch
take off?,''' said Timothy Ryan, dean of the University of New
Orleans college of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it's the worst of all worlds. We end up with high
crude oil prices, and high gasoline, but we don't get the positive
effects that at least some states get from the boost in the economy
that generally results from high oil prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil service stocks also reflect uncertainty about whether big
oil companies will greatly increase capital spending soon. After
OPEC announced production cuts last March, indexes that track the
oil-service industry nearly doubled in six months, as fears of
cheap, $5-a-barrel oil evaporated. But lately oil stocks have
fluctuated wildly, only recently returning to their September
highs, as investors try to figure out just how much the price surge
will help. Friday they fell sharply, along with the rest of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   There is always a lag between prices beginning to rise and
companies committing greater sums to find more oil. But as large
producers report their anticipated capital expenditures for this
year, with some even disclosing decreases, many analysts and
executives say the industry's muted reaction to this price spike is
highly unusual.
</P>
<P>
   A big reason is that a lot of companies appear unconvinced that
oil can stay close to $30, the current price for crude, or even the
low $20s. Their skepticism derives from a belief that OPEC cannot
keep member nations from cheating on production limits for long
when prices get this high. Moreover, pressure from the United
States and other countries to lift output appears to be having some
effect. On Thursday, the Saudi oil minister said oil should ideally
trade between $20 and $25, while his counterpart in Venezuela said
action needed to be taken to stabilize prices.
</P>
<P>
   That would be good news for consumers squeezed by costly heating
oil and gasoline. But even if OPEC decides at its March meeting to
increase production, it could be too late to lower gas prices by
summer, as inventories have fallen sharply in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say that even if OPEC lifts production, oil prices
could still rise. Philip K. Verleger, a senior adviser to the
Brattle Group, an economic consulting firm in Cambridge, said $40
oil would still be feasible later this year if Iraq cut off its
supply to protest United Nations sanctions. ``It's almost too late
to avoid this impending dependence on Iraq, barring an economic
slowdown,'' Verleger said.
</P>
<P>
   And even if domestic oil producers reverse course and seek out
new sources aggressively, it would not have much of an effect on
world supply and demand anytime soon: Total domestic oil production
is about 6 million barrels a day, out of more than 70 million
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from skepticism about OPEC's resolve, other temporary
factors have led oil companies to rein in spending, like the rapid
pace of mergers forcing producers to focus on integrating newly
bought companies.
</P>
<P>
   But the restraint also has deeper reasons, analysts and industry
executives say. Some producers, rethinking the growth-at-all-costs
strategy, now preach ``capital discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   That means giving careful consideration to options like debt
repayment and stock buybacks. Investors, meanwhile, have shut off
the flow of fresh capital to many exploration and production
companies. And some producers say the huge recent price swings have
shaken out many longtime drilling and service workers, leading to
labor shortages.
</P>
<P>
   All that could change quickly if oil prices keep rising, or if
OPEC continues to curb production and the industry persuades itself
that, this time, the cartel can keep its members from cheating.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, signs are that capital spending growth will be
soft.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   John S. Herold Inc., an industry researcher in Stamford, Conn.,
forecasts that worldwide spending on exploration and development
will rise 14 percent this year, to $86 billion _ far less than the
$108 billion spent as recently as 1998. The number of active rotary
drilling rigs in the United States has risen only 20 percent in the
last year, to 146, according to Baker Hughes, a Houston oil
services concern, and is still far below its highs for the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're seeing is companies being a whole lot more
discriminating in the projects they pursue with excess capital,''
said Bobby S. Shackouls, chief executive of Burlington Resources, a
large independent exploration and production company in Houston
that expects to lift capital spending this year by about a quarter,
to $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A number of independent companies, his included, have abandoned
strategies that focused mostly on production growth, Shackouls
said. ``Companies have delivered volume growth in the past,'' he
said, ``but many times that volume growth has been delivered with
returns that were less than the cost of capital required to
generate it. The market just doesn't like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The same is true at some larger companies. ``The major companies
that spend most of the money have been recently focused more on
returns,'' said J. Michael Talbert, chief executive of Transocean
Sedco Forex, in Houston, the nation's largest offshore driller.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Talbert's customers have been undertaking big projects
only after deciding they would still make financial sense even if
oil fell to $13. ``They've heightened the bar,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Talbert added that his company was beginning to see an
uptick in activity. ``I'm surprised that some of the capital plans
seem to be as limited as they are,'' he said. ``If prices stay at
$30 a barrel, somebody is going to draw an awful lot of new
wells.''
</P>
<P>
   The push to make producers rethink capital allocation is also
coming from Wall Street. A Goldman Sachs analyst, Donald Textor,
suggested in a report this month that many independent exploration
companies would benefit from large-scale stock buybacks to soak up
profits rather than pouring the money into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Higher sustained share prices,'' Textor concluded, ``will
depend on management's ability to invest cash flow wisely, either
in their respective businesses if opportunities are present or
alternatively in their own shares if valuation justifies this
capital allocation.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, most independents, still recovering from the
earlier era of cheap oil, are focused on paying down debt, and
otherwise improving their finances.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, only the larger companies are finding investors
willing to buy shares or lend money. Last year, just $125 million
was raised in initial public offerings, while debt issuance fell
sharply, the Herold firm reported. Not long ago the spigots were
wide open: In 1997 and 1998, financing from Wall Street helped
exploration and production companies make capital investments $40
billion higher than their operating cash flow, the firm reported.
In contrast, 1999 marked the first time in five years that capital
spending did not exceed cash flow _ that companies did not binge on
easy money.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Internet craze has drawn money from oil and
other slower-growth industries. But so has oil's sister business,
natural gas, a fuel used to power everything from power plants to
kitchen stoves. To many investors, demand for gas is easier to
quantify than oil, and is not dependent on the whims of OPEC
ministers half a world away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Natural gas prices are quite strong and the percentage of
capital dollars being directed toward gas is greater today than at
any other point,'' said Ken Hersh, managing director of Natural Gas
Partners, a $950 million venture equity fund in Fort Worth that
focuses on oil and gas.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, some oil producers that do have money to spend
say they have been hamstrung by a shortage of skilled oil-services
workers. Danny Biggs, vice president of Pickrell Drilling, in
Wichita, Kan., said longtime oilfield workers have been taking jobs
that pay less, like hospital maintenance. ``We just can't find the
help,'' Biggs said. ``These guys working on the rigs, they get laid
off, then they work, then they get laid off. A lot of them have
decided they want steady work.''
</P>
<P>
   The talent outflow has been speeded by demand for labor in other
fields. ``With the economy outside the oil industry doing quite
well, it's awfully difficult to convince someone to stay on and
count on this business to feed and support their family,'' said
Stephen Layton, chief executive of Equinox Oil, a private concern
in The Woodlands, Texas ``Six months or a year from now we could be
right back where we were in 1998,'' he said, making it ``a very
hard sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, demand for workers would be greater had the industry not
suffered through $12-a-barrel oil, said Layton, who likens a
typical independent producer to a man standing on the foundation of
his recently demolished house: ``The storm has passed, the sun is
shining. Aren't things wonderful? No. He's got to rebuild his
house.''

SENIOR INS OFFICIAL ACCUSED OF SPYING FOR CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: also moved in ``i'' news file) 
(HLW) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A senior official of the Immigration and Naturalization Service
accused of spying for the Cuban government was caught passing on
deliberately leaked classified material a week ago, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation said Friday. Mariano Faget, (pronounced
fah-HAY) 54, a supervisory adjudication officer for the INS, was
arrested in Miami on Thursday by FBI agents after wiretaps and
other surveillance revealed that he allegedly made unauthorized
contacts with Cuban intelligence officers in Miami and other
American cities.
</P>
<P>
   Faget, who had a ``secret'' security clearance, had been,
responsible for overseeing requests for political asylum and other
naturalization decisions, according to the FBI. Such authority
would have let him determine the fate of thousands of Cubans who
fled from their communist-ruled country and applied for asylum in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday morning, Paul E. Mallett, the
assistant special agent in charge of the FBI's operation in Miami,
said that Faget had unauthorized contacts with Cuban intelligence
officers and a Cuban-born businessman in New York City who himself
met several times during the last year with Cuban government
officials and agents. The FBI did not identify the businessman.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 11, Faget became the target of a sting when two FBI
officials visited his Miami office and asked for his assistance in
filling out papers granting asylum to a high-ranking Cuban
intelligence officer who wanted to defect.
</P>
<P>
   Faget was told, Mallett said, ``that the information he was
being entrusted with was secret and was very sensitive, that it
could not be disclosed to anyone, and that the intelligence
community was working on a very short time frame to accomplish
their mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 12 minutes after their meeting ended, Mallett
said, Faget used his personal cellular phone to call the New York
businessman and tell him that a person they both knew was working
with the Americans. After the businessman mentioned two different
names, Faget gave the name of the intelligence operative for whom
he had prepared the documents.
</P>
<P>
   Slightly before 5 p.m., Faget allegedly called the businessman
in New York again, this time from his home telephone, which
apparently was also tapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``He identified again the full name of the individual for whom
he had been asked to prepare the political asylum document,''
Mallett said. ``Faget further stated that the individual was in
fact a Cuban intelligence operative.''
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the seriousness of the case, Mallett said that the
kind of information disclosed by Faget could harm the United States
because it exposed the American counter-intelligence effort against
Cuba and could be used by Havana to cut off access to human sources
of intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Due to his position, Faget had access to classified and
sensitive INS files relating to confidential law enforcement
sources and Cuban defectors,'' the FBI said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The INS said Faget had been placed on administrative leave and
that the agency was cooperating with the FBI investigation.
Thursday night and Friday, FBI agents searched Faget's white
two-story house in Miami's Kendall suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Faget worked for the INS for 34 years. He has been described as
the highest ranking Hispanic official in the immigration agency's
South Florida district.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Herald reported Friday that Faget was born in Havana
and immigrated to the United States with his father in 1960. He
became an American citizen on Nov. 22, 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Faget is being charged with violating the Espionage Act by
``communicating national defense information to an unauthorized
person'' and with making false statements.
</P>
<P>
   Faget was taken to the Federal Detention Center in Miami
following his arrest.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The last major investigation into Cuban spying in the United
States was in 1998 when 10 suspected Cuban agents were arrested and
indicted in Miami. They were charged with trying to infiltrate
military bases and Cuban exile organizations in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In December of 1998, three months after the arrests in Miami,
the United States expelled three Cuban diplomats at the United
Nations, accusing them of spying, as well. Officials said the three
men were linked to espionage case in Miami, but because they held
diplomatic immunity they were not prosecuted.

AUDI OFFERS TT FIX AFTER 5 DEATHS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARCIA RUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Acting in response to continuing complaints that its TT sports
car is unstable, Audi of America announced last week that North
American owners could have electronic stability systems retrofitted
on their 2000-model cars. The company's German parent, Audi AG, had
made a similar offer in Europe on Feb. 4.
</P>
<P>
   The TT Coupe made its debut to great acclaim, with particular
praise for its sleek, Bauhaus-inspired design and its $31,000 base
price. The car's luster dimmed in Europe, though, after an unusual
number of high-speed crashes. Last fall, Audi announced a voluntary
recall to fit the cars with a rear air spoiler, to help hold down
the back of the car at speed, and new suspension components to
improve handling.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of accidents rose in Europe, including five
fatalities, German TT owners complained that this solution was
insufficient. The death last month of Peter Hommel, 60, a former
East German rally driver, added to the clamor. Soon after, Audi AG
said it would offer owners the option of adding the stability
system, which it calls ESP, for the equivalent of $325.
</P>
<P>
   The system uses sensors throughout the car to keep track of
speed, direction, acceleration and the angle of the steering wheel.
If the car seems on the verge of responding inappropriately _ for
example, if the tail is about to swing out _ the system instantly
applies the brake at a single wheel and reduces the speed to bring
the car back under control.
</P>
<P>
   Available in the United States on only a few sport and luxury
cars, stability controls are more common in Europe. DaimlerChrysler
added such a system to its Mercedes-Benz A-Class when that small
car proved unstable in abrupt lane changes.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Audi of America nor the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration report any American complaints about TT handling
problems. Audi said the European fatalities occurred in accidents
at speeds exceeding 110 miles an hour; such speeds are not unusual
on German autobahns but are extraordinary in North America.
</P>
<P>
   ``These all are very unfortunate incidents,'' said Jennifer
Garber, a spokeswoman for Audi of America. ``But we believe the
problem is related to unique driving conditions in Germany that
don't apply here.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the company said it thought the wisest course was
to make ESP available. ``By offering our North American TT owners
the choice of purchasing this newly available option, we confirm
Audi's intent to have one product standard worldwide,'' said Len
Hunt, vice president of Audi of America.
</P>
<P>
   ESP, an option on 2001 TTs, is easily installed when cars are
assembled, but retrofitting the complex system is harder. In
Germany, Audi is building an assembly line for retrofits at its
factory in Ingolstadt.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking a manufacturing site in the United States, Audi of
America is scrambling to find a facility. It doesn't expect to
begin installations before year-end; the price has not been
determined, but is expected to be similar to the $325 charge in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a parts shortage, Audi has had to postpone until May
installation of the suspension parts and spoiler. This work, which
is being done at no cost as part of a recall, will take place at
dealerships. The 2001 models, including a TT Roadster and a
225-horsepower version of the coupe, will arrive on schedule in May
but without these modifications, which will be retrofitted.
</P>
<P>
   Audi AG says it is continuing to study the problem. It
commissioned an independent testing firm, TUV Suddeutschland, to
evaluate the TT against 12 other sports cars. This month, the firm
issued a preliminary report saying it had not found any design
faults, material defects, component fractures or assembly faults.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that the TT, even in original trim, was ``better
than the average'' among sports cars and ``in keeping with the
state of the art.''
</P>
<P>
   The German press has been more critical. In its Feb. 5 issue,
Autobild magazine compared modified and unmodified versions of the
225-horsepower all-wheel-drive TT against the BMW Z3 2.8, Porsche
Boxster, Subaru Impreza GT, VW Golf V6 4Motion and a 1988 Porsche
911 Carerra.
</P>
<P>
   The unmodified TT Coupe ranked at the bottom of the group in
handling control, scoring 2 on a scale of 10. But with ESP it was
at the top, scoring 10 and tying with the VW, which also had a
stability system. &QL;

 &HT;    Forte becoming a fabulous freshman
 &HT;    By Pat Donahue
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. _ Michael Jordan didn't do. Neither did Vince
Carter. Nor Antawn Jamison. Same goes for Jerry Stackhouse.
</P>
<P>
   None of those gentlemen, who have gone on to NBA fame, have done
what Joe Forte is just a few games away from doing - lead the North
Carolina Tar Heels in scoring as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Forte is averaging 16 points per game, which is also good enough
for eighth in the ACC, and is third on the team in rebounds to
boot.
</P>
<P>
   He's done it so quietly, it escaped even the eagle eye of head
coach Bill Guthridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know he was our leading scorer,'' he said of
Forte.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina's freshman class was supposed to be one if its best
ever. But Jason Parker never made it into school, leaving Forte as
the lone blue-chipper making his way to Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   He has scored in double figures in all but three games and has
topped 20 points five times. Twice, he has been named the ACC
rookie of the week and in an ACC freshman class that's been
surprisingly strong - with the likes of Jason Williams, Carlos
Boozer, Damien Wilkins and Travis Watson - it's Forte who tops all
frosh scorers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Forte doesn't regard himself as the first option in the
offense, especially when older guys like Ed Cota, Brendan Haywood
and Max Owens are on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a freshman, you don't want to go out and shoot the
ball all the time,'' he said. ``The seniors have put in their
time.''
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't taken the 6-4 Forte long to get used to playing at
Carolina. With a schedule that has included five ranked teams
outside of ACC play, Forte has gotten a quick introduction into
college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely comfortable,'' he said. ``It's taken a while.''
</P>
<P>
   And Forte hasn't disappointed since starting in his first game
back on Nov. 22 against Southern California. His 24 points in the
82-65 season-opener set a UNC record for points in a debut by any
player. That helped him earn the MVP honors for the Maui
Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, for someone who averaged 22 points a game as a
senior at legendary prep powerhouse DeMatha Catholic, this was to
be expected. At least to the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joseph came from a good high school program,'' said Guthridge.
``He's an ingredient we thought we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's clearly established himself as one of the best young
players in college basketball,'' N.C. State head coach Herb Sendek
said of Forte, who has 34 points in two games against the Pack.
``We were one of the first ones to recruit him with energy and he
has lived up to what we thought he would.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't taken Forte long to want to make up for a bad
performance, either. In a 66-57 loss to Wake Forest, Forte was a
woeful 1 of 10 from the field and finished with 7 points. Given a
rematch with the Demon Deacons, Forte burned Wake for 24 points,
hitting 9 of 14 shots. He also connected on his last six
3-pointers, the first time a Tar Heel has hit a half-dozen from
three-point range since Shammond Williams did it against
UNC-Charlotte in the NCAA Tournament two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Making up for that poor effort the first time against Wake was
on the freshman's mind last Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially, I thought about the way I played at Wake. I felt
bad about it,'' he said. ``I thought the let team down.''
</P>
<P>
   His offensive outburst didn't startle his teammates. What did
was how open Wake left him on the wing to hit three after three
after three.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best shooter on the team,'' said Cota. ``I don't
understand how they left him open. He made them pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Guthridge also likes the savvy Forte brings to the floor, a
sense of not getting rattled when things are going bad - like when
a jumper isn't falling.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lot of confidence,'' Guthridge said, ``and his
teammates have a lot of confidence in him. His poise is a lot of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Offense is Forte's forte and his best output was a 27-point
shelling of Virginia, when he hit 11 of 16 shots. But scoring isn't
his only strength, according to Guthridge. When he went off for 27
against the Cavaliers, Forte also pulled down 11 rebounds and had 5
assists.
</P>
<P>
   And he's the team leader in steals with 38. Four times he's had
at least three in a game and he had four against UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I'm most impressed with is his defense. He's
becoming a very good defensive player,'' Guthridge said. ``I think
Joseph has done a very good job. As all freshmen do, he's gone
through a learning curve. I think he's going to get better and
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Forte's twice been named ACC rookie of the week but after 25
games, he's no longer a babe in the woods to his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a freshman anymore to me,'' Cota said.
</P>
<P>
   He's not playing like one, either.

PROSECUTION TO SEEK DEATH PENALTY IN SHOOTING OF MAIL CARRIER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CHRISTIAN BERTHELSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Federal prosecutors filed court papers Friday
saying they would seek the death penalty against Buford O. Furrow
Jr., the white supremacist accused of shooting five people in a
day-care center last year and killing a mail carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors would not discuss their rationale for seeking the
death penalty. Their motion was filed under seal, apparently
because it includes material about Furrow's mental health _ an
issue that may figure prominently in his defense.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow, 38, a onetime Aryan Nations member in Washington state,
spent some time in a mental hospital there. In 1998, he pleaded
guilty to charges that he threatened to stab two nurses at a
psychiatric institution after going there to seek help.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow is accused of criminal civil rights violations for the
Aug. 10 wounding of four children and a receptionist at the North
Valley Jewish Community Center in the suburban San Fernando Valley,
and the shooting death of Joseph Santos Ileto, a mail carrier on
his rounds nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow took a taxi to Las Vegas and turned himself in the next
day at the FBI office there, where authorities said he confessed
and talked of ``sending a message to America by killing Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the 16 counts in Furrow's indictment make him eligible
for the death penalty, all stemming from the shooting death of
Ileto. Investigators said Furrow told them he shot Ileto because he
was an employee of the U.S. government and because he was not
white.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 7, Attorney General Janet Reno provided written
authorization to seek the death penalty, according to documents
filed Friday. In a hearing earlier this week, Furrow's defense team
complained they had not been given adequate opportunity to argue
against a possible death sentence and asked Federal District Judge
Richard A. Paez to postpone Reno's decision and order prosecutors
to submit a memo explaining their reasoning. The judge declined.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow's lawyers have until April 24 to file motions challenging
death penalty statutes or the government's decision. Under a
schedule worked out by both sides, the trial will not begin before
Nov. 14.
</P>

   The federal death penalty statute was re-enacted in 1988 with
drug kingpins in mind, but the range of capital offenses was
expanded in 1994 to include nearly all homicides where federal
jurisdiction exists. The Bush and Clinton administrations have
sought death sentences against 181 defendants, according to the
Federal Death Penalty Resource Counsel, a legal support group. The
most common result is that the government discontinues capital
prosecution when the defendant enters a plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   There are now 19 federal inmates on death row.

WHEN 2 GREAT LEGAL MINDS DO BATTLE AT THE NEXT LEVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Richard A. Posner published his book last
September analyzing the investigation, impeachment and trial of
President Clinton, it was not treated as just another commentator's
view of the affair. Not only is Posner a sitting judge, the chief
judge on the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, based in Chicago.
He is also, to a wide swath of intellectuals, one of the most
fascinating contemporary thinkers on the law as well as on an
astonishingly broad range of subjects. Moreover, his book, ``An
Affair of State'' (Harvard University Press), did not shrink from
blunt assertions and conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Posner charged that Clinton was indisputably guilty of perjury
and a man of shallow character and that many of his defenders in
the intellectual and academic community were blithering fools or
hypocrites or both.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Ronald Dworkin, professor of law at New York
University and the University Professor of Jurisprudence at Oxford
University, to say that the Posner book is an abomination. In the
forthcoming issue of The New York Review of Books, Dworkin writes
that the Posner book is silly, dangerous, anti-intellectual and
empty. Until now, the book has been treated with great respect and
provided enormous comfort to those repelled by the president's
actions but queasy about associating themselves with longtime
Clinton-haters. But to Dworkin, it is a partisan screed
masquerading as scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Dworkin, who is similarly revered by many scholars
as one of the greatest contemporary legal thinkers, opens a second
front of criticism when he contends that it was inappropriate and
may well have been unethical of Posner, as a sitting judge, to pass
judgment _ actually declare Clinton guilty _ in a matter that has
the potential to became a federal criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   Posner, who was shown the Dworkin piece this week, reacted with
barely muted indignation at the notion that he had behaved
unethicallly. In a four-page letter to a New York Times reporter
and in an interview, he defended himself and tossed a few charges
of his own at Dworkin.
</P>
<P>
   In short, this is an intense and _ at least to the many who
follow such things _ an exquisitely rich and intellectual feud
between two of the nation's most admired public intellectuals and
legal scholars. The disagreement carries within it not just the
possibility of delectable entertainment but also of enlightenment
as both men are renowned exponents of different law-based
philosophies. Posner is a leading figure of the University of
Chicago-based law and economics school that holds that many legal
and moral issues would best be resolved through rational economic
analysis. Dworkin is often thought of as a theorist who would like
the law to reflect moral analysis. Each method can sometimes be
best summarized by their critics; the Posner approach is sometimes
derided as coldhearted, the Dworkin way as softheaded. In any case,
The New York Times Book Review included it in its list of the 11
best books of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Dworkin opens the ethical battle with his assertion that
Posner's ``ethics in publishing a book about Clinton's impeachment
so soon after the event are open to question, because judges are
not meant to enter political controversies.''
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate his contention that Posner traveled ``well beyond
anything that could be regarded as neutral scholarship,'' Dworkin
cites a passage in the book that asserts that Clinton, ``committed
repeated and varied felonious obstructions of justice over a period
of almost a year which he garnished with gaudy public and private
lies, vicious slanders, tactical blunders, gross errors of
judgment, hypocritical displays of contrition, affronts to
conventional morality and parental authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Dworkin writes that it is ``injudicious, to put it mildly, for a
judge to make such a public parade of his own politics.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Posner said of the portion of his book quoted by
Dworkin: ``I don't think it's partisan, I think it's undeniable.
But that's a matter of opinion.'' He said he was deeply concerned
about ``being accused of a breach of judicial ethics,'' adding,
``This is the kind of thing for which one could be reprimanded.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not any violation, he said, because there was and
continues to be no pending case involving Clinton. ``A prosecution
of President Clinton while conceivable as a theoretical possibility
is not imminent and in fact almost certainly is not going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He then went on to return fire on the ethics front. It was
unethical, he said, for Dworkin to have agreed to review a book by
a scholar with whom he had jousted fiercely over the years, and for
that matter for The New York Review to have assigned it to him.
Dworkin's criticism was in a review of the Posner impeachment book
and a second Posner book about legal theory. ``Reputable magazines
do not give books to the author's enemies to review,'' Posner wrote
in his letter, ``and, if scrupulous, a person asked to review an
enemy's books turns it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Dworkin said that he and the Review had scrupulously disclosed
in the piece that he had been a frequent object of Posner's
criticism. ``Even still, I do not consider us `enemies,''' Dworkin
said.
</P>
<P>
   All of which raises the question of whether a political and
scholarly rivalry must become personal. Each man, in interviews and
in writing, offers gracious comments about the other in the midst
of the corrosive charges.
</P>
<P>
   Dworkin calls Posner ``the wonder of the legal world'' and
writes that the volume of his scholarship is amazing. The
impeachment book, he said, has many virtues, among them being
``clear, brisk and often amusing.''
</P>
<P>
   He has invited Posner to his seminars at New York University
several times, he noted. Posner, for his part, said that Dworkin
had a ``supple intellect'' and had always been pleasant and
civilized in their disagreements. In The Harvard Law Review, Posner
once called Dworkin one of the ``leading scholars of jurisprudence
in the English-speaking world.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet this latest battle may have taken the disagreement over some
sort of line. ``I think Dworkin is a mild-mannered person who goes
overboard when he has a pen in his hand,'' Posner said. Speaking of
the judicial ethics issue, he said, ``I don't think I have ever
done anything publicly that calls into question his character.''

 &HT;    A preview of the fall fashion trends
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Faster than a supermodel can strip to her undies, the
fashion world can get plenty ugly.
</P>
<P>
   It devolved into a less-than-pretty scene last week, when
designers displayed their fall wares at Bryant Park and elsewhere
around town.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-fur activists invaded runways, spilling red paint and
hurling cream pies. Photographers walked out of Donna Karan's
Seventh Avenue venue, minutes before showtime, to protest the
impossibly cramped quarters. Buyers, editors and fashion groupies
reenacted the heyday of Studio 54 as they tried to bully their way
past the velvet rope at the Vivienne Westwood show (The Palm Beach
Post, it should be noted, wasn't even allowed to join the line of
folks jockeying to get in).
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, the clothes themselves were a largely joyless lot.
</P>
<P>
   If this were a fashion show, we'd make you wait another 45
minutes before presenting the awards. But since we understand that
everyone has deadlines, here are the week's winners, losers and
fashion victims: Midway through the Oscar de la Renta show, two
women from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals stepped onto
the runway and unfurled ``Fur Shame'' banners. After a few shouts
of ``fur pimp! fur pimp!'' the women were tackled by security
guards and a hotheaded photographer who felt the protesters were
unfairly disrupting the event.
</P>
<P>
   Guards hauled the women away, the show continued and the
audience _ many of them draped in mink, fox and sable themselves _
heartily applauded.
</P>
<P>
   THE MOE HOWARD PIE-THROWING TROPHY
</P>
<P>
   As Michael Kors took his runway bows, a PETA protestor tossed a
tofu-cream pie his way. Some of the dessert splattered Kors' black
jacket, but the bulk of it doused Vogue editors and celebs in the
front row.
</P>
<P>
   One of those caught in the pie's path was actress Sarah Jessica
Parker, who groused, ``gross,'' as she patted her damp hair, said
Women's Wear Daily.
</P>
<P>
   THE JACKSON POLLACK MEMORIAL PAINTBRUSH
</P>
<P>
   At the Randolph Duke show, a PETA protester attempted to throw
red paint on a fur-clad model. But guards grabbed him before he
could hit his target, and paint splattered onto five folks in the
front row, which included CNN fashion maven Elsa Klensch, InStyle
editors and celebrity stylist Philip Bloch.
</P>
<P>
   In a show of chivalry rare for the fashion world (or anywhere
else these days), veteran New York Times lensman Bill Cunningham
crossed the runway between models to offer his handkerchief to
Klensch.
</P>
<P>
   Klensch compared it to a terrorist attack, and Bloch told the
New York Post: ``I'm wearing a vintage bear coat that's like 80
years old. That bear would have been dead by now anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   THE RAINBOW COALITION RIBBON
</P>
<P>
   Along with the requisite rappers, guests at the Sean John show
included sports stars and a man of the cloth. Hoopsters Alonzo
Mourning and Patrick Ewing, New York Yankee Derek Jeter, and the
Rev. Al Sharpton and Mrs. Sharpton showed up in support of Sean
John, alias Puff Daddy (that's Puffy's mother at left).
</P>
<P>
   Even more refreshing to see were the hundreds of young men and
African-Americans. (The typical Fashion Week crowd is older and
whiter.)
</P>
<P>
   BIGGEST RIP-OFF
</P>
<P>
   Taking a cue from designer price tags, the tiny cafe inside the
Bryant Park tents charged $2 for a can of soda. No glass and you
fetch it yourself from a cooler. Overpriced even by New York
standards.
</P>
<P>
   THE PLAYING-WITH-PAIN AWARD
</P>
<P>
   Flaxen-haired model Carmen Kass, who recently broke her right
wrist in a freak bowling accident, walked several major runways
despite the cast on her arm.
</P>
<P>
   At Tommy Hilfiger, her cast was hidden by the knuckle-length
sleeves of cashmere turtlenecks. Other designers had Kass model
bulky coats. But Donna Karan didn't hesitate to dress the 5-foot-10
Estonian in a sleeveless sweater at the DKNY show.
</P>
<P>
   The color of Kass's cast cover? Go-with-anything black.
</P>
<P>
   THE ISADORA DUNCAN PRIZE
</P>
<P>
   Most dangerous fashion of the week: Catherine Malandrino's
super-long scarf, which almost dragged the floor when wrapped
multiple times around the model's neck.
</P>
<P>
   MOST LIKELY TO BE PELTED
</P>
<P>
   Zang Toi not only showed fox stoles with the heads and tails
still attached, but he also had models strut with Swarovski
crystal-encrusted cigarette holders, with lit cigarettes inside.
</P>
<P>
   COOLEST SETS
</P>
<P>
   A three-way tie between Badgley Mischka, Vivienne Westwood and
John Bartlett: Badgley Mischka created a winter wonderland (right)
with ice sculptures _ some 6 feet high, others toppled over
Stonehenge-style _ and fake snow an inch deep on the runway. It
didn't make much sense when you consider that Badgley Mischka
specializes in evening wear that's sometimes barely there, but the
ice did play up the sparkly sequined gowns.
</P>
<P>
   Westwood piled tossed-off clothes in the middle of her runway
(think teenage bedroom).
</P>
<P>
   Under two huge crystal chandeliers, Bartlett's models, whom the
designer directed to act like ``stripper socialites,'' strutted
down an elevated runway covered with a gold tablecloth and
surrounded by ``dining companions'' portrayed by male models.
</P>
<P>
   SHOW THAT WAS SO NICE TO COME HOME TO
</P>
<P>
   Nanette Lepore, hands-down, best show of the week.
</P>
<P>
   The staff was organized and herded people inside the tent in a
timely manner.
</P>
<P>
   The program notes came in a cartoony little booklet titled ``The
Glamour Girl's Guide to a Weekend in the Woods.''
</P>
<P>
   The free goodies on the seat included Godiva hot chocolate mix,
breath mints and those candy cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The backdrop of the runway was a painting of a roaring fire in a
fireplace _ just looking at it after stepping out of the New York
chill made you feel warmer.
</P>
<P>
   The breezy soundtrack included Dean Martin, Louis Prima and Ella
Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike so many other over-the-top, unrealistic designs
during Fashion Week, Lepore's clothes were both beautiful and cozy
_ a chocolate brown velvet dress (left), a plum velvet robe, a
mohair skirt in subdued shades of orange, pink and red.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing to protest here.
</P>
<P>
   RAISING THE BAR ON BAD HAIR DAYS
</P>
<P>
   Zang Toi's decision to plop a platinum blond wig on the very
brunette head of model Ivanka Trump was bad enough. But why, oh
why, did BCBG feel compelled to cover Alek Wek's closely cropped
hair in a heinous black, sparkly wig?

SHOULD YOU TALK ABOUT JOB OFFERS? 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Suppose you're happy at your job and, out of the blue,
you get an excellent job offer from another company, but for
whatever reason, you don't take it.
</P>
<P>
   Should you use the opportunity to toot your horn?
</P>
<P>
   Should you let your boss know your value out in the marketplace
is a lot higher than what your boss thinks it is? After all, maybe
you can use the offer as leverage to get a raise.
</P>
<P>
   Or should you just pat yourself on your back and forget about
the whole thing? After all, should you really let your boss know
you've made yourself available to a higher bidder?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is a tricky ``it depends.''
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, it's an expression of your market value, said
Paul D. Gonzales, director of fair employment and labor practices
at Enron Corp. in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales, who is also president of the Houston Human Resource
Management Association, said many employees who are in especially
sought-after jobs such as information technology don't seem to have
much difficulty mentioning they just got an offer that's $15,000
more than they're currently earning.
</P>
<P>
   Companies will weigh the cost of losing the employee, he said,
and treat it like a legitimate business decision.
</P>
<P>
   But bringing up an offer you're not planning to accept depends
on your feeling of job security, Gonzales said. A boss may wonder:
``Why is he out there talking?''
</P>
<P>
   It may give the boss an uneasy feeling to have an employee with
one foot on a banana peel and one foot in the office, Gonzales
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
IS IT LIKE BLACKMAIL? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's what concerned a manager at one company in Houston who
received an attractive job officer that he opted not to accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would feel like blackmail,'' said the manager, who decided
not to say a word. And he worried about damaging relations with his
boss, he said, asking not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would appear not too committed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it would sound to Donna Oppenheim, president of
Grapevine Medical Systems in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But presenting another offer could trigger a review of an
employee's salary, especially if an employee has done other
research in the marketplace that shows he's underpaid, said
Oppenheim, whose 12 employees sell electronic medical record
equipment to physicians.
</P>
<P>
   That often happens, said Ray Daugbjerg, a recruiter with the
search firm Preng &AMP; Associates in Houston. But get the offer in
writing, he warned. Don't present an offer that can't be verified.
</P>
<P>
   Daugbjerg recalled an employee at a computer software company in
Houston who got a job offer that would pay $9,000 more a year. She
had been on the job only six weeks, and after mentioning it to her
boss, the boss matched the offer so she stayed.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a more subtle approach may work well.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales recalled a lawyer whose boss just happened to walk into
her office twice just as she was studying the newspaper want ads.
She suddenly got a pay raise.
</P>
<P>
   A coincidence? asked Gonzales. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
IS THERE A DUTY TO MENTION IT? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Gonzales is cautious about mentioning a job offer an
employee doesn't plan to take, Daugbjerg has a different take on
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the self-interest factor, Daugbjerg believes an employee
has a duty to mention it.
</P>
<P>
   An employee should take the high road and should keep the
company's interest at heart, especially a publicly traded company,
he said. Your company would want to know that someone is trying to
take critical people out of its organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no,'' said Lynda Doty, vice president of marketing for
Drake Beam Morin, an outplacement firm in Houston. ``There's too
much of a danger your boss will say au revoir.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the boss doesn't say good-bye, he will certainly wonder
why you're out looking, said Doty. Any employee who spills the
beans needs to emphasize that he wasn't out in the marketplace and
that the offer just fell in his lap.
</P>
<P>
   It's good career management to listen to every job opportunity
that comes down the road, she said. But save the big announcement
for when you accept a new job and see what you can negotiate from
there.
</P>
<P>
   After all, you always run the risk that your boss may suggest it
would be a good idea to take the job offer.
</P>
<P>
   But, counters Daugbjerg, it's a good idea to find that out now
so you're not the next one who gets a pink slip.

 &HT;     BUSH CONFIDENT, McCAIN CHIDES GOP ESTABLISHMENT  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN and STEWART M. POWELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLINTON, S.C. _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush expressed confidence
Friday that he would win South Carolina's Republican presidential
primary Saturday while Sen. John McCain declared that a victory for
him would show that the Republican ``establishment can't stop us.''
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by polls showing him ahead, Bush said he was `very
optimistic about what's going to happen tomorrow. I feel great
about my chances.''
</P>
<P>
   In Charleston, McCain told a thunderous rally at the College of
Charleston that a South Carolina victory for him would mean he
would end up the eventual Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends, if we win tomorrow, we will win _ there's no way
we can be stopped,'' he declared. ``We are starting a revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain asked non-Republican voters for their support: ``I say to
independents, Democrats, libertarians, vegetarians _ come on over,
vote for me tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina once looked like a sure win for Bush until McCain
won an upset victory in the Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary, a loss
that translated into a gradual erosion of Bush's poll strength in
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But an intense week of campaigning and $3.1 million in
television and radio ads has put Bush back in the lead. A USA
Today/CNN/Gallup poll taken Wednesday and Thursday showed Bush
ahead of McCain by 52 percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   McCain campaign officials began looking ahead to the Michigan
primary on Tuesday, touting the Arizona seantor's strength in the
polls there and the endorsements of some state Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says he is not conceding the veterans vote to McCain, a
former Navy pilot who spent five years in a Vietnamese POW camp.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Bush brought Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas, to campaign
with him. At a rally at Presbyterian College here, Johnson said he
knew McCain both as a POW and a lawmaker in Washington. `He can't
hold a candle to George Bush,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's tweaking of the ``establishment'' refers to the fact
that Bush has collected the endorsements of many prominent
Republican leaders, including 175 House members, 38 senators and 26
governors. In South Carolina, he has the support of former Gov.
Carroll Campbell and veteran Sen. Strom Thurmond.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning along South Carolina's seacoast, home to many former
Northeast residents, McCain celebrated ``the great causes'' that
still lie ahead for federal government action, including caring for
hungry children, senior citizens without shelter or victims of
ethnic wars abroad. Americans can still ``serve these great
causes,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   He touted his success in New Hampshire in getting independents
and Democrats to join Republicans to generate the highest voter
turnout in state primary history. He reminded voters of his heroic
military career, saying he was ``fully, totally and completely
prepared'' to be president.
</P>
<P>
   McCain contended that a Republican capable of drawing
non-Republican voters has a better chance of winning in November.
Non-Republicans can vote in 16 of the 24 GOP presidential primaries
that follow South Carolina, including the first industrial state
primary in Michigan on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said that the Republican party has to broaden its appeal
to non-Republicans in the same way that Ronald Reagan did if the
GOP hopes to regain the White House after two successive defeats at
the hands of Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican party has gone from being an inclusive party to
being an exclusive party,'' McCain complained ``We've allowed the
special interests to take it over.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain joked that his wife Cindy, mother of their four children,
would ``never, never, never run for the U.S. Senate'' _ a swipe at
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's New York Senate campaign that
delighted the audience.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the turnout of non-Republicans would decide the
outcome on Saturday. Rep. Mark Sanders, R-S.C., a McCain supporter,
urged committed voters to call 25 friends over the next 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., another McCain supporter, held out
the prospect of an upset, telling the roaring rally in Charleston
moments before confetti and streamers showered down upon the
audience that McCain was winning the hearts of ordinary people
despite Bush's superior campaign treasury and array of endorsements
from South Carolina's GOP establishment.

   ``Money cannot buy what he's got,'' Graham said, referring to
McCain. ``We're going to rock their world tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in an interview Thursday night, compared himself to a
long-distance runner completing a lap.
</P>
<P>
   `I've got a marathoners' mentality, I really do,'' said Bush,
who runs three miles a day and has participated in marathons. `Even
though at the moment I'm focused here, my mental discipline is to
fully understand it's a long haul between now and nomination time,
a long way between now and the general election.''
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose in South Carolina, Bush said he is in the race for
the long haul. On Friday, Bush's wife Laura joined him on the South
Carolina trail after a week of appearances in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   McCain picked up the endorsement Friday of former Michigan Gov.
William Milliken and former Michigan Supreme Court James Brickley.
In a joint statement, the two Republicans said McCain was a ``true
American hero who is ready to be president.''

   DETROIT _ For better or worse, ``brand management'' is the rage
at car companies. The concept _ aiming products at distinct,
well-defined target markets _ has thrown Detroit's traditional
business model on its ear. Instead of trying to put some sort of
Pontiac in every garage, General Motors decides what kind of
customers Pontiac should have, asks them what they want and then
tries to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody in Detroit has been practicing brand management
better than the managers of Pontiac. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After facing extinction in the early 1980s, the GM division
regrouped and refocused on its heritage of high performance and
sporty styling. Long before brand management became a '90s catch
phrase, Pontiac carved out a niche as GM's excitement division.
Sales and market share rose, and Pontiac won young buyers who
showed little interest in other GM cars.
</P>
<P>
   For its biggest car, the Bonneville, Pontiac has a target market
of mostly male buyers in their mid-40s who want sporty looks but
need a practical sedan for family duty. A full-size car, the
Bonneville competes against the Chrysler Concorde and Toyota
Avalon; the sporty SSEi version aims squarely at Chrysler's
successful 300M, though neither of these large, front-drive cars
are the sport sedans they pretend to be. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I used to own a Bonneville, but when I slid behind the wheel of
the redesigned 2000 SSEi, I could tell that this brand had passed
me by. In its effort to appeal to hot-footed men, Pontiac has made
the car practically a macho caricature. It preens and growls like a
wrestler from the WWF, and its instruments have the look and feel
of an arcade game. Adolescents may love it, along with men in
midlife crises, but the red-meat Bonneville has lost its appeal to
me.
</P>
<P>
   The Bonneville, which went on sale last fall, still has
Coke-bottle lines and cat's-eye headlamps, but its tail is more
upright and the taillamps are larger. This time, exterior traits
are more exaggerated, especially on the gimmicky SSEi. Like a
weightlifter flaunting washboard abs, it shows off ribbed lower
body panels and a spoiler tacked onto the rear deck.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the feel is closer to jet-fighter cockpit than luxury
car. The center dash is angled toward the driver; the large gauges
are illuminated in red. The interior's most prominent features are
the eight air vents _ passengers tend to count them when they get
in _ that protrude from the dash. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are three trim levels. The base SE starts at $24,395. The
SLE, at $27,995, has the aggressive style and some of the high-tech
interior gadgets of the SSEi, but has the same regular-breathing
V-6 as the SE. The supercharged SSEi starts at $32,250; the SSEi
test car was just over $34,000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The SLE and SSEi have steering-wheel controls for the radio that
let the driver keep both hands on the wheel. The SSEi also has a
heads-up display that projects onto the windshield the speed,
turn-signal indicators, high-headlamp-beam indicator, low-fuel
light and radio station readout.
</P>
<P>
   The seats, buckets covered in leather in the test car, were
comfortable and supportive. The SE also offers a front bench for
six-passenger seating. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The test car allowed easy customization for two drivers. A
simple control on the center dash allows drivers to program
preferences for locking (how the horn sounds, how the lights flash
and how the car is illuminated when unlocked), climate and radio
settings and mirror adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   The Bonneville's changes are not just cosmetic. Under its new
skin, the car now rides on the same solid chassis used for the
Cadillac Seville, Buick LeSabre and the newly redesigned Oldsmobile
Aurora. The stiffer body adds heft but delivers a quieter ride, and
it should result in improved quality and crashworthiness. Indeed,
the Bonneville is far quieter than the Chrysler 300M.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the change in architecture, the latest Bonneville will
feel familiar to past owners. Engine choices haven't changed: The
SE and SLE have a workhorse 3.8-liter V-6 (205 horsepower, 230
foot-pounds of torque); the SSEi uses the same engine with a
supercharger (240 horsepower, 280 foot-pounds). Both are mated to
an electronic four-speed automatic transmission. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Bonneville's performance credentials are reasonably
impressive for a car of its size and are, in general, on par with
the 300M. With more torque, the Pontiac feels quicker, though the
Chrysler has more horsepower. A stiffer body with a longer
wheelbase and a wider track give the Bonneville a sure-footed feel
on corners.
</P>
<P>
   The Bonneville has every safety feature one would expect in this
class, plus some more. The front buckets are intended to support
occupants' bodies like a catcher's mitt cradling a ball. Headrests
are designed to reduce the severity of whiplash injuries. Shoulder
belts are integrated neatly into the seats for an uncluttered look
and comfortable fit.
</P>
<P>
   Side air bags, antilock brakes, traction control and daytime
running lights are all standard. The SSEi gets the stability system
used on Cadillacs, which helps to prevent skids.
</P>
<P>
   The list of standard features is lengthy. The SE comes with a
security system, power windows and power mirrors. The SLE adds,
among other items, a six-way power driver's seat, a six-speaker
sound system, keyless locking, a dual-zone climate control and
larger, 17-inch wheels and tires. The SSEi has 12-way-adjustable
front seats, two more speakers, a trunk accessory kit and an
outside mirror that dips when the car is shifted to reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Pontiac packs a lot of features into a roomy package, and it
deserves some credit for daring to be different. But brand
management Bonneville-style is all flash and dash, substituting
gaudy jewelry and tacked-on trim for purity of form. Contrast that
with the clean, elegant, more subtle design of the Chrysler. In
this battle of the brands, I feel more at home with the high style
of the 300M. &QL;

VOTERS UNCONCERNED THAT CAMPAIGN 2000 FEATURES MANY POLITICAL BLUE
BLOODS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ For a country like the United States that has
kings only on chessboards, where nobility is a trait rather than a
social class, where pedigrees typically concern dogs, there are a
couple of peculiar things about this presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   The first is that most of this year's major presidential
candidates arose from a privileged elite vaguely reminiscent of the
nobility that the United States has always forsworn. This is easily
the most patrician cast of contenders in many decades, and the
November general election could pit George W. Bush, a
third-generation politician who is the grandson of a senator and
son of a president, against Al Gore, the son of a senator.
</P>
<P>
   The second thing is that nobody seems to care.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was a truck driver,'' said Robert Despres, a truck
driver who watched a speech by Bush in New Hampshire. ``When I was
6 years old, I knew I was going to be a truck driver, too. So if he
wants to follow his dad and he does well, it doesn't matter to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   In Delaware, a white-haired welder named Fred Dobrzynski said he
worked for a company that had been passed down from father to son,
and said of the political dynasties: ``That's America! I don't
really have a problem with nepotism.''
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, a retired teacher named Larry Hamilton shrugged at the
thought of political dynasties in the United States. ``We have this
idea in the U.S. that anybody can grow up to be president, but we
also know that's not quite right,'' he said. ``It doesn't really
bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the central South Carolina hamlet of Wolfton, Wanda Reese
stood at the counter of her little general store and said: ``You
can't hold it against them, just because they got some advantage.
If somebody came in here and gave me a sack of gold, I'd take it.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews in recent weeks, many voters said that the
candidates had enjoyed a leg up because of their parentage. But
instead of being uncomfortable with this, some regarded a
candidate's blue blood as a plus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would probably be an asset that his father had been
president,'' Debra L. Devine, a former nurse who now is a
stay-at-home mother, said after a Bush rally in New Hampshire.
``Maybe he's had more first-hand experience.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not just Bush and Gore who grew up with famous names that
helped them launch political careers. Sen. John McCain's father and
grandfather were both well-known admirals and public figures. Steve
Forbes, who recently dropped out of the race, inherited his wealth
and fame.
</P>
<P>
   Among major candidates, only former Sen. Bill Bradley is an
exception _ his father, a banker, was a big man in a small town but
not a politician.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, although Americans sometimes poke fun at
political nepotism in countries like Japan or at the doddering
heirs who until last year filled Britain's House of Lords, it is
probably the United States that throughout its history has had the
most political dynasties. John Adams and John Quincy Adams were
father-son presidents and three other Adams descendants sought the
presidency or vice presidency. William Henry Harrison was the
grandfather of Benjamin Harrison and Theodore and Franklin
Roosevelt were distant cousins.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hess, a scholar at the Brookings Institution in
Washington, calculated in a 1965 book, ``America's Political
Dynasties,'' that, until then, 17 percent of members of Congress
had come from families that had sent at least two people to the
House or Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fascinating to see this in a country that in its
Constitution prohibits titles of nobility,'' Hess said in a
telephone interview. ``Of course we have created a nobility.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he cautioned that while a famous name helps, a rule of thumb
is that it simply allows a candidate to launch a career one rung
higher than would otherwise be possible _ for a congressional seat,
say, instead of one in the state legislature. Bush and Gore may
have been helped initially by their names, he suggested, but since
then they have emerged as contenders largely on their own
strengths.
</P>
<P>
   The success of second- and third-generation politicians this
year may also reflect the good economic times and less resentment
at privilege. Certainly none of the candidates seem bashful about
their family backgrounds, and Bush in particular refers to it in
speeches in ways calculated to win applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to selecting parents, I did a fabulous job!''
Bush sometimes tells audiences, and they roar back in approval.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there has been speculation that former President George
Bush's campaign appearances for his son in New Hampshire may have
undermined the younger Bush, by reinforcing the perception among
some voters that he is a lightweight riding on a his father's
shoulders. Since then, Bush has been more restrained about using
his father for campaign appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Some voters said that they thought there was something vaguely
undemocratic about a system that produced so many second- and
third-generation politicians, but they said it lightly and did not
seem much perturbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me, because it's not democracy,'' said Bradley J.
Wilson, an Iowa farmer. ``But I realize that you can be from that
background and still have good views.''
</P>
<P>
   While it may be that neither Bush nor Gore would have entered
politics if their fathers had not been politicians, there are also
liabilities associated with the genes. Bush wrote in his
autobiography that when he ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1978,
Ronald Reagan endorsed his primary opponent _ possibly because of
fears that a victory would have helped Bush's father if he ran
against Reagan in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to describe the political aristocracy in this
election as a trend, both because of the historic strength of
political dynasties and because the last presidential election
featured a race between two self-made men, Bill Clinton and Bob
Dole.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So why are this year's candidates so drawn from the Social
Register?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is a fluke, or perhaps it reflects the importance of
money and name recognition in campaigns today.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Harshbarger, the president of Common Cause, said that the
prevalence of familiar names underscored the pressures these days
of campaign fund raising and, in his view, the need to change the
system for financing campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have the money, you can't compete,'' he said.
Noting that several credible candidates had dropped out even before
the primaries, he added: ``The presidential selection process was
bypassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Sousa, a high school social studies teacher in Merrimack,
N.H., said that this year's presidential contest might make it a
bit more difficult to teach students that anyone can become
president. But, he quickly added, he already emphasizes to students
that the political playing field tilts here and there.
</P>
<P>
   Sousa said that today's political aristocracy is not unlike the
situation a couple of centuries ago in American history, when
wealthy plantation owners regarded themselves as an elite who would
serve the country with honesty and dedication. Referring to today's
second- and third-generation candidates, Sousa said, ``That's what
the founding fathers intended.''

`ALL THE KINGS MEN:' GALLIPOLI WITHOUT PUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The plot of ``All the King's Men'' is no more original than the
title. A group of British army volunteers in World War I find
themselves in a murderous battle. What makes these young men
different from other recruits is their prior civilian employment on
the royal estate at Sandringham and their fate, which Sunday
night's ``Masterpiece Theater'' says has entered legend.
</P>
<P>
   The viewer hardly has time to tell one volunteer from another
(except for the gardener who marries a lady's maid, who later in a
fit of grief has a hasty sexual encounter with a pacifist, but
never mind) before the battalion is shipped off to face the Turkish
army at Gallipoli. Then the action travels back and forth from the
commotion of war to the idyllic precincts of Sandringham, which is
notable for the presence of Maggie Smith, who plays Queen Alexandra
with royal restraint.
</P>
<P>
   The battalion is led by Capt. Frank Beck (David Jason), who
treats his lads with doses of discipline softened by affection.
Also on duty is a doctor (Patrick Malahide), who is given to
cynical comments about war and this and that, and a lieutenant of
aristocratic lineage (Stuart Bunce), who quotes from the Greek
classics and from Rupert Brooke. There is a battle, which,
disconcertingly, leaves neither survivors nor corpses.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the estate, King George V (David Troughton) and Queen
Mary (Gaye Brown) keep chins up while Alexandra undertakes to learn
what happened to her former gardeners and grooms. Did a mist cover
them at a decisive moment? Did a cloud come down upon them?
Patience: the tale ends with an explanation of where all the young
men went.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps ``All the King's Men'' is unfortunate in arriving so
soon after such superior accounts of men at war as ``Searching for
Private Ryan'' and ``The Thin Red Line.'' It's not that the battle
scenes lack plausibility or that the characters lack credibility,
but beyond the well-known news that war can be hell on the
battlefield and at home, this story just doesn't have much punch or
point.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Higher interest rates, dead ahead.
</P>
<P>
   That was the uncharacteristically frank message relayed by Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, in his testimony before
Congress last week. What Greenspan could not say is what investors
really want to know: how much higher rates have to go before Fed
policy makers can be sure that economic growth is not inflationary.
</P>
<P>
   Bond traders are betting that there will be three more
one-quarter-point rate increases by July, raising the federal funds
rate to 6.50 percent. It was 4.75 percent last June.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this will be enough to slow the supercharged economy is,
of course, an unknown. But Gemma Wright, interest rate strategist
at Aubrey G. Lanston in New York, sees several key areas of the
economy that must cool before the Fed can relax. ``Housing should
begin to slow; auto purchases and revolving credit need to
decline,'' she said. ``And consumer sentiment should taper off as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock market is an increasingly important part of the mix
that determines Fed actions. Greenspan even detailed how frothy
stock prices have contributed to excess demand for goods, in spite
of rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Because this demand could spawn inflation, it makes Greenspan
worry. Yet since June 30, when the Fed began raising rates, the Dow
industrials are down only 6.8 percent. And the Nasdaq composite is
up a blistering 64 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fell sharply on Friday. Midway through the rout, William
Dudley, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, said: ``The stock market
is not yet that scared of the Fed because the Fed is still in
fine-tuning mode. They're trying to find a neutral monetary policy
to make growth rates acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   If the market's swoon proves temporary, Greenspan will have to
be more aggressive on rates than many investors expect, Dudley
contended. ``Either the Fed has to raise rates quite a bit, or the
stock market has to go down quite a bit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce economic growth by 1 percentage point in a hot stock
market, the Fed would have to raise short and long-term interest
rates 1.4 percentage points, he believes. Alternatively, a 20
percent decline in overall stock prices could accomplish the same
slowdown in growth, Dudley said. He believes aggressive tightening
by the Fed is more likely.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that the economy and the stock market _ or segments
of it _ can roar as rates rise is that the Fed continues to
increase the nation's supply of money. ``The rise in interest rates
has been a reflection of strong economic performance,'' said Mickey
Levy, chief economist at the BankAmerica. ``But it's been
associated with strong money growth that is continuing to pump
liquidity into the system, fueling consumption and domestic
demand.''
</P>
<P>
   A broad money-supply measure, called zero maturity money, is
growing at an annualized rate of 8.7 percent. Although that is down
from the 14.5 percent growth at the end of 1998, it is still much
too rapid if the Fed wants to curb demand, Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing up interest rates while keeping the money spigots wide
open may reflect Greenspan's deep aversion to playing the role of
market spoiler. He wants to protect the nation from the ravages of
inflation, but also wants investors to party on. Trouble is, even
the mighty Greenspan can't have it both ways.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was a time, not long ago, when the Hayden
Planetarium quaintly combined exoticism with worn comfort. Inlaid
in the floor, in colored terrazzo, was a representation of an Aztec
calendar stone. The massive Willamette Meteorite squatted by the
museum entrance, a pitted sculpture created according to some
unreadable design. In the lobby a mural depicted the cosmology of
the Blackfeet Indians. In the domed hall itself, in the days before
prepackaged programming became the rule, a man would stand pointing
out the stars and constellations with an arrow-shaped beam of
light. And the great Zeiss projection machinery would seem,
silhouetted against the heavens, to be a creature out of ``War of
the Worlds.'' As the show began, twilight would gradually fall, a
mock skyline of houses ringing the dome beneath the blackening sky.
</P>
<P>
   There was no question about where one was or who one was in that
artificial cosmos. One was a child of earth, whose surface was
pocked by meteorites, whose peoples devised myths to make sense of
the heavens, whose contemporary citizens could sit in a city park
and learn about the constellations their ancestors had carved into
the sky and whose scientists were busy revealing that sky's true
shape and sense. The Zeiss machine, a descendant of the one
invented in 1923 for the first modern planetarium, in Germany, was
literally a projector, casting on the ceiling images in which
humanity could see a reflection of itself.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, as all New York-based earthlings know, the Rose
Center for Earth and Space opens with its reinvented Hayden
Planetarium, and it is not just the scale and ambition that are
different. If Copernicus and Galileo showed that humanity is not at
the center of the universe, here humanity is not even at the center
of the planetarium. The planetarium is not an attempt to project
the human imagination outward, giving shape to the heavens, but an
attempt to project that cosmos inward, imprinting it on the human
imagination, stupefying it. The allusions to myth, the city
buildings at twilight, the view of the stars from earth's reference
point _ all this has been put aside. Instead of bringing the cosmos
home, the home has been thrust, untethered, into the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   This de-centering is accomplished with astonishing consistency
and insistence. The building itself, with its austere beauty, is
not a cozy habitat for earthbound observers, but a formal world
into which one enters with a sense of distant admiration. There are
two walkways surrounding the Hayden sphere whose common message is
the utter inconsequence of humanity compared with the universe's
scales of space and time.
</P>
<P>
   One walkway begins with the Big Bang, with each successive inch
of the path representing the passing of 3.6 million years. One
strolls through the eons, passing photographs of each era's stars.
Then, a hundred yards and 13 billion years later, the path ends
with the span of human history put into scale: it has the width of
a human hair. The other walkway does the same to diminish the human
sense of space, proceeding from images of the immeasurably large _
``the observable universe is a billion billion times bigger than
Earth'' _ to images of the immeasurably small. In this spread of
dimension, of what importance is a 5-foot-tall Earth-based life
form?
</P>
<P>
   The planetarium show goes even further. Using computer
simulations based on data from the Hubble telescope, the enveloping
scrim of the traditional planetarium's sky is ripped aside,
revealing a stunning three-dimensional cosmos in which Earth is a
mite of stardust. Despite flaws in the exhibitions (the walkways
are more dramatic in description than experience, the Big Bang
simulation is a Big Bust), the overall effect is humbling. This
planetarium shares ambitions with the great cathedrals: all
resources are devoted to inspiring humility before greater forces.
</P>
<P>
   Yet like a cathedral, a planetarium is also meant to inspire a
kind of faith. The faith is in the human capacity to make sense of
it all, to give order to the overwhelming. And that capacity relies
on something that is at the heart of the very idea of a
planetarium: the art of projection.
</P>
<P>
   Projection is not just the ability of the Zeiss Mark IX to shine
pinpoints of light on a ceiling. It is the ability to take an
object or an idea or a perception that exists in one place and
transport it to another. Projection takes a domed room and turns it
into the observable universe; it takes 3.5 million years of time
and transforms them into an inch-long span of space; and it takes
the image of a sphere inscribed in a cube and expands it into a
building. Projection is an analogy: the relationships that exist
here also exist there. And so, if we can make sense of them here,
we might begin to make sense of them there.
</P>
<P>
   This idea is one of the great imaginative achievements of
Western science, illustrated in the fall of that legendary apple on
Newton's head. If gravity accounts for the apple's fall, why
shouldn't gravity also account for the moon's movements? Why should
a force on Earth be any different from one in the heavens?
Projection is at the heart of the very notion of scientific law:
What is true here will be true everywhere. We are not privileged to
be dwelling in an exceptional time or space; we are privileged to
be dwelling in a typical time and space.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one of the great paradoxes of modern cosmology is
that this no longer seems true. Ordinary experience bears no
relationship to what exists out there in an immense cosmos of
curled dimensions, relativistic time and black holes. But that is
due more to human limitations than to the failure of the principle.
And this planetarium is dedicated to celebrating just that: the
limitations of the human and the endurance of the principle.

   The House on Wednesday approved, 221 to 193, a bill that limits
the punitive damages against small businesses to $250,000 and
provides protection from product-related injuries for

IRRITATION GROWS OVER HIGH INTEREST RATES IN BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Many Brazilians are growing impatient with
the austere monetary policy of the country's central bank, which
this week left interest rates unchanged at 19 percent for the fifth
time since September.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidance of its president, Arminio Fraga, a former
hedge fund manager for George Soros, the bank has managed to
restore confidence in Brazil's currency, which was devalued a year
ago. But the bank's efforts to contain inflation with rates that
are among the highest in the world are increasingly viewed as
radical medicine for an economy that has stagnated much of the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't they have social vision to accompany their cold
technical analysis?'' asked Alencar Murti, the president of Sao
Paulo Commercial Association, who believes that the high interest
rates have hurt poorer Brazilians and have contributed to the
nation's crime rate.
</P>
<P>
   The growing irritation is perhaps made more acute because the
economy is displaying its first signs of vitality since 1997. Gross
domestic product rose 1.4 percent in the fourth quarter of last
year, putting growth for 1999 at .8 percent, in sharp contrast to
forecasts of a deep recession at the start of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Th unemployment rate is showing small signs of improvement. And
inflation ought to remain within the range of 6 percent to 8
percent agreed upon with the International Monetary Fund, which
provided Brazil with more than $40 billion in emergency funds.
</P>
<P>
   With such improvement, some close observers of the central bank
are questioning whether it is prudent to remain so cautious at a
time when the economy is positioned to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time to cut rates, with a positive scenario on our
side,'' said Dany Rappaport, the chief economist in Santander
Investment's Brazilian office. ``It is dangerous to keep rates so
high because that feeds a large deficit, which in turn hurts
long-term growth hopes.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has managed to cut spending and create a small budget
surplus before interest is paid on government debt. But because
much of this interest is linked to the central bank's main lending
rate, the result is a nominal deficit of nearly 10 percent of GDP,
one of the worst in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, this means that resources that could be used to
improve public security, schools and hospitals are channeled into
covering the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   The beneficiaries of the central bank's interest rate policy are
the government's creditors, which receive high returns on the
short-term notes sold to finance operations of the state. Banks,
which are the largest creditors, generally had a spectacular year
in 1999, despite lending little to the public.
</P>
<P>
   One institution, Banco Itau, reported the largest profits ever
for a private company in Brazil, $1.06 billion, for 1999. A
competitor, Unibanco, had profit growth of 30 percent, to $330
million. At a time when many other companies are struggling, such
results have stymied some people.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the central bank has been subordinate to the
finance minister and the president and has been used as a tool for
political ambitions. Fraga's conservative policies are, in that
sense, a break from the past. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
was re-elected to his second consecutive term only a year ago, has
three years left in office and cannot run again, perhaps relieving
pressure on the central bank.
</P>
<P>
   In a telling editorial this week, the financial daily Gazeta
Mercantil, normally a stalwart supporter of financial institutions
and government policies, said banks played a complex game of using
their financial analysts to defend high interest rates, often to
the detriment of the economy at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supermarkets, dairies, shoe-shiners and other producers of
goods and services that would like to work with lower rates don't
have the custom or money to maintain analysts on their payroll,''
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank does have its defenders. Albert Fishlow, an
economist at the New York investment firm Violy, Byorum and
Partners, and a former thesis adviser of Pedro Malan when the
finance minister was a student at the University of California at
Berkeley, said that today's high rates need to be put in
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real interest rates, with inflation of 6 percent, are much
lower than they were a year ago when the benchmark rate was above
40 percent and inflation was a lot lower,'' said Fishlow. ``That
means banks should already be channeling more capital into
lending.''
</P>
<P>
   Other factors, like the rising price of petroleum, could fuel
future inflation, the bank's supporters say. Or there is the threat
of higher rates in the United States, which could lure short-term
capital flows from Brazil, putting pressure on the currency.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even those who agree with the bank's recent stance on
rates say rates can't remain so high if Brazil's economy is to
enter a period of sustained growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, there are inflationary demons that justify today's
rates,'' said Roberto Macedo, an independent economic consultant.
``But it is indecent, even disastrous, to talk of wanting stronger
economic growth and improved distribution of income if rates are
kept this high for much longer.''

 &HT;    Atlanta craftsman focuses on woodturning
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Got a note recently from Roger Foster, who is known to
most woodworkers active for a few years in the Atlanta area.
</P>
<P>
   Roger is a big, tall fellow with a jolly smile, a booming laugh
and a wealth of skill and knowledge. I first met him when he was
co-partner in a custom woodworking studio in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   He abandoned that to rusticate for a few years in the wilds of
Rockdale County, raising sheep. It is a tribute to his unflagging
originality that he may well have made more money off their
excrement than their wool.
</P>
<P>
   He collected the little black pellets into five-pound bags,
devised handsome labels with the names of all the producers, and
marketed it as a high-quality garden fertilizer called
``Ba-Ba-Doo.''
</P>
<P>
   Highland Hardware, the area's foremost woodworking tool
supplier, sold the stuff in its garden section. Before long, Roger
himself, tired of harvesting sheep manure, went to work at the
store.
</P>
<P>
   He dropped out of the retail tool-selling business last year,
and is concentrating on woodturning, an art he has pursued for many
years.
</P>
<P>
   He sent along a handsome poster for a group show this winter at
the Genovese/Sullivan Gallery in Boston. It depicts two of the
large, classical vase forms typical of his work. One of them
appears to be spalted maple without any coloring, which is
something of a departure for Roger.
</P>
<P>
   He has developed over the years a technique of dyeing his pieces
in rich, deep colors which do not hide the grain.
</P>
<P>
   He's also developing a sculptural series.
</P>
<P>
   DRYING TIME AGAIN FOR FLOORBOARDS
</P>
<P>
   Another communication, of the electronic kind, arrived just the
other day from a reader who wrote to me months ago about putting
down a floor of old oak boards. His question that time involved, if
I recall rightly, whether he needed to tongue-and-groove the
boards.
</P>
<P>
   He reports that he decided not to do that. Instead, he made
certain he had good straight edges, then laid the boards down edge
to edge and kept them in place with countersunk screws.
</P>
<P>
   He was surprised to find that as winter came on, some of the
boards shrunk, ``even though the wood is 100 years old and had been
indoors for about a month before I laid the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   That really isn't surprising. It doesn't matter how old the wood
is. If it has been outdoors (covered, presumably) for 100 years,
all that means is that its moisture content reached an equilibrium
with the outdoor atmosphere about 98 years ago and has stayed that
way.
</P>
<P>
   Equilibrium outdoor moisture around Atlanta would probably be in
the area of 20 percent. Indoors, on the other hand, might be in the
range of 8 percent to 12 percent. It will take considerably longer
than a month for it to dry up that much.

IRANIANS FLOCK TO POLLS TO CHOOSE NEW PARLIAMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Clutching palm cards from their favorite
political parties and crumpled hand-drawn lists of candidates for
their national parliament, so many Iranians streamed to the polls
Friday that officials were forced to extend the voting time by two
hours.
</P>
<P>
   People were still waiting in line to vote outside of mosques and
schools in Tehran when the polls closed at 9 p.m. (1:30 p.m. EST),
12 hours after balloting had begun.
</P>
<P>
   The apparently big turnout heartened reformers who support the
country's liberal president, Mohammad Khatami, and who hoped to
ride into power on a wave of popular discontent with the right-wing
clergy that has dominated the country for 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 5,000 candidates running for the 290 seats in the
parliament, or Majlis, and vote-counting to be done by hand, the
Ministry of Interior predicted that full results may not be known
for up to three weeks. But officials said they may be able to say
within a day or two how many of Iran's nearly 38 million eligible
voters actually cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists for the reformers have said that the size of the
turnout will be a key indicator of public support for their vision
of a society where conservative Muslim clerics would no longer
regulate how people dress, what they watch on television or what
they read in their newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   But a hefty turnout might also have reflected the still powerful
authority of hardliners, who have portrayed some of their opponents
as leftist extremists and have proved themselves capable of
marshaling hundreds of thousands of people to their defense on a
moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for turning out to vote were not always because of
the lofty platforms of the different parties and independent
candidates. Some voted out of fear that they would be penalized if
they did not have the stamp in their passport showing they
participated in the elections, which the ruling clerics have
declared a religious duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be important for her when she goes to university,''
said Souzan Ibrahimi, who voted in a working-class neighborhood in
east Tehran with her 17-year-old daughter Nooshin. Both said they
voted for a list of candidates supporting Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   A large turnout of 71 percent, buoyed by the young people and
women who account for a majority of Iran's voting-age population,
is credited with lifting Khatami to the presidency in 1997. While
conservative candidates did not openly criticize the president,
support for him was the central theme of the campaign by an
eclectic coalition of reformers that included Khatami's brother,
writers, clerics and former government officials sacked for
promoting a free press.
</P>
<P>
   While he did not specifically endorse those running under his
banner, Khatami made an open pitch for change in comments after
voting in his home town of Jamaran in northern Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our society is in need of law and the rule of law,'' he said
in a statement quoted by the official Iranian news agency IRNA.
``The Majlis is the law-making house and the house of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Of those who agreed to speak with foreigners about the election,
many said they voted for the pro-Khatami candidates. But they also
said they hedged their bets by voting for some of the
self-proclaimed moderates, like the former president, Ali Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani, and a few familiar right-wing names as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Khatami people win too big a majority in the Majlis,
there could be trouble here,'' said one man, who would not give his
name, after voting in an upper-middle class neighborhood of north
Tehran. ``I'd rather there was fighting in the Majlis than fighting
on the streets.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since Khatami's election, his opponents in and out of the
government have tried to head off another big win for the
reformers.
</P>
<P>
   A leading reform cleric, Abdullah Nouri, was convicted of
apostasy and sent to prison three months ago after he criticized
the near-absolute powers granted by Iran's constitution to a
non-elected religious ``supreme leader.'' He had been considered a
favorite to win a Majlis seat on the reformers' list.
</P>
<P>
   The Majlis also recently increased the voting age to 16 years
old from 15, eliminating an estimated 1.5 million young people who
might have voted for the liberals from the voter lists. It also
lowered the bar for all parliamentary candidates to 25 percent of
the vote from 33 percent and cut the hours of voting to a maximum
of 12 hours from 14.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the polling stations in the Tehran area were
packed, with women wrapped in the enveloping black chador,
teen-agers in blue jeans, and men dressed in business suits and
ties. There were no private voting booths so people clustered
around the posted lists of candidates, sometimes discussing until
the last moment which of the 2,000 they would choose for the 30
spots from Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   At the Imam Hussein mosque in east Tehran, Masoumeh Ramazoni
consulted a creased strip of paper with the names of 30 candidates
that her family and friends had agreed on after a long night of
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really had to do a lot of research,'' Ramazoni said. ``I
read all their ads and looked at the level of education they had.
Most of my choices are engineers and have higher degrees.''
</P>
<P>
   Khatami has talked of creating what he calls a civil society, of
reaching out to the West and of liberalizing the stagnant public
sector dominated economy. While Iran is noticeably more open
culturally than it was before his election _ with a proliferation
of feisty newspapers, daring plays and films dealing with social
problems, and some public criticism of past government leaders _ he
has not achieved much in terms of legislation in the outgoing
conservative Majlis.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his past supporters have lost faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Khatami promised freedom but he hasn't delivered,'' said
Mariam Zhandi, an 18-year-old Tehran student who said she was
voting only for a few people she knew personally. ``I wouldn't vote
for him again.''
</P>
<P>
   Freedom for Zhandi would consist of walking in the park with her
fiancee without the fear of being picked up by the morals police
for consorting with a man before marriage. ``Once they took us to
the police station and I had to call my mom to come and get us,''
she said. ``Now I ask you: is it better for boys and girls to walk
on the street together or to go to a house where certain things
could happen?''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In the depressed southwest suburb of Islamshahr, where jobless
men rioted five years ago and were met with a violent crackdown by
police, the atmosphere in the polling places was more subdued.
</P>
<P>
   Few people spoke as they scanned the list of candidates or
huddled over their ballots. ``For every 10 people here, there are
three spies,'' said one man, nodding toward the seemingly aimless
young men hanging around the courtyard of the mosque where people
voted.
</P>
<P>
   But 78 percent of Islamshahr's votes went to Khatami two and a
half years ago _ more than his nationwide percentage. ``I don't
think much will change here in terms of the economy,'' said
Mohammad Hasani, one of the legions of unemployed in the town.
``Almost everyone will vote for the Khatami people. They represent
a little bit of hope.''

&HT;     AMERICAN CHILDREN TO HONOR WWII BRITISH FLYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Attention: Oklahoma and Texas editors)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ World War II seemed unreal to the school children
of Rattan in southeastern Oklahoma until their teacher told them
about reports of British airplane crashes in the early 1940s just
outside of town.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after long research that included e-mails to scholars in
Washington, D.C., and England, the children on Sunday will honor
four British air cadets who lost their lives in Oklahoma's Kiamichi
Mountains on Feb. 20, 1943.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids have learned a lot about themselves, America's past
and even world history'' over the last two years, said Bradley
Gernand, senior archivist at the Library of Congress in Washington,
who helped them piece together the story of the crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Joined by survivors of the crashes, families of the victims, and
British and American dignitaries, the school children plan to
unveil a monument at the crash site as their tribute to the British
flyers.
</P>
<P>
   The youngsters paid for the $1,400 granite monument themselves
by selling aluminum cans they had picked up along roads for scrap
metal.
</P>
<P>
   After the dedication, the Rattan High School Band will play
``God Save the Queen'' along with ``The Star Spangled Banner.''
``It's amazing how hard the kids have worked and how much respect
they have for those flyers who died,'' Gernand said.The children of
Rattan, a small town of about 250 people, learned that the story of
the British air cadets began in the early days of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   After the fall of France in 1940, Britain found itself alone in
the battle against Nazi Germany. It also found that training pilots
over England was difficult because of poor weather and the constant
threat of German bombing.
</P>
<P>
   So the U.S. military offered the use of American air bases to
train Royal Air Force pilots. In 1941, British air cadets began
arriving at nine air bases throughout the United States. One base
was located in Terrell, Texas, about 20 miles east of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Practicing for bombing runs over Germany, the cadets would fly
350 miles from Terrell to Miami, Okla., which is about the same
distance between England and major German cities.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 20, 1943, 19 British AT-6 planes took off from Terrell
to make the practice flight. But they ran into severe weather over
the Kiamichi Mountains near Moyers, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the single-engine, two-seat planes crashed in the
mountain range. Two plowed into hills about 20 miles northwest of
Rattan, killing the four RAF cadets. The other plane crash-landed
in a nearby field, and the pilot and navigator survived.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-five years later, the 6th-grade class in Rattan began
learning about World War II. The teacher, Beth Lawless, started the
lesson with a story of how her grandfather, Tobias Frazier, a
Choctaw Indian, served in France during the war as a
``code-talker.'' The students were fascinated to hear about the
code-talkers _ Indians who sent and received wartime messages in
their native languages to avoid interception by the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   They then asked local residents about their recollections of the
war and heard more about the British flyers who crashed in the
nearby Kiamichi range.
</P>
<P>
   The class decided to investigate the crashes and find out who
the cadets were and where they were buried.
</P>
<P>
   After reaching several dead-ends, they began corresponding with
Gernand, a friend of Lawless. Gernand, who is from Antlers, Okla,
near Rattan, spent 10 years with the University of Oklahoma Western
History Collections.
</P>
<P>
   Gernand discovered documents about the training program and gave
the children names of British archivists, who ultimately uncovered
the names of the men who died and those who survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids were amazingly dedicated to finding out what happened
and to get the names of the pilots who died,'' Gernand said.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the children learned of Henry Madgwick, an RAF
veteran who had been a cadet at Terrell and who now lives there and
serves as the town's mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Madgwick knew about the crashes and invited Lawless and her
class to Texas to see the graves of the four British cadets, who
are buried near the Terrell air base.After their visit, the
children decided to dedicate a memorial at the site of the
crashes.On Sunday, 57 years to the day after the airmen died, the
youngsters will unveil their 4-and-1/2-foot monument that features
the names of the cadets, RAF wings and a model of an AT-6 on the
top. The memorial will stand next to what local residents call the
``natural tombstone,'' a large flat rock turned up when one of the
planes went down.
</P>
<P>
   A special AT-6 flyover is planned. Members of the Choctaw Nation
will serve as color guards and will perform a 21-gun salute.
</P>
<P>
   Inscribed on the monument are the names of British cadets
Maurice Jensen of Dorset, Michael Hosier of Wiltshire, Vincent
Cockman of Essex, and Frank Frostick of Norfolk.

TURKEY SUFFERS SETBACK IN EFFORT TO JOIN EUROPEAN UNION 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Remarkable progress toward building a new
relationship between Turkey and the European Union over the last
two months is being threatened by a dispute over whether Turkey
will allow European politicians to visit an imprisoned Kurdish
leader.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute suggests that Turkey's approach to its citizens of
Kurdish descent, which has been strongly criticized by European
nations in the last decade, may be a major obstacle in its bid to
join the union.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting in December, European leaders made Turkey an
official candidate for membership. A visit by members of the
European Parliament next week was expected to be a crucial step in
bringing the two sides closer together.
</P>
<P>
   But the Europeans have canceled the trip after being told that
they would not be permitted to meet Leyla Zana, a former member of
the Turkish Parliament, who has been convicted of supporting
separatism.
</P>
<P>
   Zana is a heroine to some Europeans, and he has received the
European Parliament's peace prize. Other foreigners, including
Harold Koh, the State Department's chief human rights officer, have
been allowed to visit her in jail.
</P>
<P>
   A Turkish television report quoted government officials as
saying they feared that if they allowed the visit with Zana,
European dignitaries would then ask to visit Abdullah Ocalan, an
imprisoned leader of a Kurdish rebel army.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ankara is still in the habit of reacting to criticism from
outsiders as interference in its internal affairs,'' said Yusuf
Alatas, one of Zana's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   But some Turkish officials reacted angrily to the European
request to see Zana.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to treat Turkey as one of their colonies,'' said
Bulent Akarcali, a prominent member of Parliament. ``It is totally
unacceptable. This is clearly political blackmail.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Kurds in southeastern Turkey believe the government
discriminates against them by denying them cultural rights. But the
Turkish authorities fear that granting such rights would encourage
separatist sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   This difference of perception was on vivid display this week
when Foreign Minister Anna Lindh of Sweden visited Turkey. She met
with a prominent Kurdish politician, Mayor Feridun Celik of
Diyarbakir, and later told reporters that she supported his calls
for opening Kurdish-language schools and television stations.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Turkish military commander rejected her suggestion. In
an interview with The Financial Times, the commander, Gen. Cumhur
Asparuk, said, ``If we allow Kurdish-language broadcasting and
schools, this could tear apart the mosaic of Turkish society.''
</P>
<P>
   The Istanbul-based Kurdish Culture and Research Foundation is
being prosecuted for placing a newspaper advertisement offering
fellowships to students ``who are able to read and write Kurdish.''
The indictment charges that the offer constituted an incitement to
separatism.
</P>
<P>
   In another step that showed Turkey's continuing desire to
regulate what is said about Kurdish issues, a court last month
ordered the confiscation of all copies of a newly translated book
titled, ``A History of Kurdish Nationalism: Its Roots and
Development.'' The book was written by Wadie Jwaideh, an American
scholar of Iraqi descent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem seems to be that the word `Kurdistan' comes up
several times in the book,'' said Nihat Tuna, manager of the
publishing house that brought out the book. ``I told the
prosecutors that this is an academic work by a university
professor, and that it has no political orientation. They are now
deciding whether to bring a case against us and the translators.''

 ANALYSIS: BUSH'S MESSAGE HAS CHANGED AS McCAIN'S CHALLENGE HAS(EDS: The 2nd Take is scheduled to move by 8:30 p.m. EST) 
(lh) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas began his quest
for the presidency in a blaze of promises and good intentions,
carrying an emphatically articulated vision of the new image he
planned to establish for the Republican party and the new voters he
intended to woo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a uniter, not a divider,'' Bush said as he began a
nine-month trek to this critical juncture, and he repeated that
mantra each and every step of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Bush sang another melodious tune, too: that his campaign would
hit an indefatigably upbeat, positive note and lift people's
spirits, always making them proud. Party elders beamed, because
here, at long last, was a vibrant, youthful Republican presidential
candidate who could court voters across a wide range of the
political spectrum and match any Democrat in the sensitivity wars.
</P>
<P>
   But the trail took a twist here in South Carolina, a state that
has long smiled on more traditional Republicans. In the final weeks
leading up to Saturday's fiercely contested primary, Bush
frequently seemed harsh, assaultive and as much like a candidate of
yesterday as a candidate of tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Sen. John McCain of Arizona humbled Bush with a
19-point victory in New Hampshire, Bush has been on the attack,
hammering away at McCain's record day after day, in news
conferences and radio and television commercials. And through much
of the time, McCain unleashed several blistering attacks of his
own.
</P>
<P>
   Bush simultaneously pursued a well-trod path of political
caution, announcing unequivocally that he would shore up the
conservative Republican base in South Carolina on the same day
earlier this month that he visited Bob Jones University, a
Christian school with a controversial and well-known policy
prohibiting interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
   And, over the last few days, Bush intermittently portrayed the
election here as a contest between the Republicans who favored him
and the independents and Democrats who wanted to throw a wrench
into the process by siding with McCain.
</P>
<P>
   It was a cunning method for turning out the Republican vote, but
it cast Democrats as enemies and provided a vivid reminder that
somewhere along the way, McCain had commandeered the perception of
being the Republican able to sow support in unlikely places.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, in the end, Bush's strategy will yield him a victory
here. But at what price?
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday, a reporter edged up to this
question, but Bush confidently dismissed any concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll find out who can attract votes of independents and
Democrats in the long run,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, asked about McCain's stated desire to reinvent
the Republican party, Bush said, ``Reinvent it? I want to lead it
to victory. I want to be the person we nominate.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounded different from Bush's tenor in the past.
</P>
<P>
   To a large extent, what happened to Bush in South Carolina was
the inevitable and unremarkable product of an extraordinarily tight
race. Like any candidate in a vigorous fight, he reached out to his
most reliable supporters, and he took on his opponent as directly
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   He and his advisers rejected the notion that their engagement of
McCain has been negative, saying that Bush simply responded to what
they viewed to as lines of argument by McCain that were unwarranted
and extreme. They cited, in particular, two television commercials
in which McCain compared Bush's trustworthiness to that of
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt compelled to defend his integrity,'' said Karen P.
Hughes, the campaign's director of communications.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Bush did not abandon the oratory he had used to date,
and he frequently touted accomplishments and ideals that were not
necessarily tailored to conservative voters' strongest interests.
</P>
<P>
   He almost never talked about the importance of improving
education without noting the particular strides that he said
Hispanic and black students in Texas had made.
</P>
<P>
   He answered every question he received about illegal
immigration, a source of intense vexation for many South
Carolinians, by reminding voters that many Mexicans streamed into
the United States simply to seek a better life for their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family values do not stop at the Rio Grande,'' he said during
perhaps a dozen question-and-answer sessions with voters here over
the last two and a half weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But that compassionate message was frequently eclipsed in the
public eye by seemingly contradictory signals that Bush might not
be willing to press his case to the point where it cost him any
votes on the right.

EPSON PRINTER, H-P SCANNER GEMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As more and more computer peripherals are released that use a
Universal Serial Bus, or USB, port, I am more and more impressed
with the technology. At this point, I've sworn off using the poky
serial and cantankerous parallel ports forever. So should you.
</P>
<P>
   As the year goes on, you'll begin seeing more computers that
don't even have these ``legacy'' connections. There are quite a few
out there already, including Dell Computer Corp.'s WebPC and Compaq
Computer Corp.'s iPaq and Presario EZ 2200. Folks who buy these
computers will need to get printers, scanners and other components
that have a USB connection. Their older devices will be useless.
</P>
<P>
   If you're thinking of going legacy-free, as it's called, here
are a pair of good choices for handling printing and scanning
chores:
</P>
<P>
   _ Epson Stylus Color 860, $250, Epson America:  &UR;  &LR; While it's not
quite as thrilling as the competition in the graphics card arena,
there's a quiet little war being fought in the printer world.
</P>
<P>
   For some time, Epson had the richest colors and impressive
speed, although it achieved this speed in a noisy fashion _ its
printers grunted and snorted like a caged bull. Hewlett-Packard's
print quality was a little better, but its consumer printers were
slower.
</P>
<P>
   Then, starting last year, HP improved its speed so its printers
can match and even outdo Epson's. And the HP printers are
whisper-quiet. The color saturation also improved so the HP printer
output looked much richer.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Epson's turn. The company has started to release its
next generation of inkjet printers. These new models are faster
than before, with gorgeous quality, and they're much quieter.
</P>
<P>
   The Stylus Color 860 is aimed at businesses, but it's an
excellent printer for general home use. It easily has the best
photo-quality output I've seen, and gets it in your hands quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The Epson has a resolution of 1,440 by 720 dots per inch, and
prints in black-and-white at 9.5 pages per minute, a figure that
roughly matched my own tests. The spec sheet also says it can
achieve seven pages per minute in photo-color mode, but I got about
half that. Still, being able to generate a large image in
photo-realistic mode at 3.5 pages per minute is pretty impressive.
</P>
<P>
   It will connect to your computer using either a USB or parallel
port connection, but you'll definitely want to use the former.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scanjet 5300c, $299, Hewlett-Packard:  &UR;  &LR; When you first take
the ScanJet 5300c out of its box, you'll probably think, ``Cool!
This must be a legal-sized scanner!''
</P>
<P>
   But no. Only the case is legal-sized; the scanning window
handles only 8{ -by-11 documents. Better have some spare desk space
available, because this model hogs some serious real estate.
</P>
<P>
   This is an update of HP's 5200 scanner series, one of its most
popular for consumer users who want high-quality scans. If you've
been laboring under a parallel port-based scanner that you bought
for $150 or less and feel the need to upgrade, this is an excellent
choice.
</P>
<P>
   The 5300c borrows an idea from Visioneer's line of One-Touch
scanners, putting buttons on the front of the device for specific
purposes. There's a button for scanning to an e-mail program, to a
fax machine, to make a printed copy and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The scanner can handle resolutions up to 1,200 dots per inch via
hardware, then can use software to achieve 9,600 dots per inch. Its
scans are beautiful, with near-perfect colors.
</P>
<P>
   HP's newest scanners have a nifty new feature that attempts to
tell the difference on a scanned page between text and images. When
passing the scan on to an optical character recognition, or OCR
program, this allows the page to keep its layout intact when being
moved into word processing software.
</P>
<P>
   The scanning process is not quite as fast as some other scanners
I've tested, particularly Visioneer's One-Touch 8600. And its
drivers are definitely not as friendly _ they load slowly, even on
a fast machine, and they don't allow for much tweaking of an image
before it's passed on to the receiving program.
</P>
<P>
   This scanner can also be used with a parallel port but, again,
you'll lose speed and reliability if you do so.

MOST HOME USERS NEEDN'T FRET ABOUT HACKER GETTING INTO FILES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Former CIA Director John Deutch has been accused of engaging
in the unsafe practice of using his unsecure home PCs, which
supposedly contained classified information he was not authorized
to download, to surf the Web. The inference here is that the
personal files of the ordinary PC user are at risk for being
viewed, stolen or corrupted when one is on the Internet. Is this
true?
</P>
<P>
   A: I have not seen details of his computer setup. But if he was
using America Online, as I've read, and had a simple dial-up
connection, he probably was safe.
</P>
<P>
   When you dial into most Internet providers or an online service
like AOL, you are assigned a number called an IP address. This
number is assigned to you from a block of them that are available
to the provider, and usually it is assigned at random. The number
you get when you sign on to the Net tonight will be different from
what it was last night.
</P>
<P>
   This makes it hard for a hacker to target you. In order to find
you, he or she would have to know the number. There are millions of
computers that dial into the Internet. This means anonymity for the
users, which keeps them from being targets.
</P>
<P>
   If a hacker were to stumble upon the right IP address _ or if
Deutch had a fixed IP address, as is the case with DSL and
cable-modem connections _ there are circumstances in which a user
is wide open. Those circumstances include having a home network and
binding File and Print Sharing to TCP/IP, the protocol used by the
Internet. A hacker who figured out the IP address could, in theory,
map your computer to look like a hard drive on his/her machine. But
again, this would be highly unlikely with a dial-up connection.
</P>
<P>
   There might be other ways to get to Deutch's computer. For
example, it's theoretically possible to create a rogue Java or
ActiveX program that could be embedded in a Web page. Someone
targeting a high-profile person like Deutch might be able to find
out his or a family member's e-mail address, then send him a link
to a booby-trapped Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Or a would-be intruder might send him or a family member an
attached program that, when run, looks harmless but plants a Trojan
horse on his machine. The hacker could then use the Trojan to
access his system.
</P>
<P>
   These risks can be avoided by simply being smart. Don't click on
links to unfamiliar Web sites sent to you by strangers. And don't
run executable programs sent as e-mail attachments, even if they
come from someone you know.
</P>
<P>
   You may want to read a column I wrote last year on DSL and cable
modem security, which deals with these issues in more detail, at
www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/tech/395376.
</P>
<P>
   You may also want to visit my Big Pipes page, which deals with
high-speed Internet access and has links to sites that deal with
security. It's at www.dwightsilverman.com/bigpipes.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Help! I have lost the toolbars I'd set up on my Windows 98 SE
desktop. When I right-click on the taskbar, the Toolbars option is
grayed out. How can I get them back?
</P>
<P>
   A: You probably have TweakUI on your system, a Control Panel
module that lets you customize Windows 95 and 98. The Windows 98
version includes a tab called IE4. Click on that tab, and find a
check called ``IE4 Enabled.'' Chances are, this is not checked.
Click to check it, then click Apply.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, Minn. _ Pat Buchanan claimed Friday that his
tenacious, state-by-state struggle for the Reform Party
presidential nomination has been boosted substantially with the
angry departure of Gov. Jesse Ventura from the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking forward to this great battle of Minnesota, a
struggle for the soul of the Reform Party,'' Buchanan declared as
he claimed a victory by default with the departure of Ventura and
the defeat of the Ventura faction in the raucous struggle for
control of the national Reform leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he has run away from a fight,'' Buchanan could not
resist adding about the governor, the fiercely competitive
professional wrestler who opposed Buchanan's switching to the
Reform line when Buchanan's long-running presidential quest as a
Republican contender flagged.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the hard winter of his third-party bid, Buchanan was a
study in contrasts as he deliberately crowed a bit in Ventura's
snow dusted home arena.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan was grateful for an apparently less obstructed path to
the nomination. But he was wary, too, that Ross Perot might yet opt
for some eleventh-hour claim on the nomination of the
anti-establishment party that has fallen on some chaotic times
since Perot first invented it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said this would be like running an Iroquois
gauntlet,'' said Buchanan said, stressing the Perot factor was only
another peril he is willing to endure and, he firmly insisted,
defeat for the nomination. ``I'm not concerned about footsteps,''
he said of Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Grinning in an interview, Buchanan described the odyssey of
courting Reform delegates in the past four months across the
political fringe of America. There was the bowling-alley convention
of the West Virginia party that he finally found in a dusty place
called Fleetwoods. There was some post-caucus fist-fighting to be
skirted after another late night exercise in democracy.
</P>
<P>
   And, always, there is the heavy lifting of organizing
50,000-signature petition drives in such difficult states as Texas,
the Perot home base. Buchanan is working to build his own
$2-million campaign machine of independent lines in 29 states to
complement the Reform parties already on the ballot in 21 states.
</P>
<P>
   As he surfaced on the trail, there was a wistfulness to Buchanan
as he studies the two main parties' slog through the presidential
primary circuit without him. ``I feel like I'm walking the
sidelines at the Superbowl on crutches and can only yell to the
guys on the field about what they're doing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He conceded his old anti-establishment thunder was being
monopolized lately by Sen. John McCain, but he predicted McCain
would eventually lose the Republican nomination. On the other hand,
he theorized that a McCain victory ``would leave the conservative
wing of the Republican party wide open'' to the Buchanan candidacy.
Buchanan dismissed speculation that McCain could eventually find a
home on the Reform line. ``I don't imagine he'd take it
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've seen this year, especially in the McCain campaign,
is the ability of a campaign to suddenly rise up and, in effect, be
winning the race for public opinion,'' he said. ``It is a volatile
situation in America,'' he said, arguing that by the fall, 80
percent of undecided voters will still ``be up for grabs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our time is in front of us,'' Buchanan declared, insisting
that by the summer nominating conventions he, not McCain, would
reign once more as the only available insurgent outlet, as he did
in 1996, with his ``pitchfork brigades.'' Republican critics of the
chronic presidential candidate note Buchanan was stuck in single
digits in pre-primary polling when he decided to jump parties. They
contend his actual quest is the spoiler's role in a November vote
split three ways.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan repeatedly emphasized that the key to his chances was
securing an equal place in this fall's televised presidential
debates by the two major party nominees. It would be difficult to
exclude him, he stressed, if he wins the Reform nomination and thus
secures the $12.6 million in federal subsidy that comes with it.
Buchanan said his lawyers, anticipating the nomination, already
were preparing to file a federal suit to secure his place in the
debate.
</P>
<P>
   In his third-party campaigning, Buchanan has been hard pressed
to win national media attention, he admitted, and so had planned
``a grand fight'' with the Ventura forces next month at the state
Reform party convention. He estimated he could have neutralized or
possibly defeated the anti-Buchanan sentiment in a full-scale
showdown that would have reminded the nation that the Buchanan
candidacy is alive and well.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan rejected Ventura's criticisms that Buchanan is an
anti-abortion ``extremist'' and ``unrealistic isolationist'' with
views anathema to the Reform Party's original principles. He looked
beyond Ventura's disenchantment with Reform politics, declaring,
``We will build a new Reform party here by the end of March and we
will have it on the ballot.''

GOLDEN DAYS REMEMBERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They should be known as one of America's greatest teams, but few
remember the excellence of what they did 40 years ago this week in
Squaw Valley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they did all the lists recently about the best teams of
the last 100 years, we were never mentioned,'' said the coach.
``Best 100, best 50, we weren't on any of them. I guess the guys
picking aren't old enough to remember.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1960 US Olympic ice hockey gold medalists are the best
``most forgotten'' team. The insult was confirmed when the lists
contained the 1980 US team that won the gold medal at Lake Placid,
N.Y., and the US women's hockey team that won gold in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, what those teams did does not compare, in this humble
reporter's opinion, with what the the 1960 team accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   That team beat Canada, then the world's greatest amateur team,
Russia, the defending champion, and Sweden, when the Swedes were
playing at home and not in the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Let's set the scene for 1960: Canada dominated the world of
hockey, but felt disgraced when Russia beat it for the gold in
1956. So Canada put together what was considered the greatest
Olympic team ever assembled, captained by a young defenseman named
Harry Sinden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had the best team, and we just knew we were going
to take the gold medal back home,'' said Sinden. ``We couldn't wait
to play the Russians, and when we did, we killed them. But then the
US knocked us off. It was an unbelievable upset. We were every bit
the overwhelming favorite to beat them in 1960 that the Russians
were to beat the US in 1980. No one thought we could be beat.''
</P>
<P>
   There were just six teams in the NHL in those days, which meant
Canada had an endless supply of outstanding players for their team.
Russia and Sweden were considered the other two great teams, with
Czechoslovakia close behind. The Americans didn't figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think we had any kind of shot to win it all,'' said
Jack Riley, who coached that team and is currently on leave from
his head coaching job at West Point. ``We had to scramble to put a
team together. We didn't have any money. Guys had to take time off
from their jobs. We went into training camp at West Point in the
fall and some of our best players didn't come. Billy and Bobby
Cleary stayed home (in Boston, starting up an insurance company)
and John Mayasich, the best player from out West, said he wouldn't
show up until we started to play in Squaw Valley. This caused us
some big problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley quickly realized in West Point sessions that his team
wasn't good enough, and that he needed the Clearys even though it
was going to cause some problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team was divided,'' Riley said. ``The guys from the West
(mostly Minnesota) wanted no part of the Clearys showing up at the
last minute to play. The guys from the East (mainly the Boston
area) knew how much they could help, but everyone was worried about
their own spot on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The US team was not that great heading to Squaw Valley, and
split. Said Riley, ``When I heard all the griping (about the
Clearys joining the squad) I told Jack Kirrane, who was captain, to
call a meeting and take a vote to disband, and if they did, I'd get
them all plane tickets and get them out of town as fast as I could.
I don't know what happened inside the meeting, but I was told that
Jack got up and told the team I wanted to take the vote to disband,
but then he added, `And the first guy who votes to disband, I'm
going to knock him on his ass.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Kirrane ruled. The team stayed together, but not in spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys from the East wouldn't talk to the guys from the
West,'' said Bobby Cleary. ``If I walked into the dining hall, and
there was only one seat left, and it was beside a guy from the
West, I wouldn't sit in it. I'd wait for another one. And it was
the same way with them. When we got to Squaw Valley and started
scrimmaging each other, Jack Riley had to call it off after 15
minutes because it became so vicious. Guys were beating up on each
other, all over the ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley had to cut a fine defenseman from Boston University named
Bob Dupuis and a player from the West named Herb Brooks, who went
on to coach the 1980 team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had Brooks's pants,'' said Bob Cleary, who stopped the talk
about him not being good enough by scoring the first goals in the
first two games he played.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had heard a lot about Mayasich (coming late from Minnesota)
but I had never seen him play,'' said Riley. ``The first game I put
him on the ice he scored three goals, and he was a defenseman. Then
the first game we got off to a good start and beat the Czechs. In
those days, you had to play everyone in the draw. When (the United
States) won in 1980, they never played Canada, and tied Sweden. We
played them all, and went undefeated. Jack McCartan was fantastic
in net. Bobby Cleary scored a lot of big goals, including the one
that beat Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Bobby Cleary, ``I've got a picture at home of me scoring
that goal, and standing there beside me watching it go in is Harry
Sinden.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought so little of our chances, they scheduled the
final game to be Russia vs. Canada, and to go on national
television,'' said Riley. ``Not us. But they did show our win over
Canada, and that was the big one.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Sinden, ``After they beat us, we could still win the goal
medal if the Czechs beat the US. But there was also a rule in the
Olympics in those days that the team that finishes highest in the
medals was the European champion. The Russians wanted the Czechs to
lose, so they brought oxygen (bottles) to the US bench to help them
win. And this was in the middle of the Cold War. Imagine, the
Russians helping America win. And they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Bobby Cleary, ``When we came back to Boston, Jack Riley had
all the Boston press meet with (Boston area players) and closed the
doors. He told them the truth. That the team was divided, almost
didn't play, and still didn't like one another. He asked them not
to print that, because he didn't want to take away from the great
victory. We never had a party when it was over. We just went our
own ways. For years, the East and West guys still didn't like each
other, but over time that has changed. We all get along well.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why the 1960 team, perhaps more so than any other, is
looking forward to March 10 and the Gold Medal Gala at the Sheraton
Boston Hotel. Three Olympic hockey teams ('60 men, '80 men, and '98
women) will be honored at a dinner sponsored by the Mass. Olympic
Committee. The proceeds will help all future Olympic athletes. For

   The Cleveland Browns were so sure they were going to sign
ex-Patriot wide receiver Shawn Jefferson to a free agent contract
last week, they sent a box of goodies (Browns hats, T-shirts, etc.)
to Jefferson, plus a surprise. Tucked at the bottom of the box was
a Tiffany bracelet for his wife, Marla. However, Jefferson, when
Atlanta gave him better than a million more dollars in bonus money
alone, decided that he could buy his own Falcons apparel and signed
in Georgia. Marla gets to keep the bracelet. The Browns will hold
the jewelry until after the fact in the future.

   There was a story out of Chicago this week after the NBA
All-Star Game that said the Celtics were for sale. It painted an
allegedly plausible scenario in which the Celtics would buy out the
contract of coach Rick Pitino to open the door to bring back Larry
Bird as general manager and head coach. The story is a great
venture in creative writing. ``The team is not for sale and we are
not buying out Rick Pitino,'' said team president Richard Pond.
``The story has no merit. There is nothing going on.'' It doesn't
figure that the Celtics would buy out Pitino. He has four years
left on his contract at $7 million a year, which means they owe him
a tidy $28 million. They fire him, they pay him all of it. That's
not the Celtic method of operation. This year Pitino wanted to get
rid of Pervis Ellison, and ownership said nyet. If the Celtics got
rid of Pitino and simply paid him off, they'd have to bring in
someone to take his place, and it would just cost more money to get
a replacement nonproducer, which doesn't make any sense. If they
didn't want to dump Ellison, for short money in comparison with
Pitino, they're not going to get rid of Rick, either.

   About 25 years ago, John Havlicek became the first player of
record to get a team to pay him interest on money he deferred from
his player contracts. When Havlicek played as long as he did, he
smartly had built a nice financial portfolio. This is what Ken
Griffey did with the Cincinnati Reds. Griffey reportedly took half
the money from his new contract, reportedly worth $116.5 million,
and deferred it for 10 years. However, the word is that the
deferred money must pay him 4 percent annually. By taking roughly
$6 million a year for 10 years, Griffey makes it easier for the
Reds to sign other players. Meanwhile, the money he set aside will
be nearly doubling, so that by the time he collects his last check
from this contract, around 2020, he will have collected $175
million in total.

   From Holy Cross athletic director Dick Regan: ``We are not

basketball ready to move to the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference
. . . Boston College football was hurt when assistant coach Al
Golden moved to Penn State, where he played his college ball.
Golden was BC's best recruiter and is highly regarded in the
coaching ranks as a potential head coach. He was offered several
jobs, including one by the New York Jets, but opted to rejoin Joe
Paterno . . . Former champion Joey Giardello is suing the owners of
the movie ``Hurricane'' about the life of boxer Rubin ``Hurricane''
Carter. Giardello allegedly felt the movie didn't tell the truth
about his fight with Carter. Giardello's name popping up brings to
mind an incident at a Celtics-Philadelphia playoff game in the
Convention Center back in the days of Wilt and Russell. Legendary
Celtic announcer Johnny Most was at courtside doing the game on
radio with Celtics public relations director Howie McHugh as his
color man. A man sitting in the first row was riding Johnny hard
since the start of the game. Just a minute or so before the first
half was over, Most turned to Howie during a commercial break and
said, ``Tell the loudmouth behind me that if he doesn't shut his
mouth, I'll come back there and deck him at halftime.'' McHugh
turned around, and turned back, without saying a word. He whispered
to Most: ``Johnny, you tell him.'' The heckler was Giardello.

COMMENTARY: NO SECOND CHANCE

   BOSTON _ Amando Baptiste was brought to this country at the age
of 9 from Cape Verde, the island republic off the west coast of
Africa. As a teen-ager in Boston, which has a community of people
from Cape Verde, he joined a gang and mixed in gang fights. He was
convicted of assault.
</P>
<P>
   He was on probation and on the run a year ago when he was
reached by a highly regarded Boston program to deal with youth
violence. A priest, the Rev. Filipe Teixeira, told him he would get
support from the program if he went straight.
</P>
<P>
   Baptiste, by then 24 years old, accepted the offer. He became a
key figure in turning other young people in the Cape Verdean
community away from violence, visiting homes and doing community
service. He stuck to strict curfew rules.
</P>
<P>
   Three days ago Baptiste was picked up and jailed by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service. Because of his past trouble
with the law, he is deportable under the 1996 Immigration Act.
</P>
<P>
   Father Teixeira deplored the arrest for deportation. ``This kid
is a star,'' he told Charles Radin of The Boston Globe. ``Everyone
admires what he has been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   There is concern in the Cape Verdean community that other young
people who have been in trouble will see this as a sign that you
lose by going straight. The Boston program, which has cut gang
violence in the city sharply, has been especially successful in
that community, among other things reducing shootings from dozens
in 1998 to near zero now.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Mayes of the Ella J. Baker settlement house, who has
played a large part in the program, called the arrest a big
mistake. ``I'm not saying the whole immigration law is wrong,'' he
said. ``But there's got to be some give and take. You have to think
about the community interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 Immigration Act does not have what Mayes called give
and take. It does not allow immigration judges to consider whether
someone has reformed and is making a social contribution. It calls
flatly for the deportation of lawfully admitted immigrants who have
been convicted of any of a long list of crimes _ ones as trivial as
pulling a woman's hair.
</P>
<P>
   Another current example, on the other side of the country, is
the case of Emma Hay of Puyallup, Wash. She came to the U.S. from
Mexico 25 years ago, at the age of 14. She has four children, all
U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 a cousin was visiting her. He got a telephone call.
Saying that his English was too bad, he asked Hay to tell the
caller that ``I can't help him today, I'll help him tomorrow.'' She
did.
</P>
<P>
   The caller, it turned out, was an undercover federal drug agent.
Hay was charged with ``use of a communication facility to
facilitate the distribution of cocaine.'' On the advice of her
lawyer, Erik Bauer, she pleaded guilty and cooperated fully. Bauer
says the prosecutor promised to recommend that she not be
imprisoned or deported. The judge sentenced her to probation.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer Hay went to Italy with her fiance to visit his
grandmother. When they flew back to New York in September, she was
arrested by INS officers. Her 1992 guilty plea, they told her, made
her deportable under the 1996 act _ which is retroactive.
</P>
<P>
   Hay was sent to an INS detention center in Louisiana, and there
she remains. Her children and her lawyer are in Washington State. A
20-year-old daughter, Vanessa, has dropped out of college to get a
job and support the family.
</P>
<P>
   Detention is automatic under the 1996 act. The place of
detention is at the discretion of the INS, and keeping Hay
thousands of miles from her family seems a particular, and
unnecessary, cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   Those two cases illustrate what seems to me a fundamental flaw
in the 1996 Immigration Act. It sets out to eliminate all judgment,
all weighing of individual factors, making deportation automatic.
But as countless cases show by now _ more than I or anyone can
describe _ that approach leads to inhumanity.
</P>
<P>
   A number of congressmen have proposed amendments to make the
1996 act more flexible. And the INS itself believes that change is
necessary. A spokesman, Bill Strassburger, said: ``We feel there
needs to be more discretion available to immigration judges when
they review cases. Waivers _ based on the crime committed, how long
they've been here, what kind of behavior they've had since,
hardship on families _ can't be considered now.''

 &HT;    Coke's market share has first dip since '93
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's not often that Pepsi can claim bragging rights
over Coke.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Coca-Cola Co. still dominates the U.S. and global
soft drink markets by a substantial margin.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, for the first time in the 1990s, Pepsi
outperformed Coca-Cola when measuring annual gains or losses in
U.S. market share by company.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, which sells five of the top 10 brands, lost 0.4
market share points last year _ its first decline since 1993,
according to Friday's release of new industry data by Beverage
Digest/Maxwell. The Atlanta-based beverage giant now controls 44.1
percent of the $58 billion carbonated soft drink market.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi, meanwhile, stayed even with its 1998 performance with a
31.4 percent share.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a corporate share standpoint, steady is better than down,
but we're into growth,'' said Pepsi spokesman Larry Jabbonsky.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi and Coca-Cola lost ground to Cadbury Schweppes' U.S.
business, which operates under the name Dr Pepper/Seven Up. The
company gained 0.5 market share points last year.
</P>
<P>
   But John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest,
emphasized that the new data need to be put into context.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers don't tell the entire story because the Coke and
Pepsi systems worked hard in 1999 to raise prices,'' Sicher said.
``That affected their market share performance and the industry's
overall growth. I believe that consumers are adjusting to the new
prices, and Coke's and Pepsi's growth, as well as the industry's,
will be stronger this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola spokeswoman Polly Howes also said the price increases
played a part in the 1999 results.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a year with a challenging price environment, we're happy
again to have five of the top 10 brands, demonstrating the appeal
of our portfolio of products,'' Howes said. ``In addition, as we
look at our total beverage picture, we have about a 20 percent
growth rate in noncarbonated case sales, which is not reflected in
these carbonated soft drink numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the top 10 carbonated brands, Pepsi's Mountain Dew was the
fastest growing last year. Its share rose 0.4 points to capture
fourth place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to have Dew on our side,'' Jabbonsky said. ``The
key is to get the rest of our soft drink engines cranked up.''
</P>
<P>
   Mountain Dew posted double the 0.2 market share gain of Dr
Pepper and Coca-Cola's Sprite.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the cola segment of the industry contracted last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Coke Classic, the nation's top selling brand, lost 0.3 market
share points. Pepsi-Cola fell 0.4 points, but remains a solid No.
2.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 3 brand, Diet Coke, also lost ground, falling 0.1
points, while Diet Pepsi, the No. 7 brand, fell 0.3 points.

SONIC ESCAPES FRANKIE'S SHADOW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG HASSELL 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the folks at Sonic Corp. set out to gauge public opinion
about their company back in 1995, they were a little surprised and
chagrined at the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we asked people, `What do you think of when you think of
Sonic?' the overwhelming majority said, `Frankie Avalon,' because
he'd done our advertising for six years,'' said Sonic CEO Cliff
Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   There was one significant problem with that response. Frankie
Avalon hadn't worked for the company in two years. Secondly,
customers weren't saying anything about the business or its core
characteristics as America's Drive-In. The Oklahoma-based company
had inadvertently aligned itself so closely with its spokesman that
it hadn't gained an identity to call its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankie was everything, but in the long run, we saw that it
didn't help us,'' Hudson said.
</P>
<P>
   The company realized it had to get out of Frankie's shadow. It
had to push harder at establishing its own identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus used to be business development _ opening new
stores,'' Hudson said. ``These days we look at our business as a
brand.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
EMPHASIZING WHAT'S DIFFERENT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Step one was creating a new type of advertising that emphasized
what was different about Sonic. The obvious place to begin was the
car hop, a character missing from rivals McDonald's and Burger
King.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will always see the car hop in every one of our
commercials,'' Hudson vowed.
</P>
<P>
   The new marketing also revolves around menu items not found at
the burger giants. The commercials flog things like hot dogs, tater
tots and cherry limeades.
</P>
<P>
   Sonic is still doing the public surveys, calling 25,000 people
every year to participate in something called SonicTrack. Luckily,
Frankie Avalon doesn't come up much anymore. What people do mention
regularly is the carhops, the hot dogs, the tater tots and the
cherry limeades _ precisely the message Sonic has been trying to
hammer home for five years now.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a page from Dairy Queen, Sonic is now promoting a line of
ice cream treats. The idea is to use desserts to attract more sales
during slow times of the day. Whereas Sonic used to be busy at
lunch and dinner, adding the snack business has breathed more life
into Sonic's afternoons and late evenings, Hudson said.
</P>
<P>
   Another marketing theme Sonic is trying to reinforce is the
redesign of its restaurants. Adopting a look it calls retro-future,
Sonic has converted most of its locations to a design that's
something of a cross between ``The Jetsons'' and ``American
Graffiti.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston is the first big market that we converted to the new
look,'' Hudson said. ``It was met with tremendous success here and
provided the momentum for us to roll it out nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
AD SPENDING UP 20% &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to altering its message, Sonic is spending more to
get the word out. Marketing expenditures increased 20 percent to
about $54 million last year. It appears that the fruit of Sonic's
branding is sweet and abundant.
</P>
<P>
   Total revenues for last year rose 18 percent to $257.6 million.
Net income jumped 24 percent to $27.4 million. Not all of that can
be attributed to marketing efforts, obviously. However, Hudson
believes the branding strategy is a major piece of the puzzle. It
is a view shared by industry analysts who track Sonic's progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a great company and they are headed in the right
direction. Their success speaks for itself,'' said analyst Mark
Sheridan of Johnson Rice. ``The focus under Cliff Hudson has been
to build up the brand, and that has been very important to their
success.''
</P>
<P>
   By carving a unique niche, Sonic avoided the fate of some other
small fry in the burger business. Some small chains such as Rally's
and Checkers marketed themselves around the concept of low prices,
basically making themselves a commodity instead of a brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's caught on to
their strategy, they cut prices and knocked them out,'' Hudson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all its success, there remain naysayers who still
don't understand Sonic spending millions on something as fuzzy as
brand building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still get people who ask me, `How can you focus on the brand
instead of the bottom line?''' Hudson said. ``Give me a break.
People forget what made the bottom line healthy in the first place.
The more we focus on our brand, the more successful we have been.''

AWAITING THE NEW RICH: ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By HILARY ROSENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ric C. Calvillo spent most of his 20s working 80-hour weeks at
three companies, two of which he started himself. In August 1998,
when he was 29, Calvillo sold the Conley Corp., the software
company of which he was the founder and a co-owner, for about $50
million to the EMC Corp., the data storage giant of Hopkinton,
Mass., where he continues to work as a division manager.
</P>
<P>
   Calvillo found himself with a sizable fortune _ he won't say how
sizable _ and portfolios of stocks and municipal bonds.
</P>
<P>
   But Calvillo has also put money elsewhere _ into three hedge
funds, two venture capital funds and a venture capital ``fund of
funds.'' The industry term for such vehicles _ as well as those
that invest in leveraged buyouts _ is ``alternative investment''
funds. And these days, affluent investors can choose among a
growing array of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The supply of these types of products has accelerated, and
there is more variety and more flexibility on how they are
offered,'' says William R. White, a consultant at Spectrem Group, a
market research firm based in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Today's alternative investments represent a democratization,
albeit a limited one, of high finance. Many of the new products are
versions of investments that have long been available to
institutions and the extremely wealthy. But with minimums of up to
$10 million, those investments were never within reach of the
run-of-the-mill multimillionaire, especially because a person
investing that kind of money would want a fair amount of
diversification.
</P>
<P>
   Some newer products carry minimums that are as low as $250,000 _
making them affordable to more people, including many beneficiaries
of the long bull market in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   And many funds divide their assets among several managers,
assuring more diversification.
</P>
<P>
   The number of companies selling these more accessible funds has
also grown sharply, although investors may have to ask for them
specifically. They include Wall Street brokerage firms, commercial
banks, private banks, discount brokers and asset management firms.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the potentially high returns, alternative investment
funds can be volatile. Consider Tiger Management LLC, a hedge fund
managed by Julian Robertson, the value investor. It lost about 19
percent last year. But if you can stomach the ride, such funds can
be lucrative over the long term. Since the fund was started in 1980
it has returned 27 percent, annualized, after fees.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the risks, experts often advise investors to put only
a relatively small portion of their total net worth into hedge
funds, and to diversify. Venture capital and buyout funds are also
volatile; moreover, they can lock up investors' money for as long
as 10 years, whereas hedge funds usually allow withdrawals at the
end of a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the alternative investment, fees can be high. But
wealthy investors can afford them _ and generally aren't likely to
have their needs met by, say, an index fund, regardless of the cost
advantage. And they are willing to pay for top-notch money
management skill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds have been growing in popularity among the rich for
several years. Assets under management were an estimated $400
billion in 1998, versus just $50 billion in 1990, according to
Tremont Advisers, a research firm in Rye, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the lure of hedge funds is that they do not move
in line with the stock market, so they can be a good means of
diversification.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hedge funds offer a broad range of strategies, some low risk
and others high risk, and you can get absolute return not
correlated to the market,'' said Edward J. Orazem, managing
director of Citi Trust Services at Citicorp's Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   MAR/Hedge, a unit of Managed Account Reports Inc., estimates
that there are 3,000 hedge funds worldwide, managed by 2,000
different firms. The hedge-fund universe includes many wide-ranging
categories, including global, emerging markets, arbitrage and
short-selling.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, returns vary enormously. Hedge funds specializing
in established global markets had a median 10-year annualized
return of 19.5 percent through 1999, net of fees, compared with
minus 0.2 percent for short-selling funds.
</P>
<P>
   Such differences help explain why some wealthy investors prefer
funds of funds, vehicles that invest in multiple hedge funds,
usually with different strategies. Tremont now tracks 262 such
funds of hedge funds, up from just 31 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Minimum investments for such vehicles are often lower than for
single-manager funds, because the sponsor pools the money of many
investors to meet the high minimums of the underlying funds.
Typical are the funds of funds offered by Donaldson Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette; they require minimums of $250,000 to $500,000, compared
with $3 million to $5 million minimums for the underlying funds.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge-fund fees typically include both a 1 percent annual
management fee and a performance, or incentive, fee of 20 percent
of profits. But you'll pay more for funds of funds: though they
often charge just a small incentive fee of 0.25 percent or so, that
is usually on top of the regular fees that go to pay the underlying
managers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Private equity is another popular alternative-investment flavor.
The category includes venture capital and leveraged buyout funds as
well as mezzanine funds, which invest in the debt of established
companies. The pitch is not just that these funds let you diversify
out of publicly traded stocks, but that they also let you in on the
ground floor of the next new thing (in the case of the venture
funds), or let you play Henry Kravis (in the case of leveraged
buyout and mezzanine funds).
</P>
<P>
   Private equity funds of funds have been especially in demand.
Like hedge funds of funds, they require lower minimum investments
than the underlying partnerships: $250,000 at Independence Holdings
Partners of New York, which runs buyout funds, and $500,000 to $1
million at investment banking firms. The underlying venture funds
require at least $1 million; the underlying buyout funds require at
least $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Private equity funds of funds raised $14.9 billion in 1999,
according to Asset Alternatives, a research firm in Wellesley,
Mass.; as recently as 1991, there were no such offerings.
Individuals account for about one-fourth of the money, up from
virtually nothing five years ago. The remainder is from
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The assets in private equity funds of funds surged after
mid-1997 because of a change in rules covering limited partnerships
_ the structure of all hedge and private equity funds. Previously,
partnerships of any kind that wanted to avoid registering with the
Securities and Exchange Commission could raise money from only 99
so-called accredited investors, who had to have at least $1 million
in investible assets.
</P>
<P>
   But in April 1997, the rules were changed to let them raise
money from 499 so-called qualified purchasers, who must have a
minimum total net worth of $5 million. Most new funds of funds are
intended for the latter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LEVERAGED BUYOUT FUNDS Eighty-two leveraged buyout funds were
started in 1999 alone, according to Buyouts, a newsletter based in
New York. Those few funds that admit individual investors usually
do so only for a few friends and associates of the funds' general
partner.
</P>
<P>
   Leveraged buyouts are not making the same kind of headlines that
they did 10 years ago, but the returns of funds that invest in them
have been attractive. Cambridge Associates, a research firm,
reports that its United States private equity index, a good proxy
for buyout fund results, returned 23.9 percent, annualized, for the
five years ended last Sept. 30, after fees, expenses and the
general partner's share.
</P>
<P>
   Investment banks sponsor leveraged buyout funds of funds in two
varieties: so-called feeder funds, which invest in a single
investment manager, or multiple-manager buyout funds. Donaldson
Lufkin has raised feeder funds for buyout artists like the Thomas
H. Lee Company, Apollo Advisors, Hicks Muse Tate &AMP; Furst and
Leonard Green Capital.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts warn that brochures for leverage buyout fund
offerings may refer to ``target'' returns that are too optimistic,
because they are based on past performance. Because of the
increasing competition in the buyout arena in the last few years,
future returns could be hurt.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDS This is the hottest subset of private
equity because of its recent eye-popping returns. ``All of these
people want to invest in the next Yahoo before it goes public,''
said Donna Curry Hessell, director of private advisory services at
Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   According to Cambridge Associates, the annualized return of its
United States venture funds index was 51.6 percent for the five
years through Sept. 30, after fees, expenses and the general
partner's share.
</P>
<P>
   Some investment banks offer funds of funds in this area, too,
including multimanager funds that mix venture capital and buyout
managers. Merrill Lynch now offers one private equity fund or fund
of funds each quarter: the funds of funds have equal amounts of
leveraged buyout and venture capital vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Investment banks like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
and UBS that do their own venture capital and mezzanine debt deals
often allow their private clients to invest with them. And some
institutional money managers allow individuals into venture capital
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capital firms are also welcoming more entrepreneurs with
business connections; such investors can help them generate deals.
Often, the firms let them participate in so-called side funds,
which invest alongside the institutional funds in the same deals.
</P>
<P>
   The side funds include up to 100 investors who contribute
$50,000 to $500,000 each. Until 1999, side funds were no larger
than 5 percent to 10 percent of the institutional fund. Now, some
venture capitalists are expanding the individuals' allotment to 25
percent or more.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Consumer Price Index, the nation's best-known inflation
measure, edged up only 0.2 percent in January _ the fourth
consecutive mild increase _ undercutting numerous forecasts that
the booming economy is creating shortages that must inevitably show
up in more rapidly rising prices.
</P>
<P>
   Apparel and cars helped to keep inflation in check in January.
Prices fell in both categories, the Bureau of Labor Statistics
reported Friday, with apparel prices dropping 1.1 percent, the
biggest one-month decline since February 1989. Energy prices
jumped, of course, rising by 1 percent, but that was a smaller
increase than many analysts had expected given the steeply rising
cost of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than petroleum-based energy _ mainly gasoline and
heating oil _ there has been no steady price acceleration in any
sector of the economy,'' said Patrick Jackman, a senior economist
at the bureau's Consumer Price division.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the Commerce Department reported Friday that the
nation's trade deficit had narrowed to $25.5 billion in December
from $27.1 billion in November, largely because exports jumped. The
export rise suggested that the economy had expanded more rapidly in
the fourth quarter than the government had originally thought. The
gross domestic product may have grown at a 6 percent annual rate,
some analysts said, rather than the 5.8 percent estimate announced
last month by the Commerce Department. A revision of this estimate
is to be published next Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Several Wall Street economists reacted to the inflation report
with more alarm than Jackman, seeing in the details signs of
accelerating inflation. Since last October, the Consumer Price
Index has risen each month at the same mild 0.2 percent, and over
the previous 12 months the rise was only 2.6 or 2.7 percent. The
annual rise is much less when two elements that fluctuate
considerably _ food and energy _ are excluded. Then the increase in
``core inflation'' was 2.1 percent in October and November, falling
to 1.9 percent in the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   But service sector prices and housing costs have edged up after
falling during the summer and fall, and several economists pointed
this out, among them Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at High
Frequency Economics, a Wall Street firm. ``There are some things in
the CPI report that I really do not like,'' he said. ``The overall
numbers are still mild, but there are bits and pieces that suggest
an upward push.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest CPI report was issued the day after Alan Greenspan,
the chairman of the Federal Reserve, told Congress that the demand
for goods and services has been rising faster than the supply, a
condition that cannot continue indefinitely. The stock market has
played a big role in generating so much consumption, he said, and
he suggested that the Fed would push up rates to slow the economy,
and the market, until supply and demand were once again in balance.
``Real long-term rates will at some point be high enough to finally
balance demand with supply,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Real interest rates have already risen steeply in the last year.
Real rates are what people pay for a car loan or a mortgage, for
example, minus the inflation rate. The reasoning is that inflation
offsets the cost of a loan because the value of the home purchased
rises with inflation, and so does the debtor's income, which means
that loan payments become a smaller percentage of the person's
income.
</P>
<P>
   Real rates, by that standard, are up a steep 1 percentage point
in less than a year. The Fed has raised loan rates by that much, to
nearly 6 percent, while the core annual inflation rate has remained
at 2 percent. Greenspan's congressional testimony suggested that
the Fed's policy-makers plan another rate increase on March 21,
their next meeting. The CPI report for February will be published
four days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   That next report is likely to show higher gasoline and heating
oil prices, and higher cigarette prices, just on the basis of price
increases since late January, Jackman and other economists said.
</P>
<P>
   The January report showed the same scattered mix of higher and
lower prices that has characterized the monthly reports since last
summer. New and used car prices, for example, fell mainly because
of a $500 ``loyalty'' rebate offered by General Motors, Jackman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Education costs jumped in January primarily because encyclopedia
companies eliminated a price discount that drew buyers in December.
Apparel prices almost always drop sharply in the weeks after
Christmas, although last month's decline was greater than usual.
``These are your post-holiday sales,'' Jackman said.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette prices rose a steep 1.7 percent, partly because of
recently imposed tax increases. Airline fares, however, fell in
January despite temporary surcharges to cover rising fuel prices.
Super-saver discount fares more than offset the surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are looking for trouble, you can always find items that
suggest that inflation is rebounding,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief
economist at Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown. ``But inflation is defined
as a broad increase in prices, and that has not happened.''

 &HT;    Victims urged to watch for scams
 &HT;    By Christopher Quinn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They drift in on disasters like vultures, looking to
prey on victims and dine on federal disaster dollars or insurance
money.
</P>
<P>
   Scam artists, price gougers, bogus charity solicitors and fake
victims invariably show up in places like tornado-ravaged South
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to understand, when you talk about disasters, you
have two things that happen,'' said Dell Kirkland, assistant
special agent in charge of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation's
office in Albany. ``You have FEMA (Federal Emergency Management
Agency) funds, which is money, and you have insurance, which is
money. ... It's like calling hogs to a trough.''
</P>
<P>
   Many residents are in need of housing or repairs after last
week's tornadoes. More than 450 homes were destroyed or damaged in
Mitchell, Grady, Colquitt and Tift counties. On Friday, the federal
government delivered the first batch of temporary homes to Camilla.
</P>
<P>
   More are expected Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when many storm victims are most vulnerable,
fly-by-night repairmen drive up and offer to cut up fallen trees or
fix a roof. They get as much money up front as possible, then
disappear, Kirkland said.
</P>
<P>
   Others pose as victims, trying to get charity, and others pose
as collectors for charities. They take up donations, then skip out
with the change jingling in their own pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officers are in the area or are on their way to
cut the thieves off. Agents from the GBI will be fanning out
through the area beginning Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Simms, interim director of investigations with the state
secretary of state's office, has two agents in the area already.
The secretary of state licenses workers for a number of trades,
including electricians, plumbers and phone linemen.
</P>
<P>
   Simms said his agents are looking for unlicensed workers and
warning tornado victims to ask for identification and proof of
licensing before hiring someone.
</P>
<P>
   Two or three officers from the Governor's Office of Consumer
Affairs will arrive today to warn hotels and businesses about price
gouging and educate and assist law enforcement, said Barry Reid,
the office's administrator.
</P>
<P>
   He had heard no complaints by Friday, but said it usually takes
a week or more before scams begin.
</P>
<P>
   Cities such as Camilla have the advantage of being small
communities. The people know local builders or repairmen.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland cautioned, however, that living in a small town is no
guarantee of protection. In the face of disaster and the rush to
get life back to normal, people sometimes make hasty or poor
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The key to stopping rip-offs is education and prevention, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The object is to keep the victims from being victims twice,''
he said.

WINTER STORM STRANDS AIR TRAVELERS, MAKES DRIVING DIFFICULT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Mich., Wis., Neb., Iowa, Pa., Md., N.J., Ark.)  (rk) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ A winter storm swept the Midwest and parts of the East
Friday, snarling traffic, canceling flights and closing schools,
with more than 10 inches of snow blanketing some regions.
</P>
<P>
   With visibility obscured, nearly 300 flights were canceled at
O'Hare International Airport and Midway Airport here, stranding
thousands of travelers. More than 200 flights were also canceled in
Detroit, and airports throughout the country saw delays caused by
the ripple effect of the cancellations. Adding to the woes of air
travelers, a computer problem forced America West Airlines to
cancel 128 flights nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Schools throughout the Midwest and parts of the East were
closed, giving students an early jump on the Presidents' Day
weekend, and snowmen soon sprung up in many front yards.
</P>
<P>
   About six inches of snow had fallen in Chicago by Friday
evening, slowing traffic to a crawl. The Illinois state police,
overwhelmed by a flurry of accident reports, were telling motorists
involved in crashes without injuries to simply exchange information
with the other driver and call the police later.
</P>
<P>
   After what has been a relatively tame winter, the storm brought
a reminder that February can pack a wicked punch.
</P>
<P>
   Michael John, a spokesman for the Wisconsin Electric and Power
Co., who recently moved to Wisconsin, said he was wondering when
the infamous winter weather would arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been so mild I'm not sure I can claim to have spent a
winter in Wisconsin yet,'' John said.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln McDonald, a spokesman for the Illinois state police,
also said the storm had brought an end to a comparatively easy
winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been very lucky so far this year,'' McDonald said. ``But
today we've got some classic nasty Chicago weather. It isn't
anything we haven't seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Milwaukee declared a snow emergency, where the
storm temporarily knocked out power at the Mayfair Mall. A shopper
was trapped in an elevator for 10 minutes. In Detroit, Mayor Dennis
Archer pledged that, for the first time in decades, all
neighborhood streets would be plowed.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 inches of snow fell on parts of Nebraska, Iowa and
Wisconsin, and some businesses closed for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Besides school closings in much of the Upper Midwest, classes
were canceled in parts of Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey and
the District of Columbia. In parts of the East wet snow and sleet
made driving treacherous.
</P>
<P>
   The same low pressure system that drove the snowstorm sent
severe thunderstorms through central Arkansas and spawned at least
one tornado. A few businesses and homes were damaged in Benton, a
city of 18,000 people southwest of Little Rock, but no injuries
were reported, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Midwest expected a respite on Saturday, with forecasts for
sunshine and high temperatures in the 30s.
</P>
<P>
   Snow crews had ample warning of the storm. Some schools in New
Jersey dismissed students early, even before the snow fell, based
on the weather reports.
</P>
<P>
   And snowplow drivers in many places had the chance to be on the
road even before the flakes hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got snow, we've got ice,'' said Fran Ward, a spokesman
for the Maryland State Highway Association. ``We've got plenty of
salt.''
</P>
<P>
   But the storm brought cheers to businesses who run winter
recreation activities, as well as other snow fans who might have
felt cheated during the relatively dry, mild winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's going to be cold, it might as well snow, right?'' said
Greg Mann, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in
Michigan. ``I think a lot of people have that sentiment, and we're
a little behind on snow as it is.''

 &HT;    Waltrip's final lap starts slow
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Given the way it has begun, the title for
Darrell Waltrip's farewell to Winston Cup driving could use a
little retooling.
</P>
<P>
   But then, neither ``Starting One Step Ahead of the Tow Truck
Tour'' nor ``Sucking Hind Cylinder Tour'' befits an 84-time
champion.
</P>
<P>
   So, Waltrip's ``Victory Tour'' commences as is, despite the
reality of his situation. He will start 43rd in Sunday's Daytona
500, only because there's no place farther back to put him. We find
Waltrip at the beginning of his 28th and final season pretty much
where we left him. Wandering racing's slipstream.
</P>
<P>
   At least this is a familiar predicament. He was given the final
starting spot in the preceding two Daytona 500s, compliments of a
past champion's provisional. He was in the last row at the start of
seven of his 27 races last year, a season that, Waltrip says,
``hurt my pride.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody's got to start 43rd,'' Waltrip said Friday, relying
on the clever sense of resignation that has replaced a fierce
competitive spirit.
</P>
<P>
   If Waltrip is struck by the irony of kicking off a farewell
victory tour in dead last _ with winning such a remote prospect _
he isn't showing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel bad about that at all,'' he said. ``There's times
I had to take a provisional when I didn't even need to be in the
race, because my car wasn't that good. But this ain't one of them.
I feel good about the car. I feel good about our chances.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last go-round, Waltrip clings to the hope that his
current Hass/Carter Ford _ most importantly, powered by a Robert
Yates engine _ is a whole bunch more reliable than some of the
other Model T's he has been in lately. His inability to coexist
with a stable program has been a serious flaw.
</P>
<P>
   He has felt no flood of sentiment in preparing for his last
Daytona 500. In concentrating on preparation, Waltrip is walling
off the emotions of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might be down here crying next year a little bit (as a
noncompetitor), but I feel pretty good right now,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He brings memories of a first Daytona 500 in 1973, when his crew
slept in their cars and subsisted on ``slick meat sandwiches.''
There was a serious concussion suffered in the 1983 race, and the
fractured left leg seven years later during Daytona 500 practice.
He finally won the thing in 1989, on his 17th try. He and the race
``have a love-hate relationship,'' he said. ``The injuries stick
out as much as the good finishes.''
</P>
<P>
   If Waltrip, who soon turns 53, misplaced his edge somewhere
along the line, who could blame him? In this sport, that could be
considered the onset of sanity. Which doesn't explain why he has
held on through so many fruitless campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   An entire generation of upcoming Winston Cup fans don't
recognize the third all-time Winston Cup winner. Not only has
Waltrip not won in seven years, he has had only 39 top-10 finishes
in the 214 races over that span. He bears faint resemblance to the
brash, indomitable driver who had back-to-back 12-win seasons, in
1981 and '82.
</P>
<P>
   He tells a story about watching the Kevin Costner baseball
vehicle ``The Love of the Game,'' about an over-the-hill pitcher.
``As I watched it, I thought, `That's me,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The realization arrived as slowly as if it were a message in a
bottle. This is not the venue for retirement parties. Witness
Geoffrey Bodine's fiery, horrific wreck during Friday's truck race
at Daytona. Racing provides the most pointed warnings.

ILLINOIS GOVERNOR HOPES TO FIX A `BROKEN' JUSTICE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Ill. _ Sitting in a chair facing a bronze statue of
Abraham Lincoln, Gov. George Ryan shuddered as he recalled ``the
most anguishing period of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan had been asked to grant a stay of execution last year for a
man convicted of a brutal slaying and mutilation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was miserable, absolutely miserable,'' said Ryan, 65, a
stocky former high school linebacker with a florid complexion and a
shock of white hair. ``The idea that I had the power to decide
whether a man should live or die. It was awful.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Ryan, a supporter of the death penalty, denied the
stay, and the man was executed. The governor hoped he would never
be faced with such a decision again.
</P>
<P>
   But a little over a month ago, the state attorney general, Jim
Ryan, told the governor that another execution would soon be
scheduled in Illinois, a state that has seen 13 men wrongfully
convicted and sent to death row since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   With more details surfacing about flaws in the justice system
that led to the wrongful convictions, Ryan took a step that made
national headlines and rekindled the roiling debate in his state
over capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to put a stop to this,'' the governor told the
attorney general. ``The system is broken. It's time we take a look
and see what's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Ryan declared a halt to executions in
Illinois, making him the first governor to impose such a
moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   While Ryan said he acted out of conscience, some of his critics
wondered at the timing of the announcement, coming in the middle of
a Federal investigation into a scandal that had tarnished his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The latest in a long line of moderate Republican governors of
Illinois, Ryan has been overshadowed by Midwestern governors with
more activist agendas, like Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin and John
Engler of Michigan. But the moratorium has changed that.
</P>
<P>
   It has also highlighted Ryan's willingness to split with
conservative Republicans here, who have accused him of governing as
a liberal.
</P>
<P>
   He has pushed for strong gun control and broader protection for
gay people. He raised taxes on alcohol and increased fees on
driver's licenses, in part, to pay for a $12 billion public works
program that was hailed by trade unions.
</P>
<P>
   He maintains a close working relationship with Mayor Richard M.
Daley of Chicago, a Democrat, and has worked on some measures with
the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, a Democrat who is anathema to many
conservatives. He has also met with Fidel Castro and called for
lifting the trade embargo on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that ``conservatives have raised hell'' about some
of his moves, Ryan said he has tried to base his decisions on
fairness, not partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting rights for gays, he said, was ``just a matter of
common sense,'' not a Democratic or Republican position. ``Why
would anyone want to discriminate?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   On gun control: ``People have good reason to be afraid of
guns.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Cuba embargo: ``It's a humanitarian issue.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his relationship with Daley, a stark departure from the
traditional political rivalry in Illinois between the mayor of
Chicago and the governor, Ryan said it was simply good governance.
``If I have an idea I want to bounce off the mayor, I pick up the
phone and call him,'' he said. ``And he does the same.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of the farm-and-factory town of Kankakee, Ryan is a
druggist's son. After a stint in the Army in Korea, he enrolled at
Ferris State College in Big Rapids, Mich., where he studied
pharmacy. He married Lura Lynn Lowe in 1956 and joined the family
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had this soda and lunch fountain, and during the morning,
people would come in to drink coffee, shoot the breeze and complain
about the government,'' Ryan recalled. ``Finally I said, `Somebody
ought to run for office and do something about things.'''
</P>
<P>
   He worked to elect his brother, Thomas Jr., mayor of Kankakee in
1965. A year later, George Ryan was appointed to the Kankakee
County Board.
</P>
<P>
   In nearly 35 years as a politician, Ryan has never lost an
election. He served 10 years in the Illinois legislature, won
election twice as lieutenant governor and then served two terms as
the secretary of state, before his successful bid for governor in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   While the moratorium on the death penalty has drawn most of the
attention outside of Illinois, inside the state just as much has
been focused on a growing scandal involving the secretary of
state's office during Ryan's tenure. Some 17 people have pleaded
guilty to taking bribes, and a top aide to Ryan has been indicted.
Some of the money found its way to Ryan's campaign for governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's embarrassing,'' Ryan said. ``It happened on my watch and
I've apologized for it.'' Critics have said that Ryan should have
known about the wrongdoing, and a federal investigation is
continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan has angered some conservatives by reversing his Republican
predecessor's ban on alcohol at the governor's mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drink a beer once in a while,'' said Ryan, the father of six
grown children, including triplet girls.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said his political hero was Richard Ogilvie, a Republican
governor who put through a state income tax, a move that cost him
the next election. To Ryan, it was an act of courage that he said
he has tried to emulate.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of his critics, he said, ``I'd like to see those people
sit in that chair and make the decisions I have to make.''

U.S. PLEASED AFTER WEEK OF TALKS WITH CHINA  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ After two days of meetings with senior Chinese
officials, a U.S. government delegation left Beijing on a positive
note Friday, with members characterizing the talks as a further
effort at getting the bilateral ``relationship back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Relations soured after NATO war planes bombed the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade last May, in what the United States has
insisted was an accident. Beijing reacted to the bombing by
suspending talks with the United States on military issues, arms
proliferation and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   This week's visit, by a delegation that included Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and top officials from the State
Department, Defense Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was
part of the resumption of the dialogue on security. But the
meetings came just a month before Taiwan's presidential elections,
and seemed in part an effort to avoid the ugly confrontations that
preceded the last Taiwanese presidential election, in 1996. At that
time, China lobbed missiles into the waters near Taiwan and U.S.
aircraft carriers sailed into the region in response.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said that this week they told their Chinese
counterparts that they thought ``what happened in 1996 was
counterproductive,'' although they said that they were ``unclear''
if the Chinese shared that view.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said we should regard the period ahead as a period of
opportunity but also a period by definition of some uncertainty,
that requires the greatest possible degree of restraint, caution
and prudence on everybody's part,'' one U.S. official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   That such cordial meetings could take place now is considered an
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Prueher, the recently arrived U.S. ambassador to China
who was commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet in 1996, has complained
that he had no one in the Chinese military he could confer with as
his ships were moving towards Taiwan. At a recent news conference
in Beijing, he advocated more ``communication between military
leaders so there are not miscalculations.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Taiwan, this week's meetings, which included a
five-hour session with Deputy Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi, covered
a broad array of foreign policy issues including North Korea,
tensions between India and Pakistan and relations with Russia.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Americans also met with Deputy Prime Minister Qian Qichen
and Lt. Gen. Xiong Guangkai, deputy chief of the People's
Liberation Army's general staff and its central figure for foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese took the opportunity to express their continuing
displeasure with U.S. military assistance to Taiwan and the
national and regional missile defense systems currently under
study. The Chinese worry that these might be used against them in
any conflict with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, U.S. officials said they expressed objections to the
Chinese missile build-up in Fujian, the Chinese province closest to
Taiwan. They said they also reminded the Chinese that militles to Taiwan were a reaction to threats from China.
</P>
<P>
   The United States sells arms to Taiwan ``for defensive purposes,
depending on its needs. And that doesn't exist in a vacuum,'' a
U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, top Chinese officials, including Qian, have
restated their longstanding threat to use military force if Taiwan
makes any formal moves towards independence.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these warnings, the mood on the mainland in the run-up
to the Taiwanese elections this time is far calmer than it was four
years ago, when large stretches of the Chinese coast across from
Taiwan were turned into a military zone, and civilian airports
there were closed to commercial traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. officials said the Chinese have been studying Taiwanese
politics closely and seemed to understand the complexities of the
election, in which ambiguity has become a virtue when it comes to
relations with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   All three of Taiwan's leading presidential candidates have
declared that they will not pursue independence from the mainland,
which has considered Taiwan a breakaway province since Chiang
Kai-shek's Nationalist forces retreated there after their 1949
defeat by the Communists. But President Lee Teng-hui, who is not
running for re-election, infuriated China's leaders last year by
insisting that Taiwan's talks with China should be conducted on a
``state-to-state'' basis.

<P>
   The FTSE 100 stock index staged a nice rally last week, but so
far this year things have generally not been so merry in the City
of London.
</P>
<P>
   Markets through much of Europe are up, in some cases fairly
strongly. But by the end of last week, British stocks were down 11
percent.
</P>
<P>
   To the untutored eye, the divergence does not make sense. For
example, how can the British stock market, at a time of close to
full employment, be underperforming the German market, where the
unemployment rate recently rose to 11 percent?
</P>
<P>
   Plum Shipton, European equity strategist at Merrill Lynch, took
some time last week to talk about the problems for British stocks
amid the bright picture for European equities. Following are
excerpts from the conversation: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The slide in the British market has been kind of quiet. But
it certainly has been pronounced. What has caused it? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There are a couple of reasons, one cyclical, the other
technical.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Bank of England has been raising interest rates more
proactively than central banks in the rest of Europe, and growth in
Britain has pretty much peaked. Major economies in Europe are still
in the sweet spot.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the British market suffers from a lack of growth stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Of the top 300 European growth stocks, only two British
companies, Vodafone AirTouch and Misys, a software company, are in
the top 20. Given the size of the British market, that number
should be seven. And 15 of the worst 20 growth stocks happen to be
British companies. We don't have the Nokias of the world, and there
is a mania for technology and telecom stocks. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The technical problem, as I understand it, involves a
portfolio imbalance involving Vodafone shares among British fund
managers. Can you explain that?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The merger has created a weightings issue.
</P>
<P>
   Before the deal was announced, U.K.fund managers were
underweight the stock relative to its position in the FTSE index.
Because of the much greater size of the company after the merger,
that underweighting has become even more pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   To restore Vodaphone to its proper weighting, between 20 billion
pounds and 30 billion pounds need to be reallocated out of other
stocks and into Vodafone once all Mannesmann shareholders have
tendered their stock. ...
</P>
<P>
   That is forcing U.K. managers to sell shares in other issues.
...
</P>
<P>
   A similar situation arose in the wake of the BP-Amoco merger. In
that instance, it took seven or eight months for the reallocation
to be completed. In this case, it could take longer because the
deal is so much bigger.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Once the technical problem is resolved, is the market likely
to right itself? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The cyclical question will still be hanging over the U.K.
market.
</P>
<P>
   We don't think we will have a recession, but a soft landing in
Britain. And we are probably quite close to a peak in short-term
interest rates, which the Bank of England has raised four times
since September, to 6.25 percent currently.
</P>
<P>
   In order for the British market to improve, we need to see a
stabilization of the relative growth scenarios with Continental
Europe. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Let's talk about the rest of Europe for a minute. You prefer
those markets to Britain's, right? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. We have been underweight the U.K., and remain so at the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Going forward, we are still looking for some positive surprises
out of Germany. The combination of the corporate tax rate reform
and the lowering on capital gains taxes as well as the
Vodafone-Mannesmann deal have raised expectations. That is
particularly true of the Vodafone deal. No one would have thought a
hostile deal like that would have happened between European
companies, let alone a fight involving a German company. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What about other European markets? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Peripheral markets like Finland, Ireland and the Netherlands
are doing quite well. They have strong growth rates and their
markets have been skewed by hot technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch market is full of things like Philips and ASM
Lithography, a semiconductor company. We also like the oil sector,
and Royal Dutch/Shell is attractive. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. To bring this full circle, are there stocks in the British
market you are looking at? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We would be focusing on the oils, some bank stocks, which are
discounting more than enough bad news, and certain defensive
stocks, like utilities, brewers and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Imperial Tobacco and Scottish &AMP; Newcastle, a brewer, are two
value defensive names we would recommend.

SITE OF FIRST OIL WELL THAT LAUNCHED TEXAS' OIL BOOM FINALLY FOUND 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: For release Sunday, Feb. 20) 
 
By JAMES KIMBERLY 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAUMONT, Texas _ As he stood atop Spindletop Hill a century ago
_ the most significant oil strike in U.S. history raining down
around him _ Capt. Anthony F. Lucas didn't give much thought to
preserving his place in history.
</P>
<P>
   Pity, really. For if he had, Lucas would have saved the people
planning a party to honor the birth of the Texas oil boom and a
couple of local surveyors a lot of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been a debate as to where the exact spot was,''
said Christy Marino, curator of the Gladys City Museum, which
re-creates the oil boom town born of Lucas' discovery.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem the debate has finally been settled. The
Spindletop 2001 Commission, which is planning the celebration to
mark the 100-year anniversary of the oil discovery on Jan. 10,
1901, and Beaumont-area surveyors Joe Breaux and Darrell Shine say
they now know where Lucas drilled his historic well.
</P>
<P>
   The location is not exactly scenic. After a century of mining
first for oil, then for sulfur, Spindletop is not much of a hill
anymore. The land has subsided and a marsh has formed in the
depression. The original well site is on private property
accessible only by a muddy mining road that is closed to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   The ground is littered with chunks of yellow sulfur and debris
from well sites long since abandoned. Remnants of Spindletop's
heyday can be found in the large wooden oil tanks still stained
with pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that something so significant has to be so
entangled,'' said Breaux, a surveyor for the Texas Department of
Transportation, who volunteers at Gladys City in his free time.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas can't be blamed for not making a more careful record of
his historic find. When he struck oil 1,000 feet below the surface
of a prairie hill in Beaumont, he was too busy trying to devise a
way to stop the enormous gusher that was spewing black-green crude
out of a 6-inch-wide hole in the ground at the rate of 100,000
barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   The gusher's plume shot 150 feet into the air. The Spindletop
strike was not the first oil discovery in the United States. Oil
wells were operating at the time in Lufkin, Nacogdoches and
Corsicana. Lucas had drilled oil in Louisiana. But never had it
been discovered in such quantity.
</P>
<P>
   It took Lucas nine days to cap his first well. By that time, the
oil rush was under way. Within a year and a half, there were 285
oil wells on Spindletop Hill and derricks were so thick a person
could walk from one to another without touching the ground.
</P>
<P>
   It was Breaux's connections to Gladys City that got him thinking
about how a Spindletop centennial celebration would be incomplete
without Lucas' original well site. It was his connections to the
Texas Society of Professional Surveyors that led him to the man
capable of conducting such a hunt: Darrell Shine.
</P>
<P>
   Shine spent the bulk of his career surveying Texas oil fields.
Today, he is a consultant in Silsbee who specializes in deciphering
old land records.
</P>
<P>
   There were many maps drawn of Spindletop Hill. And many of them
conflicted with one another when it came to the location of Lucas'
original strike.
</P>
<P>
   Shine said he solved the mystery by reviewing the maps drawn by
four separate surveyors of the time. He also corroborated his
findings by reviewing the journals of surveyors who worked the site
during the oil boom.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the records were found in the archives of Houston oil
companies that had mined Spindletop at one time or another, Shine
said. Others happened to be in Shine's personal collection of
surveying records.
</P>
<P>
   Shine knew he had the right place when he visited Spindletop to
take his measurements based on the old surveying maps. As he walked
to where the well should be located, he came upon a crude concrete
stand.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out the long-forgotten concrete platform once supported
the 58-foot-tall pink granite obelisk that was erected in 1941 to
honor the Spindletop strike. The obelisk stood near the site of the
strike just 14 years. It was moved once in 1955 and then to the
Gladys City Museum in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the surveyors have found the site of the Lucas gusher,
the Spindletop 2001 Commission wants to ensure it is never lost
again. On the cement platform, which stands just feet from the well
site, they have placed a small, round, brass plate designating the
ground as historic.
</P>
<P>
   The commission hopes to build a wooden observation platform
about a quarter-mile from the well site on West Port Arthur Road,
said Laurie Leister, a member of the Spindletop 2001 Commission. If
all goes according to plan, a marker would identify the well site
and there would be signs telling the Spindletop story.
</P>
<P>
   ``The importance of (Spindletop) is the way it affected the
world, and it really did,'' said Jo Ann Stiles, an associate
professor of history at Lamar University in Beaumont. She is
writing a book about the Spindletop strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``People kept asking where the original site was. Everybody
wants to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, apparently, they do.
</P>

 &HT;    Cremins' courtship over
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No more flying navy blazer. No more flapping gold tie.
No more flopping white hair. No more Bobby Cremins.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-year veteran Georgia Tech basketball coach pronounced his
love affair with Georgia Tech over on Friday. He announced his
resignation, to take effect at the end of this season.
</P>
<P>
   Cremins, criticized for Tech's lack of recent success, made it
official at an afternoon news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to remove the cloud of uncertainty from the
program,'' Cremins said. ``I wanted to give Tech ample time to
search for a new coach.''
</P>
<P>
   He will be on the sidelines for Tech's next five regular-season
games and at least one game in the ACC tournament before walking
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been four years since our last NCAA appearance, and
that's my responsibility,'' said Cremins, 52. ``I feel bad for my
staff, my players and our recruits.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech last went to the NCAA tournament in 1996 when it
won the regular-season ACC championship, reached the finals of the
ACC Tournament and made it into the round of 16 in the NCAAs before
losing to Cincinnati. Freshman Stephon Marbury, the leader of that
team, jumped to the NBA after his one year, and the team fell to
9-18 the next season.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, the Yellow Jackets have managed a record of only
18-41 in the ACC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never be able to repay Tech and (former athletic
director) Homer Rice,'' Cremins said, his voice breaking. ``But I'm
looking forward to the next chapter of my life. I'm still young
enough (that) I could coach again.''
</P>
<P>
   Cremins had three years remaining on his contract but reached an
amicable $1.5 million settlement. He will be paid $300,000 up front
and then will receive the remaining $1.2 million in 48 equal
payments over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   Cremins notified athletics director Dave Braine that he was
thinking about stepping down Jan. 30, but the coach said he reached
his final decision Thursday during a long walk in Baltimore after a
recruiting trip. ``I just felt it was time,'' he said. ``This is
life. It's business.''
</P>
<P>
   Cremins' golden era started with the recruitment of Mark Price
and John Salley, who played as freshmen on his 1983-84 team. With
those two as his cornerstones, Cremins took the Jackets to the NIT
that season, and then shocked the basketball world by winning the
ACC tournament in 1985 and reaching the NCAA regional semifinals
before losing to Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   He said his biggest thrill at Tech was winning his first ACC
title. ``I won the ring I could never win as a player (at South
Carolina),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That was the first of nine consecutive appearances as part of
March Madness, highlighted by a Final Four appearance in 1990. Tech
lost in the semifinals to eventual champion UNLV, 90-81.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Jackets have been ordinary, with the exception
of the Marbury year. This season, they 11-13 going into Monday's
game at Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Cremins said he had told everyone that he would do what needed
to be done. ``The only way I would have prolonged it is if Tech
hadn't taken care of me,'' he said. ``I had to protect myself and
my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Cremins conceded that, if he had been able to recapture his
previous success, this day would not have arrived. ``If the winning
had continued, I would not look at this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wants to be remembered as a good coach.
</P>
<P>
   In a very Cremins-like move, he brought his entire team into the
news conference. Some were crying, and all were red-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Babul, a junior forward, said Cremins will be remembered for
more than coaching. ``Coach is like a dad,'' he said. ``You won't
find any other coach who treats players better or cares more about
them than him.''

 &HT;    Drivers ticked about shocks
 &HT;    By Rick Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Darrell Waltrip starts from the back in Sunday's
Daytona 500. But he is up front about his assessment of the great
shock controversy for this year's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ain't supposed to be able to fix the car's handling with
shocks,'' Waltrip said. ``The shocks are just supposed to give it a
good ride. Springs and sway bars and that kind of thing are
supposed to fix 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, Winston Cup teams have developed custom-made
or ``trick'' shocks. By changing the internal mechanism of the
shock, teams made shocks that did not rebound, or raise a car's
body back up to its normal riding height after going through a bump
or a turn.
</P>
<P>
   Having the car's body lower to the pavement keeps air from going
under the car and that allows it to run faster.
</P>
<P>
   The negative part is a rough ride for the driver, because the
shocks no longer dowhat they were intended to do. Plus, the cars
often scrubbed the pavement, sometimes gouging the racing surface.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's answer to the problem was to dictate that normal shocks
would be run on each wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Teams practiced all winter with the new rules, but the first
major test came in Thursday's 125-mile qualifying races.
</P>
<P>
   Several drivers, including Bill Elliott and Robert Yates Racing
teammates Ricky Rudd and Dale Jarrett solved the handling issue.
Rudd won for the first time at Daytona, and Elliott got his first
Daytona victory since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But Dale Earnhardt saw his 10-year winning streak in the 125s
come to a screeching halt. He finished 11th in the first 125 and
was vocal in his criticism of the shock rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the worst racing I've seen at Daytona in a long time,''
Earnhardt said. ``We can't adjust and make our cars like we want.
They just killed the racing at Daytona.''
</P>
<P>
   Other drivers complained that their cars developed a push. When
a car is pushing in the turns, the driver is turning the wheel to
the left, but the car wants to continue going straight, as
passenger cars tend to do on icy surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip, who also experienced a push in his Ford, is not
surprised by the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys have spent hours, days, weeks working on nothing
but shocks,'' Waltrip said. ``So when you take that away from
people who have that kind of budget, that kind of knowledge, it
levels the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people don't want the field level. People don't want it
but one way, and that's their way, but I think NASCAR is on the
right track. I wish they'd do this everywhere. It would change
racing dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip also said the push is not a terminal problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``My car pushed bad, but you've just got to fix it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett, who dominated qualifying and the Bud Shootout,
agreed there are other ways to get the cars to handle better.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got springs, spring rubbers, track bars; you can change
the weight distribution; and you can move the fenders in and out,''
Jarrett said. ``There are tons of things you can do. You just have
to be willing to go there and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett said any change in the rules before Sunday would be a
bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people that did hit on it, it's not fair to take it away
from them,'' Jarrett said. ``You've just got to try something
different. There's no way NASCAR can make everybody happy.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR says there will be no rule changes before Sunday. And
Jarrett isn't writing off Earnhardt for the 500. ``He's like a
wounded lion _ more dangerous.''

 &HT;    OHIO FINDS LISTERIA IN ONE OF 96 CHICKEN NUGGET SHIPMENTS
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (w) Washington and (a) national
categories 
 &HT;    By ELLIOT JASPIN 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Ohio Department of Agriculture announced Friday
it had discovered Listeria, a potentially deadly pathogen, in one
of 96 shipments of Gold Kist chicken nuggets that were to be served
to school children in the state.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said they were impounding the lot and would do
further tests to discover the source of the contamination.
</P>
<P>
   The tests were done after several U.S. Agriculture Department
food safety inspectors at two Gold Kist poultry processing plants
in Alabama, where the chicken nuggets are produced, alleged two
weeks ago that the product was made in part from diseased birds.
Although the inspectors said the chicken nuggets posed no health
risk, Ohio officials decided to test the nuggets anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 96 shipments contains approximately 20,000 pounds of
chicken. They are provided to the state through the federal food
commodities program.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said the contamination of the single shipment
could have occurred almost anywhere, even including the time it was
tested at the Ohio Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said they notified the U.S. Agriculture
Department on Thursday. But Linda Swacina, spokesperson for the
agency, said Friday evening she was unaware of the discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have gone to great lengths to allay public
concerns after a Cox Newspapers story two weeks ago quoted several
government inspectors at the plant as saying that carcasses with
tumors, pus, and sores were being cut up into chicken nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Billy, head of the Agriculture Department's Food Safety
and Inspection Service, issued a press release on Feb. 11 saying
that the government had ``excellent controls'' at the plant and
that the chicken nuggets were ``safe and wholesome.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what the federal government's response will be to
the discovery of Listeria in Ohio. Swacina, who said she would get
further information for reporters, did not return repeated
telephone calls later in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Listeria can be killed by cooking it at a temperature of 160
degrees F. The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta estimates
1,100 people become seriously ill each year with the food borne
pathogen when it is not properly cooked. Approximately 25 percent
later die from the infection.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio officials said they remain confident that chicken nuggets
from the Gold Kist plant are safe and wholesome. A spokesperson for
the Ohio Department of Education said Listeria contamination is
common and that the bacteria is easily killed. However, she said
the lot discovered with the pathogen would not be served to
children.
</P>
<P>
   Some Ohio school districts saw the test results as further
confirmation that Gold Kist nuggets are safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was confident that would happen all the time,'' said JoAnne
Robinett, food service supervisor for Beavercreek City Schools.
``We actually did put the nuggets on hold for two weeks, awaiting
(the test results)... They are on our menu for next Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   The finding of Listeria in one sample, she said, was not a major
concern. ``If you heat it to the proper temperature, Listeria is
not a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But other local school officials are wary of the product.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't plan to have them on our menu for March,'' said Peggy
Barr, food service director for Troy City Schools. ``It's just the
public perception'' of them now.

30-MINUTE CAMPAIGN COMMERCIALS: MORE RAMBLING AND MORE INTIMATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ As candidate biographies go, one attesting to
great suffering under terrible circumstances might be considered
something close to ideal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came to as he plunged into a lake near his bombing
target,'' says the narrator of the 28-minute video shown on South
Carolina television this week. ``Quickly, an angry mob gathered,
seeking retribution for the rain of bombs. Dragging him from the
lake, they broke his shoulder with a rifle butt and bayoneted him
repeatedly.''
</P>
<P>
   The voters of New Hampshire and now, South Carolina, may be able
to recite some of these details in their sleep. The war story, of
course, is that of Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a former Navy pilot
who spent five and a half years in a North Vietnamese prison camp.
It is one of McCain's campaign's most valuable assets, a tale
recounted and alluded to frequently in his stump speeches and
television commercials, and told again in longer form in this
infomercial-style advertisement that was broadcast Tuesday evening
on a Columbia station, WIS.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's main opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, ran an
infomercial of his own here this week, a 30-minute excerpt from a
question-and-answer session over which the candidate presided
recently at the College of Charleston. Bush may not have a story of
personal sacrifice to match the senator's, but he has a folksy,
engaging way with a crowd, and that was the best foot his campaign
tried to put forward in his half-hour tape.
</P>
<P>
   If 30-second television commercials are the staple of a modern
political campaign, 30-minute programs have become a sort of
required side dish. Former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey
broadcast one on Iowa cable that had been filmed at a town hall
meeting in Sioux City; Steve Forbes bought half-hour slots at
dinnertime on stations in Des Moines and Manchester, N.H., for a
pair of live phone-in programs, and a highlight of Hillary Rodham
Clinton's announcement of her Senate candidacy was the screening of
a biographical film by her friend, the filmmaker Linda
Bloodworth-Thomason.
</P>
<P>
   Freed of the sound bite constraints of conveying messages in
30-second snippets, these long-form commercials are at once more
rambling and more intimate. Watching them reminds the viewer of how
infrequently candidates are permitted to go on a bit on camera and
reveal themselves, even under the most controlled conditions. This
was especially true of the programs devised by Bradley's and Bush's
image makers, who chose the same kind of political environment, a
Q&AMP;A with voters, for cinema verite-style pieces that documented
their men at work.
</P>
<P>
   Devoid of rancor, barely acknowledging each other's campaign,
the new program-length videos by the Bush and McCain campaigns
provided tranquil interludes in a Republican contest in South
Carolina that had grown increasingly testy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's infomercial, filmed outdoors at a rally here on Feb. 11,
showed him standing at a microphone in a gray suit, bantering with
his questioners and explaining his views on education, drug
treatment and foreign policy. McCain's program, a montage of
interviews, historical footage, anecdotes and previous commercials,
was a more reserved piece that seemed intended to imbue the
candidate with a statesmanlike quality.
</P>
<P>
   If the McCain infomercial was about a candidate with a story,
the Bush commercial portrayed a man still seeking to write one.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter who you're for, I want you to understand that I know
what it takes to be a leader,'' the governor declares in a booming
voice. It is a theme to which he returns several times. ``A leader
inspires for a better day,'' he says at another point. And at yet
another: ``I've been the chief executive officer of a state. I
understand what it means to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor is energetic at the microphone; a camera zooms in
on a candidate eager to ingratiate with self-deprecating humor and
country colloquialisms. ``For those of you that haven't made up
your mind yet _ people I affectionately call tire-kickers, thank
you for coming,'' Bush says in a Texas drawl.
</P>
<P>
   He also preaches a kind of divine inspiration in the video,
saying he will bring his faith to his White House work: ``I'm going
to recognize the power of faith when it comes to changing people's
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's infomercial deals with inspiration, too, but it is in
images, not words, that the most powerful moments emerge. In the
manner of an installment of A&AMP;E's biography series, parts of a talk
with the senator, who is dressed in a plaid shirt as he converses
with an off-screen interviewer, are interspersed with grainy
footage of the war and photographs of him in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   It is a story that does not seem to lose potency in the
recycling, and the anecdotes that McCain adds are urgent reminders
of what deprivation meant to him and his family. At one point, in a
story about his daughter's love of pets, he relates the
6-year-old's reaction to her mother's disclosure that McCain was
coming home after five and a half years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah?'' he quotes her as saying. ``Where will he sleep,
and what will we feed him?''

 &HT;    OHIO FINDS LISTERIA IN ONE OF 96 CHICKEN NUGGET SHIPMENTS
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (w) Washington and (a) national
categories 
 &HT;    By ELLIOT JASPIN 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Ohio Department of Agriculture announced Friday
it had discovered Listeria, a potentially deadly pathogen, in one
of 96 shipments of Gold Kist chicken nuggets that were to be served
to school children in the state.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said they were impounding the lot and would do
further tests to discover the source of the contamination.
</P>
<P>
   The tests were done after several U.S. Agriculture Department
food safety inspectors at two Gold Kist poultry processing plants
in Alabama, where the chicken nuggets are produced, alleged two
weeks ago that the product was made in part from diseased birds.
Although the inspectors said the chicken nuggets posed no health
risk, Ohio officials decided to test the nuggets anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 96 shipments contains approximately 20,000 pounds of
chicken. They are provided to the state through the federal food
commodities program.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said the contamination of the single shipment
could have occurred almost anywhere, even including the time it was
tested at the Ohio Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said they notified the U.S. Agriculture
Department on Thursday. But Linda Swacina, spokesperson for the
agency, said Friday evening she was unaware of the discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have gone to great lengths to allay public
concerns after a Cox Newspapers story two weeks ago quoted several
government inspectors at the plant as saying that carcasses with
tumors, pus, and sores were being cut up into chicken nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Billy, head of the Agriculture Department's Food Safety
and Inspection Service, issued a press release on Feb. 11 saying
that the government had ``excellent controls'' at the plant and
that the chicken nuggets were ``safe and wholesome.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what the federal government's response will be to
the discovery of Listeria in Ohio. Swacina, who said she would get
further information for reporters, did not return repeated
telephone calls later in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Listeria can be killed by cooking it at a temperature of 160
degrees F. The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta estimates
1,100 people become seriously ill each year with the food borne
pathogen when it is not properly cooked. Approximately 25 percent
later die from the infection.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio officials said they remain confident that chicken nuggets
from the Gold Kist plant are safe and wholesome. A spokesperson for
the Ohio Department of Education said Listeria contamination is
common and that the bacteria is easily killed. However, she said
the lot discovered with the pathogen would not be served to
children.
</P>
<P>
   Some Ohio school districts saw the test results as further
confirmation that Gold Kist nuggets are safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was confident that would happen all the time,'' said JoAnne
Robinett, food service supervisor for Beavercreek City Schools.
``We actually did put the nuggets on hold for two weeks, awaiting
(the test results)... They are on our menu for next Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   The finding of Listeria in one sample, she said, was not a major
concern. ``If you heat it to the proper temperature, Listeria is
not a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But other local school officials are wary of the product.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't plan to have them on our menu for March,'' said Peggy
Barr, food service director for Troy City Schools. ``It's just the
public perception'' of them now.

   AMBON, Indonesia _ At first glance he is one of the more forlorn
of the victims slumped on thin mattresses here in the Christian
hospital: a haggard middle-aged man staring at the dirty gauze
bandage that covers the stump of his missing right hand.
</P>
<P>
   But when he looks up, he almost seems ready to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bomb went off in my hand,'' he says, astonished all over
again at his own carelessness. ``It's the first time anything ever
went wrong. I whacked at it with my left hand and I got shrapnel
all over. Look at me. In my chest and my arms and my foot. I don't
hear too well, either.''
</P>
<P>
   His name is Joro Manduapessy. He is 58. He works as a janitor.
And for the last year, since a Muslim-Christian conflict broke out
here in the tropical islands of eastern Indonesia, killing as many
as 2,000 people and leaving 100,000 homeless, he has been a bomb
thrower in the cause of his God.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows me,'' he said proudly, ``because whenever
there's a fight, I'm there with my bombs protecting the churches.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had thrown scores of pipe bombs, stuffed with matches
and bamboo wicks, but he had no idea how many people he might have
killed or wounded. ``I just throw them and run,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I taught myself to make them,'' he added. ``The Christian
community here is like Israel: God gave us the spirit to know how
to make war.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of no man's land, in the Muslim enclave beside
the harbor, Bakri Marasabessy lay on a hospital bed working a
crossword puzzle with deliberate slowness as a gunshot wound healed
painfully in his left leg.
</P>
<P>
   He, too, seemed abashed at his carelessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything happened so fast that I didn't have time to get my
sword,'' he said. ``People were running toward the Christian
church, and so I ran too. Someone gave me a can of gasoline to burn
buildings. But then suddenly there's this sharp pain in my leg and
I fell down. I yelled out: `Oh, God! I'm shot!'''
</P>
<P>
   Marasabessy is 40, a public minibus driver and, proudly, a
soldier in Ambon's holy war against Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't my first riot,'' he said of the fighting in late
December, the same conflict in which Manduapessy was wounded. ``I
go to all the riots. I'm a fighter. But this time it was all so
sudden. If I'd known, I would have been prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was a member of a local group of holy warriors.
``Usually when we get a call to fight, we prepare ourselves,'' he
said. ``We take a bath and we pray. Then if we have to, we go and
burn their houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Manduapessy in his bed on the other side of town, he said
he fought only to defend his people against attacks from the other
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``My religion is under threat by the Christians,'' he said.
``They attack Muslim people in Muslim neighborhoods. We are angry
and we fight back.''
</P>
<P>
   So he was asked the obvious question.
</P>
<P>
   Aren't the Christians fighting to defend their religion, too?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yes,'' he said. ``Both sides fight to defend their
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   The little war here between communities that lived in peace for
generations has a breathtaking, senseless purity. Since it began
with a traffic dispute 12 months ago, its fighters seem to have
been motivated by the uncomplicated logic of retribution.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Manduapessy nor Marasabessy is a freelancer. Both said
they had the spiritual and material support of their religious
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sitting quietly beside her husband the bomb thrower, Dana
Manduapessy said she had resigned herself to his risky calling,
although she worries about who will support the family now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I told him: `Don't go. It's dangerous,''' she said.
``But actually, since he got all the bomb-making material from the
church, there wasn't much I could say.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders here do not quite deny that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, OK, the church gives support,'' said the Rev. Sammy
P. Titaley, the most prominent Protestant churchman in Ambon. As
for providing bomb-making materials, he said: ``The church as an
organization, no. Lay people, maybe yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``If we don't defend ourselves, you know, our houses
are attacked and burned. That's why we have to make a defense.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mr. and Mrs. Manduapessy have four children, ranging in age from
16 to 36. Only the second child, who is 27, has taken an interest
in his father's calling, sometimes carrying his bombs for him.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Manduapessy seemed to be a more passionate fighter than his
counterpart, the Muslim swordsman across town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I hate them,'' he said of the Muslims. ``They attack our
churches. They rape our women. They burn and loot.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lying in his bed in the Muslim hospital, his wounded leg
pinioned by a sack of rocks, Marasabessy said: ``Of course I have
Christian friends. Before the chaos started we all lived
together.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, before Ambon split into separate, terrified warring
sectors, he said, he carried plenty of Christian passengers in his
minivan. ``I wouldn't know if they were Christian or not,'' he
said. ``In the past nobody cared about that.''
</P>
<P>
   He had Christian co-workers as well.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, waiting for a passenger outside the governor's
office in a neutral area, he said, he ran into one of those
friends, a man named Yance, ``a driver like me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We embraced each other,'' Marasabessy said. ``I asked him:
`How did this happen? Why are we in this situation?' And my friend
said, `Yeah, I don't know either.'''

IN MOSCOW, VIEWS DIVERGE ON MEANING OF CHECHEN WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Muscovites awoke Wednesday to find a pamphlet stuck in
their mailboxes telling them what to do if a bomb explodes in their
building and they find themselves trapped under tons of rubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what, DO NOT PANIC. . . . Try not to lose hope,
breath deeply and evenly, prepare yourself to suffer hunger and
thirst,'' read the anonymous two-page brochure. It hinted at a new
wave of deadly apartment blasts similar to the explosions that
killed 293 Russians last summer, which authorities blamed on
separatist Chechen militants.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, another publication with a menacing message
appeared, a newspaper put out jointly by many of Moscow's leading
media, with headlines proclaiming a different kind of threat.
Called ``Obshchaya Gazeta'' or ``Common Newspaper,'' the four-page
issue declared that free speech in Russia was in grave danger and
the Soviet-style suppression of dissidents was underway.
</P>
<P>
   Far from the death and destruction of Chechnya, the contrasting
warnings epitomized the way the war in the rebellious Caucasus
region has divided Russia into two camps with irreconciliable, but
equally dire, views of the larger meaning of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The message behind the bomb pamphlet represents the belief
shared by the government, the military, and most Russians: that the
Chechen rebels represent a threat that must be crushed to ensure
peace and stability in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper united the views of Russia's liberals, some
journalists, and human rights groups, as well as those of many
Western observers, who see events in Chechnya as an increasingly
clear signal that democracy in Russia is in peril. The joint effort
was a repeat of a special edition that liberal media published in
1991 during a coup attempt by hardline Soviet leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the journalists were on the side of the government,
helping Boris N. Yeltsin face down the coup. This time, they are
mostly on their own.
</P>
<P>
   For days, Russian spokesmen and state-run television have been
warning of possible terrorist attacks on Feb. 23, which is both
Russia's Army Day and the anniversary of the day in 1944 when
Soviet dictator Josef Stalin sent the Chechen people into mass
exile in Siberia and Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The official Russian view is that the 7,000 Chechen ``bandits''
and ``terrorists,'' increasingly desperate after being driven out
of the capital Grozny into the mountains of southern Chechnya,
might resort to attacks outside their republic to force a
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   The journalists' ad hoc newspaper, meanwhile, focused on the
plight of Andrei Babitsky, a correspondent for US-financed Radio
Liberty who disappeared after Russia detained him and then said it
had handed him over to the rebels in exchange for Russian
prisoners. Babitsky's friends and colleagues fear the exchange was
a sham to give the Russians an excuse to incarcerate or even kill
Babitsky and blame it on the Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky has infuriated the Kremlin and its generals with daily
reports, mainly from rebel-controlled areas, of Russian setbacks
and abuses by Russian soldiers. A joint statement in the paper said
Babitsky's disappearance of ``an effort to shut up those who are
trying to say out loud what is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscow routinely dismisses criticism of the war, including that
of Western media and human rights groups, as disinformation based
on rebel propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's deputy military chief of staff, Colonel General Valery
Manilov, pledged Friday to investigate a wave of new reports of
abuses by Russian troops, although he said most of the reports
appeared unsubstantiated.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based Human Rights Watch and Moscow-based Memorial
have charged that Russian guards at a prison camp inside Chechnya
torture, beat, and on occasion rape civilians in order to extract
confessions of rebel activity. A Kremlin spokesman on Thursday,
denying reports of abuses, said journalists would be allowed to
visit the camp.
</P>
<P>
   United Nations human rights High Commissioner Mary Robinson has
complained that Moscow blocked her access to Chechnya, and US State
Department spokesman James Rubin said Thursday that Russia had ``a
clear obligation to investigate the numerous credible reports of
civilian killings and alleged misconduct by its soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's remarks earned a sharp rebuke from Russia's Foreign
Ministry, which said the US reaction was ``tantamount to
cooperating in a campaign of information terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Such bitter exchanges have fueled charges in Moscow that Western
governments, using journalists and rights workers as pawns, want to
support the rebels and weaken Russia. This line has been
rebroadcast on Russian Public Television, known here as ORT, which
is the nation's most watched, and according to a recent survey,
most trusted news station. Over half the respondents said they
believed its reports, but only 2 percent said they trusted the news
they heard on Radio Liberty or the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures help explain why few Russians outside Moscow and
St. Petersburg have expressed concern for Babitsky's fate, and why
other Russian journalists are feeling pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are not getting better for the freedom of speech,''
said Yury Solomonov, an editor who helped compile the special
edition of Obschchaya Gazeta. He pointed out that media owned by
companies with close ties to the government boycotted the special
edition.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, acting president Vladimir Putin has used the war to
build what many see as an insurmountable lead in the campaign for
the March 26 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Manilov said the military campaign in Chechnya would
probably last about one more month. That would allow Putin to
declare victory on the eve of the vote, wiping away the humiliation
of Moscow's botched 1994-96 campaign that left Chechnya with de
facto independence for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Manilov said the rebels had lost more than 11,000 fighters since
Russian troops attacked in October. He said Russia had lost 1,221
troops dead. Both sides frequently accuse each other of
misreporting casualties, but the key number may be this: Manilov
acknowledged 45 Russian dead and 92 wounded over the past week.
</P>
<P>
   That the rebels can still inflict such heavy losses is a sign
that the fighting might not be over as quickly as Moscow would
like.

SOUTH CAROLINA VARIABLES ARE GIVING POLLSTERS HEADACHES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Even candidates in close elections usually have
some advance knowledge of whether they are going to win. Based on
their internal polls, and a combination of outside polls and
professional wisdom, they can decide whether to order champagne for
an election-night party.
</P>
<P>
   But not this year, and not in this state. Saturday's Republican
primary has become one of the hardest to predict of any nationally
significant vote in decades, and the candidates don't really know
whether to trust their own polls. For that matter, the pollsters
aren't so sure themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the hardest thing I've ever had to deal with,'' said
David Woodard, a political science professor at Clemson University
who directs the Palmetto Poll, which, like most surveys, officially
shows Gov. George W. Bush of Texas with a slight lead. ``To some
extent, we closed our eyes and threw a dart.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just that the race is close; that has never stopped a
pollster before. It is because no one really knows who is going to
vote Saturday and how many voters there will be. With so many
unprecedented events and unpredictable variables at work, many
polls vary widely in their predictions, though all claim scientific
accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Because anyone registered can vote in the primary regardless of
party affiliation, most pollsters try to surmise how many
independent and Democratic voters are likely to show up. They know
from exit polls in previous primaries how many have shown up
before, but that number suddenly means little. This year, in a
remarkable showing for an essentially conservative Republican, Sen.
John McCain of Arizona has attracted a great many non-Republicans
to his side, along with a substantial number of regular
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, complicating matters further, have canceled their
primary, leaving many Democrats with nothing better to do Saturday
than participate in the Republican race. There have been previous
years with no Democratic primary, but never one in which a
Republican candidate had exhibited such widespread appeal to
crossover voters. Democrats weren't interested in either Bob Dole
or Pat Buchanan in 1996, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters usually assume that young voters and newcomers to the
state are not likely to turn out heavily in a primary. But does
that hold true this year? McCain may well stimulate those groups to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   In building a representative sample of voters to include in a
survey, pollsters have to make a series of assumptions about who is
likely to vote. Woodard's poll surveyed two separate groups:
Republicans who had voted in previous primaries, and other active
voters who sometimes vote Republican but could also be independents
or Democrats. Then he estimated _ but actually, as he admitted,
guessed _ that the latter group would constitute between 55 and 70
percent of this year's turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't really know,'' he said. ``You can use a formula, but
it might be a little bogus.''
</P>
<P>
   Other polls use different techniques to arrive at a sample. The
Gallup Organization, which polled in this election for CNN and USA
Today, did not choose its respondents based on public rolls of who
had voted before, as the Palmetto Poll did. Instead, it randomly
called a large number of residents around the state and asked
whether they planned to vote. Those people who said they would vote
were included in the survey, regardless of party.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with this technique is that many people who say they
will vote do not actually show up at the polls. Frank Newport,
editor in chief of the Gallup Polls, said that over the decades his
organization has developed a variety of methods to whittle the
group down to real voters, such as asking people where they vote
and how much interest they have in the race. Although this method
is considered perfectly legitimate in the polling industry, other
pollsters said privately that it was no more likely to be accurate
than any other.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, the Gallup poll this week bore little
resemblance to the others. It showed Bush with a 12-point lead over
McCain, and had a 5 percent margin of error. By contrast, polls
taken by NBC, Zogby International, and Woodard showed Bush with a
6-point, 3-point, and 2-point lead, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   And Woodard put out a press release with his poll saying that if
total turnout is significantly greater than in previous years,
McCain will win.
</P>
<P>
   Newport, who is a bit more formal and restrained than Woodard,
made no dart-board analogies. But even he acknowledged that this
year's South Carolina primary was rough going.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does present a certain challenge to the survey scientist,''
he said. ``But sometimes you just have to step up to the plate and
accept that challenge.''

<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Saturday's South Carolina primary was supposed
to be the ``firewall'' that would halt any challenger still trying
to stop Gov. George W. Bush's march to the Republican presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But it's been a political firestorm here since Sen. John McCain
shocked the GOP establishment with an 18-point victory in New
Hampshire nearly three weeks ago. He made up a 20-point deficit in
Palmetto State opinion polls, and it's been close to a dead heat
ever since, though Bush showed a significant surge in a poll
released on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates expressed confidence of victory as they
crisscrossed the state in a final appeal for votes this week. A win
for Bush could erase the doubts that surfaced after his New
Hampshire loss. But analysts say he may not recover from a defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a feisty side to me, and I wanted people to see that
I was going come and battle for the vote. And I have,'' Bush told
reporters. He confidently added this prediction: ``You can write it
down on your pad of paper: Bush wins.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also predicted victory, declaring ''the establishment
can't stop us.'' He vowed to press on regardless of the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign is not over until March 7 in California and a
number of other states,'' McCain told a group of veterans Thursday.
``But I'll tell you what my friends, if we win here, I don't see
how we can really be stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens, political experts universally agree
there has never been anything quite like the dogfight that has
emerged in this first southern presidential primary. Campaign
spending and a blitzkrieg of advertising have broken all previous
records, and media attention is greater than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had anything really comparable,'' said Jim Guth, a
political scientist at Furman University in Greenville. ``I don't
recall a situation where the airwaves have been as saturated.''
Bush alone has reportedly been spending $3 million a week here,
much of it on television and radio advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina primary, started in 1980, is the brainchild
of native son Lee Atwater, the late, hardball consultant who ran
the elder George Bush's successful 1988 campaign. It has long been
seen as a ''firewall'' between first-test New Hampshire and the
larger, delegate-rich contests in such states as California, New
York and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, for example, Sen. Bob Dole lost New Hampshire to Pat
Buchanan. But South Carolina _ seen as friendly to mainstream
candidates with establishment backing _ gave Dole a solid victory,
and Buchanan never recovered in later contests.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is clearly hoping for the same result, and he has nearly
every member of the GOP establishment here behind him _ including
former GOP Govs. Carroll Campbell and David Beasley, Lt. Gov. Bob
Peeler and Sen. Strom Thurmond.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, the governor also warned ``weak-kneed''
supporters who have recently jumped ship to McCain _ including
California's highest ranking Republican _ to tread carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to win,'' Bush said. ``These people who are getting
nervous now are going to regret getting nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, on the other hand, enjoys the support of many new guard
Republicans who have bucked their party's leaders. Popular U.S.
Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, a lead House prosecutor in
last year's impeachment saga, has appeared with McCain at nearly
every stop in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   And former GOP candidate Gary Bauer, a staunch pro-lifer who
ended his campaign after a poor showing in New Hampshire, has
endorsed McCain, a move the campaign hopes will shore up his
flagging support among religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Talking to reporters this week aboard his bus, dubbed
the''Straight Talk Express,'' McCain said he welcomed voters from
any corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Democrats are saying they're going to vote for me. I
say God bless you. That's what Ronald Reagan was able to assemble _
a coalition of so-called Reagan Democrats. That's the way you
govern in this country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll released yesterday,
Bush has pulled significantly ahead of McCain _ 52 percent to 40
percent. Most other recent polls show the race to be a statistical
dead heat. According to news reports, turnout in early voting has
been high and may set a record.
</P>
<P>
   While McCain surged ahead of Bush just after the New Hampshire
primary, he has seen his fortunes decline somewhat. Interviews with
voters, campaign aides and political observers say the advertising
assault on McCain _ and his abrupt decision to pull all negative
ads _ have taken a toll on the senator's once stellar image among
voters here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You let charges go unchallenged, and that is something that
potentially has repurcussions,'' said Bill Moore, a political
scientist at the College of Charleston. Moore also said an early
McCain response ad comparing Bush to Clinton _ later pulled _
backfired somewhat. Staff writer Ron Hutcheson contributed to this
report.

HANGING ON IN ZIMBABWE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Mugabe, the founding father of Zimbabwe, ought to have
followed George Washington's example and retired after eight years
as the nation's leader. Instead he has stayed on for 12 more, and
only last week did his countrymen, voting in a referendum,
decisively rebuff his rule.
</P>
<P>
   The vote for a new constitution was intended to entrench Mugabe
as president and, as a sop to his base of support, mandate the
transfer of farmland from whites to blacks. But many landless
blacks in the countryside did not turn out to vote, and city people
decisively rejected the constitution. The cities have felt the
brunt of economic policies that have devastated the country.
</P>
<P>
   One of Mugabe's great achievements in the 1980s was to encourage
the whites to remain on the land. Their agricultural expertise,
combined with free-market government policies, encouraged food
production during a drought in mid-decade. Mugabe also prevented
tensions between his Shona people and the Ndebele from erupting
into civil war. Had he left office in 1987 or 1988, he would have
been considered a great first president.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Africans who lead their countries to independence,
Mugabe hung on, as did his flock of retainers. He built a 30-room
mansion for his wife, persecuted gays, and last year embroiled
Zimbabwe in a war in Congo. Worst of all, he wrecked the economy.
He was a Marxist in his younger days and never renounced the
fallacy that the state should play the dominant role in economic
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe is 75. He ought to resign, but he shows no sign of
relaxing his hold on power. Members of his party are plotting a
comeback in the April parliamentary elections. Eventually he will
leave office, but his successor will inherit a nation in shambles.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why he would leave office after two terms, Washington
said that he wished to give ``an early example of rotation in an
office of so high and delicate a nature.'' Zimbabwe has many
problems _ among them land shortages, the AIDS epidemic, uncertain
prices for its agricultural exports _ but it would be better off
today if its president had heeded Washington's 200-year-old
message.

 &HT;    Stocks sink in `confused' market
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Stocks fell across a broad front Friday as investors
tried to digest the previous day's comments by Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan. He virtually assured Wall Street of
additional interest rate hikes.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell almost 300 points in
losing 2.8 percent Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's comments were bad short-term news for corporate
profits even if the Fed's motive is to combat inflation in the long
term, as the Fed chairman suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's session was an options-expiration day ahead of a long
weekend. They may have added to the volatility, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   While investors grappled with Greenspan's inflation warnings,
based on the economy's persistent strength, they also had to weigh
two January inflation reports that were highly favorable.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the government said the producer, or wholesale,
price index was unchanged last month, and the core rate even
declined. On Friday, the government said the Consumer Price Index
rose a less-than-expected 0.2 percent, and the core rate _ minus
food and energy _ rose 0.2 percent as anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The markets are confused, plain and simple,'' said Wachovia
Securities research director John J. White Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, say analysts, is the divergence in the market
between the high-flying technology stocks _ leaders of the
so-called ``new economy'' _ and the rapid recent decline of
interest-sensitive and other ``old economy'' blue chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening today is not the end of the divergence
between `new economy' and `old economy' stocks, but rather just
profit taking in front of a long weekend,'' Peter Cardillo,
director of research at Westfalia Investments, told Dow Jones News
Service.
</P>
<P>
   While the technology-loaded Nasdaq composite fell by 3 percent
Friday, it is only 1.7 percent below its record, while the Dow is
off 12.8 percent from its high mark.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking the Nasdaq's overall performance was impossible for
part of the day Friday because of a broken communications line at
the electronic marketplace's computer headquarters. That left the
market temporarily without numbers on Nasdaq indexes
</P>
<P>
   Trading in individual Nasdaq stocks was not affected.

GOVERNOR SCRAMBLES TO CALM FUROR OVER HIGHWAY PROJECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Governor Paul Cellucci scrambled Friday to assure
federal highway authorities that the state can find a way to cover
the $1.4 billion cost overrun for the massive road project known as
the Big Dig.
</P>
<P>
   In swift succession, Cellucci filed legislation outlining his
financing plan, asked for cooperation powerful state House speaker,
Thomas M. Finneran, and called on US Senator Edward M. Kennedy to
act as an intermediary between Massachusetts and federal officials
who have threatened to cut off future funding for the $12.2 billion
project.
</P>
<P>
   While his efforts may have been expected, given the stern
warning from Washington, the language of the governor's bill was
not. It left out one key aspect of the proposal he had announced
earlier in the week, toll increases.
</P>
<P>
   Observers believe Cellucci removed the controversial issue of
tolls to make the package more likely to win approval from
legislators before March 15, the deadline by which federal
officials say Massachusetts needs to have a financing plan in
place.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as federal auditors prepare to descend on Boston to
scrutinize the project next week, James J. Kerasiotes, who presides
over the Big Dig, privately told high-level officials working on
the funding crisis in Washington that he believes he may lose his
job, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerasiotes, the chairman of the Massachusetts Turnpike
Authority, is nervously awaiting the auditors, who are seeking
answers about contracts that have swelled in price and asking
Kerasiotes did not let highway officials know about the shortfall
sooner, an issue that angered US Transportation Secretary Rodney E.
Slater as much as the funding crisis itself, said those familiar
with the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Federal Highway Authority in Boston and
Washington did not return calls seeking comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Slater issued a statement threatening to halt Big
Dig funding unless the state devises an acceptable plan to pay for
the recently announced $1.4 billion gap.
</P>
<P>
   Slater also warned that there could be ``changes in
leadership,'' a remark that sources believe could be aimed at Peter
C. Markle, the regional Federal Highway administrator who oversees
how the agency's funding is spent in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next week he could get fired,'' said one Big Dig source about
the arrival of federal auditors.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, members of the congressional delegation downplayed
threats by the Federal Highway Authority to cut off funding, saying
that Washington has invested too much in the project to walk away
from the enormous construction site under the city. But they
believe the highway authority wants Massachusetts to demonstrate
that it can cover the cost overrun.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci appears to be moving intently to restore the faith of
federal highway officials. In adddition to his legislation, which
calls for $1 billion in borrowing, the governor said he would move
immediately to cash in part of a controversial insurance policy,
which would raise $150 million. He said he will also order the
Turnpike Authority to contribute $200 million in cash and sell some
real estate, although no specifics were available Friday night.
Those actions do not require legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released late Friday, Cellucci said fare
increases in the harbor tunnels and eastern points on the turnpike
were ``still under discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Cellucci has said that he did not want to impose higher
tolls in January, a year earlier than scheduled, the $60 million
the tolls would generate were part of his initial financing
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   If the increases are implemented, tolls between Route 128 and
Boston would jump from 50 cents to $1, and tunnel fees would
increase from $2 to $3 for cars and $3 to $5 for cabs.
</P>
<P>
   However, Cellucci appeared to be backing off Friday, after
Finneran said he was opposed to the hikes.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran, who met with Cellucci at the State House Friday
morning, said the House ``would not be reflexively critical of the
(governor's) plan but would reserve rights to scrutinize or modify
it.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, the speaker left the door open for a House plan,
which requires a bigger cash contribution from the Turnpike
Authority and the use of driver's license fees to leverage $600
million in state bonds.
</P>
<P>
   However, Finneran did signal willingness to reach an agreement
quickly. ``We should not lose sight of the importance of the
project,'' Finneran said. ``It's important to keep the work
continuing and the project moving ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to restore political calm as legislators review
his plan, Cellucci is relying on Kennedy to act as an intermediary
between the State House and Slater, hoping the diplomatic senior
senator can use his White House connections to calm the
transportation chief's outrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thrust is, they want to calm everything down,'' said one
source close to Kennedy.

   CAMP BONDSTEEL, Yugoslavia _ As a U.S. staff sergeant appeared
Friday at a hearing on charges of committing indecent acts with an
11-year-old Albanian girl and then murdering her, details emerged
about the investigation of a second U.S. soldier linked to the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Staff Sgt. Frank J. Ronghi, 35, of the 504th Parachute Infantry
Regiment, has been in detention since Jan. 13, when the body of
Merita Shabiu was found outside the town of Vitina in southern
Kosovo. Friday he appeared before an Army investigating officer at
a preliminary hearing to establish whether he should be
court-martialed.
</P>
<P>
   He faces charges of premeditated murder and committing indecent
acts with a child, which Army officials said precluded a rape
charge. If it found him guilty, a court martial could impose the
maximum penalty of death or life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   As witnesses gave their accounts, it appeared that a second
soldier, a private, had told his commanders that he was with Ronghi
and had helped dispose of the body.
</P>
<P>
   The private did not appear at the hearing, but an Army lawyer
confirmed that the private was under investigation in connection
with the case.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate case, several soldiers from the same unit are also
being investigated for alleged misconduct and inappropriate
behavior toward local people in Vitina.
</P>
<P>
   The victim's parents, Ramzije and Hamdi Shabiu, and her great
uncle Rifat Samakova attended the hearing, seeing for the first
time the man accused of her murder. Ronghi sat impassively, with
his lawyers sitting on either side and his back to reporters and
the girl's family. He did not testify during the hearing, which
lasted some five hours.
</P>
<P>
   Many details surrounding the girl's murder, including the actual
cause of death, have yet to be made public, because the
investigation reports have not yet been completed, an Army lawyer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the evidence given Friday by 10 witnesses _ including
members of the criminal investigation teams, commanders and
Ronghi's fellow soldiers _ revealed some of the circumstances of
the death and the profound impact it has had on the unit.
</P>
<P>
   One sergeant described how a private under his command had told
him what happened on the evening of Jan. 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was nervous, really nervous,'' the sergeant said of the
private. ``He asked me: `Can I trust you? Can I really trust
you?'''
</P>
<P>
   The private then told him that Ronghi had loaded what seemed to
be a body into their armored vehicle and driven it to woods outside
Vitina, where it was dumped. The private, who had been controlling
the automatic weapon in the turret of the vehicle, helped his
comrade dispose of the body, according to his and others' accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant, his voice shaking, said he had sought out one of
his superiors and that together they had gone to the site. Off the
road, he said, they found the body in plastic bags, half-covered
with snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I moved a block of snow and saw it was a thigh,'' the sergeant
said. ``The body was in a fetal position and I could see flesh
through the bag. It looked like it had no clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the sergeant, on their return he and his superior
woke Ronghi, who at first insisted that nothing had happened that
day. When they said that they had found the body, Ronghi calmly
told them that he had seen two local men take the girl into a
yellow apartment building in central Vitina, and that, after the
men had left, he had gone in to investigate. When he found her
body, he said, he panicked and decided to move it.
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant said Ronghi then asked: ``Can we handle this in a
different way?'' adding, ``I have money.''
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant said his superior refused, adding that the criminal
investigation department was then alerted.
</P>
<P>
   According to another sergeant who questioned the private that
night, the soldier told him that at about midday Ronghi walked up
to his armored vehicle, dismissed the interpreter and commandeered
the vehicle with the private, supposedly to escort senior officers.
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry H. Shelton,
was visiting Vitina that day.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the private's account, Ronghi instead drove to
the yellow apartment building, loaded into it what he said was
firewood for local Serbs and then drove quickly out of town.
</P>
<P>
   The witness added that the private had admitted helping dispose
of the body, by suggesting a new place to put it, kicking snow over
it and pouring antifreeze over traces of blood.
</P>
<P>
   The private told the witness that Ronghi had warned him to
``keep his mouth shut,'' saying, ``It's easy to get away with this
in a Third World country.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronghi did not enter a plea, but in closing remarks to the
investigating officer, the defense counsel appeared to be making
the case for a lesser charge, arguing that much of the evidence
indicated no apparent premeditation.
</P>
<P>
   The investigating officer will now consider the evidence and
within a week is expected to make a recommendation to a Special
Court Martial Convening Authority in Kosovo. That group will then
pass on a recommendation to Maj. Gen. John Abizaid, the 1st
Infantry Division commander, who will decide whether to refer the
case to a court martial.

UBS OUSTS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF ITS PRIVATE BANKING UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ UBS AG of Switzerland, the world's biggest
bank in terms of assets, replaced the head of its private banking
business Friday and announced a broad reorganization to stem the
loss of wealthy clients.
</P>
<P>
   The move highlighted the extent to which rivals in Europe and
the United States have been able to chip away at one of
Switzerland's most valuable franchises: the discreet care of the
world's richest people.
</P>
<P>
   It also reflected UBS' continuing difficulties after its merger
three years ago with Swiss Bank Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the bank was rocked by huge losses stemming from
the near collapse of the American hedge-fund, Long Term Capital
Management.
</P>
<P>
   Those losses led to the resignation of UBS's president, Mathis
Cabiallavetta, as well as to a renewed focus on the banks' more
conservative private banking business.
</P>
<P>
   But the bank may have been too conservative. Analysts say UBS's
funds under management grew by only 5 percent in the first nine
months of 1999, about half as fast as the industry as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason was UBS's reliance on a fairly conservative,
value-based investment strategy employed by its asset management
division. With Internet stocks and technology stocks in general
drove stock markets to record highs, many customers at UBS were
left out of the boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clients were basically not happy with the bank,'' said
Madeleine Hofmann, a banking analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston
in Zurich.
</P>
<P>
   Pretax profit from private banking fell to 635 million Swiss
francs ($392 million) in the third quarter from 1.1 billion francs
a year earlier. In December, the bank abandoned a plan to double
the assets by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Under the restructuring announced Friday, UBS will consolidate
its operations under three broad business units: UBS Switzerland,
UBS Asset Management and UBS Warburg, its investment banking unit.
</P>
<P>
   UBS Switzerland will contain most of the existing private
banking business, serving both wealthy individuals and corporate
clients.
</P>
<P>
   But wealthy private clients outside of Switzerland will be
served by UBSs Warburg Dillon Read investment bank. The theory,
according to bank executives, is that many of the foreign clients
already have contracts through the investment banking business.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the overhaul, UBS essentially ousted the chief
executive of its private banking division, Rudi Bogni. He will be
replaced by another bank executive, Georges Gagnebin.
</P>
<P>
   Marcel Ospel, UBS's chief executive, said the changes will give
UBS ``the agility to respond fast to changing client demands,
allowing us to increase our momentum significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   But analysts were not impressed, describing the changes as a
reshuffling that would have little lasting impact. ``It is not a
big deal,'' said Hofmann of Credit Suisse.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were not impressed either. Though shares of UBS
initially jumped on news of the reorganization, they slid back
later and ended the day up less than 1 percent at 417 Swiss francs.

STOCKS DECLINE ACROSS THE BOARD AMID INTEREST-RATE ANXIETY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The leading stock indexes plunged about 3 percent
Friday, and technology issues finished much lower as investors
focused on the stark prospect of rising short-term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   It is a future that Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan
Greenspan promised in congressional testimony Thursday, when many
investors seemed to shrug it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``He basically said that I am going to tighten until the stock
market goes down,'' said Thomas Connor, head government trader at
J.P. Morgan Securities, referring to Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   What Greenspan has indicated repeatedly _ and said quite
pointedly on Thursday _ is that if the Fed is to succeed in slowing
economic growth and curbing the threat of inflation, the persistent
sharp rise in stock prices of the last five years will have to end.
Only then will the so-called wealth effect, the increase in
spending fueled by the rise in the value of assets like stocks and
homes, be contained and consumer spending constrained.
</P>
<P>
   ``With foreign economies strengthening and labor markets already
tight,'' Greenspan warned, ``how the current wealth effect is
finally contained will determine whether the extraordinary
expansion that it has helped foster can slow to a sustainable pace,
without destabilizing the economy in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   While investors were selling stocks Friday, many were buying
Treasury bonds and notes, sending bond prices higher and interest
rates lower, despite the threat of higher rates to come from the
Federal Reserve. This shift to bonds could be another signal that
investors fear a further decline in stocks. ``When you see bond
prices going up and the stock market going down, you know that
concerns about the economy are growing,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief
investment officer at First Albany Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in stocks was across the board, with technology
stocks joining the selloff. Until now, technology stocks have
appeared immune to the bad news that pummeled other stocks this
year. On Thursday, for example, the Dow Jones industrial average
fell almost 47 points in the wake of Greenspan's testimony, but the
technology-heavy Nasdaq index rose 121.27 to another record high.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Dow fell 295.05 points, or 2.8 percent, to
10,219.52, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index dropped
42.17 points, or 3 percent, to 1,346.09. The Nasdaq plunged 137.18
points, or 3 percent, to 4,411.74. The Dow is now down 11.1 percent
for the year, while the S&AMP;P is off 8.4 percent. The Nasdaq is the
sole winner for the year with a gain of 8.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For about two hours Friday, investors were unable to see how
fast or far the Nasdaq composite was falling because of a
communications line malfunction. The problem did not interrupt
trading of Nasdaq stocks, Nasdaq said in a statement. When the
disruption began about midday, the Nasdaq was down about 13 points.
When reporting resumed, it was down nearly 75 points.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sectors that led the stock market lower were computer
software, semiconductor, bank and brokerage firm, health care and
oil stocks. A decline in interest rates normally can help financial
stocks. But if investors think the economy will slow down, they
worry that businesses and consumers will have trouble repaying
their debts, making credit risk an issue for financial stocks. Oil
stocks slipped _ oil prices have reached a nine-year high _ on
indications that major producers will increase production soon.
</P>
<P>
   In the bond market, the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note
fell to 6.48 percent, from 6.56 on Thursday. The yield on the
two-year note, which is more sensitive to Federal Reserve interest
rate moves, slipped to 6.63 percent from 6.65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The recent performance of the 30-year bond has been distorted by
Treasury plans to reduce issuance and buy back longer-term Treasury
securities with the federal budget surplus. As investors have
snapped up the long-term bond in expectation that its value will
rise as it becomes more scarce, the price has risen. But it is
losing its status as the Treasury market benchmark. Its yield
dropped to 6.15 percent from 6.22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency
Economics, said that some of the bond rally Friday came as
investors shifted some money from stocks to bonds. But he
attributed more of the rally to the report that inflation remained
in check. Consumer prices rose just 0.2 of a percent in January,
less than the 0.3 of a percent that had been forecast.
</P>
<P>
   But the report understates current price pressures, Shepherdson
says, in part because gasoline price increases have not shown up
yet. In addition, consumer inflation will get a boost in February
from tobacco products, airfares and the cost of renting and
homeownership. With those increases, he expects the Consumer Price
Index to surge 0.6 of a percent this month. ``The bond market isn't
going to like it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist at Hoenig &AMP; Co., said
that Greenspan has put investors on notice.
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday, Barbera argued that Greenspan's comments and the
Federal Reserve rate cuts in 1998 to help the global economy were
viewed as proof that the central bank would not let stocks tumble
too far.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors, Barbera said, took this to mean that there was a
``floor'' under the stock market _ that it could fall only so far.
With some downside protection, investors just had more desire to
buy stocks, he argued, making it much harder for Fed rate increases
to curb the stock rally and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   But with Thursday's testimony, Barbera said, Greenspan took away
the hope for further big stock rallies and warned that the stock
market could fall more than a little. Greenspan said that he would
``raise interest rates enough to cap the annual rise in the stock
market to no more than the rise in personal income, roughly 6.5
percent.'' That is well below the strong double-digit annual
returns of the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   In the corporate bond market Friday, the Bank of Tokyo sold $2
billion in 10-year notes to raise more capital for the bank in a
deal led by J.P. Morgan and Merrill Lynch. The note yielded 8.409
percent, 1.874 percentage points above the yield on the 10-year
Treasury note.

 GREENVILLE, S.C.: on the right.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was not simply that Bush repeatedly declined to express
either approval of disapproval of the flying of the Confederate
battle flag over the South Carolina state capitol, even when Tim
Russert, interviewing him Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press,''
challenged him by saying: ``Lead!''
</P>
<P>
   It was that Bush met fresh questions about the flag with a
stern, displeased expression and seldom digressed in his answers to
talk about racial tolerance and healing.
</P>
<P>
   The visit to Bob Jones University fell into a similar category,
and it drew intense attention from news organizations that has yet
to let up.
</P>
<P>
   When it predictably came up at the Republican debate on Tuesday,
Bush argued that he had denounced the dating policy, making it
sound as if he had done so in his remarks at the school. In truth,
that stand was taken at a subsequent news conference miles away
from Bob Jones University, and only after a reporter questioned him
intently.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference this week, Bush answered a question about
whether his appearance at the university would hurt him in a
general election by saying that both his father, George Bush, and
Ronald Reagan had visited the school without electoral
repercussions. In other words, the Republican of the future leaned
on logic and examples from the past.
</P>
<P>
   That was also the case in some of his final appeals to
Republicans on the last day before the South Carolina primary.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, he told an audience in Clinton Friday morning,
South Carolina can send a strong message of what our party stands
for?
</P>
<P>
   His next words boiled that position down to two core thoughts,
neither of which spoke to his initial rallying cry of compassionate
conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``A limited government,'' Bush promised, ``and lower taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Those pledges drew vigorous applause. Then again, they would
have elicited the same reaction 10 or 20 years ago.

SHORT ITEM ON BUSINESS DRESS

   Unbuttoning Wall Street &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the elevators at the Goldman Sachs Group and other Wall
Street firms, it is getting easier to pick out the investment
bankers. More often, they are the ones without suits or ties.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Goldman became the latest formerly white-shoe firm to
relax its dress code. Like their counterparts at J.P. Morgan,
Goldman's investment bankers now can dress as they see fit, within
yet-to-be-defined boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The new informality has spread eastward from Silicon Valley,
where financiers and their techno-clients have been dressing down
for years. But not everyone on Wall Street is ready to burn the
suspenders. At some firms, whole departments have declined to
loosen up.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter extended casual Fridays
for its investment bank from summertime to the entire year. But the
people who sell and trade stocks at Morgan Stanley's headquarters
in Times Square are still dressing up every day, year-round. ``It's
up to the discretion of the individual manager,'' a Morgan Stanley
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's stock, bond, currency and commodities departments have
also chosen not to go casual. A Goldman spokeswoman said the
investment bank's switch to ``business casual'' was about making
the bankers and their clients comfortable: ``This is a great way of
making sure people focus on the job at hand and not what they are
wearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Wall Street professionals think the changes will have the
opposite effect. Male bankers accustomed to grabbing a dark suit,
white shirt, print tie and black wingtips in the morning will have
to expend more time making choices. (The impact on Wall Street's
few women is trivial: most switched from power suits to comfortable
slacks, skirts and sweaters years ago.)

ZERO HOUR APPROACHES FOR MICROSOFT, JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, D.C. _ After 21 months of courtroom jousting and
behind-the-scenes mediation, it all comes down to 105 minutes on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At 10 a.m., Microsoft and its antagonists in what some call the
antitrust battle of century will each get their last chance to
offer a lens through which they want District Court Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson to view the facts and law in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The suit pits 19 states and the Department of Justice against
the Redmond software giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parties' core themes and arguments have been spelled out
in mind-numbing detail already, so the main opportunity here is to
crystallize the arguments, to present them in a way that doesn't
jump off the page,'' said Bill Kovacic, a law professor at George
Washington University in Washington, D.C.. ``This can have a great
power to clarify the judge's thinking, to say, `Think about it this
way when you're deciding how to rule'.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 5, Jackson concluded that Microsoft is a monopoly that
abused its power, and that its dominance in personal computer
operating systems has hurt consumers, competitors and computer
makers. Microsoft argues that its actions have been lawful and that
it lacks monopoly power because it faces competition and cannot
unilaterally raise its prices.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's oral arguments could be postponed by news of progress
in the settlement talks that U.S. Circuit Judge Richard Posner has
been leading in Chicago since Nov. 30. Microsoft Chairman Bill
Gates said recently the company would ``do our absolute best'' to
reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Under the mildest proposals being discussed, rules would be
enacted that would change Microsoft's behavior while allowing the
company to keep its present structure. Stronger solutions under
discussion include forcing Microsoft to publish or auction the
source code for Windows _ so other companies could create competing
operating systems _ or breaking up the company. On Thursday, Gates
was quoted by Bloomberg News as saying he would consider disclosing
source code as a way to settle the case. Later Microsoft denied the
statement, while the news agency said it stood by its story.
</P>
<P>
   Barring major settlement news, the states and Justice Department
between them also will get their alotted 105 minutes, 90 minutes
plus 15 minutes to rebut Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely David Boies, Justice's lead attorney, will speak for
the government, Kovacic said. It's not known who will argue for the
states.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft most likely will be represented by lead attorney John
Warden.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will give us the opportunity to articulate the important
points of both fact and law for the judge to focus on,'' said Jim
Cullinan, a Microsoft spokesman. Spokesmen for the Justice
Department and several states didn't respond to requests for
comments.
</P>
<P>
   Once the arguments are concluded, Jackson will retire to begin
work on his decision, formally known as the conclusions of law,
which Kovacic estimated could come down by early April.
</P>
<P>
   After that final legal ruling comes the determination of
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, any outcome can and probably will be appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Strictly speaking, the only proper subject for Tuesday's
arguments is how the federal antitrust laws should be applied to
the facts the judge has found, not what remedy each side favors.
The Justice Department and some states advocate breaking the
company apart, sometimes grimly called ``the death penalty.'' But
the states and Justice aren't known to have agreed on their
recommended remedy, as Jackson has demanded they do.
</P>
<P>
   But ``my guess is the Justice Department will reveal its
preferred remedy'' during the arguments, said Richard McKenzie, a
professor of economics at University of California-Irvine who has
written on the trial. ``And if they're not doing that, they'll
reveal it on the courthouse steps.''

FROM HARD ROCK CAFE TO SPIRITUALITY ON THE WEB
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: David Bloom's weekly Digital L.A. column on the intersection
of technology and entertainment.) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Isaac Tigrett started the Hard Rock Cafe at 22, then followed
that hugely successful Act 1 of his life by founding the House of
Blues, another sterling marriage of music and food and zeitgeist
over which he presided until something of a palace coup left him
pondering the future at the foot of his spiritual master in India.
</P>
<P>
   Now Tigrett has undertaken another business venture that
combines the spirit of the times with filthy lucre and in this
case, real spirituality. Tigrett's new venture, still in its
nascent stages, is called The Spirit Channel.
</P>
<P>
   It ties in with a long-building interest in the Mind, Body &AMP;
Soul Movement, which coalesced in the 1960s in California and
elsewhere around such interests as health food, holistic medicine
and metaphysics.
</P>
<P>
   The spirituality has long been there for Tigrett, reared in tiny
Jackson, Tenn., attending Southern Baptist church services four
times a week. After his folks divorced in the late 1960s, he went
with his father to shagadelic London, where he figured out that
rock 'n' roll was going to be a worldwide cultural phenomenon. He
married music memorabilia, food and marketing savvy to create the
Hard Rock Cafe chain, which soon spread to venues around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, there were little hints of Tigrett's abiding
spiritual interests, such as restaurant walls festooned with such
slogans as ``Love All, Serve All'' and ``Save the Planet.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that sensibility continued with the hugely successful
Sunday gospel brunch series at the House of Blues, and more
personally, by his studies with an Indian spiritual master and his
long-running involvement with New York's non-denominational St.
John the Divine Cathedral, known for its social activism.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years he has worked closely with the cathedral's
retired dean, James Park Morton, who founded the Interfaith Center
of New York and helped organize the Parliament of World Religions.
</P>
<P>
   Tigrett struggled to explain to his friend Morton how
spirituality and the Web could be connected, until one day the
minister had an epiphany.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of sudden, he said, `I know what the Internet is. It's the
body of Christ,''' Tigrett recounted. ``Chills went up my spine. It
is the collective unconsciousness. If there is a God, this is a
divine manifestation for the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet lets people _ such as Parliament of World Religions
participants who communicate with each other on a private network _
understand how much alike they are, Tigrett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sameness is the divinity, the human-ness that ties us all
together,'' Tigrett said. But he's frustrated that the Web's
evolution into a shopping mall and porn palace has done little to
feed ``our higher nature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People became seduced by e-commerce,'' Tigrett said. ``They're
confusing e-commerce with e-culture. It's about community, the
greatest thing to ever bring people together.''
</P>
<P>
   Tigrett is building a virtual ``sacred city'' where like-minded
souls can gather and learn about a broad range of interests, such
as holistic and alternative medical practices, healthful food and
vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, it will feature metaphysics, from astrology to
more obscure practices _ and of course, religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone should start a spiritual site without
religion,'' Tigrett said. ``I looked at those 10 religions
(represented at the Parliament of World Religions) and said,
`That's the whole world culture.' It's the world's music, travel,
books, art.''
</P>
<P>
   He already has launched a very small site, at
www.spiritchannel.com, where you can link to 90 minutes of short
films from the parliament's recent South African gathering and to
The Word Foundation (at www.thewordfoundation.org), which helped
establish the parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to be a guide for people on these journeys,''
Tigrett said. ``It's an opportunity to lead people to the type of
lifestyle they want and need.'' &QL; 
 &QL;

</P>
<P>
   GAMES OF NOTE
</P>
<P>
   I've found some of the notable new game releases for those
who've tired of their Christmas goodies. So just in the nick of
post-St. Nick time, here are some suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   I liked Activision's latest gussying up of a long-time shareware
fave with ``Shanghai Second Dynasty'' for the PC. The title not
only includes handsome variations on the tile-matching game, but a
decent mah-jongg game (whose gorgeous tile designs are used in the
original Shanghai). There's also a children's version in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has a huge winner with its civilization-builder
sequel, Age of Empires II/The Age of Kings. The PC game provides a
ton of options, tough computer opponents, Internet play and simply
gorgeous design.
</P>
<P>
   On the Playstation, I've enjoyed the offbeat adventure Tomba II:
The Evil Swine Return, with its red-haired protagonist and unusual
fighting techniques, and I'm still swimming through the wonders of
Final Fantasy VIII, the definitive role-playing game (a PC version
is now available).
</P>
<P>
   For a platform game likely to appeal to younger players, you
might try a weekend rental of The Smurfs, from Infogrames. My
7-year-old devoured it.
</P>
<P>
   On Dreamcast (and Playstation and N64), I have loved Vigilante 8
Second Offense, the sequel to the hugely popular sci-fi car combat
game. They've kept much of that Vig8 fun while adding such touches
as nasty nonplayer characters and powerups that allow you to drive
across water, snow and swamps. It's just plain fun.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nintendo 64, Mario Party 2 is another great title for a
roomful of kids. It plays best when three or four children are
going at each other, with a boardgame-like interface that leads to
64 different kinds of mini-games. This is a perfect solution when
the cousins visit some rainy weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Among the flurry of new Game Boy titles, I've particularly loved
Wings of Fury, a revived arcade and NES game whose charms are
undiminished. You fly a World War II fighter-bomber from the deck
of a wounded carrier you're escorting to base for repairs. The game
deserves a Distinguished Flying Fun Cross. &QL;

 &HT;    First Nielsen NetRatings say workplace is favored surfing spot
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner and Frances Katz

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At the Atlanta recruiting firm of Focus Enterprises
Inc., workers have been known to buy and sell cars, shop for golf
clubs and book flights _ all online, all on company time and
without so much as a sideways glance from boss Ray Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not opposed to folks spending time on the Internet for
personal reasons, as long as they keep focused on their job,'' said
Collins, vice president of operations at the 10-person firm.
Collins spends time online himself. Last year, he used the Web to
comparison shop before buying his 1999 Buick Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   ``It saved me a lot of time and legwork.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Just this week, Nielsen/NetRatings, in its first
detailed look at how workers use the Internet, found that, during
the month of January, the average employee with Internet access
spent 21 hours a week online, more than double the time spent by
Internet users at home.
</P>
<P>
   At work, the number of Internet users was less than half as many
as at home, but they spent twice the time there and logged on twice
as many times. There are roughly 30.6 million wired employees, as
opposed to some 77 million in the home, according to
Nielsen/NetRatings. Yet, Internet users at work logged on 41 times
during the month, compared to an average of 18 times for at-home
users. Once online, workers spent time on financial information,
news and computer electronics shopping sites, with entertainment
and media showing up in fourth place.
</P>
<P>
   What the Nielsen study seems to show is that, whether it's
buying books or toys, booking a vacation, tracking stocks or news,
time-strapped workers have embraced the Internet as they look for
ways to squeeze as much time and work out of their day. And for the
wired employee, the workplace will never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are distinct differences between the behavior of at-work
and at-home
</P>
<P>
   Internet users,'' said Allen Weiner, vice president of
analytical services at
</P>
<P>
   NetRatings. ``While keeping close tabs on the financial markets
is important
</P>
<P>
   for the at-work surfer, the at-home user may prefer to play
games and chat
</P>
<P>
   online at Pogo or Rivals.''
</P>
<P>
   Doing home work at work is just easier because the connections
are faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things that are done at home are done at work more quickly and
efficiently,'' he said. ``People who use the Internet at work for
fun aren't goof-offs. The average employee spends at least eight
hours a day in the workplace, maybe more. What they do at work
takes a lot of their time, and they also do things like make
personal phone calls, pay bills and phone stores to see if a
certain product is in stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web affords an ease of use and efficiency,'' Weiner said.
``Think about it. If you were an employer, would you rather have
someone sitting at their desk spending 40 minutes writing bills, or
would you rather have them spend 10 minutes doing it online?''
</P>
<P>
   The point is, the Internet makes doing home work at work a lot
easier, but it also makes doing the employer's work easier and
faster, too. The Nielsen/NetRating study shows that, although
workers spend a lot of time on Amazon and eBay, much of their
Internet shopping time is spent at Staples and Office Max sites, or
on sites that offer computer equipment for sale. Few home users
show up on these sites. Presumably, the time is spent doing work.
</P>
<P>
   Productivity among American workers is at record levels and
economists lay some of that success at the door of the Internet.
Employers are encouraging workers to use the Internet by putting
quick access to health care benefits, payroll information and even
discount, company-endorsed coupons for certain products to be
purchased online.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, this newfound free online access is raising
concern in corporate America: Should we keep tabs on workers' time
online?
</P>
<P>
   An American Management Association study in December found that
nearly half _ 46 percent _ of the 1,139 U.S. firms surveyed said
they track employees' use of the office Internet, and another 12
percent said they plan to do so soon. Sixty four percent said they
have written policies regarding personal use of the Internet, and
13 percent said they plan to implement an Internet policy.
</P>
<P>
   As for disciplinary measures, 36 percent of the companies had
punished a worker for misusing the Internet, and 11 percent had
fired a worker for Internet abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the real world, if someone logs on to a movie theater to
find out what time the next show is playing, companies are likely
to shrug that off,'' said Eric Rolfe Greenberg of the American
Management Association in New York. ``But if such Internet
connections are long, hour after hour to sites that are not
business-related, then disciplinary actions is taken.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, companies are enlisting the help of other companies
to coral employees' online addiction or abuse. Firms such as
WebSense have developed software to help employers track workers'
Internet activities, which is expected to grow substantially in the
future. There is software available that will let companies block
employees from entering certain areas such as entertainment or
shopping sites.
</P>
<P>
   The number of workers making online purchases from the office
will increase in the next six to 18 months as online retailers make
ordering faster and easier, say analysts at Jupiter Communications,
an independent Internet research firm.
</P>
<P>
   As more companies add more computers with high-speed Web access,
workplace Web surfing is bound to increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one of those things that happens every decade or so
which overwhelms the office so rapidly that people go one of two
ways with it,'' said Greenberg. ``They either feel like `how did we
ever get along without it,' or people fool around with it, which
creates productivity problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of mouth or ``viral marketing'' has helped spur the growth
of e-commerce at work, said NetRatings' Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   ``People use their secondary mailboxes at work, for the personal
mail, in addition to the company's e-mail system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An employee's personal mailbox may contain special offers or
promotions
</P>
<P>
   from online retailers they've shopped with in the past. When
they get the
</P>
<P>
   offer at work, they are likely to take action on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are taking action on them in the workplace. It's making
the workplace a place where people take action,'' Weiner said.
``The way we know this is that we know what sites people go to
before and after they visit a retail site and it's typically
something like (personal e-mail providers) yahoo.com, or
hotmail.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not all this online shopping, banking and planning is
keeping people from doing what they're paid to do is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't answer if it's affected productivity,'' said
Collins. However, he said, ``It beats jumping in the car and
running over to the travel agent or the bank.''

GOVERNOR SCRAMBLES TO CALM FUROR OVER HIGHWAY PROJECT 
</HEADLINE>
 LEAD-WRITETHROUGH  
 (Eds: Restores dropped words in second paragraph)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Governor Paul Cellucci scrambled Friday to assure
federal highway authorities that the state can find a way to cover
the $1.4 billion cost overrun for the massive road project known as
the Big Dig.
</P>
<P>
   In swift succession, Cellucci filed legislation outlining his
financing plan, asked for cooperation from the powerful speaker of
the state House, Thomas M. Finneran, and called on US Senator
Edward M. Kennedy to act as an intermediary between Massachusetts
and federal officials who have threatened to cut off future funding
for the $12.2 billion project.
</P>
<P>
   While his efforts may have been expected, given the stern
warning from Washington, the language of the governor's bill was
not. It left out one key aspect of the proposal he had announced
earlier in the week, toll increases.
</P>
<P>
   Observers believe Cellucci removed the controversial issue of
tolls to make the package more likely to win approval from
legislators before March 15, the deadline by which federal
officials say Massachusetts needs to have a financing plan in
place.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as federal auditors prepare to descend on Boston to
scrutinize the project next week, James J. Kerasiotes, who presides
over the Big Dig, privately told high-level officials working on
the funding crisis in Washington that he believes he may lose his
job, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerasiotes, the chairman of the Massachusetts Turnpike
Authority, is nervously awaiting the auditors, who are seeking
answers about contracts that have swelled in price and asking
Kerasiotes did not let highway officials know about the shortfall
sooner, an issue that angered US Transportation Secretary Rodney E.
Slater as much as the funding crisis itself, said those familiar
with the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Federal Highway Authority in Boston and
Washington did not return calls seeking comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Slater issued a statement threatening to halt Big
Dig funding unless the state devises an acceptable plan to pay for
the recently announced $1.4 billion gap.
</P>
<P>
   Slater also warned that there could be ``changes in
leadership,'' a remark that sources believe could be aimed at Peter
C. Markle, the regional Federal Highway administrator who oversees
how the agency's funding is spent in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next week he could get fired,'' said one Big Dig source about
the arrival of federal auditors.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, members of the congressional delegation downplayed
threats by the Federal Highway Authority to cut off funding, saying
that Washington has invested too much in the project to walk away
from the enormous construction site under the city. But they
believe the highway authority wants Massachusetts to demonstrate
that it can cover the cost overrun.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci appears to be moving intently to restore the faith of
federal highway officials. In adddition to his legislation, which
calls for $1 billion in borrowing, the governor said he would move
immediately to cash in part of a controversial insurance policy,
which would raise $150 million. He said he will also order the
Turnpike Authority to contribute $200 million in cash and sell some
real estate, although no specifics were available Friday night.
Those actions do not require legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released late Friday, Cellucci said fare
increases in the harbor tunnels and eastern points on the turnpike
were ``still under discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Cellucci has said that he did not want to impose higher
tolls in January, a year earlier than scheduled, the $60 million
the tolls would generate were part of his initial financing
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   If the increases are implemented, tolls between Route 128 and
Boston would jump from 50 cents to $1, and tunnel fees would
increase from $2 to $3 for cars and $3 to $5 for cabs.
</P>
<P>
   However, Cellucci appeared to be backing off Friday, after
Finneran said he was opposed to the hikes.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran, who met with Cellucci at the State House Friday
morning, said the House ``would not be reflexively critical of the
(governor's) plan but would reserve rights to scrutinize or modify
it.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, the speaker left the door open for a House plan,
which requires a bigger cash contribution from the Turnpike
Authority and the use of driver's license fees to leverage $600
million in state bonds.
</P>
<P>
   However, Finneran did signal willingness to reach an agreement
quickly. ``We should not lose sight of the importance of the
project,'' Finneran said. ``It's important to keep the work
continuing and the project moving ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to restore political calm as legislators review
his plan, Cellucci is relying on Kennedy to act as an intermediary
between the State House and Slater, hoping the diplomatic senior
senator can use his White House connections to calm the
transportation chief's outrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thrust is, they want to calm everything down,'' said one
source close to Kennedy.

AFI HONORS HARRISON FORD
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The one thing his colleagues could agree upon was that
Hollywood's top action star Harrison Ford is a little grumpy. At
least those were the stories told as the American Film Institute
presented Ford with its 28th Life Achievement Award.
</P>
<P>
   In a generally lighthearted affair, the star of the Indiana
Jones, ``Star Wars'' and Jack Ryan movies, as well as such
acclaimed films as ``Blade Runner,'' ``The Fugitive'' and
``Witness,'' was praised and joshed by an eclectic assortment of
colleagues Thursday night. They included Sharon Stone, Brad Pitt,
Carrie Fisher and three of Ford's best-known directors: George
Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Mike Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation was kicked off by Ford's biggest co-star of
all: Chewbacca, Han Solo's hairy Wookie sidekick from the first
``Star Wars'' trilogy. As that indicates, serious cinematic
discourse was not high on the agenda for the black-tie gala at the
Beverly Hilton Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Known for his taciturn, sometimes grumpy but always creatively
engaged and unpretentious personality, Ford heard a lot of
``He-don't-say-much'' jokes from the podium. Lucas recalled how,
during his first meeting with the then-Hollywood carpenter for a
part in ``American Graffiti,'' neither of the shy men did much more
than grunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great meeting!'' Lucas fondly noted.
</P>
<P>
   The much more talkative Fisher launched numerous witty zingers
at her ``Star Wars'' co-star's strong, silent, ultra-masculine
screen persona before confessing, ``I was obsessed with Harrison
before it became fashionable.''
</P>
<P>
   And Spielberg, looking energetic and none the worse for his
recent kidney operation, noted that when it comes to the work, his
Indiana Jones star is anything but tongue-tied.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first words out of Harrison's mouth were, `I've got a lot
of ideas about this script,''' Spielberg said of their initial
``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Reticent in a much humbler manner while accepting the award that
puts him in the company of screen legends ranging from Alfred
Hitchcock to Jack Nicholson, Ford, his head bowed, softly thanked
the AFI and collaborators who have made him look good over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight ... you have made me laugh,'' he concluded. ``Now I'm
gonna get the hell out of here before you make me cry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The 2000 AFI's Life Achievement Award Salute to Harrison
Ford'' will be broadcast on CBS in the spring. &QL;

OLD WOUNDS: S.C. FINDS CONFEDERATE FLAG ISSUE IN SPOTLIGHT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ARMANDO VILLAFRANCA 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Anne Powell's family memories are both precious
and painful and as deeply hued as the Confederate battle flag she
loves so well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised on nursery rhymes, but I was also raised on these
stories my mother told me,'' said Powell, 73, a member of the
United Daughters of the Confederacy. They were stories about her
grandfather, who carried the wounded of the 21st South Carolina
regiment from Civil War battlefields and of her grandmother who as
a teen-ager witnessed the Yankee ransacking of homes in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joe Darby, 48, also has memories, more scars than
recollections, and they are embodied in the same flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the flag that politicians used to stand in front of to
defend segregation,'' he said. ``That's the flag that Klansmen used
to carry down the street when I was a little boy in Columbia when
they had their rallies on the Statehouse grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the flag that the University of South Carolina
policeman had on his shoulder when I was 14 years old and he kicked
me off the Carolina campus and told me don't bring your black ass
here any more unless you got on a green (janitor's) uniform,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Like many people in this historic state, Darby and Powell stand
on opposite sides of a great, emotional divide. Legal remedies and
economic progress have wiped clear segregation and partition. But
flapping atop the state Capitol is the flag of another era. And the
sight of it taps raw emotions evoking equal measures of pride and
anger.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls show 52 percent of South Carolinians want the flag
taken down while 37 percent support keeping it in place.
</P>
<P>
   The flag was raised on state capitols throughout the South in
1962 as part of the centennial celebration of the Civil War to
honor the fallen. But the flag also symbolized the South's defiance
in the face of imposing civil rights legislation. Eventually, the
flag was lowered from every Southern state capitol, except in South
Carolina. The first state to secede in 1860 and the site of the
opening salvos of the war, South Carolina has remained defiant.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the flag preserves their heritage and symbolizes
the honor and sacrifices offered in defense of the Southern cause
in the war. For opponents, the flag conjures up images of slavery
and serves only to preserve white supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is that this is not just an argument over one
particular flag over one particular building down here in South
Carolina,'' said Christopher Kelly Sullivan, executive director of
the Southern Heritage Association, a leading supporter of the
movement to keep the flag flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an attempt to wholesale remove all Southern symbols
and our concern is if we give in here, ... they will just become
even more demanding and even more vigorous in their attempts to get
rid of public displays of Southern heritage and that memory will be
lost forever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political debate is over the flag's location, but the real
intellectual debate is over the principles and the ideas behind the
flag.''
</P>
<P>
   W. Marvin Dulaney, executive director of the Avery Research
Center for African-American Studies at the College of Charleston,
said the flag stands as an affront to every black in the country
and remains as one of the Old South's last symbols.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are actually trying to cling to the way things used to
be, and, in fact, I'll just put it out there: They are basically
trying to cling to white supremacy,'' Dulaney said.
</P>
<P>
   Darby says any African-American who grew up in South Carolina,
or anywhere else in the South, knows without question what the flag
represents.
</P>
<P>
   Dulaney said the controversy is particularly disturbing to
blacks in a state where memorials to the Confederate fallen far
outnumber those of civil rights leaders, which are virtually
nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Of the state's population of 3.8 million in 1998, about 30
percent are black.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, the observance of the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr.'s birthday is not a mandatory state holiday but is optional,
along with the birthdays of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee and
Confederate President Jefferson Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Parents also have the option of keeping their children from
participating in any activities associated with black history in
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Though most urban centers in America have streets named after
King, Charleston does not. No monuments honor blacks or civil
rights leaders in Charleston or Columbia. The only landmark in or
near Charleston that cites the state's black history is a marker on
Sullivan Island noting the disembarkation point of slaves brought
from Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just found there was a general hostility to anything that
would acknowledge African-American history or acknowledge the
racial history of the state,'' Dulaney said. ``The Civil War just
didn't seem to have ended at all. The Civil War is still going on
in South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People launched an all-out assault on South Carolina's
insistence on keeping the flag flying over the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP initiated a boycott of the state's tourism industry
that went into effect Jan. 1, asking supporters to stay away until
the flag is lowered. In 1999, tourism generated $14.1 billion for
the state.
</P>
<P>
   As of last week, 95 events representing $7 million were canceled
as a direct result of the boycott, according to the state Parks,
Recreation and Tourism Department.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Volz of the Columbia Metropolitan Convention and Visitor's
Bureau said the city has suffered 26 cancellations representing a
$2.6 million loss to the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   The number of cancellations, he believes, would have been
greater had organizers not paid deposits for their events.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word we're getting is, `We think you're a delightful place
but until you get that flag thing resolved we won't think of it,'''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several compromises to end the controversy have been proposed,
including one announced Monday by South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges.
His plan would remove the Confederate flag from the Capitol dome
and House and Senate chambers. The plan also would put the flag of
the Army of Northern Virginia _ a square version of the flag _ on a
pole beside a statue of Confederate Gen. Wade Hampton, who also was
a former senator and governor.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a group of legislators proposed moving the flag to
the Confederate soldier's memorial on Statehouse grounds, but the
NAACP rejected the compromise.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, state Sen. Robert Ford introduced a compromise bill
that called for removing the flag and establishing a black heritage
monument. The state Senate passed the bill, but the House blocked
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Until last month, the issue was mainly contained within South
Carolina, gaining only a sprinkling of national attention, even
after 46,000 marched on the state Capitol on MLK Day. But national
attention intensified after the arrival of candidates in the
state's Saturday presidential primary, the first in the South.
</P>
<P>
   At Charleston's historic marketplace, vendors skirt the issue as
deftly as politicians, weighing how their opinions may impact their
livelihoods. Amid the galleries and trendy restaurants, the
controversy garners hardly a scant mention. Confederate flags are
mainly found in Civil War memorabilia shops.
</P>
<P>
   But the strongest and most vocal opinions have come from
lifelong South Carolinians, for whom the past remains alive. For
them, their only interest is their pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my chapter group the other day I said, `Now, I can't
expect each one of you to feel as strongly as I do,''' said Powell.
``But I said, `You might not think so, but if that flag comes down
your life's gonna change.'''
</P>
<P>
   In an antique-furnished parlor in her Florence, S.C., home,
Powell proudly shows a guest a photo of her Christmas tree,
decorated with cotton bolls and dozens of tiny Confederate battle
flags.
</P>
<P>
   Powell calls herself an unreconstructed Southerner and fully
admits she may be holding on too tightly to a long-gone South, not
the genteel world of blooming magnolias, but a more recent time
when people knew their station in life without having to be told.
</P>
<P>
   Powell's mother was 53 when she gave birth to her, and her
grandparents died before she was born. But the memories of the Old
South were kept alive through the stories she heard about the war
and Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never said Civil War. It wasn't allowed in our house, and I
don't allow it in mine now. You can either say the War Between the
States or the War of the Confederate Independence or you can even
say the War of Northern Aggression,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In describing her feelings about the Confederacy and how her
sentiments may be considered outdated, she likened the experience
to a memory she has of a spinster aunt who lived with her family
and died in 1959. When the aunt was near death, she told Powell she
felt like she had stepped over into another world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know exactly how she feels now,'' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   For Darby, who grew up during the civil rights movement and
witnessed the crashing of worlds as represented by the
transformation from the Old to the New South, he has never seen
anything galvanize the black community in South Carolina as
intensely as the flag issue.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation, he said, is that South Carolina did not
experience the racial turmoil that came with the civil rights
movement in other Southern states. He said blacks in South Carolina
are now making up for lost time and collecting old debts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mississippi, Alabama had some horrific struggles, violent
struggles, but the by-product of that is that it had a cathartic
effect. They were able to look back at all of those struggles; they
had shared them as citizens and were able to grow from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Carolina desegregated with very little fanfare, very
quietly. It was a very polite process that met the legal standard
but it never did get into the emotions. For the past 30, 40 years,

 &HT;    Bush tries new approach on S.C. voters
 &HT;    By Jena Heath and Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLINTON, S.C. _ Gov. George W. Bush today gets his first glimpse
into the political looking glass to see what the voters think of
his makeover.
</P>
<P>
   In the week leading up to today's crucial South Carolina
primary, Bush has been working the voters in groups as well as
individually as he takes their questions at ``one-on-one''
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Many questioners, especially those already on the Bush team, go
away happy. But some of the undecideds _ the group that could
determine today's outcome _ leave not quite satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't close the sale, but he is moving there,'' Allene
Sonntag of Hilton Head said after Bush gave a somewhat windy answer
to her question about what can be done about ``filth'' produced by
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   If South Carolinians like the Bush who showed up here, he could
turn around a campaign that took a direct hit from Arizona Sen.
John McCain in New Hampshire on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But a loss could snowball into defeats in Arizona and Michigan
on Tuesday. If that happens, the former prohibitive frontrunner is
sure to hear some calls for him to get out of the race, something
he said Friday is not going to happen anytime soon under any
scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by three polls showing him leading here, Bush proclaimed
that his new, looser style _ a shorter, smoother stump speech and
more time for audience questions _ is hitting the mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a little warmer for starters, if you know what I
mean,'' Bush said Friday when asked why things will go better for
him here than they did in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   He said the re-tooled format ``has given me a chance to become
more engaged with the voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens here, perfecting spontaneity remains a
challenge for Bush. Though he is a champion at off-stage banter
with voters, he doesn't always score with folks who ask him
questions while he is center-stage. He frequently seeks refuge in
his stump speech, offering up sections of it in response to
questions _ even if it is not quite on-target with the question.
</P>
<P>
   He can be particularly uncomfortable with nuanced questions,
those that ask him to look inward or to empathize with the intimate
and often painful details of other peoples' lives.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a woman told Bush that she and her husband need
better medical coverage to help their son, who is suffering from a
life-threatening illness. Bush launched into a policy discussion
about medical savings accounts before drifting to a close:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry, obviously,'' he told the woman. ``I wish I could
wave a wand.''
</P>
<P>
   Conor Twomey, 33, a Myrtle Beach contractor, asked Bush how he
reconciles his Christian beliefs with his support for the death
penalty. Bush repeated his oft-stated position that he believes
capital punishment saves lives by preventing murders, and he
believes everybody executed under his watch has been guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``He failed to answer the question because I asked him, as a
Christian, how could he justify his stance on the death penalty,''
Twomey said. ``As a Christian, I would have expected him to refer
to the Bible...He didn't answer the question. He just gave his
opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Twomey said he will vote for McCain even though McCain supports
the death penalty, too.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Bush can barely hide his frustration with persistent
questioners. When Samuel T. Ross-Lee, an African American pastor,
pressed him on the contentious issue of whether South Carolina
should continue to fly the Confederate flag over its Capitol, Bush
asked him if he was a member of the news media and eventually told
him to sit down.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has declined to offer an opinion on the topic, saying it is
for South Carolinians to decide.
</P>
<P>
   After the tense discussion between Bush and the pastor, friends
Melanie Reel and Heather Fletcher said they might not vote for Bush
because of the way he treated Ross-Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Bush to tell him to sit down really bothered me,'' Reel
said. ``The way he asked the question was very clear and I don't
think Bush was being very clear in his answer.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Bush campaign plane Friday, Laura Bush, the candidate's
wife, said she is not convinced voters are getting an accurate read
on her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I should say it this way, the people who know George the
best, Texans who know him the best, all the governors that know him
the best, like him the most,'' she said.''And I'm not really sure
that's what the American public sees right now in the newspaper and
on television.''
</P>
<P>
   In person, many South Carolinians have screamed their support
and others have not liked all they have heard but plan to back him
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Poston said he believes Bush is morally upright.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, he didn't give the answer I wanted for one area,''
Poston said. ``I support a minimum wage increase and I could tell
he's not. On the moral side of it, I'm definitely for that. I will
be voting for Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many South Carolina voters this week, David Harper was
still deciding whose answers he liked best. The steel company
retiree wanted to know what Bush would do to bring down oil and gas
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain has said a lot of things that I like but so has Bush,''
Harper said. ``I heard McCain two weeks ago. Now I heard Bush and
now I got to weigh the difference and let it go over in my mind and
see which one I think is best for the office.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Bush's presidential campaign, costing a record $50
million so far, hangs in the balance of indecision of voters like
Harper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect about everybody has made up their mind in South
Carolina,'' Bush said Friday. ``Now it's time to get out the
vote.''

A TREND THE WNBA SHOULD IGNORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The dream is always the same.
</P>
<P>
   There is this big room. And there are all these lights, cameras
... and all these people.
</P>
<P>
   At the front of the room, behind this big desk, sits this
faceless woman. I can never hear what she says in the beginning; I
only pick it up when she starts with ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I am foregoing my final year of eligibility at Connecticut to
enter the WNBA draft,'' she says. ``I only really came here for the
basketball anyway. With the money I will earn from basketball I
hope to put my little sister through college, maybe buy a car ...
and set up my posse real good.''
</P>
<P>
   It's at this moment I wake up in a cold sweat. I look up at my
Reggie Miller poster and ask, ``Tell me that the mindset that
pervades men's college basketball hasn't permeated to the allegedly
pure game of the women?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Reggie never answers. Some poster.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the question and the fear is legitimate; the day seems
to be coming when a women's college basketball player opts to dump
higher education for higher financing.
</P>
<P>
   As of today, it's never been done before. There was some
scuttlebutt that former Tennessee star Chamique Holdsclaw could
have pulled it off. But, she had coach Pat Summitt in her way.
Dennis Rodman has a better chance of getting David Stern into the
ring than a Lady Vol has of leaving school early under Summitt's
watch.
</P>
<P>
   One day this is going to happen, but we are a long way from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think until the money gets better it won't happen,'' TCU
senior women's administrator Marcy Girton said. ``It sounds cliche,
but there are so many people who got into \Rwomen's sports\S
because they believe in the intrinsic values of sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those values have to do with education. For so long, if
you wanted to play women's basketball at the professional level,
you went to Europe or beyond. Regardless, you still earned your
degree.
</P>
<P>
   But, as television continues to become a bigger factor in
women's sports, and the WNBA becomes more secure in its respective
cities, and in sports culture, there will come a day when a woman
challenges the league's stance on underclassmen. Right now, a
player must earn a degree or play four years of college basketball
before she is eligible. This rule has as much weight as Calista
Flockhart.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a player's standpoint it's changed,'' Gerdt said. ``They
are watching it on television, and they see the glory and want to
go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   When they watch TV, what do they see? If they are watching the
WNBA, players who most likely graduated and who are earning a good,
but not exorbitant, salary.
</P>
<P>
   If they are watching the NBA, which is what its younger sister
aspires to be, they see high school kids and college dropouts
cashing in on long jumpers and missed free throws while preaching,
``Stay in school ... even though I didn't.'' MARQUETTE FINALLY
ABOUT TO GAIN SOME ATTENTION
</P>
<P>
   It's not totally uncommon for senior Abbie Willenborg to be
stopped in airports along with the rest of her teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you a women's basketball team?'' is the first question
posed of the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' they reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, you must be from Michigan,'' is the second part.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but the MU on their warmups doesn't stand for the
Michigan Wolverines. It's for the Marquette Eagles. But Willenborg
and the rest of her team shouldn't sweat the identity crisis too
much longer.
</P>
<P>
   Trying for their fourth consecutive 20-victory season, the
Eagles (16-4, 8-1 in Conference USA) cracked the Top 25 this week
for the first time in school history at No. 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different in the past in that this team has taken it upon
themselves to get the national recognition,'' said Willenborg, who
averages 16.2 points and 9.2 rebounds. ``At lot of times we didn't
get it, but we were doing everything to be ranked, but we weren't.
We took it personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Willenborg acknowledges that there are more teams like the
Eagles out there _ she mentions Drake chief amongst them _ but that
the national exposure has put Marquette on a plateau sometimes
unseen in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always joke about how we feel the University of Wisconsin
gets more attention no matter what, even in Milwaukee,'' Willenborg
said. ``But, we have made the tournament the past three years and
we hope to put ourselves in a position to host \Ra sub-regional\S.
That would be a great ending.'' WANTING A TOURNAMENT
</P>
<P>
   With the chances of the Pac-10 winner having four losses for the
first time ever, coaches are beginning to push for a conference
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the Pac-10 is the only major conference without a
postseason tournament. A committee is studying a proposal that
could recommend a tournament _ independent of the men _ to start in
2002.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, UCLA and Stanford are opposed to reviving the men's
tournament, which received mediocre support from 1987-90. Stanford
women's coach Tara VanDerveer, who is the only coach who opposes
the tournament, concedes she would do it if every other school
concurs.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest conference power ratings, the Pac-10 ranks seventh
nationally. The move toward a tournament would mean a reduced
conference schedule and allow more non-conference games to boost
ratings and the potential to send more teams to the NCAA
Tournament. THE MAILWOMAN
</P>
<P>
   Taking a slight detour on his way to Oakland, Calif., for the
NBA All-Star game, Utah Jazz forward Karl Malone stopped in Ruston,
La., for a women's basketball game. His daughter, 6-foot-2 freshman
Cheryl Ford of Louisiana Tech, made her first start in the Lady
Techster's 89-62 victory against Florida International.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice having my father see me play, but I was more
nervous about starting,'' said Ford, who finished with eight
rebounds, three blocks and 10 points on 5-for-9 shooting. END OF A
STREAK
</P>
<P>
   Kansas' 79-71 victory at No. 10 Iowa State on Wednesday ended
the Cyclones' 26-game home winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ISU lost at home for the first time since March 16, 1998, when
it was beaten by Rutgers, 62-61, in the second round of the NCAA
Tournament. The Cyclones had not lost a regular-season game at home
since a 76-52 setback to Nebraska on Jan. 30, 1997. INSIDE THE
NUMBERS
</P>
<P>
   13-3: Stanford's record since a 2-3 start.
</P>
<P>
   4: Concussions suffered by UCLA sophomore Michelle Greco in her
career; she could miss the rest of the season as a result of the
latest one.
</P>
<P>
   29 Average margin of victory for No. 4 Louisiana Tech, tops in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   6-2: Alabama's record in games decided by five points or less.
</P>
<P>
   1988: The last time Auburn won at Alabama before its 69-59
victory against the Crimson Tide on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   24: Consecutive seasons that Tennessee has recorded at least 20

CONTROVERSIES ARE NO BARRIER TO INVESTORS IN BIOTECH SHARES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Calif. Mass.)  (rk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When 18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger died last September in a gene
therapy experiment that went awry, shares of Cell Genesys Inc., a
gene therapy company, were selling for about $8. Now they are
selling for more than $30. Avigen Inc., another gene therapy
company, has zoomed from about $11 to $66. And Targeted Genetics
has increased tenfold from less than $2 to more than $20.
</P>
<P>
   Gelsinger's death has cast a harsh spotlight on gene therapy,
raising questions about whether patient safeguards were neglected
in the quest for profits. The result could be tighter regulations
or even, in the worst case for the industry, a public backlash
similar to what is starting to occur against genetically modified
foods.
</P>
<P>
   But investors hardly seem to care. Shares of virtually all
companies involved in gene therapy have climbed sharply since the
controversy arose. Wall Street seems to be betting that the
repercussions will be confined to the University of Pennsylvania,
where Gelsinger was treated, and to the particular technology used
in his case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people have really focused on it, to be
honest,'' Meg Malloy, an analyst with Chase H&AMP; Q, said of the
controversy. ``I don't think it will create serious barriers. I do
think it will slow things down for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at several gene therapy companies said that while
they are keeping a wary eye on Washington, the controversy has not
affected their companies. ``We're really not influenced by what's
going on at this time,'' said Stephen A. Sherwin, chairman and
chief executive of Cell Genesys.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the rise in gene therapy stocks is the investor frenzy
for all of biotechnology, which is suddenly being viewed as the
next big thing after the Internet. The Nasdaq biotechnology index
has doubled since the end of September. ``We have a halo effect
around biotech right now,'' said Kurt von Emster, portfolio manager
of the Franklin Biotechnology Discovery Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest stocks have been those of companies involved in
deciphering the human genetic code. Gene therapy has basked in the
fringes of this glow because once disease-causing genes are found,
there will be more opportunities to inject corrective genes into
people as therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Even if there were no controversy, the current investor
enthusiasm for gene therapy would be surprising. Gene therapy has
been the black sheep of the biotechnology industry because it
hasn't really cured anyone in more than 300 clinical trials over 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   But now there are glimmers of progress. Avigen reported recently
that gene therapy tested on three people with hemophilia had
reduced the amount of blood-clotting drugs they had to take.
Avigen, based in Alameda, Calif., is planning to sell more stock to
the public, a sign that it is not overly concerned about events in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy has swirled around whether University of
Pennsylvania scientists fully informed Gelsinger, who suffered from
a rare hereditary disease, about the risks of the treatment. Safety
questions have focused on the adenovirus, a weakened cold virus,
that was used to carry the genes into Gelsinger's liver.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few other clinical trials seem to have been directly
affected so far. The Food and Drug Administration temporarily
suspended enrollment of new patients into two gene therapy trials
for liver cancer run by the Schering-Plough Corp. that used an
approach similar to the Penn study. But that suspension was lifted
in December. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston earlier
this month halted a hemophilia trial financed by Transkaryotic
Therapies Inc. because of the controversy, even though the trial
was not using adenoviruses.
</P>
<P>
   But Schering-Plough is such a big company that the delay of two
trials would have little effect on its stock. Transkaryotic
Therapies is a small, publicly traded company, but gene therapy is
not its main attraction for investors. Other companies using
adenovirus, such as Genovo and Genvec, are privately held.
</P>
<P>
   The one public gene therapy company that does inject
adenoviruses into patients is Collateral Therapeutics of San Diego,
which is using gene therapy to try to grow blood vessels as an
alternative to bypass surgery in treating heart disease.
Collateral's stock has been erratic and has risen from $17 at the
end of September to $33 now, a smaller rise than the other gene
therapy stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of the company were said to be in Germany and could
not be reached for comment. But von Emster, whose fund owns shares
in the company, said the stock is now rising because investors are
anticipating that the company will release data in a few months
showing that its approach is effective. ``Investors are more
concerned with whether the treatment works than whether the trial
is safe,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Targeted Genetics, Vical Inc. and Avigen, do not use the
adenovirus and have managed to distance themselves from the
controversy. To some extent the current controversy has vindicated
their choice of technologies. ``They have in a funny sort of way
benefited,'' said James McCamant, publisher of the Medical
Technology Stock Letter.
</P>
<P>
   Vical Inc., based in San Diego, injects genes without putting
them into any kind of virus. When the company met with investors
last month prior to issuing new shares to the public, it was
peppered with questions about the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept telling them, `Can you spell nonviral?''' said Alain B.
Schreiber, president and chief executive. Vical ended up raising
$125 million, twice as much as it expected.
</P>
<P>
   Targeted Genetics and Avigen use adeno-associated viruses, which
they say are not known to be harmful. Cell Genesys does use
adenovirus in efforts to treat lung cancer but it injects the
viruses into tumor cells outside the body, which the company says
is a safer technique. Cell Genesys shares have been driven up by
the mushrooming in value of its minority stake in Abgenix, a
biotechnology company not involved in gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while investors seem to be drawing a distinction between
the different techniques of gene therapy, regulators, politicians
and the general public might not. There is already talk of
expanding the investigation to trials that used other techniques
aside from adenoviruses. And new regulations might cover all gene
therapy.

   ISRAEL: NETANYAHU INQUIRY
</P>
<P>
   The police are expected to recommend prosecution of Benjamin
Netanyahu, the former prime minister, when they end their
investigation of bribery and theft allegations soon. Netanyahu's
lawyer, Yaakov Weinroth, accused the police of bad faith in leaking
their inclination before the investigation was finished. ``Even if
Moses himself comes along now and says these things never happened,
the way this investigation was conducted, it wouldn't mean

   ISRAEL: PISSARRO HANDED BACK
</P>
<P>
   The Israel Museum is returning ownership of a painting by
Camille Pissarro to the heir of a German Holocaust victim, Max
Silberburg, who held its title. ``Boulevard Montmartre: Spring,''
which is considered one of the finest in a series that Pissarro
painted in 1897, will remain at the museum in a loan agreement with
the heir, Gerta Silberberg. A plaque explains the journey of the
painting, which was forcibly sold at auction in 1935 in Berlin,
from Silberburg, an industrialist and collector, to the Jerusalem

FIXING THE MARRIAGE PENALTY

<P>
   When the Senate next month takes up a measure addressing the
so-called marriage tax penalty, it will have to do a better job
than the House if it is to avoid President Clinton's veto. The
House has gone too far in its effort, shedding revenue that has
nothing to do with inequalities in the treatment of single and
married taxpayers. While no perfect solution is possible, a fairer
version should be crafted.
</P>
<P>
   Some couples, but not all, find they must pay more tax on their
combined income after marrying than they would as single payers.
For the most part, these are two-worker couples with approximately
the same incomes. Couples with most of the income earned by one
partner actually have lower taxes after marriage. And the bulk of
low-income couples _ less than $30,000 a year _ have no change in
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The glaring feature of the current system is the standard
deduction _ $4,300 for an individual but $7,200 for a married
couple, an increase of only two thirds rather than double. Most
proposals, including the House version, would double the standard
increase, which is reasonable, though in reality living costs for a
couple are not apt to be double those of an individual for items
like housing and transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The House attempted to compensate couples who itemize their
deductions (rather than using the standard deduction) by raising
the threshold at which progressive tax rates kick in. The proposal
would shift the trigger for the 28 percent tax bracket to $57,500
from the current $43,050. But in the attempt to eliminate the
potential loss of the marriage benefit for some couples, the change
would provide a tax bonus to all couples, regardless of income
levels. Such benefits are more urgently needed at the lower end of
the income scale.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, the House did raise the limit on qualification
for the earned income tax credit for the poorest taxpayers by
$2,000, to $14,460 _ a measure that should be retained.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate will do well by reducing the jump in the threshold
figure if not restoring it to its current level. The inequalities
in treatment of married and single taxpayers are the priority. They
should be fixed, not used to disguise a costly tax break.

PROTECTIONISM TAKES WING

<TEXT>
<P>
   A growing controversy between the European Union and the United
States over rules governing aircraft noise cloaks a deeper rift in
which trade protectionism has shown itself to be far from dead. US
negotiators are right to press vigorously for fair treatment of US
aircraft not only because the European rules penalize Americans
economically but because they penalize Europeans environmentally.
</P>
<P>
   Older, noisier American commercial aircraft like the Boeing 727
and the McDonnell Douglas DC9 have been modified to meet more
stringent rules by installing new engines and hush kits. But the EU
last year issued regulations that barred additional retro-fitted
aircraft from operating in Europe, starting in May of this year.
</P>
<P>
   American negotiators argue that the rule is an arbitrary one
having nothing to do with actual reduction of noise. In proposing
to ban new hush kits simply on design rather than performance
grounds, the Europeans have ignored other aircraft, including those
made in Europe that have no hush kits but are as noisy or noisier
than the aircraft equipped with the kits.
</P>
<P>
   The rule makes no sense in terms of making airports quieter _
but it makes a lot of sense in terms of aiding the competitiveness
of new European aircraft versus older American aircraft, many of
which operate in Europe. Americans estimate that operators of these
aircraft may lose value and that American manufacturers of hush
kits may lose as much as $1.6 billion in potential business.
</P>
<P>
   Quieter airplanes are desirable, of course, and Europeans and
Americans have cooperated in setting even more stringent standards,
dubbed Stage 4, for the newest aircraft. These planes will
gradually displace older planes affected by the EU rule, to the
benefit of all concerned _ without the economic dislocation being
launched by the EU.
</P>
<P>
   Bilateral agreement between the United States and EU would be
the easiest solution of the problem, but American negotiators
should, if required, turn to the dispute resolution mechanism in
the International Civil Aviation Organization. It is fully
justified in terms of trade fairness _ and quieter skies.

<TEXT>
<P>
   A team of physicists based at the University of Rome has
generated both intense excitement and profound skepticism among
scientists around the world by presenting evidence that they may
have detected a heavy particle that could solve a 70-year-old
mystery in astronomy and lead to a conceptual breakthrough in
physics.
</P>
<P>
   The presumed particles would weigh at least 50 times as much as
a proton and would almost always pass through other matter without
a trace because of an extremely weak ability to interact with it.
The new evidence, which so far has not been confirmed by other
scientists, would suggest that space is swarming with enough of the
particles to account for the long-sought ``dark matter'' that
astronomers believe makes up some 80 percent of all the mass in the
universe.
</P>
<P>
   Though astronomers have been measuring the gravitational pull of
the dark matter since the 1930s, they have never succeeded in
detecting it directly.
</P>
<P>
   A particle like the one that may have been found could also be
part of an entire family of still-undiscovered particles predicted
by an advanced theory of physics called supersymmetry. Many
physicists regard supersymmetry as a possible first step toward an
ultimate theory that would account for all the known forces and
particle behaviors in nature _ marrying quantum theory and gravity,
for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is right, this is clearly one of the great discoveries
of the last hundred years,'' said Dr. Michael Turner, a cosmologist
at the University of Chicago. ``To discover that most of the matter
in the universe is not what we're made of _ that's pretty
spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   But a number of scientists, including Turner, said it was still
unclear whether the finding was correct.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the team, Dr. Pierluigi Belli, is scheduled to
present the results next Friday in Marina del Rey, Calif., at the
Fourth International Symposium on Sources and Detection of Dark
Matter in the Universe. But this week, the team made a paper
describing the possible detection of the particle, variously called
a neutralino and a weakly interacting, massive particle, or WIMP,
available on its public Web site (http://www.lngs.infn.it/).
</P>
<P>
   According to the paper, whose lead author is Dr. Rita Bernabei,
a ``cumulative analysis'' of data collected over three years in an
underground experiment at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory east
of Rome ``favors the possible presence of a WIMP.'' The group came
to its conclusion by noting seasonal variations in the counts
registered on their detector, as expected if Earth is passing
through a cloud of the particles in its orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have, clearly, a seasonal variation,'' said Dr. Bernard
Sadoulet, an astrophysicist at the University of California at
Berkeley, who has read the team's paper.
</P>
<P>
   Sadoulet, with Dr. Blas Cabrera of Stanford University and Dr.
David O. Caldwell of the University of California at Santa Barbara,
leads another group that will make the first public presentation of
the results of its own search for dark matter at the same
conference.
</P>
<P>
   But Sadoulet added that ``there is a lot of skepticism in the
community'' as to whether the Rome group has really detected the
elusive WIMP. He said that unrelated seasonal effects, such as
temperature variations around the sensitive detectors or changes in
levels of natural radioactivity, could still be mimicking the
expected signal.
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions by e-mail, Bernabei wrote that ``all
known sources'' of such effects had been thoroughly analyzed in the
paper. She also pointed out that the new results showed ``full
compatibility'' with the team's earlier, published results, based
on less data, which suggested a WIMP of about the same size.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frank Avignone, a physicist at the University of South
Carolina who has visited the Gran Sasso laboratory, said that ``the
experiment, the apparatus, has been constructed very carefully.''
Avignone added, ``I'm not willing to say, `No, I don't believe
it,''' although he also expressed doubt that the measurement could
be considered definitive.
</P>
<P>
   Avignone said that if correct, the finding ``would definitely be
at the level of a Nobel Prize.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the scientists listed as authors on the team's new
paper, including Bernabei and Belli, are affiliated with both the
University of Rome and the National Institute of Nuclear Physics in
Italy. In addition, four authors are identified as members of the
Institute of High Energy Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Based on decades of indirect evidence, astronomers are all but
certain that dark matter makes up the vast majority of all matter
in the universe. Without the gravitational pull of the dark matter,
clusters of galaxies would fly apart, since the galaxies are
generally orbiting around each other too quickly to be held by the
gravity of observable matter.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The gravity of the dark matter is also thought to prevent
individual galaxies from breaking to pieces. Moreover, astronomers
have noted the presence of the dark matter's powerful gravity by
observing the way that it bends light rays, as it should according
to Einstein's theory of relativity.
</P>
<P>
   But because the matter seems utterly invisible, astronomers
believe that the dark matter is very different from the ordinary
stuff of which stars, planets and people are made. Cosmologists
studying how all matter was presumably created in the Big Bang, the
explosion in which the universe is thought to have been born, have
come to similar conclusions about the dark matter.
</P>
<P>
   Interacting only weakly among each other and with ordinary
matter, dark matter WIMPs are thought to clump like an immense
cloud or gas around the visible, starry parts of galaxies. Called a
halo, this structure may extend for hundreds of thousands of light
years into space beyond the visible disk of a galaxy like the Milky
Way.
</P>
<P>
   About one WIMP of the kind possibly found by the Rome group
would exist in a volume of space the size of a coffee cup. But
because the sun is orbiting around the center of the Milky Way at a
speed of about 140 miles per second, through the clouds of WIMPs,
``a billion of them would be passing through your body every
second,'' said Dr. Leszek Roszkowski, a particle physicist at
Lancaster University in England. ``And yet you would not be able to
detect them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rarely, however, a WIMP should interact with ordinary matter in
a collision. The Rome group set about trying to detect the WIMPs
with a material called sodium iodide, which scintillates, or emits
tiny flashes of light, when particles collide with it. The detector
is underground in order to shield it from showers ordinary
particles from space called cosmic rays.
</P>
<P>
   And to be sure that they were seeing the WIMPs, the group looked
for a rise and fall of the rate of detections over the course of
the seasons. Because of the way in which Earth is orbiting the sun,
which is itself in orbit around the galactic center, the detectors
should sense a ``wind'' of WIMPs that is slightly stronger in the
summer than the winter.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if a child on a merry-go-round were whirling a ball on
a string. The wind resistance on the ball would be greatest when it
was moving in the same direction as the merry-go-round, and the
least when moving in the opposite direction. In the WIMP
experiments, the expected difference over a year would amount to
``roughly 5 percent in the detection rate,'' Dr. Roszkowski said.
</P>
<P>
   It is an observation of this seasonal variation, or modulation,
that the Rome group is reporting in its paper, he said. The most
likely WIMP mass indicated by the results is about equal to that of
60 protons, or an entire atom of nickel.
</P>
<P>
   But Roszkowski added that because many processes vary with the
seasons on Earth, and because the expected modulation is so slight,
minor errors in the analysis could produce a false signal. ``They
are probing uncharted waters,'' he said. ``Skepticism is the most
healthy attitude in this respect.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other scientists pointed out that several other dark
matter experiments, including those of the Berkeley group, have
begun collecting data and the correctness of the result could be
tested quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no questioning the impact of the discovery if it
holds water, said Dr. David B. Cline, the physicist at the
University of California at Los Angeles who is organizing the
conference in Marina del Rey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Copernican revolution told us we're not the center of the
universe,'' Cline said. ``This tells us we're not the matter of the
universe.'' Intellectually, he said, the development ``is just the
tip of an incredible iceberg, if this is right.''

   Congo is the crippled giant of Africa, whose weakness has
encouraged other nations to intervene in its affairs. The United
States needs to support a UN initiative to end the war there before
the nation is torn apart.
</P>
<P>
   The outline of a peace settlement is provided in a cease-fire
agreement signed in Lusaka, Zambia, last August. It calls for
withdrawal of foreign troops and the dispatch of a 5,000-man UN
force to protect civilian peace monitors. If the foreigners
withdraw, this will send a signal to their Congolese allies that it
is time to stop fighting as well.
</P>
<P>
   The key nations are Zimbabwe, Uganda, and Rwanda. Zimbabwe
President Robert Mugabe has continental ambitions, hence his
involvement in a nation far from his borders. Yoweri Museveni of
Uganda intervened to end Congolese support for a domestic
insurgency and help his neighbor Rwanda. Zimbabwe is too poor to
sustain the war; Uganda has second thoughts. Both seem ready to
withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda's prime aim has been to eliminate Hutu insurgents,
remnants of death squads that killed several hundred thousand
Tutsis in Rwanda before a Tutsi army took over. The agreement is
weakest in its handling of these killers, but the UN force would
provide a check on their reemergence.
</P>
<P>
   In Congo, President Laurent Kabila owes his power to the
Rwandans, who later turned against him. The Congolese people ought
to choose their own leader, free from outside coercion. They will
not get this chance if the war continues.
</P>
<P>
   African diplomats persuaded the warring parties to sign the
Lusaka agreement, but their nations are too weak to enforce it
alone. The United States should provide a substantial subsidy as
well as logistical support, but no ground troops. The Clinton
administration does not want to get involved until all fighting
ends, but violence will continue without a UN presence. The
administration needs to back the insertion of the force and lobby
Congress to provide money to get it going.
</P>
<P>
   The Congolese face enormous difficulties in reconstructing their
nation. They cannot begin until the UN makes sure the outsiders
have left.

U.S. IS SAID TO SEE LINKS BETWEEN TERRORISM AND ISLAMIC CHARITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Ill., Texas)   (bl)  
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   U.S. officials investigating a decade of international terrorist
attacks say they have found a common thread _ Islamic charities and
relief organizations that they suspect are being used to move men,
money and weapons across borders.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile charged
with masterminding the 1998 bombings of U.S. Embassies in East
Africa, relied on at least nine of the groups in his recent
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Other charities and relief groups, the officials said, have been
linked to a recent plot to bomb historic and tourist sites in
Jordan, the 1993 bombing of New York City's World Trade Center and
terrorist attacks in Egypt against tourists and government
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``These charities and relief groups are a crucial part of
terrorism's infrastructure,'' said one official who monitors
terrorism closely. ``Money people give for worthy causes should not
wind up buying explosives or phony passports. But we still know too
little about how Islamic fundamentalists use and abuse these
groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 6,000 Islamic groups operating worldwide are
considered legitimate and provide emergency relief in dangerous and
desperate places with the support of friendly states. In addition,
the officials said, the charities are often unaware that terrorists
have used them as cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these groups do some good works in some places,'' one
official said. ``And often, only a few officials or a single
chapter involving a small part of the charity's leadership or
resources is being used.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Clinton administration has previously investigated
alleged links between individual Islamic charities and specific
terrorist groups, this is the first time that it is scrutinizing a
block of such groups to determine whether they are being used,
wittingly or not, by Islamic terrorist networks. As such, officials
said, the inquiry is a major expansion of the government's
counterterrorism efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has been pressing the United States for years to
spearhead an international crackdown on Islamic charities and
private relief groups. But officials said Washington had been
reluctant to interfere in a domain safeguarded by constitutional
guarantees of free association and separation of church and state.
In addition, officials said, they lacked evidence that could be
used in public court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, U.S. officials have circulated within the
government a list of more than 30 groups that they are examining
for links to terrorism, at least two of which are based in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In January, a team of officials led by the Treasury Department
visited Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and other Arab states to
discuss specific charities with their Middle Eastern counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, officials said they planned to seek new legal
authority to confiscate the assets of charities that acted as
fronts for terrorism. This measure, the officials said, is part of
a broad anti-terrorism package that the government will soon
propose to Parliament. Canada cut off government financing in 1997
to Human Concern International, a Canadian-based group, for what
official documents call the group's ``terrorist connections.''
</P>
<P>
   That group is also being investigated by the United States, said
U.S. and Canadian officials. The director of the charity, Kaleem
Akhtar, denied that his group had terrorist links and said it was
``totally wrong'' to defame groups that did such good work.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said their investigations into the role of such
Islamic charities and relief groups had been prompted by recent
terrorist attacks and plots. The officials acknowledged that the
scrutiny was politically and diplomatically sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said charities could provide excellent cover for
terrorist groups, because relief workers are welcomed almost
everywhere and their shipments of supplies are rarely checked by
border guards or the police.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Discovering the origins and supporters of such charities may be
difficult, investigators said. While the United States, Canada and
several European states require tax-exempt charities to file at
least annual reports listing their assets, expenditures and
officers, many states, including several in the Middle East, do
not.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One instance in which investigators said they believed that the
role of charities was crucial was the bombings of the embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, crimes that killed more than 200 people
and wounded thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said material seized from the Nairobi office of the
Mercy International Relief Agency includes records of calls to the
cellular telephone of bin Laden. Another document found at the
office, dated two weeks before the bombings, refers to ``getting
the weapons from Somalia.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercy, based in Ireland, was one of five private associations
that Kenya closed weeks after the bombing. The government said
those groups had ``deviated from development objectives'' and
``posed a serious threat'' to Kenya's security.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, officials disclosed that a roommate of one the
men charged with plotting to bomb targets in the United States had
worked for Mercy in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The State Department stepped up its efforts to investigate the
charities late last year, after officials involved in
counterterrorism work found that the United States government had
inadvertently helped support questionable charities. The State
Department had included a charity that counterterrorism officials
say has ties to Sudan's governing Islamic party on a list of 50
groups through which Americans could aid refugees in Kosovo. The
State Department has identified Sudan as a sponsor of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The charity, the Islamic African Relief Agency, also received
two grants in 1998 worth $4.2 million for work in Mali from the
State Department's Agency for International Development. The grants
to the charity, which is one of the 30 being scrutinized, were cut
off in December at the State Department's request on grounds that
they were not in America's ``national security interests,'' an AID
official said. The organization's president said he was appealing
the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from Columbia, Mo., where the charity has been
registered since 1984, its director, Ahmed Mubarak, said his group
had ``nothing to do with Sudan'' and that Washington had never
accused it of any terrorist-related activity. ``We are simply
trying to help people wherever they need help, Mubarak said.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of more than 30 groups with suspected ties to
terrorists includes two based in the United States, the Global
Relief Foundation Inc. and the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and
Development, based in Richardson, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have been looking into Holy Land since the
mid-1990s. Some government officials recommended that the group be
prosecuted in 1997 for supporting Hamas, the militant Islamic
group. But others opposed the effort, fearing that it would expose
intelligence sources and spur public criticism of the
administration as anti-Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry appears to have been revived. Responding recently to
a lawsuit by Steven Emerson, a journalist who follows militant
Islamic groups, the State Department said it could not make
documents about Holy Land public because the group was the subject
of ``an ongoing law-enforcement proceeding.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the group, Donya C. Witherspoon, said Holy Land had
no involvement with terrorism and had been very careful that its
donations cannot be used by terrorist groups. ``Their whole purpose
and emphasis is anti-terrorist,'' Witherspoon said.
</P>
<P>
   Contending that it was a front for Hamas, Israel closed the
charity and four others in May 1997. An Israeli official said the
government had provided ``thousands of pages of information'' about
the group to American officials, urging them and other Western
governments to close it.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Global Relief, Stanley Cohen, called the
investigation of that foundation a ``scurrilous attack'' and
``another of the government's pathetic attempts to sully committed
Islamic organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports filed for 1998, the most recent available, said Global
Relief, of Bridgeview, Ill., had an income of $1.7 million and
distributed ``food, clothing, relief supplies'' to refugees, flood
victims and orphans.

BALANCED REFORM OF BANKRUPTCY

<P>
   Congress has struggled to tighten bankruptcy laws to prevent
escape from indebtedness by those who exploit weaknesses in the
rules. But current bills in both the House and Senate fail to
address some of the worst abuses, while being too harsh on debtors
who have fallen into legitimate difficulties from illness, job
loss, or similar problems.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month the Senate voted overwhelmingly for a bill
that purports to make it more difficult for wealthier debtors to
conceal assets through their homes, but the bill allows states to
opt out of the provision. This move reinforces debt sanctuaries in
states like Florida and Texas, notorious for protecting clever
users of bankruptcy loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   The bill offers little hope for the majority of those seeking
protection of bankruptcy law, by raising the standards under which
they might escape obligations they could never meet _ obligations
undertaken before illness, loss of employment, or divorce radically
changed their financial situation.
</P>
<P>
   In setting arbitrary standards for basic cost-of-living
exemptions from debt recovery, for example, the Senate bill robs
bankruptcy courts of practical judgment about local costs and
varying family circumstances that deserve consideration in
appraising the ability to repay debts. These standards are
important in determining which debtors qualify for Chapter 7
protection _ which offers broader escape from indebtedness _ or
Chapter 13, which is more stringent in requiring repayment.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Bankruptcy Reform Act is hailed by the nation's
banks and credit card companies but opposed by consumer groups. No
one denies the importance of debtors accepting responsibility for
their obligations, and abuse of the system has cast a shadow over
those with legitimate needs. But families in genuine crisis should
not be further hounded or denied a fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   Congress will have to find an acceptable middle ground between
these two issues, by tightening further limits on protected assets
while preserving the bankruptcy courts' leeway in judging
individual cases. Otherwise the system will creak on in a form that
continues to allow significant abuses.

NET'S RISE KEEPS A LID ON PRICES, FOR NOW  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By TOM REDBURN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, I went shopping for a 32-inch television set. I
visited a couple of local electronics superstores, read Consumer
Reports, talked to friends. And I searched the Internet, where I
found just the highly rated, feature-laden model I wanted, for
$750, shipping included. No tax.
</P>
<P>
   The salesman at Circuit City was willing to match the price, but
with the sales tax it would still cost me more. So I bought the TV
set from an e-commerce site called 800.com. It arrived recently and
works perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   This was a great deal for me. And by making it, I participated
in a grand experiment that is helping to hold down inflation while
sustaining the booming economy. Too bad it can't last.
</P>
<P>
   Let me explain. There are several big reasons why the American
economy has managed in recent years to defy the rule of thumb that
strong growth and low unemployment inevitably lead the general
level of prices up an accelerating escalator. Perhaps the most
crucial factor lately has been fierce competition from Internet
shopping sites willing to sell goods at a loss in order to lure
customers from traditional retailers.
</P>
<P>
   While comparatively few people actually buy much yet online, the
cut-rate prices widely available in the virtual economy have forced
many companies operating in the bricks-and-mortar world to respond
by keeping their prices low, too.
</P>
<P>
   As Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo Bank in
Minneapolis, recently noted in just one example among many: ``Many
people check toy prices on the Internet and ask toy stores to match
them. Or they see the merchandise at a store and go home and buy it
for less on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   This is heaven for consumers. While the general price level for
all goods and services has been rising for the last few years at
what is still a very modest 2 percent or so, prices in many of the
most competitive arenas are actually down.
</P>
<P>
   The price index for toys, as calculated by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, has been falling since 1995. Books, on average, cost
less today than in 1997. Prices for audio and video equipment,
which just joined the e-commerce rush, dipped last year by 0.38
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But it is hell for retailers. Despite the benefit of a sales tax
exemption, e-commerce companies selling everything from Harry
Potter and Pokemon to DVD players and the ``Saving Private Ryan''
disks to watch on them _ all at big discounts _ are losing tons of
money.
</P>
<P>
   Some say they are inherently more efficient, and it is just a
matter of time before they turn a profit. Others, like Buy.com,
argue that they don't need to make money on products they sell to
consumers, because they expect to make plenty selling ad space on
their sites.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, merchants on the Web don't really care, as long as
investors remain willing to bid up their stock, making it easy to
raise even more cash to cover their losses.
</P>
<P>
   This situation is bound to come to an end. It won't happen
immediately, but even Internet companies cannot continue to lose
money indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a shakeout,'' said Jose A. Rasco, an
economist at Hoenig &AMP; Co. in Rye Brook, N.Y., who wrote a short
report last week on what he calls ``digital deflation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a big believer in the model that says you can sell at
a loss but make it up on volume,'' Rasco added. ``And ad spending
won't hold up in a downturn. So when the consolidation takes place
_ and it will _ suppliers will regain some pricing leverage over
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this diminishes the extraordinary economic benefits to
be derived from the commercialization of the Internet. Even after
many of the Web sites that cannot generate a profit disappear, the
Internet will remain a powerful tool for bringing together
potential buyers and sellers from anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Web will continue to empower consumers by giving them a lot
more information to use in bargaining for the best price.
</P>
<P>
   Cars, for example, are not sold online, but sites like Autobytel
(www.autobytel.com) and CarPoint (www.carpoint.com) allow buyers to
solicit bids from a number of dealers from the haven of their own
desks. And there is now a wealth of once-secret wholesale price
information available online.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when the Edmunds Blue Book was practically the holy
grail,'' Rasco said. ``Now you can get it everywhere online for
free.''
</P>
<P>
   This free-for-all has forced every supplier that wants to
survive to become more efficient, enhancing economic growth in
myriad ways. And consumers, taking advantage of their savings, have
more money left to spend freely on all kinds of things.
</P>
<P>
   But the current arrangement, in which many Web shopping sites
are practically giving away their products, is too good to last.
Enjoy it while you can.

THE PRESIDENCEY IN 2000 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, February 21, 2000)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   It is Presidents Day, a time when, in centennial years, the
nation was embroiled in campaigns that produced epochal changes.
Yet in neither 1800 nor 1900 did the voters rise up with one voice
to demand the change they soon got.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jefferson took office in 1801 and Theodore Roosevelt in
1901 _ two of history's greatest reform presidents. But Jefferson
barely squeaked in _ the House elevated him after he and Aaron Burr
had split the electoral vote. And voters in 1900 reelected William
McKinley, a slow-moving conciliator; it was an assassin's bullet
that put Vice President Roosevelt in the White House the following
September.
</P>
<P>
   Now the calendar has turned again, and the current campaign
offers voters in both parties choices of how much change they want
and what kind.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore and George Bush are descendants of the last two
presidents (the former politically, the latter biologically) and
thereby offer some level of continuity. Bill Bradley and John
McCain claim to be insurgents of one sort or another.
</P>
<P>
   This year's backdrop is unique. Bill Clinton was only the second
president to be impeached, and all the candidates have sought to
distance themselves from his misbehavior. Yet voters in some recent
elections have tried too hard to right past wrongs: Jimmy Carter
won the first post-Watergate election in 1976 largely by promising
never to tell a lie. The other side of the Clinton factor is that
the economy is strong, his job approval rating is exceptionally
high, and he is talking about the future more convincingly than any
of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson's ``personal contribution to American political
institutions,'' according to historian Daniel J. Boorstin, ``was
his model of a strong presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt boldly claimed that the president should exercise all
power not specifically prohibited by the Constitution or Congress,
``and not to content himself with the negative merits of keeping
his talents undamaged in a napkin.''
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time to demand the deeper presidential philosophies
of this year's candidates. With them, voters might get a strong
leader not by luck, but by design.

IN BRAZIL, INVESTING FOR THE GOOD OF NATURE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Va.)   (af)  
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Seated in his office in a gaudy new
skyscraper here, wearing a tailored suit and cuff links, John
Michael Forgach seems every bit the conventional investment banker.
Then he starts talking about babassu coconuts.
</P>
<P>
   Forgach beams as he describes the exotic projects in which he
invests: a sustainable timber operation in the rain forest, a
plantation producing carbon filters from coconut husks, a company
with a plan to export acai, the protein-rich purple Amazonian
fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not really into stocks and bonds here,'' said Forgach,
the managing partner of Banco Axial, a three-year-old investment
bank. ``We're into profiting from the idea that the world would
like to consume the 59 other types of potato that are not on the
McDonald's menu.''
</P>
<P>
   With Forgach, 51, at its helm, Axial is at the forefront of
biodiversity investing, a trend that began with ``socially
conscious'' investors in the United States and Europe over the last
20 years. Unlike most of the field, though, Banco Axial fits the
same description as its investments: it is a home-grown product of
a developing country.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Axial is probably the leading example of how some
Brazilians are harnessing market forces to help protect the
country's environmental assets, especially its rain forests, from
depredation. In short, these investors are backing projects that
profit from preserving those assets.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to an adventurous culture inspired by Forgach at the
bank, Axial's forays into far-flung parts of Latin America to seek
out viable projects are gaining considerable attention. ``There is
really nothing like Axial around anywhere,'' said Bryan Husted, a
professor of management at the Technological Institute of Advanced
Studies in Monterrey, Mexico. ``It's like they're putting the
Indiana Jones into investing.''
</P>
<P>
   The analogy of the intrepid explorer is not all that
far-fetched. Forgach hires young people fresh out of college or
graduate school to scout projects, dispatching them on expeditions
deep into rough terrain to study possible investments, like an
organic soybean operation in eastern Bolivia. Sometimes he goes
along on the trips, to size up a project's viability firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   When the scouts, few of whom have banking or finance
backgrounds, find something promising, Axial makes an equity
investment. Typically, it risks around $1 million on behalf of the
investors in its $15 million Terra Capital fund, including the
Swiss government, the World Bank and other institutions and private
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough to just like environmental issues,'' said
Patricia Moles, 32, a Mexican who came to Axial as a fund manager
after working as a consultant for environmental groups. ``It's
about balance sheets and taxes and educating people about equity.''
</P>
<P>
   Axial came to biodiversity investing by trial and error. The
bank was the brainchild of Pierre Landolt, a Swiss billionaire who
lives in Brazil. It was originally intended to focus on
privatizations and mergers and acquisitions in Brazilian regions
ignored by large investment banks, like Paraiba in the
drought-prone northeast, where Landolt produces cheese in a
demonstration project on his estate.
</P>
<P>
   But many of its early deals proved unprofitable, and Axial lost
money each year. So Forgach, who had previously worked for Chase
Manhattan, sought to reposition Axial as a specialized money
manager, investing its own capital and that of clients in what he
calls ``green things.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, most of Forgach's green things have been organic foods
for export, a market with booming demand. In the United States,
consumers bought $4.7 billion of organic food last year and sales
are growing at 24 percent a year, compared with about 1 percent
growth in conventional foods, according to the Organic Trade
Association in Greenfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of Axial's investments have been in organic food
companies, including a cranberry farm in Chile and a plantation in
the Amazon producing hearts of palm.
</P>
<P>
   But Axial has also found other kinds of environmentally benign
enterprises in which to invest, like the timber and coconut-fiber
projects and eco-tourism businesses in Ecuador and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The company's agility has a lot to do with Forgach's peripatetic
history. Born to Hungarian parents in southern Brazil, he earned an
undergraduate degree at Harvard before going into banking and,
later, the oil business, working for the reclusive commodity trader
Marc Rich in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   After forming his own Geneva-based oil-trading outfit, a
business that required him to travel extensively in Africa and
Latin America, Forgach developed a passion for rare birds, amassing
a personal collection of more than 200. He created an organization,
the Hyazinthinus Foundation, to contribute to the protection of
endangered tropical birds.
</P>
<P>
   When the growing use of futures contracts began to squeeze
margins in 1985, Forgach left the oil business and moved into money
management. He returned to Brazil in 1995, initially intending to
create a nonprofit organization to combat illegal trade in rare
animals.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, though, he was approached by Landolt to run Axial. ``I got
to combine my banker and romantic ecology hats,'' Forgach said in
English so faintly accented that its influences are hard to pin
down.
</P>
<P>
   His current challenge is to make Axial not just green but also
profitable. He expects Terra Capital to show a small loss in its
first full year _ figures are not available yet _ but annual
returns of 20 percent to 30 percent in the next few years as
investments start paying off. If successful, Axial plans to raise
$300 million more to create similar funds specializing in sectors
like food and timber.
</P>
<P>
   But fresh investment opportunities may prove harder for
Forgach's young scouts to find, since Axial's success in attracting
capital has lured other entrants to biodiversity investing in Latin
America. The playing field was virtually empty a couple of years
ago, but there are now about eight funds seeking viable investments
in environmentally benign enterprises in emerging markets, and more
may be on the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of venture capital to support ecologically sound
businesses is growing fast,'' said Tammy Newmark, manager of the
EcoEnterprises fund in Arlington, Va., which invests in eco-tourism
and ``alternative'' agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Newmark's fund, created at the beginning of this year with $10
million in capital, much of it from the Nature Conservancy, focuses
on projects undertaken by local environmental organizations in
collaboration with the private sector, an area she says Axial
neglects. ``Axial is the big kid on the block compared to us,''
Newmark said.

ACCOUNTING FOR WASTE

<TEXT>
<P>
   As visions of how to spend federal budget surpluses dance
through politician's heads, the General Accounting Office has some
sober advice. The government should not neglect the billions of
dollars it could save by cleaning up its financial systems.
</P>
<P>
   The gloomy mantra of fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement ran
through a GAO report released last week. The good news is in the
improvements. Between fiscal years 1996 and 1998, for example, the
estimated total of overpayments in Medicare's fee-for-service
program dropped from $23.2 billion to $12.6 billion. The bad news
is that government agencies still have an overwhelming number of
problem areas.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare has been bilked by both career criminals and legitimate
service providers. In 1998 there were $1.6 billion in Supplemental
Security Income overpayments. The program also suffers from what
the report describes as ``20 years of inattention to payment
controls.''
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Defense ``cannot properly account for billions
of dollars of basic transactions.'' An exact overpayment figure is
unknown. But between 1994 and 1998, defense contractors returned
$4.6 billion in overpayments.
</P>
<P>
   The report also points to weaknesses in the Department of
Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Education's
student loan program and inequities in federal grant formulas.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a case of crafty computer hackers or sophisticated
saboteurs, just an embarrassing epidemic of poor management. Like a
doctor suggesting aspirin for a headache, the report patiently
points out known solutions. Legislation passed in 1996 gave the
Health Care Financing Administration increased funding for obvious
safeguards such as setting up investigative units and reviewing
medical claims. Such precautions, the report notes, ``historically
return more than $10 in savings for each dollar spent.''
</P>
<P>
   So when politicians or candidates talk about the budget surplus,
they should also be encouraged to address the administrative abyss
that's draining away billions of hard-earned tax dollars.

EAST TIMOR'S PLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, February 21, 2000)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kofi Annan's brief, emotional visit Thursday to East Timor drew
international attention to the devastation visited upon that newly
liberated territory by vengeful Indonesian officers and their
militia proxies. Commendably, the United Nations secretary general
seized the occasion to invoke a need for justice as well as the
international community's commitment to help rebuild what
Indonesia's occupation forces had razed to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Annan told the Timorese that if the government in Jakarta
reneges on its promises to punish the Indonesian military and
police officials behind the deliberate campaign of killing, raping,
and destruction last autumn, then members of the Security Council
``may revert to the international tribunal.'' In reality, it is
highly unlikely that Russia and China would accede to such a
proposal, since both wish to avoid any precedent that might appear
to be interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Annan was properly expressing the moral revulsion
that the outside world has felt at the blind, destructive fury
unleashed upon the Timorese _ and a concomitant wish to bring the
criminals to justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devastation I have been able to see so far is far worse
than what I had imagined from the reports and what I saw on
television,'' Annan told a crowd of 5,000 Timorese in the capital,
Dili. Left unsaid was the enormous challenge of an invisible
devastation _ the nearly total absence of administrative structures
that are required for East Timor's revival.
</P>
<P>
   The UN peacekeeping force that takes control of the territory
Wednesday will have to install those structures while providing
electricity, clean water, health care, shelter, education, and a
modicum of economic activity leading to job creation. The funds
pledged for this work must be delivered swiftly, and the usual
bureaucratic languor of the UN and the World Bank must be overcome.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a crying need for the rule of law on the ground in
East Timor, so that refugees may return and justice not be
supplanted by vengeance. Annan's visit was a good symbolic start
along this hard road.

LIFE WITHOUT A LAUGH TRACK

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Hank McCune Show'' lasted three short months in late 1950
yet merits consideration a half-century later thanks to one dubious
factoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV
Shows'' notes that the show boasted ``an innovation in a soundtrack
that contains audience laughter ... the practice may have unlimited
possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlimited, indeed. Fake and ``sweetened'' laugh tracks, made
exponentially more raucous by turning up the volume knob on the
anemic titters of a studio audience, have been a staple of
television comedy ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Hank's contraption hasn't been bursting forth with its canned
peals of laughter much lately. Many hands have been wrung this
television season over the sorry plight of sitcoms. Here's a
question more vexing than any on ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'':
Are the days of the standard sitcom, shot in front of an audience
of dazed, dozing tourists bused in from Hollywood Boulevard, on the
wane?
</P>
<P>
   Sitcom woes began before the season got started. Folks handing
out Emmys decided that there were no sitcoms worthy of a trophy and
gave the Outstanding Comedy Series Emmy to a category interloper,
David E. Kelley's hourlong dramedy, ``Ally McBeal.'' Since then,
every sitcom introduced at the beginning of this season has been
canceled, or should be _ only ``Ladies Man'' on CBS and ``Stark
Raving Mad'' on NBC survive, thanks mainly to solid time slots, and
they both will soon make room for midseason replacements.
</P>
<P>
   The season's only new hit comedy is ``Malcolm in the Middle,'' a
family series that eschews laugh tracks and is shot with one
camera, like TV dramas. NBC's midseason-replacement comedies
likewise eschew the traditional: Two, ``God, the Devil and Bob''
and ``Sammy,'' are animated; one, ``M.Y.O.B,'' is a single-camera
show; one, ``Daddio,'' is a family series; and the last one,
``Battery Park,'' adds more cameras, including a Steadicam, and
many sequences not shot before its studio audience. CBS, too, is
reintroducing ``Grapevine,'' a single-camera show that was first
seen as a summer replacement sitcom in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling Stone TV writer David Wild, author of ``The
Showrunners,'' a portrait of the people who create television
series, says, ``The sitcom has virtually been killed from overuse.
In the past, people have seen just about every possible situation,
not only in prime time but also in syndication. There's nothing
more soul-killing than watching an unfunny sitcom. Someone has to
reinvent the form.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Herzog, president of Fox Entertainment, seems to agree.
``You talk to younger people in this country, and what you'll hear
them say about sitcoms is, `They're for my parents _ that's what my
parents watch,''' Herzog says. ``And there's something about the
traditional sitcom format, and there's something about that canned
laughter that I think is unnerving to younger audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Garth Ancier, president of NBC Entertainment, disagrees: ``I
don't think the four-camera, laugh-track thing is dead at all. I
completely disagree. When those shows are well-written around
people you care about, they work. No one seems to complain about
`Will &AMP; Grace' as a four-camera show, because it's funny, the idea
is good, and the cast is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, only one of NBC's five midseason comedies is a
traditional, four-camera/live audience sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   So should we box up the laugh-track machines and ship them off
to the Smithsonian, or at least the Museum of Television and Radio?
Wild says, ``Obviously, it's annoying; we've been laugh-tracked to
our elbows. But the important thing is, we're not laughing. We
wouldn't notice the laugh track if we were laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   Linwood Boomer, creator of ``Malcolm,'' admits, ``I think the
show would really fall dead in front of an audience, just in the
pile. I'm not sure if a studio audience would feel real comfortable
laughing when a wheelchair goes over. It is a sizable investment
for both the network and the studio to invest in a single-camera
show. It's a lot more expensive and a lot more time consuming.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Higgins, co-executive producer of ``Malcolm,'' adds, ``My
problem with the audience is that you need to force jokes in there,
usually three jokes a page, to keep them laughing. It's easier to
make people laugh with a setup-joke, setup-joke format. But that's
also how you make your story more false, when you feel you have to
get a laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, those who create sitcoms increasingly have little use
for these cues telling the poor schnooks when they should be
busting a gut. Don Roos, who created the upcoming NBC single-camera
sitcom ``M.Y.O.B.,'' flatly states, ``I don't like laugh tracks. So
when I wanted to do a show, I wanted to make sure that I could do
it like a small movie, where the characters say things for their
own reasons and logic and not just to get a laugh. This is a
response to sitcoms, in a way. They just don't appeal to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary David Goldberg enjoyed phenomenal success with ``Family
Ties,'' but his ``Brooklyn Bridge,'' produced without a laugh
track, struggled despite critical acclaim. Nonetheless, of his
upcoming NBC cop comedy ``Battery Park,'' he says, ``We would be
happy without a laugh track. We have an audience, but our show is
kind of a hybrid. We have six cameras, we have Steadicams, we shoot
outdoors, we shoot behind the sets, we have shorter scenes. It's
not as friendly to that (studio) audience, and we just keep pushing
the pace. We don't hold for those laughs quite the way we did on
`Family Ties.' But, yes, we'd like to do this without a laugh
track.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some highly successful showrunners swear by
the laugh track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laugh tracks aren't annoying when the show's funny,'' offers
Phil Rosenthal, executive producer of ``Everybody Loves Raymond,''
which in its fourth season is drawing its largest audiences to
date, routinely beating Emmy winner ``Ally McBeal.'' ``Seeing a
show with a live studio audience is like seeing a live theatrical
presentation. You feel part of a large audience; it's sort of
communal in that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, you're seeing actors react in subtle ways to that live
studio audience, and that enhances that live-performance feeling.
It gives the show that much more energy than a one-camera show with
no laugh track. It's almost not conscious _ they're creating that
enthusiasm on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Drew Carey Show'' co-creator Bruce Helford swears by his
studio audience. ``When a joke doesn't work, we rewrite it right
there on the spot _ we fix the show as we go. One-camera allows you
to get lazy; there's no testing ground. A writer can say, `Well,
that's kind of funny,' and there's no audience to call him on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Helford points out, audiences have come to expect
laughs from a sitcom soundtrack. He notes that the struggling
comedy ``Sports Night,'' which doesn't have a laugh track, follows
``Dharma &AMP; Greg,'' which is taped before an audience. ``People
watch that show and wonder, `Why isn't anybody laughing?' It can
hurt a show in terms of a mainstream audience. The show doesn't
seem funny. Not that it isn't, but you don't hear those knockdown
guffaws. `Malcolm' gets away with it because it follows `The
Simpsons,' which also has no laugh track.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, showrunners are divided on whether the cheaper method
of shooting a show in one night before four cameras will be
replaced by the far more polished single-camera style.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins says ``Malcolm'' ``couldn't be represented in
four-camera _ it wouldn't capture the nuances. You wouldn't be able
to see this messed-up family from the perspective of inside this
kid's head. This way, you have Malcolm telling the audience, `I'm
in this messed-up family, but I know it, and it's OK.' It wouldn't
be effective if you didn't know that Malcolm knew what was going
on. We're helping comment on the action with camera angles and
close-ups and how the frame is focused. We can do an extreme
close-up on Malcolm's eyes or props on the set and point out the
humor. The way the camera insinuates itself into the action _
that's our laugh track.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Raymond's'' Rosenthal, on the other hand, is happy with the
four-camera system. ``Even if we did one-camera filming, a lot of
the dialogue would be the same. You might see them walk through the
house more smoothly, or in a car or outside. But `Raymond' is
squarely in the tradition of sitcoms _ the audience understands
it's presentational, that there are the same four or five sets
every episode. Within those parameters, we're as realistic as
possible.'' &QL;

NASA EXTENDS MAPPING MISSION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once in danger of being curtailed by as much as a day, NASA's
Earth-mapping activities aboard the shuttle Endeavour received an
unexpected nine-hour extension, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The mapping will continue through early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the mission, the mapping was in jeopardy of being
curtailed because of a broken thruster on the 200-foot-long radar
antenna mast protruding from the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   With several days of intensive fuel conservation efforts earlier
this week, the space agency was able to restore the originally
planned Sunday night cutoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to rest on our laurels right now,'' NASA's Milt
Heflin, the mission operations director, said as he announced the
extension. ``We want to see what else that we can do to squeeze out
a little more time.''
</P>
<P>
   When informed of the extension, Endeavour commander Kevin Kregel
responded, ``That is super news.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration did not change
plans to end Endeavour's 11-day flight at 3:52 p.m. CST Tuesday
with a landing at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's decision means the shuttle crew will no longer have an
opportunity to retrieve the radar antenna mast with a spacewalk if
the device jams during the planned retraction early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   If an electric motor cannot retract the $35 million,
one-of-a-kind mast and fold it into a 9-foot-tall storage canister
in Endeavour's cargo bay, it must be jettisoned. The motor and a
backup are activated by the astronauts with a flip of a switch in
the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists said Friday they were willing to abandon the mast for
the opportunity to map the Earth's terrain for even a few extra
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to bring the mast home more than I do,'' said
NASA's Mike Kobrick, the mapping mission's chief scientist. ``On
the other hand, more data is better. No matter how much data they
give, I'll want just a little bit more.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's decision represented an about-face for NASA.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttle managers surprised scientists a few weeks before
Endeavour's Jan. 11 liftoff by lopping a day from the original
mapping plans so the mast could be preserved with a spacewalk, if
necessary. The mast could be reflown aboard the shuttle at a later
date, they reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   So as Endeavour lifted off, NASA's plan was to curtail the
mapping Sunday night rather than Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Heflin said NASA changed its mind because of the increased odds
the mast can be retracted without a spacewalk and the flawless
performance of the mapping apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   The mast extended flawlessly under the power of the electric
motors within hours of Endeavour's launching. Soon, though, Sunday
night began to fade as a reasonable mapping goal.
</P>
<P>
   A small nitrogen gas-fueled thruster used to aim the tip of the
antenna mast at the Earth's surface stopped working. The shuttle's
own propulsion system took over the aiming task.
</P>
<P>
   But as the shuttle fuel usage soared, NASA said it would have to
stop the mapping well before Sunday night if it could not develop
fuel conservation measures.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, NASA had found the fuel to make it to Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, Heflin said, there was enough fuel and electrical
power to map until early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The radar apparatus secured in Endeavour's cargo bay scans the
Earth's rippled terrain as the astronauts circle the planet.
Antennas in the shuttle's cargo bay and on the tip of the antenna
mast collect and record the signals as they bounce off the terrain
below.
</P>
<P>
   Later, scientists will convert the recordings into a
three-dimensional map of the major land masses south of Hudson Bay
in Canada and north of Cape Hope in South America.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, the astronauts had mapped 42 million square miles
or 88 percent of their target area at least once. Scientists,
however, want all of the territory mapped at least twice to improve
the accuracy. NASA said 27 million square miles, or 57 percent, had
been mapped two times.

<P>
   PRICELESS COMMODITIES
</P>
<P>
   When George W. Bush was delayed in getting to a rally in
Clinton, S.C., Friday, Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma picked up the
slack, making a curious pitch that acknowledged questions about the
Texas governor's policy expertise. ``In order to be a good
president, you don't have to be a foreign or domestic policy
wonk,'' Watts told the audience. ``You can buy dozens of policy
wonks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be clever,'' Watts added. ``You can buy
clever.'' What, then, could Bush offer without the assistance of
the federal wallet? ``Decency,'' Watts said. ``You can't buy
decency and you can't buy good.''
</P>
<P>
   THE DEMOCRATS
</P>
<P>
   A STOP IN HARLEM
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley returned Friday to a part of Harlem
where he tutored children 30 years ago as a New York Knick. He was
there to promote his education proposals and to build interest in
his debate with Vice President Al Gore at the Apollo Theater in New
York on Monday. At the Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Middle School
Academy in Harlem, Bradley, who used the event to try to show his
longstanding ties to the black community, was introduced by
Clifford Alexander, a former secretary for the Army under President
Carter. ``This is not a drive-by-the-black-community candidate,''
Alexander, who grew up in Harlem, said of Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   TAILORING ADS
</P>
<P>
   With an eye on voters in the March 7 primaries in New York and
California, Vice President Al Gore released two new television
commercials Friday. One features the candidate speaking entirely in
Spanish, saying he will work to improve schools and fight crime.
The other is a slightly edited version of a commercial he released
two days ago. The updated version includes his endorsement by an
abortion-rights group.
</P>
<P>
   THE POLLS
</P>
<P>
   HOME STATE ADVANTAGE
</P>
<P>
   The latest poll by the Arizona Republic shows Sen. John McCain
has opened a commanding lead over George W. Bush in his home state
with a primary there next Tuesday.He outpaces the Texas governor 52
percent to 29 percent among likely Republican voters. Native sons
almost always win big in their states, but some prominent Arizona
Republicans, chiefly Gov. Jane Dee Hull, have endorsed Bush, who
led in some polls there last fall. So for months the question has
been whether McCain would win by a margin that seemed decisive,
with Bush supporters claiming anything less than a 2-1 finish
should count as a defeat. The Republic poll, which was conducted
over the five days ending Wednesday, and has a margin of sampling
error of five percentage points, found Bush could win only if
virtually all the undecided Republicans tilted to his side.
</P>
<P>
   LATINO VOTERS
</P>
<P>
   Almost half of California's Latino voters have registered to
vote in the last six years, motivated by Proposition 187, which
sought to ban education and public services to illegal immigrants,
according to a Field Institute poll. The registration has given
Latinos a much more powerful voice that could have huge
implications for California politics and the March 7 presidential
primary, according to the institute. The poll, of 459 registered
Latino voters statewide, found that the new voters were younger and
had less income and education than established Latino voters.
Almost half were born outside the United States.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Half a century ago, when postwar youths sought a
means of expressing their rebelliousness, automobiles provided a
distinctly American medium. Rear ends were jacked up, muscle was
added and hot rods, their radios blaring rock 'n' roll, were
created to fly past the dreary old symbols of their elders.
</P>
<P>
   But Chicanos _ for the most part immigrants struggling with
poverty and discrimination in the barrios _ took a look at these
middle-class American icons and conceived them in a very different
light.
</P>
<P>
   In the capable hands of these young Mexican-Americans, cast-off
older cars _ the only ones they could usually afford _ were
lovingly transformed into potent statements. Moving in the opposite
direction from their white counterparts, they created lowriders _
customized cars that, by crafty design, rode low and slow, cruising
gaudily in candy-colored glory just a few inches from the pavement
of Los Angeles' wide boulevards.
</P>
<P>
   Let the white kids race frenetically; Chicano youths defined
cool by affecting a flamboyant, relaxed look, first with 1930s- and
1940s-era Chevys, today known as ``bombs,'' and later with the
boat-size Chevrolet Imapalas and similar cars. And rather than use
their cars as symbols of rejection of their elders, the lowriders
were conspicuously reverent of their parents' generation. They
embraced the zoot suits and drooping mustaches of the so-called
pachucos, hipsters of a previous generation, as well as Roman
Catholic imagery in their search for an identity with roots in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   These in-your-face cars, in part because they were reviled by
the white mainstream, especially the police here, made a proud but
almost invisible minority highly visible. They became irritating
symbols of ethnic defiance, in effect, giving young Chicanos a
voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had nothing else,'' said Judy Baca, an artist and a
professor of Chicano studies at the University of California at Los
Angeles. ``What they had was a style. They co-opted an American
icon.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowriders have evolved a great deal from the early postwar
years; in fact, they have grown into a worldwide fad, with a
magazine dedicated to the art form, a busy show circuit and clubs
as far away as Japan. They are now, in many instances, almost
freakishly contrived, with murals sprayed on their skins, doors
that fold into casino tables and hydraulic systems that make them
leap in palsied dances. Indeed, lowriders have been pushed almost
entirely off the streets, at least in part because of police
intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   But they have remained a uniquely expressive medium for
Chicanos, statements about their continuing efforts to carve out a
new kind of American identity while resisting assimilation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cars became a mode of social record and a social
protest,'' said Patrick Polk, a folklore expert at the University
of California at Los Angeles. He added that the closest the white
society came to this art form was the hippie vans of the 1960s and
1970s, with their painted peace symbols and dreamy murals of
sunsets.
</P>
<P>
   It is this tradition of artful struggle that is on display at a
new exhibition here at the Petersen Automobile Museum, one of the
largest and most respected car museums in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arte y Estilo: The Lowriding Tradition,'' which runs through
May 28, surveys the history of these highly complex, low-slung
machines, and even includes some of the art's offshoots, such as
lowrider bicycles, model cars and pedal cars. For instance,
``Mother of God,'' an elaborately chromed, customized and painted
Schwinn bicycle, has murals of the Virgin Mary, a pedaling shrine.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition is regarded as a milestone, both for the museum
community and the Chicano community. ``Lowriders are part of the
historical memory of this city, but they really haven't been
recognized in places like this before,'' said Denise Sandoval, the
show's guest curator and a graduate student at the Claremont
Graduate University who is writing her Ph.D. dissertation on
lowriders. ``It was really an important form of expression for
Chicanos. I see more pride among the guys who do this than I do
even among students I teach.''
</P>
<P>
   The show represents the first time the museum has broken free of
the tradition of focusing on mainstream American and European cars
and recognized a different ethnic tradition. ``I've lived through
the Porsches, the Ferraris, the gorgeous cars,'' said Nancy Fister,
the museum's assistant director and an expert in folklore, not
cars, ``but where are the important stories, where's the real
culture?''
</P>
<P>
   She said that there was some resistance to the show from
traditionalists, but that overall the response had been positive.
``Most people feel it's about time we did something like this,''
Fister said, adding that the show had been drawing about 2,000
people each day on the weekends, compared with a turnout of about
500 people on average each day previously.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the more renowned lowrider artists have had
brushes with the law, lowrider clubs and shops are frequently
family-oriented and consciously seek to wean Chicano youths from
the world of gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a bald-headed dude in a lowrider, so I get stopped by the
cops,'' said Albert DeAlba, a second-generation customizer and club
member. ``But if you come to one of our picnics you'll see we're
the opposite of the gangbangers. We bring our kids and we can mix
with each other. It's like a code of honor. We show respect. When
our fathers started doing this, they just wanted to be different
and to be proud.''
</P>
<P>
   And now that the lowriders have, for the most part, left the
streets, they have taken on a new form. ``We use them to tell a
story,'' said Robert Luna, whose elaborate 1939 Chevy, called
``Maldito,'' is featured in the show. ``They are very personal to
us. This, you know, is what we are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maldito,'' in fact, is sort of a Sistine of automobiles, with
extensive air-brushed murals and iconography that touch on personal
and cultural history. There are jail bars, representing brushes
with the law, lots of women, mostly unclothed, and an image of Luna
with his brother, George. Other lowriders frequently incorporate
Catholic imagery as well as images from Aztec mythology, presented
as dramatic tableaus.
</P>
<P>
   One common theme is known as ``Smile Now Cry Later,'' presented
in the show notably on a converted lowrider bicycle, a fatalistic
symbol of how the good times have inevitability been followed by
violence or other troubles for many Chicanos in Los Angeles.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The lowrider grew out of a sense of struggle at a troubled time.
There is some dispute about whether they were developed first in
Los Angeles or New Mexico, which has a thriving lowrider culture,
but there is no doubt that the cars were developed by people
defiantly confronting racial oppression. (Blacks also developed a
parallel lowrider culture in Los Angeles and other cities.)
</P>
<P>
   Fister said that in Los Angeles, many Chicanos returned from the
war, at times highly decorated, but were still not permitted to use
most public swimming pools. In addition, many remembered what had
been referred to here as the Zoot Suit riots of the 1940s, in which
sailors would go into Chicano neighborhoods and provoke fights,
with the police perceived as either useless bystanders or lending a
hand with their own forms of intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   So the Chicanos took junked cars and applied what they had, not
money but craftsmanship. ``They took junk and created art,'' said
Baca. ``The boulevards were not nice places to be, but once the
lowriders started cruising them they became something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandoval said that ``on a broader level, I'm not sure
Mexican-American culture has really been accepted even now in Los
Angeles.'' Latinos outnumber all other ethnic groups here,
including whites, she said. ``We're still seen in a negative light.
This show is just a step in changing that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Baca said she was skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel this is more co-optation than recognition,'' she said.
``You lose some of the cultural milieu just by bringing lowriders
into a place like a museum. Los Angeles is a city where it's been
impossible to get it to identify with its roots. It's a body that
hates its feet. That's what the show is saying to me.''

 &HT;    Bush critical of `weak-kneed' backers as McCain hopes for big
primary turnout
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ While John McCain closed his South Carolina
campaign Friday with a plea to broaden the Republican Party, George
W. Bush criticized some former high-level supporters who have
bolted to his opponent's side.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are some people getting weak-kneed, we need to know
who they are,'' Bush told ABC's ``Good Morning America'' when asked
about defections by such supporters as California Secretary of
State Bill Jones. ``It's good to know who the nervous ones are
before we get into the full process.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, meanwhile, urged voters of every stripe to turn out on
his behalf in today's crucial primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say to independents, Democrats, Libertarians, vegetarians,
come on over. Vote for me tomorrow,'' he said in a hot, packed
gymnasium at the College of Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, talking with reporters, McCain said he hopes to emulate
Presidents Reagan and Clinton, who both were elected with the help
of broad coalitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as all of us painfully hate to admit it, that's what
Clinton did. Clinton went out and got that great center and whipped
us. It's the great center that wins elections,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With two polls released Friday that show Bush opening up a lead
on McCain, the Texas governor expressed confidence. He said a
victory in South Carolina would silence doubts about his candidacy
that arose after his 19-point drubbing by McCain in the Feb. 1 New
Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to win here. You mark my words,'' Bush said as he
campaigned in the state's conservative northwest corner. ``These
people who are getting nervous now are going to regret getting
nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Bush suggested that his ties to establishment Republicans
meant he would be effective as president. He noted that 38 senators
have endorsed him, compared with four for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are asking that question, who can lead America?'' Bush
said. ``Which one of us can stand up and have an agenda and get it
done. They're sick and tired, I'm confident, of people who talk the
talk. They're interested in people who walk the walk.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain spent the day in coastal South Carolina, a stronghold of
support. He largely ignored Bush and said he was at peace about a
decision not to try to match Bush's negative advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The closest McCain came to criticizing Bush came when he said,
``I want to be president not in the worst way, but in the best
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-McCain ads from the Bush campaign and several interest
groups continued to air in the final hours before the polls opened.
</P>
<P>
   Mailings attacked McCain on a range of issues, including the
Confederate flag. He and Bush hold the same position on that issue
_ that South Carolinians should decide whether to take the flag
down from the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   One man outside a McCain rally at the Sun City retirement
community near Hilton Head distributed a flier attacking McCain's
wife, Cindy, who has been treated for addiction to barbiturates.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain was, by turn, optimistic about his chances and
philosophical about the previous two weeks of contentious
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Shrugging off the new polls, McCain said if enough people vote
today, ``I win.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say McCain is more likely to win if more than 350,000
voters turn out today because he needs a significant showing by
independent and Democratic voters. In the 1996 GOP primary, 276,000
people voted.
</P>
<P>
   A record number of absentee ballots already have been cast,
indicating a large turnout. Any registered voter can cast a ballot
in the primary regardless of party affiliation.

A SOFTWARE SHORTCUT IS DRAWING ATTENTION

<P>
   They are among the new, new things: application service
providers, or ASPs, companies in the business of renting software
to corporations over the Internet. And they have generated enormous
buzz recently as their share prices have spiraled higher.
</P>
<P>
   For monthly subscription fees, ASPs give businesses access to
specific software programs on the Internet. Typically, the
applications are used to manage a variety of important business
functions, from customer service to supply chain management.
</P>
<P>
   By using an ASP, a business does not have to buy the programs
itself, store them on servers and hard drives, or maintain and
upgrade them. That allows companies to slash costs in their
information technology departments.
</P>
<P>
   Bullish analysts say the shift toward renting access to software
will change the software industry radically and accelerate
business-to-business commerce on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is huge,'' said Abel Garcia, a portfolio manager at
Waddell &AMP; Reed Investment Management. The Gartner Group, a
consulting firm, estimates that revenues of the ASPs will jump to
$23 billion by 2003, from about $900 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   One threat to the ASP industry is companies' vulnerability to
the kind of cyberattacks that hit Yahoo, Amazon.com and Buy.com
earlier this month. ``Security is definitely an issue,'' said
Adrian Gonzalez, a senior analyst at ARC Advisory Group, an
e-commerce consulting firm in Dedham, Mass. ``If some hacker breaks
in and steals a company's sales contacts or accounting information,
that would definitely drive down the whole industry.'' Though
analysts say many ASPs have expertise in security, their business
customers will have to be convinced that such an attack will not
shut down access to crucial software.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and portfolio managers also raise cautions about
rushing into these risky stocks. Sensing a hot market, a growing
number of companies are describing themselves as ASPs, though the
market may account for only a tiny part of their businesses. Only a
handful are profitable and virtually all of them are priced to the
hilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about everyone wants to be associated with this market,''
Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   The ASP arena has three key segments. First are the companies
that provide the technology platform _ mostly software _ to run the
applications over the Internet. Second are what industry analysts
call pure-play ASPs _ companies that have direct contact with the
business customers and that manage and oversee the process of
moving businesses' software to remote sites. Third are the
infrastructure providers that operate data centers to run the
applications. Some companies, however, wear more than one hat.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the times, most portfolio managers and analysts are
not terribly concerned about exactly when a particular company in
the industry will turn profitable; instead, they look at sales
growth to determine value. ``They're going to grow into their
valuations,'' Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   The blue chip stock is Citrix Systems, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
company whose software provides the technological underpinnings for
much of the industry, allowing computers access to programs running
from remote locations. Citrix's shares have risen 361 percent over
the last 12 months; they closed at $86.50 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Citrix is really a way to play this entire sector, no matter
who wins,'' said Michelle Espelien, an analyst with the Invesco
Funds Group in Denver. Espelien thinks Citrix's software will be
ubiquitous because it is platform-independent, meaning that it
allows applications to run on any type of PC or wireless device.
Currently, over half of the companies that call themselves ASPs use
Citrix technology.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Lurito, manager of the Warburg Pincus Emerging Growth
fund, a big holder of Citrix, expects it to earn 85 cents a share
this year, and at least $1.06 a share in 2001. Sales should rise to
$650 million in 2000 and $1.1 billion next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lurito is also bullish on infrastructure providers, which he
sees as eventually garnering large profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest such company is Exodus Communications of Santa
Clara, Calif. Its main business is Web-hosting, running the servers
and communications gear needed to operate other companies' Web
sites. Exodus stock, up nearly elevenfold over the last 12 months,
closed at $123.4375 on Friday. Analysts expect sales of $660
million this year, and almost double that amount in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Another big Web-hosting provider is Verio Inc. of Englewood,
Colo. Verio stock has risen 408 percent in the last 12 months, to
$73.625 on Friday. Analysts expect sales to be $405 million this
year and to hit $627 million in 2001. Both Exodus and Verio, which
are unprofitable, are investing heavily in servers and network
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Investors may want to to seek out those infrastructure providers
with strong software partnerships, a tactic favored by William G.
Dering Jr., vice president of ASP research at C.E. Unterberg,
Towbin, a New York brokerage firm. Dering recommends
USinternetworking of Annapolis, Md., which has agreements with
vendors like Dell Computer, Microsoft, PeopleSoft, Siebel Systems
and BroadVision.
</P>
<P>
   USinternetworking, which went public in April at $21 a share,
closed on Friday at $63. Dering expects its sales to hit $105
million this year and $225 million in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Interliant, a Purchase, N.Y., provider that went
public last July at $10 a share, has received strategic investments
from BMC Software, Dell and Network Solutions. Dering expects sales
of Interliant, which closed on Friday at $49.75, to hit roughly
$105 million this year and $180 million in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Several money managers have turned to the pure plays _ ASPs that
are expanding rapidly to be able to manage the software and
hardware problems of customers. Breakaway Solutions of Boston now
trades at $103 a share, compared with its initial offering price of
$14 last October.
</P>
<P>
   The FutureLink Corp., of Irvine, Calif., has acquired several
companies in the last six months, and trades at $20.625 a share; 12
months ago, it was just under $2. Breakaway sales are expected to
be $80 million this year and $135 million in 2001. FutureLink sales
are expected to be $123 million this year and about double that in
2001.

LINCOLN WAS DEEPLY INFLUENCED BY A FAITH HE DID NOT EMBRACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the nation drifts into Presidents' Day, there is a strong
suspicion that neither of the men whom it celebrates could get
elected today. One formidable obstacle would be their religious
beliefs _ or lack thereof.
</P>
<P>
   Neither George Washington nor Abraham Lincoln was a believing
Christian, let alone a born-again one. Scratch the religious
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, both men thought government should deliberately
inculcate virtue, befriend religion and submit to an inalterable
morality inscribed in the very nature of things. Scratch the
secular liberals.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln is by far the more interesting case. Rightly or wrongly,
Washington seems like a figure from a distant world, chiseled in
the cold marble rationalism of the 18th-century Enlightenment.
Lincoln, by contrast, served as president during a period, like
ours, of intense religious fervor. No other president is viewed in
such overtly religious terms. His most famous public statements,
the Gettysburg Address and, the Second Inaugural, are suffused with
biblical language and theological concepts. Assassinated on Good
Friday, he was a martyr, a Christ figure, a suffering savior of the
nation and, like the biblical Abraham, a father of his people.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Lincoln was, by the standards and terminology of his day, an
``infidel.'' As a youthful refugee from an ultra-Calvinist Baptist
upbringing, he absorbed skeptical, anti-clerical Enlightenment
writers like Tom Paine, and even entertained some of the
iconoclastic village atheist arguments seldom encountered today
outside the works of the recently retired Episcopal bishop of
Newark, N.J., John Shelby Spong.
</P>
<P>
   As a mature man, however, and a politically ambitious one,
Lincoln could honestly deny that ``I am an open scoffer at
Christianity,'' a charge laid against him, in a classic exercise in
negative advertising, by Peter Cartwright, a famous Methodist
circuit rider and Lincoln's Democratic opponent in the 1846
congressional race.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln's denial rested heavily on the words ``open'' and
``scoffer.'' He had learned to keep his religious views private. He
not only said nothing disrespectful of Scripture or of his fellow
citizens' beliefs; he also came to observe certain proprieties,
renting a pew in church and occasionally attending.
</P>
<P>
   But he never formally joined a church or made a wholehearted
profession of faith, either. Despite energetic efforts to baptize
him posthumously, the evidence indicates that Honest Abe was too
unsparingly honest to set aside his doubts.
</P>
<P>
   All this is wonderfully explored by Allen Guelzo in ``Abraham
Lincoln: Redeemer President'' (Eerdmans, 1999), a book that has
just shared the prestigious Lincoln Prize for the best work in
Civil War-era history with ``Runaway Slaves: Rebels on the
Plantation'' (Oxford University Press, 1999) by John Hope Franklin
and Loren Schweninger. The $20,000 prize is awarded by the Lincoln
and Soldiers Institute of Gettysburg College.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abraham Lincoln: Redeemer President'' is not only about
Lincoln and religion; it is also an effort to treat him as ``a man
of ideas,'' to set him back in the world of Whig ideology and
political thinkers like Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, the
world of anguished seekers like Emily Dickinson and Herman
Melville.
</P>
<P>
   For Guelzo, a dean and professor of history at Eastern College
in St. Davids, Pa., Lincoln was a child of Enlightenment
skepticism, but also ``a typical Victorian doubter,'' for whom the
loss of faith was a cause for regret rather than rejoicing.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Guelzo maintains, religion had a profound impact
on Lincoln's convictions: Lincoln never sloughed off the Calvinist
belief of his family in predestination _ that God had determined
from all eternity who would be saved and who damned _ and this
``dark ancestral conviction that all choices were foreordained''
intersected with the scientific determinism of Enlightenment
thinkers like Bentham to form Lincoln's often-stated belief that
people were driven by events, that humans were cogs in the great
machinery of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Lincoln could refer, as he did time and again, to
``providence'' in ambiguous ways that satisfied believers in a
benevolent father but might also refer to the impersonal workings
of a natural order _ although as the Civil War progressed, he
increasingly felt that ``providence'' to be less remote and more
discernible, though still inscrutable, as a divine personality
guiding particular events.
</P>
<P>
   It was a deep, even cruel, irony, Guelzo finds, that the Great
Emancipator did not believe in free will and that the redeemer
president did not believe in personal redemption. But this
faith-based yet secularized fatalism had great personal
consequences for Lincoln and political consequences for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Fatalism was part and parcel of Lincoln's famous melancholy,
Guelzo believes, but it nurtured resiliency rather than passivity,
a sense of his own destiny as a national leader.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln's equally famous moral uprightness may have been a kind
of compensation, as it was for many other Victorians, for the
threat that determinism posed to traditional underpinnings of moral
accountability. But his sense of human helplessness before the laws
of matter and mind also fueled Lincoln's charity and mercy for
those who fell short.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Guelzo argues, it was Lincoln's ``peculiar
providentialism'' that steeled him to persist in the darkest days
of the war and to yield, against his own reservations, to the moral
imperative of emancipation.
</P>
<P>
   Could a Lincoln be elected president today, especially in view
of this religious nonconformity? The question arose Thursday
evening when Guelzo addressed the Lincoln Group of New York, an
organization of Civil War history enthusiasts, at the 7th Regiment
Armory in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm asked this wherever I go,'' he said. ``Yes, I think he
could be.''
</P>
<P>
   Guelzo is a Republican, to be sure, whose book is dedicated to
Jack F. Kemp, a politician the author admires for trying to recall
Republicans to the heritage of Lincoln. Guelzo also believes that
the issue of abortion is a moral one that, like slavery in 1860, is
``thickly knotted'' into many other issues, especially the future
of a ``procedural liberalism'' that wants government to concern
itself only with due process and remain strictly neutral toward
competing ways of life.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he did not pursue those larger questions. He simply
emphasized Lincoln's ``notion that politics is about right and
wrong, not just about fixing things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something people are yearning for,'' he said, and his
listeners appeared to agree.

   `Boiler Room' Critics Find a Debit Even in the Credits &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, has seen
a few financial schemes in his time. As the lead local prosecutor
in the world's financial capital, he has battled frauds like the
Bank of Credit and Commerce International, which stole billions of
dollars from investors worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   So Morgenthau seemed perfect to review ``Boiler Room,'' the film
about penny-stock abuses on Long Island that opened Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On a cold Tuesday night, Morgenthau joined Manuel Asensio, a
short-seller who has had his own run-ins with penny-stock
promoters, for a preview. Their verdict: you would be better off
taking a flier on a no-name Internet stock then spending $9 and 110
minutes on ``Boiler Room.''
</P>
<P>
   Both praised the scenes in the boiler room itself, as Seth
Davis, the central character, learns how to pitch penny stocks to
unwitting investors, then proves himself a master salesman. But
when Seth (played by Giovanni Ribisi) is not selling, the movie is
a mess, they said. And the last third of the film, when Seth's
father becomes embroiled in a scheme and the FBI gets involved, is
unrealistic to the point of absurdity, Morgenthau said.
</P>
<P>
   Always alert for hype without underlying value, Asensio noted
that while the ads for ``Boiler Room'' lean heavily on Ben Affleck,
one of the most marketable stars in Hollywood, he actually has only
a small role. ``It's a bait-and-switch,'' Asensio said, leaving no
doubt that if he could short this movie, he would.
</P>
<P>
   The chief economist for the New York City comptroller,
meanwhile, has a beef of his own with ``Boiler Room.'' John Tepper
Marlin sued New Line Cinema on Thursday to block release of the
film, which he contends defames him.
</P>
<P>
   The name of the corrupt brokerage firm at the heart of ``Boiler
Room''? JT Marlin. It seems that Ben Younger, the film's director,
worked in the comptroller's office in 1994 and 1995. Marlin and New
Line, a division of Time Warner, did not return calls for comment. &QL;

   A Good Secretary Is Hard to Find &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence R. Ricciardi, senior vice president and general counsel
at IBM, is taking credit for bringing Robert Rubin together with
Sandy Weill and Citigroup. Several months before Rubin resigned as
Treasury secretary last July, Ricciardi asked him to present an
award to Weill at a fund-raising dinner for the public library in
Greenwich, Conn., where Ricciardi and Weill have homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did he accept, but he actually left Washington to go
to work for Citicorp,'' Ricciardi said at the dinner last Thursday.
``Sandy, you can expect a bill for my headhunter's fee in the next
several days _ payable, of course, to the library.''
</P>
<P>
   As Treasury secretary, Rubin said, he had appreciated Weill's
willingness to take part in inner-city causes, including the
opening of a career academy in Washington. Having joined Citigroup
as chairman of the executive committee, Rubin now has a somewhat
different appreciation of Weill, a chairman known for his
headstrong ways. ``He's a pleasure to work with on a daily basis
almost all the time,'' Rubin said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At TCBY, Parting Is Sweet Sorrow &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Frank Hickingbotham's first frozen yogurt store is still open,
in a strip mall on the prosperous western edge of Little Rock, Ark.
But TCBY (The Country's Best Yogurt) Enterprises, the company that
grew over two decades from that single outlet, now includes 3,000
stores in 50 states and 68 foreign countries. Hickingbotham and his
two sons still control 48 percent of the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, the company will change hands. Pending regulatory
approval, TCBY will be sold for $140 million to Capricorn
Management of Stamford, Conn., whose brands include Fields Cookies
and Hot Sam Pretzels.
</P>
<P>
   Hickingbotham can lay claim to creating a market for smooth,
flavored frozen yogurt _ only to see his initial near-monopoly
erode under pressure from fast-food restaurants and supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   The sale price of $6 a share was a 68 percent premium over the
price on Feb. 10, the day the deal was announced. Hickingbotham had
no comments beyond a prepared statement that described the sale as
difficult for his family but ``in the best interest of the
company.'' An aide noted that Hickingbotham also owns
Harley-Davidson motorcycle franchises and a foreign car dealership.
With four small grandchildren and a keen interest in golf,
Hickingbotham should stay busy, the aide said.

GOVERNOR BACKS BOLD PLAN TO BREACH SNAKE RIVER DAMS TO SAVE
SALMON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Northwest)   (bl)  
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Lending political momentum to an idea that would have
been unthinkable in a different era of Pacific Northwest history,
Gov. John A. Kitzhaber of Oregon announced Friday that he favored
breaching four large federal dams on Washington state's Snake River
in an effort to restore endangered salmon populations.
</P>
<P>
   Kitzhaber, a Democrat, became the first major political figure
to endorse the controversial dam-removal proposal, which is
passionately favored by many environmental groups, American Indians
and commercial fishermen, but opposed with equal fervor by farmers
and many others in the interior Northwest who now rely on the tamed
Snake River for barge shipping and electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The debate will almost surely wind up in Congress, sometime
after the Army Corps of Engineers, which operates the dams, issues
its own opinion on the proposal next year.
</P>
<P>
   Just how much influence Kitzhaber's stand will have remains to
be seen, but it is nonetheless an intriguing reflection of changing
times in man's relationship with the rivers of the Northwest, where
some hydroelectric dams generate enormous amounts of power but have
also proven lethal on a major scale to the region's fabled salmon
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, the answer will be a political one _ informed by
good science _ but based on a set of values and on the degree of
economic and ecological risks the region is willing to accept,''
Kitzhaber said in a speech to the American Fisheries Society in
Eugene, Ore. ``It is time that we shoulder our responsibilities and
develop a blueprint for action.''
</P>
<P>
   Construction of Northwest dams was an undeniably epic
engineering achievement, celebrated in Woody Guthrie's songs more
than a half-century ago. But for the last several decades, the
Corps of Engineers has been laboring under federal requirements, to
help dams and the salmon coexist on the Snake but has met little
success.
</P>
<P>
   Despite spending more than $3 billion on projects such as fish
ladders, hatcheries and even a truck-and-barging system that a
Corps brochure describes as ``custom-made to make the trip as safe
and comfortable as possible'' for the fish, the salmon populations
have declined.
</P>
<P>
   The Snake's coho salmon has already been declared extinct, and
every other species of salmon and steelhead in the Snake River is
now listed under the Endangered Species Act. In the early 1800s,
when the explorer William Clark discovered a river ``crouded with
salmon,'' about 2 million adult salmon a year completed the trip
back to their spawning grounds, biologists estimate.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ed Bowles, Idaho's manager of anadromous fish, those that hatch
in fresh water and migrate to the sea, said today that 3,276 Snake
River adult spring and summer chinook returned last year, down from
8,426 in 1998. Fall chinook returns were estimated to be about 400,
slightly up from 306 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Under the dam-breaching proposal now being considered by the
Corps, earth around the dams would be removed, rendering the dams
themselves inoperative and restoring 140 miles of the Snake River
in eastern Washington to a wild, free-flowing condition. Many
scientists and biologists have endorsed dam breaching as the step
that would have the greatest odds of saving the salmon from
extinction.
</P>
<P>
   The dams _ Ice Harbor, Lower Monumental, Little Goose and Lower
Granite _ would be the biggest federal dams ever slated for
removal. But there is no guarantee that the plan would work, and it
would take out of service dams that provide about 4 percent of the
Pacific Northwest's electricity. (Unlike other dams in the region,
the Snake dams are not used for flood control.)
</P>
<P>
   The dams were also constructed to turn Lewiston, Idaho, in the
foothills of the Rocky Mountains and nearly 500 miles from the
Pacific Ocean, into the West's most inland seaport. But virtually
all barge traffic to and from Lewiston would stop if the dams were
breached.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers in eastern Washington have lined up against any
breaching. Republican lawmakers throughout the region have been
generally united against the idea. U.S. Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash.,
who is running for re-election this year, said taking down the dams
would be ``an unmitigated disaster and an economic nightmare'' for
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats have been non-commital on the idea, but
Kitzhaber, who said Friday that the region should feel shame for
losing what were ``once the greatest salmon runs on the face of the
earth,'' has now become the first major political figure from the
region to endorse breaching.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his speech Friday, Kitzhaber said that the region is required
to try to save the fish under the federal Endangered Species Act,
and he warned that if dam-breaching were not attempted, other
alternatives might be even more expensive and disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I am saying to you today is that we have to stop deluding
ourselves into believing that our choices will be easier and
cheaper if we just leave the dams alone,'' he said. ``Our choices
won't be easier. They'll be just as tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitzhaber, who was elected in 1994 and re-elected in 1998, also
criticized, by implication, a range of state and federal officials
who have called for more study of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some will say that we have not done enough science,'' said
Kitzhaber. ``I say that we can always play that card as an excuse
for inaction and as a justification for avoiding tough choices. But
exactly what additional scientific experiment is necessary to
demonstrate that it is easier for salmon to migrate in a
free-flowing river than to negotiate a several hundred foot high
concrete barrier?''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists praised Kitzhaber. ``The governor is providing
what the Snake River salmon need most right now, and that is
political leadership,'' said Rob Masonis, regional director of dam
programs for American Rivers, a group that favors dam removal on
many of the nation's rivers.

PRELUDE TO A `WILL &AMP; GRACE' KISS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   Sometimes a kiss really (BEGIN ITALICS)is(END ITALICS) just a
kiss, even when it's between two men.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's episode of NBC's ``Will &AMP; Grace'' delivers network
prime time's first smooch between two gay male characters.
</P>
<P>
   The liplock between two series regulars, Will (Eric McCormack)
and Jack (Sean Hayes), is not intended to be titillating for either
character, or even for the audience, but rather to make a point
about the television industry's apparent phobia over such moments.
</P>
<P>
   The comedy series centers on Will, an attorney who is gay, and
Grace, a straight interior designer, and their friendship that is
destined never to turn romantic. Jack is a gay buddy of Will's but
not his lover.
</P>
<P>
   The episode, titled ``Acting Out,'' deals with Jack's
disappointment over the fact that a fictional NBC sitcom had
promoted an on-air gay kiss but backed off showing it after all. He
becomes passionate about what he believes is an insult to all gays,
and he enlists Will's support in complaining to the top brass at
NBC.
</P>
<P>
   David Kohan, who created and executive produces the series with
Max Mutchnick, said he applauds NBC not only for airing the episode
during ratings sweeps but for allowing the program to suggest the
network is prudish about such topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It implies a discriminatory policy about its own network,''
Kohan said. ``The truth of the matter is that any problem NBC would
have is allayed by the fact that they're (airing this episode).''
</P>
<P>
   Kohan sees this first kiss as a gentle entree into a possible
romantic story line for Will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think it's a gateway drug,'' he said, laughing. ``But
beyond that, the main purpose of the show is to make people laugh
and entertain them, so if were going to do a show with a kiss,
we're thinking, `How can we have a kiss and make it
entertaining?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to have an audience identify with Will to the
point where, if romance and any kind of physical involvement with a
guy is something that Will craves, the audience will want it for
him,'' Kohan added. ``That's going to be tough, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Swanson, president of Viewers for Quality Television in
Fairfax, Va., had not yet seen the episode but, based on hearing a
description, liked the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sounds darling and very much in the spirit of the show
that we know,'' she said. ``It's certainly being true to the
characters, and that's really what quality television is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Swanson said whenever Will is given a romantic relationship,
``that doesn't mean viewers have to see every kiss between him and
another man. The show is about Will and Grace, not Will and Greg or
whoever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, there are people who will say, `Look out, the whole gay
agenda's being shoved down our throats,''' she added. ``But that's
based on fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Seomin, executive media director for the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance Against Defamation, praised ``Will &AMP; Grace'' for showing
the kiss and said he was satisfied with its non-romantic context.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's remember this is a sitcom, and it needs to be funny to
keep the audience,'' Seomin said. ``If it didn't, it would be off
the air ... and then we wouldn't have that means of educating the
public about gay people in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know (a romantic kiss) is coming, and again, GLAAD would
rather have the show be on the air for seven years _ and in order
to do that, it needs to be funny, rather than doing a kiss in a
bedroom scene that risks not being funny,'' Seomin said. ``It's
coming when it makes sense. They don't want to force it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohan said even with this hurdle crossed, there is no danger of
``Will &AMP; Grace'' becoming another ``Ellen,'' Ellen DeGeneres' show
that lost ratings and was canceled by ABC after DeGeneres and her
character came out as lesbians. The main reason is the roles of
Will and Jack were gay men from the onset.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the thing about `Ellen' was not so much the gayness as
that she started out as one thing and ended up something else,'' he
said, noting that in its first seasons the title character dated
men. ``I wonder what would have happened if the character, instead
of realizing she was a lesbian, decided that her calling was to be
a nun. I think it would have brought the death of the show just as
quickly.'' &QL;

Mullally. &QL;

AFTER PUSHING OIL PRICES UP, MEXICO WANTS THEM TO DROP 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: The name Rogelio Ramirez de la O in 2nd take is correct.) 
(js) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERACRUZ, Mexico _ For two years, Mexico has worked with other
oil producing nations to lift prices, and their efforts have borne
fruit. But in an about face, senior Mexican officials are now
trying to talk prices down.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that lofty oil prices conflict with Mexico's new
economy, which is propelled by exports of cars, televisions and
other manufactured goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is now so integrated into the U.S. economy that it's no
longer in Mexico's interest to rock the boat on oil prices,'' said
Eduardo Lopez, a Mexican who is an analyst at Petroleum Finance
Corp., a consulting firm in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The turnabout on prices has put President Ernesto Zedillo's
government in a ticklish predicament. Leaders of the industrial
world are glaring at Mexico, complaining that petroleum prices are
aggravating inflation. But the Mexican left is accusing the
government of relinquishing a bonanza and giving in to the
imperialists.
</P>
<P>
   That is the incendiary context for Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson's visit to Mexico on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has promised to take a variety of
actions to alleviate a big increase in heating oil prices in the
Northeast. Richardson will discuss the higher oil prices with the
man who helped shape the trend, Energy Secretary Luis Tellez.
</P>
<P>
   At an oil industry convention Friday in Veracruz, on the gulf
coast, Tellez said he hoped that oil prices, now above $30 a
barrel, would soon drop below $25. And he paused to dwell on the
new reality: that manufacturing is a star performer and oil a bit
player in his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is mainly an industrial producer and a provider of
services,'' Tellez said at a news conference. ``We're not a
petroleum country anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The oil equation for Mexico used to be simple: the higher the
world price the better. Oil production contributed nearly 6 percent
to Mexico's total economic output in 1983, but during 15 years of
economic modernization, including the passage of the North American
Free Trade Agreement, oil's contribution has withered to just 1.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
   So although high world petroleum prices mean Mexico this year
will receive billions of dollars in unexpected revenues, they also
threaten to worsen inflation, drive up interest rates and slow
world growth.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, economists say, Mexico's losses from forfeited
exports would far outweigh the short-term profits from $30-a-barrel
oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what many Mexicans don't understand,'' Lopez said.
``People are still thinking in terms of national sovereignty and
national interest. And those concepts are out of touch with the
changes that have taken place.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Oil remains a potent patriotic icon because a high point for
Mexican nationalists came in 1938, when President Lazaro Cardenas
del Rio expropriated the country's petroleum industry. The
identification of oil with popular well-being was strengthened in
the 1970s, when high prices and discoveries of huge petroleum
reserves led President Jose Lopez Portillo to predict an end to
poverty. Mexico's new challenge, he said, was to ``administer
abundance.''
</P>
<P>
   If oil revenues have never eradicated poverty, they still fund
the government: 33 percent of the government's operating funds come
from oil taxes. And when the Asian economic crisis cut world demand
for energy in 1997, prices for Mexico's extra-heavy oil plunged to
below $7 a barrel, causing a crisis in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   With price levels so depressed, ``We as producing countries have
every right to defend our national interests, and that's what we
did,'' Tellez said in an interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In those circumstances, Tellez established secret contacts with
the Venezuelan and Saudi oil ministers, initiating talks that
eventually included the 11 members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries and Norway. The countries announced an
agreement in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in March 1998 to raise prices by
slowing production.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Early last year oil prices began to rise dramatically, but only
since December have dangers become apparent. In recent days, the
Federal Reserve and other central banks in Europe and Japan have
warned that petroleum prices could contribute to inflation, and
Tellez and the Saudi and Venezuelan energy ministers have done
their policy pirouettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``These prices are too high,'' Tellez said Friday. He said a
consensus has now formed among the ministers of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries and Norway that production should now
rise, allowing prices to pull back.
</P>
<P>
   But how soon? The ministers are to meet March 2, but the
production-cut commitments forged in 1998 at Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,
are to continue through March 31. Might the ministers decide on
March 2 to short-circuit the Riyadh agreement and boost oil output
immediately?
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever I say would be very delicate,'' Tellez said. ``But
let me put it this way: We need flexibility.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Mexico's role in influencing world oil prices is surprising,
given its trade partnership with the United States, its repeated
previous refusals to participate in OPEC and President Zedillo's
outspoken advocacy of free markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico's economic policies had been been well-known,'' said
Rogelio Ramirez de la O, a Mexico City-based economic consultant.
``Mexico stood for free trade and had spoken out against price
volatility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the government has helped restrict the market to raise oil
prices, and suddenly officials are getting messages from
Washington, `Hey! You're hurting us, you're fueling inflation,
you're playing with fire!' And they're trying to back out of this
with the least embarrassment possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But the discomfort already appears intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its seems absurd, idiotic and contrary to our national
interest that there could be more revenues and the government says
they don't want them,'' Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, the
presidential candidate heading a leftist coalition, told 10,000
supporters at a rally in Monterrey on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was nothing to spend the money on,'' he said, ``I
could think that increasing the oil exports could be logical. But
I've never seen anybody whose product is selling at a high price
say, `I want you to pay me less.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas is the son of the former president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man in the street thinks Cardenas is right, that we need
that money to build schools and pave streets,'' said Jorge Montano,
a former ambassador to Washington. ``They don't understand that
weeks from now if these high prices continue, the interest rates
will rise, our stock market will fall, and we'll all sink.''
</P>
<P>
   Political cartoons have lampooned Tellez as a puppet manipulated
by the United States. ``Richardson Comes to Pressure Us over High
Crude Prices!'' said a headline in the leftist daily, La Jornada.
</P>
<P>
   But if Richardson intends to urge higher production to ease
prices, he will be preaching to the converted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to tell Mr. Richardson that we'll take measures
that are good for Mexico, not only for the oil sector, but also for
the growth of the rest of our economy,'' Tellez said.
</P>
<P>
   Tellez is hoping that Richardson will help him convince 100
million Mexicans of the wisdom of foregoing short-term profits for
the greater economic good. He has invited congressional deputies
and businesspeople to sit in on their meeting, and has announced
that he and Richardson will speak to reporters afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that the Mexican public understand that there
is a real possibility that world economic growth will slow,''
Tellez said. ``I hope Mr. Richardson will say this loud and
clear.''

BUSH, McCAIN BLANKET SOUTH CAROLINA ON EVE OF PRIMARY 
 
By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
and CLAY ROBISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLINTON, S.C. _ Presidential hopeful George W. Bush, his spirits
boosted by polls that show him ahead in Saturday's South Carolina
primary, barnstormed Republican areas of the state Friday to get
out his vote.
</P>
<P>
   Rival John McCain campaigned at five rallies along the South
Carolina seacost, urging a large turnout of independent and
Democratic voters who may prove crucial to his Election Day hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great about my chances,'' said Bush. ``Our grass-roots
organization is vibrant. People are excited. There is an intensity
level here that is positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Using terms like ``crusade'' and ``revolution'' and standing in
front of a huge U.S. flag, McCain exhorted 1,000 young people at
the College of Charleston: ``We win tomorrow _ and we will win _
there's no way we can be stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   But polls released Friday indicate the momentum McCain earned
after his landslide New Hampshire victory 18 days ago may have
slowed. Four polls of South Carolina voters show Bush with a lead
ranging from 2 percentage points to 12.
</P>
<P>
   The result Saturday almost certainly depends on turnout, whether
the voters are traditional Republican primary participants, the
so-called church and country-club crowd, or swells to include more
independents and Democrats than usual. Any registered voter can
participate, with the only consequence being that voters cannot
also participate in the Democratic presidential caucuses next
month.
</P>
<P>
   A preponderance of traditional voters should be good news for
Bush, just as it was for his father in 1988, when the future
president won almost half of the 195,000 ballots cast. Christian
conservative leader Pat Robertson failed in his bid to attract new
voters and ran third, with 19 percent, slightly behind Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, four years ago, Dole won with 45 percent of the
277,000 votes cast when Pat Buchanan trailed in second place with
30 percent after failing to rev up crossover votes from
conservative independents.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, some analysts believe, McCain's appeal to
non-traditional participants could run up the total vote to even
400,000, a mark that could prove problematic for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports from absentee voting pointed to a record turnout
_ but not in a pattern that is necessarily better for either of the
two main candidates. In Greenville County, the most populous
upstate county, absentee balloting was running almost three times
ahead of 1996. The county is a conservative Republican bastion and
is expected to be Bush's strongest area, but Greenville Mayor Knox
White has endorsed McCain, a senator from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Record absentee voting was also reported in coastal Charleston,
which, with its concentration of military retirees, is expected to
be a center of McCain support.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. Bush told a rally at Presbyterian College in Clinton
that he would not surrender the state's vast military and veteran
vote to McCain, a former Navy pilot who spent nearly six years as a
North Vietnamese prisoner of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to carry the veterans vote in this state because the
veterans of South Carolina heard me loud and clear when I said a
promise made will be a promise kept,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was accompanied by Medal of Honor recipient John Baker and
Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas, a former Air Force flier who was held
captive by the North Vietnamese for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I happened to be with McCain for the last year and a half in
prison camp over there in Vietnam,'' Johnson said. ``I know him
pretty well, and I know him pretty well from the Congress. He can't
hold a candle to George Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference later, Bush nearly refused to engage McCain
on his use of the word ``gooks'' to describe his North Vietnamese
captors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I better not say anything about it lest I be accused of
negative campaigning,'' Bush said. ``I'm confident that at his
press conference here somebody will be asking him to explain
exactly what he meant and if that's appropriate words for a leader.
I wouldn't use the word.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain decried Bush's concerns about Democrats voting in South
Carolina's open primary. As he did in New Hampshire, Bush has
strong support from this state's Republican establishment, which
McCain is intent on shaking up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you share our vision, if you share our hope, if you share
our courage, if you share our commitment ... independents,
Democrats, Libertarians, vegetarians come on over and vote for
me,'' he urged the cheering Charleston crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what happens now, we go on to California. We go on
to Washington. No matter what,'' McCain said told reporters later.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he believes he can attract some independents and
Democrats as well, but Bush said he also fears Democrats may turn
out to vote for McCain to cause trouble for the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this state, there are voters who are coming in for
philosophical reasons, and I welcome them in our primary,'' Bush
said. ``And there are some voters who may be coming in because they
want to send a message to George W. and then go back to vote for Al
Gore.''

 &HT;    S.C. vote `beginning of a long marathon'
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ This may turn out to be _ as some are
describing it _ the most important Republican primary in a
generation. Or it may just be a speed bump on the way to next
Tuesday's GOP vote in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The most unlikely outcome is that today's South Carolina
Republican primary will be what nearly everyone thought it would be
until a few weeks ago: a fire wall, closing the deal for the
party's front-runner and settling the presidential nomi- nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the beginning of a long marathon,'' Texas Gov. George
W. Bush said Friday at Presbyterian College in Clinton, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   That's a far cry from the early expectation that today's vote
would amount to a coronation for Bush, who has the backing of
former Gov. Carroll Campbell's formidable political machine, and
who has been pouring millions of dollars into this state since his
bruising defeat in the Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   If Arizona Sen. John McCain pulls off an upset here, he'll be
the party's new front-runner. But he still will have to contend
with Bush, who has a big advantage in money and en- dorsements.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush wins by a margin as narrow as his lead in most polls
taken over the past week or so, then the vote is not likely to have
a decisive impact on the coming primaries, and South Carolina moves
into speed-bump status.
</P>
<P>
   Only if Bush does surprisingly well _ one benchmark might be
Friday's USA Today/Gallup poll, in which he had a 7-point lead _
will the state be a firewall. Even then, it would be likely to
dampen, but not quench, the spreading flames of McCain's
insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   For South Carolinians, the race has other dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   It's a duel between rival consultants: Bush's Southeast
chairman, Warren Tompkins, a boyhood friend of the late Lee Atwater
and Campbell's right-hand man, is pitted against Richard Quinn, who
has advised McCain since he decided to put a big stake on South
Carolina, and whose son, state Rep. Rick Quinn, is a key McCain
supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Some see it as a generational battle for the soul of the party,
pitting Campbell and the party's establishment against the two
young congressmen, Lindsey Graham and Mark Sanford, who are
supporting McCain and working hard to turn out college-age voters.
</P>
<P>
   The race has been compared to the 1980 primary, when Sen. Strom
Thurmond and Gov. Jim Edwards supported former Texas Gov. John
Connally, and an upstart Greenville congressman _ Campbell _
delivered a crucial victory for Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called a family feud,'' said Campbell, who traveled with
Bush this week. And in fact the competition has worked its way to
the family level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not affecting me a bit. It's affecting my son's
inheritance,'' joked Rep. Skipper Perry of Aiken, a ``Bush man
since 1980'' whose son Richard is Graham's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Lowcountry South Carolina, which has a lot of veterans friendly
to McCain, has been pitted to some extent against the Upcountry,
where religious conservatives lean toward Bush or the third
candidate, conservative broadcaster Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   And core Republican voters, who favor Bush in polls, are
competing with independents and Democrats voting in the open
primary for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Since his New Hampshire upset win, McCain has had the edge in
media and momentum. But he faces a daunting task, especially
depending so heavily on voters who don't regularly pick up
Republican ballots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carroll Campbell knows how to get them out. As for McCain's
supporters, they've got to come in on their own,'' said Francis
Marion University professor Neal Thigpen, a McCain supporter.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican primary won by Bob Dole four years ago drew a
record 276,000 voters. Thigpen estimated that McCain has to turn
out an additional 100,000 voters to win. Other supporters have
tossed out figures that are similar or higher.
</P>
<P>
   That's a huge challenge. But state Sen. Glenn McConnell of
Charleston, a McCain supporter better known nationally for his
defense of the Confederate flag, thinks McCain has the support of a
group of voters who could be crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're folks I don't identify with either party. They're what
I call the surge vote, that usually takes us over the top against
the Democrats, and they're just about to take McCain to the top
over the Republicans,'' McConnell said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the South Carolina Republican party and not the state is
footing the bill, the voting will be on paper ballots. That could
make the process of determining a winner Saturday night tedious.
</P>
<P>
   The state party last week settled a legal dispute by agreeing to
open all polling places, including those in predominantly
African-American precincts. But there is a special situation in
Charleston County, where McCain hopes to do well.
</P>
<P>
   The state party says the Charleston County School Board is
asking too much money to allow for voting at public schools, so
Charleston's 102 precincts have been consolidated in 32 polling
places.
</P>
<P>
   J. Sam Daniel, executive director of the state GOP, said that
while some voters may be inconvenienced, the party has ``done
everything we possibly can to let voters know where to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jack Bass, a Southern political expert teaching at the
College of Charleston, said that in a race this close, voter
confusion in Charleston could make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Not much has been said about the convention delegates who will
be selected in the process, but if the competition between Bush and
McCain remains close, the numbers could matter.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina will send 37 delegates to the party's convention
in Philadelphia. Nineteen delegates will go to the candidate who
wins the overall statewide vote. Three additional delegates will be
selected in each of the state's six congressional districts. So the
second-place finisher overall, if he carries some districts, could
come away with some delegates.

 &HT;    Daytona's big scare
 &HT;    By Rick Minter and Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ NASCAR's experiment with truck racing at
Daytona resulted Friday in a scary and fiery crash by Geoffrey
Bodine.
</P>
<P>
   The wreck, which spun Bodine into the catch fence, sent him,
another driver and five fans to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Seven other drivers and four fans were examined and released at
the track's infield medical center.
</P>
<P>
   Bodine, listed in stable but serious condition at Halifax
Medical Center, was diagnosed with a broken right wrist, minor
burns on his right hand, fractured back vertebrae, facial
lacerations and a swollen right eye. He is expected to be
hospitalized at least a week.
</P>
<P>
   Team spokesman Emmett Byrd said that Bodine appeared ``from head
to toe as black and blue as a person could be.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd said Bodine's brothers, Brett and Todd, visited him in
intensive care. They said that Geoffrey was aware of what was
happening during the wreck and that he said he'd never had another
like it and was concerned about the injured fans.
</P>
<P>
   The wreck came on lap 57 of the first Craftsman Truck Series
race at the historic 2.5-mile track. Coming out of the fourth turn,
rookies Kurt Busch and Lyndon Amick appeared to make contact,
ingniting a 13-truck accident. Bodine's No. 15 Ford _ traveling an
estimated 190 mph _ was knocked into the catch fence, ripping out
the fuel tank and spewing gasoline and flames. The truck then
barrel-rolled down the front straightaway and was struck by Rob
Morgan's truck.
</P>
<P>
   When Bodine stopped, his truck bore no resemblance to its former
self. The only things intact were the driver's compartment and two
wheels. The engine landed more than 100 yards away.
</P>
<P>
   Busch said he became ``the meat of the sandwich'' as a pack of
trucks came off turn four.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to hold my line and stay out of the way,'' Busch said,
``but I ended up rubbing a few fenders, and the incident caused a
huge crash that took out a Winston Cup veteran and a few fans. It
was very unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   The race was stopped for nearly 2 1/2 hours while Bodine was
removed from the wreckage and track officials repaired the fence,
which is a series of wires and posts laced together by thick
cables.
</P>
<P>
   Bodine's brothers were watching the race on television in
Geoffrey's motor home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared stiff,'' Todd Bodine said. ``That was probably
one of the most violent wrecks you'll ever see. I was terrified. To
see something like that just tears your heart out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Crawford, who wrecked before the Bodine incident, said he
had begun to lift off the accelerator in the turns, because the
trucks started handling poorly as the tires wore and because some
of the inexperienced drivers were making too many risky moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drivers naturally are aggressive, but you have to know your
limitations,'' Crawford said. ``Some do; some don't. Some are in
control; some aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Race winner Mike Wallace defended NASCAR's decision to schedule
a truck race at Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an anxious young rookie who helped activate the
wreck,'' Wallace said. ``Other than that incident, the trucks were
phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven drivers were examined and released from the track's care
center. Jimmy Kitchens was taken to Halifax and was still
undergoing tests late Friday. Of the five fans admitted to the
hospital, three were treated and released, while two remained
hospitalized.

<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ The fierce struggle between Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas and Sen. John McCain of Arizona has stirred such keen
interest that strategists on both sides predicted Friday that
turnout on Saturday would far exceed the presidential primary
record of 276,000 who voted in South Carolina four years ago. The
big question was by how much.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the usual primary eve chatter about the latest poll
numbers, there was far greater interest in possible turnout
figures. Strategists in each camp pored over turnout models to try
to discern which numbers would help or hurt their candidate.
</P>
<P>
   One indication of the intense interest in the race came in the
volume of absentee ballots. Counties around the state reported that
absentee ballots were being submitted at as many as three times the
rate of four years ago. Conway Belangia, director of elections for
Greenville County, on the state's northern border, said that by the
close of business Friday, about 2,600 people had voted by absentee
ballot, far surpassing the 700 absentee ballots cast in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Similar numbers were reported in Richland County, which includes
Columbia, the state capital. ``We've got 20 more standing in line
right now,'' said Gloria Wilson, chairman of the voter registration
board. ``And lots of phone calls about where to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's backers said the bigger the turnout the better for them
because they are looking to independents and Democrats who are
allowed to vote in the primary but have not participated heavily in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely need it to be 325,000,'' said John Weaver,
McCain's national political director. ``If it's 325,000 and higher,
then we're in good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Bush forces, confident they have the support of
loyal Republicans in the state, said they were ready for a large
turnout _ just not too large.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to get enough households to survive a 400,000
turnout,'' said Warren Tompkins, Bush's chief strategist here. If
even more voters flood to the polls in what he called a
``Democratic infiltration,'' Tompkins conceded said that could be
trouble for the governor.
</P>
<P>
   But while Weaver exhibited a guarded confidence, he shrugged
when asked what would happen. Despite polls showing Bush may be
slightly ahead of McCain, strategists on both sides said those
surveys do not reliably account for turnout.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the attention has focused on what seems like two
campaigns on parallel tracks _ McCain's appeals to independents and
Democrats and Bush's drive for rock-ribbed Republicans _ the
senator's aides said a crucial element of their strategy is to turn
out veterans who do not always vote. The McCain campaign, citing
the candidate's history as a war hero and as a prisoner of war in
Vietnam, is waging an enormous behind-the-scenes effort aimed at
the state's 375,000 veterans, who make up an estimated 13 percent
of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush and McCain camps seemed a bit on edge _ and
understandably unsure of the outcome. But aides on both sides said
the outcome in South Carolina is crucial. Several went so far as to
say that the nomination may well turn on what happens here. The
next two primaries, on Tuesday in Michigan and Arizona, come so
quickly that the victor in South Carolina might carry his momentum
to those states.
</P>
<P>
   The most passionate appeals came Friday from the candidates
themselves, who dashed around the state pleading with their
supporters to come to the polls. They seemed less interested in
making their pitches for new backers than making sure they rouse
their loyalists to the polls. It was clear a big moment was at hand
because of the convergence of Bush's wife, Laura, and almost all of
his top advisers; the same was true in the McCain camp, where the
senator appeared with his wife, Cindy, and five of their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all comes down to turnout,'' McCain declared as he stumped
across the state, hoping to jolt the electorate as he did when he
delivered a humiliating defeat to Bush in New Hampshire.
``Everything I'm doing today is aimed at voter turnout.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, at a news conference in the town of Clinton, said, ``I
suspect about everybody's made up their mind in South Carolina. Now
it's time to turn out the vote.''

</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, the campaigns went all out in imploring their
supporters to vote, drowning them with mailings, phone calls and
radio and television advertisements. Among the efforts, every voter
identified as a Bush supporter is receiving two telephone calls;
those identified as social conservatives get a third call.
</P>
<P>
   William Brittain, 74, a retired accountant here who is a
registered Republican, said he opened his mailbox on Thursday and
found five mailings from the Bush operation. ``I also got a call
from Bush,'' he said, referring to the thousands of tape-recorded
calls Bush is making in the closing hours to thousands of
registered Republicans here.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain organization has less to spend than the Bush
operation because it is accepting federal money and thus is bound
by a state spending ceiling. But it, too, is blanketing the state
with appeals. As an example, 100,000 previously identified McCain
backers are getting postcards reminding them to vote _ and telling
them the location of their polling place.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The turnout drives are so intense that Henry McMaster, the state
Republican chairman, said he had never seen anything like it. ``I'm
waiting for a plane to come by dropping leaflets,'' he said Friday
afternoon as he looked up in the sky over the state capitol.
``That's all that's left.'' He added: ``I heard one fellow wanted
to give a lot of money to the Bush campaign. But he was told, `Just
get the vote out; we'll get the money later.' I've never heard that
before.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The battle over veterans is particularly unusual, and several
McCain advisers said they are counting on capturing at least 60
percent of the veteran vote, as they did in New Hampshire. The Bush
campaign is so concerned that it has mounted something of a counter
insurgency, questioning McCain's record on military matters and
reminding those voters that Bush served in the Air National Guard.
At a Bush event Friday, Rep. Sam Johnson of Texas took the stage
and said he himself had been in Vietnam, had been a POW for seven
years _ and was a POW with McCain for a year and a half of that
time. ``I can tell you, he cannot hold a candle to George Bush,''
Johnson said of McCain. He added of the governor: ``He was a pilot
in the Texas National Guard. So it's not that he doesn't know the
military. He does.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain is making the veteran turnout drive a particularly
high priority. Volunteers are making calls to 100,000 veterans in
the state, according to aides; the campaign is dispatching former
prisoners of war who back McCain to VFW and American Legion halls
around the state.
</P>
<P>
   Among the callers was Robin Porter, who dialed up a long list of
veterans from McCain's noisy state headquarters here on Thursday
night. ``Mr. Bryant, are you a veteran?'' Porter asked a
prospective supporter. ``I'm also a veteran. Have you thought about
voting on Saturday? You probably will? But you're on the fence? If
I might say, on behalf of John McCain, I believe he's the veterans'
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The candidates' cheery demeanor on the trail Friday, at times
obscured the nervousness of their advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seemed upbeat as he repeatedly asserted that he was going
to win. Unlike the closing days in New Hampshire, the governor
maintained a furiously busy schedule that had him in front of
television cameras at 6:30 a.m. in Charleston and did not deposit
him at his hotel in Greenville until about 10:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere was one of attention to detail _ and taking no
chances. When bad weather forced a news conference in Clinton to
more indoors, workers hastily taped more than a dozen Bush posters
over the chalkboard behind Bush, lest the television and still
cameras catch him against a drab green backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   Bush acknowledged at the first rally of the day, at Presbyterian
College in Clinton, the importance of the coming moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow's a big day in American politics,'' Bush told a crowd
of hundreds. ``And I'll tell you why it's a big day: When South
Carolina goes to vote for George W. Bush, it's the beginning of the
end of the Clinton era in Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, and his surrogates, continued his appeals for a large,
untraditional voters turnout in the Republican primary Saturday.
``I say to independents, Democrats, libertarians, vegetarians-come
on over. Vote for me,'' McCain thundered. No matter the outcome
Saturday, McCain told reporters he would carry his campaign forward
to the set of major primaries in two weeks, ``No matter what
happens, this race is decided on March 7,'' he said. ``We're very
optimistic. I could not be happier.''

GORE WALKS POLITICAL TIGHTROPE ON TRADE DEAL WITH CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: 2nd Take is scheduled to move by 9:30 p.m. ET)  
(Duplication warning: also moving in `p' category)

 By DAVID E. SANGER and KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just a day after reassuring union leaders that he
would negotiate a tougher trade deal with China if elected
president, Vice President Al Gore had to write a letter Friday to
reiterate his support for the trade agreement that President
Clinton is trying to push through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, to a leading business lobby, underscored the
politically agonizing position Gore finds himself in as he tries to
mollify two groups he desperately needs in the election, business
executives who have pressed for the accord and union members who
want to defeat it.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to court both, Gore has in the last few days led each
side to believe that it has his support in one of the nation's most
contentious trade disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's letter, to the National Association of Manufacturers, was
sent after White House officials had been left fuming by his
appearance before the AFL-CIO on Thursday in New Orleans. Although
Gore told the union officials that he supported the China deal, the
labor leaders said he had also reiterated in his closed-door
meeting that, if elected, he would negotiate tougher accords that
include guarantees that countries like China would respect labor
rights and environmental standards.
</P>
<P>
   Neither issue is explicitly addressed in the deal finalized in
Beijing in November.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore's comments in New Orleans circulated here on Thursday,
some administration officials who are working to win passage of one
of the biggest trade deals in history expressed fears that his
implicit criticism of the shortcomings could give ammunition to
those looking to sink the pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't exactly deft,'' an economic adviser to Clinton said
Friday. ``There was a clear argument to make about the national
security importance of this agreement, and he failed to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   One Democratic leader who has spoken to Gore and Clinton said:
``He's in an agonizing spot. He can't afford to alienate the
unions, and they've made this deal public enemy No. 1. And he can't
break with the president. So he's all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether Gore had been pressured by the White
House to write the letter or whether he did so after his own
campaign officials feared that he had veered too far toward the
opponents of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But even in the letter he tried to walk a fine line. ``As I have
said publicly and privately,'' he wrote, ``I support the agreement
reached by our administration on the terms under which China will
be permitted to accede to the World Trade Organization.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an effort to keep union supporters from bolting, he
added: ``I agree with President Clinton that future trade
negotiations ought to include in the fabric of the agreement both
labor and environmental components.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future,'' he added, ``I will also insist on the
authority to enforce workers' rights and environmental protections
in those agreements.''

IN HIGH-STAKES GAMBLE, S.C. CONGRESSMAN GOES ALL OUT FOR MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ John McCain is not the only candidate on his
campaign bus who has a large stake in whether his ``great crusade''
goes forward or fails in South Carolina on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the senator swept into the state with his populist
assaults on special interests, Rep. Lindsey O. Graham has been at
his side like a younger brother, working his heart out day and
night. Graham, a rising star in the state Republican Party,
sometimes looks as if he slept in his clothes. But he never fails
to rev up the crowds with his down-home flights of rhetoric
designed to harness home-state pride and stoke anti-establishment
fervor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's what I think,'' the 44-year-old congressman drawled
Friday, staring out at a rally here packed with students. ``We're
going to rock their world tomorrow.'' As the crowd roared, he
purred, ``What we're going to do tomorrow is going to be in books,
it's going to be in political science books.
</P>
<P>
   When Graham decided in the summer of 1998 that he would sign on
to the McCain campaign, the Arizona senator was an obscure
long-shot candidate. And who could foresee that the GOP primary
would become a life-and-death battle in South Carolina and spark a
kind of civil war in the state's Republican Party, pitting Graham
against some of the more entrenched party figures who back Gov.
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But as the race has become bitter he hasn't flinched from the
fight. Instead he has embraced wholeheartedly that this is a
struggle for the heart and soul of the Republican party, and he is
playing to win. ``I'm competitive,'' he says. ``I'm a lawyer. I'm
competitive by nature.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes the stakes particularly high for Graham is that he
makes no secret of his intent to run for the Senate seat that Strom
Thurmond is expected to vacate in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``This job doesn't come open very often here,'' Graham says in
an understatement _ Thurmond has been a senator longer than Graham
has been alive. ``When the train leaves the station, buddy, it
don't come back in our lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is sure that the last month has been an unmitigated
plus for Graham. And not everyone in the party has appreciated
Graham's die-hard support for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would assume that all this TV time and exposure has helped
run up his name ID among people in the state,'' said Warren
Tompkins, Gov. George W. Bush's chief South Carolina strategist.
``From that standpoint, it's probably a positive effect. But if
McCain is not our nominee and doesn't win South Carolina, he's
aligned himself with issues that McCain is for that would put him
out of synch with mainstream Republicans in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Graham will ``have to do some fence-mending'' with
social conservatives in particular.
</P>
<P>
   But Graham brushes off any suggestion that his support for
McCain could come back to haunt him _ or that any of his fellow
politicians will seek revenge. ``What happens to me depends on me _
not anybody else _ and the people. All I ask for is to be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Slumped on the campaign bus between appearances for McCain, he
says, ``I'll never be coronated if he wins. If he doesn't win,
here's what I'll tell people: I've got no regrets. John McCain,
win, lose or draw, has brought out a new group of voters. He has
inspired people.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, what has happened in South Carolina mirrors what
has occurred across the nation in this surprising struggle for the
Republican presidential nomination. The GOP establishment has
rallied behind Bush _ including Thurmond, ex-Govs. Carroll A.
Campbell Jr. and David Beasley, and most other senior state
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Graham is only the most prominent of a group of ``Young Turks''
who have aligned with McCain. Rep. Mark Sanford, a fellow member of
the House ``Contract with America'' class of 1994, is also stumping
for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sanford is making good on his term-limits pledge and is retiring
after this term. On the McCain bus, the senator and his staff make
no secret that they could envision Sanford as South Carolina's
governor someday. McCain even slipped tellingly at a Columbia rally
Thursday night and referred to Sanford as Graham's ``running
mate.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, Sanford, 39, seems somewhat relieved to be
coming home after all the convulsive ups and downs of the
Republican majority in the House. Asked whether he would run for
governor, he said, ``I've learned in life never to rule anything
completely out, but I say there's a 99 percent probability I'm not
going to.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on board with McCain are Terry Haskins, the South Carolina
House speaker pro tem, and Rick Quinn, the majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is Graham who showed his rebel streak early in Congress
when he joined a coup plot against former House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, and it is Graham who has been the star and has used the
statewide platform the campaign gave him to the fullest.
</P>
<P>
   At some rallies, he is just plain funny. At Clemson College one
night as he was introducing McCain and Gary Bauer, the former
presidential candidate who endorsed McCain this week, he quipped,
``You know what I like about these guys? They're the only guys in
politics that I'm taller than.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that same day he was holding audiences spellbound with
an introduction of McCain that made him sound like a messiah. ``God
has put John McCain here for reason,'' he said. ``Really, he
shouldn't be alive.''
</P>
<P>
   He told of the senator's ejection from his stricken bomber over
Vietnam when he was a Navy pilot, his years as a prisoner of war,
of how he ``suffered like very few people have suffered for his
country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that God has placed John McCain at the right spot at
the right time in our history,'' Graham said. ``Those who have
suffered a great deal sometimes have a great ability to heal.''

 &HT;    Fast practice fortifies Jones for Busch race
 &HT;    By Rick Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The two zeroes painted on the doors of
Buckshot Jones' Pontiac could be misleading.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a Busch Grand National Series driver from Monticello,
topped the speed charts in one of the last test sessions before
today's 300-mile race. He qualified fourth for the NAPA Auto Parts
300 and said he has his best shot yet at winning his series'
premier event.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a good car, a good engine, and I've got more
experience,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   And he'd really love to park his No. 00 Pontiac in victory lane
this afternoon. ''It ranks right up there with Atlanta for me. I've
always wanted to win at my home track, but everybody wants to win
at Daytona.''
</P>
<P>
   The Busch series, which is NASCAR's No. 2 series, has lost some
of its stars to the major-league circuit, but Jones doesn't expect
any drop in the competition level.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's going to be more competitive than ever,'' he
said. ''Yes, we lost Dave Blaney, Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Matt
Kenseth to Winston Cup, but there's a lot of new talent coming in
from other series.''
</P>
<P>
   PULLING DOUBLE DUTY
</P>
<P>
   The starting lineup for the Busch race is typical for Daytona _
loaded with big names from other divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup drivers doing double duty include Kenseth, Joe
Nemechek, Kenny Irwin, Mike Skinner, Scott Pruett and Michael
Waltrip.
</P>
<P>
   Hut Stricklin, currently without a Winston Cup ride, used his
years of experience at Daytona to put an unsponsored Pontiac on the
pole.
</P>
<P>
   Former Craftsman Truck Series champion Ron Hornaday, who took
over the No. 3 Chevrolet that Dale Earnhardt Jr. vacated when he
moved to Winston Cup, starts second. Jay Sauter and Kevin Harvick
start fifth and seventh, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   DODGE TEAM TAKES SHAPE
</P>
<P>
   Dodge racing officials have scheduled a news conference today to
announce some of their drivers for 2001. Speculation in the garage
area is that the Bill Davis Racing team, with Ward Burton and
Blaney, and Richard Petty's team, with son Kyle Petty and John
Andretti, will be a part of Dodge's return to the Winston Cup
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Elliott also is believed to be teaming with Ray Evernham at
Dodge, but that announcement isn't expected until at least the
Atlanta race.
</P>
<P>
   Crash `sickening'
</P>
<P>
   The truck Geoffrey Bodine crashed Friday belonged to Georgia
businessman Billy Ballew, who lives in Blue Ridge and owns a car
lot in Marietta, Ga. Ballew said Dalton's Bobby Gill was his first
choice for driver, but Bodine got the ride because he was able to
bring sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   Ballew described the crash as ``sickening.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still sick,'' Ballew said hours after the wreck. ``I'm
just really concerned for Geoffrey and for the fans who were
injured.''
</P>
<P>
   BRIEFLY . . .
</P>
<P>
   In winning the Craftsman Truck Series race, Mike Wallace, the
middle brother of the racing Wallace family, ran his Daytona
victory total to two. His other win came in an ARCA race in 1994. .
. . Dale Earnhardt continued his mastery of the International Race
of Champions events at Daytona. For the sixth time in the past nine
years, Earnhardt won the 40-lap IROC race, which features top
drivers competing in identically prepared Pontiacs.

EDITORIAL: SOUTH CAROLINA'S SHOWDOWN  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Feb. 19:
</P>
<P>
   Rarely in recent presidential elections has there been a more
pivotal vote than the one in the South Carolina primary on
Saturday. The entire Republican presidential selection process
seems balanced on a knife's edge, with a possibility of either Gov.
George W. Bush or Sen. John McCain emerging as the overwhelming
favorite to win the nomination. The verdict in South Carolina could
also shape the party, its demographic composition and perhaps even
its philosophy for a long time. Yet the outcome on the eve of the
election is entirely unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   Until his disastrous defeat in New Hampshire two and a half
weeks ago, Bush was the prohibitive favorite to win in South
Carolina. But McCain's Granite State triumph fired up his campaign,
and for a time he surged ahead of the Texas governor in South
Carolina opinion polls. Now the polls are extremely close, with
some showing Bush ahead again. At the least, the governor's barrage
of negative attacks appears to have stopped the stampede to McCain.
A sweeping Bush victory might revive his status as front-runner. A
big McCain victory might well make him unstoppable, as he said this
week. But a squeaker might redouble both men's efforts in other
states where McCain has been moving upward with his brand of
maverick and moderate politics.
</P>
<P>
   As many analysts have noted, the uncertain factor in South
Carolina this year is turnout. McCain has stirred support among
independents and Democrats who say they plan to vote in the
Republican contest, many for the first time. If their participation
swells the turnout above normal levels, it could put the Arizona
senator over the top even though he is well behind among
Republicans alone. The contest has thus evolved into a curious
clash of two visions for the party. McCain's encompasses the old
Reagan-era coalition, which brought in people not normally
Republican in the past. Bush's vision is more exclusively focused
on the party's traditional base.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Bush has also begun to complain about Democrats voting
in the Republican primary, as state rules allow, presumably to
choose a weak nominee for the fall. That interpretation is probably
a misreading of a phenomenon that could bring new voters into the
GOP fold. It is also an ironic switch for the Texas governor, who
started out last year by presenting himself as the one who could
broaden the party to include minorities and others.
</P>
<P>
   Although South Carolina is not especially representative of the
ethnic and ideological mix in the rest of the country, its primary
election offers a fascinating snapshot of what could become larger
trends this year. Like voters in much of the country, South
Carolinians have become more prosperous, high-tech-oriented and
moderate in their political and economic views. Both McCain and
Bush have had to move beyond tax cuts to emphasize education and
retirement benefits, a rising theme among suburban voters in the
post-segregation South and in other parts of the United States. In
Washington, congressional Republicans are taking note of the trends
and moderating their own positions, to the point of promising to
spend more money on education than President Clinton proposed in
his State of the Union Message.
</P>
<P>
   The political forces ebbing and flowing in South Carolina are
making the Republican race unsettled and exciting. Even for
Democrats and others who do not agree with much of what either
McCain or Bush say, this is a healthy contest of ideas that is
likely to clarify the choice that voters will be making in
November.

CORA HAS PLENTY ON HIS MIND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ As Alex Cora begins his quest to become the
Los Angeles Dodgers' starting shortstop, he does so with a slight
concern about everything being right with his body.
</P>
<P>
   He was diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat last year and had a
radio-ablation procedure done in November to correct it. It helped,
but not entirely. So two weeks ago, Cora had the procedure done
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I'm down here now,'' Cora, 24, said of his early
arrival to Dodgertown. ``It's just to make sure everything was all
right.''
</P>
<P>
   In layman's terms, the electrical field around Cora's heart was
shorting-out, Dodgers club physician Dr. Michael Mellman said. From
his groin, Cora had a catheter placed through his legs and to his
heart. The tip of the catheter has a tiny transmitter that sends
waves and burns the area from where the electrical shortage
emanates.
</P>
<P>
   The process was done in Los Angeles on Feb. 4, and Cora was out
of the hospital a day later. A week later, he got married. Now,
already running and ready for action, he must prove he can hit
major-league pitching to beat out Juan Castro and Jose Vizcaino.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been looking for this opportunity, coming to training
camp and know I have a chance to break camp with the team,'' said
Cora, who has a .143 average in 40 games with the Dodgers. ``I know
what I have to do. When there's a runner at second, move him over.
I have to do the little things.''
</P>
<P>
   Devo's Da Man: With speculation Todd Hollandsworth will contend
for the center-field job, Dodgers manager Davey Johnson wanted to
state that Devon White is the center fielder entering spring
training. Of course, that could change.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both pretty good players, and I'm going to let them go
out there and see,'' Johnson said. ``Maybe a combination of those
guys, or maybe one guy is going to take it outright. But at this
point, if Devo's healthy physically, and in a good frame of mind
and prepared to do the things he's capable of doing, I don't think
anyone questions his ability.''

   The head of the World Trade Organization, Mike Moore, said he
was optimistic that China could be admitted to the group this year.
Moore, speaking at a news conference in Beijing, also made clear

   Loss Increases at Global Crossing
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing said its fourth-quarter loss more than tripled
because of costs to expand its undersea fiber optic networks and
absorb recent acquisitions. Sales to consumers fell, but sales of
communications services to other carriers and large corporations
rose. Web-hosting sales soared 196 percent. Shares of Global
Crossing fell $8.6875, to $52.375.

   Mexico's Too Successful Oil Policy
</P>
<P>
   For two years, Mexico has worked with other oil nations to
increase petroleum prices. After a successful campaign, senior
officials have done an about face and are trying to talk the world
price down. This has put President Ernesto Zedillo's government in
a delicate position: Leaders of the industrial world are
complaining that petroleum prices are aggravating inflation, while
the Mexican left is accusing the government of relinquishing an oil
bonanza by giving in to the imperialists.

   UBS of Switzerland replaced the head of its private banking

   Profit Declines 38 Percent at Saab
</P>

   Saab, the Swedish defense company with products ranging from
warplanes to radar systems, said its fourth-quarter profit fell 38

for export.
</P>
<P>
   Monetary Policy Anger Brazilians
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's central bank left interest rates unchanged at 19
percent for the fifth time since September, angering many
Brazilians who are growing impatient with the austere monetary
policy. Under the guidance of the bank's president, Arminio Fraga,
the bank has managed to restore confidence in Brazil's currency,
which was devalued a year ago. But the bank's efforts to contain
inflation with rates that are among the highest in the world are
increasingly viewed as radical medicine for an economy that has
stagnated for two years.

CREATIVE DIFFERENCES SPLIT DESTINY'S CHILD

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ If R&AMP;B pop group Destiny's Child should win a Grammy
or two Wednesday, expect to see a couple of new faces on the podium
accepting the statuettes.
</P>
<P>
   LaTavia Roberson and LeToya Luckett have left the group citing
creative differences, according to Columbia Records, the Houston
band's record label. They will be replaced by Farrah Franklin, 18,
a dancer in the video for the single ``Bug A Boo,'' and Michelle
Williams, 19, a one-time back-up singer with hip-hop vocalist
Monica.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two new members are going to be a part of this group for a
long time,'' said a spokesperson for Columbia Records. ``Destiny's
Child is not finished, no matter what Internet rumors might say.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin and Williams will appear with remaining members Kelly
Roland and Beyonce Knowles in the group's upcoming video, ``Say My
Name.''
</P>
<P>
   All four children of destiny will also be at the Grammy Awards
next week where they've been nominated for best R&AMP;B performance by
a duo or group with vocals and best R&AMP;B song, for the single
``Bills, Bills, Bills.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing is curious for Destiny's Child, which enjoyed its
greatest success last year with its second album, ``The Writing's
on the Wall,'' which has sold more than 2 million copies since its
release last July.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Grammy appearance, Destiny's Child will embark on
a two-week tour of Europe on March 5 before returning to the United
States for two shows at Madison Square Garden with Brian McKnight.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The original foursome recently won an NAACP Image Award for
outstanding duo or group.
</P>
<P>
   Destiny's Child has followed in the footsteps of more
established acts TLC and Salt n' Pepa. All are female harmony
groups that can weave R&AMP;B love ballads with the occasional gritty
rap rhymes about how a man should treat them.

CANDIDATES MAKE FINAL PUSH IN SOUTH CAROLINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ With the Republican presidential nomination
possibly hanging in the balance, George W. Bush and John McCain
both used the final day of campaigning before Saturday's primary to
seek support from Democrats and independents even as each
confidently claimed to be the best person to beat the Democratic
nominee this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to win tomorrow, I believe that,'' Bush said at a
rally in Clinton, after belittling some former supporters who
switched this week to McCain as ``weak-kneed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, on a local television broadcast Friday night, made one of
his most overt appeals yet for Democrats to support him in the
primary, saying he had always enjoyed strong support from
conservative Democrats when running in Texas. But he also repeated
his concern that Democrats will flood the primary with support for
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, whose hopes hinge on that flood tide from outside
Republican ranks, was equally confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we win tomorrow, there's no way we can be stopped,''
McCain told more than 2,000 people at the College of Charleston in
one of the most raucous rallies of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A third candidate, Alan Keyes, who has been in low single digits
in the polls, campaigned in the upstate region, with the size of
his vote a potential factor in a close race.
</P>
<P>
   With polls variously showing that the contest is a dead heat or
that Bush is ahead, the race could well be decided not on a
specific issue but on the shifting perceptions of Bush and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, once considered the inevitable nominee, has been fighting
since his defeat in the New Hampshire primary to retain the backing
of the party establishment, even though lately he has been bashing
the party ``insiders.'' The Bush campaigners fear a loss here could
undercut their hopes in the primary states that follow _ many of
them open-primary states like South Carolina _ and prompt party
leaders to reconsider the viability of his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who rose rapidly in the polls largely because of his
reformer image and his life story as a former Vietnam prisoner of
war, has portrayed himself lately as the new face of the Republican
Party. In his appeal to voters here, he is walking a fine line
between seeking the votes of liberals and moderates while assuring
conservatives who dominate the Republican Party that he is one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   In an ironic twist to the election, the effort by the
establishment of the South Carolina Republican Party to attract new
members by allowing anyone to vote in the GOP primary could open
the door for a McCain victory. Signs are posted outside McCain
rallies that say: ``Democrats and Independents: Vote for McCain
Feb. 19.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictions varied wildly about how many independents and
Democrats would turn out. As McCain and Bush talk about defeating
the Democratic nominee and reveal positions that are out of synch
with the Democratic Party, they may persuade most Democrats to stay
home. It also remains, at best, an open question whether black
Democrats, a bulwark of the Democratic Party here, will vote in
significant numbers, particularly since Bush and McCain have stayed
clear of a touchstone issue for many blacks: whether the
Confederate flag should fly over the South Carolina State House.
</P>
<P>
   The polls are open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. With voting on a
Saturday, and with the enormous publicity the primary has won,
expectations are for a record turnout. In 1996, the primary voter
turnout was 276,000. Republican Party officials said the turnout
this time could be over 400,000, especially if independents and
Democrats vote in large numbers. Preparing for any contingency, the
Republican Party has printed 1 million ballots.
</P>
<P>
   McCain clearly is hoping for such a large turnout, since his
success depends on a big showing of non-Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say to independents, Democrats, Libertarians, vegetarians,
come on over, vote for me!'' McCain said at the College of
Charleston rally, where a swirl of convention-style confetti rained
down on the senator after his speech inside a packed, old
gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   If absentee ballots are an indication, voter turnout will be
heavy. In some areas, including Charleston County, election
officials reported that requests for the ballots were more than
twice as heavy as four years ago. And Saturday's weather is
forecast to be cloudy with a slight chance of rain, heartening
McCain supporters who are counting on a strong turnout and were
worried about earlier predictions of a downpour.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, both Bush and McCain have been drawing large,
enthusiastic crowds as they traveled the seacoast from Hilton Head
to Myrtle Beach, and to the booming belt upstate that includes
Greenville and Spartanburg.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's appeal was apparent when he appeared earlier this week at
Pawleys Island, in the Tara ballroom at a massive development
called Litchfield Beach and Golf Resort. Bush, fairly shouting out
his campaign vows, told the packed crowd of about 800 that he
wasn't conceding the veterans' vote to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm running against a veteran. I'm one, too,'' said Bush, who
served in the Texas Air National Guard and did not see combat duty
or go to Vietnam. Bush told MSNBC-TV this week that he had not read
any book about McCain's ordeal as a POW, including McCain's
best-selling autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's comment about being a veteran underscores what seems a
pattern here _ this will be a vote driven more by the character
traits of the candidates than by their disagreements on issues.
</P>
<P>
   When voters were randomly interviewed across the state, it was
the rare South Carolinian who said he liked one candidate or the
other mostly because of a specific issue. Instead, residents often
said they like Bush because they admire his father and his values,
or that they like McCain because of his independence and his
courage as a prisoner of war.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Breznicky, asked whether there was any issue that led him to
back Bush, responded: ``None, really. I still think we are feeding
off the economy that his dad had a lot to do with.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who for months repeated his mantra that he was a
``compassionate conservative'' who wanted to cut taxes, has spent
much of the past week describing himself as a ``reformer with
results,'' an effort to steal some of McCain's thunder on the
issue. Bush unveiled a repackaged campaign reform plan that banned
unlimited contributions by corporations to political parties. Bush
also sought to turn the tables on the man he called ``Chairman
McCain,'' saying that the Arizona senator violated the spirit of
campaign laws by ``rolling over'' more than $2 million from his
Senate campaign to his presidential effort.
</P>
<P>
   When making that charge, Bush does not mention that he has
chosen to bypass the federal spending limits by rejecting federal
matching funds, which has enabled him to collect more than $70
million. But to the consternation of some of his supporters, Bush
has already spent about $50 million even though Saturday's primary
is only the fourth contest of the campaign. If Bush loses, he may
find that his fund-raising prowess diminished as McCain continues
to gain financial strength through Internet-based contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush attacks on McCain, made over the airwaves on radio and
television and in leaflets stuffed under automobile windshield
wipers, appeared to be having some impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain says he has been an insider and he's been there for 18
years, so what's he doing?'' said Miriam Servant, of Pawleys
Island, echoing an attack made by Bush himself. She said that
McCain has said he would raise taxes, although the senator has said
his plan cuts tax for the lower and middle income.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's potential problem was apparent down the coast in the
tiny fishing village of McClellanville, which was bypassed by the
Bush caravan late Thursday night. In a random interviews at
Buster's Porchside Dining, people invariably said they were
attracted to McCain by his life story as a former Vietnam prisoner
of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of (Bush's support) is Daddy's family name, a lot of
people think that,'' said Chauncey Densmore, an independent who
plans to vote for McCain. Asked why he is the backing McCain,
Densmore, a carpenter, gave an answer echoed by many people
interviewed in South Carolina: ``It's just character in general.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign well understands that the candidate's appeal
is based greatly on the five and a half years that he spent as a
prisoner of war. Throughout Charleston Friday, windshield wipers
and doorknobs were outfitted with flyers titled ``The John McCain
story.'' The campaign's ads, targeted to this state's heavy veteran
population, show McCain as a prisoner in Vietnam, and posters at
every rally are filled with the words courage, integrity and honor.
</P>
<P>
   For many Republicans, the key question in the election was
whether Bush or McCain stood a better chance of beating the
Democrat in the general election. Bush maintained that the
Democratic establishment was urging party members to support McCain
because the Democrats don't want to face Bush in the fall. But
McCain, citing polls that showed him with a large lead in a matchup
with Vice President Al Gore, says he will be a stronger GOP
candidate.

A PUSH TO AGREE ON A DRIVE-THROUGH FUTURE

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 20)  
 (af)  
 By AMY ZUCKERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine your car as a digital appliance, like a laptop computer
or a cellular phone. Picture rolling through any toll plaza in
North America without having to stop _ and picking up your e-mail
as you pass.
</P>
<P>
   Warnings of traffic jams or poor road conditions ahead pop up on
your dashboard, along with a map of the best alternate route.
Drive-through fast food, fuel, a wash and wax for the car, parking
in a downtown garage, are all charged to your monthly bill without
human intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Those images and more are the vision held out by proponents of
what are called ``intelligent transportation systems.'' Now largely
confined to automated toll collection, like the EZ-Pass system on
many toll roads and bridges in the Northeast, ITS depends on
short-range communication between a small radio transponder in the
vehicle and fixed stations on the roadside.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers say the industry is on the brink of achieving much
of its grand plan of convenience and efficiency for motorists and
truckers, especially now that the government has set aside a
valuable new patch of the frequency spectrum, the 5.9 gigahertz
band, for their use.
</P>
<P>
   But first, analysts say, two crucial questions must be settled:
What nationwide, industrywide technical standard should be
established? And can the mainly small companies in the industry
find the resources to make the leap on their own, or must they form
alliances with deep-pocketed partners in the cellular phone
industry?
</P>
<P>
   The four main vendors of the systems are scheduled to meet this
week to discuss those issues. Joining executives of Amtech Systems,
a division of Intermec, at their offices in Dallas will be
representatives of the Sirit Corp. of Markham, Ontario; Mark IV of
Mississauga, Ontario; and Highway Transportation Management
Systems, a unit of Raytheon, the military contractor based in
Marlboro, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the four companies have operated in a relatively
small but safe market for limited-purpose transponders, according
to Dick Schnacke, international standards manager at Amtech.
Schnacke put Amtech's sales to toll agencies at about $85 million
last year, and it is one of the two leading vendors, along with
Mark IV, maker of EZ-Pass.
</P>
<P>
   But as ambitions for multipurpose systems soar, it is not clear
whether the manufacturers will be able to realize all their
ambitions unaided. ``You can build equipment, but you may not have
the infrastructure in place to provide services,'' Schnacke said.
</P>
<P>
   ITS America, a trade association that promotes wider adoption of
the systems, sees great promise in marrying the technology with
cellular telephony, according to Paul Najarian, the group's
telecommunications director. Cellular systems are already in place
nearly everywhere in the country; a link would open the possibility
of partnerships with deep-pocketed giants like Qualcomm, Motorola
and Lucent Technologies. So far the major cellular companies have
not said whether they have any interest.
</P>
<P>
   Making a cellular connection, Najarian said, would ``allow us to
do `p-commerce,' point-specific transmission from a Burger King,
for example, or to download from specific points like the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Many companies are already at work on potential in-car Internet
applications, he said, among them America Online, whose recently
acquired MapQuest unit aims to provide customized maps to
motorists, and SmartMove USA, a Belgian-owned company that has
developed a technology to download an entire Java application into
cars as they pass a transmission point.
</P>
<P>
   But some vendors worry that marrying cellular systems may erode
their own products' unique advantages. ``The dedicated short-range
communication medium allows you to make a dedicated transaction
from a known location,'' Schnacke said. ``Cellular can't do that.
It can get within 100 feet, but that's not good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   High on the agenda for the Dallas meeting, he said, is the
question of whether to expand the industry's standard-setting
circle to include cellular companies.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Under a mandate from Congress, the Department of Transportation
is financing the development of more than 100 related technical
standards, from basic transponder design to highway safety and
navigation applications, all aimed at so-called national
interoperability _ in other words, having every vehicle's
transponder work everywhere for all purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Experts like Lee Armstrong, a Boston-based consultant working on
the standards, say a move to the 5.9 gigahertz band will make
achieving that goal simpler, because the mutually incompatible
systems now in use in different regions of the country use other
frequencies.
</P>
<P>
   The use of intelligent transportation systems would catch on
faster if auto makers built transponders into the cars they sold,
Armstrong said, but that won't happen until a standard is
established and the automakers discern consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a chicken-and-egg thing,'' he said. ``A large number of
people won't want built-in transponders unless they see a large
number of applications. If we can get a standard developed, it
would go a long way to driving public acceptance.'' But if no
standard is agreed on soon, he warned, fast food chains and fuel
retailers will move ahead with existing technology and chances for
a national system will recede.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Johnson, who directs the Transportation Department
office responsible for intelligent transportation systems, said the
government would back a national 5.9-gigahertz technical standard,
though it would also continue to develop standards for
commercial-vehicle transponders using older technology. ``The 5.9
gigahertz approach,'' Johnson said, ``allows for additional
applications, and there is some overlap with Japan and Europe, so
it puts us closer to a global market than just a North American
market.''
</P>
<P>
   With the high expectations pinned on ITS systems and the onrush
of new technology, the government is on ``a tough road,'' Johnson
said. ``In other arenas we've been quite successful in convening
the industry and catalyzing them to a consensus,'' she added. ``We
can try to foster an industry standard, but we can't force it.''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of issues remain to be worked out, including whether
existing toll plaza equipment can be adapted to a new standard or
must be replaced and whether the industry can deliver a workable
system as fast as many proponents hope.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial fleet owners like trucking companies are among those
most impatient for a nationally interoperable system. Cross-country
truckers now have to carry multiple transponders for incompatible
systems at toll lanes, weigh stations and truck stops.
Standardizing on a single system could speed freight movement
across the country and, if used at border crossings, to and from
Mexico and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Keppler, commercial vehicle manager for ITS America, said
that equipment to perform these tasks was all feasible, but might
be significantly more expensive than today's generation of
transponders. So one more question is on the table: Who will pay
for the new system, users or taxpayers?

WHEN 2 GREAT LEGAL MINDS DO BATTLE AT THE NEXT LEVEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: also moved in ``e'' category) 
(bl) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Richard A. Posner published his book last
September analyzing the investigation, impeachment and trial of
President Clinton, it was not treated as just another commentator's
view of the affair. Not only is Posner a sitting judge, the chief
judge on the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, based in Chicago.
He is also, to a wide swath of intellectuals, one of the most
fascinating contemporary thinkers on the law as well as on an
astonishingly broad range of subjects. Moreover, his book, ``An
Affair of State'' (Harvard University Press), did not shrink from
blunt assertions and conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Posner charged that Clinton was indisputably guilty of perjury
and a man of shallow character and that many of his defenders in
the intellectual and academic community were blithering fools or
hypocrites or both.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Ronald Dworkin, professor of law at New York
University and the University Professor of Jurisprudence at Oxford
University, to say that the Posner book is an abomination. In the
forthcoming issue of The New York Review of Books, Dworkin writes
that the Posner book is silly, dangerous, anti-intellectual and
empty. Until now, the book has been treated with great respect and
provided enormous comfort to those repelled by the president's
actions but queasy about associating themselves with longtime
Clinton-haters. But to Dworkin, it is a partisan screed
masquerading as scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Dworkin, who is similarly revered by many scholars
as one of the greatest contemporary legal thinkers, opens a second
front of criticism when he contends that it was inappropriate and
may well have been unethical of Posner, as a sitting judge, to pass
judgment _ actually declare Clinton guilty _ in a matter that has
the potential to became a federal criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   Posner, who was shown the Dworkin piece this week, reacted with
barely muted indignation at the notion that he had behaved
unethicallly. In a four-page letter to a New York Times reporter
and in an interview, he defended himself and tossed a few charges
of his own at Dworkin.
</P>
<P>
   In short, this is an intense and _ at least to the many who
follow such things _ an exquisitely rich and intellectual feud
between two of the nation's most admired public intellectuals and
legal scholars. The disagreement carries within it not just the
possibility of delectable entertainment but also of enlightenment
as both men are renowned exponents of different law-based
philosophies. Posner is a leading figure of the University of
Chicago-based law and economics school that holds that many legal
and moral issues would best be resolved through rational economic
analysis. Dworkin is often thought of as a theorist who would like
the law to reflect moral analysis. Each method can sometimes be
best summarized by their critics; the Posner approach is sometimes
derided as coldhearted, the Dworkin way as softheaded. In any case,
The New York Times Book Review included it in its list of the 11
best books of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Dworkin opens the ethical battle with his assertion that
Posner's ``ethics in publishing a book about Clinton's impeachment
so soon after the event are open to question, because judges are
not meant to enter political controversies.''
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate his contention that Posner traveled ``well beyond
anything that could be regarded as neutral scholarship,'' Dworkin
cites a passage in the book that asserts that Clinton, ``committed
repeated and varied felonious obstructions of justice over a period
of almost a year which he garnished with gaudy public and private
lies, vicious slanders, tactical blunders, gross errors of
judgment, hypocritical displays of contrition, affronts to
conventional morality and parental authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Dworkin writes that it is ``injudicious, to put it mildly, for a
judge to make such a public parade of his own politics.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Posner said of the portion of his book quoted by
Dworkin: ``I don't think it's partisan, I think it's undeniable.
But that's a matter of opinion.'' He said he was deeply concerned
about ``being accused of a breach of judicial ethics,'' adding,
``This is the kind of thing for which one could be reprimanded.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not any violation, he said, because there was and
continues to be no pending case involving Clinton. ``A prosecution
of President Clinton while conceivable as a theoretical possibility
is not imminent and in fact almost certainly is not going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He then went on to return fire on the ethics front. It was
unethical, he said, for Dworkin to have agreed to review a book by
a scholar with whom he had jousted fiercely over the years, and for
that matter for The New York Review to have assigned it to him.
Dworkin's criticism was in a review of the Posner impeachment book
and a second Posner book about legal theory. ``Reputable magazines
do not give books to the author's enemies to review,'' Posner wrote
in his letter, ``and, if scrupulous, a person asked to review an
enemy's books turns it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Dworkin said that he and the Review had scrupulously disclosed
in the piece that he had been a frequent object of Posner's
criticism. ``Even still, I do not consider us `enemies,''' Dworkin
said.
</P>
<P>
   All of which raises the question of whether a political and
scholarly rivalry must become personal. Each man, in interviews and
in writing, offers gracious comments about the other in the midst
of the corrosive charges.
</P>
<P>
   Dworkin calls Posner ``the wonder of the legal world'' and
writes that the volume of his scholarship is amazing. The
impeachment book, he said, has many virtues, among them being
``clear, brisk and often amusing.''
</P>
<P>
   He has invited Posner to his seminars at New York University
several times, he noted. Posner, for his part, said that Dworkin
had a ``supple intellect'' and had always been pleasant and
civilized in their disagreements. In The Harvard Law Review, Posner
once called Dworkin one of the ``leading scholars of jurisprudence
in the English-speaking world.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet this latest battle may have taken the disagreement over some
sort of line. ``I think Dworkin is a mild-mannered person who goes
overboard when he has a pen in his hand,'' Posner said. Speaking of
the judicial ethics issue, he said, ``I don't think I have ever
done anything publicly that calls into question his character.''

 WASHINGTON: those agreements.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A top executive at the business group, Mike Baroodui, said:
``Gore's comments made a tough job even tougher. We were worried
that people who were looking for a plausible way out or even to
delay the vote could draw some aide and comfort from Gore's
comments. The letter removes that worry.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen how actively the vice president will push
the accord, because he cannot afford to alienate organized labor.
But the lobby was thrilled that the letter put him on the record as
clearly supporting the Clinton agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore insists that he would revisit China's adherence to
labor and environmental standards, as a practical matter he will
have little leverage. After China is a member of the WTO,
Washington will have lost its main negotiating leverage over
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   And after China is a member, it will join the other developing
nations that argue that ``labor rights'' and ``environmental
standards'' are simply code words for a Western conspiracy to force
them to pay higher wages and spend billions of dollars on
environmental measures.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments about whether the WTO should even examine the links
among labor standards, the environment and trade sped the collapse
of the trade talks in Seattle in December. Administration officials
now concede that that meeting was among their biggest blunders of
Clinton's second term. Gore, sensing the clash, carefully skipped
the event.
</P>
<P>
   But the AFL-CIO, among other groups, was greatly emboldened by
the Seattle demonstrations, where the protests led by union members
``shifted the debate about globalization,'' John Sweeney, the
president of the union federation, said this week in New Orleans.
``Coming off of Seattle, we are at a historic turning point.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinking the China deal is clearly the next objective, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Sweeney disagreed with those who believe that Gore
had said anything to the unions that undercut Clinton or the trade
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president has been consistent,'' Sweeney said. ``His
letter reiterates the position he took at the AFL-CIO convention in
Los Angeles in October. When the vice president addressed the
Executive Council on Thursday, he took pains to tell the council
that he supported the president on the deal with China.''
</P>
<P>
   In October, even before the China deal had been signed, Gore had
called for enforceable labor protections in trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders are focusing on members of Congress in pivotal
districts, an effort that makes many Democrats wary of signing up
with the White House. And for the first time, the unions are trying
to create alliances of convenience with conservative Republicans
who oppose the China deal on the grounds of national security.
</P>
<P>
   The unions are clearly overjoyed by Gore's vacillation. No one
expected him to break publicly from the White House, and in fact he
has repeatedly said he favors China's admission to the WTO. But his
willingness to talk about the need for a tougher deal sends a
signal that this one is flawed.
</P>
<P>
   The White House disagrees. ``This is an agreement that helps
American workers here and that ultimately lifts the standards of
workers in China over time,'' Sandy Berger, the national security
adviser, said in a recent interview. By gradually enveloping China
in a system largely run by Western standards, Berger argued, China
will see the benefits of changing its ways. In any case, he added,
``this agreement can't be renegotiated.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the unions hope that it can be. The president of the
United Steel Workers, George Becker, who has been pressing Gore for
two years to stop low-cost steel imports, said this week his union
would do its best to sink the efforts to win approval of the trade
deal. Then, he said, ``We're going to give the Gore administration
an opportunity to deal with it.''

A PITCHER BATTLES BACK

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ This wouldn't be the first time somebody
didn't realize what they had in Julio Santana.
</P>
<P>
   He was a 15-year-old in Ingenio Consuelo, a small village
outside of San Pedro de Macoris in the Dominican Republic, when a
Texas Rangers scout came to town to try out one of Santana's
buddies, a shortstop. Santana said he and some other friends
watched for a while, then headed into the sugar-cane fields to chew
on some fresh cane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went back alone,'' he said Friday, ``and I got a glove and
caught my friend's throws. Then the scout, Quki Acevedo, said to
me, `Hey, you go hit.' I didn't have my spikes or anything. But I
showed some power, and Quki said, `What's your name?' ''
</P>
<P>
   And so it went. Acevedo hit Santana some ground balls at third,
then at short, and was dazzled by the strength of his arm. Soon,
the scout forgot all about the other kid. Shortly after he turned
16, Santana said, a caravan of Texas scouts pulled up to his house
and signed him on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was signed in a strange, strange way,'' Santana said.
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade has passed since then. The Rangers tried
Santana first as a shortstop, then in the outfield, but when he
didn't hit, they decided to make him a pitcher. He resisted the
idea at first. His brother, Ernesto, who used to play catch with
Tim Wakefield when they were both in the Pirates' system, never
made it as a pitcher, even though he threw hard, too.
</P>
<P>
   But Santana made it to the big leagues as a pitcher, and now,
after three mostly disappointing seasons with the Rangers and Tampa
Bay Devil Rays, he's trying to hang on with the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox picked up Santana in a waiver deal July 21 for an
obscure lefthander named Fred Silverthorn. Pedro Martinez had just
gotten hurt, Tomo Ohka had gotten lit up in his big-league debut,
and the Sox were looking for a pitcher. ``They wanted me to start
in Detroit,'' Santana said.
</P>
<P>
   But he had some bad news for general manager Dan Duquette. He
had tendinitis in his right shoulder, which had contributed to him
losing a spot in the starting rotation for the Devil Rays. The Sox
took no chances. They put Santana on the disabled list and left him
in Florida to rest and rehab for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   During the winter, Santana was released, but last month signed a
minor league deal with an invitation to big-league camp. Still only
26, Santana said he can throw again in the mid-90s, the way he did
before he was hurt. The Rangers and Devil Rays gave up on him, but
Santana insists the Sox aren't making a mistake by giving him a
look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come here only with the idea of pitching in the major
leagues,'' he said. ``I've pitched well against Boston. I think I
was meant to be with the Boston Red Sox.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides being a fellow Dominican, he has this in common with
Martinez: Ken Griffey has never gotten a hit off him. Junior is 0
for 9 against Santana, 0 for 12 against Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a real strong arm,'' said pitching coach Joe
Kerrigan. ``When he pitched against us, he threw 93 to 96 (miles
per hour). He has a hard slider, and after watching him throw a
couple of side sessions, he showed me a good changeup, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``But before you can even consider whether he's in the mix, we
have to see how his arm holds up in the next couple of weeks. Let's
see how the shoulder feels when he gets back in the regular routine
of pitching. That's our No. 1 priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Santana, whose uncle, Rico Carty, once starred for the Braves
and later ran for mayor of San Pedro de Macoris, worked out all
winter with Martinez's personal trainer. Listed as 6 feet, 225
pounds, he cuts an impressive figure. ``He's got a back like
Charles Barkley,'' Kerrigan said.
</P>
<P>
   But last spring, after predicting he could become the ace of the
Devil Rays' staff, Santana was just 1-4 with a 7.32 ERA. He gave up
66 hits in 55 1/3 innings and walked far too many batters (32) and
gave up far too many home runs (10).
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have a lot to learn,'' Santana said. ``But Pedro told
me that even when he came here, a Cy Young winner, he learned a lot
from the veterans like (Bret) Saberhagen.
</P>
<P>

   Saturday is the official reporting date for Sox pitchers, with
the first workout scheduled for Sunday. Will the Martinez brothers
be here? ``When they get here they get here,'' Kerrigan said. ``You
don't worry about those guys. They've got their own pitching coach
down there, their own personal trainer.'' . . . Kerrigan didn't
sound quite as sure about Rod Beck. He said the reliever is the
only pitcher on the staff he has been unable to contact. ``I've
left him a few messages,'' he said. ``You call his number and you
get Rod Beck Auto Supplies or Rod Beck Truck and RV Rental. I don't
know what the story is.'' . . . Kerrigan played catch for the first
time Friday with Saberhagen. ``You watch him long toss,'' he said,
``and you'd never know he just had shoulder surgery.'' . . . Bryce
Florie was among Friday's arrivals . . . A full contingent of
catchers is here _ Scott Hatteberg, Steve Lomasney, ex-Royal Tim
Spehr, and career minor leaguer Joe Siddall, who has played briefly
in the big leagues with the Expos, Marlins, and Tigers . . . Jimy
Williams was expected in town Friday night.

CONSERVATIVE ATTACKS ON MCCAIN PUZZLE HIS SUPPORTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On conservative talk radio, Rush Limbaugh has
painted Sen. John McCain of Arizona as a guy who would fit right in
with the ``pro-abortion, pro-affirmative action'' Clinton-Gore
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   And the banner headline in the conservative Human Events this
week is ``High-Tax John McCain.'' The accompanying article tells
how McCain once considered voting against a proposed tax cut _
though he did not actually do so _ because he ``objected to several
minor corporate tax exemptions in the bill, including one that went
to businesses that transformed chicken waste into energy.'' Inside
the publication: ``Why Liberals Love McCain'' and ``Media Man
McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Many far less conservative publications have also tended to
regard the senator as a moderate _ to the point that when Gary
Bauer, the purist former head of the Family Research Council,
endorsed him this week, the announcement came as a surprise to a
lot of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's 17-year record in Congress, though, markedly undercuts
the message from the camp of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas that the
senator is insufficiently right-leaning.
</P>
<P>
   McCain supports school vouchers, missile defense, the death
penalty and a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning. He has
opposed affirmative action and most gun control legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the governor, he does not support federal financing of
the arts. He voted to convict President Clinton in the impeachment
trial, he is strongly pro-military, he defended Ronald Reagan
during the Iran-contra inquiry and he has a long history as a
deregulator.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, it is true, has proposed a much heftier tax cut. But
McCain has never voted for a broad tax increase, including the one
adopted by Bush's father.
</P>
<P>
   Many conservatives unaligned with either candidate say that some
of the vitriol directed at McCain stems from his push for campaign
finance legislation, which conservative interest groups feel would
significantly curtail their clout.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, these conservatives say, has also alienated some in the
movement with remarks considered too hard on the Republican Party,
like his assertion that the party is ``in the pocket of the
insurance companies.'' He is simply too independent-minded, and his
cozy relationship with reporters makes many Republicans
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a number of these conservatives say they see no
appreciable ideological difference between McCain and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both good conservatives, and this is simply politics
as usual,'' said R. Emmett Tyrell Jr., editor of The American
Spectator.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, while conservative groups have questioned his
commitment as an opponent of abortion, McCain has proved quite a
reliable ally on the issue. The National Right to Life Committee
has given him a 100 percent approval rating in seven of his 13
years in the Senate, and his overall average of 86 percent would be
far higher if not for votes on fetal tissue research, which he
supports, and on campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about those numbers, the group's executive director, David
O'Steen, said he was more disturbed by ``signals'' that McCain had
sent during the campaign than by his Senate record.
</P>
<P>
   Other positions of McCain's that are apt to provoke some
conservatives are similar to those held by Bush. Both men
ultimately supported intervention in Kosovo, and both back Chinese
membership in the World Trade Organization. Both have disappointed
some on the right by refusing to rule out a running mate who does
not oppose abortion. And both would keep the current ``don't ask,
don't tell'' policy on gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Republicans say they find the questioning of
McCain's conservative credentials ridiculous. And his friend
William Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, sees it as further
evidence of the demise of the entire conservative movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the conservative crackup, and it's quite remarkable,''
Kristol said. ``Reasonable people can support either Bush or
McCain, but the ferocity of this assault on McCain? Historians will
look back and say, `This was the end.' I think the Christian right,
which I've defended, is finished because of what Ralph Reed and Pat
Robertson have done in South Carolina, because of the meanness of
the assault.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed, who is advising Bush, said no one in the governor's camp
had anything but respect for McCain and that they had not once
described him as liberal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never said that,'' Reed declared. ``I'm not aware of any
conservative leader calling him a liberal. They have rightly said
he's advocated policies that would be devastating to the
conservative philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   For example?
</P>
<P>
   Reed said McCain would end the tax deduction for charitable
contributions and had once voted against a ``paycheck protection''
bill, though he voted in favor of such legislation on four other
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   McCain says he does not want to end the charitable-contribution
deduction, only close what he calls a loophole that allows the
donor of stock or a painting, say, to deduct the full current
market value while paying no capital gains taxes on the property's
increase in value over the years. And he voted in that one instance
against ``paycheck protection'' _ requiring unions to get
individual members' permission before using their dues for
political purposes _ only because it was offered as a ``poison
pill'' amendment intended to defeat campaign finance legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Kristol and several other conservatives suggested that McCain's
good media relations were a public relations disaster in the
conservative world. But if there was a conservative who was somehow
able to charm the media, would that not be a good thing?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, God forbid we'd have a candidate who's good at being a
politician and isn't a sourpuss,'' Kristol said grimly. ``It's
pathological.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservative writer William J. Bennett, a former secretary
of education who has been advising both McCain and Bush, said that
for many conservatives, the real difference between the two was a
matter of perceived passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more obvious in Bush's case that he's conservative,''
Bennett said, ``because he's been passionate about conservative
themes.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, questions about McCain do not necessarily
translate into enthusiasm for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they both think they're conservative, because that's
what everyone wants to be right now, but there are problems with
both,'' said Phyllis Schlafly, founder of the anti-feminist Eagle
Forum, who supported Steve Forbes. Now that he is out of the race,
she said, ``I think I will sit this one out.''

MACY'S RESTAURANT TO CLOSE, AS A STYLE OF SHOPPING ENDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For Ronnie and Ger Petrie, tourists from Ireland, it
was a decidedly American moment: sharing a BLT at the eighth-floor
diner at Macy's in Herald Square, and chatting with the shopper
sitting next to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of life is around this counter,'' said Petrie as his
waitress scribbled out his bill.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, a tradition at the world's largest department
store will come to an end when the restaurant, which employees say
dates back more than 70 years, will close.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all tied in with a way of shopping that's gone,'' said Jack
Taylor, a New Yorker interested in the preservation of landmarks.
``They were a resource that a shopper could resort to to stay in
the same building. People could shop in the morning, have lunch and
continue shopping. And these places were not fast food.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, restaurants were fixtures in some of New York's
finest department stores. Up until B. Altman closed a decade ago,
it had a tea-style restaurant called Charleston Garden.
</P>
<P>
   But Lord &AMP; Taylor still has the American Cafe, once called the
Birdcage, and Bloomingdale's has Le Train Bleu, a 20-year-old
establishment modeled after a French dining car.
</P>
<P>
   Elina Kazan, a Macy's spokeswoman, said the diner's closing is
part of a renovation project that began three years ago. The
restaurant, which can seat almost 200 people, is not the ideal
hangout, she said, because the curved counters do not allow
shoppers to sit in groups.
</P>
<P>
   In early spring, she said, Macy's plans to open two Italian
restaurants on the basement floor, and a branch of the food chain
Au Bon Pain recently opened next to the diner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll all be upset when this closes,'' said Thanh Ngo, a
manager who has worked in the diner for two decades. ``This is the
oldest restaurant in the store. It's part of history.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The restaurant was called the Patio until around 1995, he said,
when Macy's remodeled it with a diner-style design. Ngo pointed to
different corners of the room and smiled nostalgically: Here was a
pastrami cutting board, there hung glittering chandeliers.
</P>
<P>
   The diner is the latest of about a half-dozen restaurants that
Macy's has shut down in recent years, Ngo said. The others,
scattered over several floors, served fare ranging from California
cuisine to ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the diner employees will move to different departments
in the store. Robert Willis, for instance, a cook who has worked in
the restaurant for almost 30 years, said he will be stocking
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're getting rid of something special,'' he said.
``I've never had a better time.''

SEEKING A NEW BOUNCE AT PEPSI  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gary M. Rodkin, the chief executive of Pepsi-Cola North America,
has not just one all-time favorite film, but four.
</P>
<P>
   There's ``The Godfather,'' and ``The Godfather, Part II.'' And
``The Deer Hunter,'' starring Robert De Niro. And then, lest anyone
conclude that there is some grim new face at the helm of the
country's No. 2 soft-drink company, there is also ``Animal House,''
which Rodkin admits to having seen at least 20 times and knowing
pretty much by heart.
</P>
<P>
   He even keeps a mechanical bear next to his phone that, at the
press of a switch, bursts into ``Shout,'' the Isley Brothers song
that figured prominently in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turn it on whenever I have a tough day,'' said Rodkin, who
at age 47 has so far refrained from leaping around his office when
the music is playing.
</P>
<P>
   He was named to his job back in September, after his
predecessor, Philip A. Marineau, surprised the beverage world, not
to mention PepsiCo's chairman, Roger A. Enrico, by resigning to
join Levi Strauss. But Rodkin has not had the tough days that his
counterparts at, say, Coca-Cola have been through lately.
</P>
<P>
   Rodkin's biggest complaint may be that his company gets no
attention, given the focus on the layoffs, restructuring and
financial woes at Coke. After shedding its restaurant business and
bottling operations, Pepsi is on track to reliably increasing
earnings, many analysts say, particularly because the majority of
those earnings are generated by Frito-Lay, the snack-food behemoth.
Nevertheless, Pepsi's share price has largely risen and fallen with
Coke's.
</P>
<P>
   Rodkin left his longtime position as head of Tropicana, the
juice giant that PepsiCo acquired from Seagram in 1998, to run
Pepsi-Cola. The transition from orange and grapefruit juice, a
business with commodity prices at the forefront and issues of
transportation and refrigeration close behind, has not been that
difficult, he says.
</P>
<P>
   While Tropicana kept the whole business under one roof, the
company that produces Pepsi concentrate is now separate from the
bottlers. ``It's an excellent relationship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a concentrate company _ the bottling spinoff was 11 months
ago _ Pepsi has a mission, Rodkin said, to provide the marketing
might that will sell more soft drinks, building up volume so that
bottlers like the Pepsi Bottling Group and the Whitman Corp., the
two largest, will see their fortunes change.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, share prices of both bottlers are near the bottom
of their 52-week range. ``We both need to win,'' he said. ``You've
got to have long-term, sustainable volume growth to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street is watching anxiously to see whether the
relationship will provide meaningful income at Pepsi. ``For the
last three years, Pepsi-Cola has disappointed, and the key thing
for investors is getting confident that Pepsi can deliver the
profit growth,'' said Bill Pecoriello, a beverage analyst for
Sanford C. Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   Among Rodkin's challenges are reinvigorating Pepsi One, the
heavily marketed one-calorie cola that Pepsi put on the market in
1998, and getting more growth out of Pepsi-Cola, which, like Coke,
has seen sales flatten in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   He plans a campaign for the flagship brand this summer that will
encourage people to create custom CDs, using music downloaded from
a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect that, having run Tropicana, he will try to
expand Pepsi's noncarbonated line, perhaps with what the trade
calls ``functional'' beverages, like drinks with added calcium.
</P>
<P>
   Within Pepsi, Rodkin has quickly made his mark as a listener.
Except on a couple of subjects. ``I've learned never to challenge
him on music or sports trivia,'' said Dawn Hudson, Pepsi's senior
vice president for strategy and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The music is an earned credit. Rodkin, who once played guitar in
a band called Lynx, was among the earliest fans of Bruce
Springsteen, back when the Boss played cramped auditoriums in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   As for sports, Rodkin grew up in Piscataway _ the home of a big
Pepsi bottling plant, he notes these days _ swinging a baseball bat
with his friends after school and generally enjoying an
all-American childhood. He tells of once seeing Mickey Mantle hit
three home runs in a game at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The deal to name Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg was his
doing; he won't disclose the price, but he says it was roughly what
other ballpark deals have cost.
</P>
<P>
   His own children, a 14-year-old son and an 11-year-old daughter,
still live outside Sarasota, Fla., where Rodkin and his wife,
Barbara, have their home. The family is planning to move closer to
Pepsi's headquarters in Purchase, N.Y. ``I do like to make sure
there is balance,'' he said. ``I crave spending time with my wife
and kids, and I want to get that balance in our employees' lives. I
don't think there's quite enough.''

A GIDDY MCCAIN URGES SOUTH CAROLINIANS TO TURN OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HILTON HEAD, S.C. _ He swore he had no butterflies, no jitters,
no day-before-the-vote anxieties.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain, the insurgent Republican trying to upend the party
establishment, was giddy Friday as he urged people to go to the
polls and vote Saturday. On his bus, as the stereo blared ``When
Johnny Comes Marching Home,'' he performed a mock march, knees
high, while holding a cup of coffee in the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very optimistic, I'm very upbeat,'' he insisted, when
asked if he felt nervous. What if it rains, he was asked. ``They
say it's going to be clear,'' he maintained.
</P>
<P>
   What if he loses, he was asked. ``No matter what, we go on to
California, we go on to March 7,'' he said, calling himself a bit
of a fatalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do everything you can,'' he said. ``You do the best you
can.''
</P>
<P>
   And then that's it.
</P>
<P>
   In the packed ballroom of the Sun City retirement community,
McCain was exuberant as he urged seniors to vote and predicted a
win like his one in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Democrats, Republicans, independents, libertarians,
vegetarians, Trotskyites,'' he cracked. ``If they support our
cause, we want them out to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   A Dixieland band greeted McCain, playing ``Yessir, that's my
baby,'' before a crowd of about 500 people. The Arizona senator
railed against the special interests with their big money trying to
influence government, about the campaign finance scandals of the
Clinton-Gore administration and about military families who need
food stamps to make do.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're scared to death and I love it!'' McCain exulted, as he
condemned the ``iron triangle'' of special interests that oppose
his campaign finance proposals.
</P>
<P>
   At the College of Charleston, an even larger, enthusiastic crowd
of several thousand students overflowed the gymnasium. Just a few
days ago, Bush held an event in the same space, with far fewer
people, and far less intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the Palmetto state, McCain has faced a barrage of
television commercials, phone calls, e-mails and leaflets against
him. And many of those are the result of outside groups, not just
Texas Governor George W. Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry Governor Bush has orchestrated his campaign so it's
nothing but negative ads,'' McCain told the crowd in Hilton Head.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when asked whether he feels he is owed an apology, McCain
said any apology shouldn't be directed to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't be an apology, it would be an apology to the
people of South Carolina for running such a low campaign,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever happens Saturday, McCain said, he believes that his
candidacy has changed the political landscape for the Republican
Party, bringing in new people who haven't voted in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw the banner `Reformer With Results,' I knew we
changed the political landscape,'' he said of Bush's message
overhaul, which mimics McCain's rhetoric. ``He's taking credit for
a patients bill of rights, for a bill that he vetoed.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Bush supporters have criticized McCain for being
more attractive to Democratic and independent voters, who are
eligible to vote in the Republican primary, than to Republicans.
McCain, however, has embraced the criticism, saying he's practicing
the politics of inclusion the way Ronald Reagan did, and trying to
expand the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times flies when you're having fun, right?'' said McCain, as
his bus pulled into the retirement community.
</P>
<P>
   Later, McCain and his entourage traveled up the seacoast, first
to a big indoor rally in Litchfield Beach and then to meet a
boisterous crowd at the NASCAR Cafe in Myrtle Beach. McCain asked
his supporters to come out in large numbers and he seemed
exhilarated by the contest that pollsters said was too close to
call.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a guy that finished fifth from the bottom in his class at
the Naval Academy this is a pretty wild ride,'' McCain said at the
Litchfield Beach and Golf Resort.
</P>
<P>
   McCain predicted victory and said, ``Once we win, they're never
ever going to be able to stop us.''

BUSH PREDICTS A VICTORY   IN SATURDAY'S PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLINTON, S.C. _ Insisting that the prospect of a massive turnout
Saturday in South Carolina primary was ``good news,'' Texas
Governor George W. Bush predicted Friday that he would not only
triumph over Arizona Senator John McCain, but also carry the
veterans vote in this military-oriented state.
</P>
<P>
   As the competition in one of the most critical primaries in
recent history came to a close, there was speculation that a heavy
influx of independents and Democrats could skew the results.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina has no party registration. As a result, all
voters are eligible to take a Republican ballot. Polls indicate
Bush is leading comfortably among Republicans, but trailing among
independents and Democrats who intend to support McCain.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush said he welcomed the new faces in the GOP primary, he
suggested that some Democrats might take part ``to send a message
to George W. and then go back to Al Gore in the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a press conference here, the Texas governor said,
``There's nothing I can do about that but rally my base.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Bush campaign, there is concern over the possibility
that a rush to McCain by independent voters, a phenomenon that
occurred in the New Hampshire primary, would swamp Bush's
Republican constituency.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's advisers said they thought the Arizona senator will win
if the vote tops 400,000. Only 276,000 voted in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's that simple,'' said Karl Rove, Bush's chief
strategist. ``There are a lot of independent conservatives out
there, and that augurs well for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has been fully mobilized in South Carolina
since his astonishing 19-point defeat to McCain in New Hampshire.
The well-financed Bush operation has thrown millions of dollars
into the state, buying up TV time and reinforcing his organization
on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has the support of much of the Republican Party apparatus
in South Carolina, including former Governor Carroll Campbell, who
was a kingmaker for Bush's father in a pivotal primary here in
1988. Campbell traveled with the younger Bush Friday, along with
Lieutenant Governor Bob Peeler, Attorney General Charles Condon,
and House Speaker David Wilkins. Senator Strom Thurmond, a
political fixture in the state for more than a half-century, has
also endorsed Bush, as has former Governor David Beasley.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally at Presbyterian College, Bush told a crowd filling
the school gymnasium: ``If South Carolina votes for George Bush, it
will be the beginning of the end of the Clinton era in Washington,
D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite evidence of widespread support for McCain among veterans
groups in a state rich with military bases and retired veterans,
Bush also vowed, ``I'm going to carry the veterans vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he said he based his comment on a ``gut feeling _
we'll find out.''
</P>
<P>
   Told that that a count of absentee ballots indicated a record
turnout, Bush said: ``That's good news. I think it's heavy in
Republican precincts, and that's good news.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bush and McCain barnstormed desperately across South
Carolina, from Charleston on the seacoast to Greenville in the
foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, the state seemed captivated
by the heavyweight Republican contest. The political campaign has
usurped headlines from a burning local controversy over the
Confederate battle flag and filled local television with a blizzard
of commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Interest is high because both sides said the victor in South
Carolina will get great momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he emerged from New Hampshire with a heightened
desire. Of his combative campaign in South Carolina, Bush said:
``I've got a feisty side to me, and I wanted people to see it.''

<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Geoffrey Bodine's presence in a hospital
here Friday, lucky to have only several broken bones, serves as the
latest and perhaps most compelling reason the Daytona 500 plans to
continue its restrictions on speed.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, a day after Bodine failed to qualify for Sunday's
Daytona 500, the 50-year-old from upstate New York somehow survived
a harrowing, fireball crash at Daytona that injured 10 drivers and
9 spectators and sheered 50 yards of fencing from its foundation.
It was the worst multivehicle accident at Daytona since 1987, when
Donnie Allison's horrific wreck prompted Daytona officials to back
off the throttle.
</P>
<P>
   That led to the introduction of restrictor plate racing, which
keeps the cars from approaching the 200 mile-an-hour level they
might otherwise approach. Today that format is used only at Daytona
and Talladega in Alabama among 34 Winston Cup Series events.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Craftsman Truck Series' debut Friday at Daytona, Mike
Helton, NASCAR's chief operating officer, expressed reservations
about allowing full horsepower racing. What he saw had to make him
wish he had been more assertive about restrictions, even though
team owners in all levels of racing want them abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the tri-oval on the 57th lap in a 100-lap race, the
rookie Kurt Busch dropped his No. 99 Ford low, nipping Rob Morgan's
Ford in the process. That set in motion a chain of events that
involved 13 trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan was knocked sideways, skidding into Bodine's Ford and
sandwiching him into the course's protective fencing. The impact
sheered the fencing from its foundation and sent flames and debris
shooting in all directions. Bodine's truck, by this time folded in
half with the engine flying toward the infield, rolled wildly along
the railing for about 50 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The horror was not over. Along came Jimmy Kitchens in car No. 42
and blasted Bodine from behind, exploding his fuel cell and
knocking his truck like a ragdoll up the track. When he stopped
bouncing, all that was left of his truck was a mangled cage, with
sheet metal strung all over the track.
</P>
<P>
   Close-up photography showed that Bodine's left arm dangled out
of the truck's shell at one point as he tumbled over. Workers took
at least 10 minutes to pry him out of the cage and sent him to
Halifax Medical Center, where he was listed in serious condition.
He has a facial laceration, a broken right wrist, a small vertebrae
fracture and burns on his arms, injuries that reportedly are not
considered serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had a wreck like that in my life,'' Bodine, an
18-time Winston Cup series winner, said from the hospital. ``I was
fully aware of the trouble down on the inside of me. I saw that
they were coming up into me, and then I just went on a wild ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodine's younger brother, Todd, also a NASCAR driver, was among
a group of relatives who went to the hospital to be near Bodine,
who is from Chemung, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing about a crash, especially one as violent as
that, is you worry about head injuries,'' Todd Bodine said. ``He's
going to be fine. He's conscious and alert, talking to the doctors.
We can take some broken bones. That stuff can heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, Todd Bodine reluctantly participated in a
practice Busch Series race.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see something as violent as that as a race driver,
you get concerned and worry and it gets to you a little bit,'' he
said. ``Then to have it be a family member, it really works on you.
But I've got a job to do. I've just got to put it out of my mind
and go race.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the nine injured spectators were treated and released,
four at the infield care center and the rest at Halifax. Of those
who were kept overnight, one was being treated for a fractured left
arm and the other for a facial laceration and possible fractured
sinus.
</P>
<P>
   Kitchens, in a Chevrolet, was the only other driver to be taken
to the hospital. It was only as a precaution, a track official
said.
</P>
<P>
   From the stands, the wreck unfolded so fast that it caught many
off guard. Craig Stephenson, from Harrisburg, Pa., was sitting
nearby with his wife when suddenly all he could see was ``a ball of
fire and smoke all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Stephenson said he saw a woman running from the stands
``with blood running from her face.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Lowe of Mechanicsburg, Pa., said the carnage could have
been a lot worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fence did its job,'' he said. ``It threw the trucks back
onto the track.''
</P>
<P>
   Repairs were made and the race was held up for 2 hours 23
minutes before Mike Wallace eventually won. Wallace said he would
like to see the trucks return here and didn't think Friday's crash
would permanently detract from the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``An anxious young rookie helped activate that wreck,'' he said.
``He did a stupid thing, and thank God nobody got hurt seriously.
But one mistake shouldn't wipe you out.''
</P>
<P>
   It almost did for Bodine on Friday.  &QL;

IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL IS CHARGED AS SPY FOR CUBAN GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to expand, rewrite throughout)  
(HLW) 
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A high-ranking U.S. immigration official was charged in
federal court on Friday with spying for the Cuban government, after
federal officials say he was caught in an elaborate sting passing
on classified information about a Cuban's plan to defect to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Mariano M. Faget, (pronounced fah-hay) who was born in
Havana and fled Cuba in his teens, is a senior official in the
Miami field office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Faget, who is 54, was arrested here late Thursday. The immigration
service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation say they caught him
last week passing along to an otherwise unidentified ``Cuban-born
New York businessman'' false information they had fed him about a
Cuban intelligence agent's plan to defect to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Faget was charged with violations of the Espionage Act and lying
to federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   Private individuals have been convicted of spying for Cuba, but
federal officials said they knew of no prior instance of an arrest
of American government official.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here for 24 years,'' said Terry Nelson, an FBI
spokesman, ``and I can't recall ever arresting a government
official _ especially an official with such access to immigrant
records.''
</P>
<P>
   As section chief for adjudications and the third-ranking officer
in the Miami office, Faget had access to classified files and the
authority to treat applications for political asylum. Thus he was
in a position to tell Havana of the plans of Cuban nationals to
defect and subject them to retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is continuing and officials said they did not
know of defections Faget might have blocked. ``It's too early to
tell if he did any damage, or what kind of damage he did,'' said
Carlos Zaldivar, a lawyer in the Miami office of the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Faget, who was scheduled to retire in March, made a telephone
call, recorded by the FBI, on Feb. 14 to the New York businessman,
then visiting Beijing. In the call, Faget said he had nothing new
to report about the Cuban spy.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit filed with the charges against Faget, Joe
Franklin, a special agent for the FBI in Miami, wrote: ``The
businessman concluded the call by asking Faget, `You're still not
leaving until next month, right?' Faget answered, `Until next
month. Yes. We have time.'''
</P>
<P>
   The arrest is likely to stir the pot of Cuban-American
relations, already boiling because of the custody battle over
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, who survived his mother's drowning when
she fled Cuba with him in November. Elian's relatives here are
fighting in court for custody against the wishes of his father in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I found out about this, I laughed,'' said Jose Basulto,
president of Brothers to the Rescue, a Cuban exile group that
supports the relatives. ``I'm sure there are many more spies out
there, hundreds, even thousands. This should really come in handy
for Elian's situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The cases are unrelated and investigation of Faget began more
than a year ago, the officials said. Maria Cardona, a spokeswoman
for the immigration service, said Faget ``has never been involved
in the Elian Gonzalez case.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference here and in a court affidavit, immigration
and FBI officials and U.S. Attorney Thomas E. Scott described a
year of investigating Faget after suspicions were raised by a
routine investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, investigators say, they observed Faget meeting with a
Cuban intelligence officer for 90 minutes at Pitchers Bar at the
Miami Marriott Hotel and with a second officer for two hours in a
secluded area of the lobby of the Hilton Hotel in Miami. Faget
never disclosed the meetings to his superiors, the investigators
reported. He also was not authorized to meet the agents on
immigration service business, but the government did not report
whether the men discussed immigration matters.
</P>
<P>
   If found guilty on all the charges, he faces at least 10 years
in prison and a $250,000 fine. Faget, who is being held in the
Federal Detention Center here, could not be reached for comment,
and no one answered the phone at his home. A woman at the office of
his lawyer, Joel Kaplan, said Kaplan was unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Faget spent 34 years with the immigration service, climbing the
ranks from an entry level clerical job. In 1971, official records
show, he married Pitty Sanchez, who is also called Maria and is 52.
To all appearances, they live modestly in a white, two-story tract
house in the Amaretto subdivision in Kendall, southwest of Miami.
They bought the house in July 1998 for $134,000 and took a mortgage
of $107,000.
</P>
<P>
   Late on Friday, a green Hyundai sedan was parked in the
driveway, and The Miami Herald had not been retrieved from the
lawn. Children skating in the cul-de-sac said they often saw a man
and woman coming and going but that the couple exchanged no more
than the occasional greeting.

DILIGENCE PAYING OFF FOR CASNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until he turned 31, Bill Casner [ had]spent most of his life
hoping he could train that one big horse at the racetrack. No luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was training for owners who didn't have the means to buy
much more than cheap horses that ran in claiming races,'' Casner
said. ``It was frustrating, because I got a chance to watch great
horses like Dr. Fager, Buckpasser and Secretariat race in person. I
was like a hungry kid looking into the candy store.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, 20 years later, the Southlake resident has broken into the
sweets, even if he bit into a few sour pieces along the way.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving horse racing in the early 1980s, Casner struggled
getting started as a businessman. He chopped cedar and sold it as
firewood and fence posts. He sold tools from the back of a truck.
He invested in oil when the boom was ready to bust.
</P>
<P>
   After all that, he invested in a small long-distance telephone
company, Excel Communications, and helped market it as it grew from
a start-up regional operator to a global firm that exceeded $1
billion in annual revenue in 1996. Life changed for Casner.
</P>
<P>
   He's back in horse racing, but, instead of relying on others to
buy cheap horses for him to train, Casner is doing the buying. And
those horses are anything but cheap. One of them, in fact, has an
outside shot at running in the Kentucky Derby this year.
</P>
<P>
   Along with partners Kenny Troutt and Bill Wittmann of Dallas,
Casner owns Elite Mercedes, a colt scheduled to make his 3-year-old
debut in the $200,000 Fountain of Youth Stakes today at Gulfstream
Park near Miami in a race televised live at 4 p.m. on ESPN. Elite
Mercedes was listed at 30-to-1 in the opening odds of the Kentucky
Derby Future Wager offered by Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   But his partnership in Elite Mercedes is a very small part of
what Casner has been doing since 1998, when he went in on his first
notable horse purchase. Late last year, Casner and Troutt purchased
18 horses for $9.3 million at the Keeneland November Sale in
Lexington, Ky. Casner and Troutt spent another $2.75 million at
Keeneland's January Sale. That included $1.8 million for Countess
Diana, who is a broodmare prospect and won the 1997 Breeders' Cup
Juvenile Fillies.
</P>
<P>
   Casner and Troutt made another high-profile purchase when they
acquired Prestonwood Farm, one of the best-known
thoroughbred-breeding facilities in the Blue Grass region near
Lexington, Ky. The deal included interests in a handful of
stallions, most notably Kris S. and Victory Gallop.
</P>
<P>
   Kris S. is the only stallion to produce four winners of
Breeders' Cup championship races, and his annual breeding revenue
is more than $4 million. Victory Gallop won the 1998 Belmont Stakes
and begins his stud career this year.
</P>
<P>
   It obviously takes money to play at this level. But the
horse-racing world was comfortable letting Casner into its league.
His background greased the skids.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a partner, I never had to explain anything to him,'' said
Art Preston, who joined Casner in some horse ownership partnerships
before he and his brothers sold Prestonwood to Casner and Troutt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very experienced horseman,'' Preston said. ``He
understands the business. This deal sort of clicked.''
</P>
<P>
   Casner grew up in El Paso. By the time he was 15, he was
breaking young horses for trainers who would take them to the
racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   And when he was old enough, that's where Casner headed. For 16
years, he worked at tracks in Arkansas, Illinois and Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hard worker. He was always looking for something to do,''
said Bob Pollock, a racing official from Nebraska and now general
manager at Retama Park near San Antonio. ``He'd gallop horses. He'd
work the \Rstarting\S gate. A handy guy, and that's probably the
reason why he's gotten to where he is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Casner and his wife, Susan, wanted to have a family. And it was
tough to settle down when they were moving from track to track. So
Casner got other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I had ever done to make a living was to make it off a
horse,'' Casner said. ``I wanted to see if I could make it in the
business world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was apprehensive about it. But I found out that the business
world was a piece of cake compared to training racehorses. The
racetrack was 100 hours plus a week. You never had a day to sleep
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Casner knew Troutt from their days racing horses in Omaha, Neb.
And after Casner's time selling firewood and tools, they got
together in the oil business. But that venture didn't go far
because of the bust in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Troutt, though, saw opportunity after the breakup of AT&AMP;T in
1984. Four years later, he founded Excel Communications, which
bought blocks of long-distance service at discounted rates and sold
them to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Casner was one of the original sales and marketing
representatives with Excel, which merged with Canada's Teleglobe 15
months ago in a deal valued at $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Casner has come a long way from chopping wood. But success in
horse racing might require a long struggle as well. Their farm _
Casner and Troutt have renamed it WinStar Farm _ is a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a much more intensive end of the business,'' said
Preston, whose family sold the farm for estate-planning purposes.
``We owned the farm for 12 or 13 years, and we lost money every
year before it turned around about four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes many years and lots of money, and it depends on how
clever you are choosing and developing a stallion. But \RCasner and
Troutt\S should do really well at it.''

CHAT ROOM ENCOUNTER LEADS TO WOMAN'S RESCUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANCIE LATOUR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Jeff Erlanger ventures into an online chat room at the end
of the day, it's usually to unwind _ stumble onto something
interesting, make a random connection.
</P>
<P>
   But when the 29-year-old Madison, Wis., resident signed on to an
America Online message board Thursday night, the one-on-one
conversation he had was anything but casual: A Boston woman, also
29 and alone in her apartment, told him she was trying to kill
herself.
</P>
<P>
   As he watched her words sputter across his screen, describing
dreams of a medical career and battles with manic-depression,
Erlanger knew just three facts: her first name, her online screen
name, and the city in which she lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really unbelievable, and terrifying,'' Erlanger said
Friday, recounting the chance meeting in cyberspace. The encounter
became a delicate rescue mission as Erlanger called authorities in
Wisconsin and Massachusetts seeking help.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime later, about 9:15 p.m., Boston police officers arrived
at the woman's Back Bay address and found her with fresh cuts on
her wrists, refusing to seek help.
</P>
<P>
   She was taken to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where she
was treated and examined, according to police spokesman Kevin
Jones. Police withheld her identity.
</P>
<P>
   Reached Friday night in his apartment at the University of
Wisconsin, Erlanger said he had no idea whether the woman he called
Sarah had lived or died after their encounter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping police would call me to tell me what happened,
but I had no idea if I'd ever hear about it again,'' Erlanger said.
``I'm obviously very, very glad that they were able to track her
down and help her.''
</P>
<P>
   When he first signed on to the public AOL chat board and found
Sarah, Erlanger decided on a whim to start a private conversation
with her because ``it seemed like someone I might want to chat
with.''
</P>
<P>
   He learned she was from Boston, said she was a dentist and
wanted to become a pediatric dentist.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Erlanger said, his screen acquaintance began revealing
more about herself _ that she was manic-depressive, that she had
been hospitalized, and that she had attempted suicide ``a bunch of
times.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the next thing she told me was that she had cut herself
and blood was going down her arms,'' he said. ``I tried to get her
to tell me her last name and she wouldn't. I asked her if she
wanted help. She said no.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he wasn't sure whether her desperation was real. With no
voice or face to match with the words, he said, Sarah could have
been perpetrating a twisted Internet hoax.
</P>
<P>
   Just when he decided he had to take action, Erlanger said, he
had a terrible realization: His computer modem, the link between
them, was occupying his only phone line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stuck between, do I keep talking to her, or do I leave
and go to another phone and leave her hanging?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Erlanger, who works with senior citizens in a program at the
university, made a quick evaluation. If Sarah truly wanted to
commit suicide, he reasoned, she probably would not have gotten
online.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand,'' he said, ``there was only so much I could
do by talking to her. It was a huge risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Without telling Sarah he was leaving his computer, Erlanger left
his room and raced through the building, frantically searching for
someone to call police. After several calls on a phone in the
downstairs lobby, he reached authorities in Madison, who told him
to call Boston police.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the line, the 911 operator in Boston told
him they could do little to help Sarah without her last name or
address.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes had passed.
</P>
<P>
   Erlanger returned to his computer to try to keep her talking.
She abruptly signed off. He called Boston police again. They told
him federal law allowed online companies to reveal a person's full
name in emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Erlanger tracked down the number for America Online, and gave it
and the woman's screen name to the emergency operator.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman at AOL said Friday he was not aware of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Surprised that his efforts had led to the woman's rescue,
Erlanger said the incident demonstrated the flip side to tales of
classic Web hoaxes and the cyber-terrorism that forced some Web
sites to shut down last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the Internet, but the problem is, there's no way of
knowing what someone's emotion is,'' Erlanger said. ``You have to
kind of evaluate the whole situation in an instant and ask whether
this is something you should act on or whether you should wait and
see if the person is joking.''

ROCKER IS TEEMING WITH PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ The Atlanta Braves are based at Disney
World during spring training, a fact that leads to the following
tableau: Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, and John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is a small world after all.
</P>
<P>
   There has been plenty of commentary about Rocker, the pitcher
who unintentionally prompted America to discuss racism, xenophobia,
and the First Amendment. But Friday was interesting, too. It was
like watching ``Alice in Wonderland'' with an Andrew Dice Clay
soundtrack. In the belly of a cartoon world, there were blunt and
subtle remarks about a pitcher whom most of the Braves dislike.
</P>
<P>
   That's one overlooked element of the Rocker story: Many of his
teammates can't stand him. Some didn't like him before he made his
comments in Sports Illustrated, comments that led baseball
commissioner Bud Selig to suspend him until May (the fine is being
appealed). The raging opinions just made things worse for Rocker in
the Braves' clubhouse, but not for the reasons you might think.
</P>
<P>
   While the nation was focused on Rocker's words about
``foreigners'' and ``queers,'' the Braves had additional reasons
for disappointment. Rocker basically blamed teammate Ozzie Guillen
for a loss in Game 4 of the National League Championship Series. He
questioned the moves of manager Bobby Cox. He talked about the
serene culture of the clubhouse, an atmosphere that has been
established by respected veterans such as Tom Glavine, John Smoltz,
and Greg Maddux. He called another teammate a monkey.
</P>
<P>
   All of these words may not raise the ire of the NAACP, but you
can be sure that if Rocker ever returns to the Braves _ which I
doubt he will _ he will be asked, first, why he dogged his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a lot of making up to do,'' Braves outfielder Brian
Jordan said Friday. Jordan, who is black, said he initially tried
taking ``the Christian approach'' with Rocker. ``If God can forgive
me for my sins, who am I to judge Rocker?'' he said. ``Should he be
condemned by me?''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan could not maintain that position for long. He was asked
if Rocker's suspension should be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``Let him take the time and think about some
things.''
</P>
<P>
   He was asked if he agrees that Rocker's toughest punishment
would be to come to Disney World and face his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't agree with that,'' he said. ``I think his biggest
punishment will be going to New York. Some people say he shouldn't
travel to New York. Why not? He should go. He made that bed, now
he's got to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   As many Braves emphasized Friday, liking Rocker is not a
criterion for winning. Baseball players, and most pro athletes and
coaches for that matter, often don't get credit for a rare quality:
They are able to push their biases aside so they don't get in the
way of their self-interests (winning). Author David Maraniss has a
good example of this in his biography of Vince Lombardi. The
legendary coach is usually characterized as a hard-edged leader, a
so-called ``man's man.'' But when Lombardi, as head coach of the
Redskins, found out he had a gay running back, it didn't faze him;
the guy could still run the ball, right?
</P>
<P>
   So even though catcher Eddie Perez had unflattering remarks
about Rocker (``He's stupid''), it doesn't mean the pitcher can't
play with this team. Remember, we are still talking about a
25-year-old lefthander who throws 95 miles per hour, has a wicked
slider, and _ bombast aside _ has 38 saves to show for his first
full season with the Braves. But many of those who have been around
him said he won't make it if he doesn't change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something must have been wrong with his head that day (he made
the comments),'' first baseman Andres Galarraga said. ``I think he
was having a bad day.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga is one of the nicest men you will ever meet. He is
being kind. Rocker's bad day started long before he spit at an
Atlanta toll machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``His attitude will have to change,'' said Jordan, who halfway
joked that ``I'll kick his butt if I get hit with a battery in New
York.'' Jordan said Rocker will have to tone down his frequent
dugout tantrums. He will also have to learn to control his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was asked if he thought Rocker's ``monkey'' comment was
directed at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I knew who he was talking about as soon as I saw it,''
Jordan said. ``I think everybody on this team did.''
</P>
<P>
   When Braves general manager John Schuerholz was questioned about
the future of Rocker Friday, I couldn't tell whether he was
espousing Disney philosophy or just being coy. After giving an
evasive response about a possible Rocker trade, the general manager
said, ``That's my Fred Astaire answer.''
</P>
<P>
   He then said there isn't a sports team ``or newspaper staff''
that can boast of all-around harmony among employees. This is true.
But if I don't like someone at the Globe, I don't have to see them
and travel with them from February until October. Baseball players
can't send in their work via laptop.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker will work somewhere this season. Cox had a team meeting
Friday in which he mentioned the pitcher (he didn't share any of
the meeting details). ``It's not hard to get three outs,'' he said
of his closer situation. ``I think we'll manage somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds as if he is prepared for a season without Rocker. If
the pitcher does leave, it won't be solely related to his hateful
words. The real problem is obvious: Rocker doesn't have respect for
his teammates, and the feeling is mutual.

RUSSIAN AIDE OPENS DOOR, A BIT, TO U.S. BID FOR MISSILE DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A senior Russian national security official who met
with President Clinton Friday appeared to open the door slightly to
meeting the administration's desire to deploy a limited national
missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   But the official, Sergei Ivanov, the head of Russia's national
security council, also said Russia wanted to keep the essence of
the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty that the administration is
seeking to change.
</P>
<P>
   After lengthy meetings at the White House Friday and on
Thursday, Ivanov told a news conference at the Russian Embassy
Friday evening that Moscow was prepared to discuss allowing the
United States to move its current authorized site, of a radar and
interceptors in North Dakota, to another location.
</P>
<P>
   The North Dakota site, allowed under the ABM Treaty and designed
to protect a field of intercontinental ballistic missiles, was
dismantled in the mid 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. arms control negotiators have told the Russians that they
want to move the site to Alaska, in order to protect the United
States from the threat of ballistic missile attacks from North
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are talking about the geographic changes to deploy the
system, instead of North Dakota, somewhere else,'' that was
possible, Ivanov said. ``This is going to be the subject of further
discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ivanov prefaced that remark by saying, `If we are talking
about slightly modifying the ABM Treaty at the same time as
deploying national missile defense, these two things simply can't
exist together.''
</P>
<P>
   The ABM Treaty, agreed to in 1972 and amended in 1974,
explicitly precludes a national missile defense system but allows
each side to deploy one system of defense that would protect just
one specific part of its territory.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has said Clinton will make a decision on whether
to deploy a limited missile defense system this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In a standard Russian defense of the ABM Treaty, Ivanov
described the treaty as ``extremely valuable to us _ among other
factors because it is very short, very clear and precise.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been pushing a proposal for a
limited national defense system _ meaning one that would protect
the United States from, say, tens of missiles from North Korea _
with the Russians since last year.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said it would have no comment on Ivanov's
remarks. ``There's not an overwhelming desire to shed much light,''
a spokesman for the National Security Council, Mike Hammer, said.
</P>
<P>
   During the talks in the last two days, Hammer said that senior
administration officials had tried to make clear that the missile
defense plan was not directed against Russia but against the common
threat that the United States and Russia faced from countries such
as North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov's talks here were the most intense between the
administration and a powerful Russian official since the acting
president, Vladimir Putin, took over the Kremlin on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials describe him as one of the
officials closest to Putin, and far more powerful than the Russian
foreign minister, Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   Like Putin, the national security head worked with the KGB and
its successor agency, the FSB.
</P>
<P>
   With his slim bearing and brisk manner, and at the same age as
Putin, 47, he resembles the acting president physically and
stylistically.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview with the newspaper Komsomolshaya Pravda,
Sergei Ivanov talked tough about Russia regaining its stature and
in particular about Russia's war in Chechnya. ``Carrying out a
large scale military operation, in my view, seems totally
justified,'' Ivanov said
</P>
<P>
   In that interview, he said that under Putin, Russia was
reversing the trend of having ``lost its voice'' and that now
Russia had showed ``we still know how to bite.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the news conference Friday at the Russian Embassy, Ivanov
was more polite and diplomatic. He said the purpose of his trip was
to ``exclude the emergence of surprises in our bilateral
relationship.'' He wanted, he said, to inject some
``predictability'' into the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Ivanov was asked about the whereabouts
of the Russian journalist Andrei Babitsky, who works for Radio Free
Europe/Radio Liberty, and is now missing, apparently in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky had angered the Russian government with his reporting.
He was held by Russian security forces last month and then,
according to the Russian government, was handed over to Chechen
forces in exchange for several Russian soldiers. He has not been
heard from since.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov said on Friday that Babitsky was with ``the rebels'' in
Chechnya. But he added, ``as far as I know our special services
know his whereabouts approximately'' inside Chechnya and which
rebel units he is with. ``I assure you that we will take all
possible efforts to get the release of Babitsky. The fate of any
Russian citizen is the cause of our concern.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THIRD-PARTY POLITICS ROCK AN INSTITUTION

<P>
   NEW YORK _ During funeral services for Reggie Carter at
Riverside Church in late December, the presiding minister
acknowledged the family of the former St. John's and Knicks star.
He surveyed the audience and asked if the man who was one of the
pillars of the church, and a mentor to Carter, would please stand.
The mourners looked over and looked back as an elderly man with
white hair, a long face and black horn-rimmed glasses slowly stood.
Ernie Lorch nodded and sat back down. Many had probably never seen
or heard of Ernie Lorch.
</P>
<P>
   Lorch first met Carter when Carter was barely a teen-ager in the
early 1960s, participating in Riverside's new basketball outreach
program. Lorch, who coached Carter, would coach two of Carter's
sons and the sons of many players who had passed through the
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was close to the program; we put him through school,''
Lorch said at the funeral, referring to Carter and the high school
that he attended. ``We helped him, we watched him.''
</P>
<P>
   Four decades later, almost everyone knows about the Riverside
basketball program. Even if they are not familiar with the famous
church, even if they don't know Lorch by sight, they know the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Lorch is a revered presence in high school and college
basketball circles and at high school games in New York and
throughout the country. N BA stars like Chris Mullin, Mark Jackson,
Elton Brand, Ron Artest, Stephon Marbury and Jerry Stackhouse
played for Riverside. Forty-five former Hawks dot the rosters of
several NCAA Division I programs, Lorch said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the NCAA's widening probe into the St. John's
University basketball program, Lorch, 67, is being forced to assume
an uncomfortably public profile as his relationship with Erick
Barkley is investigated to determine whether they violated NCAA
rules governing extra benefits. Specifically, the NCAA is looking
into whether Lorch, a lawyer , paid for all or part of Barkley's
tuition at Christ the King High School in New York City and at
Maine Central Institute, a prep school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to answer that,'' Lorch said Friday when he was
asked about the tuition payments. ``I am not going to get into
anything to do with a specific player. All I can say is that we've
been involved in this for 40 years and we haven't done anything
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   I wondered whether in 40 years Lorch had asked the NCAA
enforcement officials whether his support for players _ paying
their way to private high schools and prep schools _ fell within
NCAA guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had that discussion with them,'' he said. ``This is
our 40th year. We've never had a problem, nobody's ever said we've
done anything wrong. To read my name in this context is a very
disturbing thing. In a way it puts in question 50 percent of my
life's work because it's been at least 50 percent of my life's work
as compared to my legal practice and my business practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be 68 in October; suddenly somebody raises up and puts
you in the context of having done something corrupt. That is
seriously bothersome. I'm not going to comment on that.''
</P>
<P>
   If he has been doing this for 40 years, why are they now looking
into the program and Lorch's relationship with a player?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've asked myself why,'' Lorch said Friday. But the process is
complicated by moral questions, NCAA regulations and the most
important issue, though the one that is frequently buried: what is
right for the student athlete?
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Lorch has long list of memories: from Reggie Carter to
Erick Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA is attacking summer programs and amateurism, smashing
the current model even if it means treading on pre-enrollment
relationships between benevolent benefactors and ``the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no statute of limitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``How far back does this jurisdiction extend?'' Lorch said.
``Does it go back to when the kid was in kindergarten? What is
their jurisdiction over kids who are not in school? What right do
they have to regulate the lives of kids and the opportunities of
kids who aren't even in a member institution?''
</P>
<P>
   Lorch, St. John's and Erick Barkley are about to discover that
the NCAA, in pursuit of a goal, has a reach _ and a memory _ that
may even be longer than Lorch's.

WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE CLASS OF '93? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (For release Sunday, Feb. 20)  
 (bl)  
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ In the fall of 1995, two years after
graduating from Stanford University, Diane Barrum received a call
from her sophomore roommate, Srinija Srinivasan, asking her to join
a company recently founded by two other young Stanford alumni,
Jerry Yang and David Filo. The deal was this: In exchange for
18-hour days, grinding away in overcrowded conditions, Barrum would
get in early on a hot phenomenon called the Internet. But Barrum,
happily employed by a biotechnology company based in Seattle, said,
``I just was not ready to take the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrum, as it happens, turned down the chance to be employee No.
30 at Yahoo, the wildly successful Internet portal, or gateway,
which has a current market value of about $82 billion. Now she is
back in Palo Alto and, after a hiatus of traveling and joblessness,
has recently joined an Internet start-up, too. ``Of course, I wish
I'd taken it,'' she said of the Yahoo job. ``One can only imagine
what I'd be worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Such tales of quick riches and missed opportunities can be heard
in many places these days, among people of all ages. But probably
nowhere else was the swift, unexpected divergence of fortunes
thrown into such stark relief as among Barrum and her peers in the
Stanford undergraduate class of 1993, who burst on the scene just
as the World Wide Web was coming into its own.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, only a small percentage of recent college graduates
have become Internet millionaires. But there are enough from elite
universities, like Harvard, MIT and Stanford, that they are
influential far beyond their numbers. A look at a sampling from
this one Stanford class _ among the earliest to have so many
success stories _ makes this phenomenon clear.
</P>
<P>
   The university says it does not track the wealth of its alumni,
but school officials acknowledge that many in the class of '93 have
become wealthy unusually early. It includes five of the six
founders of the Internet portal Excite (now Excite(at)Home); three
founders of the online retailer of sporting goods, FogDog; one of
the first employees of Yahoo; a pioneer of Trilogy Software; and a
top executive with LinkShare. Many of these 20-somethings are now
worth tens of millions of dollars, if not more. When the class
gathered in 1998, it donated $163,000, then the largest class gift
for a five-year reunion _ only to be surpassed last year by the
Internet-rich class of '94.
</P>
<P>
   In part, these technology Wunderkinder strike a chord with their
peers because they have achieved the dual aspirations that have
defined Generation X: being passionate about work and free from
authority. But their existence has also raised the whole
generation's visions of early wealth and, for some, served as a
nagging reminder of what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``This generation has made its money so young that it is almost
unnatural,'' said Alan Wolfe, a sociologist who heads the Center
for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. ``Whether
you are repelled by these young millionaires or attracted by them,
they cannot be ignored. In that sense they are icons for their
peers.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford, in the heart of Silicon Valley, has turned out a
disproportionately large number of Web superstars. With top-rated
programs in science and engineering _ and almost 9 out of 10
undergraduates taking at least one computer course _ the
palm-lined, mission-style campus in Palo Alto has been ground zero
for the high-technology boom.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the class of '93, like Srinivasan and Barrum,
have seen their fates spun wildly apart by the Internet _ not so
much because of any particular differences in cleverness or
ambition, but because some of them happened to be very well placed
as the transformation began.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hennessey, the school's provost and former dean of the
engineering school, noted that 1993 was ``right on the cusp of the
Internet explosion.'' Like others on the Stanford faculty, he is
acutely aware that the success of the Internet has ushered in a new
era of student life.
</P>
<P>
   On its statistical face, the Stanford class of 1993 was almost
indistinguishable from its predecessors. It was split roughly 50-50
between men and women; about 7 percent of the class were
African-American; 17 percent were Asian-American. Students' majors
were not particularly skewed toward technology. Of the 1,730
degrees conferred, 6.6 percent were in engineering, 10 percent were
in economics and 16.7 percent in biology or human biology.
</P>
<P>
   But the more forward-looking graduates were ideally positioned
for the Internet economy. Not only had they been exposed to many
new technologies _ e-mail was nearly universal among Stanford
undergraduates by 1992, as were experimental high-speed
telecommunications lines _ but they also were entering the working
world well before the Internet sector was swamped with start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Rich alumni are nothing new for the university that graduated
William Hewlett and David Packard (class of '34), the founders of
one of Silicon Valley's first high-technology businesses. But not
so long ago, Stanford graduates expected success to take time.
</P>
<P>
   Herrant Katchadourian, a sociologist, is tracking an earlier
Stanford class, from 1981. In his book, ``The Cream of the Crop,''
graduates at their 10-year reunion reported widespread contentment
with their salaries, which averaged $54,000, roughly $18,000 above
the average then for college graduates. Many said proudly they
expected to earn as much as $1 million a year _ 10 to 15 years down
the road. Perhaps when he revisits them next year at their 20-year
anniversary for a new book, he will not find them so sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet has given the class of '93 and its successors a
far different timetable _ and even greater ambitions. Consider
Krista Rollins, 27, a 1993 graduate who is now vice president for
communications at Trilogy Software, based in Austin, Texas. She
once thought that her biggest career concerns would be salary,
title and the number of people she managed, but her idea of success
has changed. ``It used to be much more about the long term,'' she
said. ``Now it is about how to become very successful in the next
three or four years.'' By her mid-30s, or 40 at the latest, Rollins
hopes to be ``very financially independent'' _ that is, rich enough
to quit.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford faculty has noted the changing culture with mixed
emotions. James Montoya, vice provost for student affairs, has
sensed the acceleration in the student life cycle since the early
'90s, as undergraduates have moved to ``Internet time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be `I'll get out of school and travel and see the
world before I settle down,''' he said. ``But what I hear now is
`This is the time to join a start-up, before I get old and have
responsibilities, like a family.'''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, not every member of the class of '93 shares
this computer-industry intensity about striking it rich. According
to a class survey for the five-year reunion, some 12 percent called
high technology (separate from engineering) their field of endeavor
_ a big proportion, compared with most universities. But plenty of
other graduates were still in medical training or had begun other
careers, while some were taking time off to raise children. Still,
the existence of such sharply divergent paths has made young
graduates feel like players in some sort of modern lottery.
</P>
<P>
   THE PROGRAMMER: A Physics Major Makes Good
</P>
<P>
   Graham F. Spencer came to Stanford in 1989 with the intention of
becoming a physics major, but he was drawn more to computers. After
finishing school, he formed a company with five college friends to
build a software navigator for the newly emerging Web. Spencer,
whose major was computer science, is now acknowledged as the
programming genius behind the portal known as Excite.
</P>
<P>
   In the lean first years, he worked 80-hour weeks, getting by on
beans and rice. But before the company's initial public offering in
1997, Spencer netted 600,000 shares of Excite stock; his stake
would be worth $64 million at the time that the company merged with
At Home in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I deserve the money I have? I struggle with that a lot,''
the soft-spoken Spencer said. ``On some level, I'd like to believe
I have certain skills that have made me successful. But how can
being a little more competent at computer science make you so much
richer?''
</P>
<P>
   He describes himself as ``anti-ostentatious,'' saying he does
not go in for ``three cars a year and champagne.'' He and his
fiancee own a cozy new home in Palo Alto. In this money-flooded
valley, of course, plain-vanilla dwellings can run $1 million, but
this is no gizmo-filled palace; it is cramped enough that the
dining table occupies part of the living room.
</P>
<P>
   His great indulgence has been travel _ weekend trips to Vail,
Colo., to snowboard, or to Hawaii to surf. Recently, he and his
fiancee took a two-week trip to Italy, often staying in
$500-a-night rooms on the Amalfi coast. He also works at home
whenever he feels like it, padding around the house in his stocking
feet and keeping his Siamese cat company.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his low-key lifestyle, Spencer acknowledges that money
has altered his relationships with peers. He met his fiancee at
Excite and said it made a difference to both of them that she had
her own substantial stock holdings and had ``earned'' her right to
partake of the lush life.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, after his hometown newspaper in Columbia, S.C.,
splashed his net worth across the front page last year, high school
friends, he said, started treating him ``like some sort of
billionaire, which I am definitely not.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer plans to retire by the age of 40; in the meantime, he
wants to get a better sense of how to live without organizing all
his time around work. ``I hope I get more comfortable with spending
money,'' he said wistfully. ``The problem is that the only people I
know well who have this kind of money are like me _ they just got
it. None of us knows what we want to do with it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   It is almost as if Spencer is waiting around for legitimacy. He
has sold less than 5 percent of his stock and still puts in long
hours at Excite as a kind of superprogrammer. While he says he is
``basically a volunteer'' _ meaning that he does not have to work
if he does not want to _ he says he feels inextricably tied to the
long-term success of the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deliberately try not to keep score on my own net worth,
because that is gross at some level,'' he said. ``I want to feel
that we've built something sustainable, something great.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE E-RETAILER: Lots of Money But No Dates  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At 27, Robert Chea, founder of FogDog, does not look a day over
19 but has the poise of a 50-year-old chief executive. As the son
of Cambodian immigrants who struggled to put him through school,
Chea felt he had to be rich. ``I'd be disappointed in myself,'' he
said, ``if I did not make a lot of money.'' But even as a sophomore
in college, Chea wanted more than a fat bank account. He wanted
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he remembers, his concept of success came from an AT&AMP;T
commercial. The advertisement, which aimed to showcase the
liberating power of the company's digital technologies, showed
futuristic scenes of people receiving faxes in huts on tropical
islands. ``That was my measure of success,'' he said, ``to be at a
level where I had enough free time to sit on the beach, but was
still connected to the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The path to controlling his destiny almost eluded him. He
arrived at Stanford in 1989, interested in philosophy and
archaeology. But his mother nudged him toward electrical
engineering. Upon graduating, he applied to law school, thinking
that he would pursue a career as a patent lawyer. But through a
classmate's father, Chea got caught up in showing sporting-goods
makers how to use the Internet and eventually formed the company
that would become FogDog.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Chea, by his own accounting, has worked terrifically long hours
seven days a week for five years. But the results are clear. Last
fall, FogDog moved its headquarters from a nondescript, cramped
office park outside San Jose, , to a glorious, light-filled loft
near Redwood City, complete with stainless-steel fixtures and blond
wood desks. It is the sort of office that Heather Locklear, the
``Melrose Place'' diva, would inhabit if she ever signed up to do a
sitcom about being chief executive of an Internet start-up. Chea
owns 1.15 million shares of FogDog, which went public in December.
The shares are now worth $10.25 apiece, making his stake worth
$11.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   There have been personal costs. In his five-year class reunion
book, for example, Chea said only half-jokingly that he had not had
a date in five years. ``It's by choice dammit,'' he wrote. At a
recent birthday party, his friend Andy Chen, FogDog's co-founder,
felt so bad for Chea that he invited all 70 employees to write down
names of date possibilities in the form of a classified ad, letting
Chea choose three.
</P>
<P>
   Chea no longer has any desire to live on a tropical island and
talk to his officemates _ essentially his whole social universe _
by phone. And he has less desire to absent himself from the
technology culture that so enthralls him. ``I can't imagine what it
would be like,'' he said, ``to be a lawyer and hear about the
Internet all the time and not get to participate in it.''
</P>
<P>
   THE NONCONFORMIST: Looking Beyond The Internet Life
</P>
<P>
   While the potential of the Internet economy has dazzled many
graduates, it has left a distinct minority of the 1993 class
feeling nonplused _ and left out.
</P>
<P>
   In another time, San Francisco might have seemed like a slice of
paradise to Elaine Romanelli, a music major who prides herself on
spontaneity and artistic aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bay Area landscape has changed greatly since the 1970s,
when Stanford was a center of radical student protest and San
Francisco a mecca of counterculture.
</P>
<P>
   Romanelli misses being part of a generation that followed its
heart, regardless of money. She has tried hard to hold on and
recreate a bit of that spirit. Her work life since college has
included being a co-founder of a business that provided ``haikus on
demand'' (two for a dollar) and quitting a respectable job in
marketing to try her hand at professional singing. She lives in a
dilapidated Victorian house in the grittier South End of San
Francisco and frequents a local cafe that is a sympathetic home to
creative types.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as a Stanford graduate living in San Francisco, she has
not been able to avoid the Web rat race. ``The Internet is a
pervasive presence here,'' she said. ``Many, many jobs are
Web-based, and e-commerce just sort of permeates everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Romanelli is a petite woman with delicate features, and her eyes
flash when she is asked about the Stanford stars of the moment. She
is far from worshipful. ``The thing that gets to me,'' she said,
``is that the people getting wealthy are young, single boys.'' In
previous generations, she said, real wealth could take decades to
accumulate, but her peers ``don't have coping tools'' for the vast
sums they are now able to spend.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are getting rich and spending their money on
`supersoakers''' _ as exceedingly expensive toys like Jaguars and
automated houses are known in the parlance of Silicon Valley.
``They don't have a sense of philanthropy or giving back to the
community _ or any community outside of work.''
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of the Web leaves Romanelli cold, even a little
indignant. ``A society of people who write to each other solely by
computer is not my idea of utopia,'' she said. She has watched
friends and classmates devote themselves to Internet start-ups, and
she believes their lives are too narrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an insane amount of money, but also an insane amount
of work. It is like slave labor.'' The computer, she said, ``was
supposed to facilitate life; out here, it has worked the other way
around.''
</P>
<P>
   THE WEB EDITOR: Feeling Fulfilled In Love of Work  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the financial gulf that separates Srinivasan, who joined
Yahoo, and Barrum, who did not, they remain comfortable friends.
There is no animosity or visible jealousy, just a tacit acceptance
of changed circumstances. For a dinner of take-out Indian,
Srinivasan pays and Barrum picks it up.
</P>
<P>
   It helps that, like many other young Stanford millionaires,
Srinivasan, who had an interdisciplinary major called symbolic
systems, eschews aggressive displays of wealth. She lives in a
loft-style duplex in one of the least fancy areas of Palo Alto,
among graduate students and Internet worker bees. She dresses in
print skirts with matching pastel T-shirts, a low-cost uniform of
working women everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   When she and Barrum, who majored in human biology, spread out on
the tan sofas in her living room to chat, they talk about family
(both are close to their parents), about friends from college and
about eventually juggling careers with children (both are single).
When it comes to money, both acknowledge they are more than a
little stunned at the turns of fate. ``Don't get me wrong _ Srinija
has worked very hard and I always knew she would be successful at
something,'' Barrum said. ``But I never thought she'd be a big deal
at a company at age 28, and she did not either.''
</P>
<P>
   Srinivasan, who as the fifth employee at Yahoo is probably worth
tens of millions (she will not say), concedes that her sudden
wealth has taken her by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked hard and I don't think I am dumb and I am deeply
passionate about my work,'' she said. ``But in no way has my effort
been proportionately rewarded. Emotionally, that is something you
have to come to terms with.''
</P>
<P>
   She considers herself successful, not because of what she is
worth, she said, but because she loves what she does. As vice
president and editor in chief of Yahoo, she leads a team that sorts
the ever-expanding constellation of Web sites into categories that
will make sense to subscribers. When tough calls arise at work _
like whether messianic Jews should be listed under Judaism or
Christianity _ she has stomachaches that keep her awake at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly spend my days in ways that I feel are engaging,
compelling and fulfilling and rewarding,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Barrum nods at her friend's words. ``When I was living away from
Palo Alto, I felt there was all this excitement going on here and
all these young people having a real effect on so many companies,''
she said. ``I felt I was missing out. I came back not for the
money, but for the excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she adds that living life in the Internet center, it is
difficult to be 28 and not yet a success without occasionally
feeling uneasy. ``You can't deny that knowing people who have
gotten wealthy changes your perspective on some things,'' Barrum
said. ``I feel like I am falling behind in the race to buy a house,
a race to achieve monetary goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Will she have another shot at Internet riches? ``Yahoo is not
going to slip into the ocean,'' she said, ``but it is not going to
make a lot of millionaires anymore.''

 &HT;    Renegade Anglicans only invite anarchy
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Anarchy can get out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Episcopal Church may be the poster child for that clichefor
all religious communities.
</P>
<P>
   In January, renegade African bishops from sister churches of the
Anglican Communion ordained two American clergymen to be bishops
for disaffected Episcopalians in this country.
</P>
<P>
   They have no authority to do that. The result is confusing,
irregular at best and possibly the stuff of schism.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters call it prophetic. Critics call it blasphemy. Some
think it is payback for liberal anarchy in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   The surface issues, then and now, are _ what else? _ sex and
sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   But the crisis is a question of authority: Who makes decisions
for the church, and on what grounds are they made? That conundrum
plagues all denominations. Episcopalians seem to wallow in it.
</P>
<P>
   The Anglican Communion is a loose federation of independent
churches with ties to the Church of England.
</P>
<P>
   Some Anglicans disagree with the Episcopal Church in America.
Perceived leniency toward homosexuality and the ordination of women
to the priesthood are the sticking points.
</P>
<P>
   So, in Singapore, three African bishops ordained two like-minded
bishops to work in America, where they have no jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative bishops were doing what liberal American
bishops did earlier _ claim unilaterally to know God's will.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, three retired Episcopal bishops ordained 11 women in
Philadelphia to the all-male priesthood without permission of the
national church, which had sole authority to approve the act.
</P>
<P>
   The national church rightly approved the ordination of women two
years later, but the damage to the church's decision-making process
had been done.
</P>
<P>
   All agree that authority in the church rests with Jesus. The
problem is how the faithful discern his will. The Bible needs
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   The early church insisted that God's Spirit taught the Church
when its leaders met in councils. Bishops drew their authority from
those meetings. They did not have authority to act apart from the
will of God discerned by the church in council.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the bishop of Rome overturned that and concentrated
all authority in the Catholic Church in his hands. Today, the Pope
alone speaks for his church.
</P>
<P>
   In the Episcopal Church, authority rests in a convention of
bishops, priests and laity, which meets every three years. But some
bishops think they have a direct pipeline to Jesus. They become
their own pope.
</P>
<P>
   That happened in Philadelphia nearly 26 years ago and in
Singapore last month. Each group insists their act was prophetic
and the other blasphemous.
</P>
<P>
   Genuine prophetic acts are Spirit-filled assaults, often on the
numbing institutional bureaucracy that can pervert the will of God.
</P>
<P>
   But the faithful need be watchful.
</P>
<P>
   Many so-called prophetic acts are ego trips by hubris-filled
clerics. That's an invitation to anarchy.

PUTTING THE MUSCLE BACK ON A RARE CAR'S BONES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DILYS BURKE-MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who has tried to restore an old car can talk at length
about the frustrations _ a months-long search for a small strip of
original chrome, a replacement convertible top that didn't quite
fit. The stakes are higher if the car isn't just old, but is one of
a kind. That is especially true if one is dealing with a muscle car
that doesn't just have to look aggressive, but also needs the guts
to back up its macho image.
</P>
<P>
   David H. Pierce knows the score. The crew chief for Kent Ritter
Racing, a dragster team based in Wellesville, N.Y., he had already
restored a 1968 Camaro and a 1964 Pontiac GTO before tackling a
more ambitious project: a Dodge Coronet 440-series hardtop with
Chrysler Corp.'s famous 426 Hemi engine and an automatic
transmission, a rare combination in 1966. (He says 92 were made,
though factory records list 288.) But Pierce's Dodge may be unique;
he says it was the only '66 Coronet Hemi to get high-performance
tweaks from Norman Kraus, a k a ``Mr. Norm,'' the best-known of the
high-performance ``tuners'' who turned Chrysler muscle cars into
fearsome street racers.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce, of the Rensselaer County hamlet of Stephentown, said
records from Mr. Norm's Grand Spaulding Dodge dealership in Chicago
indicated that this was the only '66 Coronet Hemi modified there.
It was given headers, which are tubular steel exhaust manifolds of
equal lengths, allowing equal air flow through each cylinder; a
hood scoop (since replaced with louvers); a special camshaft;
high-compression pistons; a tachometer; and a trunk-mounted battery
for better weight distribution. It rolled out the door with a
sticker price of $3,273 and an environmentally incorrect
516-horsepower engine (up from an awesome 425 for unmodified
Hemis). It could run from a stop to 60 miles an hour in as little
as four seconds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For six years, the Dodge was ``driven hard,'' Pierce says, in
stoplight drag races. By the time its second owner, Tim Davis of
Indianapolis, took possession 10 years later, it was in poor
condition. Aware that he had a one-of-a-kind car, Davis intended to
restore it, but never found the time. The car sat in an open field
for much of a decade, seemingly destined to become a rusted-out
relic of a bygone era.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce, 43, learned about the car in 1994. He had it transported
from Indiana to New York and began trying to restore its former
glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognized that it was a Mr. Norm's car,'' he said,
explaining why he bothered, ``and that I would have a sought-after
car after I completed the renovation.'' Indeed, renewed interest in
Hemis may have made the car more valuable than he had expected; he
estimates its worth at $40,000 to $50,000, a range supported by
recent auction sales.
</P>
<P>
   An ardent muscle-car enthusiast with a passion for rare,
less-known models like the Coronet, Pierce spent three and a half
years transforming it. He estimates that the effort took 1,500
hours of work, 400 phone calls and $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``To achieve this, you've got to love cars, love doing this kind
of work, and not worry about the money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It took Pierce more than a month to disassemble the car,
carefully removing thousands of pieces down to the nuts and bolts
that held everything together. Each piece was evaluated as to
whether it could be saved; those that made the grade were
sandblasted or hand-sanded, then cleaned _ ``the most boring job,''
he said with a groan.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge was tracking down crucial parts that are
no longer made. ``Some could have been replaced with newer ones
made for other vehicles,'' Pierce said, ``but in order to restore
the car to its true, original form I felt it was important that all
parts be original.''
</P>
<P>
   After months of Internet searches and advertising in Hemmings
Motor News _ a thick monthly publication crammed with ads for old
cars and parts _ often discouraged and frustrated by blind leads,
Pierce was finally able to order the parts he needed. When oddly
shaped packages _ a fender, vent windows, door handles _ started to
arrive, he said he began to feel for the first time that the
project would succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Restoring and rebuilding the engine _ ``Hemi'' alludes to its
hemispherical combustion chambers _ was also a challenge. To make
the car authentic and capable of its original performance, Pierce
obtained a copy of Mr. Norm's tuning manual. As he carefully put
the engine together, he calibrated the various components to Mr.
Norm's exact specifications.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance the Dodge seems a bit dull _ the restorer
concedes that it looks like a ``grandma's car'' _ but the engine's
thunder at full throttle is breathtaking. Its performance is
``better than I thought it would be,'' Pierce said, adding, ``It
runs far better than any other muscle car I've had.''
</P>
<P>
   After rebuilding the engine, he spent seven months reassembling
the body and interior. He did the work himself, with the exception
of some painting; reupholstering the seats and replacing the
headliner; and rechroming the steel parts and reanodizing the
aluminum. The car, still bearing an original sticker from Mr.
Norm's dealership, is now like new and running strong. Pierce said
it could reach 160 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the car being in such bad shape and the parts being so
hard to come by, this was, by a long shot, the hardest'' of his
restorations, he said. ``But it was worth the effort.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every piece is original to the car _ it's a complete
matching-number car,'' he said, using the parlance for a vehicle
with the same mechanical pieces it had when new.
</P>
<P>
   Having invested so much love in his labor, would he sell the
car? He smiled wryly and said, ``Make me an offer I can't refuse.''
</P>
<P>
   And what would he do with the money? ``Somewhere out there,
there is another one of these rare muscle cars _ say, a Chevy
Chevelle LS6 or a Buick GS 455 Stage One _ on the verge of
extinction. If I were to sell the Hemi, the money would definitely
be used to rescue other cars like this one.'' &QL;

LEADER BOARD NEEDS WOODS TO ADJUST IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TOM SPOUSTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PACIFIC PALISADES, Calif. _ A week after Tiger Woods' quest to
extend his winning streak commanded record television ratings, the
PGA Tour leader board turned viewer unfriendly Friday at the Nissan
Open, where the weekend will become a scramble to see who can end
losing streaks or notch first career victories.
</P>
<P>
   Among the second-round leaders, only J.P. Hayes and Tommy Armour
III have won Tour events in the last five years, and those remain
their only victories. Only Bob Tway, who shared the 36-hole lead at
nine-under-par 133 with Greg Chalmers, was in the top 64 of the
world golf ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Scores cooled considerably at Riviera Country Club following a
first round in which 67 of 144 players broke par-71. Few charged
hard enough to generate the excitement of Woods and weeks past.
</P>
<P>
   Tway continued his fine, steady play with a four-under-par 67
that included three straight birdies from No. 12 to 14. Chalmers, a
second-year Tour pro from Perth, Western Australia, remained
consistent with a 66.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley Hughes made the biggest move, jumping into a tie for
fourth place with a 66, joining Tom Scherrer (68) at
seven-under-par 135.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, tied with Jeff Freeman in third place at 134, broke
through for his lone victory at the 1998 Buick Classic. Armour,
whose 68 put him at 136, has a 1990 Phoenix Open victory to show
for his efforts. Tway, a seven-time winner on Tour, last won at the
1995 MCI Classic.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Considering their recent histories, these guys are just happy to
be in the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just steadily improved every year, and ever since I won on
the Nike Tour in 1996, I've played pretty well,'' Hayes said,
referring to the satellite tour for players who fail to qualify for
the PGA Tour, now known as the Buy.com Tour. ``The differences
between the two tours are the difficulty of the courses and the
money. You can't slack off. You've got to play well to keep your
job out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Scherrer: ``I'm very happy with my play. The last time I
played here, I shot nine over par and missed the cut. This place
ate me up.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   So where was Woods on a day when ground was to be gained? He was
shooting 70 and making a double bogey that stole the early momentum
of his round. He recovered nicely, though, with two birdies on his
back nine and finished at four-under 138, which was five shots off
the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Considering his recent history, Woods appears ready to pounce on
this leader board and start another winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't an easy 70 for Woods, who began his round at No. 10
and displayed an uncharacteristic lapse in his short game at the
par-4 13th hole. After he launched his pitching-wedge approach shot
into the gallery, Woods' chip landed short of the fringe. He
elected to chip again, knocked the ball 10 feet past the hole and
two-putted for a six. The double bogey dropped Woods, who had made
birdie at No. 11, to two under par.
</P>
<P>
   Woods returned to three under at No. 1, a short par-5 that he
easily reached in two shots. A long eagle attempt ended with a
tap-in birdie. Six consecutive pars later, Woods dropped to four
under at No. 8 with a seven-footer for birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' frustration included birdie putts that hit the hole and
spun out at Nos. 12 and 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just really frustrated with the putts not going in;
they're good putts,'' Woods said. ``It's just one of those things
with ... greens where late in the evening you see the grass
starting to grow seed. It gets real thatchy and real bumpy, and
it's a challenge, no doubt.''

<P>
   Day traders and momentum investors probably won't be interested
in this article.
</P>
<P>
   Because what we're talking about here is looooong-term
investing. The people in Atlanta who for years and years have owned
shares in a certain local company that makes soda pop will
understand. So will those who a few decades ago entrusted some
money to a brainy guy in Omaha. So, too, will that brainy guy
himself, Warren E. Buffett.
</P>
<P>
   What we've done is to ask 10 very smart, very successful
investment professionals to pick one stock each _ a stock that
barring an act of God or some unforeseeable geopolitical disaster
they would feel comfortable buying now and holding until Jan. 1,
2010.
</P>
<P>
   The stocks they selected are an eclectic lot. None of the
managers mentioned many of the best performers of the 1990s _ not
Microsoft, not Qualcomm, not EMC. On the other hand, more than a
few participants picked stocks they have already owned for 10 years
_ fairly remarkable for people whose livelihoods depend in whole or
in part on how their stock picks do over the short term. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This article is (italics)not(end italics) an attempt to identify
the stocks that will do the best in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The lists of the best-performing stocks of past decades are
peppered with names of companies that flared and then flailed,
companies that only the most prescient, lead-bellied investor would
have bought at the start of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   In the fullness of time, a few of the stocks that our financial
professionals have selected may wind up on the best-dressed list of
the '00s. Most probably will not.
</P>
<P>
   Given the track records of the participants, however, when the
time comes to look back, the odds are that the bulk of these
companies will have qualified as good long-term investments.
</P>
<P>
   See you in 2010. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John W. Ballen &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MFS Emerging Growth Fund &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Oracle &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Ballen doesn't mind holding stocks for a decade. His top
pick for the next decade is a stock that has been in his portfolio
since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oracle is a stock we have owned for 10 years, so it would be a
20-year hold,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ballen, who manages the $19 billion MFS Emerging Growth fund,
has fairly basic criteria for buying and holding a stock. ``You
want a company with a dominant market position, a company a number
of other companies are betting their future on,'' he said. ``You
want a company with great cash flow and a stable balance sheet in a
high growth market. And you want management that can execute.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to Oracle, a company that Ballen says is
``morphing into the software company of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are already emerging as the software company on the
Internet,'' he said, noting Oracle's success in providing
databases, applications and business-to-business transaction sites.
``And that is going to be a place you want to be for the next 10
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Oracle is scarcely a secret to most investors. The stock is
selling at about 125 times next year's earnings. But the lofty
valuation shouldn't be a problem, said Ballen, whose fund had an
annualized rate of return of 24.9 percent during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``By traditional measures, the stock is not cheap,'' he
acknowledged. ``But if you are looking at a 10-year hold, the
current valuation parameters won't matter. If their earnings can
grow significantly, the multiple will be far less'' in 2010. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Laszlo Birinyi &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Nokia &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For a stock to stay in his portfolio for 10 years, said Birinyi,
a bullish global trading strategist, it must represent a stake in a
company that thinks, well, globally.
</P>
<P>
   A company's ``outlook on the world is important,'' he said.
``Managements change. But you want to find companies who may not
yet be part of the global village, but who will be. That means
identifying companies with products based on concepts that can
travel.''
</P>
<P>
   In his view, Nokia, the Finnish maker of cellular phones, fits
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have stayed well ahead of the curve in telecommunications
and cell phones,'' said Birinyi, whose predictions of the stock
market's trajectory were consistently among the most bullish for
much of the 1990s and proved much closer to the mark than most of
his peers'.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people have the ability to come out with new products,''
he said of Nokia. ``In Europe, cell phones are almost as ubiquitous
as car keys. As the third world develops, that is going to be a
huge market.
</P>
<P>
   The big rise in Nokia's stock price during the last 10 years _
its total return was more than 3,600 percent _ doesn't bother
Birinyi much.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock probably won't do better than it did in the 1990s,
but it will continue to rise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Birinyi said shares of companies that have done well ``have a
tendency to continue to do well, especially if they are being
innovative and inventing new products.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   George A. Mairs 3rd &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mairs &AMP; Power Growth Fund
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Medtronic &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The notion of sticking with a stock for a decade isn't foreign
to Mairs. His $477 million Mairs &AMP; Power Growth Fund isn't an
active buyer and seller of stocks. According to data from
Morningstar, the fund's average annual turnover rate during the
1990s was just 2 percent. But the returns have been solid: an
annual average of 18.3 percent for the decade that just ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking for companies with durable franchises, ones
that have been around for at least 10 years,'' Mairs said. ``We are
also looking for companies that have a leading market share. If we
find companies that qualify on that basis, we are comfortable
holding stocks for years, even decades.''

SMU WOMEN EMERGING NATIONALLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the past nine years, the history of SMU women's basketball
under Rhonda Rompola has been an unbroken string of success ...
nary a losing season at a program that previously had seldom known
a winning one.
</P>
<P>
   The ledger includes five trips to the NCAA Tournament in the
past six years, a fact that adds considerable weight to Rompola's
unhesitant reply to a recent question.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if this is her best SMU team, she said, ``Yes, it is.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Mustangs (16-6, 9-1 Western Athletic Conference) take
the floor against UT-El Paso at Moody Coliseum at 2 p.m. today,
they will be seeking to maintain the pace in a neck-and-neck race
with Hawaii for the regular-season conference title.
</P>
<P>
   Since the teams have split their two games against each other _
each won at home _ there seems a good chance they might ultimately
settle the issue at the WAC Tournament in Fresno, Calif. (March
8-11). In an odd twist of fate, the winner of the WAC women's
tournament will receive an automatic NCAA Tournament bid, and the
men's winner will not. The Mustangs, who won last year's tournament
and automatic bid, will be seeking a repeat performance.
</P>
<P>
   Rompola, of course, is taking nothing for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``After this weekend, we close the regular season with three
tough road games, against TCU, Rice and Tulsa,'' she said. ``There
are a lot of good teams in this league, and anything can happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I really feel good about this team, and if we play the way
we're capable of playing, we should be able to finish strong.
Obviously, I think this is a team that can win the tournament, but
even if we don't, I would still feel confident about our \RNCAA
Tournament\S chances. Because of our schedule, we have a good RPI
rating.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the Mustangs played a hefty early schedule, including
consecutive road games at No. 16 Texas Tech, No. 24 Tulane and No.
22 LSU. That resulted in something no Rompola team had ever
experienced: a five-game losing streak. The team rebounded with a
school-record 12-game winning streak, finally snapped by a 63-51
loss at Hawaii last weekend. The Mustangs resumed their winning
ways Thursday against Fresno State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We struggled early in the season, but the Christmas break came
at a very opportune time,'' Rompola said. ``We had time to make
some adjustments, and we've been playing much better since then. I
think we handled the winning streak pretty well, because we didn't
talk about it. But sometimes you get into a comfort zone when
you're winning, and I worried about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally lost to a good team at Hawaii last weekend, but it
was a strange game. We had 30 more shots than they did and 18
offensive rebounds. But we shot 20-something percent, and that's
why we lost. Hopefully, it will serve as a wakeup call.''
</P>
<P>
   A meeting between the teams at Moody earlier in the season
resulted in a 17-point victory for SMU, indicating that the two
could produce a memorable shootout if they meet in the WAC
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Mustangs are led by 6-foot-1 senior forward Karlin Kennedy
(15.0 ppg., 8.9 rpg.), bidding to become the program's first
All-American since Rompola herself in 1982. Kennedy is SMU's career
scoring leader and has also set a record for blocked shots while
ranking second in rebounding. Dallas native D-dra Rucker, who has
averaged 15.4 points after transferring from San Diego State, has
helped take some pressure off Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The Mustangs still play their muscular inside game, but this
team, Rompola said, has a different quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more quickness, and it's a very athletic group,'' she
said. ``We still sometimes use the defense to jump-start the
offense, and we're not a great outside shooting team. But we get a
lot of our points off the transition, and if we can establish our
perimeter game, it's probably the key to how we play the rest of
the season.'' nn

 &HT;    NFL star's attorneys file motion for speedy trial
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy and Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ray Lewis' defense team formally requested a speedy
trial Friday, forcing prosecutors to prepare for a trial that would
start by June.
</P>
<P>
   The speedy trial demand allows the defense team to dictate the
timetable of this case and makes a public declaration that the
defense team is confident in their case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want this to be tried,'' said Lewis attorney Don Samuel.
</P>
<P>
   The request for a speedy trial is automatically granted by the
court. ``If we file it and it's not tried by then, it's an
acquital,'' said Samuel.
</P>
<P>
   But the request alone does not guarentee a trial by June.
Prosecutors in some cases make the request only to change their
mind and withdraw the motion later on.
</P>
<P>
   The request would bring a speedy trial for all three defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Under Georgia law, filing the speedy trial request forces the
case to be tried within two court terms. In Fulton County, that
means June.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard shot off his own
threat Friday, saying he's considering asking a judge to revoke
Lewis' bond and put him back in an Atlanta jail. Howard believes
Lewis violated the terms of his bond by proclaiming his innocence
during a press conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at that right now,'' Howard said. ``We're
looking at what he said and the conditions of the bond.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' camp didn't flinch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not even close,'' Samuel said. ``The order doesn't say
you won't talk. It says you'll abide by the code of responsiblity.
The code of responsibility applies to lawyers. If that ever applies
to a defendant, I'd be shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Should a quick trial end in aquittal, Lewis could join the
Baltimore Ravens for the start of training camp in late July with
no restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Froelich, a former state and federal prosecutor, drew an
analogy to the O.J. Simpson criminal case. There, prosecutors moved
too quickly to indict and defense attorneys countered by seeking a
speedy trial motion, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what jammed (prosecutors),'' Froelich said. ``They
didn't get some tests back till after the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore attorney Dwight Pettit said the defense is making a
smart move. ``Just in what I have seen, the state is so pressed for
evidence, it would be the better strategy to go ahead and press
them, make them play ball right away,'' Pettit said. Pettit
represents the woman who filed assault charges against Lewis in
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Usually, it's in defendant's best interest to have
time. But in this case, it might be best to maintain the public
pressure and make them produce what they have.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, it remains unclear whether the three defendants will be
tried together. For instance, a death penalty case would
automatically separate the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Sadow, who represents co-defendant Joseph Sweeting, said
any of the attorneys can also request to have their cases tried
separately. But he doesn't envision filing such a motion, and would
be surprised if defendant Reginald Oakley's attorney files such a
request.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not envision anyone asking for it, other than possibly
Ray Lewis.'' Sadow said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, 24, and two acquaintances were indicted last week on
murder and assault charges in the stabbing of Jacinth Baker and
Richard Lollar on Super Bowl night. The Baltimore Ravens' All-Pro
linebacker was released Tuesday on $1 million bail.
</P>
<P>
   On his first full day back home, Lewis kept a low profile in the
city blanketed in snow and ice.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, he attended an initial interview with Maryland
officials monitoring his pre-trial release. The All-Pro linebacker
spent 45 minutes in Baltimore Circuit Court where he agreed to a
number of conditions, including a curfew, travel restrictions,
random home visits and drug testing. Lewis also agreed to submit a
daily itinerary to corrections officials.
</P>
<P>
   He was escorted by Baltimore Sheriff's deputies and went into
the courthouse through an employees-only entrance.
</P>
<P>
   After that, he spent much of Friday at his house in suburban
Baltimore County. The house is located on a winding and hilly
cul-de-sac lined with about a dozen other cavernous houses
separated from each other by spacious yards with a few trees.
</P>
<P>
   A young man who said he was Lewis' brother answered the doorbell
Friday afternoon. He said Lewis was ``doing fine.''
</P>

The code of responsibility applies to lawyers. If that ever applies
to a defendant, I'd be shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Should a quick trial end in aquittal, Lewis could join the
Baltimore Ravens for the start of training camp in late July with
no restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Froelich, a former state and federal prosecutor, drew an
analogy to the O.J. Simpson criminal case. There, prosecutors moved
too quickly to indict and defense attorneys countered by seeking a
speedy trial motion, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what jammed (prosecutors),'' Froelich said. ``They
didn't get some tests back till after the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore attorney Dwight Pettit said the defense is making a
smart move. ``Just in what I have seen, the state is so pressed for
evidence, it would be the better strategy to go ahead and press
them, make them play ball right away,'' Pettit said. Pettit
represents the woman who filed assault charges against Lewis in
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Usually, it's in defendant's best interest to have
time. But in this case, it might be best to maintain the public
pressure and make them produce what they have.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, it remains unclear whether the three defendants will be
tried together. For instance, a death penalty case would
automatically separate the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Sadow, who represents co-defendant Joseph Sweeting, said
any of the attorneys can also request to have their cases tried
separately. But he doesn't envision filing such a motion, and would
be surprised if defendant Reginald Oakley's attorney files such a
request.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not envision anyone asking for it, other than possibly
Ray Lewis.'' Sadow said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, 24, and two acquaintances were indicted last week on
murder and assault charges in the stabbing of Jacinth Baker and
Richard Lollar on Super Bowl night. The Baltimore Ravens' All-Pro
linebacker was released Tuesday on $1 million bail.
</P>
<P>
   On his first full day back home, Lewis kept a low profile in the
city blanketed in snow and ice.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, he attended an initial interview with Maryland
officials monitoring his pre-trial release. The All-Pro linebacker
spent 45 minutes in Baltimore Circuit Court where he agreed to a
number of conditions, including a curfew, travel restrictions,
random home visits and drug testing. Lewis also agreed to submit a
daily itinerary to corrections officials.
</P>
<P>
   He was escorted by Baltimore Sheriff's deputies and went into
the courthouse through an employees-only entrance.
</P>
<P>
   After that, he spent much of Friday at his house in suburban
Baltimore County. The house is located on a winding and hilly
cul-de-sac lined with about a dozen other cavernous houses
separated from each other by spacious yards with a few trees.
</P>
<P>
   A young man who said he was Lewis' brother answered the doorbell
Friday afternoon. He said Lewis was ``doing fine.''

 UNDATED: even decades.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   His top pick for the next decade is Medtronic, which also
happens to be the fund's second-largest holding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the leading implantable medical device company in the
world today, and has been for 25 years,'' Mairs explained. ``They
have an exceedingly strong franchise _ one that is so strong that
they have added to their product line by buying other companies.''
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roger McNamee &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Integral Capital Partners &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Flextronics International &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It may seem counterintuitive, but venture capitalists are often
buy-and-hold investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cisco has been part of our portfolio since just after it went
public in 1990,'' said McNamee, whose firm makes venture capital
and public investments in technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have owned Microsoft and Intel for much of the last decade,
and Oracle for most of that time,'' he said. ``Their common
characteristic is that they were all positioned in front of very
large business opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, making sure a company is well positioned in a growing
industry _ ``getting the fundamentals right,'' as McNamee puts it _
is probably the most valuable thing an investor can do when
committing money to a stock for a decade or more.
</P>
<P>
   And then, he said, ``you have to leave it to the market.''
</P>
<P>
   McNamee is comfortable with the fundamentals at Flextronics
International, another long-term Integral holding that is his top
pick as a keeper for the '00s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are Manufacturing Inc. for the technology world,'' he
said of Flextronics, which is based in Singapore. ``They are a
contract manufacturer with the most efficient supply train in the
industry. When you go to Cisco's Web site to order a router, it
goes to Flextronics. They have an exceptional management team and a
wonderful reputation of having totally changed the rules. They are
the Dell Computer of this decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Flextronics, which went public in 1994, had a total return of
more than 1,100 percent during the 1990s. Still, for an
Internet-related company, the stock is trading at a comparatively
modest 53 times this year's earnings. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Nasgovitz &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heartland Value Fund &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Henry Schein Inc. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nasgovitz, the president and founder of Heartland Advisors and
manager of its $1.1 billion Heartland Value fund, likes ferreting
out small, cheap stocks. With so many stocks under attack, he has a
big sampling of names to sift through these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love to bargain hunt,'' Nasgovitz said. ``That is what we
are all about.''
</P>
<P>
   His record of buying low and selling higher is not too shabby:
Over the last 10 years, Heartland Value has posted an average
annual return of 16.4 percent, Morningstar said.
</P>
<P>
   Nasgovitz accepted the assignment of choosing one stock to hold
until 2010 with a degree of reluctance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years is an awfully long time in this competitive market,
in this competitive world,'' he said. (At Heartland Value, the
turnover rate was a very low 4 percent a year during the 1990s,
according to Morningstar.)
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, he framed the issue by considering the needs of the
world's graying baby boomers. His buy-and-hold selection is Henry
Schein Inc., a global distributor of dental and health care
supplies whose stock he has been buying lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more and more dental care, not only in the U.S. but
worldwide,'' Nasgovitz explained. Yet the stock, which traded for
$53 in mid-1998, is now selling at about $13. ``It hasn't
participated in this rally at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nasgovitz figures that catering to the aging teeth in mouths all
over the world should increase Henry Schein's revenues by 15
percent a year through the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The company currently has annual sales of more than $2 billion.
``In 10 years, that means their top-line revenues should
quadruple,'' he said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Miller &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Legg Mason Value Trust Fund &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Waste Management &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Miller is not the stranger to technology that many value
managers are. America Online has long been one of the fund's
biggest holdings, helping Miller become that most sought-after
rarity: a fund manager whose $12.5 billion portfolio regularly
beats the market indexes.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, when asked to pick a stock to buy and hold for the
next decade, he chooses a business that is about as basic as they
get.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waste Management is a company with extremely low valuations
that is surrounded with a lot of pessimism,'' he said. ``But it has
a good business model and no Internet, currency or technological
risk. And it has only three major competitors. We think this is a
stock where you can make 5 times to 10 times your money in the next
10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that few competitors are out fighting Waste Management
to haul garbage is an important consideration when making a
long-term investment, Miller said. ``You want a business that is
relatively insulated from competition, where the barriers to
success are high,'' he said. ``It is very difficult to build a
dominant waste management company.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has a long way to go to regain respect on Wall
Street. After issuing profit warnings every month from July through
October, Waste Management named a new chief executive last
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look in places where valuations are low and at
businesses that have the possibility of earning high returns,''
Miller said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Liz Ann Sonders &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, Cowperthwait &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pick: JDS Uniphase &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because she just had her second child, a girl. But
Sonders does not quarrel with the notion that buying and holding a
stock for 10 years is a little like parenting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't all be great, and you have to be nurturing,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sonders is a managing director and a member of the investment
policy committee at Campbell, Cowperthwait, a money management firm
in New York that is a division of the United States Trust Co. The
firm, which manages $4.5 billion, mostly for high-net-worth
individuals, has an impressive track record; its gains last year
exceeded 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the appreciation is a result of big investments in
technology stocks, which now make up nearly 60 percent of the
firm's model portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it is fairly easy to suggest that technology will be
the area that will be the big winner'' over the next decade, she
said. ``In general, it is where you want to look for
opportunities.''

 UNDATED: for opportunities.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is also the space that JDS Uniphase, Sonders' top
buy-and-hold pick, occupies. The company, which makes fiber optic
products for telecommunications and cable television companies
worldwide, is one of the market's darlings, returning 984 percent
over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the marriage of a great company and great management
with great industry fundamentals,'' Sonders said. ``At a minimum,
the fiber optic component market is expected to quadruple in size
over the next three years. The only hindrance is that there is too
much demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the companies that compete in this market, JDS Uniphase ``has
the broadest product line,'' Sonders said. ``They are the dominant
player in terms of scale and size, and their earnings will grow at
a 50 percent annual rate over the next three to five years,'' she
said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Justin Thomson &QL;
</P>
<P>
   T. Rowe Price International &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Discovery Fund &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Zee Telefilms &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The notion of parking a stock in a portfolio for a decade is not
one that sits easily with Thomson, whose $1.1 billion fund rose a
hefty 155 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, most of the companies in which the fund invests
are small. More often than not, they get swallowed. Some get wiped
out. Few stay in his portfolio for an extended period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not Warren Buffett, so this is quite a high-risk strategy
for me,'' Thomson said by telephone from London. ``It's like
running naked.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the criteria for selecting a company worth holding for a
decade are pretty clear, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be in an area where the overall market is growing,
because it increases your chances of success,'' he said. ``And
companies in growing markets tend to have pricing power.''
</P>
<P>
   Zee Telefilms, an Indian film and television company, is the
stock Thomson said he would buy and hold until 2010, despite his
squeamishness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over a decade, this is one of the best ways to play India as a
consumer force,'' he said. ``They will be the major beneficiary of
advertising spent in that market, and they are well positioned in
all sorts of areas, including the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   A conglomerate that owns free and subscriber channels as well as
a cable operation and an entertainment division, Zee was an
extraordinary performer last year, posting a gain of more than
1,800 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Zee Telefilms does not trade in this country. Only 30
percent of its outstanding shares are available to foreigners.
Because of various securities laws, the only way to obtain them is
through a mutual fund like Thomson's.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have an American depository receipt yet, but I
would not rule that out,'' Thomson said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Robert E. Turner &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Turner Investment Partners &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Cisco Systems &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Turner, whose firm manages money for institutions and mutual
fund investors, isn't a traditional buy-and-hold kind of money
manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``We buy companies where earnings will exceed expectations and
sell them where earnings are going to miss expectations,'' said
Turner, chairman and chief investment officer of Turner Investment,
based in Berwyn, Pa. ``We tend to buy and own stocks that are
making new highs versus new lows. But we also pride ourselves on
fundamental analysis.'' His Turner Equity Growth fund, founded late
in 1993, posted an average annual return of 23.7 percent in the
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of the $6 billion that the firm has under
management is in technology stocks. And Cisco Systems is at the top
of his list for the new decade.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's stock was a strong performer of the 1990s. Turner knows
that a second decade of gains that are remotely akin to those would
be astounding, and unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next 10 years they many not have the highest
appreciation, but in terms of pure risk/reward, Cisco is the stock
I feel most comfortable with,'' he said. ``They understand where
the marketplace is going and are making sure they are going to be a
leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, Cisco has made 50 acquisitions in areas relevant to
its business, Turner noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shows to me they are paying attention to where the market
is going,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (His other favorite? Internet Capital Group, the holding company
that manages and operates a stable of Net companies.)  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Wanger &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wanger buys and holds stocks. His $4 billion Acorn Fund has low
annual turnover _ about 30 percent. The stocks he selects have not
done badly, either. Over the last decade, the fund had an annual
average rate of return of more than 17 percent, versus 14.93
percent for the Lipper small-cap funds index.
</P>
<P>
   He is a man of few words but clear ideas about the kind of stock
he would want to hold for 10 years: ``Stocks with a terrific brand
name in an industry that was likely to be popular for a very long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   To make the cut, ``growth is obviously important, and so is
management,'' he said. ``Some technology companies have higher
growth rates than the stocks I like, but the idea those growth
rates will persist for 10 years is unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, ``if you are looking to hold a stock for 10 years,
you have to assume that many of the people that are in current
management won't be there in 10 years,'' he added. ``You can't bet
on a genius unless the genius is young.''
</P>
<P>
   With those things in mind, Wanger said his top long-term choice
is Jones Apparel Group of Bristol, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a well-run company,'' he said. Plus, ``I think women will
be wearing clothing 10 years from now, and Jones Apparel will be
making their fair share of those clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   A report showing that Berkshire Hathaway owned slightly more
than 12 million Jones New York shares at the end of last year
didn't bother Wanger a bit. Nor do questions that have circulated
recently about the company's management tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffett understands value, and there is value and growth in a
company like Jones,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wanger said he was not aware of any serious matters relating to
Jones Apparel management. But he would not be overly concerned if
he had heard them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management changes will happen over the next 10 years, no
matter what the company is,'' he said. &QL;

DEFENSE IN SOCIALITE'S MURDER ATTACKS INVESTIGATION AND CARETAKER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lawyers for the mother and son accused of murdering
an Upper East Side woman cross-examined the woman's longtime
caretaker Friday, asking about his access to the woman's bank
accounts and suggesting that the police did not adequately consider
the possibility of other suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The mother and son, Sante and Kenneth Kimes, are on trial in
state Supreme Court in Manhattan, accused of murdering Kimes'
landlord, Irene Silverman, as part of a complex plan to steal her
mansion.
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyers asked the caretaker, Mengistu Melesse, who
had worked six years for Silverman, if the police had questioned
his friends or challenged his statement that he had been in Atlanta
watching an Ethiopian soccer tournament the week before Silverman's
disappearance on July 5, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions about his access to Silverman's bank
accounts, Melesse testified that he regularly cashed checks for his
employer.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he did not know if the police had questioned his
friends and said he had not been asked by the police to produce bus
or plane tickets in connection with his trip.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of court, Jose Muniz, a lawyer for Sante Kimes, said
that the police never properly investigated others, including
Melesse, his friends and fellow employees. Muniz said he thought it
was curious that Melesse, who worked as a deliveryman before being
hired by Silverman, never took a vacation until the week before she
disappeared. And he added that with his access to her money, the
82-year-old woman could have presented a tempting target.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should have been a suspect,'' Muniz said. ``He's a
legitimate suspect. How does a delivery guy become her right-hand
man?'' Investigators have said that they interviewed dozens of
people after Silverman's disappearance but quickly found evidence
implicating the Kimeses.
</P>
<P>
   Melesse's three days of testimony provided evidence that could
be damaging to the defense. He testified that Silverman never left
the house unaccompanied, would never have willingly given up the
house and never gave out her keys.
</P>
<P>
   Although Silverman's body has never been found, Kimes had her
keys when the police arrested him, and a forged deed transferring
the house to Kimes was found in a suitcase belonging to the
Kimeses, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   In courtroom questioning, Muniz tried to suggest to the jury
that Melesse was embellishing his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Melesse testified that Silverman had drawn a
picture of Kimes about a week before she disappeared saying, ``This
is for evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Muniz asked Melesse why he had never mentioned that comment to
the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   His voice rising, Melesse said that his testimony Thursday was
more complete than his earlier statement. ``I think about this case
every day, every day, so I can give the truth,'' he said.

 ANALYSIS: BUSH'S MESSAGE HAS CHANGED AS McCAIN'S CHALLENGE HAS(EDS: Second half of 4th graf rewritten; more complete quote in

 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas began his quest
for the presidency in a blaze of promises and good intentions,
carrying an emphatically articulated vision of the new image he
planned to establish for the Republican party and the new voters he
intended to woo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a uniter, not a divider,'' Bush said as he began a
nine-month trek to this critical juncture, and he repeated that
mantra each and every step of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Bush sang another melodious tune, too: that his campaign would
hit an indefatigably upbeat, positive note and lift people's
spirits, always making them proud. Party elders beamed, because
here, at long last, was a vibrant, youthful Republican presidential
candidate who could court voters across a wide range of the
political spectrum and match any Democrat in the sensitivity wars.
</P>
<P>
   But the trail took a twist here in South Carolina, a state that
has long smiled on traditional Republicans, and in the final weeks
leading up to Saturday's fiercely contested primary, Bush
frequently seemed harsh, acerbic and as deeply invested in the
status quo of Republican politics as his father or Bob Dole, the
party's nominees from the last three elections.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Sen. John McCain of Arizona humbled Bush with a
19-point victory in New Hampshire, Bush has been on the attack,
hammering away at McCain's record day after day, in news
conferences and radio and television commercials. And through much
of the time, McCain unleashed several blistering attacks of his
own.
</P>
<P>
   Bush simultaneously pursued a well-trod path of political
caution, announcing unequivocally that he would shore up the
conservative Republican base in South Carolina on the same day
earlier this month that he visited Bob Jones University, a
Christian school with a controversial and well-known policy
prohibiting interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
   And, over the last few days, Bush intermittently portrayed the
election here as a contest between the Republicans who favored him
and the independents and Democrats who wanted to throw a wrench
into the process by siding with McCain.
</P>
<P>
   It was a cunning method for turning out the Republican vote, but
it cast Democrats as enemies and provided a vivid reminder that
somewhere along the way, McCain had commandeered the perception of
being the Republican able to sow support in unlikely places.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, in the end, Bush's strategy will yield him a victory
here. But at what price?
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday, a reporter edged up to this
question, but Bush confidently dismissed any concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the beginnings of a long marathon,'' Bush said.
``We'll find out who can attract votes of independents and
Democrats in the long run,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, asked about McCain's stated desire to reinvent
the Republican party, Bush said, ``Reinvent it? I want to lead it
to victory. I want to be the person we nominate.''
</P>
<P>
   To a large extent, what happened to Bush in South Carolina was
the inevitable and unremarkable product of an extraordinarily tight
race. Like any candidate in a vigorous fight, he reached out to his
most reliable supporters, and he took on his opponent as directly
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   He and his advisers rejected the notion that their engagement of
McCain has been negative, saying that Bush simply responded to what
they viewed to as lines of argument by McCain that were unwarranted
and extreme. They cited, in particular, two television commercials
in which McCain compared Bush's trustworthiness to that of
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt compelled to defend his integrity,'' said Karen P.
Hughes, the campaign's director of communications.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Bush did not abandon the oratory he had used to date,
and he frequently touted accomplishments and ideals that were not
necessarily tailored to conservative voters' strongest interests.
</P>
<P>
   He almost never talked about the importance of improving
education without noting the particular strides that he said
Hispanic and black students in Texas had made.
</P>
<P>
   He answered every question he received about illegal
immigration, a source of intense vexation for many South
Carolinians, by reminding voters that many Mexicans streamed into
the United States simply to seek a better life for their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family values do not stop at the Rio Grande,'' he said during
perhaps a dozen question-and-answer sessions with voters here over
the last two and a half weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But that compassionate message was frequently eclipsed in the
public eye by seemingly contradictory signals that Bush might not
be willing to press his case to the point where it cost him any
votes on the right.
</P>
<P>
   It was not simply that Bush repeatedly declined to express
either approval of disapproval of the flying of the Confederate
battle flag over the South Carolina state capitol, even when Tim
Russert, interviewing him Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press,''
challenged him by saying: ``Lead!''
</P>
<P>
   It was that Bush met fresh questions about the flag with a
stern, displeased expression. And his answers seldom included pleas
for racial tolerance and healing.
</P>
<P>
   The visit to Bob Jones University fell into a similar category,
and it drew intense attention from news organizations that has yet
to let up.
</P>
<P>
   When it predictably came up at the Republican debate on Tuesday,
Bush argued that he had denounced the dating policy, making it
sound as if he had done so in his remarks at the school. In truth,
that stand was taken at a subsequent news conference miles away
from Bob Jones University, and only after a reporter questioned him
intently.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference this week, Bush answered a question about
whether his appearance at the university would hurt him in a
general election by saying that both his father, George Bush, and
Ronald Reagan had visited the school without electoral
repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Republican of the future leaned on logic and
examples from the past.
</P>
<P>
   That was also the case in some of his final appeals to
Republicans on the last day before the South Carolina primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow,'' he told an audience in Clinton this morning,
``South Carolina can send a strong message of what our party stands
for.''
</P>
<P>
   His next words boiled that position down to two core thoughts,
neither of which spoke to his initial rallying cry of compassionate
conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``A limited government,'' Bush promised, ``and lower taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Those pledges drew vigorous applause. Then again, they would
have elicited the same reaction 10 or 20 years ago.

   LONG-ISLAND-FILMS (New York) _ For me _ a fanatical filmgoer
from an early age _ the real proof that Long Island was nowhere was
that I never saw it in the movies. It obviously wasn't important in
the way New York, London, Paris and Dodge City were. The lonely
exception to the silver screen's general embargo on images of Long
Island was that sequence in ``North by Northwest'' in which the
urbane Cary Grant was kidnapped outside the Plaza Hotel and taken
to a mansion on the North Shore, where he would barely survive an
attempt on his life. All this would change, though, in part thanks
to the rise of independent film, with its fondness for depicting
quirky people in ordinary settings (or, perhaps more to the point,
in cheap locations). By Terrence Rafferty. (Moved). &QL;

   NY-ART-DIRECTORS (Undated) _ A talk between two of the most

   BEACH-FILM (Undated) _ In ``The Beach,'' Danny Boyle's film
adaptation of Alex Garland's popular novel, Leonardo DiCaprio is
Richard, a pleasure-seeking backpacker who finds himself alone and
itching for adventure in swinging Bangkok. Richard's vague search
for heaven on earth (with some requisite danger thrown in) leads
him to a secret commune on a remote coastal island that can be
reached only by swimming to its shores. At first, paradise appears
to be everything he has been looking for. Against a backdrop of
perfect sunsets and moonrises, its international brigade of
post-hippie sybarites (so preposterously well-tended that they
resemble the cast of ``Baywatch'' on a Club Med holiday) while away
their days in peppy beachside games of soccer and volleyball.
Utopia only begins to pall after a tragedy reveals Richard's fellow
exiles to be a bunch of selfish party animals willing to sacrifice
lives to keep their pristine enclave a secret. By Stephen Holden.

   MIFUNE-FILM (Copenhagen, Denmark) _ ``Mifune,'' is a touching
love story set on an isolated farm in southern Denmark. The film,
by the Danish diredtor, Soren Kragy-Jacobsen, 52, which won a
special jury prize at the 1999 Berlin film festival and is
Denmark's Academy Award nominee for best foreign language film this

   WASHINGTON-BALLET-SCHOOL (Washington) _ It was once a private
home, but now the four-floor white building at the intersection of
Wisconsin Avenue and Porter Street is filled with studios, offices
and dressing rooms. In a way it is still a home, but now to the
Washington School of Ballet, founded in 1944 by Mary Day and Lisa
Gardiner, and the Washington Ballet, founded by Day in 1976. In the
1980s, Choo San Goh, who was the resident choreographer,
transformed the company from a regional ballet troupe into an
internationally respected entity. Goh died in 1987, and after
several successors had come and gone, the company appointed its
present artistic director, Septime Webre, last June. By Kate
Mattingly. (Moved).  &QL;

   JULIO-BOCCO-DANCE (New York) _ Julio Bocca, a dashing star of
American Ballet Theater, did not look himself as he rehearsed in a
mid-Manhattan studio early this month. With his toes turned in, his
back arched and his hands placed on his hips, not a trace of
Albrecht or Romeo could be discerned in his demeanor. While still
jet-lagged from a flight from Buenos Aires and worn from rehearsing
his own company, Ballet Argentina, for its recent performance at
the World Financial Center Winter Garden, he was trying to absorb a
choreographic style as different from Petipa as night from day. And
he had to learn it fast, because last Tuesday he was to make his
Broadway debut in the Tony Award-winning musical ``Fosse.'' By

Nicholas Martin, opened to raves in September at the Vineyard

   CARUSO-2000-MUSIC (Undated) _ Have you ever wondered what it
would be like to hear your favorite Caruso recordings freshened up:
say, with the great tenor's voice, exactly as it was captured by an
acoustic recording horn in the days before microphones, newly
cloaked in the lush timbres of a modern symphony orchestra recorded
in digital stereo? No, of course you haven't. Why would you? Why
would anyone? Yet someone not only did but also suspected that
other people might. Thus we have ``Caruso 2000,'' a production of

   CLASSIC-LYRICS (Undated) _ Composing lyrics in the classic
tradition of American song has always demanded a respect for, if
not slavish adherence to, laws: of form, function, poesy. That's
the fun of it. The challenge. The ideal. We live, however, in the
grip of a music culture that venerates rebelliousness. The
intricacies of lyric writing have thus been reduced to brute
effusion. Worse than a chore, adherence to craft is actually seen
as a sellout. By Barry Singer. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GRAMMY-AWARDS (Undated) _ Yet another chapter in pop's latest
bout with adolescence unfolds this week at the 42nd annual Grammy
Awards. The nominee list, as undependable as ever in predicting
music's real history-makers, does crackle with one present
conflict, between the parent figures who run the event and the kids
now paying their allowances. Those kids get on adults' nerves with
their obvious commercial music, but these hit makers, sometimes
unwittingly, are pointing toward pop's future. A likely sweep by
the night's deserving front-runner, Carlos Santana, will reassure
those baby-boomer voters far too old to really understand the
chart-topping teenage nominees like Britney Spears, Christina
Aguilera and those ever-present, thrice-nominated Backstreet Boys.

   ED-LOGUE-ARCHITECT (New York) _ For many New Yorkers, Ed Logue's
name evokes an era when the quality of urban life was measured by
something more than skyrocketing real estate prices, the banishment
of homeless people from public sidewalks and the glitter of
confetti falling from the sky. The ideal of social equality also
figured in the equation. Logue, born in Philadelphia in 1921, was
among the last of the master planners to practice urban renewal on
an epic scale. By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL;

   CREWDSON-PHOTOGS (Lee, Mass.) _ Chaos may lie behind Gregory
Crewdson's work, but you would hardly know it from looking at his
pictures of suburbia, where an eerie calm always prevails. Since
1998, the 37-year-old photographer has been creating a series
titled ``Twilight,'' which now includes 20 meticulously detailed,
richly colored pictures, all taken in and around the outskirts of
Lee, ranging from domestic interiors to landscape views. The
photographs, featuring the local townspeople, are always shot at
dusk. Twelve of Crewdson's most recent ``Twilight'' photographs are
now on view at Luhring Augustine Gallery. By Elizabeth Hayt.

   TV-TALK-WALLS (Undated) _ Three years after they became the most
publicized, criticized, scrutinized gay couple in Hollywood, if not
the country, Ellen DeGeneres and Anne Heche have had enough. Not of
each other. Far from it. They have a new outlook and are eager to
declare, despite predictions that theirs was a relationship founded
on Hollywood-style eccentricity and star madness, that they are
still, as Ms. Heche put it, ``crazy happy'' together. As recently
as last July, when Ms. Heche and Ms. DeGeneres sat down for an
interview in their trailer on the set of ``If These Walls Could
Talk 2,'' the HBO film in which both women have had a prominent
hand, they were still anguished over the lack of enthusiasm their
pairing up had inspired. By Bill Carter. (Moved). &QL;

MANY HOT NAMES OF THE PAST HAVE VANISHED  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 20)

<P>
   ``Past performance is no guarantee of future success'' just
might be one of the most useful phrases ever uttered on Wall
Street. For confirmation, one need only peruse these lists of the
best-performing stocks of the past four decades.
</P>
<P>
   (Before leaping from your chair in indignation about the names
included or excluded, a word about methodology: only companies that
were public for the entire 10 years of each decade qualified, so
Internet stocks didn't. And stocks trading at $5 or less at the
beginning of the decade were ruled out.)
</P>
<P>
   For starters, consider how many of these companies no longer
exist as stand-alone businesses. Burroughs and Dr Pepper, two hot
stocks of the 1960s, were swallowed. Parker Pen was too _ only now
Gillette, the current owner, is exploring ways to unload the
flagging business.
</P>
<P>
   And during the 1990s the roar of the Dreyfus lion was muffled in
the maw of the Mellon Financial Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Or think about the fate of NVF, the best performing stock of the
1970s. In the ensuing decade and junk bonds, NVF was controlled by
Victor Posner, one of the biggest junk bond aficionados of the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Things didn't work out so well for Posner, or for his plastics
products company. In May 1986, the New York Stock Exchange
suspended trading in NVF shares. Ultimately, Posner was barred from
heading a public company.
</P>
<P>
   But there are positive stories here, too, about brands with
lasting value. Tandy and the Gap are still going strong. Scientific
Atlanta, one of the best performers of the 1970s, is seen by many
as a key player, with its cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most striking numbers in these charts are the gains
of the best performers of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The gains posted by NBTY, a maker of nutritional supplements _ a
bit over 7,800 percent _ were more than three times those recorded
by Delta Air Lines and NVF in topping the charts for the 1960s and
1970s, respectively. But NBTY barely made the top 10 for the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction between the 1990s and the previous 30 years
would have been even sharper if the criteria had been relaxed a
bit.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems and JDS Uniphase, two stocks recommended as holds
for the '00s, went public after Dec. 31, 1989. Cisco, which missed
the deadline by a couple of months, rose 69,000 percent in the
1990s; JDS Uniphase shares have appreciated more than 31,000
percent since their public offering in November 1993.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Over the last few years, as the American Museum of
Natural History put up its sleek new planetarium on the Upper West
Side, its enormous sphere and glass walls were erected around one
of the museum's oldest treasures, a great 15-ton meteorite that
fell to Earth 10,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For almost a century, the Willamette Meteorite _ a behemoth
believed to have come from the Asteroid Belt between Mars and
Jupiter and brought to the museum from the Pacific Northwest in
1906 _ has been seen and touched by generations of awed school
children and other aficionados of the cosmic mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   But as the $210 million Rose Center for Earth and Space opens at
81st Street near Central Park West on Saturday to crowds that are
expected to swell to 4.5 million visitors a year, the destiny of
the dark, deeply gouged meteorite, seemingly secure on its steel
pedestal in the planetarium's Cullman Hall of the Universe, has
been cast into doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Acting under a federal law written for the preservation and
repatriation of Native American cultural and religious artifacts,
an Indian group in Oregon has submitted a claim for the meteorite,
saying it was a holy tribal object that brought messages from the
spirit world long before the arrival of white men.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sacred object to the people of the Willamette
Valley,'' Tracy Dugan, speaking for the Confederated Tribes of the
Grand Ronde of Oregon, said Friday. ``It was used by our ancestors.
We want to bring it back here to our reservation and make it
available for people to use in the traditional way.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum has until Feb. 29 to respond to the claim, which was
filed last Nov. 30 under the Native American Graves Protection and
Repatriation Act of 1990. The case could wind up in court and take
years to resolve, but if no settlement is reached and the claim is
eventually upheld, it would be necessary to partly dismantle the
new planetarium to get it out.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the planetarium's widely-publicized opening,
museum officials were focused not on the meteorite but on smoothing
the way for up to 18,000 visitors on Saturday, the vanguard of
crowds expected in the weeks and months ahead. Already, 100,000
advance tickets for the tour-of-the-virtual-universe shows have
been sold, although tickets for half of the seats are to be held
back for sale at the museum for each of the 14 to 20 daily
performances.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Canty, a spokeswoman for the museum, declined to comment
Friday on the claim for the meteorite. But she acknowledged that
removing it from its new home would be difficult. ``Because the
meteorite is so massive, parts of the facility had to essentially
be built around it,'' she noted.
</P>
<P>
   The Willamette Meteorite, a mass of metal and rock the size of a
small car, is thought to have plunged down in flames somewhere in
the Pacific Northwest 10 millennia ago, a gnarled monster from
space. Shifted by an Ice Age glacier, it came to rest on a hillside
in West Linn, Ore., just south of Portland.
</P>
<P>
   There, the Clackamas tribe _ one of many groups now part of the
Grand Ronde confederation _ took it to be a sacred representation
of sky, earth and water, and adopted it. They called it
``Tomanoas,'' according to Dugan. Rain water collected in its
craters was considered holy, and Clackamas youths were sent on
vigils to the meteorite to receive messages from the spirit world.
</P>
<P>
   In 1902, Ellis G. Hughes, a miner and farmer, discovered it on
land owned by an iron company and had it moved to his barn. He
began charging visitors 25 cents to see it. In 1905, the iron
company sued for its return and repossessed the meteorite, which
had become a local attraction.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, a visitor from New York, Mrs. William Dodge,
bought the meteorite for $20,600 and donated it to the American
Museum of Natural History. It was moved to New York and became part
of the museum's permanent collection. In 1935, when the Hayden
Planetarium opened, it became a centerpiece of its exhibit and over
the years was seen and touched by millions.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, when the museum began work on the Rose Center to
replace the old planetarium, a decision was made to incorporate a
few of the old treasures _including the meteorite and scales
showing what a person would weigh on the moon and various planets _
into the new building.
</P>
<P>
   The meteorite was so large and heavy that it had to be installed
first, in effect, and the planetarium built around it. Two years
ago, contractors sunk three steel pilings into the ground to
support its bulk, and it was swung in on a crane and mounted in a
permanent exhibition hall on the lower level.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, with the planetarium still under construction, a
half-dozen representatives of the Grand Ronde confederation visited
museums in Chicago, Boston and other cities in the East, including
the American Museum of Natural History, in search of cultural and
religious artifacts that they might have a right to claim.
</P>
<P>
   The confederation has a reservation and headquarters in Grand
Ronde, Ore., 60 miles west of Portland, and 4,500 members in five
main tribes, situated in the Willamette Valley, which stretches
south from Portland about 100 miles. The Clackamas tribe is a
subgroup of one of the five main tribes, Dugan said.
</P>
<P>
   As is true of many Native American groups, its chances of
recovering lost cultural and religious artifacts seemed hopeless
years ago, especially after many of the smaller tribes were
officially ``terminated'' by the federal government in 1954, under
an Eisenhower administration policy aimed at greater assimilation
of Indians into American culture.
</P>
<P>
   But after years of lobbying, many of the groups, including the
Grand Ronde, were officially resurrected in 1983, and in 1990 the
Native American Graves and Repatriation Act gave new hope to tribes
seeking to recover objects, including bones of ancestors and
relics, that had been sacred or culturally important.
</P>
<P>
   Under a federal grant, the delegation from Grand Ronde _ Ryan
and Adrienne Heavy Head, June Olson, Lindy Trolan and others _
visited the Natural History Museum in New York over a period of six
days, taking thousands of pictures to document objects for possible
repatriation.
</P>
<P>
   Dugan said the group was treated civilly, but encountered
resistance from museum officials when they sought to take pictures
of the Willamette Meteorite. It was in a hard-hat construction
area, they were told. But they were eventually allowed in under
supervision and took pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving the museum, the delegation filed the claim
directly with the museum on behalf of the Grand Ronde, Dugan said.
Documentary evidence to support the claim was filed with the museum
on Nov. 30, she said. Under the federal law, the museum is obliged
to respond within 90 days, which she said would elapse on Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Proof of ownership appears to be the critical issue _ the
museum's citing its acquisition of and long protective association
with the meteorite, versus the Grand Ronde's claim of ancient
tribal religious and cultural ties. The case could go to a federal
review committee or to court, and it could take years to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Or the two sides could agree to settle it, although Dugan
suggested that that was doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of Indian culture has been lost,'' she said. ``Our
people were discouraged, even forbidden, to practice their
religion. We want the meteorite back, and not some settlement.''

   When 18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger died last September in a gene
therapy experiment that went awry, shares of Cell Genesys Inc., a
gene therapy company, were selling for about $8. Now they are
selling for more than $30. Avigen Inc., another gene therapy
company, has zoomed from about $11 to $66. And Targeted Genetics
has increased tenfold from less than $2 to more than $20.
</P>
<P>
   Gelsinger's death has cast a harsh spotlight on gene therapy,
raising questions about whether patient safeguards were neglected
in the quest for profits. The result could be tighter regulations
or even, in the worst case for the industry, a public backlash
similar to what is starting to occur against genetically modified
foods.
</P>
<P>
   But investors hardly seem to care. Shares of virtually all
companies involved in gene therapy have climbed sharply since the
controversy arose. Wall Street seems to be betting that the
repercussions will be confined to the University of Pennsylvania,
where Gelsinger was treated, and to the particular technology used
in his case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people have really focused on it, to be
honest,'' Meg Malloy, an analyst with Chase H&AMP; Q, said of the
controversy. ``I don't think it will create serious barriers. I do
think it will slow things down for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at several gene therapy companies said that while
they are keeping a wary eye on Washington, the controversy has not
affected their companies. ``We're really not influenced by what's
going on at this time,'' said Stephen A. Sherwin, chairman and
chief executive of Cell Genesys.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the rise in gene therapy stocks is the investor frenzy
for all of biotechnology, which is suddenly being viewed as the
next big thing after the Internet. The Nasdaq biotechnology index
has doubled since the end of September. ``We have a halo effect
around biotech right now,'' said Kurt von Emster, portfolio manager
of the Franklin Biotechnology Discovery Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest stocks have been those of companies involved in
deciphering the human genetic code. Gene therapy has basked in the
fringes of this glow because once disease-causing genes are found,
there will be more opportunities to inject corrective genes into
people as therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Even if there were no controversy, the current investor
enthusiasm for gene therapy would be surprising. Gene therapy has
been the black sheep of the biotechnology industry because it
hasn't really cured anyone in more than 300 clinical trials over 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   But now there are glimmers of progress. Avigen reported recently
that gene therapy tested on three people with hemophilia had
reduced the amount of blood-clotting drugs they had to take.
Avigen, based in Alameda, Calif., is planning to sell more stock to
the public, a sign that it is not overly concerned about events in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy has swirled around whether University of
Pennsylvania scientists fully informed Gelsinger, who suffered from
a rare hereditary disease, about the risks of the treatment. Safety
questions have focused on the adenovirus, a weakened cold virus,
that was used to carry the genes into Gelsinger's liver.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few other clinical trials seem to have been directly
affected so far. The Food and Drug Administration temporarily
suspended enrollment of new patients into two gene therapy trials
for liver cancer run by the Schering-Plough Corp. that used an
approach similar to the Penn study. But that suspension was lifted
in December. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston earlier
this month halted a hemophilia trial financed by Transkaryotic
Therapies Inc. because of the controversy, even though the trial
was not using adenoviruses. That trial is resuming also.
</P>
<P>
   But Schering-Plough is such a big company that the delay of two
trials would have little effect on its stock. Transkaryotic
Therapies is a small, publicly traded company, but gene therapy is
not its main attraction for investors. Other companies using
adenovirus, such as Genovo and Genvec, are privately held.
</P>
<P>
   The one public gene therapy company that does inject
adenoviruses into patients is Collateral Therapeutics of San Diego,
which is using gene therapy to try to grow blood vessels as an
alternative to bypass surgery in treating heart disease.
Collateral's stock has been erratic and has risen from $17 at the
end of September to $33 now, a smaller rise than the other gene
therapy stocks.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokeswoman said the controversy has had no effect on
Collateral.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Targeted Genetics, Vical Inc. and Avigen, do not use the
adenovirus and have managed to distance themselves from the
controversy. To some extent the current controversy has vindicated
their choice of technologies. ``They have in a funny sort of way
benefited,'' said James McCamant, publisher of the Medical
Technology Stock Letter.
</P>
<P>
   Vical Inc., based in San Diego, injects genes without putting
them into any kind of virus. When the company met with investors
last month prior to issuing new shares to the public, it was
peppered with questions about the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept telling them, `Can you spell nonviral?''' said Alain B.
Schreiber, president and chief executive. Vical ended up raising
$125 million, twice as much as it expected.
</P>
<P>
   Targeted Genetics and Avigen use adeno-associated viruses,
which, despite their name, are not related to adenoviruses. Cell
Genesys does use adenovirus in efforts to treat lung cancer but it
injects the viruses into tumor cells outside the body, which the
company says is a safer technique. Cell Genesys shares have been
driven up by the mushrooming in value of its minority stake in
Abgenix, a biotechnology company not involved in gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while investors seem to be drawing a distinction between
the different techniques of gene therapy, regulators, politicians
and the general public might not. There is already talk of
expanding the investigation to trials that used other techniques
aside from adenoviruses. And new regulations might cover all gene
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is the overall general public perception that gene
therapy is dangerous,'' said H. Stewart Parker, president and chief
executive of Targeted Genetics, based in Seattle. ``Have we created
the situation where people are going to be afraid to enter into
gene therapy trials?''

NCAA INVESTIGATES PREP SCHOOL TUITION OF ST. JOHN'S BARKLEY

   NEW YORK _ An investigator from the National Collegiate Athletic
Association has spoken with officials at a Maine prep school about
whether people associated with the Riverside Church basketball
program, or other benefactors, paid part of Erick Barkley's tuition
when the St. John's guard attended the school in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Cummings, headmaster of the Maine Central Institute, said
that the school does not give out full scholarships and that every
student is responsible for at least part of the $23,500 tuition.
Cummings said an investigator had spoken to the school's admissions
and financial aid officers by phone about who paid Barkley's
tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Much like a college, Cummings said, the school tries to assess a
family's ability to pay and comes up with a reasonable portion of
the tuition that a student and his family will be responsible for.
He said the school, which is in Pittsfield, Maine, , offers
financial aid, but does not award full athletic scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings would not reveal how much of his tuition Barkley was
charged, or who paid it. He acknowledged, however, that benefactors
have provided the balance of tuition for some students, and that in
the past some benefactors have been connected with Riverside
Church.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Lorch, a Manhattan lawyer who has helped build Riverside's
basketball program, said Friday that he had provided financial
assistance to hundreds of players in his 40 years with the program.
In fact, at the funeral of the former St. John's star Reggie Carter
in December, Lorch told a reporter that he had helped put Carter
through prep school at Long Island Lutheran.
</P>
<P>
   Lorch declined Friday to say whether he paid part of Barkley's
tuition at Maine Central Institute. He said he had not been
contacted by the NCAA about Barkley, who played for the Riverside
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not commenting about particular players at this time,''
Lorch said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA contact with Maine Central Institute suggests that
investigators are following a similar path to other inquiries that
have resulted in several suspensions of college basketball players
in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, another former Maine Central Institute player _ Andre
Williams of Oklahoma State _ was declared ineligible for a year and
ordered to pay $20,000 when the NCAA discovered that his tuition in
Maine had been paid by a Kansas City, Mo., businessman, Tom Grant.
Oklahoma State appealed the decision to the NCAA student-athlete
reinstatement committee, which reduced Williams' suspension last
month to five games and ordered him to pay $5,000 to charity over a
four-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Like Lorch, Grant is involved with a high-profile, traveling
summer basketball team, which he finances through a family
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   In Williams' case, the NCAA said the arrangement violated NCAA
bylaw 12.1.1.1.6, which is labeled, ``preferential treatment,
benefits or services.'' It bans ``preferential treatment, benefits
or services because of the individual's athletics reputation or
skill or pay-back potential as a professional athlete, unless such
treatment, benefits or services are specifically permitted under
NCAA legislation.'' &QL;

LACK OF WIND PUTS OFF AMERICA'S CUP OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to update. Top 2 grafs are new. Change at beginning of graf 3

<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ After a long week in which tongues, not
sails, were the main things flapping in the breeze, the time for
talking appeared to be over. The first race in the
five-of-nine-race America's Cup finals between the local heroes,
Team New Zealand, and the pride of Italy, the Prada Challenge, was
scheduled to begin Saturday, but there was barely a breath of air.
</P>
<P>
   Under a blazing sun, the crews waited 90 minutes before the race
was postponed to Sunday. The breeze was just 2 knots at the
scheduled start, and light winds are forecast for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As in most of the 29 that have preceded this one, a touch of
controversy has been floating in the air. But it has been
overshadowed by the probing chatter concerning the one and only
question that truly matters: Who is bringing the faster ride?
</P>
<P>
   The primary bone of contention regarded two proposed additions
to the sailing rules by the cup's current minders, the Royal New
Zealand Yacht Squadron. The Kiwis wished to place an official
observer aboard the boats who would work in concert with the
on-water umpires to make rulings in tight situations. They also
wanted all penalty turns to be executed immediately after a foul, a
change from the challengers' trials when boats were free to
exonerate themselves in most situations at any time during the
course of the race.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians took umbrage to both suggestions, the first on the
grounds that the English-speaking observers would be making calls
in what for many crewmen is their second language, and the second
because in a pre-start situation they felt that the penalty-turn
burden would unfairly affect the outcome of the race. In a
match-race, spotting the opposition an early lead makes a huge and
often fatal difference. And it may well have given the aggressive
New Zealand helmsman Russell Coutts an important edge.
</P>
<P>
   Prada filed a formal request to the cup's International
Arbitration Panel to rule on the dispute. But the larger matter
became moot when a mediator negotiated a compromise between the
camps, and the instigation of immediate penalty turns was
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The observer problem took care of itself when the designated
judges simply refused to board the boats _ they had been delegated
to a spot on the transom under the boat's antennas and other
electronics, and feared the possible exposure to radiation. ``They
had a nice seat, too, right in an electric chair,'' said Prada's
tactician Torben Grael.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of a potentially larger, less toxic issue has yet to
be resolved. In the challengers' trials, no race was started when
winds blew consistently above 18 knots. No lower wind range was
established, but the race committee regularly began races in
breezes below 10 knots.
</P>
<P>
   It has been thought that the Kiwis would relish sailing in
fresher winds, a fact confirmed by the principal race officer
Harold Bennett. But regarding the matter of light-air racing, which
many believe would favor Prada, he remained non-committal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In winds of 7 or 8 knots the conditions can  shifty and
unstable, and I doubt we'd want to start a race,'' he said. ``At
the top end, if we have 25 knots of southwest wind and flat water,
those are good conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Prada's designer, Doug Peterson, stirred the pot all week,
telling anyone within listening distance that he believed NZL 60,
the Kiwi boat, was riddled with speed-sapping flaws, particularly a
ballast bulb with wing in its center, not aft.
</P>
<P>
   Though Coutts has maintained an incredibly low profile for the
last several weeks, he finally spoke about Peterson's comments at a
Friday press conference, calling the Prada designer's opinion
``disconcerting.'' Coutts added, ``Everyone thinks what we've
chosen is so wrong. I guess we'll have to wait and see whether it
is or not.`
</P>
<P>
   Coutts was less diplomatic when an Italian journalist asked him
why he had skipped a mid-week reception for both crews, and about
reported riffs between the sailors and the administrators behind
the gates of the Kiwi compound. ``I think that's a ridiculous
question,'' he snapped. ``Let's move on.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is impossible to discern the general mood of the New
Zealand sailors, who have gone about the business of preparation in
a secluded, businesslike manner. Those wondering if the Kiwis are
feeling the pressure of their first defense have nothing to go on
but idle speculation.
</P>
<P>
   As for Prada, Rod Davis, the American-born head coach, believes
his crew is ready for whatever lies ahead. ``If there's anything
I've learned about the Italian style, it's that it's understated,''
he said. ``But these guys have proven again and again that they're
a tough bunch. I guarantee that, whatever happens, they won't fall
apart.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no more to be said. The next important sound will be
the starting gun.

Congressional Quarterly and National Journal; a speechwriter for

BIZ-COLLEGE-CREDITCARDS -- As it continues to wrap America in
plastic, the credit card industry is turning more aggressively to
college students and young adults. Despite students' limited
incomes and lack of credit history, the market is a gold mine for
card marketers: Students are eager to establish credit records and
financial independence - and to spend money on clothes, electronics
and cars. (The New York Times)

and Charles Horman just before they left for Chile, where he was
killed after a 1973 coup. Recently released documents make clear
for the first time that the State Department concluded from almost
the beginning that the Pinochet government had killed both, Horman,

   (NYT33) UNDATED -- Feb. 18, 2000 -- ADV. FOR SUN., FEB. 20 --
BIZ-PROFILE-RODKIN -- Gary M. Rodkin, who moved from Tropicana to
become chief of Pepsi-Cola North America, aims to provide the
marketing expertise that will sell more soft drinks and raise
bottlers' stock prices. Among his challenges are reinvigorating
Pepsi One, the heavily marketed one-calorie cola that Pepsi put on
the market in 1998, and getting more growth out of Pepsi-Cola,
which, like Coke, has seen sales flatten in recent years. (Joyce

   (NYT32) NEW YORK -- Feb. 18, 2000 -- NY-PLANETARIUM-3 -- Some
Native Americans want the 15-ton Willamette Meteorite returned to
Oregon, not displayed in the Museum of Natural History's new
planetarium. ``This is a sacred object to the people of the
Willamette Valley,'' says Tracy Dugan, speaking for the
Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde of Oregon on Friday.
Regardless, the Rose Center for Earth and Space opens with its
reinvented Hayden Planetarium - and the controversial meteorite -

   (NYT30) CLEMSON, S.C. -- Feb. 18, 2000 -- BUSH-ASSESS -- Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas meeting with students at Clemson University
in South Carolina, which holds its Republican primary Saturday.
Ever since Sen. John McCain of Arizona humbled Bush with a 19-point
victory in New Hampshire, Bush has been on the attack, hammering
away at McCain's record day after day, in news conferences and
radio and television commercials. (Andrea Mohin/The New York Times)

section of Geoffrey Bodine's car is removed from the track at the
Daytona International Speedway after a crash in the NASCAR
Craftsman Truck Series Daytona 250 on Friday. 10 drivers and 9

MCCAIN-CONSERVATIVES-5 -- Sen. John McCain campaigning at the
Litchfield Beach and Golf Resort on Friday. Conservatives often

Bauer, the purist former head of the Family Research Council,
endorsed his pal McCain this week, the announcement surprised many
Republicans. (Chang W. Lee/The New York Times)

   (NYT25) AMBON, Indonesia -- Feb. 18, 2000 -- INDONESIA-UNREST-2

``Gypsy Rose,'' a 1964 Chevrolet Impala, on exhibit at the Petersen
Automotive Museum. In postwar Los Angeles, Chicanos resisting
intimidation appropriated a symbol of white middle-class culture
and turned it into a symbol of their own. Thus was born the jaunty,
colorful, individualized, road-hugging counterpart of the zoot suit
and the drooping mustache: the lowrider. (Monica Almeida/The New

   (NYT20) NEW YORK -- Feb. 18, 2000 -- CLINTON-LEGAL-B&AMP;W --
Richard A. Posner denounced the president, and Ronald Dworkin,
shown, took him to task. In the forthcoming issue of The New York
Review of Books, Dworkin writes that the Posner book, ``An Affair
of State'' is silly, dangerous, anti-intellectual and empty - a
partisan screed masquerading as scholarship. (New York

   (NYT19) UNDATED -- Feb. 18, 2000 -- OBIT-DAVIES -- Jane B.
Davies, an independent architectural historian whose devotion took

   (NYT18) BLOOMINGTON, Minn. -- Feb. 18, 2000 -- BUCHANAN-REFORM
-- Pat Buchanan during a press conference in Bloomington on Friday
morning. Buchanan said that his struggle for the Reform Party
presidential nomination has been boosted by the angry departure of
Gov. Jesse Ventura from the party. ``I was looking forward to this
great battle of Minnesota, a struggle for the soul of the Reform
Party,'' Buchanan declared as he claimed a victory by default.

   (NYT17) SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- Feb. 18, 2000 -- ILL-GOVERNOR --
The latest in a long line of moderate Republican governors of
Illinois, Gov. George Ryan has been overshadowed by Midwestern
governors with more activist agendas, like Tommy G. Thompson of
Wisconsin and John Engler of Michigan. But his moratorium on
executions has changed that. ``I'm going to put a stop to this,''
the governor told the attorney general. ``The system is broken.''

MCCAIN-CONSERVATIVES-3 -- Sen. John McCain with his son Jack, 13,
en route to a campaign stop at the Crowne Plaza Resort on Hilton
Head island Friday. Conservative interest groups have quarreled
with him over his support for campaign finance legislation. Lately,

abortion rights, but McCain has in fact been quite a reliable ally
to them on this issue. (Chang W. Lee/The New York Times)

MCCAIN-CONSERVATIVES-2 -- Sen. John McCain campaigning in the Old
Bishop England Gymnasium at the College of Charleston on Friday.
Though conservatives often regard the senator as a moderate,
McCain's 17-year record in Congress dramatically undercuts the Bush
camp's message that their opponent is insufficiently right-leaning.
He supports school vouchers, missile defense, the death penalty and
a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning. (Chang W. Lee/The

falling stock price and dwindling British beer sales, Bass PLC said
Friday that it was considering ``all the options'' for its brewing
business, Britain's second largest, raising the prospect that it
will be sold as the company concentrates on its hotel and leisure
chains. Likely buyers include its Dutch rival Heineken and the

   (NYT10) NEW YORK -- Feb. 18, 2000 -- NY-PLANETARIUM-1 -- On
Saturday, the Rose Center for Earth and Space opens with its
reinvented Hayden Planetarium. The building, with its austere
beauty, is not a cozy habitat for earthbound observers but a formal
world one enters with a sense of distant admiration. There are two
walkways surrounding the Hayden sphere whose common message is the
utter inconsequence of humanity compared with the universe's scales
of space and time. (Fred R. Conrad/The New York Times) LITE

   TUCSON, Ariz. _ The only thing more surprising than UCLA's
29-point loss at Arizona State was the Bruins' reaction to it.
</P>
<P>
   They had no reaction.
</P>
<P>
   No chairs were tossed. No walls were punched. A few players even
joked around in the locker room. Only freshman Jason Kapono seemed
distraught.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost like this before,'' junior guard Earl Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the problem. In the last six weeks, the Bruins have
lost five conference games by double figures. Usually, their stoic
demeanor accelerates the recovery process; they do not sulk or
dwell.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, the circumstances are different, and stoicism
won't bail them out. For one thing, it's late in the season; the
Bruins don't have six or eight weeks to correct their mistakes. For
another, the Bruins aren't improving: They've lost five of their
past six and looked as dysfunctional at Arizona State as they did
against Gonzaga two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not all. With each defeat, the pressure mounts. The
Bruins (13-10, 4-7) must win five of their last seven games to
reach the 18-victory plateau that probably would secure an NCAA
Tournament bid. If not, they're probably headed to the NIT for the
first time in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``With 17 (wins), you could make a case for (an at-large berth),
but I'd feel a lot more comfortable with 18,'' coach Steve Lavin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the matter of opponent. After the Bruins lost
to Washington, they had Washington State to feast upon. After they
lost to Arizona, they had Arizona State in the comforts of Pauley
Pavilion. After the Cal debacle, they welcomed USC.
</P>
<P>
   But this is different. The Bruins aren't facing Washington State
and they aren't playing at home. Instead, they're searching for
rhythm and confidence against Arizona in McKale Center, where far
better UCLA teams than this have been cooked, carved and served.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, the Bruins were 3-1 in McKale when they won the
Pac-10 title. In the six years they didn't, they lost in McKale
!ital!by an average of 14.3 points!off!.
</P>
<P>
   If they're good enough to win the league, they're good enough to
win here. If they aren't, they usually are not competitive in
Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely confident,'' Watson said. ``This team will play
very hard at Arizona. That's a given, because of the rivalry with
Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing hard will help, but it won't be enough. The Bruins have
to play smart. They have to be patient on offense. They have to
take good shots. They have to be fundamentally sound on defense,
hustle in transition, make their free throws and treat the ball
like a roll of $100 bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team has been in this position before,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, that's been a blessing. Today, it could be a
curse.

 WALTER FRANK, 91, EX-CHAIRMAN OF THE BIG BOARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By REED ABELSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Walter Nils Frank, a Wall Street executive who served
as chairman of the board of governors of the New York Stock
Exchange in the mid-1960s, died on Tuesday at a retirement home in
Hanover, N.H. He was 91 and had moved to Hanover in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the New York Stock Exchange for more than six
decades, Frank actively preached the virtues of Wall Street to the
public, which had become generally wary of stocks after the market
crash of 1929, and to Washington, where he helped shape some of the
policies affecting the securities industry.
</P>
<P>
   Frank ``was a tireless campaigner on behalf of capitalism,''
said Richard A. Grasso, the current chairman of the exchange. Along
with the exchange's president at the time, Keith Funston, Frank
played a crucial role in the national effort in the 1950s and 1960s
to convince millions of Americans to own stock, Grasso said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank also represented the interests of Wall Street to
legislators and regulators, Grasso said, persuading them of the
importance of Wall Street to the country. `` Frank was one of the
very early leaders who went to Washington to tell our story,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank was elected to the board of governors of the exchange in
1959 and became vice chairman in 1962. He was chairman from 1965 to
1967. After the exchange was revamped, he served on the new board
of directors for six years and was active in discussions with
Congress and the SEC about how the industry should be regulated.
</P>
<P>
   As vice chairman of the exchange in 1963, Frank was responsible
for halting trading just 26 minutes after word of President John F.
Kennedy's shooting. ``I attempted to remain calm,'' he told The New
York Times.
</P>
<P>
   After spending nearly 40 years at the firm of Marcus &AMP; Co.,
where he worked on the trading floor as a specialist, Frank formed
his own firm, Walter N. Frank &AMP; Co., in 1971. Although he retired
in 1988, he remained a partner there until his death.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Brooklyn, Frank entered New York University in 1924
before leaving to work as a sales assistant at a water pump
company. Presented with a necktie as a Christmas bonus, he decided
to seek his fortune on Wall Street, according to his grandson,
Stephen. He became a clerk on Wall Street at $30 a week and became
a member of the exchange in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the consummate optimist,'' Grasso said. When asked how
he was, he would reply ``Bullish,'' his grandson recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Frank is survived by his daughter, Judith Frank Ketterer, of
Lyme, N.H.; a sister, Elsa Hintze, of Hanover; six grandchildren;
and six great-grandchildren. His wife of 67 years, Ruth Carlson
Frank, died in 1998. Their son, Walter N. Frank Jr., died in 1995. &QL;

GIULIANI GOT DONATIONS FROM DEVELOPER EYEING COMMUNITY GARDEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the latest flare-up over the city's demolition of
a Lower East Side community garden to make way for a housing and
retail development, the chairwoman of the New York State Democratic
Committee released records Friday showing that Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani had received more than $32,000 in campaign contributions
from the development concern planning to build housing on the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we know Rudy Giuliani had over 32,000 reasons to rush
those bulldozers in,'' the chairwoman, Judith Hope, said in a
statement asserting that the mayor sent city workers to level the
Esperanza Garden on East Seventh Street this week as a ``quid pro
quo'' to benefit the development firm, BFC Partners, and its owner,
Donald Capoccia.
</P>
<P>
   The charge provoked an angry response from Bruce Tietelbaum, the
manager Giuliani's Senate campaign, and from Capoccia, who said his
longstanding support of the mayor was based on their common
advocacy of gay and lesbian rights.
</P>
<P>
   The garden was cleared by police and bulldozers Tuesday, even as
the state attorney general was sending lawyers to court to try to
stop them, saying the garden, created on a once-vacant, city-owned
lot, should be considered a park, subject to restrictions on its
sale.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani administration says it wants to reclaim such
properties for low- and middle-income housing.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Giuliani declined to comment on Hope's statement and
deferred to Tietelbaum, who offered a vehement attack on Democratic
campaign tactics.
</P>
<P>
   He said Capoccia's financial support of the mayor, which extends
back to his 1997 mayoral campaign, was a natural outgrowth of
Giuliani's advocacy of gay rights. ``The reason Ms. Hope is doing
this is to try to deflect attention from the mayor's record,''
Tietelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Through a spokesman, Capoccia said Friday that he had been a
financial backer of the mayor's campaigns since ``long before this
project was conceptualized.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial records released Friday by Hope listed 18
contributions by Capoccia and fellow executives at BFC dating to
1997.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hope's report and comments followed an article in The Daily News
on Friday that said Capoccia and BFC had made $46,800 in donations
to the mayor's campaigns, and that BFC, in a partnership with the
Gethsemane Garden Baptist Church, had been designated by the city
to develop the site of Esperanza garden in a process that did not
involve competitive bids.
</P>
<P>
   The company's plan for the site is to build housing under the
city's 80-20 program, which requires at least 20 percent of new
housing units be allocated for low- or moderate-income people but
allows developers to set aside those units in other new or existing
buildings, sometimes far from the latest project.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, when he was asked for details on how BFC had been
selected, Tietelbaum declined comment. ``I am not going to get
sucked in to answering questions on phony issues,'' he said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jane B. Davies, an independent architectural
historian whose devotion took her from reference librarian at
Columbia University to pre-eminent authority on the 19th-century
American architect Alexander J. Davis, died on Feb. 9. She was 86
and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Although she never received a degree in art or architectural
history, Davies was a constant presence at universities, libraries
and museums that harbored information on her chosen subjects, A.J.
Davis and the romantic movement in American 19th-century
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   With no more than her interest and a librarian's salary, she
also became an important collector of Davis' prints, drawings and
Gothic-style furniture. Some of the pieces are now at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art; the rest of her collection will go to
the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the person who published the most articles on A.J.
Davis,'' said Amelia Peck, an associated curator in the department
of American decorative arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ``If
anyone wanted to know about any facet of Davis' career, Jane was
the authority to call.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies was born in 1913 in Amboy, Ill. The daughter of a
small-town banker, Davies told her niece that she had ``always felt
a hankering to go to New York.''
</P>
<P>
   After receiving her B.A. at Wellesley College in 1935 and
teaching for several years at girls' preparatory schools in
Illinois and Colorado, she earned degrees in German history and
library science at Columbia University in 1942 and 1944. Davies
became a reference librarian and rare books cataloger at Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942 she married a musician, Lyn Davies, against her father's
wishes. Her brother, Warren H. Badger, a lawyer, gave the couple
money that they quickly spent on acquiring an architectural print
by Piranesi. Lyn Davies became an organist and choirmaster and in
his free time a composer. He died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Davies' interest in Davis began in the late 1950s. At the
time, nobody else was studying Davis, a prolific contributor to
Victorian picturesque architecture and the designer of landmarks
including the Wadsworth Atheneum (with Ithiel Town) in Hartford;
Lyndhurst in Tarrytown, N.Y.; and the U.S. Customs House in
Manhattan (with Town and others).
</P>
<P>
   Davies, who friends described here as a tiny woman with a quiet
but commanding presence, was soon a familiar figure poring over
Davis documents at Avery Library, the New-York Historical Society,
the New York Public Library and the Metropolitan Museum.
</P>
<P>
   When financial problems led the the New-York Historical Society
to sell some Davis drawings, Davies bought several and donated them
to Avery Library. She wrote frequently about Davis for scholarly
journals and exhibition catalogs and contributed the article on
Davis to the Macmillan Encyclopedia of Architects.
</P>
<P>
   Her introduction to the 1980 reprint of Davis' Rural Residences,
the first American pattern book of architectural house plans, was
hailed by the Journal of Architectural Historians as ``a herculean
task'' prepared by ``a scholar known to every historian of American
architecture.''
</P>
<P>
   The greatest recognition of her achievement came with the
1992-93 exhibition ``Alexander Jackson Davis, American Architect,''
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, for which she was the consulting
curator.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her brother, of Dixon, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 30 years, Davies worked on a critical biography of
the architect, which she may not have completed; other
architectural historians did not produce such a biography, leaving
the field to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all rooting for her to get her book, the definitive
study on Davis, done,'' said Richard Jenrette, the financier and
collector of 19th-century American houses. ``I wouldn't be
surprised if she had it hidden away somewhere.''

OFFICER SUES, SAYING RIGHTS WERE VIOLATED

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A police officer who contends that he was arrested in
a drug sweep only because he is Hispanic filed a federal civil
rights lawsuit against the Police Department Friday, charging that
it continues to pursue disciplinary charges against him even though
his criminal case was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The suit filed by the officer, Aki Perez, in U.S. District Court
in Manhattan is the latest case in which Hispanic and black
officers have charged that the department discriminates by treating
them more harshly in disciplinary proceedings than it treats white
officers.
</P>
<P>
   But police officials said it was appropriate to continue
administrative proceedings against Perez. Lt. Sean Crowley, a
department spokesman, said that in addition to the drug arrest,
Perez, 25, was suspended in October after the police said he had
broken the window of a girlfriend's apartment during a domestic
dispute. The department has denied that its disciplinary process is
discriminatory.

   Perez, who has been on the force for four years, says in his
suit that he was off duty and walking from his house to his
mother's in the East New York section of Brooklyn on Feb. 23, 1999,
when he was stopped by two officers on Van Siclen Avenue. The
officers searched him for drugs, found nothing and let him go when
he said he was a police officer, according to the lawsuit. But, the
suit says, a second set of officers approached him a few minutes
later, asserting that he fit the description of someone reported to
have bought drugs in the area. They arrested him on charges of
loitering and criminal possession of heroin, even though they did
not find any drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only crime he was guilty of was that he was Latino and he
lived in East New York,'' said Jonathan Moore, his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The arresting officers' version of the incident is different.
Law enforcement officials said Perez had been identified as a
heroin buyer by an undercover officer. They said the first pair of
officers approached Perez on the basis of the undercover officer's
description, but let him go without searching him when he
identified himself as a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn district attorney's office declined to pursue drug
charges against Perez, and the loitering charge was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Perez's suit seeks $5 million in damages. He has been placed on
desk duty while he awaits the outcome of the disciplinary charges.

USC FEELING THE PRESSURE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ The season is not quite on the line when USC
plays Arizona State today, unless you listen to the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, it's a do-or-die game,'' forward Brian
Scalabrine said after the team's shootaround Friday. ``If we can
get a win, we can be in fourth place and look pretty good for the
rest of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Added forward David Bluthenthal: ``This is a tournament game. We
need a win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (13-10, 6-5) need to win five of their last seven
games for a realistic shot at an NCAA Tournament berth. That's a
tall order, considering they have lost four straight and five of
their past six games.
</P>
<P>
   It becomes even more unlikely if they lose to the Sun Devils
(15-9, 7-5), who are also fighting for an at-large bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be tough to come back from a loss like this, for either
team,'' Scalabrine said. ``We're just trying to get a win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans' predicament isn't quite as dire as it sounds, but
it's close. They will have two more road games after today's
contest at Wells Fargo Arena, and if they defeat either Stanford
(highly unlikely) or Cal, they still could make the tournament if
they sweep their four home games.
</P>
<P>
   Little impact: Almost ignored in the narrow loss to Arizona was
the disappointing performance of Bluthenthal, who had seven points
and six rebounds, and failed to grab any rebounds in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   It was his third sub-par game in the past four, which is
probably an indication of why the Trojans are slumping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see what happens,'' Bluthenthal said. ``I had two bad
games against Stanford and Cal, then I had a good game against
UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I would have come through against Arizona, then we probably
would have won.''
</P>
<P>
   Pleasant surprise: The play of Kostas Charissis against Arizona
was an unexpected boost for the Trojans. He had career highs in
points (nine), rebounds (eight), assists (four) and minutes (33).
He also stayed out of foul trouble, something he has rarely done
all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I just need more minutes to get going,'' Charissis
said.
</P>
<P>
   As a reward for his strong play, Charissis will start today's
game against Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   Desert wrath: It seems every time USC coach Henry Bibby goes to
Tucson, someone gets angry. This trip was no different. After
Arizona center Loren Woods, who has a sore back, had no blocked
shots against the Trojans, Bibby said, ``We went up against one of
the best shot blockers in the nation and he didn't do much.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't please Arizona Daily Star columnist Greg Hansen, who
wrote ``Bibby couldn't leave town without putting his foot in his
mouth again. Last year he called the McKale (Center) crowd `rude.'
</P>
<P>
   ``What game was Bibby watching? Woods scored 17 points and had
eight rebounds, which was a considerably better line than USC's
centers had.''

GORE WALKS POLITICAL TIGHTROPE ON TRADE DEAL WITH CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (REWRITES lede; REPLACES 5th graf with reaction from campaign;
DELETES 9th graf to conform;   ADDS Sweeney received letter in 8th

 By DAVID E. SANGER and KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just a day after reassuring union leaders that he
would negotiate a tougher trade deal with China if elected
president, Vice President Al Gore felt obliged to write a letter
Friday to reiterate his support for the trade agreement that
President Clinton is trying to push through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, to a leading business lobby, underscored the
politically agonizing position Gore finds himself in as he tries to
mollify two groups he desperately needs in the election, business
executives who have pressed for the accord and union members who
want to defeat it.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to court both, Gore has in the last few days led each
side to believe that it has his support in one of the nation's most
contentious trade disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's letter, to the National Association of Manufacturers, was
sent after White House officials had been left fuming by his
appearance before the AFL-CIO on Thursday in New Orleans. Although
Gore told the union officials that he supported the China deal, the
labor leaders said he had also reiterated in his closed-door
meeting that, if elected, he would negotiate tougher accords that
include guarantees that countries like China would respect labor
rights and environmental standards.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign played down any apparent conflict in Gore's
positions, but it was clear that his statements had unsettled the
White House, which was eager for him to clarify his position. But
campaign officials did not elaborate on any  &UR; &AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP; &LR; 
political considerations behind the letter.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore's comments in New Orleans circulated here on Thursday,
some administration officials who are working to win passage of one
of the biggest trade deals in history expressed fears that his
implicit criticism of the shortcomings could give ammunition to
those looking to sink the pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't exactly deft,'' an economic adviser to Clinton said
Friday. ``There was a clear argument to make about the national
security importance of this agreement, and he failed to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   One Democratic leader who has spoken to Gore and Clinton said:
``He's in an agonizing spot. He can't afford to alienate the
unions, and they've made this deal public enemy No. 1. And he can't
break with the president. So he's all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   But even in the letter he tried to walk a fine line. ``As I have
said publicly and privately,'' he wrote, ``I support the agreement
reached by our administration on the terms under which China will
be permitted to accede to the World Trade Organization.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an effort to keep union supporters from bolting, he
added: ``I agree with President Clinton that future trade
negotiations ought to include in the fabric of the agreement both
labor and environmental components.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future,'' he added, ``I will also insist on the
authority to enforce workers' rights and environmental protections
in those agreements.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   A top executive at the business group, Mike Baroodui, said:
``Gore's comments made a tough job even tougher. We were worried
that people who were looking for a plausible way out or even to
delay the vote could draw some aide and comfort from Gore's
comments. The letter removes that worry.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen how actively the vice president will push
the accord, because he cannot afford to alienate organized labor.
But the lobby was thrilled that the letter put him on the record as
clearly supporting the Clinton agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore insists that he would revisit China's adherence to
labor and environmental standards, as a practical matter he will
have little leverage. After China is a member of the WTO,
Washington will have lost its main negotiating leverage over
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   And after China is a member, it will join the other developing
nations that argue that ``labor rights'' and ``environmental
standards'' are simply code words for a Western conspiracy to force
them to pay higher wages and spend billions of dollars on
environmental measures.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments about whether the WTO should even examine the links
among labor standards, the environment and trade sped the collapse
of the trade talks in Seattle in December. Administration officials
now concede that that meeting was among their biggest blunders of
Clinton's second term. Gore, sensing the clash, carefully skipped
the event.
</P>
<P>
   But the AFL-CIO, among other groups, was greatly emboldened by
the Seattle demonstrations, where the protests led by union members
``shifted the debate about globalization,'' John Sweeney, the
president of the union federation, said this week in New Orleans.
``Coming off of Seattle, we are at a historic turning point.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinking the China deal is clearly the next objective, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Sweeney, who received a copy of the letter,
disagreed with those who believe that Gore had said anything to the
unions that undercut Clinton or the trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president has been consistent,'' Sweeney said. ``His
letter reiterates the position he took at the AFL-CIO convention in
Los Angeles in October. When the vice president addressed the
Executive Council on Thursday, he took pains to tell the council
that he supported the president on the deal with China.''
</P>
<P>
   In October, even before the China deal had been signed, Gore had
called for enforceable labor protections in trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders are focusing on members of Congress in pivotal
districts, an effort that makes many Democrats wary of signing up
with the White House. And for the first time, the unions are trying
to create alliances of convenience with conservative Republicans
who oppose the China deal on the grounds of national security.
</P>
<P>
   The unions are clearly overjoyed by Gore's vacillation. No one
expected him to break publicly from the White House, and in fact he
has repeatedly said he favors China's admission to the WTO. But his
willingness to talk about the need for a tougher deal sends a
signal that this one is flawed.
</P>
<P>
   The White House disagrees. ``This is an agreement that helps
American workers here and that ultimately lifts the standards of
workers in China over time,'' Sandy Berger, the national security
adviser, said in a recent interview. By gradually enveloping China
in a system largely run by Western standards, Berger argued, China
will see the benefits of changing its ways. In any case, he added,
``this agreement can't be renegotiated.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the unions hope that it can be. The president of the
United Steel Workers, George Becker, who has been pressing Gore for
two years to stop low-cost steel imports, said this week his union
would do its best to sink the efforts to win approval of the trade
deal. Then, he said, ``We're going to give the Gore administration
an opportunity to deal with it.''

IRANIANS FLOCK TO POLLS TO CHOOSE NEW PARLIAMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (subs 2nd graf to remove Eastern time)  
 (bl)

<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Clutching palm cards from their favorite
political parties and crumpled hand-drawn lists of candidates for
their national parliament, so many Iranians streamed to the polls
Friday that officials were forced to extend the voting time by two
hours.
</P>
<P>
   People were still waiting in line to vote outside of mosques and
schools in Tehran when the polls closed at 9 p.m., 12 hours after
balloting had begun.
</P>
<P>
   The apparently big turnout heartened reformers who support the
country's liberal president, Mohammad Khatami, and who hoped to
ride into power on a wave of popular discontent with the right-wing
clergy that has dominated the country for 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 5,000 candidates running for the 290 seats in the
parliament, or Majlis, and vote-counting to be done by hand, the
Ministry of Interior predicted that full results may not be known
for up to three weeks. But officials said they may be able to say
within a day or two how many of Iran's nearly 38 million eligible
voters actually cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists for the reformers have said that the size of the
turnout will be a key indicator of public support for their vision
of a society where conservative Muslim clerics would no longer
regulate how people dress, what they watch on television or what
they read in their newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   But a hefty turnout might also have reflected the still powerful
authority of hardliners, who have portrayed some of their opponents
as leftist extremists and have proved themselves capable of
marshaling hundreds of thousands of people to their defense on a
moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for turning out to vote were not always because of
the lofty platforms of the different parties and independent
candidates. Some voted out of fear that they would be penalized if
they did not have the stamp in their passport showing they
participated in the elections, which the ruling clerics have
declared a religious duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be important for her when she goes to university,''
said Souzan Ibrahimi, who voted in a working-class neighborhood in
east Tehran with her 17-year-old daughter Nooshin. Both said they
voted for a list of candidates supporting Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   A large turnout of 71 percent, buoyed by the young people and
women who account for a majority of Iran's voting-age population,
is credited with lifting Khatami to the presidency in 1997. While
conservative candidates did not openly criticize the president,
support for him was the central theme of the campaign by an
eclectic coalition of reformers that included Khatami's brother,
writers, clerics and former government officials sacked for
promoting a free press.
</P>
<P>
   While he did not specifically endorse those running under his
banner, Khatami made an open pitch for change in comments after
voting in his home town of Jamaran in northern Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our society is in need of law and the rule of law,'' he said
in a statement quoted by the official Iranian news agency IRNA.
``The Majlis is the law-making house and the house of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Of those who agreed to speak with foreigners about the election,
many said they voted for the pro-Khatami candidates. But they also
said they hedged their bets by voting for some of the
self-proclaimed moderates, like the former president, Ali Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani, and a few familiar right-wing names as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Khatami people win too big a majority in the Majlis,
there could be trouble here,'' said one man, who would not give his
name, after voting in an upper-middle class neighborhood of north
Tehran. ``I'd rather there was fighting in the Majlis than fighting
on the streets.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since Khatami's election, his opponents in and out of the
government have tried to head off another big win for the
reformers.
</P>
<P>
   A leading reform cleric, Abdullah Nouri, was convicted of
apostasy and sent to prison three months ago after he criticized
the near-absolute powers granted by Iran's constitution to a
non-elected religious ``supreme leader.'' He had been considered a
favorite to win a Majlis seat on the reformers' list.
</P>
<P>
   The Majlis also recently increased the voting age to 16 years
old from 15, eliminating an estimated 1.5 million young people who
might have voted for the liberals from the voter lists. It also
lowered the bar for all parliamentary candidates to 25 percent of
the vote from 33 percent and cut the hours of voting to a maximum
of 12 hours from 14.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the polling stations in the Tehran area were
packed, with women wrapped in the enveloping black chador,
teen-agers in blue jeans, and men dressed in business suits and
ties. There were no private voting booths so people clustered
around the posted lists of candidates, sometimes discussing until
the last moment which of the 2,000 they would choose for the 30
spots from Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   At the Imam Hussein mosque in east Tehran, Masoumeh Ramazoni
consulted a creased strip of paper with the names of 30 candidates
that her family and friends had agreed on after a long night of
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really had to do a lot of research,'' Ramazoni said. ``I
read all their ads and looked at the level of education they had.
Most of my choices are engineers and have higher degrees.''
</P>
<P>
   Khatami has talked of creating what he calls a civil society, of
reaching out to the West and of liberalizing the stagnant public
sector dominated economy. While Iran is noticeably more open
culturally than it was before his election _ with a proliferation
of feisty newspapers, daring plays and films dealing with social
problems, and some public criticism of past government leaders _ he
has not achieved much in terms of legislation in the outgoing
conservative Majlis.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his past supporters have lost faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Khatami promised freedom but he hasn't delivered,'' said
Mariam Zhandi, an 18-year-old Tehran student who said she was
voting only for a few people she knew personally. ``I wouldn't vote
for him again.''
</P>
<P>
   Freedom for Zhandi would consist of walking in the park with her
fiancee without the fear of being picked up by the morals police
for consorting with a man before marriage. ``Once they took us to
the police station and I had to call my mom to come and get us,''
she said. ``Now I ask you: is it better for boys and girls to walk
on the street together or to go to a house where certain things
could happen?''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In the depressed southwest suburb of Islamshahr, where jobless
men rioted five years ago and were met with a violent crackdown by
police, the atmosphere in the polling places was more subdued.
</P>
<P>
   Few people spoke as they scanned the list of candidates or
huddled over their ballots. ``For every 10 people here, there are
three spies,'' said one man, nodding toward the seemingly aimless
young men hanging around the courtyard of the mosque where people
voted.
</P>
<P>
   But 78 percent of Islamshahr's votes went to Khatami two and a
half years ago _ more than his nationwide percentage. ``I don't
think much will change here in terms of the economy,'' said
Mohammad Hasani, one of the legions of unemployed in the town.
``Almost everyone will vote for the Khatami people. They represent
a little bit of hope.''

<P>
   LONDON _ Faced with a falling stock price and dwindling British
beer sales, Bass PLC said Friday that it was considering ``all the
options'' for its brewing business, Britain's second-largest,
raising the prospect that it will be sold as the company
concentrates on its hotel and leisure chains.
</P>
<P>
   Likely buyers include its Dutch rival Heineken and the
acquisitive South African Breweries, analysts said. ``If Bass is
for sale, we will surely study the matter,'' said Albert
Holtzappel, a spokesman for Heineken.
</P>
<P>
   Bass declined to say publicly whether its brewing business,
which produces Carling and Tennent's lagers and Caffrey's Irish
ale, was definitely on the block, but executives said selling was
one option.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process starts now,'' one executive said. ``They can come
and approach us and we will respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Price, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston,
forecast that a sale of the brewing business could raise as much as
$3.2 billion, which Bass might use to acquire a further hotel
chain.
</P>
<P>
   Bass, which exports Bass ales to the United States and also owns
the Holiday Inn, Crown Plaza and Inter-Continental hotel chains,
has seen its stock-price slip by 41 percent since April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Word of a possible sale, however, sent the share price up 6
pence, to 701 pence, or $1.28, and pushed other brewery stocks
higher.
</P>
<P>
   The move toward selling the brewing business reflects a much
wider ferment in the British drinks and leisure markets where
buyers have been scrambling to acquire pubs and bars.
</P>
<P>
   Punch Taverns Group Ltd. paid $4.45 billion for Allied Domecq
PLC's 3,500 British pubs last year and later sold 550 of them to
Bass. Scottish &AMP; Newcastle bought 868 pubs, restaurants and budget
hotels from the ailing Greenall's Group PLC for $1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While Britons still spend their money in pubs and bars, their
favored tipples are changing to the disadvantage of brewers, whose
erstwhile offerings of tepid ales and fizzy lagers once formed the
unchallenged staple of the country's pubgoers.
</P>
<P>
   British beer consumption fell 7 percent between 1990 and 1997,
while a set of regulations called the Beer Orders limits the number
of pubs that brewers may own. That has forced brewers, battling for
market share, to look elsewhere for growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ratings of British brewing stocks have been depressed by a
lack of growth opportunities,'' Price of Credit Suisse First Boston
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nigel Popham, an analyst with the London brokerage firm Teather
&AMP; Greenwood, said that Bass, which owns breweries in China and the
Czech Republic, had been thwarted in its ambitions to become a
global brewer and had decided to focus on high-growth leisure and
hotel businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are selling out of a business that is growing very
modestly and hoping to re-invest the proceeds where growth is much
higher _ pubs and international hotels,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bass' brewing operations contributed 19 percent of pretax profit
last year compared with 40 percent from its hotels and about 36
percent from pubs and outlets like the All Bar One and O'Neills
chains.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A senior Russian national security official who met
with President Clinton Friday appeared to open the door slightly to
meeting the administration's desire to deploy a limited national
missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   But the official, Sergei Ivanov, the head of Russia's national
security council, also said Russia wanted to keep the essence of
the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty that the administration is
seeking to change.
</P>
<P>
   After lengthy meetings at the White House Friday and on
Thursday, Ivanov told a news conference at the Russian Embassy
Friday evening that Moscow was prepared to discuss allowing the
United States to move its current authorized site, of a radar and
interceptors in North Dakota, to another location.
</P>
<P>
   The North Dakota site, allowed under the ABM Treaty and designed
to protect a field of intercontinental missiles, was dismantled in
the mid 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. arms control negotiators have told the Russians that they
want to move the site to Alaska, in order to protect the United
States from the threat of ballistic missile attacks from North
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are talking about the geographic changes to deploy the
system, instead of North Dakota, somewhere else,'' that was
possible, Ivanov said. ``This is going to be the subject of further
discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ivanov prefaced that remark by saying, `If we are talking
about slightly modifying the ABM Treaty at the same time as
deploying national missile defense, these two things simply can't
exist together.''
</P>
<P>
   The ABM Treaty, agreed to in 1972 and amended in 1974,
explicitly precludes a national missile defense system but allows
each side to deploy one system of defense that would protect just
one specific part of its territory.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has said Clinton will make a decision on whether
to deploy a limited missile defense system this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In a standard Russian defense of the ABM Treaty, Ivanov
described the treaty as ``extremely valuable to us _ among other
factors because it is very short, very clear and precise.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been pushing a proposal for a
limited national defense system _ meaning one that would protect
the United States from, say, tens of missiles from North Korea _
with the Russians since last year.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said it would have no comment on Ivanov's
remarks. ``There's not an overwhelming desire to shed much light,''
a spokesman for the National Security Council, Mike Hammer, said.
</P>
<P>
   During the talks in the last two days, Hammer said that senior
administration officials had tried to make clear that the missile
defense plan was not directed against Russia but against the common
threat that the United States and Russia faced from countries such
as North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov's talks here were the most intense between the
administration and a powerful Russian official since the acting
president, Vladimir Putin, took over the Kremlin on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   During his two days in Washington, Ivanov met for six hours with
the president's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, as well as
with Clinton and the director of central intelligence, George J.
Tenet.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials describe Ivanov as one of the
officials closest to Putin, and far more powerful than the Russian
foreign minister, Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   Like Putin, the national security head worked with the KGB and
its successor agency, the FSB.
</P>
<P>
   With his slim bearing and brisk manner, and at the same age as
Putin, 47, he resembles the acting president physically and
stylistically.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview with the newspaper Komsomolshaya Pravda,
Sergei Ivanov talked tough about Russia regaining its stature and
in particular about Russia's war in Chechnya. ``Carrying out a
large scale military operation, in my view, seems totally
justified,'' Ivanov said
</P>
<P>
   In that interview, he said that under Putin, Russia was
reversing the trend of having ``lost its voice'' and that now
Russia had showed ``we still know how to bite.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the news conference Friday at the Russian Embassy, Ivanov
was more polite and diplomatic. He said the purpose of his trip was
to ``exclude the emergence of surprises in our bilateral
relationship.'' He wanted, he said, to inject some
``predictability'' into the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Ivanov was asked about the whereabouts
of the Russian journalist Andrei Babitsky, who works for Radio Free
Europe/Radio Liberty, and is now missing, apparently in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky had angered the Russian government with his reporting.
He was held by Russian security forces last month and then,
according to the Russian government, was handed over to Chechen
forces in exchange for several Russian soldiers. He has not been
heard from since.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov said on Friday that Babitsky was with ``the rebels'' in
Chechnya. But he added, ``as far as I know our special services
know his whereabouts approximately'' inside Chechnya and which
rebel units he is with. ``I assure you that we will take all
possible efforts to get the release of Babitsky. The fate of any
Russian citizen is the cause of our concern.''

COLUMN: GET-RICH SHOWS LEAVE WOMEN HOLDING THE REMOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   We already have the first winner in the Who Wants to Be a
Millionairess Contest, which was announced only last week in this
space. Readers were asked to redress the gender problem on ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' _ 90 percent of the contestants are
male _ by devising a female-friendly game show.
</P>
<P>
   The winner, of course, is Fox television, which triumphed in the
Nielsen ratings on Tuesday with ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?'' The program was denounced for presenting an
offensively sexist stereotype of women, but for some reason it was
watched by more women (10 million) than men (7 million). The next
day so many women applied to be contestants that the Web site
crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, though, this show may not be for everyone. There
are probably some women in America unwilling to run off and marry a
rich man sight unseen (just as there are even some guys unwilling
to marry someone after seeing her in a bathing suit). Some women
could be especially reluctant to play if they thought their current
husbands would be watching.
</P>
<P>
   So the contest continues for another get-rich-quick game, and it
may be a good idea to learn a lesson from Fox's success. The lesson
is that the enlightened new era of complete sexual equality is not
yet here.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't been heeded by the ``Millionaire'' producers, who
have tried to be fair by giving men and women the same computerized
tests by telephone. But this equality seems to be unfair to women,
as I heard from an array of would-be contestants like Andrea Carla
Michaels.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first game show I haven't been able to get on,''
said Michaels, a San Francisco trivia buff who has been on
``Jeopardy,'' ``Win Ben Stein's Money'' and other shows. She phones
in daily to take the ``Millionaire'' test, but she's been stymied
by the qualifying questions.
</P>
<P>
   Each question requires that four things be put in order. You may
have to arrange four European countries from west to east. Or, to
use an example encountered by Michaels, you may have to list the
following four movies in chronological order: ``Thin Red Line,''
``Green Card,'' ``Yellow Submarine' and ``Blue Velvet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Seemingly nonsexist, right?'' Michaels said. ``I've seen all
of them, can name the stars, who directed them, can speak at length
about Andie McDowell's studio apartment in New York complete with a
rooftop greenhouse, or how Isabella Rossellini was with David Lynch
at the time, so why did he leave her so naked out there, etc.
</P>
<P>
   ``But tell you which came first, `Blue Velvet' or `Green Card'?
Zero idea. That is a very male way to think about a film. Women
could do fine with the straight trivia questions that are actually
on the show, but most of us can't get through the qualifying
rounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Her complaint resonated with Dr. Helen Fisher, an anthropologist
at Rutgers University who surveyed male-female brain differences in
her 1999 book, ``The First Sex: The Natural Talents of Women and
How They Are Changing the World.'' The ordering question requires
what Fisher calls step thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both men and women practice step thinking, but men do more of
it,'' she said. ``They're more likely to compartmentalize, get rid
of extraneous data and proceed in a straightforward path. They make
faster decisions because they consider fewer variables. Women tend
to collect more data and assemble it into more complex patterns _
what I call web thinking. They're better at generalizing and
synthesizing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Millionaire'' could be fairer if it dispensed with the
ordering questions, especially the geographical ones, which play to
men's spatial skills. But the program, like other trivia game
shows, would still probably appeal to more men than women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Straight trivia questions seem boring to a lot of women
because they're so simple,'' said James M. Dabbs, a psychologist at
Georgia State University who has studied testosterone's role in
focusing men on simple, competitive tasks. ``Men needed to focus on
one thing when they were fighting each other for mates. They
evolved for fast, energetic, explosive action, panache, and short
lives. Women evolved for enduring relationships and the long
haul.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's marriage competition might have been gloriously moronic
and tasteless, but it was still more complex than a trivia game.
Courtship is more complicated than geography. The challenge is to
find a still more intricate game. Our researchers hope to
field-test, perhaps in the spring, a prototype that does not
require anyone to wear a bathing suit or marry a motivational
speaker.

ROBOTS TO STUDY NUCLEAR PLANT LEAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Technicians who returned to the containment dome at Consolidated
Edison's Indian Point 2 nuclear plant in Buchanan, N.Y., said it
appeared unchanged despite a radiation leak Tuesday, and plant
managers expected to open up the steam generator where the leak
occurred by the middle of next week, a spokesman for the company
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But identifying which of the more than 2,000 tubes in that
generator was the site of the leak could take longer, according to
a Con Ed vice president, Stephen E. Quinn, because that job will
probably be done by robots being shipped to the plant by
Westinghouse, the company that built the generators. The first
robot should arrive by next weekend, and as many as six may be
used.
</P>
<P>
   Each robot has an arm that can carry a tiny video camera into a
tube, or a probe that looks for defects in the tube walls by
measuring how electric currents move through the metal, Quinn said.
Con Ed plans to inspect all four steam generators in a process that
could take three to four weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   To cope with defective tubes, technicians can install plugs or
insert liners inside them to cover the defective portion.

GROUPS PLAN SUIT TO STOP A BALLPARK IN QUEENS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the latest twist in the Giuliani administration's
quest to bring minor-league baseball to New York, civic groups and
politicians in Queens are vowing to sue to stop the city from
building a $5 million ball field at St. John's University for an
Single-A team affiliated with the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The city had suddenly turned to the St. John's campus last month
after its plan to build a temporary ballpark at the parade grounds
near Prospect Park in Brooklyn ran into political opposition and a
lawsuit. But civic groups in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood
surrounding St. John's have been no more receptive to the team,
which would be called Kings of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   After a Thursday meeting of 250 residents that was called by
four neighborhood groups to ``stop the stadium,'' scores of people
marched in protest to the St. John's ball field, where the stadium
would be built. They said the proposed 3,500-seat ballpark would
draw thousands of fans to a quiet neighborhood of single-family
homes, worsening traffic and parking problems. The outdoor lighting
and public address systems would also disrupt the community, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to court,'' said state Sen. Frank Padavan, a
Republican who represents the area and lives there. ``It's the only
option left open to us. We tried to convince them that this was a
mistake. That size stadium at that location will have a negative
impact on the quality of life and on property values.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the city's Economic Development Corp., Bruce
Brodoff, declined to discuss the stadium deal. ``At this point we
are very close to finalizing an agreement with St. John's,'' he
said. ``We don't have any comment on the proposed lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   St. John's also declined to discuss the pending lawsuit. Joseph
Sciame, a vice president at the school, said the Kings' ballpark
would not be disruptive, since there is adequate parking on campus
and the college would be quieting down for the summer as the team's
season started in June.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to mollify local critics, the Mets recently
promised to provide tickets for local groups, to conduct baseball
clinics and educational programs for young people and to allow
local school teams to use the field. The St. John's baseball team
would also share the field. Finally, the Mets agreed to ban the
sale of beer and limit the number of night games. ``I think that
what we've proposed is most extensive community outreach program in
all of minor-league baseball,'' said David Howard, vice president
and general counsel of the Mets. ``We've worked to eliminate or
minimize any adverse affects.''
</P>
<P>
   Most economists question the wisdom of public investments in
sports stadiums and arenas, but Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has made
them a centerpiece of his administration. He has proposed building
a football stadium for the New York Jets in Manhattan, as well as
new stadiums for both the Yankees and the Mets, at an estimated
cost to taxpayers of more than $1.5 billion.

FINANCIAL ADVISERS SAY, TAKE LUMP SUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY CHRIS SIEROTY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You're feeling lucky. California's lotto jackpot is so big that
just thinking about winning an estimated $60 million brings on a
cold sweat. You're thinking, What would I do with all that cash?
</P>
<P>
   Well, you've got two options even before your numbers come up:
taking the cash up front or opting for the payout.
</P>
<P>
   So winning tonight's expected jackpot would net you about $30
million in a lump sum payment or 26 annual payments with the first
totaling $1.5 million and the second totaling $3 million, before
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of area financial planners said the decision is
relatively simple: Take the money up front and exercise some
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably better to take the lump sum payment and invest
your winnings with the help of a financial planner,'' said Robert
Detterman, a certified financial planner with Bo-Gin Financial Inc.
in Westlake Village.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Ernst, a financial consultant with Sun America Securities
in Woodland Hills, also recommended taking the lump sum payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get the advantage of the interest on the lump sum working
for you, instead of the interest working for the government,'' he
said. ``In the long run, you will come out ahead if you take the
lump sum.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth D. Gross agreed, saying the winner should invest the
money and receive a higher return than if he or she took 26
payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (California Lottery officials) invest the lump sum in
U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds, at about 5 percent interest,''
said Gross, a certified financial planner with Strategic Financial
in Thousand Oaks. ``You can average more than that on your own in a
conservative mutual fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking this approach on your own could turn that lump sum into
tens of millions of dollars over 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, Gross said, when a lot of people come into a
large sum of money for the first time, it seems like all the money
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mind-boggling how fast a million dollars can be spent,''
on the new house, fancy sports car, family and friends, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if I'm the big winner, I'm taking the lump sum,'' said
Gross.
</P>
<P>
   Norma Minas, spokeswoman for the California Lottery Commission,
said the number of ticket buyers now choosing the cash up front
option has risen from 44 percent two years ago to 66 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   However, one analyst says annual payments could be a smarter
investment, depending on your knowledge and maturity when it comes
to money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have a client who is financially immature, I will suggest
they take the annual payments,'' said Brent W. Kessell, a certified
financial planner with Santa Monica-based Abacus Wealth Management
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they spend every dollar for two or five or 10 years, there
is still money coming in to build a nest egg,'' he said. ``Also,
there is less emotional risk with annual payments.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're lucky enough to win tonight's lotto jackpot, the best
advice might be to seek professional advice before you begin
spending your millions.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ The fierce struggle between Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas and Sen. John McCain of Arizona has stirred such keen
interest that strategists on both sides predicted Friday that
turnout on Saturday would far exceed the presidential primary
record of 276,000 who voted in South Carolina four years ago. The
big question was by how much.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the usual primary eve chatter about the latest poll
numbers, there was far greater interest in possible turnout
figures. Strategists in each camp pored over turnout models to try
to discern which numbers would help or hurt their candidate.
</P>
<P>
   One indication of the intense interest in the race came in the
volume of absentee ballots. Counties around the state reported that
absentee ballots were being submitted at as many as three times the
rate of four years ago. Conway Belangia, director of elections for
Greenville County, on the state's northern border, said that by the
close of business Friday, about 2,600 people had voted by absentee
ballot, far surpassing the 700 absentee ballots cast in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Similar numbers were reported in Richland County, which includes
Columbia, the state capital. ``We've got 20 more standing in line
right now,'' said Gloria Wilson, chairman of the voter registration
board. ``And lots of phone calls about where to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's backers said the bigger the turnout the better for them
because they are looking to independents and Democrats who are
allowed to vote in the primary but have not participated heavily in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely need it to be 325,000,'' said John Weaver,
McCain's national political director. ``If it's 325,000 and higher,
then we're in good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Bush forces, confident they have the support of
loyal Republicans in the state, said they were ready for a large
turnout _ just not too large.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to get enough households to survive a 400,000
turnout,'' said Warren Tompkins, Bush's chief strategist here. If
even more voters flood to the polls in what he called a
``Democratic infiltration,'' Tompkins conceded said that could be
trouble for the governor.
</P>
<P>
   But while Weaver exhibited a guarded confidence, he shrugged
when asked what would happen. Despite polls showing Bush may be
slightly ahead of McCain, strategists on both sides said those
surveys do not reliably account for turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like throwing darts,'' Weaver said. ``We call it a
science. But it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   While much of the attention has focused on what seems like two
campaigns on parallel tracks _ McCain's appeals to independents and
Democrats and Bush's drive for rock-ribbed Republicans _ the
senator's aides said a crucial element of their strategy is to turn
out veterans who do not always vote. The McCain campaign, citing
the candidate's history as a war hero and as a prisoner of war in
Vietnam, is waging an enormous behind-the-scenes effort aimed at
the state's 375,000 veterans, who make up an estimated 13 percent
of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush and McCain camps seemed a bit on edge _ and
understandably unsure of the outcome. But aides on both sides said
the outcome in South Carolina is crucial. Several went so far as to
say that the nomination may well turn on what happens here. The
next two primaries, on Tuesday in Michigan and Arizona, come so
quickly that the victor in South Carolina might carry his momentum
to those states.
</P>
<P>
   The most passionate appeals came Friday from the candidates
themselves, who dashed around the state pleading with their
supporters to come to the polls. They seemed less interested in
making their pitches for new backers than making sure they rouse
their loyalists to the polls. It was clear a big moment was at hand
because of the convergence of Bush's wife, Laura, and almost all of
his top advisers; the same was true in the McCain camp, where the
senator appeared with his wife, Cindy, and their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all comes down to turnout,'' McCain declared as he stumped
across the state, hoping to jolt the electorate as he did when he
delivered a humiliating defeat to Bush in New Hampshire.
``Everything I'm doing today is aimed at voter turnout.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, at a news conference in the town of Clinton, said, ``I
suspect about everybody's made up their mind in South Carolina. Now
it's time to turn out the vote.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, the campaigns went all out in imploring their
supporters to vote, drowning them with mailings, phone calls and
radio and television advertisements. Among the efforts, every voter
identified as a Bush supporter is receiving two telephone calls;
those identified as social conservatives get a third call.
</P>
<P>
   William Brittain, 74, a retired accountant here who is a
registered Republican, said he opened his mailbox on Thursday and
found five mailings from the Bush operation. ``I also got a call
from Bush,'' he said, referring to the thousands of tape-recorded
calls Bush is making in the closing hours to thousands of
registered Republicans here.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain organization has less to spend than the Bush
operation because it is accepting federal money and thus is bound
by a state spending ceiling. But it, too, is blanketing the state
with appeals. As an example, 100,000 previously identified McCain
backers are getting postcards reminding them to vote _ and telling
them the location of their polling place.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The turnout drives are so intense that Henry McMaster, the state
Republican chairman, said he had never seen anything like it. ``I'm
waiting for a plane to come by dropping leaflets,'' he said Friday
afternoon as he looked up in the sky over the state capitol.
``That's all that's left.'' He added: ``I heard one fellow wanted
to give a lot of money to the Bush campaign. But he was told, `Just
get the vote out; we'll get the money later.' I've never heard that
before.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The battle over veterans is particularly unusual, and several
McCain advisers said they are counting on capturing at least 60
percent of the veteran vote, as they did in New Hampshire. The Bush
campaign is so concerned that it has mounted something of a counter
insurgency, questioning McCain's record on military matters and
reminding those voters that Bush served in the Air National Guard.
At a Bush event Friday, Rep. Sam Johnson of Texas took the stage
and said he himself had been in Vietnam, had been a POW for seven
years _ and was a POW with McCain for a year and a half of that
time. ``I can tell you, he cannot hold a candle to George Bush,''
Johnson said of McCain. He added of the governor: ``He was a pilot
in the Texas National Guard. So it's not that he doesn't know the
military. He does.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain is making the veteran turnout drive a particularly
high priority. Volunteers are making calls to 100,000 veterans in
the state, according to aides; the campaign is dispatching former
prisoners of war who back McCain to VFW and American Legion halls
around the state.
</P>
<P>
   Among the callers was Robin Porter, who dialed up a long list of
veterans from McCain's noisy state headquarters here on Thursday
night. ``Mr. Bryant, are you a veteran?'' Porter asked a
prospective supporter. ``I'm also a veteran. Have you thought about
voting on Saturday? You probably will? But you're on the fence? If
I might say, on behalf of John McCain, I believe he's the veterans'
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The candidates' cheery demeanor on the trail Friday, at times
obscured the nervousness of their advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seemed upbeat as he repeatedly asserted that he was going
to win. Unlike the closing days in New Hampshire, the governor
maintained a furiously busy schedule that had him in front of
television cameras at 6:30 a.m. in Charleston and did not deposit
him at his hotel in Greenville until about 10:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere was one of attention to detail _ and taking no
chances. When bad weather forced a news conference in Clinton to
more indoors, workers hastily taped more than a dozen Bush posters
over the chalkboard behind Bush, lest the television and still
cameras catch him against a drab green backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   Bush acknowledged at the first rally of the day, at Presbyterian
College in Clinton, the importance of the coming moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow's a big day in American politics,'' Bush told a crowd
of hundreds. ``And I'll tell you why it's a big day: When South
Carolina goes to vote for George W. Bush, it's the beginning of the
end of the Clinton era in Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, and his surrogates, continued his appeals for a large,
untraditional voters turnout in the Republican primary Saturday.
``I say to independents, Democrats, libertarians, vegetarians-come
on over. Vote for me,'' McCain thundered. No matter the outcome
Saturday, McCain told reporters he would carry his campaign forward
to the set of major primaries in two weeks, ``No matter what
happens, this race is decided on March 7,'' he said. ``We're very
optimistic. I could not be happier.''

TEXAS CONSIDERS COMMERCIAL LODGES FOR STATE PARKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NEIL STRASSMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Texas officials are working with a private
company on a plan to construct commercial lodges at six public
parks across Texas, Parks and Wildlife Department officials said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The lodges could promote ecotourism and encourage city dwellers
to visit state parks, said officials, who have been studying
privatization projects for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   But conservation and wildlife groups said they worry that
operating private businesses in parks could destroy Texas' few
remaining wild areas and open the door for marketing a public
resource.
</P>
<P>
   A thorough environmental impact study will be completed before a
decision is made, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first concern is conservation of natural resources,'' said
Bob Cook, deputy director for the parks agency. ``The goal would be
to develop a nature-based lodge and educational center, but we
appreciate the potential negative impacts if a project is done
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The six parks identified for possible development are Palo Duro,
near Amarillo; Caddo Lake, in East Texas near the Louisiana border;
Indian Lodge, in the Davis Mountains of West Texas; Mustang Island,
near Port Aransas on the Gulf Coast; Guadalupe River, north of San
Antonio; and Brazos Bend, west of Houston, department officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has not received any completed proposals, park
officials said, but it began working last year with San
Antonio-based Presidian Corp., developer of the Canyon of Eagles
Lodge &AMP; Nature Park, a 940-acre parcel that opened in September at
Lake Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Presidian has hired biologists and is completing an
environmental analysis of
</P>
<P>
   development at the six sites, said Steve Dutton, the company's
managing general partner. The analysis is due to the agency May 11.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation groups are quick to point out perils in such
projects. Park development degrades the environment and leads to
new roads and cleared land, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to see nature lodges in sensitive habitats or
pristine areas,'' said Brian Sybert, natural resources director of
the Sierra Club's Lone Star chapter. ``If we have the parks that
represent truly wild areas in this state, leave it wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Petersen, vice chairwoman of the Texas Committee on
Natural Resources, a statewide conservation group, said that after
a lodge is built, developers often follow with amenities such as
swimming pools, concessions and recreational vehicle hook-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon the wilderness getaway looks like the city you just
left,'' Petersen said. ``It's sort of the camel's nose under the
tent. Money does talk around here, and if they say they have put in
a substantial amount, then they want to protect the investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Petersen said she believes that the nature lodge proposal could
lead to privatizing state parks. If private businesses are making
money, then such projects should be done outside state property,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dutton said the Canyon of Eagles Lodge &AMP; Nature Park
development, about 80 miles northwest of Austin, makes the park a
preserve. The company invested $4.6 million in the project, which
has a $2 million annual operating budget that includes an $800,000
payroll, Dutton said.
</P>
<P>
   Access is restricted to the habitat of bald eagles and
endangered songbirds, such as the golden-cheeked warbler and the
black-capped vireo. The eagles are often visible, however, and the
park offers guided tours to see the other birds.
</P>
<P>
   The park has a telescope and discourages the use of bright
lights at night. The Vanishing Texas River Cruise offers tours of
the lake and the Colorado River Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has a 50-year lease, has built 64 lodge and
cottage rooms that range from $67 to $107 a day, a small conference
center that can hold 100 people, $20-a-day recreational vehicle
sites and $12-a-day camping sites. There is a $5 entry fee for
adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of this is business and another is passion,'' Dutton
said. ``We're conservationists.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lower Colorado River Authority, along with local and state
agencies, chipped in to build roads, and the river authority gets
``something less than 10 percent'' of the gross revenue, Dutton
said.
</P>
<P>
   A similar agreement could be worked out with the parks
department, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Private businesses have long operated in national parks, but the
National Park Service has in recent years allowed fewer businesses
to locate inside parks, spokesman David Barna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days of additional large structures in the parks are gone.
Philosophically, things have changed. There is a need to keep the
landscape intact,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the 20th century, Barna said, the park service
encouraged the building of rail lines to park gates and the
construction of hotels, restaurants and gift shops to attract and
accommodate visitors.
</P>
<P>
   There are over 600 concessionaires in the 370 national parks,
operating services from hotels to white-water rafting and mule
rides, Barna said. There hasn't been a lodge or hotel built in a
national park since the mid-1960s, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, many people want an outdoor experience but may not
want to sleep in a tent, Dutton said. With private lodges, the
state may be able to take a park that has been losing money and
develop it for the benefit of everyone, he said.

ABDUL-JABBAR HIRED AS CLIPPERS ASSISTANT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In an effort to upgrade their bench staff, the Los
Angeles Clippers on Friday hired Hall of Fame center Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar as an assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   He'll join former Boston Celtics great Dennis Johnson as
big-name sideline spotters for interim coach Jim Todd, who took
over the team after Chris Ford was fired Feb. 3. Abdul-Jabbar will
be in Chicago tonight, weather permitting, where the Clippers play
the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clippers are close,'' Abdul-Jabbar said of the young team
that is 11-40 and 17 games behind Minnesota for the final playoff
spot in the Western Conference. ``Basically, what they're lacking
is leadership. It will be up to coach Todd and the rest of us to
change the whole dynamic.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past few years, Abdul-Jabbar, the top scorer in NBA
history, hasn't made a secret of his desire to coach. In fact, the
historically low-profile ex-Laker recently has been on a
promotional tour for his book, ``A Season On the Reservation,''
which chronicles Abdul-Jabbar's experiences coaching
Native-Americans at the high school level.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't doubt his expertise can translate to higher education
in the pros.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got some talent,'' said Abdul-Jabbar, whose Clippers
assessment is based on TV observations. ``Maurice Taylor and Lamar
Odom are first-rate. They probably could start for any team in the
league.''
</P>
<P>
   But one player the Clippers are hoping Abdul-Jabbar's
considerable wisdom can influence is second-year center Michael
Olowokandi, who was tutored by the Hall of Famer his rookie year.
Olowokandi, the first pick in the 1998 NBA Draft, is averaging
eight rebounds and nine points, making just 44 percent of his
field-goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets into a lot of foul trouble, so he's not spending that
much time on the court,'' Abdul-Jabbar said. ``He's got a lot of
potential. I've seen what he can do. He's very intelligent and very
athletic.''
</P>
<P>
   But no match for his new teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Jabbar's experience was accrued during 20 seasons with the
Milwaukee Bucks and Lakers. A three-time All-American and NCAA
champion at UCLA, Abdul-Jabbar ranks first in league history for
field goals attempted and made and minutes played. He also is
second on the all-time list for blocked shots, third in rebounding
and first in fouls.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Jabbar was a 19-time NBA All-Star, two-time scoring
champion, six-time Most Valuable Player and played on six
championship teams, five with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am ecstatic that the organization has moved to support what
we are trying to accomplish in developing our young players,'' Todd
said. ''I don't feel that there can be anybody more qualified to
work with our big men.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the calling card Abdul-Jabbar presented to team owner
Donald T. Sterling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Mr. Sterling two or three years ago,''
Abdul-Jabbar said of his bid to expedite a coaching career. ``In
the interim, I had told (vice president of basketball operations
Elgin Baylor) that I was very interested in coaching.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Over the last few years, as the American Museum of
Natural History put up its sleek new planetarium on the Upper West
Side, its enormous sphere and glass walls were erected around one
of the museum's oldest treasures, a great 15-ton meteorite that
fell to Earth 10,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For almost a century, the Willamette Meteorite _ a behemoth
believed to have come from the Asteroid Belt between Mars and
Jupiter and brought to the museum from the Pacific Northwest in
1906 _ has been seen and touched by generations of awed school
children and other aficionados of the cosmic mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   But as the $210 million Rose Center for Earth and Space opens at
81st Street near Central Park West on Saturday to crowds that are
expected to swell to 4.5 million visitors a year, the destiny of
the dark, deeply gouged meteorite, seemingly secure on its steel
pedestal in the planetarium's Cullman Hall of the Universe, has
been cast into doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Acting under a federal law written for the preservation and
repatriation of Native American cultural and religious artifacts,
an Indian group in Oregon has submitted a claim for the meteorite,
saying it was a holy tribal object that brought messages from the
spirit world long before the arrival of white men.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sacred object to the people of the Willamette
Valley,'' Tracy Dugan, speaking for the Confederated Tribes of the
Grand Ronde of Oregon, said Friday. ``It was used by our ancestors.
We want to bring it back here to our reservation and make it
available for people to use in the traditional way.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum has until Feb. 29 to respond to the claim, which was
filed last Nov. 30 under the Native American Graves Protection and
Repatriation Act of 1990. The case could wind up in court and take
years to resolve, but if no settlement is reached and the claim is
eventually upheld, it would be necessary to partly dismantle the
new planetarium to get it out.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the planetarium's widely-publicized opening,
museum officials were focused not on the meteorite but on smoothing
the way for up to 18,000 visitors on Saturday, the vanguard of
crowds expected in the weeks and months ahead. Already, 100,000
advance tickets for the tour-of-the-virtual-universe shows have
been sold, although tickets for half of the seats are to be held
back for sale at the museum for each of the 14 to 20 daily
performances.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Canty, a spokeswoman for the museum, declined to comment
Friday on the claim for the meteorite. But she acknowledged that
removing it from its new home would be difficult. ``Because the
meteorite is so massive, parts of the facility had to essentially
be built around it,'' she noted.
</P>
<P>
   The Willamette Meteorite, a mass of metal and rock the size of a
small car, is thought to have plunged down in flames somewhere in
the Pacific Northwest 10 millennia ago, a gnarled monster from
space. Shifted by an Ice Age glacier, it came to rest on a hillside
in West Linn, Ore., just south of Portland.
</P>
<P>
   There, the Clackamas tribe _ one of many groups now part of the
Grand Ronde confederation _ took it to be a sacred representation
of sky, earth and water, and adopted it. They called it
``Tomanowos,'' or Sky Person. According to Dugan, rain water
collected in its craters was considered holy, and Clackamas youths
were sent on vigils to the meteorite to receive messages from the
spirit world.
</P>
<P>
   A century ago, the tribe was confined to a reservation away from
the meteorite and its use as a sacred object declined.
</P>
<P>
   In 1902, Ellis G. Hughes, a miner and farmer, discovered it on
land owned by an iron company and had it moved to his barn. He
began charging visitors 25 cents to see it. In 1905, the iron
company sued for its return and repossessed the meteorite, which
had become a local attraction.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, a visitor from New York, Mrs. William Dodge,
bought the meteorite for $20,600 and donated it to the American
Museum of Natural History. It was moved to New York and became part
of the museum's permanent collection. In 1935, when the Hayden
Planetarium opened, it became a centerpiece of its exhibit and over
the years was seen and touched by millions.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, when the museum began work on the Rose Center to
replace the old planetarium, a decision was made to incorporate a
few of the old treasures _including the meteorite and scales
showing what a person would weigh on the moon and various planets _
into the new building.
</P>
<P>
   The meteorite was so large and heavy that it had to be installed
first, in effect, and the planetarium built around it. Two years
ago, contractors sunk three steel pilings into the ground to
support its bulk, and it was swung in on a crane and mounted in a
permanent exhibition hall on the lower level.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, with the planetarium still under construction, a
half-dozen representatives of the Grand Ronde confederation visited
museums in Chicago, Boston and other cities in the East, including
the American Museum of Natural History, in search of cultural and
religious artifacts that they might have a right to claim.
</P>
<P>
   The confederation has a reservation and headquarters in Grand
Ronde, Ore., 60 miles west of Portland, and 4,500 members in five
main tribes, situated in the Willamette Valley, which stretches
south from Portland about 100 miles. The Clackamas tribe is a
subgroup of one of the five main tribes, Dugan said.
</P>
<P>
   As is true of many Native American groups, its chances of
recovering lost cultural and religious artifacts seemed hopeless
years ago, especially after many of the smaller tribes were
officially ``terminated'' by the federal government in 1954, under
an Eisenhower administration policy aimed at greater assimilation
of Indians into American culture.
</P>
<P>
   But after years of lobbying, many of the groups, including the
Grand Ronde, were officially resurrected in 1983, and in 1990 the
Native American Graves and Repatriation Act gave new hope to tribes
seeking to recover objects, including bones of ancestors and
relics, that had been sacred or culturally important.
</P>
<P>
   Under a federal grant, the delegation from Grand Ronde _ Ryan
and Adrienne Heavy Head, June Olson, Lindy Trolan and others _
visited the Natural History Museum in New York over a period of six
days, taking thousands of pictures to document objects for possible
repatriation.
</P>
<P>
   Dugan said the group was treated civilly, but encountered
resistance from museum officials when they sought to take pictures
of the Willamette Meteorite. It was in a hard-hat construction
area, they were told. But they were eventually allowed in under
supervision and took pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving the museum, the delegation filed the claim
directly with the museum on behalf of the Grand Ronde, Dugan said.
Documentary evidence to support the claim was filed with the museum
on Nov. 30, she said. Under the federal law, the museum is obliged
to respond within 90 days, which she said would elapse on Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Proof of ownership appears to be the critical issue _ the
museum's citing its acquisition of and long protective association
with the meteorite, versus the Grand Ronde's claim of ancient
tribal religious and cultural ties. The case could go to a federal
review committee or to court, and it could take years to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Or the two sides could agree to settle it, although Dugan
suggested that that was doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of Indian culture has been lost,'' she said. ``Our
people were discouraged, even forbidden, to practice their
religion. We want the meteorite back, and not some settlement.''

ONE SUSPECT CLEARED OF SETTING SINGER ON FIRE IN VOODOO RITUAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a surprise turn in an already tangled trial about a voodoo
ritual, a New Jersey judge has absolved a Brooklyn man of charges
that he and a voodoo priest tried to kill a Haitian pop singer by
setting her on fire in the ceremony in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn man, Jean Valme, 38, accepted a deal from the Essex
County prosecutor's office on Thursday and gave a statement about
the fire. The trial prosecutor, Shelton McCall, then asked Judge
Paul J. Vichness of Superior Court in Newark to drop charges of
conspiracy, attempted murder, and aggravated assault against Valme.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Sheila DeGraff, 29, of Uniondale on Long Island,
suffered second- and third-degree burns on her neck, face, and
chest.
</P>
<P>
   Vichness, who is hearing the trial without a jury, approved the
deal, leaving the voodoo priest, Pierrot Charles, 43, of Irvington,
N.J., on trial alone. Vichness also dropped a murder conspiracy
charge against Charles but let stand charges of attempted murder
and aggravated assault.
</P>
<P>
   DeGraff, who dated Valme before the fire, testified this week
that she sought Charles' help in late September 1997 because she
thought evil spirits were responsible for noises she heard in her
basement. Valme introduced her to the priest, Valme's lawyer, Jean
D. Larosiliere, has said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors would not comment on the contents of Valme's
statement. But on Thursday, Charles' lawyer, James M. Weinberg,
said he would seek dismissal of all charges against Charles when
the trial resumes on Feb. 28. He said the statement had compromised
his client's right to a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg said parts of Valme's statement contradicted details he
gave in pretrial meetings. In particular, Weinberg said, Valme had
previously said Ms. DeGraff was burned after she wiped ``Florida
water'' _ an alcohol-based cologne used in voodoo rituals _ on her
neck and then bumped into a table containing a candle.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement, Weinberg said, Valme said the fire started as
Charles was holding a candle near DeGraff as he sprinkled the
cologne on DeGraff's robe.
</P>
<P>
   But Larosiliere said Valme's statement tended to exonerate
Charles of attempted murder because Valme said nothing about
Charles' deliberately setting the fire.
</P>
<P>
   In her testimony earlier this week, DeGraff could not say
exactly how the fire started. She said Charles had poured the
cologne on her head. She closed her eyes, she said, because the
cologne stung them. Then she heard a ``whoosh'' and felt fire on
her head and face.

NEUROSURGEON AGREES TO SUSPENSION DURING INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The head of neurosurgery at Staten Island Univrsity
Hospital agreed Friday to stop practicing medicine while the New
York state Department of Health investigates the death of one of
his patients earlier this month, hospital officials said. The move
came three days after the department, citing possible danger to
patients, ordered the hospital to prohibit the doctor, Ehud Arbit,
from caring for patients while it investigated.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a preliminary investigation,'' Health Commissioner
Antonia C. Novello said Friday in a prepared statement, ``it is my
belief that there exists a potentially grave risk to patients at
the hospital in connection with surgery performed by Ehud Arbit.''
A department spokeswoman would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the hospital refused to comment Friday, as did
Arbit's lawyer, Barbara Ryan, both citing the continuing
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The department's move to keep Arbit from practicing medicine
while it investigates is unusual. The agency generally waits until
it has built a case against a doctor and tries to discipline him
only after its investigation is complete.
</P>
<P>
   But Arbit was the subject of a Health Department investigation
in 1995, when he was chief of neurosurgery at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. At that time, he mistakenly operated
on the healthy right side of the brain of Rajeswari Ayyappan, the
mother of a famous Indian film star, Sridevi Ayyappan, instead of
the left side, where a cancerous tumor was situated.
</P>
<P>
   After the error was discovered, the patient, who went to the
hospital with a very poor prognosis, had the tumor removed at
another hospital . She later died in India, and Arbit was fired
from Sloan-Kettering. But he quickly found work at Staten Island
University Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Health Department officials said they had received recent
complaints about Arbit's practice on Staten Island in more than one
case. The most serious complaint now under investigation arose from
the case of a patient who died after Arbit performed surgery on his
brain. Officials familiar with that patient's care identified him
as Johnnie Ray Artis, who died Feb. 2.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Artis' widow, Angela Coleman, said Friday that she was stunned
to hear that anything out of the ordinary might have occurred
during the hospitalization of her husband, who she said had been
``pretty sick.'' She said she had not been contacted by the state
or the hospital since his death.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said he was taken to Staten Island University Hospital
in late January because of complications from a chronic problem
with his pancreas. At first, he seemed ill but stable, she said.
``But all of the sudden he went into a semicomatose state,''
Coleman said. ``They said they had to do a CAT scan and from that
Dr. Arbit determined they had to go in and relieve the pressure on
the brain. He never woke up.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said that as painful as her husband's death was, she had
no reason to question the doctor's explanation. ``I have always
preferred Staten Island hospital,'' she added. ``I can't say why. I
had my son there. I like the care. The staff was always very nice
and seemed to care a lot when I was there and took care of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from their son, who is 17, Artis had an extended family in
North Carolina. His death ``was a shock to me,'' his brother, Jimmy
Artis, said in a telephone interview from South Carolina. ``I have
been sitting here thinking about it all day. I never knew he was
that sick. ''
</P>
<P>
   After the 1995 case in which Arbit operated on the wrong side of
Ayyappan's brain, the Health Department cited Sloan-Kettering and
fined it $12,000. The fine was later reduced to $6,000. The
hospital dismissed Arbit immediately, which he appealed and lost.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Ayyappan's surgery, Arbit's practice at
Sloan-Kettering was already under review. A Sloan-Kettering
statement then said the hospital had been evaluating the doctor's
practice and had singled out another case in which his care ``did
not meet Memorial Hospital's standards.''
</P>
<P>
   The state decided that Arbit's actions in Ayyappan's case
warranted a year's probation, which allowed him to continue
practicing medicine. He was soon appointed to head Staten Island
University Hospital's neurosurgery unit, which the hospital has
promoted heavily in radio and print advertisements over the last
few years.

N.Y. TIMES COMPANY PICKS DEVELOPER FOR A NEW HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Times Co. has taken an important step
toward creating a new headquarters in the Times Square area. It has
selected a developer to help in its negotiations with state and
city officials to build a 1.37 million-square-foot tower across
from the Port Authority Bus Terminal, according to the company and
government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The company picked Bruce Ratner, president of Forest City Ratner
Cos., which built the Metroplex office complex in downtown
Brooklyn, from among five competing developers for the job. If a
deal could be struck with the city and the state, the proposed
tower would rise about 40 stories on Eighth Avenue, between 40th
and 41st Streets, and become The Times' third home in the Times
Square area in 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Times Co. did not identify the proposed site for the
skyscraper, but real-estate executives said it was a parcel at
Eighth Avenue and 40th Street, which sits within the borders of the
Times Square redevelopment project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased to take this step, although it's not a
commitment to build,'' Michael Golden, vice chairman of the
company, said Friday in a statement. ``It's an exploration to
acquire development rights. However, one way or another, we are
committed to finding a solution to our need for appropriate space
for our staff. If we don't build, another option is to renovate our
current building.''
</P>
<P>
   The new headquarters would allow the company to consolidate its
operations, now spread among a half-dozen buildings, including the
87-year-old headquarters on 43rd Street. If the project goes
forward, the company plans to sell that building.
</P>
<P>
   The company would take up to 900,000 square feet of space in the
new tower, while placing the newsroom on three floors at the base
of the building. The remaining space would be leased to tenants.
</P>
<P>
   In negotiations with state and city officials, the company has
said that it would have to move hundreds of employees to a building
in Edison, N.J., unless it obtained tax breaks to build the tower,
according to people involved in the talks. In the opening stages of
negotiations, the company told city officials that it was willing
to make annual payments of about one-third of the city's current
property tax rate and to create a substantial public amenity,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The city has yet to make a counterproposal.

 OPEN PRIMARY A SORE POINT FOR S.C. GOP   
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This elegant port city plays host Saturday to both a critical
Republican pres idential primary and a huge wild life expo.
</P>
<P>
   That means Charleston is crawling not only with reptiles but
Democrats of all stripes _ creatures that many Palmetto State
Republicans find equally repugnant and out of place, at least in a
GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
   To carry the primary, John McCain is banking on the very
Democrats and independents who have provoked a Republican civil war
in South Carolina, where the actual War Between the States began
140 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are Democrats who wouldn't vote for the Lord him self
(in November) if he was a Republican,'' drawled state Rep. Bob
Leach of Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes couldn't be higher for McCain and rival George W.
Bush, who is trying to regain his footing after being routed by the
Arizona senator in the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We win tomorrow _ and we will win _ there is no way we can be
stopped,'' McCain said during a pep rally here Friday, which
featured thumping rock music in a gymnasium overflow ing with
College of Charleston students and other supporters.
</P>
<P>
   From here, McCain moves to Michigan and Arizona, which both hold
primaries Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Polls have Bush with a huge advantage among South Caroli na's
registered Republicans, but the Texas governor has a much narrower
lead when potential voters registered as Democrats or independents
are factored in.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is candid about his appeal to the sort of blue-collar
Democrats who helped elect Re publican Ronald Reagan to two
presidential terms in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't govern in America if you're an exclusive party,''
McCain told the college students Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Leach, the state represent ative, said in a telephone inter
view that it's downright blasphemous that Democrats and
independents are permitted to vote for McCain Saturday, then cast
ballots for a Democrat in Novem ber's general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it bother me? It bothers me enough so that I introduced a
bill in the House yesterday'' to restrict the 2004 primary to Re
publicans, said Leach, 67, a state legislator for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   To Leach, the state party is diminishing its stature and
watering down its identity by letting others vote Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Leach said McCain is a classic Washington politico with a ``dev
il-may-care attitude,'' as evi denced by his scolding from a Senate
committee for intervening with federal banking regulators in behalf
of Phoenix financier Charles H Keating Jr., a major campaign
contributor.
</P>
<P>
   The skirmish over primary rules was on display on the sidewalk
outside McCain's rally, where several McCain protesters got into
shouting matches with the senator's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Briggs, who said he was for ``anyone but McCain'' wore a
placard around his neck featur ing a magazine cover with Mc Cain's
photo and the words, ``This man is not a Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Briggs handed out fliers read ing, ``Democrats have the op
portunity to pick the Republican nominee!''
</P>
<P>
   Doris Powell, a Charleston reg istered nurse, watched Briggs
with an amused look on her face. She described herself as an inde
pendent who usually votes Demo cratic. She plans to vote Saturday
for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like his background,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In his pitches for such cross over supporters, McCain is striv
ing for nothing less than a new Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   On issues ranging from abor tion to the environment, McCain is
advocating positions with mainstream appeal. He's running against
conventional wisdom dic tating that GOP candidates must cater to
social and religious con servative activists who once dominated the
primary elections.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, with his ``straight talk'' and war-hero background, is
instead catering to political novices who have been alienated by
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Americans don't wake up and say, `I am a Republican,' or,
`I am a Democrat,' '' said U.S. Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz., who has
been traveling with McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at (the late Arizona Sen.) Barry Goldwater, who was a
Republican icon,'' Shadegg said. ``Barry Goldwater never would have
been in the Senate without crossover votes.'' &QL;

 MILES WHITE, 85, BROADWAY COSTUME DESIGNER

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Miles White, the imaginative costume designer for
Rodgers and Hammerstein's first two Broadway hits, ``Oklahoma!''
and ``Carousel,'' and dozens of other musicals as well as movies,
ballets, ice shows and circuses, died on Thursday. He was 85 and
lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In a career that extended through seven decades, White showed
extraordinary diversity, moving freely among periods, places and
modes of dress, working equally well with cowboys and showgirls,
circus roustabouts and rock stars (in ``Bye Bye Birdie'') and both
the gentlemen and the blondes in ``Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.''
</P>
<P>
   His greatest early challenge was ``Oklahoma!'' in 1943. Faced
with the prospect of designing costumes for cowhands and farmers at
the turn of the century, he said: ``I simply didn't know how to do
it. I didn't want to do it. I tried to say no.''
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a mail-order catalog of the period, he found
the kind of outfits people in Oklahoma might have ordered. To that
he added a certain stylization and a measure of satire, ``pointing
up what Agnes de Mille was doing with the dances,'' and
complementing Lemuel Ayers' scenery to create ``an American
primitive style.''
</P>
<P>
   Theresa Helburn, a producer of the show for the Theater Guild,
cited the costume highlights: ``Laurey's wedding gown, Ado Annie's
gay pink flounces, the checkerboard suit of Ali Hakim, the peddler:
all those warm blends of color and grace, which would cause such
gasps of delight.''
</P>
<P>
   White was born in Oakland, Calif., and attended the University
of California at Berkeley. When he could not find work in Hollywood
he came to New York, and his theatricality led him naturally to
Broadway. He made his debut in 1938 with the costumes for ``Right
This Way,'' a show with music by Sammy Fain, immediately followed
by uncredited designs for the Cole Porter musical ``You Never
Know.''
</P>
<P>
   While White was designing costumes at the Copacabana, George
Abbott hired him for ``Best Foot Forward.'' Diversifying his
palette, he also did ice shows for Sonja Henie, Ringling Brothers
and Barnum &AMP; Bailey and ``The Pirate'' for Alfred Lunt and Lynn
Fontanne. In 1943 he did four shows, including the ``Ziegfeld
Follies'' (with Milton Berle) and ``Oklahoma!'' Two years later he
again worked with Rodgers and Hammerstein, creating the New England
costumes for ``Carousel.''
</P>
<P>
   His work with the circus led to the Cecil B. de Mille movie
``The Greatest Show on Earth,'' for which he received the first of
three Academy Award nominations. The others were for ``There's No
Business Like Show Business'' and Mike Todd's ``Around the World in
80 Days.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading ladies wearing White costumes included Tallulah
Bankhead, Carol Channing, Bette Davis and Lena Horne. He won Tony
awards for the Harold Rome revue ``Bless You All'' in 1950 and Jule
Styne's ``Hazel Flagg'' in 1953. Among his other shows were
``Bloomer Girl,'' ``The Day Before Spring,'' ``Jamaica,'' ``Take Me
Along'' and ``The Unsinkable Molly Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   His last Broadway show was ``Tricks'' in 1973, but as musicals
were revived, the productions occasionally reproduced his costumes.
This was also the case with ``Fall River Legend'' for the American
Ballet Theater. In 1989 he redesigned the ``High Button Shoes''
number for ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   White's costume sketches are in many museums, including the
Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum
of the City of New York.
</P>
<P>
   No immediate family members survive.
</P>
<P>
   In her book, ``Theater in America,'' Mary C. Henderson commented
on how White's designs were molded by both dance and the circus.
``His costumes are constructed to move with the performer's body,
not an easy feat,'' she said. After ``Oklahoma!,'' she noted, he
``dominated musical comedy costuming for more than 25 years.''

 MCCAIN STRATEGY CONFUSING ARIZONANS  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What happens when a U.S. senator known for his aggressive
conservatism decides to run for president as a Teddy Roosevelt
progressive?
</P>
<P>
   Well, confusion at home, for one thing. Arizona's politics of
the 21st century are not so much a brave as a skewed new world.
</P>
<P>
   Former state Attorney General Grant Woods, a one-time McCain
staffer, recalls with wonder how he was cast out of the senator's
inner circle when he began em bracing views more liberal than
McCain would allow.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Woods watches with amazement as McCain appropri ates his
style.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's stealing my act,'' Woods joked. ``But I thought he didn't
like my act.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods believes McCain has made a calculated decision to cast off
his conservative robes and run nationally as an in dependent
outsider when it ap pears to benefit him politically.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, while cam paigning in conservative areas such
as South Carolina, McCain can point to his non-liberal voting
record in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he tries to pull it off is to talk about his voting
record to the conservatives while speak ing moderate tones to
everyone else,'' Woods said. ``It's a little tricky, but it seems
to be work ing.''
</P>
<P>
   If the strategy is working nationally, it may have a price at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Arizona politicians have to choose which John Mc
Cain and which George W. Bush they want to support. Bush may be the
conservative alternative to McCain nationally, but in Arizona he is
running as the moderate alternative to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   That's why a moderate GOP governor like Jane Hull can sup port
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But if the moderates are sup porting Bush, what happened to Rep.
Carolyn Allen of Scottsdale, an ally of the governor and one of the
leaders of the ``mushroom coalition'' in the Arizona House? She is
supporting McCain.
</P>
<P>
   And if the conservatives are supporting McCain, why are all five
of Arizona's GOP congress men cutting and running from him on all
of his major issues _ tax cuts, the budget surplus, Social Security
and the big one, campaign finance reform. On virtually all of those
issues, the state's congressmen support the policies of George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   `PEOPLE MAY BE PUZZLED'
</P>
<P>
   Allen concedes that the whole thing may be confusing to those
who take politics at face value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona is a very conserva tive state,'' Allen said. ``And
people may be puzzled. But I'm not puzzled. . . . John has a grasp
of the big picture, and he has had to step up and look at the big
picture and not the microcosm that is Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen is not alone. Other mod erate Republicans in the Legisla
ture, such as Sue Gerard, who have had rocky relations with
McCain's aides in the past now gush about his presidential cam
paign.
</P>
<P>
   It's all crystal-clear as well to a firebrand conservative like
Mayor Sam Steiger of Prescott, a Bush supporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that John believes in big government, and I
find that anathema,'' said Steiger, a former aide to McCain. ``Bush
looks like the best chance at a smaller-government approach of any
of the candidates that are left.''
</P>
<P>
   TIME-HONORED TRADITION Another certain voice belongs to Rep. Bob
Stump, R-Ariz., who has watched McCain operate in Con gress the
longest. Stump, who is the sole dissenter from the Mc Cain
candidacy in the state GOP delegation, said there is little doubt
that McCain has moved to the left, following a time-honored
tradition in politics of running to the center to satisfy a broader
base of voters.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Stump said, Mc Cain's maneuver has netted him the
support of Independents and some Democrats in states such as South
Carolina and Michigan, which allow crossover votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to modify their positions to run for office,'' said
Stump, who has not endorsed any presidential candidate. ``That's
what he's doing out there, and I don't think there's any question
about it. I'm not going to be modifying my positions to ap pease
anyone out there, and that's probably why you won't ever see me run
for Senate or president.''
</P>
<P>
   Stump said McCain's strength so far may be ``misleading'' be
cause it is built on his appeal to a blend of voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get into some of these closed states like Arizona or
California, and there you are going to get a better view of the
situation,'' Stump said.
</P>
<P>
   OPPOSE OTHER EFFORTS Most of the delegation is also opposed to
McCain's other major crusade, campaign finance re form. They have
also found little to like in McCain's efforts in the Senate to levy
new taxes on the tobacco industry, a position he has not backed
away from during his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   One campaign observer said the dissonance between McCain and his
colleagues in Congress should not come as a surprise. Although
McCain is running a campaign geared toward Inde pendents and even
some Demo crats, congressmen must remain faithful to their
conservative con stituents.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., sug gested that voters are less inter
ested in McCain's positions on issues than in his life story. In
fact, aides to Steve Forbes, who had based his campaign on con
servative issues and attracted a number of influential conserva
tives in the state, later said they had no chance against McCain's
biography-driven campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not what this primary election is about; it's not
about campaign finance reform or taxes or the affordability of pre
scription drug or HMOs,'' Kolbe said. ``The American people have
decided they want somebody with character and integrity, and that
is what is making John McCain so popular.'' &QL;

<P>
   `PEOPLE MAY BE PUZZLED'
</P>
<P>
   Allen concedes that the whole thing may be confusing to those
who take politics at face value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona is a very conserva tive state,'' Allen said. ``And
people may be puzzled. But I'm not puzzled. . . . John has a grasp
of the big picture, and he has had to step up and look at the big
picture and not the microcosm that is Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen is not alone. Other mod erate Republicans in the Legisla
ture, such as Sue Gerard, who have had rocky relations with
McCain's aides in the past now gush about his presidential cam
paign.
</P>
<P>
   It's all crystal-clear as well to a firebrand conservative like
Mayor Sam Steiger of Prescott, a Bush supporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that John believes in big government, and I
find that anathema,'' said Steiger, a former aide to McCain. ``Bush
looks like the best chance at a smaller-government approach of any
of the candidates that are left.''
</P>
<P>
   TIME-HONORED TRADITION Another certain voice belongs to Rep. Bob
Stump, R-Ariz., who has watched McCain operate in Con gress the
longest. Stump, who is the sole dissenter from the Mc Cain
candidacy in the state GOP delegation, said there is little doubt
that McCain has moved to the left, following a time-honored
tradition in politics of running to the center to satisfy a broader
base of voters.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Stump said, Mc Cain's maneuver has netted him the
support of Independents and some Democrats in states such as South
Carolina and Michigan, which allow crossover votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to modify their positions to run for office,'' said
Stump, who has not endorsed any presidential candidate. ``That's
what he's doing out there, and I don't think there's any question
about it. I'm not going to be modifying my positions to ap pease
anyone out there, and that's probably why you won't ever see me run
for Senate or president.''
</P>
<P>
   Stump said McCain's strength so far may be ``misleading'' be
cause it is built on his appeal to a blend of voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get into some of these closed states like Arizona or
California, and there you are going to get a better view of the
situation,'' Stump said.
</P>
<P>
   OPPOSE OTHER EFFORTS Most of the delegation is also opposed to
McCain's other major crusade, campaign finance re form. They have
also found little to like in McCain's efforts in the Senate to levy
new taxes on the tobacco industry, a position he has not backed
away from during his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   One campaign observer said the dissonance between McCain and his
colleagues in Congress should not come as a surprise. Although
McCain is running a campaign geared toward Inde pendents and even
some Demo crats, congressmen must remain faithful to their
conservative con stituents.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., sug gested that voters are less inter
ested in McCain's positions on issues than in his life story. In
fact, aides to Steve Forbes, who had based his campaign on con
servative issues and attracted a number of influential conserva
tives in the state, later said they had no chance against McCain's
biography-driven campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not what this primary election is about; it's not
about campaign finance reform or taxes or the affordability of pre
scription drug or HMOs,'' Kolbe said. ``The American people have
decided they want somebody with character and integrity, and that
is what is making John McCain so popular.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Emery cargo loading to get close look
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney and Wes Hills
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The National Transportation Safety Board will
look into pilots' allegations of cargo-loading problems at Emery
Worldwide Airlines as part of its investigation into Wednesday's
fatal crash of an Emery DC-8 near Sacramento, Calif., a spokesman
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A loading problem is just one of many possibilities the NTSB is
exploring as a factor in the cargo jet's fiery crash Wednesday into
an auto salvage yard shortly after takeoff, board spokesman Paul
Schlamm said. The plane was en route to Emery's cargo hub at Dayton
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The crash killed all three crew members.
</P>
<P>
   ``In cargo accidents you normally would look at loading issues,
particularly when it appears to be a problem with control of the
aircraft,'' Schlamm said. On Thursday, the Federal Aviation
Administration said the airplane's captain declared an emergency
and radioed that he was having ``extreme center of gravity
problems'' with the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Cargo jets typically carry their freight loaded in large metal
containers called ``igloos'' or ``huts'' that are secured to the
deck with heavy clamps. How the weight is distributed in the
airplane's cargo hold can affect where its center of gravity, or
balance point, is located, an Emery pilot said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Emery Capt. Mark Luthi said pilots depend on paperwork from the
cargo loaders to tell them how to set flight controls before
takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   If the load is too far out of balance, ``You may just not have
enough control to do anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we (lift the nose up for takeoff), the aircraft should be
in trim. Sometimes you'll take off and have to start retrimming the
airplane drastically and that means your load was not correct. It's
not that infrequent. I've had to retrim an airplane a few times,
drastically retrim it,'' Luthi said.
</P>
<P>
   Schlamm said NTSB ``is aware'' of a document being circulated by
the Emery pilots' union, the Air Line Pilots Association, alleging
cargo loading problems at Emery.
</P>
<P>
   Cargo loading is one of many concerns Emery pilots have raised
with FAA safety inspectors, according to records obtained by the
Cox Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The records include internal Emery ``flight debrief'' reports by
pilots, reports submitted to the pilots' union, the Air Line Pilots
Association, and letters to FAA inspectors and executives with
Emery and its parent company, CNF Transportation Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The company and the union are negotiating their first labor
contract.
</P>
<P>
   An ALPA ``Report on Emery Worldwide Airlines Operational Flight
Safety,'' which the union submitted to FAA inspectors last
September, alleges that improper loading has caused control
problems on the airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Emery planes are ``dangerously misloaded,'' the report says. The
company's planes have ``encountered control and performance
problems due to incorrect cargo weights, improper center of gravity
locations, and freight shifting in flight, etc., all of which could
have easily resulted in a catastrophic loss of aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   In one case, according to pilots' reports, cargo containers on a
plane were thousands of pounds heavier than their paperwork said
because the scale used to weigh them had been damaged by a
forklift.
</P>
<P>
   In another, the weight figure on a U.S. Customs form was changed
to match the figure on the captain's form, leaving him to wonder
which weight was correct.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has been investigating some cargo-handling incidents for
a year after conducting what it calls a ``regional airline safety
inspection'' in February 1999 at Emery's main North American
freight hub in Dayton, but it has declined to release details of
the incidents.

 &HT;    EPA to close popular site
 &HT;    By Dale Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's
decision Thursday to temporarily shut down its well-surfed Web site
has drawn criticism from environmental groups and others.
</P>
<P>
   The site was shut down by EPA Administrator Carol Browner
following questions about its vulnerability to hackers. U.S. Rep.
Thomas Bliley, head of the Commerce Committee, made public a
General Accounting Office report that said the EPA's computer
system is ``riddled with security weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. EPA has said that it expects the Web site to be back up
and running next week after the agency addresses the security
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is just a few days, that's no problem,'' said Richard
Wiles, R. Va., of the Environmental Working Group in Washington,
D.C. ``If it becomes permanent, that would be a serious issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. EPA, one of the pioneers in providing public
information on the Internet, provides an immense amount of data
from statistics on air pollution, toxic chemical releases,
pesticides, pollution levels in lakes and streams, health studies
and records of enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site (www.epa.gov) has been extensively used by
environmental groups, researchers, journalists, political activists
and the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to cause incredible problems,'' said Allen
Burton, head of the Center for Environmental Studies at Wright
State University. ``There is so much good information on it. We use
it two or three times a week.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction provides another reminder of how quickly the
Internet has emerged as an essential information-gathering tool for
individuals and groups of all types. The information collected on
the Web site is still available in paper reports and press
releases, but the Internet made it possible to quickly gather and
assess the material.
</P>
<P>
   Industries, led by the chemical industry, have been lobbying to
restrict access to information on the Internet for several years.

 &HT;    Colleges to call home over drug, alcohol abuse
 &HT;    By Stephen Kiehl
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ In the war on drug and alcohol abuse on
campuses, Florida's colleges have a new weapon: Parents.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to curb the substance-abuse culture in college, the 10
state universities will notify parents when students repeatedly
violate drug or alcohol rules or put their health and safety in
danger.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Regents on Friday directed universities to draw up
such notification policies with the goal of putting them into
effect this fall. Just having one beer won't mean a call home,
regents said. But continuing abuse will.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we have two universities in the top 10 party schools, we
should try to change that image,'' said Regent Steven Uhlfelder of
Tallahassee, sponsor of the measure. ``We need parents to know
what's going on and take some responsibility when their children
abuse alcohol or drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The rule is not supposed to punish students, nor do regents
expect to stamp out drinking entirely. But they hope parents will
help them cut down on the binge drinking that has led to rapes and
deaths on Florida campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges also will step up drug and alcohol education and
counseling, and the regents have asked the legislature for $2
million this year to hire more substance-abuse counselors.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's policy is modeled on plans that have had success in
other states. At the University of Delaware, an
automatic-notification policy on first offenses has reduced dorm
vandalism, fraternity disciplinary cases and the number of students
hospitalized for alcohol overdoses.
</P>
<P>
   Regents had originally considered a policy as strict as
Delaware's but decided to back away from such a rigid rule after
students complained about an invasion of their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   For years, colleges had feared the same thing. Federal privacy
laws had prevented colleges from notifying parents except in the
most serious circumstances. But in 1998, Congress approved
legislation that explicitly allowed colleges to call parents when
students under 21 commit alcohol or drug violations.
</P>
<P>
   Florida schools will notify only parents of students who are
under 21 and dependent. But figuring out who's dependent could be a
real headache for colleges. They could check financial aid records,
but not all students get aid. University officials may ask the
legislature this year to conform Florida's law with the federal law
to make parental-notification easier.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is not to make university administrators surrogate
parents but to get parents to help their kids even after they've
left home, regents said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that kids are going to drink,'' Uhlfelder said.
``But they should drink responsibly, and universities have some
obligation to make sure students aren't getting hurt.''

OPEN PRIMARY A SORE POINT FOR S.C. GOP  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This elegant port city plays host Saturday to both a critical
Republican pres idential primary and a huge wild life expo.
</P>
<P>
   That means Charleston is crawling not only with reptiles but
Democrats of all stripes _ creatures that many Palmetto State
Republicans find equally repugnant and out of place, at least in a
GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
   To carry the primary, John McCain is banking on the very
Democrats and independents who have provoked a Republican civil war
in South Carolina, where the actual War Between the States began
140 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are Democrats who wouldn't vote for the Lord him self
(in November) if he was a Republican,'' drawled state Rep. Bob
Leach of Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes couldn't be higher for McCain and rival George W.
Bush, who is trying to regain his footing after being routed by the
Arizona senator in the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We win tomorrow _ and we will win _ there is no way we can be
stopped,'' McCain said during a pep rally here Friday, which
featured thumping rock music in a gymnasium overflow ing with
College of Charleston students and other supporters.
</P>
<P>
   From here, McCain moves to Michigan and Arizona, which both hold
primaries Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Polls have Bush with a huge advantage among South Caroli na's
registered Republicans, but the Texas governor has a much narrower
lead when potential voters registered as Democrats or independents
are factored in.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is candid about his appeal to the sort of blue-collar
Democrats who helped elect Re publican Ronald Reagan to two
presidential terms in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't govern in America if you're an exclusive party,''
McCain told the college students Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Leach, the state represent ative, said in a telephone inter
view that it's downright blasphemous that Democrats and
independents are permitted to vote for McCain Saturday, then cast
ballots for a Democrat in Novem ber's general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it bother me? It bothers me enough so that I introduced a
bill in the House yesterday'' to restrict the 2004 primary to Re
publicans, said Leach, 67, a state legislator for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   To Leach, the state party is diminishing its stature and
watering down its identity by letting others vote Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Leach said McCain is a classic Washington politico with a ``dev
il-may-care attitude,'' as evi denced by his scolding from a Senate
committee for intervening with federal banking regulators in behalf
of Phoenix financier Charles H Keating Jr., a major campaign
contributor.
</P>
<P>
   The skirmish over primary rules was on display on the sidewalk
outside McCain's rally, where several McCain protesters got into
shouting matches with the senator's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Briggs, who said he was for ``anyone but McCain'' wore a
placard around his neck featur ing a magazine cover with Mc Cain's
photo and the words, ``This man is not a Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Briggs handed out fliers read ing, ``Democrats have the op
portunity to pick the Republican nominee!''
</P>
<P>
   Doris Powell, a Charleston reg istered nurse, watched Briggs
with an amused look on her face. She described herself as an inde
pendent who usually votes Demo cratic. She plans to vote Saturday
for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like his background,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In his pitches for such cross over supporters, McCain is striv
ing for nothing less than a new Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   On issues ranging from abor tion to the environment, McCain is
advocating positions with mainstream appeal. He's running against
conventional wisdom dic tating that GOP candidates must cater to
social and religious con servative activists who once dominated the
primary elections.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, with his ``straight talk'' and war-hero background, is
instead catering to political novices who have been alienated by
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Americans don't wake up and say, `I am a Republican,' or,
`I am a Democrat,' '' said U.S. Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz., who has
been traveling with McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at (the late Arizona Sen.) Barry Goldwater, who was a
Republican icon,'' Shadegg said. ``Barry Goldwater never would have
been in the Senate without crossover votes.'' &QL;

A DAY'S WORK: GOLF, GRIEF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Stuart Appleby's work was done by noon on Friday.
The afternoon stretched before him like a long par-5 after he
signed his scorecard for a second-round 3-under-par 68 at the
Nissan Open.
</P>
<P>
   So began the real grind for the Australian golfer. Trust him,
it's not easy filling in the rest of a sunny Southern California
day without the memories rolling in like fog.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen months have passed since Appleby's wife Renay died in
his arms after getting crushed between a taxi and another car in
London, where the couple had retreated for a second honeymoon after
he missed the cut in the 1998 British Open.
</P>
<P>
   Appleby, 29, has posted six top-10 finishes since then,
including an emotional victory at the Houston Open last May and a
second-place showing behind Paul Azinger at the Hawaiian Open last
month.
</P>
<P>
   He has earned just under $2 million on the tour since then. He
has secured his position as one of the tour's rising stars since
then. And yet he remains less identifiable by any of his successes
than for that single day of unspeakable sadness.
</P>
<P>
   ``See that golfer there,'' said one spectator, nudging his
friend and pointing to Appleby as the golfer stalked the seventh
green at Riviera Country Club. ``That's the guy whose wife was
killed in the car accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Appleby's caddy Joe Damiano wasn't surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear it every week,'' Damiano said after watching Appleby
occupy an hour beating a bucket of balls on the practice range
after his round. ``He hears it too.''
</P>
<P>
   What's a grieving guy to do? There's no primer on how to pull
through after your heart's been torn out of your chest. Appleby is
writing the book as he goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very crux of it, the first 12 months is very difficult,''
Appleby said. ``And maybe at two years is just the beginning of the
(healing) process.''
</P>
<P>
   If Appleby is hurting, he isn't showing any of his peers the
open wound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuey carries himself so well it's amazing,'' said fellow
Australian Craig Spence. ``He seems to talk about Renay a lot,
which is good, I think. It must be still horrific for him to deal
with her death.''
</P>
<P>
   The necklace with his wife's name on it that Appleby once wore
like a tan wasn't in plain view Thursday. The only accessory that
really stood out was his putter, which was solid gold. He took just
25 strokes with it while fashioning his three-birdie, no-bogey
round.
</P>
<P>
   Appleby stands 4-under par at the midway point, five strokes
behind countryman Greg Chalmers and Bob Tway. ``You always wish you
could have squeezed more out of the round,'' Appleby said, ``but I
was playing good, solid golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Damiano said he has noticed a subtle change in Appleby since the
start of the calendar year, that has nothing (and who knows, maybe
everything) to do with Appleby's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he went through, I don't think it's something a person
ever forgets,'' Damiano said. ``But he's learned to go forward. He
seemed to turn the corner around the first of the year. Every day
he's getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   Appleby is hard not to like, which has made it easy for his
fellow pros to rally around him. They invite him to dinner, take
turns taking his emotional pulse. ``At the end of the day, we're
all like one big family,'' Appleby said.
</P>
<P>
   Payne Stewart, in particular, was as close as kin to Appleby.
When Appleby joined the tour in 1996 after graduating with honors
from the mini tour, Stewart was among the first to invite him along
on practice rounds. He dispensed advice and wisecracks in equal
doses and made the other side of the world feel like home to
Appleby.
</P>
<P>
   When Stewart died in a freak airplane accident in October,
Appleby knew just what to do. Death, after all, was no longer a
stranger to him. ``It probably made it a little easier for me,
having just gone through what I did,'' he said. ``I had a better
understanding of what the situation was.''
</P>
<P>
   Appleby asked Stewart's wife Tracy for permission to sift
through Stewart's closet. He came across plus-fours with the
manufacturer's tags still attached and a matching shirt that also
appeared never to have been worn.
</P>
<P>
   That was the outfit Appleby donned a few days later at the
season-ending Tour championship in Texas that had been the final
destination of Stewart's ill-fated flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne certainly was what we all should aim to be,'' said
Appleby, who looked so much like Stewart it was at once soothing
and a little spooky.
</P>
<P>
   With the ``Renay'' gold necklace dangling from his neck and the
material bunched just below his knees, Appleby's pain and poise
were in plain view. That's the memory people took from the week,
not that Appleby finished in a tie for 26th.
</P>
<P>
   He goes into this weekend in a logjam at 24th with, among
others, Tiger Woods. If anybody would appear to have more reason to
be distracted than media magnet Woods, it's Appleby. But as he left
the course he seemed to have a sound strategy for the rest of his
day. He had laundry to do, a few weights to lift, some telephone
calls to make. And after that, dinner and maybe a movie.
</P>
<P>
   If only the hole in Appleby's heart could be filled as easily as
the one in his day.

<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ The man who has come to symbolize the Los
Angeles Dodgers in the '90s should be around Chavez Ravine for the
first half of the '00s.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros, the fan-favorite first baseman who should become
Los Angeles' all-time home run hitter this season, was rewarded for
the best season of his career with a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   He signed a three-year extension with a club option for the 2004
season late Thursday night. The deal guarantees Karros $24 million
and could pay him as much as $32 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt Eric represents the Dodgers in so many
ways,'' Dodgers managing general partner and CEO Bob Daly said.
``Forget his unbelievable talent as a player. It's just what he
stands for and the way he's handled himself in his whole career. It
was one of our first priorities, to sit down and work out an
extension with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Karros, 32, established career highs by hitting .304 and driving
in 112 runs, and tied a career high with 34 homers. He's 17 home
runs shy of tying Ron Cey's L.A. Dodgers career mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of November when I had lunch at Mr. Daly's house,
he point-blank asked me if I wanted to be a Dodger or if I didn't
want to be a Dodger,'' said Karros, who has averaged 31 homers and
104 RBI the last five seasons. ``I had made up my mind I wanted to
be a Dodger, and that I hoped to continue my career here in Los
Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   And at least for the next two years, Karros won't have to deal
with the trade rumors that have followed him seemingly forever. A
no-trade clause is written into the deal. It covers the 2000
season, which pays him $5 million in the final year of his current
contract, and the first year of the extension.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Karros would usually have veto power of any trade as
a player with 10 years experience, including five with one club.
However, sources said Karros waived that right for the 2002 and
2003 seasons, and the option year.
</P>
<P>
   The extension pays him $7 million, $6.5 million and $8 million
annually. The option is for $9 million with a $1 million buyout.
The option is vested if Karros has 500 plate appearances in the
2003 season. He has reached that total in seven of his eight
seasons with the Dodgers. He received a $1.5 million signing bonus
and will donate up to $500,000 to area organizations during the
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real happy Eric's coming back,'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said. ``He, to me, is a grinder. I like guys that grind,
that are constantly working at it. He's a very stabilizing
influence.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers now have one off-field distraction looming
</P>
<P>
   the Adrian Beltre case. But that could be concluded before it
reaches a hearing. While Daly continues to say figures haven't been
exchanged, he said he's talked about the dilemma with Beltre's
agent, Scott Boras.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, sources said the Dodgers are willing to sign Beltre
to a multi-year deal to have the players association drop its
grievance. Those figures could pay the third baseman in the
neighborhood of $5 million for three years, a source said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, signing Karros means the Dodgers have three potential free
agents after the season. Neither Darren Dreifort nor Todd
Hollandsworth are expected to sign with the Dodgers during the
season. Meanwhile, catcher Todd Hundley becomes a free agent after
the season, the remnants of a $500,000 buyout of a $6 million
option for the 2001 season. The buyout agreement took place
December 1998.

IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL IS CHARGED AS SPY FOR CUBAN GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (CORRECTS lede, pronounciation in 2nd graf; CHANGES ``fled'' to
``left'' in 2nd graf; DELETES ``special'' in 9th graf) (HLW) 
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A high-ranking U.S. immigration official was charged in
federal court on Friday with spying for the Cuban government, after
federal officials say he was caught in an elaborate sting passing
on what he thought was classified information about a Cuban's plan
to defect to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Mariano M. Faget, (pronounced fah-HAY) who was born in
Havana and left Cuba in his teens, is a senior official in the
Miami field office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Faget, who is 54, was arrested here late Thursday. The immigration
service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation say they caught him
last week passing along to an otherwise unidentified ``Cuban-born
New York businessman'' false information they had fed him about a
Cuban intelligence agent's plan to defect to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Faget was charged with violations of the Espionage Act and lying
to federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   Private individuals have been convicted of spying for Cuba, but
federal officials said they knew of no prior instance of an arrest
of American government official.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here for 24 years,'' said Terry Nelson, an FBI
spokesman, ``and I can't recall ever arresting a government
official _ especially an official with such access to immigrant
records.''
</P>
<P>
   As section chief for adjudications and the third-ranking officer
in the Miami office, Faget had access to classified files and the
authority to treat applications for political asylum. Thus he was
in a position to tell Havana of the plans of Cuban nationals to
defect and subject them to retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is continuing and officials said they did not
know of defections Faget might have blocked. ``It's too early to
tell if he did any damage, or what kind of damage he did,'' said
Carlos Zaldivar, a lawyer in the Miami office of the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Faget, who was scheduled to retire in March, made a telephone
call, recorded by the FBI, on Feb. 14 to the New York businessman,
then visiting Beijing. In the call, Faget said he had nothing new
to report about the Cuban spy.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit filed with the charges against Faget, Joe
Franklin, a agent for the FBI in Miami, wrote: ``The businessman
concluded the call by asking Faget, `You're still not leaving until
next month, right?' Faget answered, `Until next month. Yes. We have
time.'''
</P>
<P>
   The arrest is likely to stir the pot of Cuban-American
relations, already boiling because of the custody battle over
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, who survived his mother's drowning when
she fled Cuba with him in November. Elian's relatives here are
fighting in court for custody against the wishes of his father in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I found out about this, I laughed,'' said Jose Basulto,
president of Brothers to the Rescue, a Cuban exile group that
supports the relatives. ``I'm sure there are many more spies out
there, hundreds, even thousands. This should really come in handy
for Elian's situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The cases are unrelated and investigation of Faget began more
than a year ago, the officials said. Maria Cardona, a spokeswoman
for the immigration service, said Faget ``has never been involved
in the Elian Gonzalez case.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference here and in a court affidavit, immigration
and FBI officials and U.S. Attorney Thomas E. Scott described a
year of investigating Faget after suspicions were raised by a
routine investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, investigators say, they observed Faget meeting with a
Cuban intelligence officer for 90 minutes at Pitchers Bar at the
Miami Marriott Hotel and with a second officer for two hours in a
secluded area of the lobby of the Hilton Hotel in Miami. Faget
never disclosed the meetings to his superiors, the investigators
reported. He also was not authorized to meet the agents on
immigration service business, but the government did not report
whether the men discussed immigration matters.
</P>
<P>
   If found guilty on all the charges, he faces at least 10 years
in prison and a $250,000 fine. Faget, who is being held in the
Federal Detention Center here, could not be reached for comment,
and no one answered the phone at his home. A woman at the office of
his lawyer, Joel Kaplan, said Kaplan was unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Faget spent 34 years with the immigration service, climbing the
ranks from an entry level clerical job. In 1971, official records
show, he married Pitty Sanchez, who is also called Maria and is 52.
To all appearances, they live modestly in a white, two-story tract
house in the Amaretto subdivision in Kendall, southwest of Miami.
They bought the house in July 1998 for $134,000 and took a mortgage
of $107,000.
</P>
<P>
   Late on Friday, a green Hyundai sedan was parked in the
driveway, and The Miami Herald had not been retrieved from the
lawn. Children skating in the cul-de-sac said they often saw a man
and woman coming and going but that the couple exchanged no more
than the occasional greeting.

GLITCH HAS AMWEST CLIENTS FUMING IN `REFUGEE CAMP'

   (Phoenix) - America West still was scram bling Friday to recover
from a computer glitch that delayed 130 flights over the past two
days, irritated more than 2,000 travel ers and turned Phoenix Sky
Har bor International Airport into a refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   Although America West handed out 1,500 hotel vouchers Thursday
night, about a thousand travelers chose to camp out over night in
Terminal 4.
</P>
<P>
   The one bright spot in the ordeal was that the Phoenix Fire
Department came to the rescue with water, blankets, pillows, candy
bars and hamburgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were refugees, if you will, at the airport without food,
water and blankets,'' Deputy Fire Chief Bob Khan said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Sky Harbor, which is run by the city, had
called on fire officials in such a situation. About a dozen
firefighters were dispatched.
</P>
<P>
   Khan said it was ``up to the policymakers'' whether the city
will bill America West for fire fighters' time and other ex penses.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe-based America West said its schedule should be back to
normal Saturday, but lines at gates remained long Friday evening.
Foul weather in the nation has compounded the delays.
</P>
<P>
   Tempers flared at times, and many stranded passengers com
plained that America West em ployees, although out in force, were
not doing enough to smooth ruffled feathers.
</P>
<P>
   As America West agents at one gate announced that they were
going to give $100 vouchers to passengers on a delayed flight to
Las Vegas, people began shouting, ``No!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want your $100!'' yelled David Harloff, 38, of To
ledo, Ohio. ``The voucher won't do me any good. I won't fly with
America West again.''
</P>
<P>
   After 27 hours of waiting, Tim Erdman finally boarded a plane
headed for Minneapolis on Fri day afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't waited for a plane so long since I was in the
military,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He says America West should have better explained things to
confused passengers. He stood in several long lines that turned out
to be the wrong lines.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Katz of Atlanta also was miffed about America West's
response.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent $856 on this ticket,'' she said, waving it in the air,
``and they didn't have the cour tesy to tell me until I arrived
here that the connecting flight from Phoenix to Atlanta had been
canceled.''
</P>
<P>
   The Terminal 4 baggage area was another scene of confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could have found our luggage, we would have been out of
here _ in a bus or rental car or something,'' said Dianne Reed, who
was traveling with her hus band and grown daughter to Santa
Barbara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised by how patient people are,'' Reed said. ``We
live stressful lives. This is just one more stress. You roll with
it. But inside, people must be seething.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurel Latourneau of Colum bus, Ohio, got in at 3:30 a.m. Friday
and waited at the airport with her husband and two small daughters
until 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened is inexcus able,'' she said. ``People are an gry
because America West wasted at least a day of their vacation. They
haven't offered us anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the hotels that America West gave vouchers for were
full, so people had to return to the terminal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I ran a company that was that disorganized, I wouldn't be
in business,'' said Cesare Con saga, 31, delayed for nearly 24
hours on a trip from Milwaukee to Burbank, Calif., via Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Clover Nyderek, 45, also bound for Burbank, had only waited 16
hours, but she was just as miffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have not been compas sionate to the customer here at
all,'' she said. ``Not one person has said they're sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Other passengers were upset because the delays were eating into
their Vegas vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's ridiculous,'' said Dana Scott, 41, of Wichita,
Kan. ``We even tried to get a rental car, but they were all gone.''
</P>
<P>
   America West spokesman Steve Johnson said problems for thousands
of travelers began about 11 a.m. Thursday when the airline began to
have trouble with a computer system that provides flight briefing
informa tion for pilots.
</P>
<P>
   A backup system also failed, and employees were forced to
prepare the briefings manually, which took far longer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was not caused by any Y2K-related problems or
sabotage, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The backup system was work ing by 7 p.m. Thursday, but by then,
flights were backed up throughout the system, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The airline brought in extra workers to provide customers'
assistance, and other workers stayed overtime, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to suggest that anyone deserves a pat on the
back for this, but given the circumstances, we did the best that
could have been done,'' John son said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Churchill, 28, of Wash ington, D.C., wasn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   He was supposed to meet friends in Vegas on Friday, then drive
up to Lake Tahoe for a ski weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill said he spent at least $30 on his cell phone and
calling cards trying to reach his friends, who were waiting for him
in Vegas. He ended up sleeping on the terminal floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was comical,'' said Chur chill, who said America West was
just pacifying people, not giving them any real information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come out and show me a flight schedule. Don't say, `How are
you doing?' I missed my flight. How do you think I'm doing?''
</P>
<P>
   As America West tries to get back on schedule, it is also facing
winter storms in the Midwest and Northeast that could significantly
back up flights.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was made worse because flights on other carriers
have been full heading into the Presidents' Day weekend. &QL;

GORE WALKS POLITICAL TIGHTROPE ON TRADE DEAL WITH CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (CHANGES ``agonizing'' to ``difficult'' in 2nd graf) 
 (rk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER and KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just a day after reassuring union leaders that he
would negotiate a tougher trade deal with China if elected
president, Vice President Al Gore felt obliged to write a letter
Friday to reiterate his support for the trade agreement that
President Clinton is trying to push through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, to a leading business lobby, underscored the
politically difficult position Gore finds himself in as he tries to
mollify two groups he desperately needs in the election, business
executives who have pressed for the accord and union members who
want to defeat it.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to court both, Gore has in the last few days led each
side to believe that it has his support in one of the nation's most
contentious trade disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's letter, to the National Association of Manufacturers, was
sent after White House officials had been left fuming by his
appearance before the AFL-CIO on Thursday in New Orleans. Although
Gore told the union officials that he supported the China deal, the
labor leaders said he had also reiterated in his closed-door
meeting that, if elected, he would negotiate tougher accords that
include guarantees that countries like China would respect labor
rights and environmental standards.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign played down any apparent conflict in Gore's
positions, but it was clear that his statements had unsettled the
White House, which was eager for him to clarify his position. But
campaign officials did not elaborate on any  &UR; &AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP; &LR; 
political considerations behind the letter.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore's comments in New Orleans circulated here on Thursday,
some administration officials who are working to win passage of one
of the biggest trade deals in history expressed fears that his
implicit criticism of the shortcomings could give ammunition to
those looking to sink the pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't exactly deft,'' an economic adviser to Clinton said
Friday. ``There was a clear argument to make about the national
security importance of this agreement, and he failed to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   One Democratic leader who has spoken to Gore and Clinton said:
``He's in an agonizing spot. He can't afford to alienate the
unions, and they've made this deal public enemy No. 1. And he can't
break with the president. So he's all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   But even in the letter he tried to walk a fine line. ``As I have
said publicly and privately,'' he wrote, ``I support the agreement
reached by our administration on the terms under which China will
be permitted to accede to the World Trade Organization.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an effort to keep union supporters from bolting, he
added: ``I agree with President Clinton that future trade
negotiations ought to include in the fabric of the agreement both
labor and environmental components.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future,'' he added, ``I will also insist on the
authority to enforce workers' rights and environmental protections
in those agreements.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   A top executive at the business group, Mike Baroodui, said:
``Gore's comments made a tough job even tougher. We were worried
that people who were looking for a plausible way out or even to
delay the vote could draw some aide and comfort from Gore's
comments. The letter removes that worry.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen how actively the vice president will push
the accord, because he cannot afford to alienate organized labor.
But the lobby was thrilled that the letter put him on the record as
clearly supporting the Clinton agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore insists that he would revisit China's adherence to
labor and environmental standards, as a practical matter he will
have little leverage. After China is a member of the WTO,
Washington will have lost its main negotiating leverage over
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   And after China is a member, it will join the other developing
nations that argue that ``labor rights'' and ``environmental
standards'' are simply code words for a Western conspiracy to force
them to pay higher wages and spend billions of dollars on
environmental measures.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments about whether the WTO should even examine the links
among labor standards, the environment and trade sped the collapse
of the trade talks in Seattle in December. Administration officials
now concede that that meeting was among their biggest blunders of
Clinton's second term. Gore, sensing the clash, carefully skipped
the event.
</P>
<P>
   But the AFL-CIO, among other groups, was greatly emboldened by
the Seattle demonstrations, where the protests led by union members
``shifted the debate about globalization,'' John Sweeney, the
president of the union federation, said this week in New Orleans.
``Coming off of Seattle, we are at a historic turning point.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinking the China deal is clearly the next objective, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Sweeney, who received a copy of the letter,
disagreed with those who believe that Gore had said anything to the
unions that undercut Clinton or the trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president has been consistent,'' Sweeney said. ``His
letter reiterates the position he took at the AFL-CIO convention in
Los Angeles in October. When the vice president addressed the
Executive Council on Thursday, he took pains to tell the council
that he supported the president on the deal with China.''
</P>
<P>
   In October, even before the China deal had been signed, Gore had
called for enforceable labor protections in trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders are focusing on members of Congress in pivotal
districts, an effort that makes many Democrats wary of signing up
with the White House. And for the first time, the unions are trying
to create alliances of convenience with conservative Republicans
who oppose the China deal on the grounds of national security.
</P>
<P>
   The unions are clearly overjoyed by Gore's vacillation. No one
expected him to break publicly from the White House, and in fact he
has repeatedly said he favors China's admission to the WTO. But his
willingness to talk about the need for a tougher deal sends a
signal that this one is flawed.
</P>
<P>
   The White House disagrees. ``This is an agreement that helps
American workers here and that ultimately lifts the standards of
workers in China over time,'' Sandy Berger, the national security
adviser, said in a recent interview. By gradually enveloping China
in a system largely run by Western standards, Berger argued, China
will see the benefits of changing its ways. In any case, he added,
``this agreement can't be renegotiated.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the unions hope that it can be. The president of the
United Steel Workers, George Becker, who has been pressing Gore for
two years to stop low-cost steel imports, said this week his union
would do its best to sink the efforts to win approval of the trade
deal. Then, he said, ``We're going to give the Gore administration
an opportunity to deal with it.''

OBSERVATIONS, NOTES ON EVE OF PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BY ROBERT ROBB  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - Observations and notes on the eve of the Arizona
Republican presidential primary:
</P>
<P>
   And the Academy Award for Most Audacious Performance in Managing
Expectationsin a Presi dential Campaign goes to . . . Arizona Gov.
Jane Hull for claim ing that anything less than a 30-point victory
for John McCain here would actually be a defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Participating in, rather than ducking, the first two presiden
tial debates would have done George W. Bush much more good than the
$50 million he has spent on his campaign so far.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a clue for Larry King. You've failed as a moderator when
the most memorable line in a debate is shared by all three
participants: ``Let me finish.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's claim that he merely ``misspoke'' when he told a San
Francisco newspaper that he opposed repealing Roe vs. Wade even in
the long term defies belief. If you truly believe in the pro-life
cause, that's just something you don't misspeak about. It would be
the equivalent of Ronald Reagan saying: ``You know, on second
thought, maybe communism isn't so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   There's something unsettling about the role Democrats and
Independents are playing in choosing the Republican nominee for
president.
</P>
<P>
   A political party should be a voluntary association of people
who share political principles and ideas. Sometimes those princi
ples and ideas are worth losing an election over. Party members
should have the right to nominate the person they believe would
best represent their cause, irre spective of the opinions of
non-party members about that choice.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the official legal recogni tion and role of the two major
political parties in our electoral system makes closed primaries
difficult to defend. Why should Democrats and Independents be
precluded from an election they are helping to pay for?
</P>
<P>
   In any event, attracting cross-over Democrats and Independ ents
isn't the only key to a Republican victory in November. Republicans
lost seats in 1998 not because they fared less well among these
groups. They lost because nationally there was a 5 percent smaller
turnout among Republicans than in 1994. Repub licans will need a
reason to turn out in 2000, a reason rooted in something more
substantial than just thwarting Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Al Gore would make mincemeat of any of the Republican
candidates in a de bate. Including Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   McCain can't be serious about also seeking the Reform Party
nomination if he can wrap up the Republican bid. Why would he want
to spend the summer fight ing with Pat Buchanan and Ross Perot,
rather than going after Gore?

   Although Bush has gotten more aggressive in the debates, he
still cannot take advantage of huge rhetorical opportunities. For
example, McCain has been allowed to turn Bush's endorse ments by
governors, senators and congressmen into a negative: proof that
Bush is the establish ment candidate.
</P>
<P>
   How difficult can it be for Bush to say something like the
following: ``John, these aren't kings and queens we're talking
about. These are men and women who have been elected by the people
of their states to repre sent them. And here's the bottom line. The
people who know me best, my fellow governors, think I would make
the better presi dent of the United States. And the people who know
you best, your fellow senators, also believe I would make the
better presi dent of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   That ought to tell the people of this country something.
</P>
<P>
   McCain continues to claim that he's never supported a tax
increase. Ignore, for a moment, the $500 million a year tobacco tax
increase he was prime spon sor of. In this race he's made a big
deal about closing off scores of what he calls tax loopholes. Did I
miss something? Isn't the whole point of closing tax loop holes to
cause some people to, well, pay more in taxes?

   LOS ANGELES _ Longtime employees of SDR Technologies Inc.
arrived at work Friday to find their company was sold for about
$117 million - and their loyalty would be richly rewarded in many
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 50-plus employees had a stake in the privately held
company thanks to a profit-sharing program. Their individual net
worths were still being tallied up late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had people that have been with us since we were just
three or four people and wondering how we were going to make
payroll - those people are going to do very well,'' said Chief
Executive Officer Kelly Kimball. ``We do have employees who will
have several hundred thousand dollars to their name, and a few who
are into the millions.''
</P>
<P>
   Who wants to be a millionaire, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Their windfall resulted from Overland Park, Kan.-based National
Information Consortium Inc. agreeing Thursday to buy SDR in an
all-stock deal. NIC will issue 2.1 million shares to shareholders
of SDR, a private company.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's closing price of $55.875 put the deal's value in the
$117 million range. Some of those 2.1 million shares will go to
employees who own stock in the company through a profit-sharing
plan.
</P>
<P>
   SDR Technologies designs and implements software that allows
governments to accept forms filed via the Internet, a concept that
seemed unusual in 1994, when SDR installed its first system.
</P>
<P>
   From the first program it designed - an election-filing system
for San Francisco - SDR has built systems for all levels of
government, said Kimball, who will be responsible for international
market development for NIC.
</P>
<P>
   The next step was an Internet filing system for the state of
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't making any money selling that, but we were very
happy with it,'' Kimball said. ``All of sudden, we had states
calling us for the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, car and boat owners in Michigan and other states can renew
their registrations over the Internet thanks to the Westlake
Village-based company. SDR also has prototype systems for other
government functions such as liquor control and professional and
business licensing.
</P>
<P>
   Kimball said SDR has contracts with 10 state governments,
several federal agencies and numerous municipal governments.
</P>
<P>
   The merger made sense for both companies, Kimball said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were growing into their business and they were growing into
our business - we've just relieved some of the competitive
pressures,'' Kimball said. ``The value is in our ability to produce
technologies that allow them to expand at a much faster pace.''
</P>
<P>
   The purchase positions NIC to dominate its industry, said Jim
Dodd, the company's president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other company will be able to provide the breadth and depth
of services we can deliver,'' Dodd said in a statement.
